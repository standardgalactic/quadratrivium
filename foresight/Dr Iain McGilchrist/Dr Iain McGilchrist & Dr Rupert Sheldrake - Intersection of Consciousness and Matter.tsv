0	13120	and welcome everyone. My brother-in-law Alastair McWhorter once wrote a short story where he said
13120	19040	the boys got up earlier than anyone has ever got up before, and that seems to apply to
19600	27120	some of our dedicated attenders from the US. I'm going to light a candle first before I say
27120	43440	anything else. And I've got a match that works today. Yes, there we are. Good. So a warm welcome
43440	51840	to this dialogue with Rupert Sheldrake and Ian McGilkerist. I've known Ian and Rupert for over
51920	61520	40 years. And so our connection goes back a long way. And I'd like to start with just a remark or two
61520	70240	on reading. And this comes from the obituary this week in the Telegraph of John Thorne, who was headmaster
70240	76400	of Winchester when I was teaching there and when Ian was a pupil. And in 1981, he was chairman of
76400	86160	the Headmaster's Conference. And he said, I do see a cloud bigger than a man's hand in the decline
86160	92720	of reading, he told HMC. If it is not done at school, it may never be done. And I think this
92720	99280	is a prophetic remark. And at Winchester, there's something called the DIV system, which is a
99280	105360	general studies where the don, the teacher, has a lot of latitude in what is read.
106160	114400	And while Ian was at Winchester, one of the books he read at the recommendation of his housemaster
114400	121040	was William James's Varieties of Religious Experience, which is a seminal book of Gifford
121040	130080	Lectures in Edinburgh, 1901, 1902. And so Ian read this when he was probably about 16.
130720	136560	Rupert didn't get around to reading it until quite a bit later. And just yesterday, I'd been
136560	142000	corresponding with a former pupil who was also a scholar at Winchester, Professor Ben Morrison.
142720	148080	And Ben is now the chair of philosophy at Princeton. And my first encounter with him
148640	155920	was that Simon Elliott, one of my friends who was a don as well, he sent him round with a six-page
155920	164640	essay aged 14 entitled, Does God Exist? And he went through the usual arguments. And so I pointed
164640	170640	him in the direction of William James and lent him a copy of Varieties of Religious Experience,
170640	178800	which he proceeded to read. And then we discussed it. And then Rupert appeared first in my
179920	185840	horizon, as it were, at Mystics and Scientists in 1983, when I was teaching at Winchester.
185840	190400	And he was lecturing on his then new book or new-ish book, A New Science of Life.
191360	198480	And I gave him a spare copy of this book here, which is called Talks to Teacher on Psychology
198560	205360	and to Students on Some of Life's Ideals by William James, which I'm sure is still somewhere in
205360	210640	Rupert's library. And then finally, this book here is incredibly important. It's called Human
210640	222400	Immortality. And it's the Ingersoll Lecture on Immortality, 1898, at Harvard University. And
222480	228880	just to start, Ian and Rupert, off, I'm going to read a couple of short passages from the
229600	237600	inclusion of Varieties of Religious Experience. And this is my paperback copy. I read it when
237600	246560	I was 26. And I remember reading part of it in the Beautiful Gardens in Marburg. So he says,
246560	250640	summing up in the broadest possible way the characteristics of the religious life as we
250640	258160	have found them, it includes the following beliefs. One, that the visible world is part of a more
258160	264960	spiritual universe from which it draws its chief significance. Two, that union or harmonious
264960	272240	relation with that higher universe is our true end. Three, that prayer or inner communion with
272240	278560	the spirit thereof, be that spirit God or law, is a process wherein work is really done. And
278560	286560	spiritual energy flows in and produces effects, psychological or material, within the phenomenal
286560	297120	world. And then another very short piece on the self. We have in the fact that the conscious person
297120	304320	is continuous with a wider self through which saving experiences come, a positive content
304400	310400	religious experience, which it seems to me is literally and objectively true as far as it goes.
311360	317520	And the other thing I just wanted to observe about Rupert and Ian is that they are both
317520	325200	voracious readers, and they have read widely and deeply all their lives. And their libraries are
325200	329840	pretty impressive. I have a fairly impressive library as well. So between us, I think we
330640	339680	we span a considerable range. And so I'm going to hand over to you, Ian and Rupert. And I think Ian,
339680	349600	you were going to open the batting as it were. Okay, yes, yes, that's good. I should refer to
349600	355360	Schopenhauer's view that never read books, reading books is for people who got no ideas of their own.
356240	363520	But anyway, can we spotlight Ian, please? And Rupert,
365440	373520	just wait to Rupert appear on the screen. There we are. Yes, I'm speaking from the bedroom of the
373520	383760	daughter of a friend in a flat in London. And yes, it's hard to get my I feel so
386240	390960	so much that I belong where I live that it's quite hard to sort of reconstitute my mental
390960	399040	world here for the moment. But I think what I want to say is that I've become more and more
399040	404240	convinced that none of the things that we desperately need to do to solve the various
404240	412320	problems that we we face and that we talk about a great deal, none of this in the end
413040	423200	will matter unless we are able to get back to the spiritual ground of our being. And in other
423200	429440	words, we could, by some sort of a miracle, we could, we could reverse the pollution of the seas,
429440	437360	we could perhaps do something to at least slow climate change, we could make it harder for people
437440	444080	to carry on felling ancient forests, all this I believe in powerfully. But I also think that
444080	451920	none of it will add up to a hill of beans unless we re-engage with the spiritual basis of a human
451920	457280	life. I don't think it will be any longer know what it is to be a human being. I think people
457280	462560	haven't the foggiest idea what they're doing here, what the cosmos in which they come into being
462800	469520	come into being is like and what their relationship with the earth that is their home is like.
471040	477200	And I'm just going to say a few things for you, but then ask you to respond to them really.
477840	485040	In the new book I wrote The Matter With Things, I suggest first of all that
485760	492960	many of the ways in which we look at the the constitution of the cosmos are upside down or
492960	498160	back to front. So in other words, we tend to think for example that the first of all there are
498160	503120	things and then there are relations between them, some of which we make in our minds, and that's
503120	510080	the way it is. Whereas I argue throughout a very long book that in fact relations are absolutely
510960	516080	primary. There is nothing that truly exists that is not a relation and is not in fact in process,
516080	524240	as Whitehead pointed out. So in other words, relations and processes are primary, not status
524240	530560	and things. And I also believe that for example, it's not that there's literal truth and that's
530560	537200	really the important thing and metaphorical truths are just some kind of semi-imaginary
538000	544560	extension of literal truth. In fact, I believe that all fundamental truths are metaphorical in
544560	551040	nature and that literal truth is just a very special kind that we've invented to describe
551040	558240	a small subset of things that occur at a very everyday level. But for the purposes of what
558240	565920	we're talking about now, I want to suggest that it's not that somehow there is anonymity and then
566000	576080	there is life and then there is consciousness and then there is a sense of the great values,
576080	582880	goodness, beauty, truth and the sacred. I think it's the other way around that what actually exists
582880	590240	fundamentally is a consciousness, which is a field of consciousness, which is divine, which
591040	598080	which has the qualities of attending to and drawing us towards goodness, beauty and truth
598960	606080	and the sense of the holy and sacred. And that it's for this that we've developed
606080	614320	our complexity as human beings, since we are not better than animals, but we are in this sense
614320	622320	above them that we can hope to respond to, to receive, to resonate with and to give
622880	629200	a full and fulfilling response to those leading values that draw us forward.
630080	634160	So that's the way I would like to think of it, Rupert. What would you say to that?
635760	640720	Well, I think of it in a very similar way and so do most people in the world for that matter.
641600	646960	If you actually look at, we live in a particularly godless part of the world, Western Europe,
648640	655120	but it's not quite the same if you go to Africa or India or many other parts of the world, or
656240	664960	Iraq or Iran or I mean the Middle East. Most people are religious in the world and
665920	673280	this kind of secularist, secular humanist, atheist, tinted culture that we have
674160	681680	is a historical anomaly. Most people were religious in Europe. And as Charles Taylor
681680	687760	in his wonderful book, A Secular Age, points out in the year 1500 in Europe,
688800	693680	everyone believed in God, everyone believed in the kind of vision you've just put forward.
693680	698800	It was almost impossible not to, not because people were coerced into believing that,
698800	706000	but because there was just no credible alternative. And what's happened is through the growth of,
706720	711200	first through the Protestant Reformation, the disenchantment of the world that happened
711760	719280	in part through the Protestant Reformation, a lack of emphasis on nature, a focus entirely on human
719360	725760	consciousness. And then through the Scientific Revolution, the Mechanistic Materialist worldview
726800	733120	that's grown out of it, we now have this very secular world where people think that
733120	738560	evolution and life starts from the bottom up, you know, from genes and molecules and cells.
739200	744560	And everything builds up until you've got big enough brains where the light of consciousness
744560	751840	mysteriously comes on. And then we start thinking about bigger things like God, but they're all
751840	757440	just inventions inside our own minds, and hence inside our own brains. And you'd be able to tell
757440	771680	us exactly where. No, I wouldn't do that. I mean, both you and I are discussing in what, in fact,
771680	775840	a whole scientific medical network has been concerned with right from the start is
777440	784480	trying to find a way back to a worldview that is still consonant with science, because science
784480	789520	isn't going to go away. And we've learned a great many things about nature through the scientific
789520	797760	process. But to recover a sense of this connection, which is actually there in all traditions, I mean,
797760	804160	shamanic traditions, all admit that there's a war or all just assume that there's some realm,
804160	808560	they have different views of it, but there are realms beyond our own that what we see is not
808560	815520	all there is. And as my main teacher, Father Bede Griffiths used to point out that, you know,
815520	825040	the center of all religious and spiritual culture is a direct experience of our minds, our consciousness
825040	830800	being part of something vastly greater than ourselves. And as he pointed out, all religions
830800	837280	start from that experience is not a dogma, it's an experience. And then they interpret it. I mean,
837280	844480	his favorite metaphor was the hand and that sort of central experience of unity is like the palm of
844480	849920	the hand. And then it's interpreted in different cultures, in different traditions, different
849920	855920	languages. They like the fingers of the hand, all the different interpretations of this primary
855920	861920	unit of experiences, sense of ultimate unity, which are interpreted in all these different
861920	868880	cultural ways. But that is the central foundation of all these religious traditions. And as far as
868880	875040	we know, this intuition that we're part of something greater than ourselves is very ancient. I mean,
875040	881840	all these cave paintings from 2030, 40,000 years ago, the practice of burying the dead and so on,
881840	888400	all the or dealing with the dead in a ritual way, all these things suggest that this has been part of
888400	895200	human consciousness for a very, very long time. No doubt the forms have changed and the development
895200	902240	of the great religions has sort of put a more unifying aspect on these insights. But it seems
902240	908000	to me that it's been foundational to human life for throughout almost all human history,
908000	916320	with the brief anomaly of Western Europe and parts of North America in the last 150 years.
918560	924400	Yes, of course. And it is worth reflecting on the fact that it would be entirely irrational
925120	930400	to suppose that we were aware of everything in the cosmos. Why on earth would we? I mean,
930400	936480	we know in the very simplest level that there are sounds that we can't hear but that bears and bats
936480	946640	can hear. So what we know is limited by our senses and by the relative unsophistication of our brains.
947680	954080	I say relative because relative to what there is for us to approach, if one has any kind of
954960	960800	sense of imagination, one can see that things that we sense are there and that, as you say,
960800	964960	throughout the world people have believed were there. This is not irrational. This is a very
964960	972480	reasonable supposition. And there are people in, for example, Australia, the native people there who
973200	978560	say they can hear and see things at a distance. They can hear people, ancestors speaking to them.
978560	984640	And who are we, frankly, to say that they don't hear those things? I like the, I think,
984640	993040	I'm sure you would agree, the very important idea of Goethe's that we develop senses to perceive
993040	1005120	things in response to the bits of experience that we are able to get. And that, therefore,
1005600	1012240	if we don't actually allow ourselves to experience certain things, then an organ that we might have
1012240	1019280	will atrophy. And I suggest that we've allowed organs that would help us to see these things and
1019280	1024560	hear these things and know these things. We've allowed them to atrophy and that people that we
1024560	1030320	consider more primitive than us and indeed our own children up to an age before they're
1030880	1037280	they're told that it's not it's not wise or intelligent to say that you see these things
1037280	1044480	of you're fantasizing. I mean, these people have the organs of perception that we need in order to
1046000	1052160	to reach the divine or to have any inklings of it. And I suppose that we all have enough
1052160	1058480	of an inkling of that that unless we shut it down, we can follow it and one hopes to grow it.
1058480	1064880	You know, Keats called this world a veil of soul making. And in other words, we are we are
1064880	1073520	nourishing or stunting the soul by the way in which we live. Yes, well, I think the
1075520	1084400	one way of looking at it is Charles Taylor suggests that in in Europe in say up to 1500 or
1084400	1092880	later, people had the idea that minds of porous porosity is a word he uses. And the anthropologist
1092880	1099280	Tanya Lerman, who's at Stanford, is I think one of the most interesting anthropologists of religion
1099280	1105600	writing at the moment. And in her latest paper, she talks about porosity in all religions, it's
1105600	1113600	assumed that our minds of porous to influences from each other influences from spirits, gods, angels,
1114240	1121920	other beings, that minds are porous. And what Charles Taylor shows is that since the 17th century,
1122880	1129280	there's been this shutting down. So the idea we've ended up ended up with is our minds are
1129280	1135520	completely insulated with inside the privacy of our skulls, nothing but the electrical
1135520	1141760	activity of our brains or other activities of the brains inside our heads. And they're all
1141840	1150560	separated off from everything else, completely privatized. And what Tanya Lerman shows is that
1150560	1159360	she wrote her most recent book is called How God Becomes Real. And the previous one was called
1159360	1167840	How God Talks Back. She's done anthropological studies of charismatic Christians, evangelical
1167840	1175520	groups, women, women praying in Tehran, Muslim women praying in Tehran, shamanic cultures and
1175520	1182320	so forth. She's done and she shows that in all these traditions, there's the idea that we're open
1182320	1189680	to spirits or beings of other kinds. But she also points out that this is actually something that
1189680	1197120	requires a cultural reinforcement and effort on our part. You know, if you believe in God,
1197120	1203680	it's not just a kind of passive belief that people who believe in God pray, they go to temples,
1203680	1210160	churches, services, they meet with others, they pray together, they have annual ceremonies,
1210160	1218560	rituals, practices, etc. There's a lot of work goes into making these beliefs more apparent and more
1219120	1226240	directly experienced. And I think something similar happens with people who have to put in
1226320	1232800	quite a lot of work to maintain the secular worldview, to maintain the secular atheist
1232800	1238640	worldview. Denying all these things involves quite a lot of hard work on denial. You first of all
1238640	1246240	have to deny all your own telepathic experiences and 85% of people have these experiences with
1246240	1251920	telepathic telephone calls. You have to deny that you can really tell when someone's staring
1251920	1258000	at you from behind and 95% of people have experienced that. You have to deny that you have
1258000	1264080	flashes of insight or mystical experience that appear to connect you with a consciousness
1264080	1270560	greater than your own. If you take psychedelics, which give a wonderful sense of connection with
1270560	1276800	something greater than yourself, you have to deny that that's real. But you just have to say, well,
1276800	1284480	that's just because chemical disturbances inside the brain. So even atheism and secularism
1284480	1293200	require quite a lot of effort in denial. And the motive for the denial, I suppose,
1293200	1301040	is fitting in with the secular world. And what the only positive side of it or is a self-congratulatory
1301040	1305840	feeling, you're smarter than everyone else, because you've seen through all these false
1305920	1312080	beliefs and childish attitudes that children have and so-called primitive people do.
1313280	1318560	When you were reading the Varieties of Religious Experience at school, I had a housemaster who
1319280	1327360	he was trying to show me the limitations of the orthodox Christianity in which the school chapel
1328320	1337200	we all had to go there every day. And I was reading bits of J.G. Fraser's The Golden Bow
1337200	1344080	and Robert Green's White Goddess. His aim was to prove to me that Christianity was no better
1344080	1351440	than these primitive, superstitious beliefs found all over the world. And since we were
1351520	1356960	quite happy to dismiss all of them as mumbo jumbo, the same applied to Christianity, it was
1356960	1362160	no better than them. And the first I was persuaded, I thought this was an appalling weakness because
1362160	1368880	it presumed to be superior to these other beliefs. I've later come to see this as tremendous strength
1368880	1375040	that it has so much in common with myth and archetypal patterns found all over the world.
1376000	1384000	But the idea that we're smarter than others, Fraser and all those late 19th century figures,
1384000	1390240	early 20th century figures, had the view that we've risen above the sort of animistic superstition
1390240	1395840	and then you get religion, which is a bit better, not much better. And then you go beyond that to
1395840	1400400	science and then you realize all that stuff, basically childish rubbish we've drove great
1400400	1407200	and out of. So I think that that's how we've got here. And I think it does take quite a lot of
1407200	1414400	effort, as I say, for people to maintain that belief. And I suppose that you would map some of
1414400	1423600	this, I'm just guessing, onto actors of different parts of the brain. Yes, maybe. I mean, before
1423600	1438640	we go there, though, you raised a number of interesting points. I argue also in my chapter
1439840	1449520	28 of the matter with things of the sense of the sacred, from evidence given by psychological
1449520	1457920	studies that actually it takes more effort to deny. It's not true that as Dawkins suggests that
1457920	1464160	we are indoctrinated into religion. In fact, it's the opposite that it takes more cognitive effort
1464160	1472080	to inhibit these ideas. That doesn't mean that they're wrong, of course. But it is interesting
1472080	1479920	that if you have people, and maybe that is to do with the brain, that some people, especially
1479920	1487920	people with autism, and who are something like a 10 times more likely to be atheistic,
1490880	1499200	the normal brain is actually allowing us to, if we will not suppress it, to experience the
1499200	1506400	sort of things that you're talking about. And going back to my idea that the things that we
1506400	1513680	think are primary are not, and the things that we think are secondary are not. So in the case of
1514240	1521280	oneness, you were talking about how we have to go back to an idea of being porous. But this is,
1521280	1527520	as you're suggesting, I think this is the natural state to see ourselves as in connection with the
1527520	1539200	world. And you get in panpsychism a very interesting phenomenon, which is that people say, okay,
1539200	1545040	so how do we, okay, maybe the logical position, since we can't see how to get
1545840	1550640	consciousness out of mere lumpen matter, maybe the answer is everything's got consciousness in it.
1550640	1554960	But then how do we recompose it? You know, how do we put this together? It's actually called
1554960	1559280	the combination problem. This is typical of the left hemisphere, which having, first of all,
1559280	1565360	ruptured a unity, then doesn't know how to, quote, recreate the unity. But the unity is there.
1565360	1571840	The unity is primary, not a secondary phenomenon that has to be put together and achieved.
1573120	1580160	So I think that that kind of panpsychism is, is somewhat irrational and left hemisphere dominated.
1580160	1584240	Now, you've brought me to the position where, of course, I've mentioned hemispheres.
1585680	1590080	And I should say to anybody listening that my position is not that the brain
1590960	1595840	creates our experience at all. I say that logically, there are three possibilities,
1595840	1604480	the brain either imits experience, or it transmits experience, or it permits experience.
1604560	1610560	And I, I believe that in fact, the brain is a permitter of experience that shapes it,
1611360	1617280	much as the vocal chords, as William James pointed out, are what shape his voice,
1618160	1623920	a restriction, a constriction and inhibition and negation, some kind of molding or
1625360	1633200	no saying to the breath that would come through. If there was no such molding or permitting,
1633200	1641120	then there would be no voice at all. But coming to the boring stuff about brain correlates,
1641120	1647920	we do know that I'm afraid it just isn't a matter of fact. And I give, I think it's appendix
1648720	1656320	seven or something in the matter of things. I do go over the science on hemisphere difference in
1656400	1668080	spirituality in relation to mindfulness, meditation in general, and shamanism, religious
1668080	1675280	experiences of certain kinds. And the overwhelming evidence is that this requires a shift of balance
1675920	1686080	away from the normal slight, uh, bias towards the left hemisphere. In these experiences, one finds
1686080	1692640	that this imbalance, if you like, is redressed and not only redressed, but that the centers
1693600	1701280	that are subtending these kinds of experience are very clearly right hemisphere related. So
1702080	1709840	in a culture which I believe promotes the values of the left hemisphere, sees the world as particulate,
1710400	1719360	made up of isolated things that are fixed, that are unchanging, inanimate, abstracted,
1719360	1727600	explicit. There is no room for this kind of, this kind of experience. Indeed, I was talking yesterday
1727600	1733200	to clergy in Canterbury, and I don't know what they thought of it. But I was trying to explain
1733200	1738400	that all the sort of things that you need in order to open your mind to the existence of a divine
1738400	1744400	being are militated against by the natural mode of the left hemisphere, which is to pin things down,
1744400	1752960	to look for certainty, to focus on the explicit rather than the implicit, to see things as naturally
1752960	1762480	inanimate rather than animate, and to be all the time cataloging and charting experience as on a map,
1763040	1769200	or having a theory about it rather than actually allowing experience to come to you. To do that,
1769200	1773920	you've got to have an opposite cast of mind, which is in fact the cast of mind that the right
1773920	1782240	hemisphere enables for us in daily life, which is the voice of a way of seeing things in which there
1782240	1787680	is no final certainty. There are things that are probable, and there are things that are more likely
1787680	1793360	than others, but there's no final certainty. Nothing is finally separated from anything else.
1794480	1800640	Nothing is ever completely fixed. It's always moving, changing and flowing. All the really
1800640	1806560	important stuff cannot be put into language. Anybody who's been in love knows how incredibly
1806560	1812320	feeble the language is to deal with this extraordinary experience. And of course,
1812320	1819520	any of you who are listening who are persuaded that there is a spiritual realm, a divine realm,
1819520	1828320	that you can have intimations of, this again is beyond conceptual reduction in language.
1830320	1838560	The right hemisphere enables us to be more willing to accept paradox, to accept things
1838560	1845200	that are not certain. And this is the realm where we find the spiritual life.
1847600	1855200	Yes, the sense of not certainty, I mean, there is a sense though in some spiritual experiences
1855200	1860400	where there is a great certainty. I mean, for example, people have had near death experiences,
1860400	1866080	or mystical experiences spontaneously, or as a result of spiritual practices,
1866080	1874080	or as a lot of psychedelics. I mean, I myself, when I've had some of these types of experiences,
1874080	1878640	one of the things that people say about them is that you know that it's real, that it's
1878640	1886000	more real than normal reality. And near death experiences which last a few minutes,
1886960	1893040	change people's lives because they feel they've contacted a realm, a reality which is
1893040	1898320	more real, more certain in a way than the ordinary world we live in. And they don't
1898320	1902880	have any doubt that there's this spiritual reality because they've directly experienced it.
1903440	1909840	Now, I don't know whether that, to what extent that depends on one or both hemispheres,
1909840	1919280	or whether it goes beyond the brain altogether. But what's so convincing for many people about
1919280	1922880	these experiences is precisely that they seem unquestionably real.
1923840	1930560	Yes, raises two points really. One is this. I would make a distinction between
1931520	1939120	the absolutely certain and an asymptotic approach to certainty. And the left hemisphere
1939120	1945840	has a category of things that are yes and no. And I don't think that experience, well,
1945840	1951120	not in my experience, there is ever this, I'm not lucky enough to have had one of these experiences,
1951120	1956080	but I imagine if I had one, I'd say I'm almost as certain of this as I can be of anything,
1956080	1962240	which is different from claiming absolute certainty or absolute truth. But the other
1962240	1967840	thing about it is something that my housemaster Martin Scott, the man who really modeled for me
1967840	1976640	the wonderful relation between a man who was profoundly sane, very funny, hyperalert to the
1976640	1983520	ridiculous, was also a deeply spiritual and in that sense, a very serious person. And he
1983520	1989680	modeled and conveyed to me that way of looking at things. And one of the things he emphasized to me
1989680	1998160	was that the true religious experience is not really about these moments of certainty or about,
1998160	2003840	you know, levitating or seeing the future or any of these things nice as they may be. They are not
2003840	2009920	the center of it. And that in fact, they're not particularly prized by the mystics who had these
2009920	2019200	experiences and not particularly prized actually by the Buddhist masters. They don't think that
2019200	2024960	these amazing transformative experiences are really what it's about. But it's typical of our
2024960	2030320	society that we would imagine that there is an experience of this kind. And it's not about a
2030320	2040480	more humble application of a kind of disposition towards the world, which is one of awe and humility
2041680	2047440	and compassion, which I believe is at the center of it. So I'm not disrespecting extraordinary
2048080	2055200	experiences. I'm just saying that I'm a skeptic amongst believers and I'm a believer
2055200	2062880	amongst skeptics. I've always been like this. And when people do this, I find myself suddenly
2062880	2069040	running to the other part of the balance here to sort of keep things properly in perspective.
2070800	2075440	Well, speaking from my own experience, I've had these moments of insight where I've just
2076000	2083600	known that there's a greater consciousness than all my experience. But on a day to day basis,
2083600	2090400	those are quite rare, those experiences are not like every day. And that's where spiritual practices
2090400	2097920	come in. And I myself meditate in the mornings and I pray in the evenings. And I see these as
2097920	2104160	different daily ways of relating. I see the meditation, I think I was more like breathing in.
2104720	2113120	And I close my eyes, I try not to be occupied with the things in my room or wherever I'm doing it.
2114560	2122000	I have mantras, I concentrate on the mantra and sit quietly, and thoughts go through my mind and
2122000	2128480	so on. And so it's a way of withdrawing not only from the outer world, but also from the inner world
2128480	2134800	of the default mode network of constant inner chatter, what it still goes on, but you detach
2134800	2140800	from it and you just let it pass and so on. So that's like I think like breathing in, whereas
2140800	2147360	prayer I experience in is almost the opposite direction, petitionary prayer. You start with
2147360	2153600	an invocation or prayers start with an invocation, our Father who art in heaven, Hail Mary full of
2153600	2162480	grace, Om Nomah Shivaya, O Allah. You start with an invocation to being graced in yourself, a form
2162480	2168400	of consciousness graced in yourself. And then in petitionary prayer, we're asking for things which
2168400	2174320	is the most common or common or garden form of prayer, I mean basic found all over the world in
2174320	2181440	all different traditions. You then direct intention towards things that in the outer world,
2181920	2189520	someone who's sick, a problem that you're worried about, some threat you want to pray for protection
2189520	2196880	or defense. So it's very practical about the affairs of everyday life and the immediate
2196880	2201840	problems in one's life. So in that sense, it's like breathing out, it's going from a spiritual
2201840	2209360	center towards the outer world, towards actual particular problems. And so I see these as both
2209920	2215280	ways. I see them as complementary to each other and breathing in and breathing out metaphor
2216480	2222240	is shows I mean, we can only breathe out because we breathe in and vice versa. So
2223360	2230320	have the flow in both directions. But these are a way of coming to a center within one's
2230320	2236560	self where one's consciousness is connected to or one can sometimes experience this connection
2236560	2243440	to a greater ground of being or consciousness. And then praying is connecting that center to
2244640	2250320	the affairs of the world. Both of these increase the sense of porosity, the idea that one's
2250320	2255200	consciousness is related to something greater. And also that the everyday affairs that one's
2255200	2261280	concerned with and the problems in the world and hopes and fears and all that are related to
2261280	2267200	something greater than oneself as well. And I think that everyone who prays and it's in if you
2267200	2272880	take the whole world, most people pray, even if you take Britain, far more people pray than
2274240	2280320	actually go to church or have regular religious practices. I think these are ways in which on
2280320	2286720	an everyday basis, we have a greater sense of this connection. Well, I like very much that image of
2286720	2294320	breathing in and breathing out naturally. And I don't, I don't in any way deny your experience, but
2295120	2303920	I'm also immediately reminded of St Francis's admonition that when you pray, you should ask for
2303920	2310880	nothing, nothing. He's very emphatic about it. I think Mother Teresa said much of the same thing.
2311520	2318320	And I remember the words of the infant Samuel, was it speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.
2318320	2323760	When the one's praying, it's more about listening than talking. But it doesn't mean that one doesn't
2323760	2332960	remember people that one cares for and cares about. It would be odd and counter-intuitive
2333840	2343520	to do that. So I think one bears them in one's mind, in one's care, and one commends that to God.
2346000	2352080	If one asks for anything, one has to, after all, couch that with the words, you know,
2352800	2362640	if it so be your will. I do ask for things, I suppose, but I'm slightly conflicted about it.
2362640	2367440	I think that the greater part of praying is actually creating a space in which something
2367440	2373200	can come to you. Indeed, I think all creation and imagination is not about going out
2374000	2380320	and doing something, but about creating a space for something to happen.
2381760	2388720	As I often say, a gardener can't make a plant. All the gardener can do is create, create a space
2388720	2394640	for the plant to flourish or stifle the plant, but the plant has its own existence. And I think
2394640	2402160	that whatever the spirit, the divine spirit is trying to bring to us, we crowd out with our own
2404000	2413040	desires, our own wishes, our own formulations, and that being open is about creating a space
2413040	2420560	for things to happen. I'm going to just mention here this extraordinary notion of the creation
2421200	2425840	that comes from the Lurianic cabala, the prime being, the ground of being aims off.
2427040	2435120	Being relational, as God is and as love is, needs a creation to return that love, to be
2435120	2440480	the object of that love, and to realize the relationship with the loved one, which must
2440480	2446800	be free. And so what is the first act of aims off in creation? It's something called sim sum,
2446800	2452240	which means withdrawal, and that is a withdrawal to make a space in which there can be something other
2452240	2464480	than this creature, this ground of being, not a creature. And then there are 12 of them that are
2464480	2469760	in this space to catch whatever it is that comes out of aims off. The single spark of fire comes
2469840	2476400	out of aims off and lands on these vessels and shatters most of them. And the third
2476400	2483520	act of creation is called tikkun, which means repair. And this is the particular
2484960	2493040	honor, duty, purpose indeed of humanity is to repair these shattered vessels and to make
2493040	2500800	them more beautiful than they were before. And in that image, I think of this Japanese
2500800	2506480	art of ceramics called kintsugi, in which you repair a shattered vessel, but it's more beautiful
2506480	2513920	than it was before, often repaired with lines of guilt or gold that come into the ceramics.
2513920	2520560	So this idea of creating a space for things to happen, drawing back and being unknowing and
2520560	2527520	undoing is, I think, very important. Well, personally, I see that as more the role of
2527520	2533360	meditation. I mean, there are various forms of prayer. Contemplative prayer or meditation
2533360	2541360	is creating a space. I'm meditating quite often. I mean, I'm not meditating in order to have sort
2541360	2548240	of ideas, but quite often, ideas pop into my mind about things of work I'm doing, ideas,
2548240	2554240	scientific experiments and so forth. But petitionary prayer, I mean, there's an amazing
2554240	2559040	range of opinions. I used to belong to a group called the epiphany philosophers in Cambridge,
2559600	2566640	and we had retreats together. We had Easter vigils and we had masses at various times of the year,
2566640	2573280	which the priests who celebrated them for us at one stage was Ron Williams, who is a member of
2573280	2581680	this group. And once I was thinking about prayer, and we prayed together, we did matins and even
2581680	2588480	song every day together when we were on retreats. And I then said, well, could we go around the
2588480	2593760	circle? We all knew each other very well, and just say something about how we ourselves prayed.
2594560	2601040	And it was astonishing. I had just no idea these people I prayed with many times saw it say
2601040	2606400	differently. Some thought that we shouldn't ever pray for anything specific, a bit like you,
2606400	2610720	you know, could hold people before God and or hold them in the light of God, but not
2610720	2617840	tell God what to do because God already knew everything. So absolutely not right to do that.
2618640	2625120	Others prayed very, very specifically, as Jesus does in the New Testament, and Jesus is not just
2625120	2630560	holding people specifically, caring specific people. He didn't care everybody when he walked
2630560	2637920	into the room, he'd care one person at a time with a particular personal sort of act of healing.
2639200	2647280	So it was much, it was really quite specific. And so there was a wide range of opinion about
2647280	2653200	how specific we should be. And those who believed in the specificity would say it's not telling God
2653200	2659360	what to do, it's being co-creators with the divine that God works through us. An idea similar to what
2659360	2665600	you just said God works through us. And he asked for God's guidance in our prayers. You're not just
2665600	2672080	coming up with ideas, I want to have a new car or I'd like to have more money or something like that.
2673200	2680160	It's not like God in prayer is like celestial Amazon with delivery next day.
2680720	2689840	Yes. I remember a joke about that. I prayed for a new bicycle, but then I realized God doesn't
2689840	2702480	work like that. So I stole a bicycle and prayed for forgiveness. But I do, you see, I'm trying to hold
2702560	2710240	together two uncertainties, which is always my problem. I really respect what you're saying.
2710800	2716560	And of course, whether you call it prayer that caused Christ to heal people or something else,
2716560	2722400	I don't know. But the C.S. Lewis pointed out the idea that prayer will produce the outcome we desire
2722400	2728960	can be completely dispensary because the holiest of all petitioners in the Garden of Gethsemane
2728960	2734640	prayed three times for this cup to be taken from him and it simply wasn't. So we can
2736160	2742480	assume that this is not the way that prayer does work. Having said that, I believe that
2743440	2749440	disposing one's mind towards an outcome and disposing many people's minds towards an outcome
2750000	2756880	may help that outcome come about. I don't know quite how and it may be by modes that you're
2756880	2764720	more articulate about that we call parapsychological but are probably entirely natural.
2766480	2773840	Yes. I think forming the intention you see is part of this co-creation. And I think the power of
2773840	2778640	praying together. I'm a regular church girl because I like praying together. I like singing
2778640	2785440	together and I like being in a holy place with members of the community who pray together. So
2785520	2790880	I go wherever I am on Sundays and small village churches on local parish church here in Hampstead
2790880	2796800	or wherever I am. So I think that creating an intention together is very, very important.
2798160	2805360	And of course the secularized version of prayer and intention is positive thinking
2805360	2811360	which is huge in America. For a hundred years or more there have been all these books on
2811360	2819280	the power of positive thinking. Where you form an intention and then to sell more vacuum cleaners
2819280	2828240	or icopedios and then you sell more because you form the intention. And one of the most perverse
2828240	2834720	examples of positive thinking is of course the former president Donald Trump who was raised in
2834720	2842640	the church of positive thinking. The chap who was the prophet of positive thinking what's he
2842640	2848640	called Norman. I've forgotten the name for the moment but the power of positive thinking.
2848640	2852880	I don't have anything to do with these pop psychologists. Norman Vincent Peale.
2852880	2858320	Oh yes, Norman Vincent Peale. That's right. I did. You know the power of positive thinking.
2858320	2863600	He was the minister of something called the Marble Church in Manhattan where Trump's family went
2863600	2870800	and as a teenager Trump imbibed all this. So Norman Vincent Peale married him to his first wife.
2870800	2875840	So he was absolutely raised in formative on positive thinking and the idea is you just
2875840	2880320	say something and you can make it come true through power of intention. So he loses the
2880320	2885360	election so he says he's won it. You know this is pure positive thinking taken to its most
2887040	2891120	In my terms it's pure left hemisphere thinking because the left hemisphere
2891120	2895600	and believes that it has power to create the outcome at once and there's always an optimism
2895600	2902480	optimism and if something doesn't work out the way it believes it will deny that black is black.
2902480	2911440	It will say a paralyzed limb is such that they can use it freely and so it's power to deny
2911440	2917040	reality in order to fit in with its theory about reality is the defining feature of it
2917040	2923600	and I would say that you know Trumpism is just an expression of this mentality and not one that I
2923600	2930480	particularly want to take as my guide. Oh I certainly don't. The point about it is you see
2930480	2937760	that it's a kind of debased or secularized form. Yes I know what you're saying. It's about getting
2937760	2944080	what you want through positive thinking. You have success in love and business through positive
2944080	2948480	thinking. That's why these books sell so well. You know they're all about selling more of the
2948480	2955520	product and getting ahead and so forth and the basic principle that forming intentions can
2955520	2961680	actually have effects in the world but the point about proper prayer positive things about me
2961680	2967440	getting what I want through the power of my mind and that's where the left hemisphere goes magical
2967520	2976160	as it were or attempts to. Whereas the normal prayer I mean I myself being Christian always
2976160	2980240	start my prayers with the Lord's Prayer and part of that is right at the beginning is
2980240	2986480	Thy will be done so it's a prayer in a much as you were mentioning into a much larger context
2986480	2993760	of God's will and the larger purposes of which I'm a part and I play a part within that larger
2993760	2999680	pattern but if you and I suppose that would be more like a right hemisphere thing because it's
2999680	3005440	part of a global vision of what's happening in the world but then you could say the secularization
3005440	3012960	of prayer as it removes the right hemisphere aspect until it becomes left hemisphere activity
3012960	3017600	but I think positive thinking can't be understood as a movement or a practice
3017600	3024080	without its background in petitionary prayer from which it's kind of truncated derivative.
3025120	3030560	Yes no I think that's fine I don't think we need to to disagree too much about this
3032720	3039120	I mean I suppose that the touchstone for me is the is the holocaust I mean all these innocent
3039120	3045360	people and innocent children treated with utmost barbarity and you suppose that
3045360	3052800	the decent people, Jews, Christians and others did not pray that they should be spared this but
3052800	3061120	they weren't so you know that that is a I can I can there is a theodicy I think which is simply that
3062640	3068080	whatever God is God has to allow his creation freedom otherwise it's simply an extension
3068080	3075040	of himself and it's not another that he can love it is not a creation so that that creation
3075040	3083360	must have the freedom to do good or ill and unfortunately a lot of time we do evil.
3084480	3092240	Anyway let's talk about many other things as the walrus said what should we move to
3092240	3096880	panpsychism or would you like to talk about consciousness and matter or the nature of
3096880	3106320	time or where should we go? Well I think while we're on consciousness and I think one the view
3106320	3110880	that you started with you know our present bottom-up view I mean the traditional view is
3110880	3116880	the opposite that starts with consciousness that consciousness underlies all things
3118240	3126480	and then the whole of nature is produced through consciousness in the christian version
3126560	3130800	in the creed it says the cosmic christ you know through him all things were made
3131600	3137600	that there's a part of the divine the second person of the holy trinity the logast which is
3137600	3145440	the realm of names and forms it's through all creation is divinely or comes forth from an
3145440	3151440	ultimate source of form and structure that everything in that sense shares within the
3151520	3159040	divine consciousness god is in nature nature is in god and that is not panpsychism but
3159040	3166160	panentheism the idea that god is everywhere in nature and that nature is in god so god is
3166160	3174640	the mind of god transcends nature it's not just nature because of pantheism and so I think what
3174640	3182160	we've got at the moment now coming to panpsychism is the this the main driver for modern panpsychism
3182160	3187120	is to try and as you said to solve the hard problem because the hard problem is that if you
3187120	3191840	have a materialist view that the whole world is made up of unconsciousness or nothing else
3192800	3198640	there's no consciousness out there the only consciousness there is is inside brains and
3199360	3205840	moreover the maximum amounts inside human brains and maybe lesser amounts in dog brains and
3205840	3214080	elephant brains and perhaps tiny amounts in worm brains or ant brains that that consciousness
3214080	3220000	is confined to brains the entire universe is unconscious except on this planet and it's
3220000	3226000	unconscious on the entire planet except for the inside of human and animal heads that's the standard
3226080	3231520	view but it has the problem then of saying well if the whole universe is unconscious mass
3231520	3236640	unconscious how come we're conscious everything ought to be unconscious and then as you know
3236640	3241840	a lot of philosophers of mind of a materialist persuasion try to pretend we're not conscious
3241840	3247840	it's an illusion it doesn't do anything that's a happy phenomenon ridiculous yes let's try and
3247840	3253600	get rid of consciousness no so the panpsychist so you know the bright boy at the back of the class
3253600	3258800	and among materialist philosophers of mind said well what if have we say electrons and atoms are
3258800	3263840	a bit conscious then and we can explain our consciousness there's a difference of degree
3263840	3270800	not of kind but they usually end there once they get to the human brain they think they've made
3270800	3276320	their point and that's where panpsychism ends but as you know i've tried to carry this argument
3276320	3281120	further in in my paper in the journal of consciousness studies is the silent conscious
3281840	3287760	i tried to go with this panpsychist move and say okay well let's say that there really is this
3287760	3294720	kind of panpsychism then why stop at the human brain the sun is self-organizing system vastly
3294720	3300080	larger than our brains with vastly more complex electromagnetic patterns why can't the sun be
3300080	3305200	conscious why can't other stars be conscious and indeed whole galaxies with higher levels of
3305200	3312640	consciousness and then clusters of galaxies and then the entire cosmos and of course this is not a
3312640	3321280	new idea then Plato and platinus and many others talked about the world soul the the whole universe
3321280	3327600	having a kind of soul mind or organizing principle and that would be a kind of pantheistic
3328720	3334400	global consciousness but then the traditional view is that that itself has embedded within the larger
3335520	3340160	more inclusive source of consciousness which is in the end the source of nature
3340160	3346480	but so panpsychism as we currently have it is a fairly limited form of panpsychism it's a kind
3346480	3353760	of materialist panpsychism which just attributes kind of epiphenomenal consciousness to material
3353760	3362800	structures up to indicating the human brain yes yes well as you possibly know i'm a panentist
3362800	3369200	and it's a very different thing from being a pantheist but there is a way in fact of
3370160	3379200	approaching what is meant by panpsychism further towards panentism and almost making it
3380640	3387680	making them a union if you start from the idea that there is separate stuff in the realm of
3387680	3394160	matter and that you've got to find a union to it then you have this famous combination problem
3394160	3404480	but if you start from the view as i do that the promptly the ontological primitive is consciousness
3404480	3411360	there is nothing you can get beyond or behind you can't go beyond or behind consciousness
3411360	3418800	consciousness is the ultimate reality i was asked yesterday by clergy well is consciousness god and
3418800	3426880	i suppose yes but no because i don't want to sort of limit what god is rather in the panentistic
3426880	3436560	way consciousness is a divine creation but what i see is that matter is a mode of manifestation of
3436560	3448160	consciousness so at times it is it is something that is immaterial or appears to be but we only
3448160	3454480	know what we call material things because we have consciousness we don't know that we have
3454480	3459040	consciousness because of material things such as brains but we do know the one thing where
3459040	3465120	can be certain of his consciousness which is why it's so particularly annoying that people
3466240	3472160	are sitting on well-paid and prestigious chairs in american universities claiming that consciousness
3472160	3478800	is an illusion but anyway and consciousness is the basic reality and people say well matter
3478800	3484240	doesn't look like consciousness but then i suggest that we think about it as a phase of it in the way
3484240	3490800	that ice is a phase of water you know water is translucent and flowing and so forth but ice is
3490800	3498160	is static and opaque and extremely hard and so hard it can split your head open and in this room
3498160	3503520	there is a a tunnel more of of water in the atmosphere otherwise i couldn't breathe so
3503520	3507760	they don't look like one another but which is the real water they're all real water and i think the
3508400	3517120	there are all these ways in which consciousness can manifest and one of them is in what we call
3517120	3522480	matter and why should there be matter well i suggest there's matter because it provides
3522480	3532720	two important things for creation it provides importantly an element of resistance nothing
3532720	3540480	can come into existence without there being some element of resistance or something that moves
3541360	3548880	against that that trend of of creation i mean you know everything has this dual aspect you
3549840	3554480	what is friction friction stops movement certainly but it also starts movement without friction you
3554480	3562080	can't move and without there being some definition which means literally the the limits to things
3562080	3568320	that can't be the whole world that we experience with all its magical beauty and complexity so it
3568320	3575440	brings that degree of of a resistance and it brings a degree of temporary permanence in other
3575440	3582480	words the things i'm saying disappear as soon as i say them may linger in somebody's mind somewhere
3582480	3587680	for a few seconds but you know the desk at which i'm sitting will be here tomorrow absent a world
3588240	3595760	so those are the ways i would see it and that is completely constant with what you were saying
3595760	3600720	about the divine being what you're really saying is the divine is imminent and the
3600720	3606160	divine is transcendent and it's holding those two together which we can in the form of the trinity
3606160	3612320	trinity the trinity is the best explanation of panentism that there is you know it's like the
3612320	3619120	image of a book what is a book is it the thing in the mind of the creator or is it the the volume
3619120	3623920	here on the table or is it what happens when that volume is taken up and read by somebody
3623920	3630320	the book is all three of those but in different senses and this is what roomy said in one of his
3631040	3641120	meditation the spirit is the well spring it is the cup that conveys the water and it is the water
3641120	3646480	that quenches the thirst of those who are thirsty so i just thought i'd throw that in because i think
3646480	3654160	it's one way of making panpsychism a much more interesting phenomenon a much closer to panentism
3655760	3662400	i agree i i think that the best model of ultimate reality is trinitarian and we find it in many
3662400	3668400	different traditions as my favorite book on this is david bentley hart's book the experience of god
3668400	3677120	being is bliss where he shows that the an indian model sat chit ananda is is one way of looking
3677120	3683040	at this and sat is the ground of all being that which sustains all things all being and chit is
3683040	3690400	consciousness which is contains names and forms namarupa names and forms that the contents of
3690400	3696160	consciousness has is consciousness about things and these names and forms it's roughly what play
3696240	3702560	to call you know the platonic realm of ideas in the christian trinity is the logos and then
3702560	3709120	ananda joy or bliss that the divine consciousness is blissful which is why mystical experiences of
3709120	3715440	union with god are usually blissful because the divine consciousness is blissful now in the christian
3715440	3721600	model where we have god the father is the ground of being and the logos as the the second person
3721600	3728480	the trinity the names and forms which give form shape structure coherence to everything which
3729120	3734240	underlie the order and form of the world and also the order and form of our minds which is why we
3734240	3740320	can the traditional view is why we can understand nature is because they have a common source their
3740320	3746720	minds and the natural world and then the holy spirit which is the dynamical moving principle
3746720	3753600	wind energy breath flames flying birds you know it's the dynamical principle
3754560	3763840	i find that the when we understand matter as a combination of form and energy with energy
3763840	3770480	according to physics matter like an electron or a proton or an atom are organized by quantum fields
3770480	3776320	which give form the energy within them is the same energy we see in light and light can turn
3776320	3781360	into matter and matter can turn into light energy is promiscuous and can take any form
3782320	3788960	so what we have in nature is a universal energy this is a scientific view as well as a religious
3788960	3797520	view and we have a whole range of possible forms that energy can take and the source of both
3798240	3805040	energy is is the ultimate being and the source of both and the primary metaphor is of course
3805040	3811760	speaking because when i speak i'm the speaker the words i'm saying have formed structure shape
3811760	3818000	connection with each other meaning and but in order to say them i have to be breathing up there
3818000	3825200	has to be a flow of air and if i have just the words they're silent in my mind if i have just
3825200	3833760	the flow of air it's a kind of white noise of undifferentiated energy but the two together
3833760	3838800	make the words which can then relate and communicate and give structure and meaning
3838800	3844960	so i think that this metaphor i find this particular metaphor of the holy trinity particularly
3844960	3851760	helpful yes yes well i'm glad i i would endorse every word of that but i thought that we might
3851760	3857600	segue from there to the relationship between energy and matter we know that they're interchangeable
3857600	3866000	and e equals mc squared is a the most famous expression of this idea and i'm i'm very interested
3866000	3876960	in your idea which i believe will be adopted by mainstream science eventually when they catch up
3876960	3884000	which is that there are form fields of energy possibly electromagnetic energy which govern
3884560	3894400	the shapes of things and are also the cause of memory so there are memories that are stored
3894400	3901440	in form fields i believe this this is something that you would you might want to
3901440	3908640	demur but i think this is my understanding um because of course i mean i'm sure people are
3908640	3914560	aware but when we we've done this heroic task of decoding the genome you know which i don't want to
3914560	3923280	diminish in any way it was a staggeringly um clever and and and some brilliant piece of work
3923280	3927120	but at the end of the day what we discovered this is almost nothing there i mean there's
3927120	3934000	absolutely there's not just not quite enough information as but by many many orders of magnitude
3934000	3940080	far far too little most things are just simply not there and it reminds me slightly of that
3940080	3946000	episode of faulty towers i think it's number five of the first series where um the chef gets drunk
3946000	3953200	and um basal faulty has to go off to a restaurant and and get a duck for the for the gala evening
3953280	3957520	and unfortunately somebody switches the the plates around and so he takes away what he
3957520	3963200	believes is a duck but is in fact a blamance and he walks into the dining room with this sort of
3964160	3970000	i've got it here now and then he goes voila takes off of it and there's a blamance and he goes
3972080	3979840	nothing there and i i sort of see this as the state we're in now that we we thought we've got it
3979840	3986800	but actually it's not there so on a more serious note you you sent me a couple of papers that i very
3986800	3992160	much enjoyed um one of them was fairly technical but it explained itself at the end and what it was
3992160	4000800	really saying is at the lowest level of neurons and uh transmitters and so on there is no stability
4000800	4007120	or there is little stability not enough stability to say that any kind of memory is stored in this
4007200	4012320	pattern of neurons or whatever because it shifts it shifts in the brain after very short while it
4012320	4019440	may go somewhere else so but what is stable is not the manifestation in the brain substance
4019440	4023840	but some kind of electromagnetic field now expand on that Rupert please
4025360	4034880	well and i think both genes and uh brains have long been overrated um and in in the in the 1970s
4034880	4040480	and 80s these human genes would explain everything which is why literally billions of dollars were
4040480	4046240	poured into the human genome project as you say when it came when it finished you know they thought
4046240	4050880	there'd be a hundred thousand genes that you'd be able to patent them and make fortune and stuff
4050880	4058480	there are only 20,000 and you know rice plants have about 45,000 and see a few more than us so
4058480	4065120	it's not it's not it wasn't at all what was expected and then all these attempts to explain
4065120	4071520	hereditary in genome-wide association studies we compare tens of thousands of people's genomes
4071520	4076240	and they look at their height and where they get breast cancer where they you know schizophrenia
4076240	4082800	etc what do the genes actually explain well they explain about 2.5 percent of the inheritance of
4082800	4088240	schizophrenia less than 10 percent of the inheritance of breast cancer less than 20 percent of the
4088240	4095440	inheritance of height and yet these things are known to be heritable and so the genes don't
4095440	4103520	explain it so that's called the missing heritability problem in the trade and they try people have
4103520	4108560	tried to fill that gap with epigenetics the inheritance of quiet characters which was as
4108560	4114480	you know taboo in the 20th century absolutely I think it depends on morphic resonance the
4115520	4122080	connection of the kind of memory across time as you know is one of my favorite theories
4123120	4129360	and the same goes for memories in the brain that morphic resonance depends on similarity
4130320	4134880	any organism is more similar to itself in the past than to any other organism
4134880	4140480	therefore the most specific resonance is from its own past I think this maintains the form
4140480	4145760	of organisms even though the cells and the molecules turn over I mean our own molecules
4145760	4152880	are changing time and cells coming and going but the form remains more or less the same
4152880	4158320	and in the realm of memory I think that we resonate with ourselves in the past and that's how memory
4158320	4165120	works that it's not stored as the materialists believe they have to believe that it's material
4165120	4169680	in the brain because they've got nothing but material to explain things and so it has to be
4169680	4175520	material traces and people have tried over and over and over again for more than a hundred years to
4175520	4181360	find these memory traces storing memories in brains and they've proved ever more elusive
4182080	4186960	and the paper you were referring to is where people have looked in mouse brains
4186960	4192480	inserting extremely detailed electrodes so you can get tremendously fine grain picture of what's
4192480	4197840	happening in the in the brain and we know that brains have waves going through them it's not
4197840	4203680	just granular nerve cell activity it's we've known from electroencephalographs for years that there
4203680	4210240	are global wave patterns what this new study shows is that these wave patterns are highly specific
4210240	4216080	and very particular patterns of waves when a mouse learns something and when it remembers it
4216080	4220800	and when they first discovered the characteristic wave patterns they said oh we've located the
4220800	4227280	memory here they are these waves in this bit of the brain that in between when learning and remembering
4227280	4232640	they must have been stored in the cells in material traces that somehow then come to life in the form
4232640	4238800	of waves again but then they found that the wave patterns remain the same when they remember it
4238800	4244800	the same pattern but the pattern can move to different bits of the brain it it's it's not
4244800	4250400	in particular cells it's it's the ability of the nervous tissue to produce wave patterns that
4250400	4260240	underlies the memory and this is called representational drift so the standard theory of memory
4260240	4265440	just doesn't work and I think memory and the memory of form and the inheritance of form and
4265440	4270640	instinct I think instincts like habits of the species inherited by morphic resonance
4271200	4277840	um so I think that the the the standard materialist view trying to build it all up from granular
4277840	4287040	genes is simply falling apart through you know the um the inheritance problem um
4287040	4291680	the missing heritability problem and through things like representational drift and the
4291680	4299680	failure to find memories in the brain this of course has huge implications for consciousness
4299680	4305280	because the materialist view is that when we die if memories are all stored in the brain and the
4305280	4312480	brain decays then oblivion is the only possible outcome of death whereas all traditional belief
4312480	4320080	systems have had some sort of life after death whether it's a shadowy ancestral realm in Hades
4320080	4327200	or whether it's you know life after death or whether it's reincarnation all of them involve
4327200	4333520	a transfer or survival of memory beyond the survive beyond the death of the brain all of those
4333520	4338720	possibilities are ruled out by the materialist theory which is why it so fits well with kind
4338720	4346080	of atheist worldview um because it rules out a lot of religion is about thinking about consciousness
4346080	4352640	in a big picture including the possibility of life after death or whether it's our consciousness
4352880	4360640	resorbed into the ultimate consciousness or whatever um it they all assume most religions
4360640	4366000	assume that it doesn't just stop when we die whereas the materialist theory of memory says
4366000	4374080	that's the only possible option quite quite but am i right in understanding i mean i know you like
4374080	4380960	myself have had conversations with michael levin who is an evolutionary biologist at Tufts
4381680	4388160	um i think you've had conversations with him am i right yes yes i went to visit him actually i
4388160	4395840	admired him a few years ago when i was giving a talk at harvard i i went to um to visit him
4396880	4402080	and we we spent some time together in his lab and that was a purely private conversation but
4402080	4409600	did you find that there was um that he had moved towards i my sense is that he doesn't
4409600	4415120	actually want to embrace it fully or publicly but that he basically is a deeply sympathetic to
4415120	4422080	this way of thinking yes he is his his whole way of thinking is about holistic organizing
4422080	4430640	principles which are more for genetic fields that's my starting point um he's the the great
4430640	4436240	thrust of his work is that biology is organized by fields sort of top-down organization of the
4436480	4442560	development generation rather than building it up from the bottom from genes which simply doesn't
4442560	4451680	work no but there's a form of teleology or passive behavior in all living things that there's a
4451680	4457680	global organizing principles that are hierarchically organized and you've got cells within tissues
4457680	4463600	the cell has its own form of organization its own intelligence and the tissue containing millions
4463600	4469920	of cells as a higher level of organization and the organ a higher level still in the organism
4469920	4477280	and the society but this view is almost i mean it's very similar to what i i think and the one
4477280	4483040	thing he doesn't have is morphic resonance you see and um i he certainly knows about it because
4483040	4488480	when i went to visit him he pulled out a very well in thumb copy of my book a new science of life
4488560	4494800	my first about morphic resonance he asked me to sign it and and i know he's read it with great
4494800	4500560	attention and yes i mean he's very widely read i don't claim that i'm special privilege particularly
4500560	4507440	for me but or my book but um he's very widely read but he's certainly very aware of the holistic
4507440	4513840	tradition in biology very rooted in it and very very well aware of his history um you know going
4513840	4522320	back to the early 20th century people like greech and and the school i mean he's very aware of that
4522320	4528960	in a way that most biologists aren't and i think that he's hovering i think he'd love morphic
4528960	4535760	resonance to be true but he doesn't mention it he doesn't talk about it he doesn't do research on it
4535760	4544080	because he knows that this would mean he's at present has a very influential position within
4544080	4550320	biology it's he's very rare uh it's very rare for someone who has a holistic perspective to have such
4550320	4558080	wide influence in where molecular biology has dominated things for so long if he's started coming
4558080	4565120	out in favor of morphic resonance you know he'd be proclaimed a heretic like me and and this would
4565120	4571600	fall apart so if somebody else got good evidence for morphic resonance i think he'd be pleased and
4571600	4576480	i think he'd start doing work on it but i think he's in a position where he could take the lead
4578480	4585440	yes uh while you were talking about this intelligence of cells you know which is
4585440	4591680	something i'm very interested in i've written about in the matter with things um even a single cell
4591680	4600480	can inventively repair its own form although it's not programmed any rare in its genome to do so
4600480	4608160	and has no experience itself of such a repair being needed and in many ways that's a small
4609600	4616000	element in a picture which is much bigger which is in a good point that i think was made by um
4616880	4624800	fsc schiller or fcs schiller uh which is that when somebody's had a brain injury
4626000	4631600	how is it that other parts of the brain sort of know that they need to reconstitute this element
4631600	4636640	it is entirely different from anything that the machine can do because it involves a
4636640	4641680	conceptual pattern of the whole where it recognizes there's something that needs to be brought into being
4642640	4647680	rather like the idea of a representational drift there's another part of them on a much
4647680	4651760	bigger scale and more dramatically that one another area of the brain must be recruited
4651760	4657200	to do this job and that suggests that there is a form of what is going on at a higher level
4657200	4664960	which is exactly what they're finding in in the brain science of memory that you are talking about
4665040	4673680	so i think that's that's wonderful now that's why in the 1920s when the idea of morphogenetic
4673680	4679680	fields was first put forward people liked the field idea because if there's a field organizing
4679680	4686000	the development of an organism or a cell and if you damage it the field is still there which contains
4686240	4695040	wholeness and can account for regeneration and the analogy was with magnetic fields because
4695600	4700880	fields are intrinsically holistic even the fields of physics and after all fields were
4700880	4707280	only introduced into science by faraday in the 19th century in the 1850s before that it was
4707280	4713360	just purely mechanistic no pushing and pulling billiard balls and things although newton's
4713360	4721040	gravitational theory implied interconnectedness of the entire universe but the emphasis in classical
4721040	4726640	mechanics was on pushing and pulling and fields in a way are still involved in pushing and pulling
4726640	4732400	but um that they're through what i'm pulling than pushing i make a distinction i think the
4732400	4737840	things that push from behind are very mechanistic and hydraulic but that actually what we need to
4737840	4743200	be thinking about are those things both spiritually morally intellectually and biologically that draw
4743200	4749440	us from in front well yes of course magnetic fields push or pull if you put the same poles
4749440	4754960	together yes that's true but it's not symmetrical because if you shake up a whole lot of magnets
4754960	4761680	i sometimes do this for fun um they they automatically line up they repel each other
4761680	4768160	until they pull and so it's not that repulsion attraction comes out above repulsion because
4768160	4775040	you end up with interconnected magnet you don't end up with lots of repelled separate ones so
4775040	4780880	of course i love that they're repulsion and attraction are symmetrical in in an iron magnet
4780880	4788640	the rhythm is the domination of attraction and that sounds a very good point which to
4788800	4792000	um have a break
4794800	4800720	i have to sort of cut you off somewhere um because the conversation has been so wide
4800720	4805360	ranging and fascinating that you brought things out of each other um which is probably
4805360	4810240	you know new and fresh and that's what i think is so exciting about a dialogue
4810240	4813840	and where you have a creative interchange
