1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,240
Well, Alex and I are about to talk about a book that I wrote over about the last 10 years called

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,360
The Matter With Things, subtitled Our Brains, Our Delusions and The Unmaking of the World.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,720
I was very fortunate that Alex approached me to talk some more about this. We don't know how many

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,840
sessions we will do, but we thought we'd start at any rate at the beginning of the book and discuss

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,600
that and see where we go. Alex is a remarkable person. I'm personally in awe of his curriculum

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,880
vitae. He is a theoretical physicist by training and has a couple of doctorates in physics,

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:03,600
but he then retrained as a biologist and has worked on molecular biology and empirical zoology,

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:13,120
but also on the theory of the theoretical aspects of biology and is currently a professor at the

9
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:23,680
Institute of Neurosciences in Alicante. He is a person with a remarkable breadth of interest

10
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:32,640
and mind. This is very nice for me because I find that I don't easily fit into any particular box.

11
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm generally interested in philosophy and have been since my younger years. I started out training

12
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,920
in literature and humanities and then read medicine and became a psychiatrist with particular

13
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:56,720
interest in the overlapping areas of psychology and neurology. We need to see what happens and

14
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,280
I'm very excited about it. Well, thank you again. It's a pleasure, really, and an honor to take

15
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,440
part in this journey with you and to continue learning from you and with you as we cover your

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,720
really, really remarkable book. Thank you. Well, thank you very much.

17
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,200
Before going on, I thought I might just give a brief overview of the introduction, which is

18
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,800
something like 50 pages long, and it's that that we're going to be discussing this morning. See how

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:39,360
that goes. This particular book, The Matter with Things, arises from something I have been

20
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,720
thinking over all my adult life, which is that there is something wrong with the way in which we

21
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:55,200
are taught by popular science and many of the voxpop thinkers that are on the internet, the way

22
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,920
we're taught to think about the world. And it's really part also of the way in which we educate

23
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:08,800
the young. That is to liken it to a machine, a mechanism that has meaning only insofar as we

24
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,480
put it into that world. But when we come to look at the world, what we're really faced with is a

25
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:26,720
collection of meaningless fragments of material stuff colliding with itself in ways that are to

26
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:34,320
an extent predictable, but largely chaotic. And that this has no intrinsic beauty, complexity,

27
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,720
structure, meaning, or direction. That has never seemed to me at all convincing.

28
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:51,760
What I want to do in this book, or what I wanted to do in this book, was to explain why that vision

29
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,760
of the world is to me not a convincing one and to offer an alternative. So in the introduction,

30
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,960
I ask us to reconsider some of our assumptions about the world. For example, that there is only

31
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:13,920
there is only matter that that matter is naturally speaking, static until it is set in motion,

32
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:25,920
that things are essentially atomistic until they're connected by us, that structures are,

33
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:35,760
in essence, simple, and then evolve from that simplicity into a greater complexity. And what

34
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:44,560
to suggest is all these ideas are wrong, that we've inverted the evidence that we have before us.

35
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,240
The evidence is, I will argue, that consciousness is every bit as real as matter. And that matter,

36
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,040
in fact, is something we know secondarily by consciousness, not the other way around, that

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,640
the natural condition of things is not as in the Newtonian universe out of stasis,

38
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,360
but is of motion. And what needs to be explained is not how things come to move,

39
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,160
but how they ever come to be static. And I indeed argue that they are never truly static.

40
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:24,880
I will argue that the world is not principally chaotic, nor that structures are, in essence,

41
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,920
simple. These are products of the way we come to look at the world. In fact, there is no such

42
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:40,880
thing as chaos. Randomness cannot really be any more than approximated. Everything has intrinsic

43
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:51,440
structure. And what is simple in our eyes is simple, not because it's somehow what existed

44
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,840
before things became complex. Things have always been complex, but our way of looking at them can

45
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,120
share off most of the picture that surrounds what we're looking at, and thus make it appear simple,

46
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:13,360
and to obey simple linear laws. Whereas, in reality, nothing in the cosmos behaves in this

47
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,520
mechanistic way. So those are some of the assumptions I set out with. And then I want to

48
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,120
talk about the way in which the two hemispheres of the brain change the world that we look at,

49
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,240
because obviously, if I'm interested in examining what we can take as more real,

50
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,120
more true than anything else, we need to take into account that how we tend to the world changes

51
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,760
what is there for us to see. In an earlier book called The Master and His Emissary,

52
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,720
I explained that the two hemispheres of the brain have evolved as all neural networks that we know

53
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:01,920
are going back 700 million years show an asymmetry. Why is there this asymmetry? It appears to be to

54
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:09,840
with the most basic problems of survival for any living creature. And that is how to pay attention

55
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:19,040
to an isolated detail, something that is a mortal that we want to eat, prey that we want to catch,

56
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,560
a twig that we want to pick up to build a nest, anything that we want to grab and get and manipulate,

57
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:33,200
which requires a highly focused, targeted attention to a precisely visualized detail.

58
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,920
And at the same time, not for prey ourselves to predators that are in our surroundings.

59
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:49,680
So at the same time as paying this very focused, detailed attention to one particular item,

60
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,560
we need to be paying the exact opposite, a kind of broad, open, sustained, vigilant attention

61
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,680
in which we can see what is unfolding around us. We can see dangers, we can see the presence of

62
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,480
the creatures that form part of our social network, those that we want to nourish,

63
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,560
those that we need to flee from. So that is a very, very essential aspect of being alive.

64
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,400
And in the human case, it is eventuated in the two hemispheres of the brain, which are

65
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,120
different in a number of respects, but all of these can be traced to the way in which they

66
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,520
pay attention. If, as in the case of the left hemisphere, you pay this very narrow,

67
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,600
beam, highly focused, targeted attention to detail, then the world appears to be

68
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,440
created out of a heap of fragments, little pieces here, there, and everywhere that are

69
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,440
isolated atomistic in themselves, meaningless, sheared off from any context that might give

70
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,880
the meaning static, because this is the attention that fixes and freezes things so that you can

71
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:08,400
get hold of them, and essentially inanimate. Whereas the right hemisphere, seeing continuity

72
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:15,440
over time and continuity over space, sees a world in which everything is interconnected seamlessly,

73
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,720
in which things are never fixed but constantly changing and flowing, in which context is vital

74
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,920
importance to understanding what it is that we're looking at, in which everything is charged with

75
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:35,120
many layers of meaning, and which is essentially an animate world. One way of looking at this

76
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,440
difference is that the left hemisphere sees something like a very simplified diagram that

77
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,280
we create after the event of experience. So the right hemisphere, as it were, experiencing the

78
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:55,440
world, it is bringing the thing into being for us, and the left hemisphere is representing,

79
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,880
in other words, literally after the fact of it's being present, is making it present again,

80
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,400
when it no longer truly is present, in the shape of a theory, a diagram, a schema, or a map.

81
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:14,400
And this difference between the world in theory and as it is mapped by the left hemisphere, which

82
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:21,120
sees everything in mechanical terms, is quite different from the living vibrant world that

83
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,640
the right hemisphere sees without making presumptions about its mechanical nature.

84
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,920
Because I'm suggesting that attention changes the world, I need to clarify that I don't mean

85
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:42,720
that we make up the world in a purely idealist way, that there is no real world at all, but it's

86
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,880
just what the product of our mind produces. I'm not saying that, but I'm also not saying that there

87
00:10:51,840 --> 00:11:01,360
is just simply, naively, a world out there that is purely objective and has nothing of us in it,

88
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,680
and that the way to understand it is to exclude our attention entirely from the process. That will

89
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,240
produce certainly a version of the world, but a very remarkable one in which everything that

90
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:21,760
makes it valuable to us has been taken out of the picture. Then I give some of the core ideas of

91
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:30,240
the hemisphere hypothesis, as I have developed it, some 20 perhaps differences that one can see

92
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,120
between the ways in which the right and left hemisphere deliver the world, the nature of

93
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,880
those differences, and they address some of the potential causes of confusion. So over the last

94
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,800
decade or so people have raised perfectly valid questions about what it is I'm saying, but which

95
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:56,080
are misunderstandings of what I'm trying to convey, and so I address some of those. I also

96
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,840
address the question of should we go beyond the facts. This is something that scientists sometimes

97
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,360
say when one looks at scientific findings in a philosophical way, as though they had

98
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,360
as though they had significance for us as human beings. There is no way they cannot have

99
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:24,400
significance for us, and most great scientists have also seen that what we find in empirical

100
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:31,680
science helps us shape the picture of the world. And what I want to do is to reintroduce philosophy

101
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,000
to science and science to philosophy. They're natural companions. In fact, until probably 200

102
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,080
years ago they would have been thought of as aspects of the same business of coming to understand

103
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:52,480
what there is in the world. And I think that I can offer a way in which we can make progress in

104
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:00,400
philosophy, because in following the argument that I lay out both in the master and his emissary

105
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:09,360
and in the matter with things in more detail in the more recent book, one can see what the hallmarks,

106
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,680
the characteristics are of the way in which the world seems to the left hemisphere and the way

107
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:24,720
in which the world seems to the right hemisphere. And if it's possible to evaluate how reliable

108
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:32,880
either of these visions is, we can then, for the first time, make some progress in philosophy.

109
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,640
If there are two conflicting points of view, we don't just have to shrug our shoulders and say,

110
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,880
well, some people say this, and some people have said that. We can say, yes, this particular vision

111
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,760
is typical of what happens when the left hemisphere gets hold of the world and tries to make sense of

112
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,120
it. And this other picture is an attempt to convey what the right hemisphere sees there.

113
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,320
Now, if, and that's of course a big if, which we will have to explore, if we can show that one of

114
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,680
these visions, and spoiler alert, I'm going to suggest that this is the vision of the right

115
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:15,520
hemisphere, sees more of what there is, and is a more reliable witness for us to base our activities

116
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:22,160
in the world, our experience of the world, our reaction to the world on, then we can make that

117
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,440
step and identify where certain trains of thought are to be attributed to the right or the left

118
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:37,520
hemisphere. And I think that's probably enough to say here, except perhaps to give a brief note

119
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,760
about the structure of the book. So it's in three parts, although physically in two volumes. The

120
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:51,600
first part of the book is neuropsychology, in which I aim to look at the ways in which we can get a

121
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:59,440
hold on the world at all, the means or portals whereby the world comes to be experienced by us.

122
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,480
And I take those to be things like attention, perception, which is not the same as attention,

123
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,240
judgments formed on what we tend to and how we perceive it, the ways in which we grab hold of

124
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:21,680
things and use them in the world, our emotional and social intelligence, our cognitive intelligence,

125
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,640
and indeed our creativity, all these help to bring about the basic view of the world that we have to

126
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,720
operate on. The second part of the book, as I've mentioned, is epistemology. I look at what are

127
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:42,880
the ways open to us to take further the data that we have through those portals or means that I've

128
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,560
just described. One of them is science. We can, in the practice of science, we can use our senses and

129
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:58,320
our various intellectual and imaginative faculties to create a picture of the world that helps us

130
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:06,000
understand it. Another would obviously be reason. A third, I suggest, would be intuition and a

131
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,920
fourth, imagination. And I look at each of those in part two of the book and suggest that, in fact,

132
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,160
we cannot dispense with any of these, but need to bring them to bear in different ratios and in

133
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,800
different ways on everything that we come to look at. And that's interesting in each case,

134
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:33,120
the view of the right hemisphere is the one that gives most power to each of those paths to truth,

135
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,440
toward truth, because of course we can't ever actually reach that truth in itself.

136
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,000
And that takes me to part three, which is the second physical volume of the book,

137
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,280
which is metaphysics. When we apply what we found in parts one and two to the universe,

138
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:59,360
what do we find? And this involves looking at the basic elements of the cosmos, things like

139
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,400
time and space, matter and consciousness, but also things such as values and the sense of the sacred.

140
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:14,480
So that is the outline of the book and it's that that I try to convey in this introductory part

141
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,840
of the book. So Alex, that's probably as much as I need to say at the moment, probably more than

142
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:27,920
enough. And I'd like to hand over to you now, because I'm sure you've got comments and questions.

143
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,640
Sure. I mean, that's fantastic. And one can see there's so much to unpack. And that's

144
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,640
the reason why we're doing this, actually, to have this conversation. So yours is obviously

145
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,080
an ambitious task. And it's an important task. And you argue that it's also an urgent task.

146
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,840
And as you also mentioned a minute ago, and there are all these isms, right, materialism,

147
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,720
reductionism, representationalism, or there are all these connection of isms that in a way,

148
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,720
well, you're fighting against or even better, you're trying, as you said, to invert or correct

149
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,480
kind of the hierarchy or the superiority they have on other ways of understanding the world.

150
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,560
Now, a distinction that you make that I think it's really, really powerful. And that's what I

151
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:17,440
would like to discuss now for a little for a little time is this distinction between apprehending

152
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,680
and comprehending as as illustrating this radically different views of seeing the world.

153
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,040
And one has to do with manipulation, of course, and the other one with understanding. And I think

154
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,080
just from the words themselves and the roots of the works, it is very powerful both as a summary

155
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:41,680
and also as a as a root of the of the cause of all these preference for certain isms that you're

156
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:47,600
saying pop thinkers present as if they were true, actually, which are, in my view, abstractions.

157
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:55,840
And to confront these with experience, and also a avoiding the common distrust we have

158
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,760
on experience. But I wanted to ask you about experience later, but maybe we could continue

159
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,520
with apprehending and comprehending, because it's very useful to me.

160
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,600
Yes, thank you for drawing attention to that. I use the word apprehend in a specific sense,

161
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,360
which is its original sense of grasping hold of something. And this comes from the Latin root

162
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:26,240
add and prehendery, prehendery, to take hold and add to go to it and take it. And this is

163
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,960
the function I suggest from an evolutionary point of view of the left hemisphere to enables

164
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:42,720
us to manipulate the world. The right hemisphere, I suggest comprehends helps us understand the

165
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,920
world. And that comes from a root and Latin meaning to take together. And that's really an

166
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:56,880
important point, because an awful lot of what I'm talking about is what follows from whether you

167
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:05,280
see things as a whole, and only move to focus on a part, taking into account that you're looking

168
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,280
in an artificial way as part of a whole. And the other way of looking at it, which is you try and

169
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,240
break it down into the smallest parts, you can understand those and then build it back up from

170
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,560
there. That is, of course, how we make a machine. And so it's the obvious way in which the part of

171
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,320
the mind that grasps things and takes them apart wants to view the cosmos itself, which it didn't

172
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,360
actually make, but imagines it is something like a machine that we could have constructed.

173
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,000
So that's an effective difference. And as I say, a sort of sound bike would be the left hemisphere

174
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,280
helps us apprehend or grasp and manipulate the world. The right helps us comprehend or

175
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,920
understand it. And that distinction, as I say, is an ancient one going back at least 700 million

176
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:59,040
years, and explains the otherwise baffling fact that the brain, a structure that is made to make

177
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:05,120
connections, and this power exists only in the number of connections it can make, has an enormous

178
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,120
divide down the middle. It's also asymmetrical. Why? And the band of tissues at the base of the brain,

179
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,320
the corpus callosum that connects those two aspects is often inhibitory. A lot of the work

180
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,520
it does is to tell the other hemisphere, keep out of this while I deal with it. That suggests that

181
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,640
there are two potent ways of viewing the world that mustn't interfere with one another if they're

182
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,040
each of them to work well to the end that they're designed to fulfill. All right, I'll come back to

183
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,400
apprehending and comprehending later. But since you, let's jump into the bihemispheric structure

184
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:46,800
of the brain, because that's also the soil on which all these ideas will grow. And so we have

185
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:53,200
these neurological facts that you've studied and put together in a remarkable way, because that

186
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:00,000
seems to be sometimes far beyond what one person alone can hold in their mind. But there are these

187
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,800
neurological facts that we will of course unpack. But then from here, you draw psychological

188
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,080
implications. And as you said, even later, also metaphysical consequences, not just from the

189
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,000
neurology, but also from physics and from philosophy itself. So maybe we could discuss a bit now,

190
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,320
or as much as needed, what are these neurological facts and probably advancing one of the usual

191
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,280
criticisms of the split brain hypothesis and what it means, which is that, well, fine, sure,

192
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,320
you know, there's split and there are all these inhibitory connections and so on. But

193
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,680
people may not be so comfortable saying more than that, as you were saying at the beginning,

194
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:50,000
like, drawing real-world consequences of what's purely, in a way, neuroscientific data. But let's

195
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,200
not say that there are two brains and two minds and two ways, because that seems hand-waving. I

196
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,960
think it's not at all. And probably that's a foundational stone of your whole argument. I

197
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,240
think it would be very useful for everybody to realize and for us to explain, for you to explain

198
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:14,480
us that, yes, there has been some pop psychological understanding of it, and you're not saying that.

199
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,040
You're saying something more precise and more potent in a way. So it's a good time, perhaps,

200
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,920
for you to explain that, if you may. Yes, that's a good idea.

201
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,040
I think it's not passed into popular culture that the idea of differences between the brain

202
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:42,880
hemispheres is somehow an exploded idea that carries no scientific credibility. And that's

203
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:50,480
because after the first brain operations were carried out in the 1960s and 70s in California,

204
00:23:51,760 --> 00:24:04,080
the remarkable operations, we were able to study the phenomenology of one isolated hemisphere at a

205
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,240
time and see what it is like. And it was discovered that, indeed, the phenomenology of the left hemisphere

206
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,800
and the right hemisphere are, in fact, very different. The fact that we're not aware of that is

207
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:23,280
because evolution has taken care to hide it from us if we were aware that we're kind of fusing two

208
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,760
quite different visions of the world all the time. We wouldn't be able to do anything. We would be

209
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:36,400
completely incapable of action. But the fact that there was some very simple minded deduction

210
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,880
that's made in the early days, such as that the left hemisphere is linguistic and rational,

211
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,760
and the right hemisphere emotional and artistic, they may have vestiges of truth in them, but only

212
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,080
vestiges, because the picture is very much more complex than that. And each hemisphere, in fact,

213
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:04,960
deals with everything, including reason and emotion, and including creativity and reason.

214
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:12,800
So the old differences are to be dispensed with. And I think one of the first things I would say to

215
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,360
anybody is, put out of your mind everything you think you know about the differences between

216
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:25,680
the left and right hemispheres because they will be wrong. So it is an important distinction to

217
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:31,840
make, and I'm not just following up the old vision, but the question won't go away.

218
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,160
There is, at the core of our being, this fascinating division in the brain, and therefore

219
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:47,680
inevitably in the mental world. Why is it there? And what is its nature? And I unpack those ideas

220
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:55,920
in the whatever it is, nine chapters, I think, of part one, and we'll probably look at those in

221
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:04,160
greater detail on another occasion. Yeah. So here, let me add a kind of a food note

222
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:11,600
referring to your biography in a way, because I think it's remarkable that what you're putting

223
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,920
forth is it is a brave endeavor in the sense that you're walking a fine line, right? Because you're

224
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,440
emphasizing how the structure of the brain shapes this way of attending the world that we have as

225
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,480
individuals, and as a society, and as a culture, and as a civilization, right? But at the same time,

226
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,920
you have to be very careful, and you lay it out in the introduction where you explain first the

227
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,040
kind of headline differences between the hemispheres, and then the common confusions, because

228
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,440
since the publication of the master and his imagery, you've had time to see

229
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,240
what people think and what they criticize, right? So you need to walk this fine line by saying, well,

230
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,480
yes, I'm drawing a lot of neural data, but I am not saying that mind is just a derivative of

231
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:02,560
brain stuff, and so on and so forth, right? And this is also related to your path as a scholar,

232
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:09,040
right? Where you wanted to study this, which seems this hemisphere difference, which maybe

233
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,800
seemed like a worn out idea, but it was actually underexplored. So you were advised not to do so,

234
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,840
as I understand. Nevertheless, you went for it, right? So you see how interesting, I mean,

235
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,480
just again, it's a food note, because we'll go back to the content again. But I think,

236
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,440
as you ever say, context is being something very important. I want to draw attention to the fact of

237
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,680
the context as you, of you as a scholar, while approaching these ideas, because that's important

238
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:41,120
in the wider picture of things. There are these ideas that either are pushed to the side,

239
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,240
and if you want to go and study them, you're usually advised not to do so, because that's not

240
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,000
career building, but it's in doing that, that one can make progress. So if you don't mind to

241
00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:00,000
tell us a bit more about that path of yours, and we can quickly go back to the content of the book,

242
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,880
if you wish. Yeah, as I mentioned, I, for my life, really, I've been interested in philosophical

243
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:18,400
questions. And in philosophy, one is looking at the structure of ideas, putting them in

244
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,720
contrast with one another, in connection with one another. And this is in some ways, the opposite

245
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:33,120
of what people often think the process of science should be, which is taking things apart, and looking

246
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:42,160
at them as separate discrete facts or data points. And this is so strong that we've lost really the

247
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:48,320
whole purpose of science, which in the end, yes, you have to do a lot of analysis, a lot of taking

248
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,520
things apart. But the purpose of doing so is not fulfilled just in doing that process. That's an

249
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,600
intermediary step. The whole point of doing that is to be able to use that information to enrich

250
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,680
one's understanding and one's picture of the whole. And in fact, I start from a point made by

251
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,600
Erwin Schrodinger in the years just after the Second World War, when he was lecturing in Cambridge,

252
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:20,160
Schrodinger, of course, one of the great figures in the development of quantum mechanics in the last

253
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:30,320
century. He said, really, the point of scientific research is only fulfilled in as much as it begins

254
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:37,600
to help us understand the question, who are we? And he's actually quoting Plotinus, a Greek scholar

255
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,880
of the third century. And what Plotinus was asking is the question that we seem to have lost sight of.

256
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,680
And I think he's a damagingly lost sight of, we seem to have lost any idea, the remotest idea

257
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,040
of who we are and what we're doing here. And it's in an effort to help understand that question

258
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:04,160
that I wrote in this book. So it's inevitable that one tries to see the picture in a sense that makes

259
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:12,400
sense as a whole and also makes sense in the context of a human life. What I found is that

260
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:23,600
a lot of people who are specialists in the field of neurology have gravitated to my ideas. But

261
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:31,120
those who work purely in laboratory science in the neurosciences have tended not to. And I think

262
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:38,480
what we see there is that there is no way in which somebody who is a physician or a surgeon who is

263
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:45,600
actually dealing with real people can ignore the blatant evidence that these two parts of the brain

264
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,440
work in different ways and produce different kinds of experience for the individual. Whereas if you

265
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,080
are looking at a technical detail distanced by expensive and elaborate machinery in a laboratory,

266
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,480
you will neither be thinking in terms of where this fits into the whole picture,

267
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,080
nor will you welcome somebody who comes along and says, actually this has human meaning. So that

268
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:20,880
is the conflict I think. But I'm so convinced that there is meaning here. This was apparent to me

269
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,440
20 or 30 years ago and was enough at that stage. I knew very much less than I do now. But I could

270
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:35,520
also already see certain important connections. And it was that that led me to be audacious enough

271
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:43,520
to disregard the kind and very well meant advice of my mentors and older colleagues which was to

272
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,560
not touch this question of hemisphere difference with a barge pole because it would be career

273
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:59,760
destroying. Somehow I have a perverse desire to face certain risks if they seem important and

274
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:06,080
central enough. And I just want to, before I finish on this, I just want to pick up something you've

275
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:13,760
said there which was that I don't suggest that the mind is purely an emanation of the brain. We'll

276
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:22,480
come on to that very much later in other talks, I hope. But what at least one can say is that

277
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,680
the way in which we think our mental world is to some extent shaped by the brain, may not be

278
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:35,920
caused by the brain, but it is nonetheless formed by the brain. It has to come via the brain and

279
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,840
that leaves impression on our senses of work. Lovely. And actually this gets back into your,

280
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:53,360
again, your fine line walking between truth as something that's out there unattainable or something

281
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,800
that doesn't exist and putting in more towards a path to truth. And you are doing the same with

282
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,360
reality, which is what I wanted to ask you next. So you have in the introduction these

283
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:13,440
acronyms for the two views of conceiving reality, reality out there, R-O-T, I don't know if in

284
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,640
English that should be pronounced rot. And then you have the made up miraculously by ourselves,

285
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,920
the mambo version. And of course, again, you are in the virtuous middle. And in particular,

286
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,400
there is this quote of yours, which I would ask you to unpack, which I think can help

287
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,120
at least me because that's something I care a lot to understand. To what extent, as you said,

288
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,200
you're not saying the world is nothing of us, nor it just made up entirely by us.

289
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,360
And you're right. Quote, it is true that we can see the world only partially, but we still

290
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,720
each see the world directly. And I think this is, I think this is very important, especially,

291
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,920
I mean, this is an important problem always, but especially today, where, as you know, there are

292
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:08,880
these types of thinking, both in pop and psychology and science, but also injecting in the real people

293
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:16,080
of the real world, where we're drawn and hammered that the world is just an hallucination that

294
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,720
everything we perceive, it's kind of the matrix all the time. But it's a matrix where even if

295
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,120
you escape from the matrix, you would still doubt that you're still in a simulation again.

296
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:33,200
Now, having somebody right like you, that we see the world directly, which is something,

297
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,440
I believe as well, I think it's a very strong claim. And sometimes can be just

298
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,320
be there and modest in a paragraph. I think it's essential. So if you could also help us

299
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,000
understand your position with, again, with respect to idealism, and in what sense,

300
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,280
we have direct access to the world, which goes back to apprehending and comprehending, I think.

301
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:02,080
And also you emphasize representation or representing versus the world that's presented

302
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:12,160
to us without kind of a second hand dealer that hands it in. Yes. And indeed, even more

303
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:23,360
more striking is if one expresses it using neologism, which has come into philosophical

304
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:29,600
language from the German of Heidegger, the idea of something presencing, which is slightly

305
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:35,200
different from being is present, because his present sounds passive, as though the thing just

306
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,520
is manipulated, whereas presencing is something active. And I believe that the world actively

307
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,880
engages with our consciousness, which is also actively engaging with it. The idea that it's all

308
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,200
a hallucination or a projection on an internal screen is completely understandable, but I think

309
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,040
deeply mistaken. It's completely understandable in this sense. If the left hemisphere, which only

310
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:08,880
sees the representation of the world, were to try and explain what is going on, this is exactly

311
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,720
the picture it will come up with the idea of a homunculus sitting inside the brain, watching a

312
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,840
screen in a chamber that has no windows on the world, and that this is what we take for reality.

313
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:33,120
First of all, I think it would be remarkable if this were the case if there were as much agreement

314
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:40,720
between us as to what is going on in the world as there is. We mustn't emphasize, it's certainly

315
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,000
true that we can be deceived in what we find in the world. And some people see the world in a very

316
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,280
strange way, and this is often the case with people that we talk about as having a mental illness

317
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:59,120
hallucinating. But although that is a reality, the fact is that there is an extraordinary

318
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:10,400
commonality in the ways in which we find the world to be. What I try to explain is that it

319
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,360
is something like the way in which we appreciate a work of art, and perhaps particularly helpful is

320
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:24,000
a piece of music. So take the example of Mozart's G Minor Quintet. This is not something that just

321
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,680
exists in my mind, and it's not just something that exists in Mozart's mind, but it doesn't

322
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:39,680
actually exist on the page in the score either. It exists every time it is played or listened to.

323
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:47,040
It comes into being again in the minds of the players and the listeners. And this gives a rather

324
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,640
good way of understanding what I'm trying to get out, that it's neither something that we just make

325
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,920
up for ourselves miraculously, nor is it something that is out there objectively, and there is a

326
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,280
real G Minor Quintet of Mozart that is the ideal performance, and that's what we're trying to get

327
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,760
at all the time, but failing to do so. Instead I would suggest that there is an encounter,

328
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,880
and that experience is an encounter. I think this is a very, very important idea, and in an

329
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:23,760
encounter there are two elements, the encounterer and the encountered, but they are joined in a way.

330
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:30,080
They're not, again, atomistically separate. They, in this act of encounter, they come together to

331
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:37,920
create something. So, to an extent, it's always been newly created, that quintet, but in essence

332
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,720
it's always recognizably the same thing. We can all talk about it and have very similar

333
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,080
thoughts about it. That's probably the quickest and simplest way which I've ever conveyed. So,

334
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:58,880
what I want to emphasize is that when we see the world, it is only, indeed, an imperfect vision.

335
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,560
That, of course, I agree with, but the difference is not that it's imperfect because it is purely

336
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,480
a representation of something we can never know. It's only imperfect in the sense that it is partial,

337
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:23,280
and I make the comparison with a wonderful Zen garden, Ryoenji, in Japan, in which there are

338
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,760
15 rocks in this Zen garden, but from any one place in the garden, you can only see at the most

339
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,440
14. You can never see the full picture, and our lives are like that. We see parts, but we do

340
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,680
actually see it. What we see is not a hallucination. Yes, thank you. Well, this is very difficult to

341
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,920
unpack in a few minutes, and I'm sure we'll go back to it many times because, well, that has to

342
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:57,040
do with the process-relational view of the universe that I think you and I share, and this is very

343
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:04,080
difficult but also very important to try to spell out. Wonderful. Let me go back because, as you're

344
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:10,160
saying, well, and a smile came out of your face and mind, like when a neuroscientist, let's say,

345
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:20,960
is trying to justify or even claim, demonstrate that the world is nothing but the kind of

346
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,200
hallucination. In doing that, we have this sweet paradox where it's, if we can speak like that,

347
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,880
a hemisphere of the neuroscientist, again, making a claim about the whole of reality. So this brings

348
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:43,600
us back to these two modes and the asymmetry between them and, in a way, the irreversibility

349
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:50,960
in the sense that it seems very difficult, if not impossible, to just, especially the left one,

350
00:40:50,960 --> 00:41:00,960
realizing that the right one has a different view of the world. But you're proposing here an

351
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,920
integration. So in a way, you're writing about both hemispheres and you're giving us all this

352
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:12,720
important detail and analysis. So in a way, you're using one mode, but then you always need to have

353
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,480
the master in its proper place to go back to the title of your previous book. So in a way,

354
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,480
the way, so I'm saying this in order to ask you, what's the way out? Because it seems to me that

355
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,920
if you fall into one mode of thinking, you can make amazing discoveries and say a lot of things,

356
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,120
but in a way, you're not going to get out of it alone, because that's the very nature of being

357
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:43,120
in that mode of thinking and seeing the world. You cannot go from, again, the barge to the

358
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:48,560
whole. You cannot go from all these isms or all these concepts you were enumerating at the beginning.

359
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:55,520
So it feels like a bit of bootstrapping is needed, or like a little miracle, so that when we are

360
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,360
trapped in it, the balance, the proper balance can come back to it. And I know you don't offer

361
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,920
solutions, because that would be perhaps, again, a left-brain way of thinking about it,

362
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,360
but you do offer a view that perhaps can help us see how do we get out of this

363
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,800
hole that we are digging ourselves. And I think that's very important also for civilization,

364
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:27,200
Ridlard. Well, yes, because as you know, in that earlier book, and to an extent in this book,

365
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:36,880
I make a case that our current thinking is dominated by this serial analytic

366
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,840
reductionist process, which is characteristic of the left hemisphere. And then, actually,

367
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,520
many of the great problems that we face, including the destruction of the natural world and the

368
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:56,880
destruction of our own civilization, which are both going on a pace, can be traced to this

369
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,680
way of looking at the world, which I believe is deeply related. Of course, it's not a matter that

370
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,880
is susceptible of proof in its nature. It's not just that I can't prove it. It's that it can't be

371
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:14,800
proven. And one of the first paradoxes is that if you view everything that is in the mind as a

372
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,360
hallucination, then, of course, your view that everything in the mind is a hallucination is

373
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:25,920
also your personal hallucination. And there is no way out of this particular box. But I offer

374
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:37,840
a way from experience in in two respects. One is to take the reader on a journey in part one of

375
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:44,720
the book that I think for anyone who is not actually a neuropsychiatrist or a clinical

376
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:52,080
neuropsychologist will be a remarkable eye opener, and even perhaps for such people. I'm looking at

377
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,480
actually what does happen to human beings when they start to deny purely or mainly on

378
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:05,520
hyponormacy or the right one here alone. And the other way in which I think I can say

379
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:17,840
I offer a pragmatic way of approaching it is that we if we want to evaluate two particular

380
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,960
points of view, one of the ways to do so would be to test it against experience.

381
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:32,480
Suppose I adopt a certain theory about humanity, and I act in that way. Do I find that I'm constantly

382
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,880
surprised, mistaken, or taken aback by the consequences of my doing so? Or do things

383
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:46,560
tend to fit with that vision of the world? And this is a point that has been made in respect of

384
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:54,640
the so-called pragmatist tradition in philosophy, that of C.S. Perse, John Dewey, and William

385
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:03,920
James, for example, in which, and I think a very rich one, in which the ideas of philosophy are not

386
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,920
simply thought about in a very abstract way, which would be a very left hemisphere, a biased way,

387
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:18,480
but tested out on experience. And what I find is that the vision of the world that the right

388
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:29,280
hemisphere offers us makes sense to us and doesn't betray us to the degree that it would be that the

389
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,320
left hemisphere's view of the world would betray us. And one way of thinking about this is like,

390
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,680
suppose you have a couple of banks of instruments and you're flying a plane and you

391
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:45,040
can't actually see, so you're relying very much on the electronics at the moment, and you're told

392
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:51,520
that there isn't enough power to run both of these ways of getting information about where you are,

393
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:00,560
which bank of instruments is more important to you, surely the one that minimizes the

394
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,640
likelihood of your crashing the plane. And what I suggest is that if you adopt the right hemisphere's

395
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:12,000
way of looking at the world, you are not likely to crash the plane. Whereas if you adopt the left

396
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,920
hemisphere's view of the world, you do crash the plane. And in a way, that's what I've just

397
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,360
preferred to, the destruction that's going on all around us as we think about the world in this

398
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,560
deeply fallacious way. Yes. And as the plane is crashing, the left hemisphere would insist

399
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:32,560
of bringing forth their own solutions in order to fix the problem in his thought he's been

400
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,880
causing, right? So again, this is kind of the self-circular nature of the problem.

401
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,320
I might say, so just particularly the way of the left hemisphere, which is self-referential,

402
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,840
because it can't break out as it were into reality. It's dealing all the time with its map,

403
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:57,440
and it's saying, yes, but the map says, and it is left on denial about what is happening. And this

404
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,480
is rather like, experienced this a couple of times, and people tell me about this happening to them,

405
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,280
that they're navigating in a car using a sat-nav and their passenger is saying,

406
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,120
well, the sat-nav says we're there, but you look out at the window, we're not there at all,

407
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,280
we're just in another place, you must not know what the sat-nav says. And that is really the

408
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,320
left hemisphere. It says, well, the sat-nav says it doesn't look out of the window. And it's trying

409
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:26,480
to get people to look out of the window that I'm aiming to do in this book. Exactly. Sorry. No,

410
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,520
it's perfect because this is also a way to summarize. It will be, yes, trust your abstractions,

411
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:41,120
but cherish your own experience, which is a big caveat, both for academics, but also,

412
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:47,920
I don't know, probably the real world people, too, including us, of course. But there is,

413
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:54,320
again, this trend of thinking that insists that, well, we need to doubt, which is a healthy skepticism.

414
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:00,240
Sure. But if we doubt to the point where nothing of what I can experience can bring forth any

415
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,840
any wave on me deciding what's going on in the world, and I just outsource these more and more

416
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:13,600
to abstractions, my abstractions or some abstractions that I borrow, I think we end up in this situation

417
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:20,320
where we are in the middle of nowhere, but the GPS says we arrived at the place and we can find a

418
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:26,480
way to just, well, maybe if I step out of the car and look around, I realize that we've made a mistake

419
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:33,600
and that's fine, we can't correct it. It's fine to correct the mistake. Okay, in wrapping up,

420
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,400
unless you want to add something on this, because I want to start writing, because you're not in a hurry.

421
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:47,440
No, well, what we haven't, of course, endeavored to do and perhaps can't in one go is to paint some

422
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,680
of the differences between the two hemispheres. And as I say, I'm not sure that that can be

423
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:00,640
done just like that now, but one of them that's very relevant is the left hemisphere's capacity

424
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,320
for denial and for false optimism. The left hemisphere, as far as it's concerned, there is

425
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:14,000
never a problem because it's always in control and it's always right. It actually physically will

426
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:22,560
look at a paralyzed limb and say it's not paralyzed. So somebody after a right hemisphere stroke,

427
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:28,480
relying only on their left hemisphere, may have a completely paralyzed left half of the body,

428
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,760
but the functioning left hemisphere will say, but it's functioning fine. Because this is what

429
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:41,040
we're up against. Yes, and I must admit that when I read those chapters, I was literally mind blown

430
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:47,920
and I couldn't believe really what can go wrong with their own minds. And it read like science

431
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,480
fiction, but it wasn't science fiction, it was neurology. And maybe just for our listeners,

432
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,080
because now we're saying, well, the left hemisphere says or things the right. But I promise, I can

433
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:02,640
make a promise because it has been fulfilled for me as I was reading your book, that as we move

434
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:10,320
through the detailed evidence and also its significance, it would be clear this is not just

435
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,680
just, and I maybe shouldn't just say just, but this is not a philosophical position only.

436
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:24,400
This is really what you get exactly as you see what actually happens when the left or the right

437
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:32,160
part of the brain is screwed up. And from here, it's from where you're drawing these statements

438
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:40,240
that it is in denial and so on, which brings us back to the fact that we are trapped and maybe

439
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:47,200
into its ways forward to entrap ourselves, which is where I think the book that you've written

440
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,960
over the last 10 years with nearly 2,000 pages, 1,600 pages and hundreds of references.

441
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,920
Well, I think this is the major contribution beyond science and philosophy. It's to show

442
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,200
a path and it's not just an argument, as you say, in the very first line of the book. It's not just

443
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:14,480
an argument, but it's not just an argument. It's a journey that hopefully while we finish

444
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:20,480
it, or as we are walking through the journey, we may realize that there are these views,

445
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,520
ways of looking that we are not enjoying so much as we could. So maybe this is also to

446
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,560
put it in a more positive note. It's not just a battle between bad ways and good ways, but

447
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:36,960
it's also a joyful journey. I think that's also part of what's going to happen as we go through

448
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,640
the means to truth or the portals to truth, which is part one, and the paths to truth,

449
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,840
which is part two, and part three, and so on, is that we're going to walk through attention,

450
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:55,360
perception, judgment, science, reason, imagination, and consciousness, matter, time, space, the sacred,

451
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:02,240
and it's going to be a joyful trip. And I think that's a good mark that we're doing something

452
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:10,080
good enough or right or true, that there's this joy in reading it. It's not like reading

453
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:16,400
philosophy or science when it is presented as a mathematical theorem. You must obey and

454
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,680
walk through that path, but it's both an argument and an offering, if you allow me to say that.

455
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:28,320
And I think this is fascinating, and I'm grateful that you wrote it in this way.

456
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,760
Well, thanks very much, Alex. I think that is a good point. In a way, what I'm suggesting is that

457
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:41,440
the sort of questions we want to answer are not susceptible of resolution by purely rational

458
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:49,040
argument, not by anyone else's. I do offer arguments as we go through that I hope are

459
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,360
persuasive, but the most persuasive thing, if you're trying to get somebody to see the world

460
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:58,320
a different way, is not just to sit in a seminar room and argue about it, but to go out into the

461
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:05,280
world and have a look. And this is how empirical science works. And it's also how a kind of empirical

462
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:12,480
philosophy works. And what I reckon is that if you accompany me as you have on this trip and look

463
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,280
at the evidence of what happens to human beings when they're forced to rely on one way of thinking

464
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,600
at the expense of another, it demonstrates, I mean, I can't help you if you don't see what I see,

465
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:33,200
and that's fair enough. But for those who want to see, I believe I show that one of these views

466
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:39,840
of the world is more reliable than the other. Importantly, that doesn't mean that the other

467
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:44,720
way of looking, the left hemisphere way of looking is wrong. It's just limited. It's very

468
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:50,640
limited. And it's limited with a purpose in mind to enable us to grab stuff. And that's not nothing.

469
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:57,040
We won't live if we can't eat and build shelter and so on. But that is not the tool whereby we

470
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:04,240
come to understand the world. To do that, we need to bring many strands from experience,

471
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,920
from intuition, from science, from reason together. And people who don't do that actually

472
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:19,600
have a fairly common mental illness. What is remarkable is that schizophrenia is really an

473
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:25,440
example of what happens to people who have to rationalize about everything. They can't start

474
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:31,840
from any bed of experience at all. And it's a point not just made by me, but made by others

475
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:39,360
before me, that when people are schizophrenic, it's not that they have lost their reason,

476
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:44,800
as we say in English, I don't know if one does in Spanish, say that a mad person has lost his

477
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:50,960
reason. It's not just that, but that they have lost everything but their reason and they have to

478
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:57,680
argue for and deduce things, as it were, theoretically, that most of us do intuitively

479
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,720
from a grounding in the real world. How interesting. Yes, you see how language

480
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,800
serves to both show and also conceal, because it's saying the opposite and it's a nice trick.

481
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:14,880
Well, one more thing to add, because you prompted me this thought where you mentioned it's not

482
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:22,400
just about rational argument. And that's where many people become very nervous, right? Because

483
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,480
since a rational argument like this sort of rationality is not just a good instrument,

484
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:35,280
which of course it is, but it's the only instrument allowed. And now when you do these

485
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,760
synthesis, because that's also what you propose, and also these conversions, because it's not just

486
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:46,560
the synthesis from one realm, but the conversions, synthesis, and you make explicit what starts to

487
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:52,480
become difficult, I would guess, to articulate, because the moment you're just talking about

488
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:58,320
what's super-rational or what's not only rational, maybe beyond rational, including it,

489
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,480
but including it, right? That's the beauty of it. It's not rejecting it, of course, including it,

490
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:09,120
and intuition and imagination. I think, Ian, what you're doing is you're going, if I may say so,

491
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:15,600
and many people may not feel comfortable with this either, but it's like going a bit forward in human

492
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:23,680
evolution. It's like, well, as a species and our human mind has excelled, no doubt, with reason and

493
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:30,800
with many other abilities, you may say, but the moment we start to talk more openly and precisely

494
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,960
and accurately about imagination and intuition, I think we're in a new path. Well, it's a well

495
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,240
floating path, but it's a good path, because we're making progress. We are not always all around

496
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:50,240
congratulating ourselves as to how enlightened we could be, but we are also acknowledging that there

497
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:56,960
is something else, and perhaps that's also why you have this amazing book, sorry, you know,

498
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,520
book. It's a chapter, but that's something that happens with your chapters, that they could all

499
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:08,240
be books by themselves, where you talk about consciousness, which is one of my favorite

500
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:14,400
chapters, but also the sacred at the very end. So here we have somebody that's very knowledgeable

501
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:22,640
in neurology and physics and philosophy, and at the end is writing about the sacred, and they should

502
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:32,000
not scare academics or real world people, and they should excite or at least make them feel

503
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:39,360
grateful for a chapter on the sacred, right? But you see how we are not just walking the fine line,

504
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:44,560
as I was telling you before, but also getting into a point where it's a kind of an edge,

505
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:52,640
there's this mist, and you start not to see the accuracy of the data of mathematical

506
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:58,480
theorem demonstration, but you're in this place where, to be honest, this is where I think we

507
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,440
we need to go, and we should not be scared, I think we should be enjoyed, and you're going

508
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:12,080
into that place, and I think that's also remarkable. Yes, thank you. Well, what I wanted in this book

509
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:22,000
was to show the confluence that I see between findings in neurology, trends in the last 100

510
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:29,600
years in philosophy, and findings in physics. I'm not a physicist, Alex, as you are, but I do,

511
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,240
I have, rather to my surprise, I found myself being approached by quite a number of physicists who'd

512
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:42,000
read the master and his emissary and said this is incredibly relevant to what we are dealing with,

513
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,000
and so I do have people that I can try out my ideas on before I write them, but in any case,

514
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:55,600
the point is that these, apparently, to our way of thinking, quite distinct paths of neuropsychology,

515
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:00,560
data philosophy, and data physics come together, and it's like starting from

516
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,120
points on the circumference of a circle and going inwards and coming together, and what is also

517
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:14,320
interesting to me is that the picture that coheres there is also recognizable in the great

518
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:22,240
ancient traditions of philosophy around the world. It agrees with the findings of ancient wisdom

519
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:29,920
traditions, hence the idea that we can just not say anything about the idea of value, like goodness,

520
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,800
beauty, truth, all of the sacred, you know, scientists and philosophers better keep off

521
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:40,240
those things. I mean, that is not the way it is for me, and what I hope is that people might start

522
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:46,160
out this book, I don't know, some of them, rather thinking, well, he's got a difficult

523
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,640
furrow to plow, if he's going to convince me that it's worth talking about these subjects,

524
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,680
but I hope that after following me through the book, if they have the patience and courage to do so,

525
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:02,320
they will find that it's absolutely essential and that, in a way, only somebody who was rather

526
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:08,640
blinkered would think, no, you can't bring these into the picture, they are at the core of the picture.

527
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,120
Yes, indeed. So, you know, we are there in the car, the GPS, we're not sure if it's working,

528
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:19,600
we can look through the window and we can ask the indigenous people around, and if now the GPS

529
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:26,320
and your site and your own orientation and what the locals tell you seems to start converging,

530
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:33,360
this is a good sign that we are approaching the place we want to get at, even though we will never

531
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,040
really get at it, but in this process, we're getting closer.

532
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,080
I love that, that's a very nice way of putting it, thank you.

533
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:53,120
Well, just for me to add, I hope this suffix is a good enough invitation for anyone to read your

534
01:00:53,120 --> 01:01:06,640
book and we will continue, hopefully, unpacking it, enjoying it. Again, for me, it's an honor to

535
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:12,880
do so with you. Well, it is a hugely important experience for me to have somebody with your

536
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:19,760
breadth of background responding so positively to it, and I hope that we will actually make this

537
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:26,160
journey together and bring some listeners and viewers with us on that path. Great, so let's

538
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:33,840
leave it at that, thank you. All right, goodbye for now then, Alex. Yes, see you soon. Until next time.
