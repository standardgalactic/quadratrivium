1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,800
Okay, so I feel like I am the luckiest and happiest corpus callosum, separating and

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,600
reaching these two gentlemen, Ima Gilchrist and Rupert Sheldrake. I've had the honor

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,560
and pleasure to spend many hours in conversation with you two, and we're here at Rupert's

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,560
house because we've recorded a series of conversations with Rupert and also with Iain. The last

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,680
one covering his book The Matter With Things, and so we couldn't miss this opportunity to

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,800
be the three of us, and especially you two in conversation, so I'm really glad we're

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:51,080
doing this. So am I. Me too. So let's start with any curiosity back and forth, maybe

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,320
from Rupert about the hemisphere apothesis, and perhaps from me and Rupert about morphic

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,440
resonance, and then see where we go. All right. Well, I confess I haven't read the whole of

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,200
your book, but I've read several chats of it, and I've watched many of your talks and

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,640
so on, and one thing I deduced is that it's something to do with the two hemispheres of

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:22,000
the brain. That has come through quite loud and clear in every chapter, and there are

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,840
two things I'm curious about, about the hemispheres and your chosen central terrain. One is that

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,400
when people started doing these split brain operations, they were done, I think for epileptics

15
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,160
mainly, weren't they? They severed the corpus callosum that joins the two halves of the

16
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:50,160
brain together, and this enabled Sperry and other scientists to look at the lateralization

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,560
of function in the two hemispheres, and they had to do very sophisticated experiments to

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,280
show this, that all that leads to this idea of differentiated function. But the bit that

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:10,680
interests me is that they were doing these operations on patients who had their brain

20
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,320
split in two, or at least all down to, there were still a few connections in the basal

21
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,200
brain, but largely severed the connections between them, and the reason they were able

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,640
to do this and go on doing it was because when people went home, it seemed to have solved

23
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,920
the seizure problem, and they seemed perfectly normal. And for me, that's the most astonishing

24
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,640
thing of all in this research, that people who had had their brain completely cut in

25
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,240
two, not completely, but largely cut in two, worked to coordinate the movements of both

26
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:51,000
sides of their body, their mouth moved, coordinated as they spoke, their spouses and loved ones

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,120
hardly noticed any difference. And for me, that suggests either that the nervous connections

28
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:06,200
to the two halves of the brain are completely or largely unnecessary, which is very surprising,

29
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,440
or that the coordination between the two halves of the brain, which must be there in order

30
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,040
to walk and speak and swim and dance and do all the normal movements of life. I'm just

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,280
talking about motor coordination here, not just about, you know, the more sophisticated

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,720
cognitive functions, that then there must be still some coordination to the two halves

33
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,680
of the brain. And for me, that suggests there's a kind of resonance between the two halves

34
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,680
of the brain resonate, either electromagnetically or through something like morphic resonance,

35
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,880
that there's an overall wholeness within which these two parts are coordinated by resonance.

36
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,880
They're not coordinated by direct nervous connections, as one might otherwise have assumed.

37
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,520
So for me, it raises a completely different view of how the brain may actually work and

38
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,520
how the two hemispheres may be coordinated. What would you think about that? I mean, why

39
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,760
is it that severing the connection of corpus callosum that links the two halves has so

40
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,640
little manifest effect?

41
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,800
The first thing to say is that the corpus callosum, many people don't realize, is a

42
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:24,480
mammalian invention. So although reptiles, amphibians, and many other creatures lower

43
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:33,480
down that tree have two centers in their brain, they're not connected in this direct way.

44
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,840
Corpus callosum started with the first mammals. The second thing I think that's worth reflecting

45
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,800
on is that it's not uncommon for people to be born with what's called colossal age

46
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,240
genesis, in other words, they don't have a corpus callosum, and it's often a chance

47
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:58,240
finding a postmortem. So quite clearly, the finding that you can sever the connection

48
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:06,680
and people can lead a reasonably normal life, almost impossible really to, if casually encountered,

49
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,520
you wouldn't notice that there was a problem. These are consonant findings and they are

50
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:21,920
a bit mysterious, I agree. But what they think they show is that, first of all, this direct

51
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,600
connection between the hemispheres is not the only way in which the two hemispheres can

52
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,360
communicate. For example, they very obviously share a body and the eyes and the senses take

53
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,680
in both parts of the body, so they know where, if you like, they can sense outwardly as well

54
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:48,240
as inwardly what's going on. Mostly in these cases, the operation was done in somebody who

55
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,880
had a longish life and had got used to the coordination of the two hemispheres. They

56
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,680
communicate with one another through the endocrine system. There are all sorts of ways in which

57
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:08,880
they have a common internal environment. And as you say, they communicate at the level

58
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,280
of the brainstem and even a little bit above it. So there is definitely connection there

59
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:23,560
of a kind. I don't know quite how to understand the resonance though, because the immediate

60
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,880
question is, I mean, when you think of things resonating, you think the brain waves from

61
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,400
this hemisphere are they literally resonating with the other hemisphere? I don't know of

62
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,960
any evidence of that. So what sort of a resonance exactly is it that they might have?

63
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:46,280
Well, I'm not sure, but what I think of it, say that there was a field, a morphic field

64
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,640
covering the whole brain and brain activity, that included within it the activity of the

65
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,280
two hemispheres, then the way in which they're coordinated might be through this field,

66
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,520
co-ordinating the two parts within a larger hole. And the coordination wouldn't necessarily

67
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,520
mean that one echoes the other in a most literal resonance way. But the way in which, say, the

68
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,520
different organs of the body, or say, different atoms within a molecule are coordinated within

69
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:24,520
a larger field. Now, if you take a molecule, a very simple molecule like H2O or CO2, the

70
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:32,200
atoms, the carbon and the two oxygens in carbon dioxide, are bound together by bonds. But

71
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,240
the bonds that bind them together have an electron cloud that goes around the whole molecule.

72
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Covalently bonded molecules have a cloud of electrons surrounding the whole molecule,

73
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,760
like a membrane around the whole molecule. And the bond between the actual individual

74
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:53,280
atoms is there are shared electrons that bond them. But there's a cloud, an electron cloud,

75
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,440
around the whole thing. And the vibratory patterns of carbon and oxygen within a CO2,

76
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,800
they have different vibratory patterns, but they're coordinated together by an overall

77
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,800
field which influences both through its influence on their vibratory frequencies and coordinates

78
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,480
them and is sensitive to changes in both in a way that communicates it to the other.

79
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,560
Something like that. I mean, this is a crude model and I haven't actually tried to work

80
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,640
it out in detail. But some overarching field of whatever kind, I mean, my favorite kind

81
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:35,640
of morphic fields, but some overarching, organizing field in which both are parts and which coordinates

82
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,640
the two, would seem to me to be one way of thinking about this.

83
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,560
Well, immediately, of course, I think of the way in which quantum field theory suggests

84
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,560
that the way we tend to think in terms of little balls or particles is at most of metaphorical

85
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,160
meaning. And that what is being referred to there is a very particular state of something

86
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:08,160
that is an overall field that has energy and exerts influence. So such fields are very

87
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,440
basic. And without the idea that there is some sort of coordinating field, it's difficult

88
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,320
to explain how a simple organism, a single cell organism, can detect changes and respond

89
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,320
to them in other parts of even that cell. I mean, this is something that has been puzzled

90
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,920
over by many biologists. And there seems to be some overall coordination. And of course

91
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,880
this goes much further when you come to a multicellular organism and how do the various parts of this

92
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,560
organism know that certain things need to be responded to elsewhere in the organism?

93
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,400
Look, we don't at the moment have any way of understanding how this communication takes

94
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:01,400
place. Yes. You see, I think it even applies to physical systems like crystals. I mean,

95
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,000
there's a longstanding problem, as you know, with snowflakes. You know, Johannes Kepler

96
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,360
wrote a monograph on the six-sided snowflake. I didn't actually know. He did. Yes, he was

97
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,600
fascinated by snowflakes. All these people have taken wonderful pictures of snowflakes.

98
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,120
You know, Bentley is one of the great ones, the classic pictures. What you see with the

99
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,360
snowflake is they all have six sides or arms. And the six arms are the same as each other.

100
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,640
But each snowflake is different. Exactly. So the thing is, how come they're coordinated?

101
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,160
Because you could say, well, the particular branches on the thing are random to do with

102
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,480
the immediate environment. But then you'd have to say to explain the whole snowflake

103
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,920
being the same. The every arm of the growing snowflake was exactly the same on that snowflake.

104
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,440
And they're all the same just because they were in exactly the same fluctuating environment,

105
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,800
fluctuating in the same way. And the next snowflake was in a completely different environment.

106
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Or you could say, as intriguingly the late editor of Nature, Sir John Maddox, no friend

107
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,120
of mine in many ways, puzzling over this question of snowflakes, said there must be some kind

108
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,120
of internal resonance within the lattice structure of the snowflake that enables it to be co-ordinated.

109
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:28,120
It must be reading you. Possibly. But you see, there are resonances within crystal lattices,

110
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:37,040
there are resonant patterns and harmonics and stuff. And so say there's a co-ordination

111
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,160
between these seemingly separate arms of the snowflake, which could depend on some kind

112
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,520
of field that's over and above the individual arms. So that's the kind of model. And one

113
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:55,520
would expect with any holistic model of organisms that there's a field for the entire body that

114
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,200
helps coordinate the development of the body and all the organs within it. But this field

115
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:08,200
also helps coordinate development of different parts. So for example, when the fingerprint

116
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,160
patterns are similar on right and left hands, and when the right and left hand side of the

117
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,840
faces are similar, they're not exactly the same, of course. But I think in normal morphogenesis

118
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,200
there's a kind of right-left resonance going on all the time, which helps coordinate bilaterally

119
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,920
symmetrical structures. Now, of course, the brain's not exactly bilaterally symmetrical

120
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,920
as one of the points that we know from its anatomy as well as its function. But some

121
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,920
overarching field that enables this to happen. That to me is why one reason I myself got

122
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,160
interested in split brains in a sense, the opposite from your own interest, which is

123
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,400
about the differences. And I was just interested in how come the co-ordination is still so

124
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,640
remarkable and so integrated that we don't experience two, most people don't experience

125
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,520
two sub-personalities all the time. And the idea of a co-ordinating field that includes

126
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:13,520
both and co-ordinates both would help to explain why we don't go around with right-hand

127
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,200
Rupert and left-hand Rupert, one with a wonderfully integrated view of the world and the other

128
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,240
with a kind of obsessive literal one.

129
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Is your question perhaps rephrased by saying, is there an organizing principle that unites

130
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,280
the master and his emissary? Or can the master do it on its own?

131
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,640
No, I think one way of thinking about what you're talking about is that just as in the

132
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,280
developing organism there needs to be differentiation, say that on one side of the body there'll

133
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,360
be a liver on the other, you know, spleen and so on. These things are also part of a single

134
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,120
overarching field, if you like. And the brain could be seen as similarly asymmetrical, but

135
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,720
part of that asymmetry is already part of a single field. I think you must have been

136
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,480
reading McGilchrist, actually, because of course I have wonderful images of snowflakes, actually,

137
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:21,480
and talk about exactly this issue, which also occurs in deer antlers, for example.

138
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,040
Deer antlers have a particular form peculiar to that deer. If you cut them off, they regenerate

139
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,040
exactly according to that pattern, but where this pattern is stored is not known. So overall

140
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,800
we have problems that are generally neglected because they're difficult to answer, but as

141
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,080
soon as you start thinking about it in a more inquiring way, which I would have thought

142
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,280
was the point of science, that's a difficult question. How is it that these things have

143
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:57,280
this overall confusion? I mean, no, for example, in the brain, I forget the exact figure, but

144
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,660
it's something staggering, like 500,000 neurons are generated every minute in the business

145
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:11,700
of gestation in the womb, and all those neurons have to end up precisely in the right place

146
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:18,420
in the brain, and the brain has minute architectural... Where exactly is this information stored

147
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:25,420
about the three-dimensional structure alone of the brain? I don't think it can be even

148
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:32,420
encoded in simple linear code in the sense that we think of code. Of course, we've now

149
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,780
dropped the idea that it's a taller linear code in the way the computer is coded, but

150
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,780
instead must be a three-dimensional code, and so we know about the conformation in epigenetics

151
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:48,780
of the genes involved. But nonetheless, where is this... You don't see anywhere in that

152
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:57,300
this intricate three-dimensional structure stored, and the simplest thing I can imagine

153
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:04,100
is that there is some overarching field. Can I just add a couple of other amusing or interesting

154
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:11,100
things? I mean, one is the striking fact that people who are born without limbs nonetheless

155
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,660
have the sense of the limbs. They've never had them, but nonetheless, they have an internal

156
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:23,660
sense of those limbs, and Ramachandra describes a woman who had no limbs, no upper limbs,

157
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,660
having phantom limbs, which she couldn't stop gesticulating when she talked. So this

158
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:37,660
part of evolutionary history, the hand movements are coordinated with speech, was there in

159
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,340
her, although she had never experienced hands or arms. The other thing, which is raised

160
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:49,340
by F. S. Schiller, the Victorian philosopher, Oxford philosopher, which is a very good

161
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:55,340
point, is we know, of course, that when people have damage to one part of the brain, other

162
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:01,340
parts of the brain can take over the function. But how is this coordinated? How does one

163
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:07,340
part of the brain that's supposedly doing whatever it does know we need speech? How

164
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:13,340
are we going to get it back? I mean, in a way, there's a need for something overarching

165
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:20,340
to draw out that function in a new place in the brain.

166
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:26,340
Well, of course, my own starting point for my ideas on morphogenetic resonance was morphogenetic

167
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:31,340
fields, form-shaping fields. And I started my scientific career working on plant development.

168
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
Yes.

169
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:39,340
And how is it that leaves and flowers and stem ends and so on develop? And the idea of morphogenetic

170
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:47,340
fields, first put forward in the 1920s, was exactly that of a coordinating field that

171
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,340
brings forth these patterns, and underlies regeneration. And so, for example, in the

172
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:04,340
regeneration of salamander eyes, so-called wolfian regeneration, you cut out the lens

173
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:10,340
of the eye of a new torus salamander, and it will regenerate new lens from the edge of

174
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,340
the iris, which is not how the lens forms in the embryo, it forms by folding in the skin

175
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:22,340
from the outside. So there's a completely filling and missing structure by modifying

176
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:29,340
some other structure would never normally be modified to create, to fill that function.

177
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:37,340
And all this similar kind of coordination applies in social insects. If you remove some

178
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,340
of the workers, or remove some of the soldiers, or remove some of the hive, or something. The

179
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,340
whole system re-adjusts, they stop doing what they're doing, some of them take on different

180
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:55,340
functions and roles. So these coordinating fields, I think, underlie all of biology,

181
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:02,340
all of nature of self-organizing systems. And phantom limbs are particularly interesting

182
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:08,340
because I think in a phantom limb, the phantom is the field of the limb which is experienced

183
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,340
from within, but which doesn't have a material structure associated with it. And as you may

184
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:20,340
know, one of the experiments that I proposed in my book Seven Experiments That Could Change

185
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,340
the World is on detecting phantom limbs. I recruit amputees through veterans' organizations,

186
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:33,340
tried recruiting them through hospitals, but they were extremely uncooperative. And then

187
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:40,340
I have the phantom amputee, but they push their phantom arm through one of six positions

188
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:48,340
in a barrier, a door, for example. And on the other side, that's done in a randomized sequence,

189
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:54,340
on the other side, I have people who do subtle energy medicine, Reiki, Helos, and so on. And

190
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,340
one at a time, I lead them in, I say, one of those panels has a phantom arm sticking through

191
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,340
it, and the others don't, which has got the phantom, and they sort of feel in different

192
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:10,340
places. And they say that one, and they write more than chance so far, substantially more

193
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,340
than chance. So the main objection I've had to this is, well, how do you know it's not

194
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:22,340
telepathy? If we've moved, if the skeptic of the argument says, it must be telepathy,

195
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,340
and we've moved it. That's beautiful. Yes, yes. But then, as a test for that, I haven't

196
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,340
done this yet, but the control, the telepathy control is you ask them to imagine pushing

197
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,340
their phantom arm through, or you ask them to extend their phantom arm with a step back

198
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,340
yard or two to start with and extend it so it doesn't actually go through the door.

199
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:49,340
And so that would be another control. Now, these experiments are not expensive. In fact,

200
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:56,340
they're free. So I think that actually this whole question can be taken much further. This

201
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:05,340
is not the kind of thing people do in labs at the moment, but they could. But before

202
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:13,340
we leave the subject of the divided brain and all that, I have a more, probably a simpler

203
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:21,340
easy to answer question. You could probably refer me to page 3027 in your Magnum Office,

204
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:30,340
which is, I'm a pianist, and so obviously playing the piano involves coordinating the

205
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:36,340
right and the left hand. And the left hand, which mainly does the rhythmic section as

206
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,340
well, is clearly controlled by the right brain. And the right hand, which does the sort of

207
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:49,340
melody and all the rest is by the left brain. And in playing the piano, these are coordinated.

208
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,340
And how does this map on to your interpretation? I'm sure it maps wonderfully well, but I just

209
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,340
love to know how. Well, one of the mysteries is that music is abnormally lateralized in

210
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:08,340
the brain of performers. So in the general population who are not professional musicians

211
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:16,340
or full-time musicians, the only bit of music that is really understood or interpreted by

212
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:25,340
the left hemisphere is rhythm. And melody and harmony are almost exclusively understood

213
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:31,340
and experienced in the right hemisphere. So that seems on the face of it very different

214
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:39,340
from what you're describing. And one of the things is that for most instruments, the two

215
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,340
hands need to be coordinated for all these activities. And so when you look at professional

216
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:50,340
musicians, what I've just described is not the case. So they have developed a left hemisphere

217
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:56,340
which is also capable of understanding melody and harmony. And the right hemisphere already

218
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:02,340
actually understands rhythm anyway. In fact, complex rhythms in the ordinary person are

219
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,340
understood by the right hemisphere, not by the left. It's only simple rhythms the left

220
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:12,340
can get. The sort of thing that I constantly hear everywhere I go, blaring out of cars

221
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:17,340
on speakers in shops and so on, which is just boom, boom, boom. That is the left hemisphere

222
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:24,340
speaking. But I think what you're describing is an effortful coordination which actually

223
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,340
modifies the brain. I see. Because you see, I thought on the basic, I mean my understanding

224
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:37,340
of McGillchrist 101 was that actually the right and left hand should be reversed. And there's

225
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,340
no reason why when the development of piano playing took place, the keyboards shouldn't

226
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:47,340
have been the other way round. With the deep notes at the top. Yes. Well, yes, with the

227
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,340
keyboard reversed. So you play with the left hemisphere, the right hand would do the rhythm

228
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,340
and the left hand would do, I mean it could have been exactly the mirror image of the

229
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,340
way it is now. There's nothing in the technology that says it has to be that way round. It's

230
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:09,340
quite right. I never really thought about that. I think that you'd have to have had,

231
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:17,340
not just a reversal of, you'd have to have had the higher notes on the left hands part

232
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,340
of the scale. Yes. That's right. The thing is that in the brain there are certain things

233
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:30,340
that are positionally, it seems like, for example, the sequence from left to right in which things

234
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:39,340
grow is innate in, for example, chicks. They tend to see that a series of numbers grows

235
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,340
as you move towards the right, which is the way in which we see from one to itself. And

236
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:50,340
so we start from lower to higher. And it may be that this is also the way in which it seems

237
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:58,340
fundamentally that the lower notes are basic. They are the base. And the other is what is

238
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:04,340
built more complexly on top of it. And so it may be natural that an instrument developed

239
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,340
in this way. But I haven't studied all instruments around the world to see whether or not there's

240
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,340
a project for somebody with nothing else to do. Well, look at Islamic music, you see,

241
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,340
because they read from right to left. Yes. And so their whole sense of the way things

242
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,340
develop. Yes. You start at the back of the book by our criteria and you read from right

243
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,340
to left. It's the exact opposite. Of course. If pianos had first been developed in the

244
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Caliphate, in Baghdad or somewhere, perhaps the upper part of the keyboard would have been

245
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:42,340
the lower notes and the rhythm section, and it might have been a mirror image of existing pianos.

246
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,340
It's a hypothetical, but some research, anthropological search, would be interesting.

247
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,340
Yes. I don't know why it's ended up that way in brief, but that is the way it is. And

248
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:59,340
it's also true, of course, of all instruments. I don't know of any instruments that are just

249
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,340
played with one hand. I mean, it's one of the things we do, even with sort of playing a flute,

250
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,340
playing a violin. Both hands have to be coordinated, at least in Western music, that is,

251
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:16,340
almost as I think we know. So the hands have to work together in this way, and the brain

252
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,340
is modified in those who do it, so that it can. I wonder how much learning the piano,

253
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:27,340
you see, I started learning piano when I was five. I come from a musical family. And my son,

254
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:33,340
Merlin, learned at five, Cosmo, who started learning at four. And that means from a very early

255
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:40,340
age, they and lots and lots of other people have actually been using brains in a way that

256
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:49,340
would be somewhat counterintuitive if they read McGillchrist first. So does this affect

257
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,340
the actual development? Do people who learn the piano or other instruments at an early

258
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:00,340
age develop differently? I mean, professional musicians, you said, are noticeably different.

259
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,340
But what about amateur musicians who play every day?

260
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:08,340
Well, of course, the distinction is not between amateur and professional, but between people

261
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,340
who are constantly playing and those who are only occasionally playing. So I don't think

262
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:20,340
there's a problem with that. But I would imagine that starting early to learn an instrument

263
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:26,340
like this will modify, certainly we know in respect of the appreciation of sound that

264
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:31,340
it does modify the brain. And I don't see why it should not modify the brain in other

265
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:37,340
ways. You and your two sons have interesting brains that work perhaps slightly different

266
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:47,340
from the standard Western brain. Yes. Yes. Well, that's a really interesting possibility,

267
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:54,340
isn't it? I don't know if anybody has done more tests on professional pianists or, you

268
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,340
know, I don't know of any. No. Well, it would be a good research area from the point of view

269
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,340
of brain naturalization, wouldn't it? Absolutely. When I have seen reports saying the people

270
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:10,340
who learn the piano or other instruments have a different way in which they think and stuff.

271
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:16,340
Okay. But it would be an obvious thing to do because this involves a close coordination

272
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:23,340
of the two hemispheres in a way that, I mean, we need it in every physical activity, walking,

273
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,340
running, jumping, sports skills, presumably, you know, playing cricket, playing football,

274
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:34,340
etc., right and left feet. Presumably all these physical skills involve coordination

275
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,340
of hemispheres. Well, they do, but the difference is that the left hemisphere and the right

276
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:45,340
hemisphere and motor performance each control the other. And there's not the, you know,

277
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:50,340
there's the distinction that there is between melody, harmony and rhythm, if you see what

278
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:57,340
I mean. Yes. So music introduces a whole different aspect. Yes. There's no reason to suppose

279
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:03,340
that we should be discoordinated when we move. And then animals that have no corpus callosum

280
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:09,340
are perfectly well coordinated. You know, this question of yours could be scaled up to

281
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:16,340
in asking how could we nurture young brains so that they have an easier time to grasp the

282
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:22,340
world as you've proposed in your book or another way to put it would be how to nurture the

283
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Ruperts and eons of the future, which is something I'm very concerned with. What can we do to

284
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:34,340
facilitate those intuitions that you both have been pursuing in different ways, but

285
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:42,340
scientifically and beyond? You know, if you have some thoughts on that. Well, one thought

286
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:49,340
I have that seems relevant is that I think that to the extent that what you're asking

287
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:58,340
for is people who think more flexibly. There is a problem with dogma in both in philosophy

288
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:06,340
and in science. It's a natural tendency for things to ossify, to fix prematurely and not

289
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:14,340
allow evolution. It's natural for thought to evolve. And to do this, it has to be creative.

290
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:29,340
And the best kinds of thinking that will allow this are those in which analytic acumen is

291
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:35,340
there, but coupled with rather like the left and the right hand, coupled with a more imaginative

292
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:43,340
and intuitive way of thinking. And I describe the insights of many scientists and mathematicians

293
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:49,340
and it's quite extraordinary how virtually all of them describe this so-called ah-ha

294
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:57,340
moment as being the creative thing that reveals the new Gestalt. And this ah-ha moment is

295
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:03,340
robustly associated with the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus of the right hemisphere.

296
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:08,340
So we know that this is right hemisphere, mediate it. And the trouble with our education now

297
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,340
is that it's very much technically orientated. More and more we're saying what's the point

298
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,340
in teaching people unless it's teaching them some mechanical skill that will be useful to them.

299
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:26,340
But in fact, the point of an education is to draw out of us our humanity. And humanity used to be

300
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:34,340
part of what we discussed in school, the humanities. And I think that a greater emphasis on music,

301
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:40,340
on poetry, which also involves very largely the right hemisphere, whereas ordinary

302
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:46,340
discursive language is probably more dependent on the left hemisphere than on both.

303
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:54,340
These ways of thinking should be part of the way we educate children. What do you say, Rupert?

304
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:02,340
Yes. Well, I think there are some forms of education like sports, physical skills,

305
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:08,340
crafts, which are part of education. I mean, they're always being squeezed out by the senses

306
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:17,340
on more science, more literacy, more language, more learning. I think training other skills

307
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:24,340
like intuitive abilities and emotional intelligence, all these things, they seem to be really important.

308
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:30,340
But we've got a system of education which is designed for, well, basically it follows

309
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:37,340
from Victorian design, doesn't it, of preparing people for life in an industrial society.

310
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:42,340
One thing is to make children used to getting up and showing up for school at nine o'clock

311
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:47,340
in the morning and fixed hours, I mean, which you need in an industrial society,

312
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:53,340
disciplining from an early age. And I think a lot of it's about that.

313
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,340
I think that's very important myself.

314
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,340
It's important, but it's not primarily about creativity.

315
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,340
Obviously so.

316
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:09,340
Actually, for most people, I don't think creativity is, I don't think we necessarily need to have creativity

317
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:14,340
built into the entire educational system because it's a major disadvantage.

318
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:19,340
It's a disadvantage for a lot of people to be creative. I mean, if you've got a regular job

319
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:25,340
and you're creative, you're going to have an awfully difficult time.

320
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Most jobs require lack of creativity.

321
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,340
Yes.

322
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:37,340
And, you know, I went into the scientific career believing that the importance of scientists

323
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:44,340
be original and creative. And I soon discovered there was every obstacle to doing that.

324
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:55,340
You know, whenever I'm trying to be or am being or, you know, doing something that seems to me original and creative,

325
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,340
instead of people saying how wonderful, I mean, the vast majority of people say rubbish, nonsense,

326
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:06,340
where's the evidence, etc. And if you have the evidence and you do an experiment you think is creative,

327
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,340
you say, well, you've got these results, but where's the theory?

328
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:22,340
You know, and as Alex sometimes says, you know, one of the responses I get to my research on telepathy

329
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,340
and things like that is, you know, it's all very well in practice, but does it work in theory?

330
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,340
Yes, it does.

331
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,340
So actually originality is a major disadvantage for a lot of people.

332
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:38,340
Well, it may be, but it depends what we mean by an education.

333
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:44,340
If we mean simply preparing people for routine jobs, then we're limiting their potential

334
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,340
and we're prescribing what is valued in society.

335
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:56,340
Whereas if we were to encourage some people, definitely need their originality enhancing

336
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,340
or not even enhancing but liberating, I think it's there in a lot of people.

337
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,340
But it does need disciplining as well. This is why I see that both parts are important.

338
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:11,340
I think that modern education both lacks discipline and lacks originality.

339
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:17,340
It's about sticking information into people inefficiently and then hoping they can regurgitate it later.

340
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,340
But that's not an education at all.

341
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,340
An education is about enabling something that is innate to grow.

342
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:30,340
But that growth also, if you like, needs a formal field in which to grow.

343
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,340
And that should be provided by good teachers and was, I hope for you and certainly was for me,

344
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:45,340
by highly disciplined, intellectually acute, but also imaginatively inspired teachers from whom I learned.

345
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,340
You know, this was extraordinarily important.

346
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,340
Now, I was very lucky too with my teachers at school and at university.

347
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,340
But I mean, what I want to emphasize is it's not about letting it all hang out.

348
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,340
I mean, there was an enormous amount of discipline.

349
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,340
You know, at an early age, one had to know trigonometry and calculus.

350
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,340
One had to be able to understand Greek grammar and Latin grammar, all these things.

351
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,340
And these are difficult.

352
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,340
I mean, there are all things that you get by sort of going, oh, well, whatever.

353
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,340
I mean, they really require serious application.

354
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,340
And one does need that structure.

355
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:23,340
And I believe that in learning a skill, and you talked about that,

356
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,340
and you're talking about manual skills largely.

357
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
I think they're very important crafts and skills.

358
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,340
But to begin with, you have to do rather laborious copying of things.

359
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:36,340
But then you're in the position to be able to go further than that.

360
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,340
But you need that first element to be there before you can go further.

361
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:44,340
I mean, I didn't write this book out of not knowing anything about neuroscience or, you know,

362
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,340
years of hard work involved.

363
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,340
And your work, it also involves years of hard work, I know.

364
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,340
It's that commute from right to left to right that you mentioned, right?

365
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,340
Yes, it needs to go from right to left and back to right.

366
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:03,340
By which I mean that one's first apprehension of something is a perceptive and imaginative understanding.

367
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,340
And then one needs to, as we learn more, by the process of analysis

368
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,340
and seeing the structure of what one's doing

369
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,340
and making comparisons and putting things together in a certain way.

370
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,340
But they must never stop there.

371
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,340
That is an intermediary phase.

372
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:25,340
And then it needs to be reintegrated into a new whole in which that laborious analysis has been not lost

373
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,340
because that suggests that it was pointless, but it had its point at a certain period in time.

374
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:34,340
What your discussion reminds me of the simple organisms I used to study,

375
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,340
E. coli, how they navigate the world.

376
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,340
It's like learning to tumble and learning to run.

377
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
They need to run and tumble.

378
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:46,340
So in a way, a certain dose of dogmatism is needed to just keep on going for some while

379
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,340
because it would stop at every point.

380
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,340
To reconceive that you would get nowhere.

381
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,340
But if you don't stop and tumble, then you also go nowhere.

382
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
So it's this balance in a way.

383
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
It's very interesting.

384
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:04,340
And of course science needs to balance its openness to change and newness

385
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:09,340
and its willingness to stick to certain things unless there's a good reason for moving on.

386
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,340
Otherwise it would be changing its mind about everything all the time.

387
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:17,340
So everything in life is a matter of balancing things

388
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:23,340
and coming to a position which honours and respects and enhances by integrating

389
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,340
the two things that we think are separate in some way, but they're not really separate.

390
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,340
I agree.

391
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,340
Now let's not make of your particular biographies as a friend of mine says,

392
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,340
a universal category, but I'd like to hear a bit about your own paths

393
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:45,340
because it's clear that you've gone through the margins or the edge.

394
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,340
You could even say cutting edge.

395
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,340
You haven't followed the prescribed path.

396
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,340
At your risk, you've succeeded.

397
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,340
That's why maybe we don't have your other people who didn't make it,

398
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,340
but you've made it and in a way your paths are similar in that respect.

399
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:06,340
And what does that tell us as a model or what it doesn't tell us as a model for other people?

400
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:10,340
Well, I suppose we're both feral academics

401
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:15,340
and we were both fellows of colleges in Oxford, me at Cambridge

402
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:23,340
and we somehow escaped from domestication and lived in the wild.

403
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,340
As much in the wild as you.

404
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:31,340
I mean, you were treated to the fastnesses of the Western Isles.

405
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:35,340
I'm merely on the edge of Hampstead Heath.

406
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,340
But I find, I don't know if you do, that very often now,

407
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,340
and I didn't think this was always the case, but very often now,

408
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:52,340
the really interesting ideas are coming forth from places that are not in the middle of the mainstream.

409
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:57,340
They're coming from people who are working on their own or working in small groups

410
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,340
and these are producing highly interesting and imaginative propositions

411
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,340
whereas in the mainstream there's far too much emphasis on not stepping out of line,

412
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:12,340
not rocking the boat, and if you say something that isn't what your colleagues are saying,

413
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,340
then you won't get promoted, you won't get a grant and all the rest.

414
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,340
So it must be deadening actually living like that

415
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,340
and I'm just not prepared to live like that and I don't expect you to be a writer.

416
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,340
No, no, but it does.

417
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,340
I mean, it's not a career path one can recommend to other people

418
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:36,340
because it's not very easy to survive outside the framework of regular salaries.

419
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:42,340
Alex is a uniquely privileged being Spanish in a way that we can't be being British

420
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:47,340
because being a scientist in Spain is to be part of the civil service

421
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,340
and once you've got tenure as he has, then you've got it for life

422
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,340
and so he can do what he likes.

423
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,340
So he's in a uniquely privileged position of having an actual salary

424
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,340
which neither of you or I have had for a very long time

425
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:07,340
and the freedom to be inquiring into all these things

426
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:12,340
and talking to you and me and investigating all sorts of areas of science

427
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,340
with a remarkable freedom.

428
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,340
Two caveats here.

429
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,340
One is once you've got tenure, that's one caveat

430
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,340
and what has happened to those who didn't get it

431
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,340
and were perhaps more valuable

432
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:31,340
and also those who got it, how the whole process has shaped their minds, that's one thing

433
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,340
and the second paradox is I have many colleagues who got tenure

434
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:40,340
but they continue, I mean, probably some of them may want to continue doing what they're doing

435
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:44,340
but even having tenure, like some people say, I'll wait until I retire

436
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,340
and then I'll write that book or that idea

437
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,340
and perhaps that's also a good idea to do it later but maybe it's too late.

438
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,340
Maybe it's too late often, I think.

439
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:58,340
One you need to get to tenure and even if you get there, it's no guarantee for anything of that.

440
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,340
No, it doesn't guarantee people or take you seriously.

441
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:06,340
I mean, I used to think that people who got the Nobel Prize

442
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,340
would have enough confidence to do and say what they think and would be taken seriously

443
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,340
but actually even the Nobel Prize is no guarantee.

444
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,340
Brian Josephson, for example, at Cambridge,

445
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:21,340
well, as soon as he got interest in psychic phenomena and the nature of consciousness

446
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,340
although he's a professor with tenure, as a Nobel laureate, a fellow of Trinity College,

447
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:34,340
his colleagues make sure he doesn't get students and that he's marginalized, etc.

448
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,340
because his views are untenable in their eyes.

449
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:47,340
So even the Nobel Prize and tenure, it may guarantee a certain freedom of manoeuvre

450
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:52,340
but it doesn't guarantee that what one does will have much influence.

451
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,340
The influence is perhaps another matter but I haven't found that, I mean,

452
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,340
largely being in the mainstream race of my life has impeded me.

453
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,340
I mean, because I was, you know, I was a fellow of Oxford College

454
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:10,340
and I became a psychiatrist and director at the Bethelman Morsley Hospital in London

455
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,340
which is of all the institutions of mental health,

456
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,340
one of the most, you know, central in the world.

457
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:26,340
And I was salaried but of course there was freedom to use what one saw and think in another way

458
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,340
and I think it's open to more people than one thinks.

459
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,340
They don't have to go out completely on a limb

460
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:36,340
but if you look at what you experience and think about it in a deeper, broader context,

461
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,340
you see something different.

462
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:43,340
And I just think that an awful lot of people see what they're doing in science

463
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:49,340
as sort of self-evident and not raising further questions.

464
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,340
It's a rather unusual kind of mind that asks the question,

465
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,340
so why does it actually do that? Why does it work like that?

466
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:05,340
And I have found one of the best books on this topic is Erwin Chargaff's

467
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,340
autobiography, Heraklite and Fire.

468
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,340
You know, he was a very great, honoured biochemist at Yale

469
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:20,340
who laid the groundwork for Crick and Watson and so on, the author of Chargaff's Rules,

470
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:27,340
but he writes brilliantly and with enormous imagination about what he sees science to be

471
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:36,340
and he contrasts it with this extremely deadening, simple following out of linear paths.

472
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,340
I think it's partly a result of the massive expansion and professionalisation of science.

473
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,340
Exactly.

474
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,340
I mean, so he would say in World War, it becomes a career path.

475
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,340
It was a struggle. In the 19th century a lot of scientists in Britain

476
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:54,340
were either amateurs like Charles Darwin who never had an academic job.

477
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,340
Faraday was at the Royal Institution, not in the university,

478
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,340
in a rather eccentric small institution.

479
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:10,340
But when it became professionalised, something that T. H. Huxley was one of the drivers of in Britain,

480
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:15,340
to make science a professional, like a priesthood,

481
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,340
where only people who got the right degrees and qualifications could teach it

482
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,340
and influence people through universities.

483
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,340
The school system and what was taught in schools and all that was professionalised.

484
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,340
And then you've got to have the right qualifications.

485
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:34,340
His aim was to squeeze out country vicos who did wonderful natural history,

486
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,340
who believed in God.

487
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,340
He thought no one in science should believe in God, or if they did,

488
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,340
it should be kept at least very much their private life.

489
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,340
You've got to have two priestshoods.

490
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:52,340
That's right. You have one priesthood and then this model of scientists as priests

491
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,340
then spread to the Soviet Union.

492
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:59,340
Scientists were the highest rank of the intellectuals and all that kind of thing.

493
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,340
And so it became all over the world.

494
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:08,340
In countries like India and China, engineers and scientists are very, very high prestige.

495
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:14,340
They're not terribly high prestige in Britain because they're regarded as boffins and geeks and things.

496
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,340
The highest prestige goes to people who've been to Eaton and Oxford

497
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:24,340
and who belong to the Bollinger Club and become conservative prime ministers,

498
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,340
at least for a while.

499
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:32,340
So they don't know that the person you're referring to currently enjoys great esteem in the country.

500
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,340
No, no. It's only temporary.

501
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,340
It shows these things are always temporary.

502
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:43,340
But still, the point is that in Britain, scientists have never commanded,

503
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:47,340
Newton's being venerated and Darwin's being venerated and so on,

504
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:54,340
but it's never been like there's quite the priesthood level that it achieves in many other countries.

505
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:58,340
But nevertheless, it's the idea is of a kind of priesthood.

506
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:03,340
And then you've got all the ranks of the sort of deacons and sub-deacons and stuff.

507
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,340
It becomes a whole professional thing. Then it becomes a career.

508
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:11,340
And when I lived in India, I worked with Indian scientists.

509
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,340
I was an Indian International Scientific Institute.

510
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:19,340
Most of my Indian scientific colleagues had not gone into science

511
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,340
because of a deep curiosity about nature.

512
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,340
They'd gone into it because their parents believed in education

513
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:30,340
and science and medicine and engineering were the three top careers.

514
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,340
And so any bright children had been pushed into that

515
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,340
and pushed in their studies and pushed through the university.

516
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:43,340
And then they got jobs in high prestige institutions if they worked hard enough.

517
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:48,340
And their whole social status and the ability to marry off their daughters

518
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:52,340
to more prestigious husbands in an arranged marriage system

519
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,340
moved them up the social scale instead.

520
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,340
It wasn't at all about curiosity for most of them.

521
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:04,340
And I think for many scientists today here in Britain,

522
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,340
it's not primarily about deep curiosity about nature.

523
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:12,340
It's about being a functionary within a system.

524
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:18,340
Well, as Whitehead said, this divorce between science and philosophy

525
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,340
has been a congestion of both.

526
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:27,340
And I think that science properly understood is a form of philosophy.

527
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:33,340
It's an investigation of philosophy in certain particular empirical methods.

528
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,340
But it has philosophical implications

529
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:41,340
and it draws on philosophical principles that it's outset.

530
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,340
You may not understand that it does that.

531
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,340
But that's more dangerous when people don't realize what it is they're doing.

532
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,340
They don't do it well.

533
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,340
But I think that we need to get back to the understanding

534
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,340
that science has philosophical meaning

535
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,340
and that this is not enough discussed.

536
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,340
If one needs philosophically minded scientists

537
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,340
and scientifically minded philosophers,

538
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,340
philosophers who are willing to spend time

539
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,340
learning about the science that will give them insights

540
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,340
into the forming of their philosophy.

541
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,340
Well, I mean, here in Britain the word science wasn't introduced

542
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,340
until the 19th century.

543
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,340
And before that it was called natural philosophy.

544
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,340
And Newton's great book, Principia Mathematica,

545
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,340
the mathematical principles of natural philosophy.

546
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:32,340
So I think that natural philosophy

547
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:35,340
is actually a really good word and for it.

548
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:39,340
I'm a member of the main Cambridge University Scientific Society

549
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,340
which is called the Cambridge Philosophical Society.

550
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:47,340
Because when it was started in the early 19th century

551
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:51,340
it was called natural philosophy as Cambridge.

552
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,340
I subscribed to biological reviews

553
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,340
which was on the main review journals in biology,

554
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:01,340
the subtitles of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.

555
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:05,340
So I think natural philosophy is what you are.

556
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,340
I like to think it's what I and Alex are too.

557
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,340
And I think that probably most people who listen to us

558
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,340
are natural philosophers.

559
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:18,340
And so in a sense it's a matter of recovering

560
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:22,340
what was the root of what we now call science.

561
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:27,340
Before it was hijacked by this professionalization movement

562
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,340
and this creation of this priesthood

563
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:35,340
and making it an exclusive professional organization

564
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,340
that you have to obey the rules of.

565
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,340
One of the things I feel about the age we live in

566
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:45,340
is the predominance of the administrative or bureaucratic mind

567
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,340
over almost every aspect of our lives.

568
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,340
And I think this is deeply damaging

569
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,340
and I think it's an exhibition of the left hemisphere's way

570
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:58,340
of both trying to understand

571
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,340
but misunderstanding what it's dealing with

572
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,340
and above all to control it.

573
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,340
And I think that what has happened is that

574
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,340
yes, I understand the analogy with the church

575
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,340
but what has really happened is that something much less glamorous

576
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,340
has happened in science

577
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,340
which is simply that it's become a huge bureaucracy.

578
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:22,340
It has money to spend

579
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:27,340
which follows people who tow the party line

580
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,340
do more of what everyone else is doing

581
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:35,340
and it's very difficult in this sclerotic hierarchy

582
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:40,340
as it would be in the middle of an enormous Byzantine civil service

583
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,340
to be able to break out and see something else or do something else.

584
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,340
So I think the future will depend on the development

585
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:51,340
of small private colleges where people are very much

586
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:54,340
you take in only the brightest people.

587
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,340
I think that's very important.

588
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,340
We're sort of worried by the concept of elitism

589
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,340
but looked at another way.

590
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,340
Education depends on and our future depends on

591
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,340
people who have the capacity to think clearly

592
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,340
and to think imaginatively being encouraged

593
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:15,340
and that's what a good college should be doing in my view.

594
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:19,340
And so I think it's from those small institutions

595
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,340
which are beginning to spring up in competition

596
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,340
with the great universities

597
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,340
that the future will flourish.

598
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,340
And I'm sorry about that

599
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,340
because I have a great allegiance

600
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:37,340
for the enormously interesting and valuable history

601
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,340
of our great institutions.

602
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,340
I'm very sorry to say this

603
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,340
but they're beginning to turn themselves into something

604
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,340
that can be easily dispensed with.

605
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:48,340
How to prevent those institutions from following the same path

606
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,340
and also how to solve the accreditation problem there?

607
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:56,340
Because in a way that I wanted to ask you both this very question

608
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,340
like you have navigated outside the institutional seas

609
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,340
but nevertheless there's some appreciation for institutions

610
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,340
still in both of you.

611
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,340
Very much so, yes.

612
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:11,340
How much of it can we still embrace

613
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,340
and how much we need to just reject?

614
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:19,340
So back to the future, these future scientists and philosophers

615
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,340
are they going to be in institutions

616
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,340
and if they're not, how is the new order

617
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,340
or the new business going to be

618
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,340
in terms of accreditation and so on?

619
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:34,340
It's like designing a new Atlantis

620
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,340
you know, what's the new new Atlantis?

621
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,340
Four hundred years later.

622
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,340
Well I don't have a crystal ball, I don't know

623
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:47,340
but I think that what you say in the sense

624
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,340
that there needs to be an institution

625
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,340
but it may not be these institutions I think is right.

626
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,340
I mean everything evolves

627
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,340
and evolution is partly that things have their proper period

628
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:01,340
and the great universities, Oxford and Cambridge for example

629
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,340
have a thousand year history

630
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,340
they're currently committing suicide in my view

631
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,340
by not sticking to their guns

632
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:13,340
and so this means that other institutions will spring up

633
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:18,340
because there's a natural need to nourish those

634
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:24,340
who will benefit from being given freedom and discipline together

635
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,340
and the time to fulfill these things.

636
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,340
Let me tell you something about my own experience

637
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:35,340
which will sound horribly, you know, I don't know, unusual

638
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:40,340
but I got this fellowship at 21 of all souls

639
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:46,340
and I was to embark on a doctorate on 18th century English literature

640
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:49,340
and this fellowship was a seven year fellowship

641
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,340
after examination there's this strange thing

642
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,340
that doesn't have any equivalent to Cambridge

643
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,340
or anywhere else in Oxford

644
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,340
of a college that consists only of fellows

645
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,340
not of any students, graduate or otherwise

646
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,340
and when you become a fellow after examination

647
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,340
which is a three day examination

648
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:07,340
if you become one you get seven years

649
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,340
in which to do whatever it is that interests you intellectually

650
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:16,340
and Derek Parfit, a very well-known philosopher

651
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,340
said to me, don't do your doctorate

652
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:23,340
anybody can do a doctorate, that's part of the sort of machinery

653
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,340
but you've been given something completely extraordinary

654
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,340
which is seven years in which you can pursue ideas

655
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,340
and I thought he was absolutely right

656
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:36,340
and at the time I followed all kinds of interests

657
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:40,340
in science, in other languages, in literature, in philosophy

658
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:45,340
and at the time I thought, you know, this is wonderful

659
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,340
but I didn't realise until much later in my life

660
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,340
why it had been so important

661
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,340
and I'm not sure that even, I don't know enough

662
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,340
I mustn't speak about what I'm not certain of

663
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,340
but I think that the ethos of all souls is rather changed

664
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,340
as everything does

665
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:04,340
and there's more of that, you know, we must keep an eye on what he's reading

666
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,340
and has he published a paper and all that

667
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,340
but I was free of that

668
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,340
and later in life I thought, well what did I make of that?

669
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,340
and to me the answer came with the publication of these books

670
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,340
because I couldn't possibly have written them

671
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:20,340
unless I'd been allowed to range wild, as you should say

672
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,340
but I did it within an institution

673
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:27,340
over the fields of things from which I drew

674
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:32,340
the bigger picture I've tried to express in these books

675
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,340
which can only be done if you've had the ability to range

676
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,340
so this business of range

677
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:42,340
which is exactly the opposite of the tendency towards ever greater specialism

678
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,340
is very, very important

679
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,340
and I think that more institutions ought to

680
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:50,340
follow what happened in the 60s

681
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:56,340
which was, you know, institutions used to take people

682
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:59,340
that had proved themselves to be intelligent

683
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,340
and give them carte blanche

684
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:05,340
and they gave them an office, gave them an income for a few years

685
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:09,340
and then said, follow your instincts, you know, what you find interesting

686
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,340
and out of that came many, many inventions

687
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:17,340
Well I had a very similar period of freedom to you

688
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,340
and actually I feel enormously grateful for it

689
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:23,340
and I had two periods of freedom

690
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,340
First of all, when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge

691
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:29,340
I became increasingly disenchanted with mechanistic science

692
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,340
which I was studying

693
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:35,340
I started reading Goethe and I had the idea of a holistic science

694
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:39,340
and everyone assumed I'd go on and do a PhD

695
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,340
because I got a double first

696
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,340
but I wasn't sure if I wanted to

697
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:49,340
I mean I liked science but I didn't like killing animals all the time

698
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,340
and I didn't like treating them as machines

699
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:55,340
and the whole attitude of mechanistic science

700
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:59,340
so I found there was this fellowship at Harvard

701
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,340
that was open to people from Cambridge for a year

702
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,340
in the graduate school, I applied for it and I got it

703
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:08,340
and when I got to Harvard to do history and philosophy of science

704
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:12,340
to step back to see the bigger picture, that's what I wanted to do

705
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,340
I found that they treat graduate students at Harvard

706
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:21,340
in a way I hadn't been treated since I was about 15

707
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:24,340
read these pages this week, read those and we'll test you

708
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,340
to make sure you've read it

709
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,340
it was spoon feeding, there was no freedom

710
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,340
I tried doing what they said

711
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,340
and after about a month

712
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:35,340
I just couldn't do it, I mean you'd have to stay up till midnight

713
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,340
every night to read all this stuff and they'd test you

714
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,340
there was no time to read anything else

715
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,340
to study anything else that interested you

716
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,340
it was completely on their own track

717
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,340
so I went to see the professor of history of science

718
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,340
who was in charge of me and I said

719
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,340
look, I love being here at Harvard

720
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,340
and I'm really interested in these subjects

721
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,340
this isn't the way I learn and this isn't the way I work

722
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:59,340
I don't really need a master's degree from Harvard

723
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:02,340
because I can buy one from Cambridge for 75 pounds

724
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:08,340
and in those days

725
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:12,340
all you had to do was stay alive for three and a third years

726
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,340
and pay five pounds and you've got a master's degree

727
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,340
if you've got a bachelor's, same as Oxford

728
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,340
same as Oxford, yes

729
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,340
so presumably you bought yours too

730
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,340
or maybe you didn't bother

731
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,340
yes, it came to me automatically

732
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,340
I don't think I had to pay

733
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,340
oh yes, I had to pay five pounds

734
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,340
so I said to the professor

735
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,340
I just don't need your master's degree

736
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,340
and he said are you sure

737
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,340
and he said there's a Harvard master's degree

738
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,340
and I said well I'm quite sure

739
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,340
I'll get a Cambridge one

740
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,340
and I said is there any way out

741
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,340
and just be here for a year

742
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,340
and be part of the university

743
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,340
and not do all these exams

744
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,340
and tests and things

745
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,340
I said I think that would be much more useful

746
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,340
and valuable for me

747
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,340
he said well actually we do have a rarely used

748
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,340
provision called special students

749
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,340
and he said

750
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,340
and I said well can you make me one

751
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,340
and he said well I'd have to talk to

752
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,340
the committee and stuff

753
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,340
so anyway

754
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,340
I got him to register

755
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,340
they agreed

756
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,340
and I was registered as a special student

757
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,340
so I was there in the graduate school at Harvard

758
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,340
I was doing a bit of teaching

759
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,340
to earn a bit of money in the natural sciences program

760
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,340
in biology labs

761
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,340
in biology 101

762
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,340
I was teaching lab classes

763
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,340
but otherwise, apart from my obligation to do that

764
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,340
I had complete freedom

765
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,340
I went to lectures in history of art

766
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,340
and philosophy

767
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,340
and classics

768
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,340
in history

769
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,340
I had the entire

770
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,340
I got the university catalogue

771
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,340
and I went through the list of lectures every week

772
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,340
and I did a lot of philosophy

773
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,340
in history of science

774
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,340
but I had an entire university

775
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,340
at my disposal

776
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:49,340
and whenever I was doing exams

777
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,340
I just caught the train to New York

778
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,340
and had fun in New York

779
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,340
for a few days

780
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,340
and it was the most blissful way of being at a university

781
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,340
and then later

782
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,340
when I got my fellowship at Clare College

783
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,340
in Cambridge

784
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,340
it started as a research fellowship

785
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,340
and it was

786
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,340
I had a six year research fellowship

787
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,340
where

788
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,340
my teaching load was limited

789
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,340
to six hours a week of

790
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,340
tutorials and since

791
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,340
in Cambridge, like Oxford, the vacations

792
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,340
last six and a half months a year

793
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,340
this is only six hours a week

794
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,340
for five and a half months a year

795
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,340
and actually less than that

796
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,340
because half a month is exams

797
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,340
it was not exactly an onerous teaching burden

798
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,340
it was the nicest form of teaching

799
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,340
to students at a time

800
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,340
informally in tutorials

801
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,340
and the rest of the time

802
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,340
I was completely free

803
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,340
I don't think I even read annual reports

804
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,340
then I got a research fellowship

805
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,340
from the Ross site

806
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,340
and I did have to write a one page annual report

807
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,340
but I was completely free

808
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,340
and quite into it

809
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,340
when I said to the college

810
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,340
I just got this

811
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,340
thing from the Ross site

812
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,340
a tropical research grant

813
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,340
and I'm going off to the University of Malaya

814
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,340
for a year to study rainforest plants

815
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,340
and travelling through India on the way

816
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:09,340
they said

817
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,340
well fine

818
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,340
it was an incredible

819
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,340
period for me

820
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,340
laid the foundation for everything I've done since

821
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,340
so like you

822
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,340
given an extraordinary freedom

823
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,340
within an institutional framework

824
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,340
which was

825
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,340
vastly valuable

826
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,340
now very very few people have that opportunity

827
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,340
absolutely

828
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,340
and you know what I want to emphasise

829
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,340
is I

830
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,340
like you I think it's very important

831
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,340
like you I feel very grateful for having been given it

832
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,340
my worry is that it won't be

833
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,340
given in the future to many people

834
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,340
but I think it's important

835
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,340
we live in an era

836
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,340
of micro-management

837
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,340
and I think micro-management produces only mediocrity

838
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,340
if you're constantly controlling

839
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,340
and dictating what people

840
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,340
read and think you'll only get

841
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,340
mediocrity

842
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,340
and if you give people a degree of freedom

843
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:03,340
okay there's a risk that they will abuse it

844
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,340
and they won't come up with something

845
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,340
but it's a much smaller risk

846
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,340
than the risk of micro-managing them

847
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,340
which ensures that they will never come up with anything interesting

848
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,340
so you actually have to

849
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:15,340
in a way trust

850
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,340
you have time to people

851
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,340
to explore things

852
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,340
that are of interest to them

853
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,340
otherwise it's the death of the life of the mind

854
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,340
it's for this reason that so many

855
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,340
as we both know

856
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,340
in the past so much of the science of the 18th

857
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:31,340
and 19th century

858
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,340
and even into the 20th century

859
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,340
comes from the work

860
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,340
of priests

861
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,340
of vickers of monks

862
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,340
I mean Mendel was a monk

863
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,340
they weren't part of any particular mainstream

864
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,340
but they had the security of a place

865
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,340
and they were allowed to think

866
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,340
and observe and ask

867
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,340
interesting questions why do people

868
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,340
work in this way

869
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,340
well I think one simple way

870
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,340
this could be achieved at the strike of a pen

871
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,340
is simply changing

872
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,340
the name of unemployment benefit

873
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,340
to research grants

874
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,340
so then we could have lots

875
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,340
of people on research grants

876
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,340
and the stigma of being on unemployment

877
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:17,340
would be transformed

878
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,340
at least for some people

879
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,340
yes very nice

880
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,340
because we after all have a lot of people

881
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:25,340
who are economically idle

882
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,340
as in we're in the classification of governments

883
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,340
who are actually being paid

884
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,340
by the state

885
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,340
and so much of that

886
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:35,340
could be repurposed

887
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,340
I mean mostly people are disempowered

888
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,340
by being unemployed

889
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,340
if this could be seen as a

890
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,340
positive thing

891
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,340
and also

892
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,340
another idea

893
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,340
it's only academics really that have sabbatical years

894
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,340
which is supposed to be

895
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,340
a year in which you can enjoy

896
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,340
the kind of freedom we're talking about

897
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,340
to be refreshed and so on

898
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,340
and

899
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:01,340
so

900
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,340
another scheme would be to make

901
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,340
sabbatical years optional for everybody

902
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,340
so when you're at 40

903
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,340
or 50 or 60

904
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:11,340
you could take an optional sabbatical year

905
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,340
and you'd take a cut

906
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,340
in income, you'd take leave from your regular job

907
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:17,340
and you'd get the unemployment

908
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,340
benefit which would now be

909
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,340
a redesignated research grant

910
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,340
or a sabbatical grant

911
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,340
it wouldn't cost the state anymore

912
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,340
because they're paying lots of people

913
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,340
not to work anyway

914
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:31,340
and by empowering people

915
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,340
who are not working in regular jobs

916
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,340
to think of themselves as doing

917
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,340
something different

918
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,340
it could be voluntary work

919
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,340
it could be natural history

920
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,340
it could be scientific research

921
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,340
there could be small grants

922
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,340
for people on sabbaticals

923
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,340
to set up experiments in their garages

924
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,340
and stuff

925
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:53,340
it could fuel a whole wealth of invention

926
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,340
throughout the population

927
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,340
I'm sure you were right

928
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,340
almost no extra cost

929
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,340
and one thing I

930
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,340
know from experiences

931
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,340
a practical skill

932
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,340
that it has been enormously satisfying

933
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,340
probably more satisfying than almost anything else

934
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:13,340
and so

935
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,340
encouraging people not just to feel

936
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,340
demoralized and not have any goal

937
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,340
it might be better to allow people

938
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,340
to train

939
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,340
to develop a skill

940
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,340
which is a very life enhancing thing

941
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:27,340
and useful to society

942
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,340
there's not enough skilled labour

943
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,340
ones always looking for people who can do

944
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,340
this or that or the other

945
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,340
and maybe that should be part

946
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,340
of the scheme as well

947
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,340
there's already government schemes

948
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,340
for people in deprived areas

949
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,340
economically

950
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,340
for retraining

951
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,340
there's already retraining grants

952
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,340
I haven't looked into how they're administered

953
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,340
but I imagine that

954
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,340
if one got into the details

955
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,340
of existing bureaucracy

956
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,340
and existing grant structures

957
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,340
some of it could be repurposed

958
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:01,340
in a way that's

959
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:03,340
along the lines you're suggesting

960
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:05,340
some of it's intended for that

961
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:09,340
so I think within the present system

962
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,340
there's probably quite a lot of potential

963
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,340
for revisioning

964
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,340
what people can learn and do

965
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,340
so drawing things together

966
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,340
perhaps there's a need

967
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,340
to break out of the straight jacket

968
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,340
of these people are unemployed

969
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,340
and therefore just waiting to get back into

970
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,340
this horrible machine

971
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:31,340
there's life outside the machine

972
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,340
there are other things that can be developed

973
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,340
for all of us depending on

974
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:37,340
what is both practical

975
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,340
for us and enjoyable

976
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,340
for us to develop

977
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,340
and it's about

978
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:45,340
abandoning this

979
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,340
micromanaging

980
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,340
administrative approach

981
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:51,340
to education

982
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,340
to science

983
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,340
and allowing people to develop the skills

984
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,340
that they have innately

985
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,340
in other words education should be a matter

986
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,340
of growing things

987
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,340
not inserting things

988
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:05,340
and at the moment it's mainly about inserting things

989
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,340
but it's interesting

990
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,340
one of the things that's happening at the moment

991
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,340
is the so called skill shortage

992
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,340
or employment shortage

993
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,340
I read an article

994
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:17,340
just yesterday

995
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,340
the mystery of why

996
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,340
we have very low

997
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,340
unemployment at the moment

998
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:25,340
in Britain

999
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,340
and yet you can't get people to do jobs

1000
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,340
but there's

1001
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,340
large numbers of people who are economically inactive

1002
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,340
and so

1003
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,340
most people in Britain assume

1004
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,340
the skills shortage or labour shortage

1005
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,340
is because of Brexit

1006
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:41,340
no

1007
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,340
immigration from Europe

1008
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,340
but

1009
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,340
those are very similar when we were in Canada in the summer

1010
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,340
they have the same situation there

1011
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,340
in western Canada it's the same in the United States

1012
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,340
what seems to have happened

1013
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,340
is that a large number of people

1014
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:57,340
have just voluntarily retired

1015
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,340
from the labour force

1016
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,340
before retirement age

1017
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,340
simply can't be bothered to have a job

1018
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,340
and that must mean a drop in income

1019
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,340
but there's millions of people

1020
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,340
prepared to take that rather than carry on

1021
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,340
well what that tells you is

1022
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,340
that a lot of people's jobs are very unrewarding

1023
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,340
and I think

1024
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,340
what's really sad is that

1025
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:19,340
jobs that are in the past

1026
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:21,340
are obviously rewarding

1027
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,340
like being a teacher or a doctor

1028
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,340
I think people are probably

1029
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,340
not keen to, we know there's a shortage of doctors

1030
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,340
there's a shortage of teachers

1031
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:31,340
and I think that's partly to do with

1032
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,340
the way again a management culture

1033
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,340
has taken over

1034
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,340
from a professional culture

1035
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,340
and the individual is no longer

1036
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:41,340
allowed to pursue interests

1037
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:43,340
and it's entirely

1038
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,340
micromanaged like the Harvard thing

1039
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,340
today you read these things

1040
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,340
or you read those

1041
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,340
so we need to stop this

1042
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,340
and there was a wonderful moment

1043
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:55,340
of creativity early on

1044
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,340
in the Covid crisis

1045
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,340
when managers couldn't keep up with the situation

1046
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,340
and doctors said well

1047
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,340
the hell with it we're going to do what we think will work

1048
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,340
and lots of things were experimented with

1049
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,340
and some of them were successful and some of them not

1050
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,340
but this is a good situation

1051
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,340
there's one in which doctors use their experience

1052
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,340
are not told what to do

1053
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,340
by a manager who has no experience

1054
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,340
and in closing

1055
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,340
it's not only important

1056
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,340
we talk about it but again let me say

1057
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:23,340
both of you are examples that this can be done

1058
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,340
so I think it's useful

1059
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,340
again to have the discussion

1060
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,340
but to show that there are living examples

1061
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,340
and it's not easy

1062
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,340
but it can be done

1063
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:35,340
and hopefully more people in the future

1064
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,340
will be able to

1065
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,340
we've been very fortunate

1066
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,340
yes very fortunate

1067
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,340
both within and outside

1068
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,340
institutions

1069
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,340
all right

1070
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,340
thank you very much

1071
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,340
well thank you Alex
