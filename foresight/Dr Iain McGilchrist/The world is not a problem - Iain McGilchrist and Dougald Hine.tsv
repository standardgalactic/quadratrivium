0	17760	Well Ian, it's great to be here with you on Sky and I suppose how I found my way here
17760	22560	is that for years people have been telling me you must read The Master and his Emissary.
22560	28400	Many people around Dark Mountain have been strongly influenced by it as a book and last
28480	34240	autumn when I had just finished work on At Work in the Ruins I finally sat down with it
35040	45600	and understood why because the question that I'm starting from in At Work in the Ruins is
46880	52720	what's the nature of the trouble that the world is in, not least the part of that trouble that
52800	57920	writes under the name of climate change and early in the book I say whenever we get into
57920	63920	a conversation about climate change that conversation starts inevitably inside the frame of science
64880	70160	because it's science that brings us the news and gives us ways of talking about it. Climate
70160	77040	change is a scientific concept and yet I've been going around for years saying climate change asks
77360	85120	questions that science cannot answer and the example of that that I have sent her on in the
85120	92320	book is how did we find ourselves in this trouble? Is it the result of a piece of bad luck with the
92320	98560	atmospheric chemistry that it turns out seven generations down the line that building industrial
98560	104000	societies around all of these fossil fuels is throwing out of whack the climate system on
104000	109440	which the conditions of possibility of human societies as we've known them have taken place?
109440	117440	So is it bad luck or is it a consequence of a way of approaching the world, a way of seeing and
117440	125360	treating everyone and everything that would anyway have brought us to such a pass even if
125360	130800	the atmospheric chemistry had been different, had been less sensitive to all these carbon dioxide
130800	136960	emissions and I feel like you've given one of the fullest accounts I've come across of that way
136960	147360	of approaching the world. Yes well thank you I suppose when one talks about how we got here
147360	152880	there are a number of different ways you can answer that question so it's not wrong of course to
153680	158800	say that it's a problem to do with use of fossil fuels and so on but that itself
158800	163520	is rooted in something bigger and beyond I believe which is as you say a whole
165120	172720	conception of what we are what the planet is and how the two relate. So how do we begin to
172720	178560	describe that or unpack that in a way that might help us ground the conversations that go on about
178560	184880	climate change differently to the way they often seem to? Yes the difficulty is that there isn't
184880	192560	a very easy way to say well if only you say this or do that it will work it's more a kind of way of
192560	200880	being in the world that we need which we've lost but it can I think encouragingly be recovered and
200880	207920	is you know I see and I'm sure you see this of course that there is a hunger for a way of
208160	214960	thinking about ourselves and what we're doing here that is more sophisticated
215680	221840	and more inclusive than the one that we've we've been taught and we've been sort of
223040	227920	almost without realizing it we've been dragooned into a way of thinking that would have seemed
227920	235120	extremely odd to our ancestors and to most people who are not brought up in the modern western
235120	243040	tradition and it's a very modern thing even in the west I mean I would say perhaps only the last
244080	250560	200 years at the maximum that we have adopted this very harshly reductionist
251520	256960	strictly materialist way of thinking and I think that is at the bottom of what we've got wrong.
257520	264160	And you've used that word modern several times there one of the one of the books that was in
264160	269680	the field of possibility or created the field of possibility for what I've been writing is a book
269680	277440	called Hospicing Modernity by Vanessa Machado de Oliveira who's a Brazilian scholar who's based
277440	285040	in Canada and that image of what is called for in the kind of times we're in being neither to try
285040	291840	and save modernity and make it somehow sustainable nor to try and overthrow it and bring it down or
291840	297840	stage some kind of revolution but being to give it a good ending not least so that it can pass on
297840	303840	the lessons that it has for us that may only be revealed in its in its ending and it feels like
303840	312880	that is part of what this the the hunger or the longing that that you're describing that I think
312880	319680	we both encounter. I like that idea very much because as you say the sort of overthrow he's
319680	326000	always a bad idea to do something peremptory and abrupt but we haven't got a lot of time
326000	332400	and we may not be able to as it were save modernity but as you say it's very important that whatever
332400	338240	we leave is something that is viable and useful to whatever comes after us.
339840	344880	After Paul and I wrote The Dark Mountain Manifesto I found myself increasingly getting invited into
344880	355040	rooms where climate scientists were being brought together with artists and indigenous elders and
355040	361120	people representing different kinds of knowledge or practice and it felt like the the invitation
361120	366480	from the scientists on the one hand there was an assumption that we were going to somehow have a
366480	372400	magic way to help deliver the message get people to listen to what the science was telling so we
372400	380720	were being sort of enlisted as a message delivery system and I say this I don't think this is quite
380720	387920	what we're for but equally where that was coming from there was a sense of helplessness on the part
387920	395520	of the scientists of you know we have the knowledge we can tell people and the kind of knowledge we
395520	401440	produce is what the modern world says is the only kind of knowledge that is reality and yet when we
401440	408000	come with a message that calls into question our ability to just continue and extend these
408000	414240	trajectories of growth and progress and development as they have been understood around here recently
414880	418160	suddenly they're not listening to us any more than they would listen to the protesters who are
418160	427600	outside the gates of the COP meeting and what I've experienced as a paradox is I find myself trying to
427600	434720	say science has to take a humbler role in relation to the other kinds of knowledge and practice that
434720	443760	are showing up here to people who are experiencing a sense of helplessness as scientists or as people
443760	450400	bringing the message from science where to say that more humility might be what's called for
450400	455520	which I think was also in the language that you were using just now at first glance that sounds
455520	460240	like the last thing that is needed and yet there's a deep truth in there and actually a sense of relief
460240	465600	often when we get properly into dialogue with scientists and non-scientists around this at
465600	470320	science not being asked to carry all the weight of knowing the world and telling us what it needs to
470320	476080	what needs to be done absolutely and the the false impression that science can do far more than
476080	484160	science can ever be asked to achieve is one of the reasons for people feeling that science is an
484160	493920	enemy whereas I believe it to be a hugely valuable tool but it is only that and if one can see it as
493920	503760	that and rather over overreaching claims are not made for it then that rift can be reconciled people
503760	511040	can see it for what it is it's when it pretends to be a sort of omnipotent and omniscient or
511040	516160	potentially so you know we're nearly there only a few more experiments and we really understand it
516160	524320	all that is the sort of thing that makes any experience and wise person feel alienated from
524320	533280	the discourse so I think what we want is is to rehabilitate science I find myself in the odd
533280	539840	position that I'm a great believer in both science and reason and I've spent most of my life trying
539840	547040	to practice these these things and it falls to somebody who believes in them passionately
547040	554320	to point out their limitations so another thing that I do is to is to say reason is hugely valuable
554320	559120	but first of all it depends what you mean by reason as it depends what you mean by science
560400	567440	and secondly it depends on what you're asking it to do it can do certain things but beyond that it
567520	573280	can't go so there are certain things that we know are very real but are somehow beyond the reach of
573280	579680	mere reason and the nature of music would be an example we can rationalize about its structure
579680	587440	we can analyze it we can take it apart we can get notes and we can look at them in our electron
587440	594240	microscope and we can say this note is nothing but the music is something very great so it's that
594240	602160	process that needs to be done and so what I'm really saying is the over defensiveness of science
602160	607760	and the over defensiveness of reason are understandable because at the moment they're under attack I think
607760	614080	very wrongly but the reason they may be under attack is because they are misrepresenting themselves
614080	621040	or maybe not even that but there has gone into the popular culture a myth that science can
621120	627200	do everything that reason can answer all our questions but there's absolutely no question
627200	635760	that these claims are unsubstantiated an unsubstantial boom and the analogy that I use is to say you
635760	642480	know how does one be a friend to science yes if your friend is tripping on acid on the roof of a
642480	648080	building and thinks he can fly yes to be a friend to them is not to go yeah man go for it absolutely
648080	651440	it's to put your arm around the shoulder and say why don't we sit down over here and have a little
651440	657200	chat yes which I feel is kind of what you have been been doing in a way that takes it away also
657200	663120	from that the conflictual mode of engagement with the limits of science that doesn't that's a very
663120	671360	good vivid example I like and it's effectively the ancient saying Plato is my friend but a
671360	679520	greater friend is truth and you know so attributed to Aristotle probably wrongly
679520	686480	but it's that that if you are a friend of science and of reason you don't misrepresent it as something
686480	692560	that it isn't because that way you cause a false falling away from it from people who quite rightly
692560	699920	won't accept extreme the extreme positions the very black and white positions that reason
700000	706000	wrongly understood and science wrongly understood can adopt a sort of dogmatic position and dogma
706000	713040	is our enemy in whatever form it comes and in our world now there are far too many dogmas and
713040	719600	are too many things that can't be questioned and when you get to that point as Hannah Arendt said
719600	726560	if things can't be questioned you're in a tyranny so one of the things that I get to in thinking
726560	733520	about this is the relationship between what in my terms is knowledge and knowing
735440	740480	and obviously you know we talked about this last night science as a name for this set of
740480	746800	activities only came in around the 1830s prior to that the people who were doing what we think of
746800	751600	as science would have called themselves natural philosophers and in a sense that shift of name
751600	758560	is reflective of a moment in which a monopoly is being granted where this set of activities are
758560	766320	being seen and seeing themselves as the monopoly on knowing on the work of knowledge because that's
766320	777200	what science means what I found myself um thinking about is the place where maybe these scientists
777200	782800	who I was meeting in these rooms talking about climate change were stark is holding the knowledge
783760	788160	where knowledge is the kind of the fruits of these these activities but it's a kind of it's an arms
788160	794400	length thing and then there's another piece of work which is bringing the knowledge home and if
794400	799200	you think about the way in which the language of knowing I mean if we go to the Hebrew Bible for
799200	808080	example the word to know include can range from you know sexual intercourse to intellectual
809280	818240	apprehension or the fruit of the tree of knowledge in Genesis there is a there's a kind of dance for
818240	828320	me between you know the experience of knowing out of which I distill knowledge that can be shared
828400	834320	which includes the kinds that can be put in books and on shelves and then that dance is completed
834320	840480	at the moment where a reader brings their own experience to the words so as to bring them back
840480	846320	to life in their experience of knowing which will not mirror perfectly the experience of
846320	851680	knowing that led me to write it but it's a bit like two choreographers who use the same set of
851680	856800	choreographic notation the dance that the second choreographer will make from the notations of
856800	863040	the first will be recognizably akin to the first one and so there's this kind of three
863040	867360	three-way move of the experience of knowing the production of knowledge and then the experience
867360	873200	of knowing arising from encountering that which when I then read the master and his emissary felt
873200	880320	to me very close to the dance of the hemispheres that you're describing which was striking because
880320	886320	what I had been saying was I think we've got the a hierarchy where knowledge is held to be the
886320	891200	important bit rather than the experience of knowing that might be part of where we're
891200	896320	getting stuck part of the trouble we ran absolutely that's a very rich vein to mine
898720	904640	and as you know I sometimes contrast and I don't think it's exactly the same but the
904640	909920	difference is that we have in German and French for different kinds of knowledge so there's there's
910000	916960	Canon in German and Konnetto in French which means knowing from experience and there's
916960	923760	Wissen in German and Savoie in French which is to know as it were the facts and another way of
923760	931840	talking is that there is data there is information there is knowledge and there is understanding
932720	938800	and understanding is intelligence and it's what in fact whatever you do with AI but that's
938800	944320	another story you won't achieve that understanding because to have that understanding you have to
944320	951840	have lived an embodied life with emotions and and the body and all the the what we think of
951840	958720	as disadvantages that go with that so yes and the other thing is that what you describe is what has
958720	968160	been amusingly dubbed the McGillchrist manoeuvre which is which is my my theme that in all
968160	976640	understanding there is a three-step process the first take on anything as it were preconceptually
976640	983040	and as a whole is taken by the right hemisphere then at a subsequent stage it is broken down
983120	989600	categorized analyzed it's it's the bare bones of its structure were examined
990240	995920	but then all that knowledge needs to be taken back into the holistic picture of the right
995920	1002560	hemisphere and absorbed there and become in a way implicit in that picture the easiest example I can
1002560	1007040	give is that of learning a piece of music but you're first attracted to it as a whole as you
1007040	1012000	start to play it you realize you have to practice certain passages and you start thinking intellectually
1012000	1017120	about the harmonic structure but when you go on stage to perform you must forget all that not
1017120	1023200	that it was wasted time it was very important time but that now it must be taken up into and become
1023200	1028160	implicit in the whole so I think that's I hope that something to do with what you were talking
1028160	1033360	about with knowledge the distinction of knowledge and knowing I mean perhaps interestingly knowledge
1033440	1042960	is is is a noun knowing is a verbal participle and you're what you're talking about is the
1042960	1051840	idea of something which is a lived experience yes yes exactly and one of the the things that
1051840	1057040	worries me about the ways in which we are responding to things like climate change
1057040	1061200	and actually I wonder if this thought might be extended even to the way in which we responded
1061200	1069280	to the pandemic is this sense of seeing the world through in your terms the left brain
1070320	1075440	perspective so that the world comes to be conceived of as a problem to be solved
1075440	1081920	that if we can just map if we can generate enough knowledge about how the world works
1082800	1088400	then we can come up with the set of solutions for managing the world as if the world is a thing
1088400	1092960	that needs to be turned into knowledge for its own good in order for it to continue to
1093520	1098720	have a chance of existing and I think that people can build very kind of convincing
1099680	1104720	arguments for what needs to be done that could actually lead us to very dystopian places
1105280	1111520	indeed and arguably yeah well and the the analogy which I get from my friend Paul Kingsnorth
1112080	1117680	he talks about all the things that he's learned from keeping a fish tank with a few
1117680	1124720	freshwater fish in it with his son and how this you know you have to measure the temperature it
1124720	1128880	can't get too hot can't get too cold you have a whole chemistry set of different things that you
1128880	1136000	have to drop into it to regulate it and all of this to do what a river or a lake does easily
1136000	1142640	and for free and my concern is that this left brain approach to the world when it is granted the
1142640	1148800	kind of dominance that it has had in modernity comes to can't see the difference between a fish
1148800	1155200	tank and a living world comes to represent the living world as if it were a fish tank and then
1155200	1161600	attempts to turn the world into a fish tank a thing that requires a total system of human
1161600	1171360	management and control yes again there's a there's a lot in that I think one being the difference
1171360	1180320	in scale which shouldn't superficially shouldn't make a difference but it does because what we're
1180320	1184320	dealing with in nature and what we're dealing with in human society and dealing with with
1184320	1193200	everything important in this world are complex systems not complicated systems and the distinction
1193200	1198720	being one which is effectively just like a large mechanical system the complicated system just takes
1198720	1204400	a bit few more arrows and a few more algorithms but the complex system is one that cannot
1204400	1211600	intrinsically be modeled in this way it has reentrant loops it has uncertainty involved in it
1212400	1221840	and so there is a grave danger that complex situations are resolved into a complicated
1221840	1231920	structure there was a hilarious piece of analysis carried out for the US army in Afghanistan by a
1231920	1238560	London consultancy firm and who generated a map of all that was going on in Afghanistan and it's
1238560	1244640	hilarious it's a huge map like this and it's got little centers everywhere and arrows going in every
1244640	1251120	possible direction and when this was presented to General McChrystal a man of experience an
1251120	1257760	amount of action he responded when we understand that we will have won the war which you can understand
1257760	1263760	stand in one of two possible ways and but what intrigues me actually is that at the moment
1264400	1271680	I've just been approached in the last couple of months quite independently by military intelligence
1273120	1279280	pooled between the UK the US and France and another approach from military intelligence
1279280	1288960	in Australia to help them untangle why their sort of systematic abstract ways of working
1288960	1296320	things out are not actually helpful and that we need to reincorporate into this something which is
1297200	1304960	less certain less tied down and if you make a structure too rigid and tighten up all the
1304960	1312080	bolts it's got no movement it will crash down so it needs to have this human intelligence in it
1312640	1319520	another way of putting it is that it needs to be antifragile in Talib's terms but we need to
1319520	1328160	reintroduce the much stigmatized concept of human judgment and intuition I love that story of the
1328160	1337840	map in Afghanistan it makes me think of Borges and the one-to-one map because sometimes it seems
1337840	1346800	as if that's the sort of the unintentional foolishness of this attempt to turn the world into a thing
1346800	1351760	that needs to be known in order to exist and the other example that was coming to mind as you were
1351760	1358800	speaking about it was Dean Bavington who's an environmental historian in Canada who comes from
1358800	1366080	Newfoundland and has written about the Newfoundland cod fishery and the story that he tells is
1366960	1372880	of how the Newfoundland cod fishery collapsed not once but twice and after the first collapse it
1372880	1381040	became the pioneering sort of case study of fisheries management where they were convinced
1381040	1386800	that they now had mapped and knew this wild fishery well enough to say when the boats could
1386800	1392960	go back out again how much fish they could take and through the 80s it was the world's leading
1392960	1400800	sustainable fishery and then in 92 it collapsed again and what he describes in fisheries science
1400800	1409200	is this kind of retreat then from attempting to know the wild living complex world to saying this
1409200	1416000	is beyond our capacity and so what we're going to do instead is move to fish farming where we create
1416000	1422880	deliberately simplified ecosystems that we can know and manage in this way that we failed to do
1422880	1429680	with the wild fishery and of course that is also failing because those systems are never really cut
1429680	1435920	off from the wild world they have inputs and outputs going into it but it seems like there's
1435920	1442800	a sort of spiral there which I see in various areas when we're talking about ecological crisis
1442800	1450560	which is this desire this feeling that we need to know the world in a way that would allow us to
1450560	1458000	intervene successfully in that way and then cycling between a despair at the failure to do that
1458000	1464720	and a sort of desperate optimism of trying to remake the world into something like a fish farm
1464720	1469200	and I think you know in what we've been talking about in the invitation that you're making in your
1469200	1476880	work I feel like there are clues for letting people know that you know the world might be
1476880	1484000	something other than the way it appears through this lens and therefore that the failure that
1484000	1488880	failing to make the world into something that can be known and managed in that way is not the end of
1488880	1496720	the world only at the end of a way of seeing it sure yes no that's that's surely right but I
1496720	1504240	suppose the difficulty would be how people can actually put that into practice that's always
1504240	1511760	the difficult bit yeah it's how do we have you thoughts about that well I think it starts with
1511760	1519040	giving up in a sense yeah yeah you know it starts with stopping it starts to stop into what you're
1519040	1525920	doing which is not working yeah yes and it was Gustavo Estavo who's a Mexican activist and thinker
1525920	1530800	who can really taught me this because he described how he'd had these three times in his life where
1530800	1537200	he had walked away from a situation without being able to explain why and the last time was in the
1537200	1543440	mid 70s when he turned down a job as a cabinet minister in Mexico and he said I couldn't explain
1543440	1548320	to anyone why or what I was going to do but in the way that he talked about it because he then
1548320	1555200	got involved with these grassroots networks and the the pueblos and the and the barrios of Mexico
1555200	1563440	city and it was the until he left that position where he was standing he couldn't see what was
1563440	1569120	invisible from there he had to actually go somewhere else without being able to give anyone
1569120	1576560	a justification of this move for things to come into view because the way that the people he was
1576560	1582080	then working with were seen from above from within the system he'd been working in missed something
1582080	1588320	important about their ability to make life go on so that's the first step of giving up not as an end
1588400	1594720	but as a necessary I say in the book you know giving up is always giving up on something
1594720	1601280	though it may feel like everything until after you've done it so that's the sort of the first
1601280	1610080	move is to stop um stop trying to save the world as we have known it but also stop assuming that
1610080	1615840	if you give up on that then you know how the story ends yes well that wouldn't particularly we don't
1615840	1623200	do as Anne Whitehead said um profits uh we don't know what to do with them perhaps taking them
1623200	1628800	outside and stoning them in some sort of merciful kind of way which is best but when everyone's
1628800	1634880	asked to predict the future um I sort of think of Neil Spore saying prediction is a particularly
1634880	1641360	difficult matter especially when it concerns the future so I don't think we ever know and
1641360	1647520	keeping that space open about what is going to happen is very important and the failure to do so
1647520	1652080	is is all part of this we must have certainty we must follow this path we know what will happen
1652080	1659040	we usually won't be following that path something we didn't know happens like the famous um economic
1659040	1668240	collapse of 2008-9 um where we thought we had now mapped how these markets work so successfully
1668240	1673680	that they would never crash again and they promptly crashed too the difficulty is taking
1673680	1678960	something that works as I mentioned earlier on a small scale and I'm trying to suggest
1678960	1685040	that this is going to work on a larger one for example if you do have a complex system which
1685040	1693840	can't be reduced to um mechanistic uh chains of causation you can nonetheless find a very small
1693840	1699600	isolated part of it where it appears that that's what's happening and you can hone in on that and
1699600	1705520	you can see a little chain of causation and you can interfere with it and produce a result and the
1705520	1710560	temptation is for science there to say so we understand that now but what you've understood is
1710560	1715360	how that little chain of causation there worked but you haven't understood the nature of the
1715360	1723120	hole in which it inheres and and so when one's zooming out from some small scale experiment
1723120	1729120	usually the thing is quite different problem when you are looking at um the hole in which
1729120	1734640	whatever it was you modeled along so the there's a distinction that I use in the book between
1734640	1739920	which came to me from John Michael Greer and it's the distinction between a problem and a predicament
1740560	1745200	okay and he says you know a problem has a solution and the thought experiment he gives
1745200	1750960	is he says so suppose that you can get in a time machine and go back to some a prosperous rural
1750960	1756560	village in the south of England in 1700 equipped with the knowledge of the industrial revolution
1756560	1761920	that is coming and everything that that is going to mean for the people there and suppose that you
1761920	1765760	can actually convince them of all of these things that are going to completely disrupt
1765760	1771200	their ways of life and for a small number of people going to make them amazingly rich off
1771200	1775920	things that no one's dreamed of yet and for many others mean life in factories or going off to
1775920	1784240	fight foreign wars and then they say to you so what should we do and there's no answer to that
1784240	1790160	because it's not a it's not a problem that can be solved it's a predicament okay which mean doesn't
1790160	1794640	mean that there aren't responses doesn't mean that there aren't actions worth taking and some of those
1794640	1800720	will be wiser than others but you know the world that's born out of that which is the world of
1800720	1807360	industrial modernity of the last couple of hundred years that we've been talking about has been better
1807360	1814240	at solving problems than any human culture that the world has ever seen but increasingly over time
1814240	1818560	more and more of the problems it's faced with are the consequences of earlier solutions exactly
1819200	1825360	and meanwhile it almost can't see that some things might not be problems that there might
1825360	1830560	be predicaments and that another way of seeing and acting might be called for in the face of a
1830560	1838400	predicament what would that way of acting involve well suspending the belief that you
1838400	1844400	can solve this now should be an important part of it so a good example of a predicament that we
1844400	1851360	almost still recognize as a predicament would be mortality you know when we meet somebody i remember
1851360	1856160	meeting someone who was a who had his membership card of the cryogenics institute okay with the
1856160	1860640	instructions on the back if you know if you find me dead then put ice around my head and call this
1860640	1867280	number yeah and uh i mean i shook his hand and it felt like the coldness was sort of creeping
1867280	1875440	back into him even while he was alive but most of us kind of at a gut level see that as a category
1875440	1880240	error we see the fact that we're going to die one day is more more like a predicament than
1881120	1887760	a problem to be solved and it doesn't cancel out the meaning of the fact that we're sitting here
1888400	1894000	alive now it doesn't remove there being lots of things we can do with the life that we have
1894640	1899040	but if our response to the fact that we're going to die one day is to try and throw ourselves
1899040	1905200	into treating that as a problem to be solved then that may not lead us to make the wisest use of the
1905200	1910640	time that we have indeed there's a further step we could take which is not only not to see it as a
1910640	1918000	problem but perhaps not even to see it as a predicament but to see it as an inalienable part
1918000	1927200	of life and something that has its strength too i mean if you take i was very impressed by
1928000	1934800	something that mary midgley said when she was 92 and i think she died when she was 96 and she was
1935760	1945520	extremely sharp until the moment she died and she she said it's very easy to come to terms with death
1945520	1951440	because one only has to ask the question what would it be like if you literally could live on
1951440	1959120	this earth forever and i'm sure there may be some people somewhere who say oh marvellous but most
1959120	1967040	of us begin to feel a sort of craziness and almost a sense of panic that there is no end to this
1967200	1976560	and if that is the case that it's better that it has its its finite nature it has its finest
1977280	1985280	then it's only a question of when and nowadays we always think a bigger portion is better but
1985280	1991680	sometimes there's something quite good about the standard portion of a human life as i find myself
1991680	2001840	three school years and nine at the moment i feel quite happy with the idea and i think that i really
2002560	2011840	think that the lack of our awareness of death and what it brings to the picancy of life is is a great
2011840	2023680	loss and in the past of course people would have had a scholar such as i might have had a
2024640	2029280	skull on the table that reminded me from my twenties onwards that i was going to die and
2029280	2034960	that this had meaning and once you once you accept this and you don't see it as the enemy of life
2034960	2042480	but part of the nature of life as i think the chinese the far eastern tradition chinese and
2042480	2048000	japanese are much better at saying that the transiency of things is not a problem to be
2048000	2054560	solved not even a predicament this is in fact something very beautiful and part of their meaning
2055600	2064000	it's a sentence without a full stop on the end has a problem yes and i'm reminded of the story of
2064000	2071440	Beethoven before he went deaf hearing somebody in a neighboring room playing a piece as far as the
2071440	2077040	last note in the scale and not actually going there having to go out to press the note before he could
2077040	2084080	go back to bed the line when paul and i wrote the dark mountain manifesto the line that has
2084080	2089680	stayed with me most deeply is right at the end when we found ourselves saying the end of the
2089680	2097840	world as we know it is not the end of the world full stop and together we will find the hope beyond
2097840	2103600	hope the path that lead into the unknown world that lies ahead and a year or two after we wrote that
2103600	2109040	i found myself sitting with the philosopher david abram talking about this and in that
2109040	2114640	conversation a new turn on that came out which was the end of the world as we know it is also the
2114640	2121920	end of a way of knowing the world and so i think that's what i'm kind of that's what i'm inquiring
2121920	2128000	into and and i feel like you're one of the people who's kind of holding that question at the moment
2129040	2136640	well it is wonderful to to to have that expressed because the the idea of the way in which we know
2136640	2144880	something affecting what it is is absolutely central to to my philosophy and which is why i pay
2144880	2152480	so much attention to attention and the importance of how we attend not just whether or not we attend
2152480	2160080	which is important but how we attend by which of course i don't mean the means by which but the
2160080	2167680	way in which and that changes the nature of the world and i believe that actually once one starts
2167680	2174720	looking at the world with a different kind of attention it can change its nature quite quickly
2174720	2181120	and quite responsibly that has been my experience so we don't have to people often say so what do
2181120	2186720	we do in a way that's a sort of secondary left hemisphere question now we've got a vision of
2186800	2191440	how we want to do things what are the steps we need to take to accomplish it
2191440	2195680	and the left hemisphere servant should say well i will go and do this and you say that's a very
2195680	2202480	good idea and so forth but really what we're talking about is inhabiting our lives inhabiting the
2202480	2208720	world inhabiting the cosmos in a different way which depends on the nature of the attention
2208720	2216000	which means a relationship because attention is never a camera doesn't pay attention
2216800	2224080	a microphone doesn't pay attention it receives and we don't just receive we pay attention and that
2224080	2229360	means that we bring something of our own to whatever it is that we encounter but i also
2229360	2236320	profoundly believe that that's something else responds to our attention i don't never have
2236320	2243920	believed since i was you know a young adolescent that it was true that the world was a sort of
2243920	2250560	heap of non responsive material it always seems to me to be vibrantly communicating with me and
2251280	2257520	and that there is this exchange all the time so it out of that exchange comes what is real because
2257520	2263520	i do believe and i argue philosophically for those who can't see why on earth i would say that
2264160	2270160	in in the matter with things that relationships are primary that what actually exists first of all
2270160	2279360	is relationship and that the things are secondary to the relationships so when there are relationships
2280880	2286640	bits start to stand out and we go oh there's something a thing and that's what we identify
2286640	2294560	but it's a web of relationships when you think about how an embryo develops into the animal
2294560	2304000	it doesn't add a liver and a heart and a spina whatever it these things come out of the hole
2304720	2310160	and they only are embedded in that context of the hole and then they stand out and you go what's that
2310160	2317120	over there we'll call that the liver you know so in an organism there are areas of relationship
2317120	2324640	which become what we then call things and this is quite coherent with um something that means
2325520	2332160	intuitively something to me but is part of all the great so-called wisdom traditions of the world
2332160	2339280	that whatever we mean by god that first grounding whatever that encompasses it all
2340320	2346960	is that its nature is love i mean that is a common theme of all these traditions
2346960	2352720	and love is nothing if it's not a relationship that's exactly what it is it doesn't exist
2353200	2361760	but you know you don't have to things first love exists and out of love come the beings and i believe
2361760	2371840	that the the purpose of this is getting a long way out perhaps but and i think that the purpose of
2373280	2379200	the cosmos one might say why why if there is this ground of being whatever you like to call it the
2379200	2391440	Tao or god or whatever else why did it bother to create and i think the answer is that it itself
2391440	2397440	only becomes fulfilled through this act of creation because there's another and there is a reciprocity
2397440	2404640	so that reciprocity between the divine and ourselves is usually important not just for us
2404640	2411280	but also for the divine which means that we also play a crucial role in it we're not just passive
2411280	2417840	observers once again like the camera or whatever we are making ourselves and we are forging the
2417840	2426560	reality of the universe by our responsiveness and that helps to explain why things evolve
2426560	2434160	in the way that they have done why why was the first as we believe in animacy and how did animacy
2434160	2440560	come about and why was why has this animacy taken the form that it has of developing creatures like
2440560	2447280	ourselves who are in many ways so much shorter lived and more vulnerable than ancient creatures
2447280	2452960	way back down this phylogenetic tree and there are examples of actinobacteria in the depths of the
2452960	2461040	ocean single celled organisms that are themselves over 100 million years old so a 70 year life seems
2461040	2468080	like what's that achieved i think the whole drive of it is towards differentiation the unfolding
2468080	2473760	like the bud that unfolds and it's not the negation of the bud that it turns into a flower it's the
2473760	2478720	fulfillment of the bud that it turns into the flower and the flower eventually to the fruit so
2478720	2484000	all these things that's an image of course from Hegel but that idea that things are fulfilled
2484000	2489280	through their unfolding their individuation without that threatening the integrity of the whole is
2489280	2499040	very important and this process leads through life to two important things one is our greater
2499120	2509040	responsiveness and the other is a much rapider rate of response as a whole as a species or
2510560	2517360	or even as an individual to the world both a more rapid ability to respond and a far more
2517360	2524640	intense and wide ranging response so a vole may well appreciate the things in the garden that
2524640	2530480	i appreciate at some level but there are certainly things that i can see and appreciate as a human
2530480	2535360	that that vole can't which is not to say that the vole doesn't have things that it appreciates that
2535360	2546160	i don't take and that's granted but what we bring to the party is our greater response which includes
2546160	2553040	things like writing the mass in b minor and and this is an extraordinary response to the creation
2553120	2558080	people sometimes talk about it as though well yes but it's so tragic you know we're tragically
2558080	2563520	cast into this pointless meaningless universe and our response is to do this but this is
2563520	2570720	this is back to front that that thing came out of the universe by willingness to listen to it by
2570720	2577040	willingness to write what i write vast willingness to write what he wrote all these things come out
2577040	2582000	of the cosmos they can't come from anywhere else so they're in a sense things that are unpacked
2582000	2589120	that are potential in it so there is no chasm between us and this cosmos and it only looks
2589120	2596400	like it has no meaning and no awareness because science at some stage in the last couple of
2596400	2604240	hundred years decided that it would make a simple principle that it was not going to consider anything
2604240	2610800	that suggested either purpose or responsiveness and and and anything that couldn't be measured and
2610800	2619680	wasn't material and so at the end of its elaborate process it solemnly pronounces i can't find any
2619680	2625440	purpose or or any any evidence that consciousness can be real i mean there really are people tenured
2625440	2632400	professors in western universities who hold the belief that consciousness is an illusion but you
2632400	2639440	know consciousness for there to be an illusion there has to be consciousness and it seems like the
2639600	2645440	invitation that is contained in this end of the world as we know it with all of the
2646960	2654080	the the harm and damage that is unfolding that is also the end of a way of knowing the world is
2654080	2659360	an invitation back in an invitation back into relation absolutely back into participating
2659360	2665280	in the world as we always were anyway rather than pretending that we're standing above it and knowing
2665360	2670560	it and managing it absolutely that is so true and really what i'm saying is that
2670560	2677760	something as simple as practicing changing the way in which you attend to things changes the world
2677760	2685200	and changes you and obviously changes for the better a relationship if you can pay appropriate
2685200	2690640	kinds of attention and of course everything involves a different kind of attention there's a kind of
2690720	2696560	attention that is detached and is entirely appropriate that for example the surgeon who's
2696560	2703040	carrying out a delicate operation and simply has to treat the body as not that person that will
2703040	2711040	wake up from the operation in order to be able to do his or her job efficiently so different kinds
2711040	2716240	of attention are important and they bring us back into connection with something surprisingly quickly
2717200	2723680	and so when people sort of despair about what is happening those who wish to find
2724800	2732080	can find quite quickly what it is that they're seeking and it may be a problem or predicament
2732080	2738400	that many people won't survive that that is always going to be a possibility maybe our
2738400	2745680	civilization won't survive maybe it will maybe it will in a in a in a wiser form in a less arrogant
2745760	2753440	and hubristic form on a much more local level and a much more coherent and interconnected way
2754560	2760560	we don't know but this this business of being taken back into relationship and this
2760560	2765840	receptive this giving and this taking which is so fundamental this can be achieved
2766640	2772000	i'm thinking of an italian philosopher Federico Campania whose work i got to know while i was
2772000	2777920	working on this book and he he has a lovely way of putting it he says sometimes you are
2777920	2784240	born into the ending of a world this is the thing that has happened before exactly and the way that
2784240	2790240	you diagnose this is that the future no longer works because what we ordinarily are talking
2790240	2795760	about when we talk about the future is an extension of a story that we were born into
2796640	2800880	and if you've been born into the ending of that story then attempts to extend it no longer
2800880	2805440	convince anyone and i think a lot of what we've been witnessing around the world in the last 10
2805440	2810880	years or so is the political manifestation of the failure of the future and the appeal of the past
2810880	2815760	is so powerful in politics today attempts to invoke the future don't work in the way they
2815760	2822160	did in the mid 20th century because this world is in some sense coming to an end so what Campania
2822160	2827200	says is so if it is your discernment that you have been born into the ending of the world that you
2827200	2832880	were born into what's worth doing and he says well you can stop trying to make sense according to
2832880	2839040	the logic of the world that is coming to an end and start trying to create good ruins things that
2839040	2844640	may turn out to be helpful to the people beyond the end of this world to those who have to make
2844640	2850560	life work among all of the things that will be left behind and carried forwards but understood
2850560	2856560	perhaps in very different ways after this particular story that we happened to be born
2856560	2861600	somewhere late in has come to an end and i feel like maybe that's what we're trying to do
2861600	2867680	as thinkers as writers as artists right now in networks like dark mountain is to make good
2867680	2873120	ruins things that may turn out to be fertile and full of possibility after the failure of the
2873120	2879760	future that we were promised that's wonderful and i suppose what it suggests is that we don't
2880400	2885680	by any means give up on the future we just give up on the future as a projection of
2886560	2893840	the way we've been doing things exactly and and that that's um a hopeful idea it's a very
2895120	2900880	profoundly productive idea if it can be embraced and again one has to accept
2902000	2908240	limits and mortality is one of them and the civilization has some mortality as well in fact
2908240	2914160	they tend to thrive for a few hundred years probably 300 400 years and then they tend to
2914160	2924080	decay wherever they have been and so we have to accept that there is limitation but the left
2924080	2934240	hemisphere absolutely rejects any idea of boundaries limitations finiteness and the simplest example
2934240	2941120	is that it will absolutely deny that there is anything wrong with it although it has the person
2941120	2947520	has a paralyzed left arm perhaps the whole side of their body they'll just deny that it exists
2947520	2954320	rather than accept that there could be a problem or a limit it's always going for we can do away
2954320	2960000	with the limits the boundaries and a lot of what is wrong with us now is we knew no limits there
2960000	2965120	were no limits to what we thought we could do and the world would still carry on being okay
2965120	2971840	this turned out to be predictably actually um a very stupid thing to believe and i can't really
2973600	2979280	imagine why people still carry on with a philosophy which is all about trying to
2979920	2985680	dispense with what they see as the limits on being whatever we want and doing whatever we want
2986800	2993200	so how do we help the left hemisphere at that point where it's stuck in that limitlessness
2993200	2999040	what what are the moves i mean i think that's what you're doing as a writer it's as difficult as
2999040	3006640	how god could have helped satan in paradise lost lucifer the brightest and best of his angels
3007440	3015760	became this grungy competitive force and this is really an introspective understanding as there
3015760	3021680	is in so many mythologies of an overseeing power that understands and a part of it that thinks it
3021760	3027120	knows but doesn't and that tries to use up the power so it's a very difficult thing to do however
3027120	3033920	there are a couple of things that work in our favor and and the first is that we can we can see what
3033920	3040400	is happening i believe that the left hemisphere is predominant and that this is damaging for a whole
3040400	3047440	range of reasons since it is less understanding and less intelligent and it's a way of going can't
3047440	3056000	be sustained and and that means that we can actively favor what the right hemisphere is
3056000	3064240	we can make a point of listening to understanding and directing our efforts towards receiving
3064240	3070880	what is the right hemisphere can can tell us and give to us and the other is that the left
3070880	3077120	hemisphere is rather like in the emperor with with no clothes on that it sort of believes that
3077120	3083920	it's marvelous and finest on and suddenly you see how pathetic it is and and that that itself is
3083920	3089680	wonderfully liberating insight that we don't have to be tyrannized by this this voice that says
3089680	3095040	we're clever we understand it all it's all mechanical we know it we can just say but actually
3095040	3100720	that's hilarious it's just there's something about laughter in the middle of all this i hope so
3102320	3106400	this takes me back to the the way that i've thought about knowledge and knowing
3106400	3111040	because the example i always use to talk about this sort of threshold between the arm's length
3111040	3115200	knowledge and the experience of knowing is i say think about the moment when you get a joke
3115840	3120960	you don't have any information that you didn't have the moment before but you see something
3120960	3128240	differently and it will affect you emotionally intellectually bodily and it that's the simplest
3128240	3134400	version of the kinds of encounter the kinds of being pulled across a threshold out of the trap
3134400	3143280	that that we need holy i agree and and i think that humor and the great humorists are up there in
3144160	3148240	they're up there in my pantheon along with the great poets because what they're doing is just
3148240	3154000	that a poet doesn't as you were tell you things you didn't know but it helps you to see things
3154000	3159600	that you thought you'd seen but you didn't really appreciate understand or feel and that is profoundly
3159600	3168320	moving and humor is in another way the achievement of this kind of an insight through what they have
3168320	3174000	in common from a sorry to refer to the brain here but what they have in common is that both of
3174000	3181360	these things depend very largely on the right frontal cortex which can understand implicit
3181360	3188800	meaning multiple meaning and tone and all these things that modify meaning which are present
3188800	3194080	in poetry and are present in humor and you know one of the things we absolutely have got to do
3194080	3199600	is to liberate humor again and and say no it's not good enough to say people can't make jokes
3199600	3205600	about things they can make jokes about anything and if you don't like it you know that's for you
3205600	3212880	to sort out so it's as if the the left hemisphere like applying all of this back to the the predicament
3212880	3217840	or problem or whatever it is of the trouble that the world is in not least in terms of climate
3217840	3225760	change left hemisphere wants to design a way out of that to come up with a plan that will somehow
3225760	3232480	allow us to you know reboot the future to have some extension of the world as we have known it
3232480	3238480	and the invitation is somehow to stumble into another way of being human together to stumble
3238480	3244400	into another chapter of the story rather than to design and plan it out on a spreadsheet and
3244400	3250880	implement it in the world yes and that stumble of course is the way the left hemisphere would
3250880	3256080	think of it that it's a stumble but actually what it is is quite probably a wise move that
3256080	3262080	comes from our unconscious and what you're really pointing to is that having everything
3262080	3268400	consciously planned out is not the way to achieve everything in life it's the way to achieve the
3268400	3276400	solution to various incredibly circumscribed problems it's been estimated that 99.5% at least
3276400	3284000	of everything that we know as it were with our body with our with our brain is not in the focus
3284000	3289840	of our consciousness but because of that it can be much much richer and there's an argument for
3289840	3296960	saying that it's something damaging about making things explicit and and focus because you limit
3296960	3304240	them to one single simple idea that has to be pursued whereas in the implicit understanding
3304320	3310400	of a situation one can with enormous economy bring together a whole lot of different
3311120	3317360	elements that come out of the field of one's experience out of being alive and bring them
3317360	3322880	to bear and you know here again I just I often quote this but I think it's so mildless and
3322880	3328480	Whitehead said two things he said that a civilisation advances according to the number of
3329360	3336480	actions and thoughts that can be taken care of outside of the glare of experience and the other
3336480	3345440	was that applying thought is like a cavalry charge in battle it's something that can only
3345440	3352320	been done occasionally is very expensive and requires fresh horses so you can't just be doing
3352320	3358000	this all the time in fact in a way what one would say is that when only brings this cumbersome
3358000	3363680	mechanism of you know focusing on it in the full glare of the spotlight and trying to solve a
3363680	3370880	problem when there is a problem but when things are running well you shouldn't be bringing that glare
3370880	3376240	to bear on it because you will freeze it much as if the pianist starts to remember his fingers
3376240	3382720	while playing then have to stop playing and if the problem is actually the estate of frozenness
3382720	3388320	then you can't attack it with the with the back kind of cavalry charge
3389600	3395600	yes but also what I was thinking is that when you are focusing on it then you are likely to
3396480	3407840	either stumble or march whereas when you are not focused on it it's not so much that you will
3407840	3414240	stumble but you will be guided by something that if you trusted not uncritically and not
3414240	3420160	without a dialogue with yourself often not the conscious one about what are you doing but you
3420160	3426480	will be guided by something which is different from what your immediate analysis at the conscious
3426480	3431520	level would suggest was the way to do it the stumble becomes a dance becomes more of a dance
3431520	3439200	a step in a dance or something of the kind that comes out of one naturally and I think we all
3439200	3445040	have the experience don't we of knowing when that happens that I always think of it in relation to
3445040	3453040	music that if on occasion one dances well and joyously it's because one's not trying to dance
3453040	3459040	at all but the dance is happening in you and through you and the music too that music plays
3459040	3465840	itself through you not you play the music so one more layer as we maybe draw this conversation to
3465840	3473760	a close that's coming to mind for me is this thing that I've been describing as a sort of left
3473760	3480640	hemisphere attempt to to map and respond to the trouble that the world is in I think that a lot
3480640	3486000	of those who in good faith are kind of describing and telling us what we need to do about the situation
3486000	3492800	in these terms it seems to me that they have a map in which the thing that the left hemisphere sees
3492800	3499840	or this this way of seeing and describing the world that is kind of through calculative measurement
3499840	3505920	and that kind of reason that this addresses the deep level of reality and then the things that
3505920	3510240	we're talking about that we might associate with the right hemisphere you know poetry and
3510240	3515600	humor music they'll say well all of that stuff is lovely and it's this thing that becomes possible
3516320	3520560	once the people who think like us have done the hard work of making sure there is a platform
3521280	3527920	underneath it yes and it's almost as if I've noticed this even amongst novelists there is an
3527920	3535840	attempt to resolve Snow's two cultures dilemma from the mid 20th century by staging a marriage
3535840	3545280	between the two cultures in which the you know the scientific side plays the husband and the arts or
3545280	3549360	other ways of knowing play the wife and so they're they're held to be kind of beautiful
3550400	3555520	entertaining decorative they make the world a better place we wouldn't want the world without them
3555520	3562320	but it's a good job we have the practical you see the the stereotypes that this is based on and it
3562320	3570240	seems to me that that then as things get difficult the people who are who have staged that kind of
3571120	3577280	way of seeing things go well now it's time to now it's time for the hard serious stuff which
3577280	3584160	requires us to go into the the left brain mode and of course what you're suggesting and I would
3584160	3590560	say is that this is quite the opposite it's the upside down story yes and it reminds me of the
3590560	3599760	image of somebody who after an evening hard work in the city goes to Covent Garden to amuse themselves
3599760	3605680	watching the magic flute and they see that real life is the hard stuff of working at Goldman Sachs
3605680	3611920	but all this stuff is in the evening from Mozart it's just a decoration but of course it's entirely
3611920	3617760	the other way around that that is the only chance this person is going to have that sort of thing
3617760	3623200	to bring them into touch with reality and what they're doing in that office under strict lighting
3623200	3631200	he said this is a fantasy and not necessarily a harmless one so I absolutely agree with that
3632000	3638400	and it's the story the left hemisphere tells that it is doing the hard work and it's the one
3638400	3643200	that was sold to me as a medical student you know it was almost as though the right hemisphere we
3643200	3646960	don't really know what it's there for but perhaps it's there to prop up the left hemisphere so it
3646960	3652560	doesn't fall over but everything important was done by the left hemisphere but this is not the case
3653360	3659360	and your example of the magic flute for some reason calls to mind for me the most powerful
3659360	3667200	experience of this inversion of the stories of reality which was you know when my son was born
3668000	3673280	and beforehand I was working at the Swedish National Theatre at the time and my boss who
3673280	3678560	was about five years older than me had a couple of young children he said birth is the most animal
3678560	3684160	experience you'll ever be part of and he was of course completely right about that but the bit
3684160	3691040	I was less prepared for was it was also the most mythic experience that the temporality of that
3691040	3697200	journey through birth and the turns within the journey was absolutely something that was familiar
3697200	3703280	to me from you know the terrain of fairy tale and mythic story and the kinds of journey that's
3703280	3712240	being staged in the magic flute that oh somehow the the kind of again the linear accountancy
3712240	3717280	version of time is not the thing that's there underneath not the thing we encounter when we're
3717280	3722880	there with the blood of birth or death but actually in those moments we're not just we're
3722880	3729120	simultaneously drawn into the fact that we have always all along been animals and that to be an
3729120	3734800	animal is to live in dream time and myth time more than to live in the kinds of time that you know
3734800	3740160	the guys under the strip lighting in the city office or lots of the ways that we do science or
3740160	3748640	talk about science imply is they the true real there yes I suppose it's that these existential
3748640	3756240	encounters of birth and death that we realize that time isn't the I think it's very real but it
3756240	3760720	isn't it's not like science science is very real and important but isn't necessarily the way it's
3760720	3767840	now conceived and time is other than the way it is now conventionally conceived and that would take
3767840	3773760	us a long time I have a chapter in the matter of things solely on time and the ways in which the
3773760	3782000	hemispheres see it but I really like that and this idea of a process struck me very forcibly
3782000	3792480	because when my third child was born my mother was dying and my mother was at one part of the M3
3793120	3800720	and my wife was in the labor suite in Winchester and I had to consult with the
3801680	3809600	obstetrical team and take time to go up the motorway say goodbye to my mother and come back
3809600	3816400	to see my daughter born so you can imagine the strange experience of that and the emotions and
3816400	3828960	the sense of being in a non bureaucratic time so yeah well thank you Ian I hope that conversations
3829040	3835440	like this provide sort of strange little openings or doorways through which people have a chance
3835440	3842080	of stumbling into another way of seeing where we find ourselves and we're blinding yes dancing
3842080	3852720	in there another way thank you very much it's been lovely do go talking
