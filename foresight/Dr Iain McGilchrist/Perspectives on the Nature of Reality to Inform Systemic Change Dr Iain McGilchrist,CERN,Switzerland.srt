1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
What am I going to do this evening? I'm going to try to do the impossible. In the old days,

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,280
students used to have nothing very much to do at university, so they used to entertain themselves

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,520
with pranks, like how many people can you fit into a telephone box? And it's going to be a

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,520
little bit like that tonight. I'm going to see how many ideas I can cram into whatever time has

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,880
allowed me. I want to begin by talking a bit about what I call the hemisphere hypothesis,

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:41,760
the question of the difference between the hemispheres, but mainly as a portal to a further

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,920
exploration of reality. It seems to me that at the moment we're puzzled about reality because

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:57,840
there are messages that come to us, particularly from some areas of postmodernism, that there is no

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,520
such thing as truth. Everything is just whatever you make up. I don't believe that for an instant.

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,640
I believe passionately that we are truths. They are rarely simple and they may sometimes conflict

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,840
with one another. So it is hard to set up a program of them, but we can learn to look for them and be

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,200
more successful in finding them. And it's in that project that I've been writing for 30 years,

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,320
first the master and his emissary, and then the matter with things which came out a couple of

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,720
years ago. Well, less than that now, November 21. And in it I try to take strands from what we know

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,800
about the brain, what we know about our thinking patterns in consciousness, and what we know from

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:54,240
physics. These seem like three pretty core ways of looking into the nature of reality. I'm not

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,040
suggesting there is one single easy reality. I'm not suggesting there is one ever-knowable truth.

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,720
I'm suggesting we mustn't ever give up on the idea that it is worthwhile for a human life. In fact,

19
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:16,160
it is imperative for a human life to be searching for such a reality and such a truth. Otherwise,

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,280
we are frankly deluded. And I believe that much of the world I now live in is

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:32,480
suicidally deluded. But I come on to that later. Now, let me see. Oh, that's good. So this is a

22
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,560
quote from Pascal. The twofold nature of man is so evident that some have thought that we had two

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,280
souls. But he's not the only person to have said something like this. Kant said something like

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:54,720
this Schopenhauer, Bergson, Goethe, Nietzsche, the wonderful German philosopher Max SchÃ¤ler,

25
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,560
who in my view is underrated and underread these days. They all had this instinct that there were

26
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,960
two sort of almost people or points of view within us that were somewhat in conflict. Each could be

27
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,760
helpful for some things, but neither of them was complete in themselves. And in fact, incidentally,

28
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,880
in writing this book, I found that there are stories like the story of the master and his

29
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,680
emissary, which gave me the title of my earlier book 2009 from all around the world. The story I

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,360
took there was supposed to resituate the way in which we think about the left and right hemisphere.

31
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,240
When I was in medical school, it was said that the left hemisphere sort of was terribly important

32
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,520
because it controls the right hand with which you do the grasping, and it controls certain elements

33
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:51,040
of language, mainly speech, through which we say we grasp things. But actually, it turns out that

34
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,080
the right hemisphere is far, far more important for getting a hold on the world than the left

35
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,560
hemisphere. And indeed, when people have had a stroke, it is harder for them to recover from

36
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,360
a stroke in the right hemisphere than a stroke in the left hemisphere, even though the left

37
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,320
hemisphere's stroke often affects their speech and affects their ability to use their right hand.

38
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:24,960
So, I could say at this point that in the later book that I've written, The Mashable Things,

39
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,880
which came out, as I say, November 21, I begin by looking at what I call the various portals

40
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,560
through which we can get a grasp of the world at all, get some kind of understanding of it,

41
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,560
receive information from it. And I take it that those are attention, perception, which is not

42
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,400
the same as attention, judgment, the ideas we form on the basis of what we attend to and what we

43
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,880
perceive, emotional and social intelligence, cognitive intelligence, in other words, IQ,

44
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,280
and creativity, because that enters into our ability to interpret what it is we're seeing.

45
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,960
And in all of these, I demonstrate at length, over 400 pages, and I draw on 5,600 pieces of

46
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,920
research, I can demonstrate conclusively that all of these are better carried out by the right

47
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,760
hemisphere. It is more veridical, it is more intelligent, more perceptive, and much better

48
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,600
guide to reality. And when people have right hemisphere, damages has been commented on by

49
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,600
neurologists over the Easter century, they lose any sense of reality, they become deluded,

50
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,560
start hallucinating. And indeed, in schizophrenia, which is the topic that probably rings bells for

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,680
most people when one mentions delusions and hallucinations, what is going on there is something

52
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,640
like a defunct or deficient right hemisphere, which has been compensated for by an overactive

53
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,680
left hemisphere. Anyway, that's all by way of an introduction. But first of all, let me just ask

54
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,800
this question, most of you here will have heard something like this, what hemisphere differences,

55
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,400
that's all complete rubbish, that was all blown out of the water 30 years ago, it's all nonsense,

56
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,240
don't even listen to it. And there's a sort of circular thing that happens here, this is what

57
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,120
people were taught, so they never looked, because they never looked, they never found anything

58
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,920
different from what they've been told. So much later in their careers, they don't want to spend 30

59
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,400
years like me actually finding out what are the differences between the hemispheres, because it

60
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,160
would mean the end of their career, they'd be despised by their colleagues, they wouldn't get

61
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,760
promotion. So I'm afraid this is a question of a, and what you might call an urban myth,

62
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,320
it is an idea that itself needs powerfully to be debunked. If you don't believe me,

63
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,720
read my work, it is enormously well referenced, you can look up everywhere what it is that I'm

64
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,160
referring to, and why it is scientifically based. I'd just like to ask you three simple questions,

65
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,800
why is the brain divided? This is a picture by the Salius, and we were in Basel the other day,

66
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:12,240
and passed by accident a house, it said here lived the Salius. So in 1542, this slightly grumpy looking

67
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,480
man had the top of his head lifted off, and here you see the left hemisphere pushed slightly to

68
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,600
decide to expose this band of fibres at the base of the brain called the corpus callosum.

69
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,320
Why is the brain divided in this way? If the power of the brain is in making connections,

70
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,160
why have it so massively divided? And it's not just our brains, by the way, it's all the brains

71
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,200
we've ever looked at, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, right down to insects having separate

72
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,760
different ganglions. Wherever you look, and in fact, the oldest creature that we know has a neural

73
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:54,240
network, which is said to be the ancestor of the mammalian brain, a sea creature called nematosella

74
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,960
vectensis, the brain is the neural network is somewhat divided and asymmetrical, which is the

75
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,000
next thing I'm coming on to. Why is the brain asymmetrical? Here you're looking up at the base

76
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,880
of the brain, as if you were looking up your own spinal column, and you can see that the

77
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,200
right hemisphere, which is hopefully on the left, is larger than the corresponding frontal

78
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,160
layer of the left hemisphere. And similarly at the back, the left hemisphere is larger than the

79
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,720
right. When I was in medical school, that was always said to be because of language, but we

80
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,400
know it is nothing to do with language. It has become used by language now that the brain has

81
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,320
its expansion, that the expansion was not caused by language, because it's there in chimpanzees,

82
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,520
gorillas, orangutans, and other creatures that we've tried to teach language to and got nowhere.

83
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,720
And the third thing is the corpus callosum itself, this band of fibres, which only 2% of brain

84
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,840
fibres actually cross from one hemisphere to the other. It's rather wonderful, this suburban doorbell

85
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:11,440
suddenly coming in from the cosmic reaches. What I've got here is a normal human brain over, whoops,

86
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:20,480
there. And over here, I was very privileged, I got a slice through Donald Trump's brain,

87
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,520
and, oh no, sorry, it's a dog's brain. But anyway, what you see is that the dog's brain

88
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:35,440
is smaller than a human brain, quite a lot, but the corpus callosum, which is, if I can do this,

89
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,800
this, oh, band of fibres here, and the same thing in white over here, in the, whoops, in the,

90
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,720
there. The dog didn't have a drink. And so you can see that it's not as big

91
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,440
comparatively with the brain. So the corpus callosum is getting smaller over evolution,

92
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,160
and it only started in mammals, prior to mammals that wasn't a corpus callosum at all.

93
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,240
And get this, the main purpose of the corpus callosum is to inhibit, to tell one hemisphere

94
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,040
to the other one, keep out of it. Many of the fibres that cross the corpus callosum, for those

95
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,320
of you who are neuroscientists are excitedly, they're glutamatergic, but they abut on GABA

96
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:31,360
ergic neurons, which are functionally inhibitory. And that, why this might have a reference to

97
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,800
human culture is expanded in this book, The Master and His Emissive. Why would this have

98
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,520
anything to do with human culture? Well, I'm going to explain to you that the two hemispheres have

99
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,480
evolved to do completely different things. And in this book, I go into that and the philosophy of

100
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,000
it. But I also look at the history of human culture and suggest that there are times when we

101
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,520
have got these two aspects of our brains out of balance. I'll come on to that. Now, as was

102
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,280
mentioned by Amir, a central concept for me is attention. When I discovered that one of the

103
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,000
most important distinctions between the two brain hemispheres was the way in which they pay attention

104
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,560
to the world. It didn't immediately dawn on me why this was so significant, because I had been

105
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,840
trained in a mechanistic way of thinking about the brain, which was that attention is just another

106
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,400
cognitive function that can be measured in the lab, and it could be simulated by a machine.

107
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:33,200
A machine can be directed towards something, but it can't pay attention to it. And attention

108
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,640
is something very special indeed, because I believe it actually creates the world,

109
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,360
the only world that any of us can know is the world that comes into being for us. And that world

110
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:53,680
is a combination of something coming from us and something out there. And I believe that this is

111
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,680
a two way relationship. In fact, that all things in the cosmos have two way relationships are

112
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,600
reverberative in their nature. And I'm trying to get away from naive realism on the one hand,

113
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,400
and the naive idealism on the other. Naive realism, I call rot, that the reality is out

114
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,000
there, R-O-T. And that's just nonsense, that there's just a world out there and we record it

115
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,320
passively like a photographic plate or a sound recorder. No, something of us goes into what we

116
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,920
find there, which is why what we find there has some very general common ground, but it is not

117
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,040
identical in every experience, even by the same person, never mind by different persons.

118
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:43,760
But I also don't think that it is what you might call mumbo made up miraculously by ourselves,

119
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,680
M-U-M-B-O, which is the kind of postmodern idea that it's just a fantasy out of our brains.

120
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,200
It is something that happens between, in what I call a betweenness. And a betweenness is not

121
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,440
just a gap between. It is like an electric current. Where is the electric current? Is it in the

122
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,640
positive terminal? No. Is it in the negative terminal? No. It needs them. Is it in the space

123
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,480
between? No. It's in the whole ensemble. And betweenness is what happens when two things come

124
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,480
into a new unit and something comes about that is different from either of any of its component

125
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,880
parts, but subsumes them. So they're necessary but not sufficient. Now this is the mountain behind

126
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,520
my house. Its name derives from a Norse word, which means a sloping rock. And you can see why,

127
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:41,680
because from the sea, this mountain was a signal to the Vikings who came there a thousand years ago

128
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,000
that this was a very dangerous bay in which they would be shipwrecked. So to them, this mountain

129
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,360
was a landmark that meant life and death. But there were people here before the Vikings. There

130
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,480
were the Picts and they've left their broths, their stone houses. And we know that for them,

131
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,880
this mountain was the home of the gods. Then in the 18th century, people came to draw and paint in

132
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,760
Scotland. It's a very beautiful landscape. And they would have seen this as a many-coloured,

133
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,920
many-textured form of beauty. And then in the 19th century, people came and they were interested

134
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,120
in geology. And it just happens to be an extremely good example of columnar basalt formation.

135
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,720
So to all these people, it was something different. And then to a physicist, you ask a physicist what

136
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:36,080
it does. But 99.99% of it is empty space. And the other bit, 0.01%, we don't really know what it is

137
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,880
after all. So which of these is the real mountain, I ask you. Now my answer to that is that no one

138
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,280
of them is the full story. But each of them is the real mountain. Each of them is a real way of

139
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,440
looking at the mountain. And if you say to me, yeah, but come on, it's just a big lump of rock.

140
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,440
That already is a very specialist way of looking at it, which betrays your values and your particular

141
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,360
narrowness of way of viewing. Because it's many, many things. If you apply that across the world,

142
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,520
you realise that attention is a creative act. Attention is a moral act. Because what you make

143
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,040
of the world is something that really comes out. When I attend to you in a certain way,

144
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:23,120
I can bring something that is warm, good, beneficent, perhaps healing as a good therapist or

145
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,640
doctor might be able to do. If I pay attention to you in a clinically detached way, I can make

146
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,880
you feel very small, very alien, and so on. We create the world around us. We actually make

147
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:42,560
things through our attention. So how you attend matters, because it forms up like this. Once you

148
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,680
start looking in one way, you find only the bits of the world that respond to the way you look.

149
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,640
The world is a machine. So you look at it. This is mechanical. That's mechanical. The other is

150
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,520
mechanical. The whole thing is a machine. But that's because looking at it as a machine,

151
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,760
all you see are the bits that respond to that mechanistic view. And if you do, you then start

152
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,040
to look further in this same way, thinking that was a good start. And now you just harden up. So

153
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,560
after a few decades, it's very difficult to break out of a habit of mind that we are instilling

154
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,880
into people in the West, which was never held at any other time in human history, never held in

155
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,680
other parts of the world and the West until very recently, and is extremely odd.

156
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,240
This is the kind of attention paid by the left hemisphere targeted on something. The reason that

157
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,960
we have these two hemispheres, you measure why do we have these two hemispheres, is because the

158
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:45,040
left is good at one thing only. It's much better than the right at grabbing, at grasping. And even

159
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:53,520
the processes whereby we say we have grasped something, we have big glyphin, or indigene,

160
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:05,760
or indeed, comprendre, is to grasp hold of, or apprehend, is to grasp onto. Comprehend is probably

161
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,160
different. It's sort of see the whole together, which is what the right hemisphere alone can do.

162
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,920
But this is how the left hemisphere looks at the world. A leads to be job done. But the broad view

163
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,560
of the right hemisphere sees that A and B are connected, but not as directly as you thought,

164
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:29,360
and that the system is living, hence the birds and the tree, and complex, not just complicated.

165
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,160
You may say it's very facile to talk about one hemisphere as a whole. And of course,

166
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,600
I am neurologically trained. I'm psychologically trained. I know that there are different areas

167
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,520
in the brain. I know they have different functions. If you read my writing, you will find that the

168
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,600
different areas do. But it is also now known that instead of thinking in a modular way about the

169
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,880
brain, we should be thinking more in terms of whole networks. And indeed, when you excite one part of

170
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,080
the left or the right hemisphere, there will be excitations that spread much more widely

171
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,480
throughout that hemisphere. And this is to show you a couple of, sort of, if you like,

172
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,720
superhighways of transmission, the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the insonant fasciculus,

173
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,280
showing connections between the posterior part of the brain and the frontal lobes and between

174
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,000
the frontal lobes and the temporal lobe. So this pains me. I'm going to do something

175
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,880
it's extremely simple-minded and much more black and white than I would like it to be. But because

176
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,400
I just don't have time, you'll have to take it as a bit of a caricature, but broadly speaking,

177
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,080
it is what you can accept. And if you want to know the finesse and all the details,

178
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:57,040
then read my books. So there are various differences. And one is that the left, I put the left hemisphere

179
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,960
version on the left and the right hemisphere version on the right. And in these dichotomies,

180
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,640
there are somewhat false dichotomies because nothing can be cut and dried when it comes to

181
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,080
anything as complicated as the brain. But nonetheless, there are strong tendencies

182
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:21,760
for the right hemisphere to be able to apprehend new experiences of whatever kind, new music,

183
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,240
new person, new shape, whatever it might be. Whereas the left hemisphere latches on to what

184
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,080
is already known and familiar because it's looking for food. It's looking for things to pick up

185
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:41,520
with its right hand. And the evolutionary point here is that if you're only attending to food

186
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,840
and a twig to build a nest and all the utilization of the world, the manipulation of the world,

187
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,040
which the left hemisphere is good for, you'll soon be eaten by another creature while you're

188
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,680
getting your own lunch, because you need to be looking out for predators, for your mate,

189
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:04,880
for your constasifics. And so you have to have some part of your brain that is holding the whole

190
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,160
picture together while you go about grabbing and picking what you know. It prefers what is certain

191
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,280
to what is possible. In other words, it likes things to be cut and dried, black and white.

192
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:25,760
Whereas the right hemisphere is more open to ambiguity. The left hemisphere prefers fixity.

193
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,640
It likes to fix things. And literally, when people have a certain kind of damage to the right

194
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,400
posterior hemisphere, they begin to see normal flow of motion broken up into

195
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:50,400
like a sort of an old fashioned cine film that's got stuck or stop go animation.

196
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,080
Because after all, it's targeting something and wants to catch it. So it fixes it and picks it up.

197
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,720
So it sees a lot of static bits, whereas the right hemisphere sees that everything is flowing.

198
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,920
The left hemisphere sees parts where the right hemisphere sees the whole.

199
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,120
The right hemisphere has the body image in it, which is the whole image of the body and all

200
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:19,680
modalities. The left hemisphere has a nose, an elbow, a knee, a foot. Explicit versus implicit.

201
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,960
So the left hemisphere understands what is explicit, what if you have a dictionary and a grammar,

202
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,560
and perhaps a computer could put them together. But all that is implicit, which is nine tenths

203
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:38,160
of what matters to us, things like love and a sense of the sacred and the meaning of music

204
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:45,040
and the understanding of poetry, the understanding of humor, sarcasm, irony, all these things that

205
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:52,000
change the way the world is to be interpreted are taken at face value by the left hemisphere,

206
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,680
though understood by the right. The left hemisphere tends to abstract things from their context.

207
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,120
And if you take things out of their context, they change their meaning completely.

208
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,560
And the best way to understand something is to see it in the context, which makes it what it is.

209
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:12,400
Nothing is something outside of its context. The context is what actually creates it,

210
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:19,200
which is one of the reasons I say that relations are prior to things. The title of my later book

211
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,800
is the matter with things, which is a pun about our obsession with matter and our obsession with

212
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:32,400
things. But things, I say, arise secondarily out of a web of relationships. They are the things

213
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,640
that catch our attention. They are the little hubs where things cross, but actually they are

214
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,600
only what they are because of their relations. In abstracting, it turns whatever it has into a

215
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,160
general case, not a unique one. And here, because I'm in Switzerland, this first time I've ever

216
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,880
talked about this with two wonderfully described cases, rather sad cases. One is of a woman who

217
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:04,080
spent her whole life describing and writing about the birds of Switzerland. And you have a wonderful

218
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:12,880
bird life here in Switzerland. And she had a right posterior temporal parietal stroke.

219
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:21,680
And afterwards, she said, all the birds look the same. This is pretty tragic. And another is a

220
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,160
case of a farmer, Swiss farmer, who knew all his cattle by name. But after a stroke, he had difficulty

221
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:34,880
telling a cow from a horse. So you see, it deals in very broad categories, but the right hemisphere

222
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,240
sees the unique case, sees the ewness of you, and the vesseness of your friend.

223
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,360
The left hemisphere is mainly interested in how much of something the right hemisphere mourn,

224
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:55,200
but how, what is the quality of it? Naturally, this world becomes inanimate. And the right

225
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,400
hemisphere sees the animosity. And you can actually isolate one hemisphere at a time,

226
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,880
painlessly, experimentally, using something called transcranial magnetic stimulation. And if you

227
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:15,360
suppress the right hemisphere, people see what they would normally think of as living as inanimate.

228
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,800
If you suppress the left hemisphere, they see things that we would normally think of as inanimate,

229
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:28,000
like the sun, as a living being. The left hemisphere is remarkably optimistic,

230
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,000
ridiculously optimistic. Again, you can isolate one hemisphere at a time. And this is done sometimes

231
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,480
prior to brain surgery. And it's called the WADA test. And while one hemisphere is isolated,

232
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,320
the other one is not contributing. It lasts for about 15 minutes. During that time,

233
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,480
some psychologists administered a personality inventory to the subject and also to the subject's

234
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,080
relatives and friends and discovered that the left hemisphere has a very high opinion of itself

235
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,960
compared with what other people think. But when it was the right hemisphere's turn, the right hemisphere

236
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,920
was a little bit too negative about itself, but more realistic. And the most extraordinary

237
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,560
demonstration of this is denial. This is terribly important because I believe we now live in an age

238
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,600
of denial. All around us, we are denying a whole host of things, trying to not see them at all or

239
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:28,960
saying the opposite is the case. And this is very literal. After the left hemisphere stroke,

240
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,160
somebody may have a paralyzed right arm or right leg, and they'll be very unhappy about this. They

241
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,080
will weep about it, complain to the doctor. But if they've had a stroke in the right hemisphere and

242
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,520
the left side is paralyzed, they may completely deny there's anything wrong. So you can see them in

243
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,120
the morning after they come into the stroke in the night and say, how are you? And they say,

244
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,880
fine. They say, oh, that's very good. And any difficulty moving anything? No, no. Can you move

245
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,600
your left arm? Yep. Can you show me? And they go there, but nothing actually moved. And if you

246
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,320
bring it round in front of them and say, move that, they say, that's not my arm. That belongs to that

247
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:11,040
person over there, or it belongs to you, doctor. And the most important, but least exciting,

248
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,880
perhaps, of this list is the difference between something that is truly present and something

249
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,480
that is represented. Now, represented literally means presented again, after which is no longer

250
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:30,400
present, is therefore already past finished dead. And presenting is something that we don't allow

251
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,280
the world to do nowadays, because we're so quick with our representations. Oh, it's one of those.

252
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,640
It's a picturesque scene. It's a lake. It's a car. It's a water. We don't, only if we practice

253
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:50,800
mindfulness, are we able to get back to that state in which we are fully present and the world

254
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:59,600
is fully present to us? Okay, that's because I didn't know how to build that slide. Hello.

255
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,080
Yes, we've heard from you before. Now, so effectively, what you've got here, I'd like

256
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,200
to draw this together. So you see the kind of world that the left hemisphere brings into being

257
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,000
for us. It's effectively, I think we may have more problems with my poor skills at building slides,

258
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,320
but let's see. Ooh, that's all right. So first of all, you've got a world in what we take for reality.

259
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:36,560
Better?

260
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,880
Yeah, yeah. Has it stopped working?

261
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:54,960
Well, it's been very quiet all along. I'd have liked it to be louder, but I'm not a technician.

262
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,320
No, I'm fine. Oh, that's better. That's a bit too much.

263
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:16,800
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So first of all, what we take to be reality is in fact,

264
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:24,160
just a representation, a map, a picture, a diagram, but not the complex living home.

265
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:32,880
One that is, in fact, made up of isolated things, things moreover than known, familiar,

266
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:40,800
decontextualized, fixed, predetermined, and made up of bits, fragments, disembodied,

267
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:48,000
having no meaning or coherence until we give it to them, where all is abstract,

268
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,680
generic in nature, infinitely reproducible and quantifiable, and therefore inanimate

269
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,680
and mechanical. And the future is a fantasy which would be only better if we could get

270
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:14,400
more of it under our control. Whereas, in the right hemisphere, one sees that nothing is ever

271
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,720
entirely certain or predictable, that all things are ultimately interconnected,

272
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,600
that there is nothing that is ever fixed, but in fact that, as Heraclitus said, everything flows,

273
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,800
that what exists are holds, the parts are an artifact of the left hemisphere's way of looking at

274
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:43,520
it, that meaning is implicit, and that the world of uniqueness is real, not just categories that

275
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,880
can be quantified, but having different qualities, and an essentially animate world.

276
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,200
And here there's a future that is a product of realism, not denial. We've got one

277
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,840
hemisphere that sees just a theory of the world, it's very simple and pleasing and is only going

278
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:10,080
to get better. The right hemisphere is seeing the whole embodied, impassioned business of vitality

279
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,000
and seeing that it is not necessarily leading somewhere we want to go.

280
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,160
And there is a relationship between the brain and the structure of the cosmos.

281
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,640
That's something I'm going to try and explain now. There is a sort of hierarchy of the right

282
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,200
and left, let me say this first of all. I think I've explained that the right hemisphere is more

283
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:39,920
veridical, that it is a better transmitter of producer of reality, and the left hemisphere

284
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:46,640
has certain limited uses. What it sees is not wrong, it's not that it's got no use,

285
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,320
it's just that its use is very limited and its knowledge is limited. The problem only becomes

286
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,600
when it thinks it knows more and we pay attention to that very narrow way of thinking as though it

287
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,320
gives us the full picture, which it doesn't. So there's a hierarchy there and I think this is

288
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,560
also demonstrable in physics, I've explained that. And I would say that when we're talking about

289
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,760
how we would like to make a world, it's a fantasy for us to imagine that we can just make up a world

290
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,160
without understanding both our own brains and the cosmos. And so this is where we need to start from

291
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,560
in all our exercises of imagination.

292
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,600
In whatever exists, there is a replication of this thing about the brain, which is that the

293
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,360
left hemisphere tends to divide in order to understand, but then cannot put it together again.

294
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:46,320
But the right hemisphere tends to see the whole and see the whole picture of which what the left

295
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,360
hemisphere has been looking at is just a part. Now, we need both these kinds of attention,

296
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,840
but one of them is more important than the other, the capacity to see the whole.

297
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:03,520
And there are these forces for division and forces for union throughout the physical cosmos as well

298
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:10,560
as the metaphysical one. And what we need is the unity of the forces of division and union,

299
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:17,840
not the division of the forces of division and union. Do you understand? I sometimes say we

300
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:29,280
don't want either, either or or both and we need both either or and both and. I hope that's entirely

301
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:39,600
clear. So this idea of the unity of difference and unity is the first asymmetry. The cosmos is founded

302
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:48,560
on asymmetry. So this is all played out in this recent book of mine in two volumes,

303
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:58,400
1300 pages of text, 1500 all together. Now it's based on this idea that science and philosophy

304
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,920
should never have been divorced. The word science in English only began being used to

305
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:10,720
specialize meaning in 1830. Until then science meant knowledge. And indeed what we call science

306
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,600
is called natural philosophy because in fact, what scientists don't see anymore is there is no such

307
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,240
thing as just looking because the way you attend the preconceptions of which you attend alters

308
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,680
what you find. If you don't know anything about philosophy, you just think it's obvious that

309
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,840
everything is mechanical because that is the philosophy of our age. That is what people suck up

310
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,480
from all around them as they grow, that everything is mechanical, but it is not actually mechanical.

311
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,960
Organisms in particular are not like machines in at least eight ways which I explain in this book.

312
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,520
And here I'm quoting from my favorite English philosopher of the last 100 years, the antagonism

313
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:59,360
between science and metaphysics is like all family quarrels being disastrous and from calling

314
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,480
words science and metaphysics are inextricably united and stand all four together. Any of you

315
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:12,400
who hear a scientist, please take that away and think about it. It does matter. And one of the

316
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:19,680
things that I wanted to talk about was the centrality of attention to what comes into existence. I've

317
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:26,560
talked a bit about that already. Then the coincidence of opposites. Now to our way of thinking now,

318
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,480
how can opposites coincide? It sounds impossible. We're taught at school that if it's this then

319
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,840
the opposite is as far away from it as possible. But this is not the case actually because mental

320
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,840
space, metaphysical space and indeed physical space is curved. It's not linear. And the further

321
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,320
you go in a certain direction, the more you find yourself coming back to what you are running away

322
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:57,840
from. It's a truism that anarchy leads to tyranny, that something extreme gives rise to its opposite

323
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:03,120
because it has its opposite in it. I've always thought that politicians is extreme left and

324
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,440
extreme right. You can hardly get a razor blade between them. They've got the same mentality

325
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,000
which is to miss all the shades, the complexities, the subtleties of human existence.

326
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,600
And I've already mentioned that I believe that relations come before a lot of the things that

327
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,800
are related. And then I just want to say something about limit cases being inverted. This is my view

328
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:35,360
of reality that in the old world, in the old world of physics, we thought that this was a

329
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:41,040
Newtonian world, that things are naturally static and they don't move unless they're given a push.

330
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,440
But now we know that there is nothing that is actually static in the entire cosmos. Everything

331
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:52,400
is in motion and stasis would be the limit case of motion, not motion, the limit case of stasis.

332
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:01,120
Representation is the limit case of what is actually real. Total independence is the limit

333
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:07,120
case of interdependence because everything is interdependent. There is no such thing as total

334
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,880
independence but if it exists at all, it will be the limit case of the norm which is interdependence.

335
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:21,280
Discontinuity is not the norm which then gets connected. Continuity is the norm. You may say

336
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,440
why do you say that? I can quote physicists who say this. Metaphysically, I believe it to be the

337
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:35,200
case. From observation of the world, I believe it to be the case. But discontinuity is the limit

338
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,720
case of the continuous. The explicit is not the norm and the implicit, some very strange thing that

339
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:50,800
happens in a poem. Implicit is what all our knowledge is. Explicit knowledge is a very special case

340
00:36:50,800 --> 00:37:00,480
that we learn how to say in words through the process of education. The literal is the limit

341
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,960
case of the metaphorical. Everything is metaphorical. Even the words, in fact, particularly the words

342
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,040
used by science and philosophy, a point that has been made by philosophers themselves,

343
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,120
are based on metaphors because they're dealing in an abstract realm and they therefore have to draw

344
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,320
things from a real world. In fact, the word abstract is itself, something that means being

345
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,960
dragged away. I mean, it's very physical. So meaning is effectively metaphorical and the

346
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,680
literal is only a special case of the metaphorical in which you privilege one kind of meaning.

347
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,200
Randomness, which actually doesn't exist anywhere in the cosmos, would merely, if it existed,

348
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:46,640
be the limit case of order, which is everywhere. Simplicity represents a special case of complexity

349
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:55,360
because the more you go down, even into the quantum vacuum, this is the simplest thing that we know.

350
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,480
According to David Tong, Professor of Physics at Cambridge, it's unbelievably complex.

351
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,680
Simplicity is what we make when we clear away all the complexity. Ah, I've got a mechanism.

352
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,960
How lovely. That gives me a little tweak power. The determinant is the limit of the indeterminate.

353
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,280
Everything is actually ultimately indeterminate, but in very special cases, if you take the window

354
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,960
narrow enough, you can say it looks determinate. And straight lines are the limit case of curves,

355
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,320
not curves, some special case of straight lines. So all that exists is a kind of form.

356
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,720
And in the words of Whitehead, beyond all questions of quantity, there lie questions

357
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,320
of pattern, which are essential to the understanding of nature. And form is a matter of tension.

358
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,760
Can I go back? Yes. This is from my favorite

359
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,960
presocratic philosopher, Heraclitus, or my favorite philosopher, frankly,

360
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,240
they do not understand how a thing agrees with variance at variance with itself.

361
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,880
It is an attunement turning back on itself like that of the bow and lair. What did he mean?

362
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,640
He meant that things are always in balance of their opposites, that wherever something exists,

363
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:18,240
its dark side, the other end of it is there as well. And that what you look for is not to collapse

364
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,640
this creative tension into just this or just that, but to hold the tension. For us, this is

365
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,880
uncomfortable. Therefore, we try to collapse it. Oh, it's just that or it's just that. No,

366
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:36,080
you have to hold the two opposites. And the bow and the lair is the string of the bow,

367
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:42,560
the string of the lair gives rise to the note that gives rise to the flying arrow. And if you

368
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,840
let that tension go slack and didn't pull into opposite directions, pulling in opposite directions

369
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,320
is logically a waste of time. But actually, it's essential to everything that exists,

370
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,360
because this tension is creative. You want to make a good apple pie, you don't get boring,

371
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,120
bland apples, you get nice tart apples and put lots of honey with it.

372
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:09,680
And this is one of his deepest sayings, grasping, which means the coming together of things,

373
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,320
hose and not holes, convergent, divergent, constant dissonant from all things one,

374
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,400
and from one thing all. I would love to have time to unpack that for you, but

375
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,920
take it away and read it and think about it. And that relates to the idea of one and all.

376
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,320
I have a chapter on the coincidental or positive or on the coincidence opposites,

377
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:38,080
and a chapter on the one and the many. And I say it is wise, or he says it is wise,

378
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:44,160
listening not to me, but to the logos, which is like the founding ground of being,

379
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,840
to agree that all things are one. And I foot in brackets and that the one is all things,

380
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:55,040
because the Greek grammar allows this ambiguity of dual interpretation.

381
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,240
As I say, he also, and this is the second important point about physics, is that everything flows.

382
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,640
That's not the same as everything changes. There is a Buddhist saying that everything changes.

383
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,320
It's good as far as it goes, but everything flows is better, because not only does it suggest

384
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,560
there's a difference between the meaning of flow and just the succession of things,

385
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:22,640
but also it contains within it the important idea that when things flow,

386
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:29,680
they both are different and the same. The river that flows by my house is always the same river,

387
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,800
but the water is always different. And Heraclitus said famously, you can't step into the same water

388
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:42,240
twice. But that is beautiful, because he also said by changing things remain the same.

389
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,320
See, this very interesting idea that comes from observing the flow,

390
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,080
that in the flowing it remains what it is, but it also becomes something other.

391
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,880
Then here is Democritus, another early Greek philosopher. The cause of coming into being of

392
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,080
all things is the vortex. The vortex, of course, is a whirlpool. And this is terribly important,

393
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,000
because, well, this is about flow really. This is David Tong again from Cambridge.

394
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,360
At a fundamental level, nature is nature discreet or continuous. I see no evidence,

395
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:20,400
whatever for discreteness. All the discreteness we see in the world is something which emerges

396
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,080
from an underlying continuum. Contra are emergent, they're not built into the heart of nature.

397
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,080
So there we need discontinuity and we need continuity, but continuity

398
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,680
trumps, if you like, discontinuity. It is able to overarch the two.

399
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,880
And here is the vortex. And there's various interesting things about the vortex. First

400
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,880
of all, if you look at a whirlpool in a stream, a whirlpool is photographed or measurable. It can

401
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:56,720
move stones. Is it in the water? No, it's not in the water like the stone is in the water. It is

402
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:04,000
water. For that moment, it is that water. And I believe that beings, including every one of you

403
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,160
here, if you think about your nature and your being, you are like this whirlpool in that you are not

404
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,480
distinct from whatever it is that constitutes as a sort of indigestible lump. You are from

405
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,760
something that is already there, that takes the form you take at the moment. And when you go,

406
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,200
it will be passed on and will still be part of the flow of the river. So there are various things

407
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:35,600
about vortex. One is that it has the nature of a spiral, as you see. And spiral staircases are

408
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:42,640
very important because they are a good image of how we progress in life. TS Eliot said that the end

409
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,680
of all our voyaging is to return to the point where we started from and know it for the first time.

410
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,920
But that's not actually true. We don't ever return. We can't ever return to the point we started from

411
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,200
because it's gone. We come back somewhere higher on the spiral and look down at where we had been

412
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,320
before. But nonetheless, the progress is in one sense circular, but it's also up.

413
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,040
And this is Jacob's Ladder, as depicted by the poet and painter William Blake,

414
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,240
romantic poet and painter. And it's the only Jacob's Ladder I know, which shows it not as a

415
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,440
straight line to heaven, but as a spiral that climbs in this way forever.

416
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:35,680
And this is really just to say, if you look at a spiral down its axis, you see a perfect circle,

417
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,280
which is static and eternal. But if you look along the side of the spiral, you see that it's

418
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,520
actually not a particle, but a waveform, and that it is extending somewhere in space. It has

419
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:55,920
circularity, recurrence and newness in one. This is just to show that in flow, there is always

420
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,040
movement, which is reciprocal. That's one of the things that flow gives rise to.

421
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,920
And these are rather interesting. These are photographs taken of the flow in water.

422
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:20,640
And what has been done is simply a straight line of rectangular rods that are rectangular in cross

423
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:28,400
section immersed in the stream. So absolute rigidity, straight pieces, bars in a line.

424
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,080
And what you get is this completely wonderful creative newness, which flows and changes.

425
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:44,240
This is something called the Karman Vortex Street, which is created by an obstruction simply stuck

426
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,400
into the flow of water. And it results in this amazingly beautiful form. This is suggesting that

427
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,480
flow and the obstruction of flow are creative. In my philosophy, resistance to flow is as

428
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,240
important as flow. Resistance is creative. Without resistance, nothing can happen. What is friction?

429
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,640
It's what stops movement, but it's also what starts movement. Without friction, I can't take a step.

430
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,040
So these things come together in this way. And this is from Leonardo. He's showing an old man

431
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,120
leaning on a stick in the water. And there he shows the patterns that follow, which he describes as

432
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:30,320
like braided hair coming from the stick. And the most beautiful ratio on which many aesthetic

433
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,640
figures and pictures and so on are based is the so-called golden section, which is asymmetric.

434
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,760
It has this interesting asymmetry built into it. And this is just to say that each of those rectangles

435
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:53,680
is in relation to the next rectangle in the ratio of 1 to 1.61, which is roughly speaking,

436
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:01,200
that of the golden ratio. And it relates to a spiral. Here you can see the generation of the

437
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:08,720
spiral out of it. This spiral is, again, part of the asymmetry of nature. And they're both going

438
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,200
forward from something, but completing something at the same time. These are snowflakes. They are all

439
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:25,600
the random, we say, expression of form. They are all beautifully, in one sense, themselves,

440
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:31,840
but they are also fractal. So as you go down the stem, you see further expressions, which are of the

441
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:40,400
overall nature of the whole snowflake. And this is fractality, which is another expression

442
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:49,360
of difference in unity. So there is a unity. And as you go down into it, and things differentiate,

443
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:56,080
they become more and more versions of the same thing in the way that beautiful things often have

444
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:09,280
this asymmetry built into them. I mentioned the golden ratio. But here is an example,

445
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,040
so many of them from Japanese art, where there is both symmetry and asymmetry. And get this,

446
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:23,680
it's not just asymmetry that matters. It's the asymmetry of symmetry with asymmetry. Look at that.

447
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,520
In a way, it is symmetrical, but in an important way, it's also asymmetrical.

448
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:33,840
And it's the coming together of these two opposites that creates beauty. This is very profound in

449
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:40,400
beauty. Here is Palladier's villa, the Villa Capra, now known as the Villa Rotonda,

450
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:51,280
in the region of Vicenza Padua. And you see that in this, in some ways, very formally perfect,

451
00:48:51,360 --> 00:49:02,240
symmetrical facade. There are little signs of life. There are these figures that these figures

452
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,880
that are living and asymmetrical. And here there is a goat, which was the coat of arms of the

453
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:16,640
Capra family. And so it has a sense of the beautiful symmetry, but complemented by asymmetry.

454
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,840
Now look at this, which is a copy of it basically, built at the University of Virginia by Thomas

455
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:32,480
Jefferson, who is a not inconsiderable architect. It's just symmetrical. I had to put that in,

456
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,040
because there's asymmetry and symmetry and the asymmetry of symmetry and asymmetry.

457
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,440
So something about sameness and difference is very important. We don't just want

458
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:52,480
difference or sameness, but both together. And this is from Goethe, from his father,

459
00:49:53,680 --> 00:50:00,400
dividing the united, uniting the divided is the very life of nature. This is the eternal

460
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:07,760
cistern and diasterly, the eternal coalescence and separation, the inhalation and exhalation

461
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:14,960
of the world in which we live and where our existence is woven. And cistern and diasterly

462
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:22,240
are the two beats of the heart, cisterly is the lup and diasterly is the dup of relaxation.

463
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:31,440
Now, just to finish on physics, I wanted to quote Pasteur, who of course was a biologist,

464
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:37,120
the universe as a whole is asymmetrical. And I've come to believe that life, as it is

465
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:46,960
manifest, is a function of the asymmetry of the universe. I would even say that living

466
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:53,040
species are primordially in their structure, in their external forms, functions of the cosmic

467
00:50:53,040 --> 00:51:02,000
asymmetry from his inaugural lecture in 1854 at Lille. And here, some 40 years later,

468
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:09,200
is Pierre Cooley, of course, a great physicist, certain elements of symmetry may coexist with

469
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,800
certain phenomena, but they're not necessary. What is necessary is that certain elements of

470
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:21,040
symmetry do not exist. It is asymmetry which creates the phenomenon, the effects produced maybe

471
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:30,080
more symmetrical than the causes. And I just put this here, in 1956, this Chinese lady made this

472
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:37,440
discovery of the violation of parity, which means the left and right hand are not symmetrical,

473
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,200
in the case of the weak interaction, all the other forces that have been discovered were

474
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:47,360
symmetrical, but then she discovered this is asymmetrical. And I'm sorry to report to you that

475
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,480
about three or four years later, two men got the Nobel Prize for this discovery.

476
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:59,920
There we are. Now, what has this got to do with the world we live in? I'm going to do this very

477
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:08,000
quickly, you'll be glad to know. I believe that over the course of the history of the West,

478
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,920
we've gone through phases. In the Greek civilization, there was a sudden efflorescence of everything,

479
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,840
of the arts, of the sciences together. Then in the Roman world, there was something similar.

480
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,000
And in each of those cases, it tailed off over 300 or 400 years and that civilization disappeared.

481
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,920
And then again, in our age, the sudden eruption of wonderful working together of the right and

482
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,320
left hemisphere, which are both necessary for science. In fact, the more important one is the

483
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:41,120
right hemisphere. So don't ever quote Mia saying that left hemisphere is science and the right

484
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:47,120
hemisphere is the arts. We need both for both. And in both cases, the right hemisphere asymmetrically

485
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:55,280
is more important than the left, even in science. I believe that in our world, like those worlds,

486
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,000
in which I've shown in the second part of the masternism, that things have drifted further

487
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,200
and further to the left hemisphere point of view, it's happening to us now. Now, if I'm right, let's

488
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:15,280
do a little fantasy. Let's imagine that actually, the left hemisphere was the only one we were

489
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,040
listening to. What would the world look like? Well, there'll be a loss of the broader picture.

490
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:28,880
Knowledge would be replaced by information's tokens or representations of true understanding.

491
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,920
Wisdom wouldn't get anywhere near it because wisdom is much too unmeasurable. The product of a

492
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,000
properly lived human life has nothing there that the left hemisphere can get hold of.

493
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,400
Can't be operationalized. There'll be the loss of the concepts, therefore, of skill and judgment,

494
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:51,520
which are essential to being a fully functioning human being. They'd all be taken over by machines

495
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,800
that had algorithms and things like that. So we'd spend hours talking to machines and getting nowhere

496
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,680
instead of talking to people who would exercise skill and judgment. I'd hate to live in that world.

497
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:08,000
And there'll be simultaneous abstraction and reification. So one of the same time,

498
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,640
things would become more and more abstract. The stuff you read would have more and more

499
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,240
abstract nouns in it. It wouldn't refer to reality. At the same time, matter would become just lump

500
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,520
and matter. I always say that materialists are not people who overvalue matter but undervalue

501
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,760
matter because matter is very, very special. Even if you believe there is only matter, then you've

502
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,640
got to accept that matter gave rise to Bach's and John's passions. So it's pretty amazing stuff.

503
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,080
Bureaucracy would have a field day because, according to Peter Berger, a great sociologist,

504
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:47,520
these are the characteristics of bureaucracy. I'll let you read them. And there'd be a loss

505
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:53,200
of the sense of uniqueness, just categories. On those things, you had to fill out which box.

506
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,320
There's never a box for me. But wait a minute, with whom, on which day, in what circumstances,

507
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:06,480
and in what mood, quantity would become the only criteria, not quality. There'd be a sort of either

508
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,200
ornus. No, you can't have, well, it might be this, it might be that. You've got to go, yes,

509
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:18,400
it's this or yes, it's that. Reasonableness would be replaced by pure raciocination,

510
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,640
which is not the same thing. In German, there's a distinction, as you know, the German speakers

511
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:28,240
here between Vernunft and Frischland. And we don't have this distinction in English. So I make the

512
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:33,600
distinction between reason, which is an embodied thing that comes with experience and being able

513
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:40,240
to think clearly, whereas rationalization is just the application of logical rules.

514
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,640
There'd be a failure of what we call common sense, and there's now extremely uncommon.

515
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:50,480
There'd be systems designed simply to maximize utility, loss of social cohesion,

516
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,000
depersonalization, paranoia and lack of trust, because the left hemisphere wants to control.

517
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,120
Its only power is control. So if it thinks things are slipping out of control, it's starting,

518
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:06,400
how can I control them better? We need more cameras. We need perhaps a database. Yes,

519
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,680
let's have a database of the genomes of the population. There'd be a need, in other words,

520
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:18,400
for total control and anger and aggression would be the term of our conversations.

521
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,360
People think the bad old days used to say, oh, the left hemisphere is down to earth,

522
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:29,440
reliable, but not emotional. Whereas the right hemisphere is a bit given to moods,

523
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:34,640
you know, that's terrible. But actually, the emotion that most strongly lateralizes,

524
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,520
of all emotions, is anger, and it lateralizes to the left hemisphere, not to the right.

525
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:46,560
And we would, you remember how when something doesn't work, oh, it's nothing to do with me,

526
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:51,760
I can't be responsible, remember that? Well, we would be the passive victims of other people's

527
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:59,680
doings, never a problem with us. And in this world, art would become pretty conceptual. It would have

528
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:07,200
Latin, a sense of depth and bizarre perspectives. These are things that only the right hemisphere

529
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,240
can fully understand, and therefore came into being three times in Greece, in Rome. It wasn't

530
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:19,760
just invented in Florence in 1453. It was invented serially, and then lost the civilization decayed,

531
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,640
because it's how the right hemisphere sees depth in the world, not just the screen in front of it.

532
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,600
Music would reduce a little more than rhythm, because that's the only bit the left hemisphere

533
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:35,760
gets. The complexities of melody and harmony are interpreted by the right hemisphere, that is

534
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,240
the distinction in professional musicians who train their brains especially, but that's the norm.

535
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,720
And language would become, I hope not too much like mine, diffuse, excessive, lacking in concrete

536
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,920
reference. There'd be a deliberate undercutting of the sense of awe or wonder, because what does

537
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,320
that mean? It just means you haven't done enough research yet. Of course, we understand everything.

538
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:01,360
One more experiment, and we really have got it, that actually to be fully present in the world and

539
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:07,360
to understand it, and to be appreciative of it with gratitude, which is the secret of a fulfilling

540
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:14,640
and happy life, we need to be able to rediscover the sense of awe or wonder. And flow would just

541
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:20,800
become an infinite series of pieces like a goods train. There'd be discarding of all tacit forms

542
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:26,240
of knowing, everything having to be explicit, network of small complicated rules strangling us.

543
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:34,960
This is what the top fill saw in America in 1837. That was a very prescient man. And we would be like

544
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,840
Descartes proudly calling ourselves spectators rather than actors in the world sitting on the

545
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:48,800
sofa with a six-pack, watching it all go by on the telly. And all this would be accompanied by

546
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:54,160
a dangerously unwarranted optimism. Well, thank goodness we don't live in that world.

547
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:07,440
So this is my last words, values. Shaila created this pyramid of values. And I say these are the

548
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,040
only ones that we now respect, the values of utility and pleasure. All the other ones, what

549
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:22,880
he meant by Laban's verta was courage, magnanimity, fidelity, generosity. All of that seems to be the

550
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,920
sort of thing that nowadays only suckers do that. And other people profit from it. So why would you

551
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,520
do that? Why don't it just be a dog with each dog? Values of the intellect, geistig verta, of course

552
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:38,880
you know that geist means both mind and soul. These would be things like beauty, goodness and

553
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,720
truth, the platonic virtues. And at the top is das Heilige, the holy. And I believe we have inverted

554
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:50,320
this. So in our left hemisphere world, the holy is just a fiction that enables certain priests to

555
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:56,080
have power. The values of the intellect are really just to do with sexual selection. The values of

556
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:01,600
vitality, as I say, are those espoused by people who don't know any better. And thank God they do

557
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:06,000
because we can take advantage of them. And really it's all in the service of use and pleasure.

558
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:13,200
Well, we live in an upside down world, my friends. This is where we are now. We've lost value. We

559
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:20,080
have a lust for the power to manipulate, which is the left emitter's raison d'etre. We seem to have

560
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:25,520
lost any sense of purpose, because we think of purpose in the utilitarian way. The purpose of the

561
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,440
of the copy of the copying machine is to

562
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:41,520
purpose the copying machine and whereas we have a purpose, even when it's not a utilitarian

563
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:48,320
purpose. And lastly, there's a blaring of boundaries between truth and falsehood now.

564
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:55,440
There's a war on truth, basically, all around us, from politicians and from various sectors

565
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:03,840
of society, which is that of bureaucracy and AI, turning everything that is living into

566
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:09,760
a series of processes. And I can talk, as you can well imagine, for a very great

567
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:22,880
deal of time about those and have done on other occasions that I'm not going to do now. Thank you.
