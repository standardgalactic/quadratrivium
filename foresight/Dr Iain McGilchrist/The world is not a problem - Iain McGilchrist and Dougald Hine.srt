1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,760
Well Ian, it's great to be here with you on Sky and I suppose how I found my way here

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,560
is that for years people have been telling me you must read The Master and his Emissary.

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,400
Many people around Dark Mountain have been strongly influenced by it as a book and last

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,240
autumn when I had just finished work on At Work in the Ruins I finally sat down with it

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:45,600
and understood why because the question that I'm starting from in At Work in the Ruins is

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,720
what's the nature of the trouble that the world is in, not least the part of that trouble that

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,920
writes under the name of climate change and early in the book I say whenever we get into

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,920
a conversation about climate change that conversation starts inevitably inside the frame of science

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,160
because it's science that brings us the news and gives us ways of talking about it. Climate

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:17,040
change is a scientific concept and yet I've been going around for years saying climate change asks

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,120
questions that science cannot answer and the example of that that I have sent her on in the

12
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:32,320
book is how did we find ourselves in this trouble? Is it the result of a piece of bad luck with the

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,560
atmospheric chemistry that it turns out seven generations down the line that building industrial

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,000
societies around all of these fossil fuels is throwing out of whack the climate system on

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,440
which the conditions of possibility of human societies as we've known them have taken place?

16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:57,440
So is it bad luck or is it a consequence of a way of approaching the world, a way of seeing and

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:05,360
treating everyone and everything that would anyway have brought us to such a pass even if

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,800
the atmospheric chemistry had been different, had been less sensitive to all these carbon dioxide

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,960
emissions and I feel like you've given one of the fullest accounts I've come across of that way

20
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:27,360
of approaching the world. Yes well thank you I suppose when one talks about how we got here

21
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,880
there are a number of different ways you can answer that question so it's not wrong of course to

22
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,800
say that it's a problem to do with use of fossil fuels and so on but that itself

23
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,520
is rooted in something bigger and beyond I believe which is as you say a whole

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,720
conception of what we are what the planet is and how the two relate. So how do we begin to

25
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,560
describe that or unpack that in a way that might help us ground the conversations that go on about

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,880
climate change differently to the way they often seem to? Yes the difficulty is that there isn't

27
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:12,560
a very easy way to say well if only you say this or do that it will work it's more a kind of way of

28
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:20,880
being in the world that we need which we've lost but it can I think encouragingly be recovered and

29
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,920
is you know I see and I'm sure you see this of course that there is a hunger for a way of

30
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,960
thinking about ourselves and what we're doing here that is more sophisticated

31
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,840
and more inclusive than the one that we've we've been taught and we've been sort of

32
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,920
almost without realizing it we've been dragooned into a way of thinking that would have seemed

33
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,120
extremely odd to our ancestors and to most people who are not brought up in the modern western

34
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:03,040
tradition and it's a very modern thing even in the west I mean I would say perhaps only the last

35
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,560
200 years at the maximum that we have adopted this very harshly reductionist

36
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,960
strictly materialist way of thinking and I think that is at the bottom of what we've got wrong.

37
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:24,160
And you've used that word modern several times there one of the one of the books that was in

38
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,680
the field of possibility or created the field of possibility for what I've been writing is a book

39
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:37,440
called Hospicing Modernity by Vanessa Machado de Oliveira who's a Brazilian scholar who's based

40
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,040
in Canada and that image of what is called for in the kind of times we're in being neither to try

41
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,840
and save modernity and make it somehow sustainable nor to try and overthrow it and bring it down or

42
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,840
stage some kind of revolution but being to give it a good ending not least so that it can pass on

43
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,840
the lessons that it has for us that may only be revealed in its in its ending and it feels like

44
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:12,880
that is part of what this the the hunger or the longing that that you're describing that I think

45
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,680
we both encounter. I like that idea very much because as you say the sort of overthrow he's

46
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,000
always a bad idea to do something peremptory and abrupt but we haven't got a lot of time

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,400
and we may not be able to as it were save modernity but as you say it's very important that whatever

48
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,240
we leave is something that is viable and useful to whatever comes after us.

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,880
After Paul and I wrote The Dark Mountain Manifesto I found myself increasingly getting invited into

50
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:55,040
rooms where climate scientists were being brought together with artists and indigenous elders and

51
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,120
people representing different kinds of knowledge or practice and it felt like the the invitation

52
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,480
from the scientists on the one hand there was an assumption that we were going to somehow have a

53
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,400
magic way to help deliver the message get people to listen to what the science was telling so we

54
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:20,720
were being sort of enlisted as a message delivery system and I say this I don't think this is quite

55
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,920
what we're for but equally where that was coming from there was a sense of helplessness on the part

56
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:35,520
of the scientists of you know we have the knowledge we can tell people and the kind of knowledge we

57
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,440
produce is what the modern world says is the only kind of knowledge that is reality and yet when we

58
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,000
come with a message that calls into question our ability to just continue and extend these

59
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,240
trajectories of growth and progress and development as they have been understood around here recently

60
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,160
suddenly they're not listening to us any more than they would listen to the protesters who are

61
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:07,600
outside the gates of the COP meeting and what I've experienced as a paradox is I find myself trying to

62
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,720
say science has to take a humbler role in relation to the other kinds of knowledge and practice that

63
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:23,760
are showing up here to people who are experiencing a sense of helplessness as scientists or as people

64
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:30,400
bringing the message from science where to say that more humility might be what's called for

65
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,520
which I think was also in the language that you were using just now at first glance that sounds

66
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,240
like the last thing that is needed and yet there's a deep truth in there and actually a sense of relief

67
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,600
often when we get properly into dialogue with scientists and non-scientists around this at

68
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,320
science not being asked to carry all the weight of knowing the world and telling us what it needs to

69
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,080
what needs to be done absolutely and the the false impression that science can do far more than

70
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:04,160
science can ever be asked to achieve is one of the reasons for people feeling that science is an

71
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:13,920
enemy whereas I believe it to be a hugely valuable tool but it is only that and if one can see it as

72
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:23,760
that and rather over overreaching claims are not made for it then that rift can be reconciled people

73
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:31,040
can see it for what it is it's when it pretends to be a sort of omnipotent and omniscient or

74
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,160
potentially so you know we're nearly there only a few more experiments and we really understand it

75
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:44,320
all that is the sort of thing that makes any experience and wise person feel alienated from

76
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:53,280
the discourse so I think what we want is is to rehabilitate science I find myself in the odd

77
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,840
position that I'm a great believer in both science and reason and I've spent most of my life trying

78
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:07,040
to practice these these things and it falls to somebody who believes in them passionately

79
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,320
to point out their limitations so another thing that I do is to is to say reason is hugely valuable

80
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,120
but first of all it depends what you mean by reason as it depends what you mean by science

81
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:27,440
and secondly it depends on what you're asking it to do it can do certain things but beyond that it

82
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,280
can't go so there are certain things that we know are very real but are somehow beyond the reach of

83
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,680
mere reason and the nature of music would be an example we can rationalize about its structure

84
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:47,440
we can analyze it we can take it apart we can get notes and we can look at them in our electron

85
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,240
microscope and we can say this note is nothing but the music is something very great so it's that

86
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:02,160
process that needs to be done and so what I'm really saying is the over defensiveness of science

87
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,760
and the over defensiveness of reason are understandable because at the moment they're under attack I think

88
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,080
very wrongly but the reason they may be under attack is because they are misrepresenting themselves

89
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:21,040
or maybe not even that but there has gone into the popular culture a myth that science can

90
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,200
do everything that reason can answer all our questions but there's absolutely no question

91
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:35,760
that these claims are unsubstantiated an unsubstantial boom and the analogy that I use is to say you

92
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,480
know how does one be a friend to science yes if your friend is tripping on acid on the roof of a

93
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,080
building and thinks he can fly yes to be a friend to them is not to go yeah man go for it absolutely

94
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,440
it's to put your arm around the shoulder and say why don't we sit down over here and have a little

95
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,200
chat yes which I feel is kind of what you have been been doing in a way that takes it away also

96
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,120
from that the conflictual mode of engagement with the limits of science that doesn't that's a very

97
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:11,360
good vivid example I like and it's effectively the ancient saying Plato is my friend but a

98
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:19,520
greater friend is truth and you know so attributed to Aristotle probably wrongly

99
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:26,480
but it's that that if you are a friend of science and of reason you don't misrepresent it as something

100
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,560
that it isn't because that way you cause a false falling away from it from people who quite rightly

101
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:39,920
won't accept extreme the extreme positions the very black and white positions that reason

102
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
wrongly understood and science wrongly understood can adopt a sort of dogmatic position and dogma

103
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,040
is our enemy in whatever form it comes and in our world now there are far too many dogmas and

104
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,600
are too many things that can't be questioned and when you get to that point as Hannah Arendt said

105
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,560
if things can't be questioned you're in a tyranny so one of the things that I get to in thinking

106
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,520
about this is the relationship between what in my terms is knowledge and knowing

107
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,480
and obviously you know we talked about this last night science as a name for this set of

108
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,800
activities only came in around the 1830s prior to that the people who were doing what we think of

109
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,600
as science would have called themselves natural philosophers and in a sense that shift of name

110
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,560
is reflective of a moment in which a monopoly is being granted where this set of activities are

111
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:46,320
being seen and seeing themselves as the monopoly on knowing on the work of knowledge because that's

112
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:57,200
what science means what I found myself um thinking about is the place where maybe these scientists

113
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,800
who I was meeting in these rooms talking about climate change were stark is holding the knowledge

114
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,160
where knowledge is the kind of the fruits of these these activities but it's a kind of it's an arms

115
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,400
length thing and then there's another piece of work which is bringing the knowledge home and if

116
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,200
you think about the way in which the language of knowing I mean if we go to the Hebrew Bible for

117
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:28,080
example the word to know include can range from you know sexual intercourse to intellectual

118
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:38,240
apprehension or the fruit of the tree of knowledge in Genesis there is a there's a kind of dance for

119
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:48,320
me between you know the experience of knowing out of which I distill knowledge that can be shared

120
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,320
which includes the kinds that can be put in books and on shelves and then that dance is completed

121
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,480
at the moment where a reader brings their own experience to the words so as to bring them back

122
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,320
to life in their experience of knowing which will not mirror perfectly the experience of

123
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,680
knowing that led me to write it but it's a bit like two choreographers who use the same set of

124
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,800
choreographic notation the dance that the second choreographer will make from the notations of

125
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,040
the first will be recognizably akin to the first one and so there's this kind of three

126
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,360
three-way move of the experience of knowing the production of knowledge and then the experience

127
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,200
of knowing arising from encountering that which when I then read the master and his emissary felt

128
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:40,320
to me very close to the dance of the hemispheres that you're describing which was striking because

129
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,320
what I had been saying was I think we've got the a hierarchy where knowledge is held to be the

130
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,200
important bit rather than the experience of knowing that might be part of where we're

131
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,320
getting stuck part of the trouble we ran absolutely that's a very rich vein to mine

132
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,640
and as you know I sometimes contrast and I don't think it's exactly the same but the

133
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,920
difference is that we have in German and French for different kinds of knowledge so there's there's

134
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,960
Canon in German and Konnetto in French which means knowing from experience and there's

135
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:23,760
Wissen in German and Savoie in French which is to know as it were the facts and another way of

136
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:31,840
talking is that there is data there is information there is knowledge and there is understanding

137
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,800
and understanding is intelligence and it's what in fact whatever you do with AI but that's

138
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,320
another story you won't achieve that understanding because to have that understanding you have to

139
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,840
have lived an embodied life with emotions and and the body and all the the what we think of

140
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:58,720
as disadvantages that go with that so yes and the other thing is that what you describe is what has

141
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:08,160
been amusingly dubbed the McGillchrist manoeuvre which is which is my my theme that in all

142
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:16,640
understanding there is a three-step process the first take on anything as it were preconceptually

143
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:23,040
and as a whole is taken by the right hemisphere then at a subsequent stage it is broken down

144
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,600
categorized analyzed it's it's the bare bones of its structure were examined

145
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,920
but then all that knowledge needs to be taken back into the holistic picture of the right

146
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,560
hemisphere and absorbed there and become in a way implicit in that picture the easiest example I can

147
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,040
give is that of learning a piece of music but you're first attracted to it as a whole as you

148
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,000
start to play it you realize you have to practice certain passages and you start thinking intellectually

149
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,120
about the harmonic structure but when you go on stage to perform you must forget all that not

150
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,200
that it was wasted time it was very important time but that now it must be taken up into and become

151
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,160
implicit in the whole so I think that's I hope that something to do with what you were talking

152
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,360
about with knowledge the distinction of knowledge and knowing I mean perhaps interestingly knowledge

153
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:22,960
is is is a noun knowing is a verbal participle and you're what you're talking about is the

154
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:31,840
idea of something which is a lived experience yes yes exactly and one of the the things that

155
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,040
worries me about the ways in which we are responding to things like climate change

156
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,200
and actually I wonder if this thought might be extended even to the way in which we responded

157
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:49,280
to the pandemic is this sense of seeing the world through in your terms the left brain

158
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,440
perspective so that the world comes to be conceived of as a problem to be solved

159
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,920
that if we can just map if we can generate enough knowledge about how the world works

160
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,400
then we can come up with the set of solutions for managing the world as if the world is a thing

161
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,960
that needs to be turned into knowledge for its own good in order for it to continue to

162
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,720
have a chance of existing and I think that people can build very kind of convincing

163
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,720
arguments for what needs to be done that could actually lead us to very dystopian places

164
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,520
indeed and arguably yeah well and the the analogy which I get from my friend Paul Kingsnorth

165
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,680
he talks about all the things that he's learned from keeping a fish tank with a few

166
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:44,720
freshwater fish in it with his son and how this you know you have to measure the temperature it

167
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,880
can't get too hot can't get too cold you have a whole chemistry set of different things that you

168
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:56,000
have to drop into it to regulate it and all of this to do what a river or a lake does easily

169
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,640
and for free and my concern is that this left brain approach to the world when it is granted the

170
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,800
kind of dominance that it has had in modernity comes to can't see the difference between a fish

171
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:15,200
tank and a living world comes to represent the living world as if it were a fish tank and then

172
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,600
attempts to turn the world into a fish tank a thing that requires a total system of human

173
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:31,360
management and control yes again there's a there's a lot in that I think one being the difference

174
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:40,320
in scale which shouldn't superficially shouldn't make a difference but it does because what we're

175
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,320
dealing with in nature and what we're dealing with in human society and dealing with with

176
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:53,200
everything important in this world are complex systems not complicated systems and the distinction

177
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,720
being one which is effectively just like a large mechanical system the complicated system just takes

178
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,400
a bit few more arrows and a few more algorithms but the complex system is one that cannot

179
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,600
intrinsically be modeled in this way it has reentrant loops it has uncertainty involved in it

180
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:21,840
and so there is a grave danger that complex situations are resolved into a complicated

181
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:31,920
structure there was a hilarious piece of analysis carried out for the US army in Afghanistan by a

182
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,560
London consultancy firm and who generated a map of all that was going on in Afghanistan and it's

183
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:44,640
hilarious it's a huge map like this and it's got little centers everywhere and arrows going in every

184
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,120
possible direction and when this was presented to General McChrystal a man of experience an

185
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,760
amount of action he responded when we understand that we will have won the war which you can understand

186
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,760
stand in one of two possible ways and but what intrigues me actually is that at the moment

187
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:11,680
I've just been approached in the last couple of months quite independently by military intelligence

188
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,280
pooled between the UK the US and France and another approach from military intelligence

189
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:28,960
in Australia to help them untangle why their sort of systematic abstract ways of working

190
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,320
things out are not actually helpful and that we need to reincorporate into this something which is

191
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,960
less certain less tied down and if you make a structure too rigid and tighten up all the

192
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:52,080
bolts it's got no movement it will crash down so it needs to have this human intelligence in it

193
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,520
another way of putting it is that it needs to be antifragile in Talib's terms but we need to

194
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:08,160
reintroduce the much stigmatized concept of human judgment and intuition I love that story of the

195
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:17,840
map in Afghanistan it makes me think of Borges and the one-to-one map because sometimes it seems

196
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:26,800
as if that's the sort of the unintentional foolishness of this attempt to turn the world into a thing

197
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,760
that needs to be known in order to exist and the other example that was coming to mind as you were

198
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,800
speaking about it was Dean Bavington who's an environmental historian in Canada who comes from

199
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:46,080
Newfoundland and has written about the Newfoundland cod fishery and the story that he tells is

200
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,880
of how the Newfoundland cod fishery collapsed not once but twice and after the first collapse it

201
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:01,040
became the pioneering sort of case study of fisheries management where they were convinced

202
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,800
that they now had mapped and knew this wild fishery well enough to say when the boats could

203
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,960
go back out again how much fish they could take and through the 80s it was the world's leading

204
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:20,800
sustainable fishery and then in 92 it collapsed again and what he describes in fisheries science

205
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:29,200
is this kind of retreat then from attempting to know the wild living complex world to saying this

206
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,000
is beyond our capacity and so what we're going to do instead is move to fish farming where we create

207
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,880
deliberately simplified ecosystems that we can know and manage in this way that we failed to do

208
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,680
with the wild fishery and of course that is also failing because those systems are never really cut

209
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,920
off from the wild world they have inputs and outputs going into it but it seems like there's

210
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:02,800
a sort of spiral there which I see in various areas when we're talking about ecological crisis

211
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:10,560
which is this desire this feeling that we need to know the world in a way that would allow us to

212
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:18,000
intervene successfully in that way and then cycling between a despair at the failure to do that

213
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,720
and a sort of desperate optimism of trying to remake the world into something like a fish farm

214
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,200
and I think you know in what we've been talking about in the invitation that you're making in your

215
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:36,880
work I feel like there are clues for letting people know that you know the world might be

216
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:44,000
something other than the way it appears through this lens and therefore that the failure that

217
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,880
failing to make the world into something that can be known and managed in that way is not the end of

218
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:56,720
the world only at the end of a way of seeing it sure yes no that's that's surely right but I

219
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:04,240
suppose the difficulty would be how people can actually put that into practice that's always

220
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:11,760
the difficult bit yeah it's how do we have you thoughts about that well I think it starts with

221
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:19,040
giving up in a sense yeah yeah you know it starts with stopping it starts to stop into what you're

222
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,920
doing which is not working yeah yes and it was Gustavo Estavo who's a Mexican activist and thinker

223
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,800
who can really taught me this because he described how he'd had these three times in his life where

224
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,200
he had walked away from a situation without being able to explain why and the last time was in the

225
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,440
mid 70s when he turned down a job as a cabinet minister in Mexico and he said I couldn't explain

226
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,320
to anyone why or what I was going to do but in the way that he talked about it because he then

227
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,200
got involved with these grassroots networks and the the pueblos and the and the barrios of Mexico

228
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:03,440
city and it was the until he left that position where he was standing he couldn't see what was

229
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,120
invisible from there he had to actually go somewhere else without being able to give anyone

230
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:16,560
a justification of this move for things to come into view because the way that the people he was

231
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:22,080
then working with were seen from above from within the system he'd been working in missed something

232
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,320
important about their ability to make life go on so that's the first step of giving up not as an end

233
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,720
but as a necessary I say in the book you know giving up is always giving up on something

234
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:41,280
though it may feel like everything until after you've done it so that's the sort of the first

235
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:50,080
move is to stop um stop trying to save the world as we have known it but also stop assuming that

236
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,840
if you give up on that then you know how the story ends yes well that wouldn't particularly we don't

237
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:03,200
do as Anne Whitehead said um profits uh we don't know what to do with them perhaps taking them

238
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,800
outside and stoning them in some sort of merciful kind of way which is best but when everyone's

239
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,880
asked to predict the future um I sort of think of Neil Spore saying prediction is a particularly

240
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,360
difficult matter especially when it concerns the future so I don't think we ever know and

241
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,520
keeping that space open about what is going to happen is very important and the failure to do so

242
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,080
is is all part of this we must have certainty we must follow this path we know what will happen

243
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:39,040
we usually won't be following that path something we didn't know happens like the famous um economic

244
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:48,240
collapse of 2008-9 um where we thought we had now mapped how these markets work so successfully

245
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,680
that they would never crash again and they promptly crashed too the difficulty is taking

246
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,960
something that works as I mentioned earlier on a small scale and I'm trying to suggest

247
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,040
that this is going to work on a larger one for example if you do have a complex system which

248
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:13,840
can't be reduced to um mechanistic uh chains of causation you can nonetheless find a very small

249
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,600
isolated part of it where it appears that that's what's happening and you can hone in on that and

250
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,520
you can see a little chain of causation and you can interfere with it and produce a result and the

251
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,560
temptation is for science there to say so we understand that now but what you've understood is

252
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,360
how that little chain of causation there worked but you haven't understood the nature of the

253
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:43,120
hole in which it inheres and and so when one's zooming out from some small scale experiment

254
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,120
usually the thing is quite different problem when you are looking at um the hole in which

255
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,640
whatever it was you modeled along so the there's a distinction that I use in the book between

256
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,920
which came to me from John Michael Greer and it's the distinction between a problem and a predicament

257
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:05,200
okay and he says you know a problem has a solution and the thought experiment he gives

258
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,960
is he says so suppose that you can get in a time machine and go back to some a prosperous rural

259
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,560
village in the south of England in 1700 equipped with the knowledge of the industrial revolution

260
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,920
that is coming and everything that that is going to mean for the people there and suppose that you

261
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,760
can actually convince them of all of these things that are going to completely disrupt

262
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,200
their ways of life and for a small number of people going to make them amazingly rich off

263
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,920
things that no one's dreamed of yet and for many others mean life in factories or going off to

264
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:44,240
fight foreign wars and then they say to you so what should we do and there's no answer to that

265
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,160
because it's not a it's not a problem that can be solved it's a predicament okay which mean doesn't

266
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,640
mean that there aren't responses doesn't mean that there aren't actions worth taking and some of those

267
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,720
will be wiser than others but you know the world that's born out of that which is the world of

268
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,360
industrial modernity of the last couple of hundred years that we've been talking about has been better

269
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:14,240
at solving problems than any human culture that the world has ever seen but increasingly over time

270
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,560
more and more of the problems it's faced with are the consequences of earlier solutions exactly

271
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,360
and meanwhile it almost can't see that some things might not be problems that there might

272
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,560
be predicaments and that another way of seeing and acting might be called for in the face of a

273
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:38,400
predicament what would that way of acting involve well suspending the belief that you

274
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:44,400
can solve this now should be an important part of it so a good example of a predicament that we

275
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:51,360
almost still recognize as a predicament would be mortality you know when we meet somebody i remember

276
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,160
meeting someone who was a who had his membership card of the cryogenics institute okay with the

277
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,640
instructions on the back if you know if you find me dead then put ice around my head and call this

278
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:07,280
number yeah and uh i mean i shook his hand and it felt like the coldness was sort of creeping

279
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:15,440
back into him even while he was alive but most of us kind of at a gut level see that as a category

280
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,240
error we see the fact that we're going to die one day is more more like a predicament than

281
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,760
a problem to be solved and it doesn't cancel out the meaning of the fact that we're sitting here

282
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,000
alive now it doesn't remove there being lots of things we can do with the life that we have

283
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,040
but if our response to the fact that we're going to die one day is to try and throw ourselves

284
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:45,200
into treating that as a problem to be solved then that may not lead us to make the wisest use of the

285
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,640
time that we have indeed there's a further step we could take which is not only not to see it as a

286
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:58,000
problem but perhaps not even to see it as a predicament but to see it as an inalienable part

287
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:07,200
of life and something that has its strength too i mean if you take i was very impressed by

288
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,800
something that mary midgley said when she was 92 and i think she died when she was 96 and she was

289
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:25,520
extremely sharp until the moment she died and she she said it's very easy to come to terms with death

290
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:31,440
because one only has to ask the question what would it be like if you literally could live on

291
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:39,120
this earth forever and i'm sure there may be some people somewhere who say oh marvellous but most

292
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:47,040
of us begin to feel a sort of craziness and almost a sense of panic that there is no end to this

293
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:56,560
and if that is the case that it's better that it has its its finite nature it has its finest

294
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:05,280
then it's only a question of when and nowadays we always think a bigger portion is better but

295
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,680
sometimes there's something quite good about the standard portion of a human life as i find myself

296
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:21,840
three school years and nine at the moment i feel quite happy with the idea and i think that i really

297
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:31,840
think that the lack of our awareness of death and what it brings to the picancy of life is is a great

298
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:43,680
loss and in the past of course people would have had a scholar such as i might have had a

299
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,280
skull on the table that reminded me from my twenties onwards that i was going to die and

300
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,960
that this had meaning and once you once you accept this and you don't see it as the enemy of life

301
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:02,480
but part of the nature of life as i think the chinese the far eastern tradition chinese and

302
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,000
japanese are much better at saying that the transiency of things is not a problem to be

303
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,560
solved not even a predicament this is in fact something very beautiful and part of their meaning

304
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:24,000
it's a sentence without a full stop on the end has a problem yes and i'm reminded of the story of

305
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,440
Beethoven before he went deaf hearing somebody in a neighboring room playing a piece as far as the

306
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,040
last note in the scale and not actually going there having to go out to press the note before he could

307
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:44,080
go back to bed the line when paul and i wrote the dark mountain manifesto the line that has

308
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,680
stayed with me most deeply is right at the end when we found ourselves saying the end of the

309
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:57,840
world as we know it is not the end of the world full stop and together we will find the hope beyond

310
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:03,600
hope the path that lead into the unknown world that lies ahead and a year or two after we wrote that

311
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,040
i found myself sitting with the philosopher david abram talking about this and in that

312
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,640
conversation a new turn on that came out which was the end of the world as we know it is also the

313
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,920
end of a way of knowing the world and so i think that's what i'm kind of that's what i'm inquiring

314
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,000
into and and i feel like you're one of the people who's kind of holding that question at the moment

315
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,640
well it is wonderful to to to have that expressed because the the idea of the way in which we know

316
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:44,880
something affecting what it is is absolutely central to to my philosophy and which is why i pay

317
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:52,480
so much attention to attention and the importance of how we attend not just whether or not we attend

318
00:35:52,480 --> 00:36:00,080
which is important but how we attend by which of course i don't mean the means by which but the

319
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:07,680
way in which and that changes the nature of the world and i believe that actually once one starts

320
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:14,720
looking at the world with a different kind of attention it can change its nature quite quickly

321
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,120
and quite responsibly that has been my experience so we don't have to people often say so what do

322
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:26,720
we do in a way that's a sort of secondary left hemisphere question now we've got a vision of

323
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,440
how we want to do things what are the steps we need to take to accomplish it

324
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,680
and the left hemisphere servant should say well i will go and do this and you say that's a very

325
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,480
good idea and so forth but really what we're talking about is inhabiting our lives inhabiting the

326
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,720
world inhabiting the cosmos in a different way which depends on the nature of the attention

327
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,000
which means a relationship because attention is never a camera doesn't pay attention

328
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:04,080
a microphone doesn't pay attention it receives and we don't just receive we pay attention and that

329
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,360
means that we bring something of our own to whatever it is that we encounter but i also

330
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:16,320
profoundly believe that that's something else responds to our attention i don't never have

331
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:23,920
believed since i was you know a young adolescent that it was true that the world was a sort of

332
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,560
heap of non responsive material it always seems to me to be vibrantly communicating with me and

333
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,520
and that there is this exchange all the time so it out of that exchange comes what is real because

334
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,520
i do believe and i argue philosophically for those who can't see why on earth i would say that

335
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,160
in in the matter with things that relationships are primary that what actually exists first of all

336
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:59,360
is relationship and that the things are secondary to the relationships so when there are relationships

337
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,640
bits start to stand out and we go oh there's something a thing and that's what we identify

338
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:14,560
but it's a web of relationships when you think about how an embryo develops into the animal

339
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:24,000
it doesn't add a liver and a heart and a spina whatever it these things come out of the hole

340
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,160
and they only are embedded in that context of the hole and then they stand out and you go what's that

341
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:37,120
over there we'll call that the liver you know so in an organism there are areas of relationship

342
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:44,640
which become what we then call things and this is quite coherent with um something that means

343
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:52,160
intuitively something to me but is part of all the great so-called wisdom traditions of the world

344
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:59,280
that whatever we mean by god that first grounding whatever that encompasses it all

345
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,960
is that its nature is love i mean that is a common theme of all these traditions

346
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,720
and love is nothing if it's not a relationship that's exactly what it is it doesn't exist

347
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:21,760
but you know you don't have to things first love exists and out of love come the beings and i believe

348
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:31,840
that the the purpose of this is getting a long way out perhaps but and i think that the purpose of

349
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,200
the cosmos one might say why why if there is this ground of being whatever you like to call it the

350
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:51,440
Tao or god or whatever else why did it bother to create and i think the answer is that it itself

351
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,440
only becomes fulfilled through this act of creation because there's another and there is a reciprocity

352
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,640
so that reciprocity between the divine and ourselves is usually important not just for us

353
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,280
but also for the divine which means that we also play a crucial role in it we're not just passive

354
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,840
observers once again like the camera or whatever we are making ourselves and we are forging the

355
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:26,560
reality of the universe by our responsiveness and that helps to explain why things evolve

356
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:34,160
in the way that they have done why why was the first as we believe in animacy and how did animacy

357
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:40,560
come about and why was why has this animacy taken the form that it has of developing creatures like

358
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:47,280
ourselves who are in many ways so much shorter lived and more vulnerable than ancient creatures

359
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,960
way back down this phylogenetic tree and there are examples of actinobacteria in the depths of the

360
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:01,040
ocean single celled organisms that are themselves over 100 million years old so a 70 year life seems

361
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:08,080
like what's that achieved i think the whole drive of it is towards differentiation the unfolding

362
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:13,760
like the bud that unfolds and it's not the negation of the bud that it turns into a flower it's the

363
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,720
fulfillment of the bud that it turns into the flower and the flower eventually to the fruit so

364
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,000
all these things that's an image of course from Hegel but that idea that things are fulfilled

365
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,280
through their unfolding their individuation without that threatening the integrity of the whole is

366
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:39,040
very important and this process leads through life to two important things one is our greater

367
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:49,040
responsiveness and the other is a much rapider rate of response as a whole as a species or

368
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:57,360
or even as an individual to the world both a more rapid ability to respond and a far more

369
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:04,640
intense and wide ranging response so a vole may well appreciate the things in the garden that

370
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,480
i appreciate at some level but there are certainly things that i can see and appreciate as a human

371
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,360
that that vole can't which is not to say that the vole doesn't have things that it appreciates that

372
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:26,160
i don't take and that's granted but what we bring to the party is our greater response which includes

373
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:33,040
things like writing the mass in b minor and and this is an extraordinary response to the creation

374
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:38,080
people sometimes talk about it as though well yes but it's so tragic you know we're tragically

375
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:43,520
cast into this pointless meaningless universe and our response is to do this but this is

376
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,720
this is back to front that that thing came out of the universe by willingness to listen to it by

377
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:57,040
willingness to write what i write vast willingness to write what he wrote all these things come out

378
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,000
of the cosmos they can't come from anywhere else so they're in a sense things that are unpacked

379
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,120
that are potential in it so there is no chasm between us and this cosmos and it only looks

380
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:16,400
like it has no meaning and no awareness because science at some stage in the last couple of

381
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:24,240
hundred years decided that it would make a simple principle that it was not going to consider anything

382
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,800
that suggested either purpose or responsiveness and and and anything that couldn't be measured and

383
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:39,680
wasn't material and so at the end of its elaborate process it solemnly pronounces i can't find any

384
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,440
purpose or or any any evidence that consciousness can be real i mean there really are people tenured

385
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,400
professors in western universities who hold the belief that consciousness is an illusion but you

386
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:59,440
know consciousness for there to be an illusion there has to be consciousness and it seems like the

387
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,440
invitation that is contained in this end of the world as we know it with all of the

388
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:14,080
the the harm and damage that is unfolding that is also the end of a way of knowing the world is

389
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:19,360
an invitation back in an invitation back into relation absolutely back into participating

390
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:25,280
in the world as we always were anyway rather than pretending that we're standing above it and knowing

391
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:30,560
it and managing it absolutely that is so true and really what i'm saying is that

392
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:37,760
something as simple as practicing changing the way in which you attend to things changes the world

393
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:45,200
and changes you and obviously changes for the better a relationship if you can pay appropriate

394
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,640
kinds of attention and of course everything involves a different kind of attention there's a kind of

395
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,560
attention that is detached and is entirely appropriate that for example the surgeon who's

396
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:03,040
carrying out a delicate operation and simply has to treat the body as not that person that will

397
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:11,040
wake up from the operation in order to be able to do his or her job efficiently so different kinds

398
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,240
of attention are important and they bring us back into connection with something surprisingly quickly

399
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:23,680
and so when people sort of despair about what is happening those who wish to find

400
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:32,080
can find quite quickly what it is that they're seeking and it may be a problem or predicament

401
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:38,400
that many people won't survive that that is always going to be a possibility maybe our

402
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,680
civilization won't survive maybe it will maybe it will in a in a in a wiser form in a less arrogant

403
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:53,440
and hubristic form on a much more local level and a much more coherent and interconnected way

404
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,560
we don't know but this this business of being taken back into relationship and this

405
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,840
receptive this giving and this taking which is so fundamental this can be achieved

406
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,000
i'm thinking of an italian philosopher Federico Campania whose work i got to know while i was

407
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,920
working on this book and he he has a lovely way of putting it he says sometimes you are

408
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,240
born into the ending of a world this is the thing that has happened before exactly and the way that

409
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,240
you diagnose this is that the future no longer works because what we ordinarily are talking

410
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,760
about when we talk about the future is an extension of a story that we were born into

411
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,880
and if you've been born into the ending of that story then attempts to extend it no longer

412
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,440
convince anyone and i think a lot of what we've been witnessing around the world in the last 10

413
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,880
years or so is the political manifestation of the failure of the future and the appeal of the past

414
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,760
is so powerful in politics today attempts to invoke the future don't work in the way they

415
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:02,160
did in the mid 20th century because this world is in some sense coming to an end so what Campania

416
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,200
says is so if it is your discernment that you have been born into the ending of the world that you

417
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,880
were born into what's worth doing and he says well you can stop trying to make sense according to

418
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:19,040
the logic of the world that is coming to an end and start trying to create good ruins things that

419
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,640
may turn out to be helpful to the people beyond the end of this world to those who have to make

420
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:30,560
life work among all of the things that will be left behind and carried forwards but understood

421
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:36,560
perhaps in very different ways after this particular story that we happened to be born

422
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,600
somewhere late in has come to an end and i feel like maybe that's what we're trying to do

423
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:47,680
as thinkers as writers as artists right now in networks like dark mountain is to make good

424
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:53,120
ruins things that may turn out to be fertile and full of possibility after the failure of the

425
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:59,760
future that we were promised that's wonderful and i suppose what it suggests is that we don't

426
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,680
by any means give up on the future we just give up on the future as a projection of

427
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:13,840
the way we've been doing things exactly and and that that's um a hopeful idea it's a very

428
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:20,880
profoundly productive idea if it can be embraced and again one has to accept

429
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,240
limits and mortality is one of them and the civilization has some mortality as well in fact

430
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,160
they tend to thrive for a few hundred years probably 300 400 years and then they tend to

431
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:44,080
decay wherever they have been and so we have to accept that there is limitation but the left

432
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:54,240
hemisphere absolutely rejects any idea of boundaries limitations finiteness and the simplest example

433
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:01,120
is that it will absolutely deny that there is anything wrong with it although it has the person

434
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:07,520
has a paralyzed left arm perhaps the whole side of their body they'll just deny that it exists

435
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:14,320
rather than accept that there could be a problem or a limit it's always going for we can do away

436
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:20,000
with the limits the boundaries and a lot of what is wrong with us now is we knew no limits there

437
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,120
were no limits to what we thought we could do and the world would still carry on being okay

438
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:31,840
this turned out to be predictably actually um a very stupid thing to believe and i can't really

439
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:39,280
imagine why people still carry on with a philosophy which is all about trying to

440
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,680
dispense with what they see as the limits on being whatever we want and doing whatever we want

441
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:53,200
so how do we help the left hemisphere at that point where it's stuck in that limitlessness

442
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:59,040
what what are the moves i mean i think that's what you're doing as a writer it's as difficult as

443
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:06,640
how god could have helped satan in paradise lost lucifer the brightest and best of his angels

444
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:15,760
became this grungy competitive force and this is really an introspective understanding as there

445
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:21,680
is in so many mythologies of an overseeing power that understands and a part of it that thinks it

446
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,120
knows but doesn't and that tries to use up the power so it's a very difficult thing to do however

447
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:33,920
there are a couple of things that work in our favor and and the first is that we can we can see what

448
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:40,400
is happening i believe that the left hemisphere is predominant and that this is damaging for a whole

449
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:47,440
range of reasons since it is less understanding and less intelligent and it's a way of going can't

450
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:56,000
be sustained and and that means that we can actively favor what the right hemisphere is

451
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:04,240
we can make a point of listening to understanding and directing our efforts towards receiving

452
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:10,880
what is the right hemisphere can can tell us and give to us and the other is that the left

453
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:17,120
hemisphere is rather like in the emperor with with no clothes on that it sort of believes that

454
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:23,920
it's marvelous and finest on and suddenly you see how pathetic it is and and that that itself is

455
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,680
wonderfully liberating insight that we don't have to be tyrannized by this this voice that says

456
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:35,040
we're clever we understand it all it's all mechanical we know it we can just say but actually

457
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,720
that's hilarious it's just there's something about laughter in the middle of all this i hope so

458
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,400
this takes me back to the the way that i've thought about knowledge and knowing

459
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,040
because the example i always use to talk about this sort of threshold between the arm's length

460
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,200
knowledge and the experience of knowing is i say think about the moment when you get a joke

461
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:00,960
you don't have any information that you didn't have the moment before but you see something

462
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:08,240
differently and it will affect you emotionally intellectually bodily and it that's the simplest

463
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:14,400
version of the kinds of encounter the kinds of being pulled across a threshold out of the trap

464
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:23,280
that that we need holy i agree and and i think that humor and the great humorists are up there in

465
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,240
they're up there in my pantheon along with the great poets because what they're doing is just

466
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:34,000
that a poet doesn't as you were tell you things you didn't know but it helps you to see things

467
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,600
that you thought you'd seen but you didn't really appreciate understand or feel and that is profoundly

468
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:48,320
moving and humor is in another way the achievement of this kind of an insight through what they have

469
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:54,000
in common from a sorry to refer to the brain here but what they have in common is that both of

470
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:01,360
these things depend very largely on the right frontal cortex which can understand implicit

471
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:08,800
meaning multiple meaning and tone and all these things that modify meaning which are present

472
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:14,080
in poetry and are present in humor and you know one of the things we absolutely have got to do

473
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:19,600
is to liberate humor again and and say no it's not good enough to say people can't make jokes

474
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:25,600
about things they can make jokes about anything and if you don't like it you know that's for you

475
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:32,880
to sort out so it's as if the the left hemisphere like applying all of this back to the the predicament

476
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,840
or problem or whatever it is of the trouble that the world is in not least in terms of climate

477
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:45,760
change left hemisphere wants to design a way out of that to come up with a plan that will somehow

478
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:52,480
allow us to you know reboot the future to have some extension of the world as we have known it

479
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,480
and the invitation is somehow to stumble into another way of being human together to stumble

480
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,400
into another chapter of the story rather than to design and plan it out on a spreadsheet and

481
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,880
implement it in the world yes and that stumble of course is the way the left hemisphere would

482
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:16,080
think of it that it's a stumble but actually what it is is quite probably a wise move that

483
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:22,080
comes from our unconscious and what you're really pointing to is that having everything

484
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:28,400
consciously planned out is not the way to achieve everything in life it's the way to achieve the

485
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:36,400
solution to various incredibly circumscribed problems it's been estimated that 99.5% at least

486
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:44,000
of everything that we know as it were with our body with our with our brain is not in the focus

487
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,840
of our consciousness but because of that it can be much much richer and there's an argument for

488
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:56,960
saying that it's something damaging about making things explicit and and focus because you limit

489
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:04,240
them to one single simple idea that has to be pursued whereas in the implicit understanding

490
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:10,400
of a situation one can with enormous economy bring together a whole lot of different

491
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:17,360
elements that come out of the field of one's experience out of being alive and bring them

492
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,880
to bear and you know here again I just I often quote this but I think it's so mildless and

493
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,480
Whitehead said two things he said that a civilisation advances according to the number of

494
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:36,480
actions and thoughts that can be taken care of outside of the glare of experience and the other

495
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:45,440
was that applying thought is like a cavalry charge in battle it's something that can only

496
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:52,320
been done occasionally is very expensive and requires fresh horses so you can't just be doing

497
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:58,000
this all the time in fact in a way what one would say is that when only brings this cumbersome

498
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,680
mechanism of you know focusing on it in the full glare of the spotlight and trying to solve a

499
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:10,880
problem when there is a problem but when things are running well you shouldn't be bringing that glare

500
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,240
to bear on it because you will freeze it much as if the pianist starts to remember his fingers

501
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:22,720
while playing then have to stop playing and if the problem is actually the estate of frozenness

502
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,320
then you can't attack it with the with the back kind of cavalry charge

503
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:35,600
yes but also what I was thinking is that when you are focusing on it then you are likely to

504
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:47,840
either stumble or march whereas when you are not focused on it it's not so much that you will

505
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:54,240
stumble but you will be guided by something that if you trusted not uncritically and not

506
00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:00,160
without a dialogue with yourself often not the conscious one about what are you doing but you

507
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:06,480
will be guided by something which is different from what your immediate analysis at the conscious

508
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,520
level would suggest was the way to do it the stumble becomes a dance becomes more of a dance

509
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:19,200
a step in a dance or something of the kind that comes out of one naturally and I think we all

510
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:25,040
have the experience don't we of knowing when that happens that I always think of it in relation to

511
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:33,040
music that if on occasion one dances well and joyously it's because one's not trying to dance

512
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:39,040
at all but the dance is happening in you and through you and the music too that music plays

513
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:45,840
itself through you not you play the music so one more layer as we maybe draw this conversation to

514
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:53,760
a close that's coming to mind for me is this thing that I've been describing as a sort of left

515
00:57:53,760 --> 00:58:00,640
hemisphere attempt to to map and respond to the trouble that the world is in I think that a lot

516
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:06,000
of those who in good faith are kind of describing and telling us what we need to do about the situation

517
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,800
in these terms it seems to me that they have a map in which the thing that the left hemisphere sees

518
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:19,840
or this this way of seeing and describing the world that is kind of through calculative measurement

519
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:25,920
and that kind of reason that this addresses the deep level of reality and then the things that

520
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,240
we're talking about that we might associate with the right hemisphere you know poetry and

521
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:35,600
humor music they'll say well all of that stuff is lovely and it's this thing that becomes possible

522
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,560
once the people who think like us have done the hard work of making sure there is a platform

523
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:47,920
underneath it yes and it's almost as if I've noticed this even amongst novelists there is an

524
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:55,840
attempt to resolve Snow's two cultures dilemma from the mid 20th century by staging a marriage

525
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:05,280
between the two cultures in which the you know the scientific side plays the husband and the arts or

526
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,360
other ways of knowing play the wife and so they're they're held to be kind of beautiful

527
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,520
entertaining decorative they make the world a better place we wouldn't want the world without them

528
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:22,320
but it's a good job we have the practical you see the the stereotypes that this is based on and it

529
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:30,240
seems to me that that then as things get difficult the people who are who have staged that kind of

530
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:37,280
way of seeing things go well now it's time to now it's time for the hard serious stuff which

531
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:44,160
requires us to go into the the left brain mode and of course what you're suggesting and I would

532
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:50,560
say is that this is quite the opposite it's the upside down story yes and it reminds me of the

533
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:59,760
image of somebody who after an evening hard work in the city goes to Covent Garden to amuse themselves

534
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:05,680
watching the magic flute and they see that real life is the hard stuff of working at Goldman Sachs

535
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:11,920
but all this stuff is in the evening from Mozart it's just a decoration but of course it's entirely

536
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,760
the other way around that that is the only chance this person is going to have that sort of thing

537
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:23,200
to bring them into touch with reality and what they're doing in that office under strict lighting

538
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:31,200
he said this is a fantasy and not necessarily a harmless one so I absolutely agree with that

539
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,400
and it's the story the left hemisphere tells that it is doing the hard work and it's the one

540
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,200
that was sold to me as a medical student you know it was almost as though the right hemisphere we

541
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,960
don't really know what it's there for but perhaps it's there to prop up the left hemisphere so it

542
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:52,560
doesn't fall over but everything important was done by the left hemisphere but this is not the case

543
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:59,360
and your example of the magic flute for some reason calls to mind for me the most powerful

544
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:07,200
experience of this inversion of the stories of reality which was you know when my son was born

545
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,280
and beforehand I was working at the Swedish National Theatre at the time and my boss who

546
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,560
was about five years older than me had a couple of young children he said birth is the most animal

547
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:24,160
experience you'll ever be part of and he was of course completely right about that but the bit

548
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:31,040
I was less prepared for was it was also the most mythic experience that the temporality of that

549
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:37,200
journey through birth and the turns within the journey was absolutely something that was familiar

550
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,280
to me from you know the terrain of fairy tale and mythic story and the kinds of journey that's

551
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:52,240
being staged in the magic flute that oh somehow the the kind of again the linear accountancy

552
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:57,280
version of time is not the thing that's there underneath not the thing we encounter when we're

553
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,880
there with the blood of birth or death but actually in those moments we're not just we're

554
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:09,120
simultaneously drawn into the fact that we have always all along been animals and that to be an

555
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:14,800
animal is to live in dream time and myth time more than to live in the kinds of time that you know

556
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:20,160
the guys under the strip lighting in the city office or lots of the ways that we do science or

557
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:28,640
talk about science imply is they the true real there yes I suppose it's that these existential

558
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:36,240
encounters of birth and death that we realize that time isn't the I think it's very real but it

559
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,720
isn't it's not like science science is very real and important but isn't necessarily the way it's

560
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:47,840
now conceived and time is other than the way it is now conventionally conceived and that would take

561
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:53,760
us a long time I have a chapter in the matter of things solely on time and the ways in which the

562
01:02:53,760 --> 01:03:02,000
hemispheres see it but I really like that and this idea of a process struck me very forcibly

563
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:12,480
because when my third child was born my mother was dying and my mother was at one part of the M3

564
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:20,720
and my wife was in the labor suite in Winchester and I had to consult with the

565
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:29,600
obstetrical team and take time to go up the motorway say goodbye to my mother and come back

566
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:36,400
to see my daughter born so you can imagine the strange experience of that and the emotions and

567
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:48,960
the sense of being in a non bureaucratic time so yeah well thank you Ian I hope that conversations

568
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:55,440
like this provide sort of strange little openings or doorways through which people have a chance

569
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:02,080
of stumbling into another way of seeing where we find ourselves and we're blinding yes dancing

570
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:12,720
in there another way thank you very much it's been lovely do go talking
