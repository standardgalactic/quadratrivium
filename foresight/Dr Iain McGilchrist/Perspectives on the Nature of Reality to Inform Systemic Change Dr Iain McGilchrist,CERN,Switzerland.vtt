00:00.000 --> 00:10.720
What am I going to do this evening? I'm going to try to do the impossible. In the old days,

00:10.720 --> 00:15.280
students used to have nothing very much to do at university, so they used to entertain themselves

00:15.280 --> 00:19.520
with pranks, like how many people can you fit into a telephone box? And it's going to be a

00:19.520 --> 00:25.520
little bit like that tonight. I'm going to see how many ideas I can cram into whatever time has

00:25.520 --> 00:32.880
allowed me. I want to begin by talking a bit about what I call the hemisphere hypothesis,

00:34.240 --> 00:41.760
the question of the difference between the hemispheres, but mainly as a portal to a further

00:41.760 --> 00:49.920
exploration of reality. It seems to me that at the moment we're puzzled about reality because

00:50.240 --> 00:57.840
there are messages that come to us, particularly from some areas of postmodernism, that there is no

00:57.840 --> 01:03.520
such thing as truth. Everything is just whatever you make up. I don't believe that for an instant.

01:03.520 --> 01:10.640
I believe passionately that we are truths. They are rarely simple and they may sometimes conflict

01:10.640 --> 01:17.840
with one another. So it is hard to set up a program of them, but we can learn to look for them and be

01:17.840 --> 01:25.200
more successful in finding them. And it's in that project that I've been writing for 30 years,

01:25.840 --> 01:30.320
first the master and his emissary, and then the matter with things which came out a couple of

01:30.320 --> 01:38.720
years ago. Well, less than that now, November 21. And in it I try to take strands from what we know

01:38.720 --> 01:46.800
about the brain, what we know about our thinking patterns in consciousness, and what we know from

01:46.800 --> 01:54.240
physics. These seem like three pretty core ways of looking into the nature of reality. I'm not

01:54.240 --> 02:01.040
suggesting there is one single easy reality. I'm not suggesting there is one ever-knowable truth.

02:01.040 --> 02:08.720
I'm suggesting we mustn't ever give up on the idea that it is worthwhile for a human life. In fact,

02:08.720 --> 02:16.160
it is imperative for a human life to be searching for such a reality and such a truth. Otherwise,

02:16.160 --> 02:23.280
we are frankly deluded. And I believe that much of the world I now live in is

02:23.280 --> 02:32.480
suicidally deluded. But I come on to that later. Now, let me see. Oh, that's good. So this is a

02:32.480 --> 02:38.560
quote from Pascal. The twofold nature of man is so evident that some have thought that we had two

02:38.560 --> 02:45.280
souls. But he's not the only person to have said something like this. Kant said something like

02:45.280 --> 02:54.720
this Schopenhauer, Bergson, Goethe, Nietzsche, the wonderful German philosopher Max SchÃ¤ler,

02:54.720 --> 03:02.560
who in my view is underrated and underread these days. They all had this instinct that there were

03:02.560 --> 03:08.960
two sort of almost people or points of view within us that were somewhat in conflict. Each could be

03:09.760 --> 03:15.760
helpful for some things, but neither of them was complete in themselves. And in fact, incidentally,

03:15.760 --> 03:20.880
in writing this book, I found that there are stories like the story of the master and his

03:20.880 --> 03:27.680
emissary, which gave me the title of my earlier book 2009 from all around the world. The story I

03:27.680 --> 03:33.360
took there was supposed to resituate the way in which we think about the left and right hemisphere.

03:33.360 --> 03:38.240
When I was in medical school, it was said that the left hemisphere sort of was terribly important

03:38.240 --> 03:43.520
because it controls the right hand with which you do the grasping, and it controls certain elements

03:43.520 --> 03:51.040
of language, mainly speech, through which we say we grasp things. But actually, it turns out that

03:51.040 --> 03:58.080
the right hemisphere is far, far more important for getting a hold on the world than the left

03:58.080 --> 04:02.560
hemisphere. And indeed, when people have had a stroke, it is harder for them to recover from

04:02.560 --> 04:07.360
a stroke in the right hemisphere than a stroke in the left hemisphere, even though the left

04:07.360 --> 04:14.320
hemisphere's stroke often affects their speech and affects their ability to use their right hand.

04:16.080 --> 04:24.960
So, I could say at this point that in the later book that I've written, The Mashable Things,

04:24.960 --> 04:30.880
which came out, as I say, November 21, I begin by looking at what I call the various portals

04:30.880 --> 04:38.560
through which we can get a grasp of the world at all, get some kind of understanding of it,

04:38.560 --> 04:44.560
receive information from it. And I take it that those are attention, perception, which is not

04:44.560 --> 04:50.400
the same as attention, judgment, the ideas we form on the basis of what we attend to and what we

04:50.400 --> 04:56.880
perceive, emotional and social intelligence, cognitive intelligence, in other words, IQ,

04:57.760 --> 05:03.280
and creativity, because that enters into our ability to interpret what it is we're seeing.

05:03.280 --> 05:10.960
And in all of these, I demonstrate at length, over 400 pages, and I draw on 5,600 pieces of

05:10.960 --> 05:15.920
research, I can demonstrate conclusively that all of these are better carried out by the right

05:15.920 --> 05:21.760
hemisphere. It is more veridical, it is more intelligent, more perceptive, and much better

05:21.760 --> 05:25.600
guide to reality. And when people have right hemisphere, damages has been commented on by

05:25.600 --> 05:31.600
neurologists over the Easter century, they lose any sense of reality, they become deluded,

05:31.600 --> 05:38.560
start hallucinating. And indeed, in schizophrenia, which is the topic that probably rings bells for

05:38.560 --> 05:43.680
most people when one mentions delusions and hallucinations, what is going on there is something

05:43.680 --> 05:50.640
like a defunct or deficient right hemisphere, which has been compensated for by an overactive

05:50.640 --> 05:57.680
left hemisphere. Anyway, that's all by way of an introduction. But first of all, let me just ask

05:57.680 --> 06:02.800
this question, most of you here will have heard something like this, what hemisphere differences,

06:02.800 --> 06:08.400
that's all complete rubbish, that was all blown out of the water 30 years ago, it's all nonsense,

06:08.400 --> 06:14.240
don't even listen to it. And there's a sort of circular thing that happens here, this is what

06:14.240 --> 06:19.120
people were taught, so they never looked, because they never looked, they never found anything

06:19.120 --> 06:23.920
different from what they've been told. So much later in their careers, they don't want to spend 30

06:23.920 --> 06:28.400
years like me actually finding out what are the differences between the hemispheres, because it

06:28.400 --> 06:32.160
would mean the end of their career, they'd be despised by their colleagues, they wouldn't get

06:32.160 --> 06:39.760
promotion. So I'm afraid this is a question of a, and what you might call an urban myth,

06:40.480 --> 06:46.320
it is an idea that itself needs powerfully to be debunked. If you don't believe me,

06:46.320 --> 06:52.720
read my work, it is enormously well referenced, you can look up everywhere what it is that I'm

06:52.720 --> 06:58.160
referring to, and why it is scientifically based. I'd just like to ask you three simple questions,

06:58.160 --> 07:04.800
why is the brain divided? This is a picture by the Salius, and we were in Basel the other day,

07:04.800 --> 07:12.240
and passed by accident a house, it said here lived the Salius. So in 1542, this slightly grumpy looking

07:12.240 --> 07:18.480
man had the top of his head lifted off, and here you see the left hemisphere pushed slightly to

07:18.480 --> 07:23.600
decide to expose this band of fibres at the base of the brain called the corpus callosum.

07:24.560 --> 07:30.320
Why is the brain divided in this way? If the power of the brain is in making connections,

07:30.320 --> 07:36.160
why have it so massively divided? And it's not just our brains, by the way, it's all the brains

07:36.160 --> 07:41.200
we've ever looked at, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, right down to insects having separate

07:41.200 --> 07:47.760
different ganglions. Wherever you look, and in fact, the oldest creature that we know has a neural

07:47.760 --> 07:54.240
network, which is said to be the ancestor of the mammalian brain, a sea creature called nematosella

07:54.240 --> 08:00.960
vectensis, the brain is the neural network is somewhat divided and asymmetrical, which is the

08:00.960 --> 08:06.000
next thing I'm coming on to. Why is the brain asymmetrical? Here you're looking up at the base

08:06.000 --> 08:10.880
of the brain, as if you were looking up your own spinal column, and you can see that the

08:11.840 --> 08:19.200
right hemisphere, which is hopefully on the left, is larger than the corresponding frontal

08:19.200 --> 08:24.160
layer of the left hemisphere. And similarly at the back, the left hemisphere is larger than the

08:24.160 --> 08:28.720
right. When I was in medical school, that was always said to be because of language, but we

08:28.720 --> 08:34.400
know it is nothing to do with language. It has become used by language now that the brain has

08:34.400 --> 08:40.320
its expansion, that the expansion was not caused by language, because it's there in chimpanzees,

08:40.320 --> 08:45.520
gorillas, orangutans, and other creatures that we've tried to teach language to and got nowhere.

08:47.360 --> 08:54.720
And the third thing is the corpus callosum itself, this band of fibres, which only 2% of brain

08:54.720 --> 09:01.840
fibres actually cross from one hemisphere to the other. It's rather wonderful, this suburban doorbell

09:01.840 --> 09:11.440
suddenly coming in from the cosmic reaches. What I've got here is a normal human brain over, whoops,

09:11.440 --> 09:20.480
there. And over here, I was very privileged, I got a slice through Donald Trump's brain,

09:20.480 --> 09:27.520
and, oh no, sorry, it's a dog's brain. But anyway, what you see is that the dog's brain

09:27.520 --> 09:35.440
is smaller than a human brain, quite a lot, but the corpus callosum, which is, if I can do this,

09:36.080 --> 09:42.800
this, oh, band of fibres here, and the same thing in white over here, in the, whoops, in the,

09:44.240 --> 09:50.720
there. The dog didn't have a drink. And so you can see that it's not as big

09:51.600 --> 09:57.440
comparatively with the brain. So the corpus callosum is getting smaller over evolution,

09:57.440 --> 10:02.160
and it only started in mammals, prior to mammals that wasn't a corpus callosum at all.

10:03.280 --> 10:08.240
And get this, the main purpose of the corpus callosum is to inhibit, to tell one hemisphere

10:08.800 --> 10:15.040
to the other one, keep out of it. Many of the fibres that cross the corpus callosum, for those

10:15.040 --> 10:20.320
of you who are neuroscientists are excitedly, they're glutamatergic, but they abut on GABA

10:20.960 --> 10:31.360
ergic neurons, which are functionally inhibitory. And that, why this might have a reference to

10:31.360 --> 10:36.800
human culture is expanded in this book, The Master and His Emissive. Why would this have

10:36.800 --> 10:41.520
anything to do with human culture? Well, I'm going to explain to you that the two hemispheres have

10:41.520 --> 10:46.480
evolved to do completely different things. And in this book, I go into that and the philosophy of

10:46.480 --> 10:52.000
it. But I also look at the history of human culture and suggest that there are times when we

10:52.000 --> 10:59.520
have got these two aspects of our brains out of balance. I'll come on to that. Now, as was

10:59.520 --> 11:05.280
mentioned by Amir, a central concept for me is attention. When I discovered that one of the

11:05.280 --> 11:10.000
most important distinctions between the two brain hemispheres was the way in which they pay attention

11:10.000 --> 11:16.560
to the world. It didn't immediately dawn on me why this was so significant, because I had been

11:16.560 --> 11:21.840
trained in a mechanistic way of thinking about the brain, which was that attention is just another

11:21.840 --> 11:26.400
cognitive function that can be measured in the lab, and it could be simulated by a machine.

11:26.400 --> 11:33.200
A machine can be directed towards something, but it can't pay attention to it. And attention

11:33.200 --> 11:38.640
is something very special indeed, because I believe it actually creates the world,

11:38.640 --> 11:45.360
the only world that any of us can know is the world that comes into being for us. And that world

11:46.160 --> 11:53.680
is a combination of something coming from us and something out there. And I believe that this is

11:53.680 --> 11:59.680
a two way relationship. In fact, that all things in the cosmos have two way relationships are

11:59.680 --> 12:05.600
reverberative in their nature. And I'm trying to get away from naive realism on the one hand,

12:05.600 --> 12:12.400
and the naive idealism on the other. Naive realism, I call rot, that the reality is out

12:12.400 --> 12:18.000
there, R-O-T. And that's just nonsense, that there's just a world out there and we record it

12:18.000 --> 12:24.320
passively like a photographic plate or a sound recorder. No, something of us goes into what we

12:24.320 --> 12:29.920
find there, which is why what we find there has some very general common ground, but it is not

12:29.920 --> 12:35.040
identical in every experience, even by the same person, never mind by different persons.

12:35.680 --> 12:43.760
But I also don't think that it is what you might call mumbo made up miraculously by ourselves,

12:43.760 --> 12:49.680
M-U-M-B-O, which is the kind of postmodern idea that it's just a fantasy out of our brains.

12:49.680 --> 12:55.200
It is something that happens between, in what I call a betweenness. And a betweenness is not

12:55.200 --> 13:01.440
just a gap between. It is like an electric current. Where is the electric current? Is it in the

13:01.440 --> 13:06.640
positive terminal? No. Is it in the negative terminal? No. It needs them. Is it in the space

13:06.640 --> 13:12.480
between? No. It's in the whole ensemble. And betweenness is what happens when two things come

13:12.480 --> 13:20.480
into a new unit and something comes about that is different from either of any of its component

13:20.480 --> 13:26.880
parts, but subsumes them. So they're necessary but not sufficient. Now this is the mountain behind

13:26.880 --> 13:33.520
my house. Its name derives from a Norse word, which means a sloping rock. And you can see why,

13:33.520 --> 13:41.680
because from the sea, this mountain was a signal to the Vikings who came there a thousand years ago

13:41.680 --> 13:48.000
that this was a very dangerous bay in which they would be shipwrecked. So to them, this mountain

13:48.080 --> 13:53.360
was a landmark that meant life and death. But there were people here before the Vikings. There

13:53.360 --> 13:58.480
were the Picts and they've left their broths, their stone houses. And we know that for them,

13:59.200 --> 14:04.880
this mountain was the home of the gods. Then in the 18th century, people came to draw and paint in

14:04.880 --> 14:09.760
Scotland. It's a very beautiful landscape. And they would have seen this as a many-coloured,

14:09.760 --> 14:15.920
many-textured form of beauty. And then in the 19th century, people came and they were interested

14:16.000 --> 14:21.120
in geology. And it just happens to be an extremely good example of columnar basalt formation.

14:22.560 --> 14:26.720
So to all these people, it was something different. And then to a physicist, you ask a physicist what

14:26.720 --> 14:36.080
it does. But 99.99% of it is empty space. And the other bit, 0.01%, we don't really know what it is

14:36.080 --> 14:42.880
after all. So which of these is the real mountain, I ask you. Now my answer to that is that no one

14:42.880 --> 14:47.280
of them is the full story. But each of them is the real mountain. Each of them is a real way of

14:47.280 --> 14:51.440
looking at the mountain. And if you say to me, yeah, but come on, it's just a big lump of rock.

14:51.440 --> 14:57.440
That already is a very specialist way of looking at it, which betrays your values and your particular

14:57.440 --> 15:03.360
narrowness of way of viewing. Because it's many, many things. If you apply that across the world,

15:03.360 --> 15:09.520
you realise that attention is a creative act. Attention is a moral act. Because what you make

15:09.600 --> 15:15.040
of the world is something that really comes out. When I attend to you in a certain way,

15:15.040 --> 15:23.120
I can bring something that is warm, good, beneficent, perhaps healing as a good therapist or

15:23.120 --> 15:28.640
doctor might be able to do. If I pay attention to you in a clinically detached way, I can make

15:28.640 --> 15:34.880
you feel very small, very alien, and so on. We create the world around us. We actually make

15:34.880 --> 15:42.560
things through our attention. So how you attend matters, because it forms up like this. Once you

15:42.560 --> 15:47.680
start looking in one way, you find only the bits of the world that respond to the way you look.

15:47.680 --> 15:52.640
The world is a machine. So you look at it. This is mechanical. That's mechanical. The other is

15:52.640 --> 15:57.520
mechanical. The whole thing is a machine. But that's because looking at it as a machine,

15:57.520 --> 16:03.760
all you see are the bits that respond to that mechanistic view. And if you do, you then start

16:04.400 --> 16:09.040
to look further in this same way, thinking that was a good start. And now you just harden up. So

16:09.040 --> 16:14.560
after a few decades, it's very difficult to break out of a habit of mind that we are instilling

16:14.560 --> 16:20.880
into people in the West, which was never held at any other time in human history, never held in

16:20.880 --> 16:25.680
other parts of the world and the West until very recently, and is extremely odd.

16:26.640 --> 16:32.240
This is the kind of attention paid by the left hemisphere targeted on something. The reason that

16:32.240 --> 16:36.960
we have these two hemispheres, you measure why do we have these two hemispheres, is because the

16:36.960 --> 16:45.040
left is good at one thing only. It's much better than the right at grabbing, at grasping. And even

16:45.040 --> 16:53.520
the processes whereby we say we have grasped something, we have big glyphin, or indigene,

16:54.320 --> 17:05.760
or indeed, comprendre, is to grasp hold of, or apprehend, is to grasp onto. Comprehend is probably

17:05.760 --> 17:10.160
different. It's sort of see the whole together, which is what the right hemisphere alone can do.

17:10.160 --> 17:17.920
But this is how the left hemisphere looks at the world. A leads to be job done. But the broad view

17:17.920 --> 17:22.560
of the right hemisphere sees that A and B are connected, but not as directly as you thought,

17:22.560 --> 17:29.360
and that the system is living, hence the birds and the tree, and complex, not just complicated.

17:31.840 --> 17:36.160
You may say it's very facile to talk about one hemisphere as a whole. And of course,

17:37.040 --> 17:41.600
I am neurologically trained. I'm psychologically trained. I know that there are different areas

17:41.600 --> 17:45.520
in the brain. I know they have different functions. If you read my writing, you will find that the

17:45.520 --> 17:51.600
different areas do. But it is also now known that instead of thinking in a modular way about the

17:51.600 --> 17:58.880
brain, we should be thinking more in terms of whole networks. And indeed, when you excite one part of

17:59.920 --> 18:06.080
the left or the right hemisphere, there will be excitations that spread much more widely

18:06.080 --> 18:10.480
throughout that hemisphere. And this is to show you a couple of, sort of, if you like,

18:11.120 --> 18:16.720
superhighways of transmission, the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the insonant fasciculus,

18:16.720 --> 18:21.280
showing connections between the posterior part of the brain and the frontal lobes and between

18:21.280 --> 18:28.000
the frontal lobes and the temporal lobe. So this pains me. I'm going to do something

18:28.000 --> 18:34.880
it's extremely simple-minded and much more black and white than I would like it to be. But because

18:34.880 --> 18:40.400
I just don't have time, you'll have to take it as a bit of a caricature, but broadly speaking,

18:41.440 --> 18:46.080
it is what you can accept. And if you want to know the finesse and all the details,

18:46.080 --> 18:57.040
then read my books. So there are various differences. And one is that the left, I put the left hemisphere

18:57.040 --> 19:02.960
version on the left and the right hemisphere version on the right. And in these dichotomies,

19:02.960 --> 19:08.640
there are somewhat false dichotomies because nothing can be cut and dried when it comes to

19:08.640 --> 19:14.080
anything as complicated as the brain. But nonetheless, there are strong tendencies

19:14.080 --> 19:21.760
for the right hemisphere to be able to apprehend new experiences of whatever kind, new music,

19:21.760 --> 19:28.240
new person, new shape, whatever it might be. Whereas the left hemisphere latches on to what

19:28.240 --> 19:34.080
is already known and familiar because it's looking for food. It's looking for things to pick up

19:34.080 --> 19:41.520
with its right hand. And the evolutionary point here is that if you're only attending to food

19:42.160 --> 19:47.840
and a twig to build a nest and all the utilization of the world, the manipulation of the world,

19:47.840 --> 19:53.040
which the left hemisphere is good for, you'll soon be eaten by another creature while you're

19:53.040 --> 19:57.680
getting your own lunch, because you need to be looking out for predators, for your mate,

19:57.680 --> 20:04.880
for your constasifics. And so you have to have some part of your brain that is holding the whole

20:04.880 --> 20:10.160
picture together while you go about grabbing and picking what you know. It prefers what is certain

20:10.160 --> 20:15.280
to what is possible. In other words, it likes things to be cut and dried, black and white.

20:15.280 --> 20:25.760
Whereas the right hemisphere is more open to ambiguity. The left hemisphere prefers fixity.

20:26.960 --> 20:32.640
It likes to fix things. And literally, when people have a certain kind of damage to the right

20:33.600 --> 20:40.400
posterior hemisphere, they begin to see normal flow of motion broken up into

20:42.160 --> 20:50.400
like a sort of an old fashioned cine film that's got stuck or stop go animation.

20:51.760 --> 20:56.080
Because after all, it's targeting something and wants to catch it. So it fixes it and picks it up.

20:56.080 --> 21:00.720
So it sees a lot of static bits, whereas the right hemisphere sees that everything is flowing.

21:01.680 --> 21:05.920
The left hemisphere sees parts where the right hemisphere sees the whole.

21:06.960 --> 21:11.120
The right hemisphere has the body image in it, which is the whole image of the body and all

21:11.120 --> 21:19.680
modalities. The left hemisphere has a nose, an elbow, a knee, a foot. Explicit versus implicit.

21:19.680 --> 21:24.960
So the left hemisphere understands what is explicit, what if you have a dictionary and a grammar,

21:24.960 --> 21:30.560
and perhaps a computer could put them together. But all that is implicit, which is nine tenths

21:30.560 --> 21:38.160
of what matters to us, things like love and a sense of the sacred and the meaning of music

21:38.160 --> 21:45.040
and the understanding of poetry, the understanding of humor, sarcasm, irony, all these things that

21:45.040 --> 21:52.000
change the way the world is to be interpreted are taken at face value by the left hemisphere,

21:52.000 --> 21:57.680
though understood by the right. The left hemisphere tends to abstract things from their context.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.120
And if you take things out of their context, they change their meaning completely.

22:01.840 --> 22:06.560
And the best way to understand something is to see it in the context, which makes it what it is.

22:06.560 --> 22:12.400
Nothing is something outside of its context. The context is what actually creates it,

22:13.040 --> 22:19.200
which is one of the reasons I say that relations are prior to things. The title of my later book

22:19.200 --> 22:24.800
is the matter with things, which is a pun about our obsession with matter and our obsession with

22:24.800 --> 22:32.400
things. But things, I say, arise secondarily out of a web of relationships. They are the things

22:32.400 --> 22:38.640
that catch our attention. They are the little hubs where things cross, but actually they are

22:38.640 --> 22:45.600
only what they are because of their relations. In abstracting, it turns whatever it has into a

22:45.600 --> 22:50.160
general case, not a unique one. And here, because I'm in Switzerland, this first time I've ever

22:50.160 --> 22:56.880
talked about this with two wonderfully described cases, rather sad cases. One is of a woman who

22:56.880 --> 23:04.080
spent her whole life describing and writing about the birds of Switzerland. And you have a wonderful

23:04.720 --> 23:12.880
bird life here in Switzerland. And she had a right posterior temporal parietal stroke.

23:13.360 --> 23:21.680
And afterwards, she said, all the birds look the same. This is pretty tragic. And another is a

23:21.680 --> 23:28.160
case of a farmer, Swiss farmer, who knew all his cattle by name. But after a stroke, he had difficulty

23:28.160 --> 23:34.880
telling a cow from a horse. So you see, it deals in very broad categories, but the right hemisphere

23:34.880 --> 23:40.240
sees the unique case, sees the ewness of you, and the vesseness of your friend.

23:42.720 --> 23:47.360
The left hemisphere is mainly interested in how much of something the right hemisphere mourn,

23:47.360 --> 23:55.200
but how, what is the quality of it? Naturally, this world becomes inanimate. And the right

23:55.200 --> 24:00.400
hemisphere sees the animosity. And you can actually isolate one hemisphere at a time,

24:00.400 --> 24:06.880
painlessly, experimentally, using something called transcranial magnetic stimulation. And if you

24:07.920 --> 24:15.360
suppress the right hemisphere, people see what they would normally think of as living as inanimate.

24:15.360 --> 24:20.800
If you suppress the left hemisphere, they see things that we would normally think of as inanimate,

24:20.800 --> 24:28.000
like the sun, as a living being. The left hemisphere is remarkably optimistic,

24:28.080 --> 24:34.000
ridiculously optimistic. Again, you can isolate one hemisphere at a time. And this is done sometimes

24:34.000 --> 24:42.480
prior to brain surgery. And it's called the WADA test. And while one hemisphere is isolated,

24:42.480 --> 24:46.320
the other one is not contributing. It lasts for about 15 minutes. During that time,

24:47.280 --> 24:52.480
some psychologists administered a personality inventory to the subject and also to the subject's

24:52.480 --> 24:58.080
relatives and friends and discovered that the left hemisphere has a very high opinion of itself

24:58.080 --> 25:02.960
compared with what other people think. But when it was the right hemisphere's turn, the right hemisphere

25:02.960 --> 25:07.920
was a little bit too negative about itself, but more realistic. And the most extraordinary

25:09.040 --> 25:14.560
demonstration of this is denial. This is terribly important because I believe we now live in an age

25:14.560 --> 25:21.600
of denial. All around us, we are denying a whole host of things, trying to not see them at all or

25:21.680 --> 25:28.960
saying the opposite is the case. And this is very literal. After the left hemisphere stroke,

25:28.960 --> 25:34.160
somebody may have a paralyzed right arm or right leg, and they'll be very unhappy about this. They

25:34.160 --> 25:40.080
will weep about it, complain to the doctor. But if they've had a stroke in the right hemisphere and

25:40.080 --> 25:45.520
the left side is paralyzed, they may completely deny there's anything wrong. So you can see them in

25:45.520 --> 25:49.120
the morning after they come into the stroke in the night and say, how are you? And they say,

25:49.920 --> 25:54.880
fine. They say, oh, that's very good. And any difficulty moving anything? No, no. Can you move

25:54.880 --> 25:59.600
your left arm? Yep. Can you show me? And they go there, but nothing actually moved. And if you

25:59.600 --> 26:04.320
bring it round in front of them and say, move that, they say, that's not my arm. That belongs to that

26:04.320 --> 26:11.040
person over there, or it belongs to you, doctor. And the most important, but least exciting,

26:11.040 --> 26:16.880
perhaps, of this list is the difference between something that is truly present and something

26:16.960 --> 26:22.480
that is represented. Now, represented literally means presented again, after which is no longer

26:22.480 --> 26:30.400
present, is therefore already past finished dead. And presenting is something that we don't allow

26:30.400 --> 26:35.280
the world to do nowadays, because we're so quick with our representations. Oh, it's one of those.

26:35.280 --> 26:40.640
It's a picturesque scene. It's a lake. It's a car. It's a water. We don't, only if we practice

26:40.640 --> 26:50.800
mindfulness, are we able to get back to that state in which we are fully present and the world

26:50.800 --> 26:59.600
is fully present to us? Okay, that's because I didn't know how to build that slide. Hello.

26:59.600 --> 27:06.080
Yes, we've heard from you before. Now, so effectively, what you've got here, I'd like

27:06.080 --> 27:11.200
to draw this together. So you see the kind of world that the left hemisphere brings into being

27:11.200 --> 27:18.000
for us. It's effectively, I think we may have more problems with my poor skills at building slides,

27:18.000 --> 27:24.320
but let's see. Ooh, that's all right. So first of all, you've got a world in what we take for reality.

27:24.320 --> 27:36.560
Better?

27:45.280 --> 27:46.880
Yeah, yeah. Has it stopped working?

27:47.120 --> 27:54.960
Well, it's been very quiet all along. I'd have liked it to be louder, but I'm not a technician.

27:59.280 --> 28:02.320
No, I'm fine. Oh, that's better. That's a bit too much.

28:02.320 --> 28:16.800
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So first of all, what we take to be reality is in fact,

28:16.800 --> 28:24.160
just a representation, a map, a picture, a diagram, but not the complex living home.

28:25.120 --> 28:32.880
One that is, in fact, made up of isolated things, things moreover than known, familiar,

28:32.880 --> 28:40.800
decontextualized, fixed, predetermined, and made up of bits, fragments, disembodied,

28:40.800 --> 28:48.000
having no meaning or coherence until we give it to them, where all is abstract,

28:48.960 --> 28:55.680
generic in nature, infinitely reproducible and quantifiable, and therefore inanimate

28:57.360 --> 29:03.680
and mechanical. And the future is a fantasy which would be only better if we could get

29:03.680 --> 29:14.400
more of it under our control. Whereas, in the right hemisphere, one sees that nothing is ever

29:14.480 --> 29:20.720
entirely certain or predictable, that all things are ultimately interconnected,

29:21.520 --> 29:27.600
that there is nothing that is ever fixed, but in fact that, as Heraclitus said, everything flows,

29:29.280 --> 29:34.800
that what exists are holds, the parts are an artifact of the left hemisphere's way of looking at

29:34.800 --> 29:43.520
it, that meaning is implicit, and that the world of uniqueness is real, not just categories that

29:43.520 --> 29:48.880
can be quantified, but having different qualities, and an essentially animate world.

29:49.760 --> 29:55.200
And here there's a future that is a product of realism, not denial. We've got one

29:55.840 --> 30:01.840
hemisphere that sees just a theory of the world, it's very simple and pleasing and is only going

30:01.840 --> 30:10.080
to get better. The right hemisphere is seeing the whole embodied, impassioned business of vitality

30:10.080 --> 30:14.000
and seeing that it is not necessarily leading somewhere we want to go.

30:15.680 --> 30:20.160
And there is a relationship between the brain and the structure of the cosmos.

30:22.160 --> 30:26.640
That's something I'm going to try and explain now. There is a sort of hierarchy of the right

30:26.640 --> 30:31.200
and left, let me say this first of all. I think I've explained that the right hemisphere is more

30:31.280 --> 30:39.920
veridical, that it is a better transmitter of producer of reality, and the left hemisphere

30:39.920 --> 30:46.640
has certain limited uses. What it sees is not wrong, it's not that it's got no use,

30:46.640 --> 30:52.320
it's just that its use is very limited and its knowledge is limited. The problem only becomes

30:52.320 --> 30:57.600
when it thinks it knows more and we pay attention to that very narrow way of thinking as though it

30:57.600 --> 31:02.320
gives us the full picture, which it doesn't. So there's a hierarchy there and I think this is

31:02.320 --> 31:08.560
also demonstrable in physics, I've explained that. And I would say that when we're talking about

31:08.560 --> 31:13.760
how we would like to make a world, it's a fantasy for us to imagine that we can just make up a world

31:13.760 --> 31:20.160
without understanding both our own brains and the cosmos. And so this is where we need to start from

31:20.160 --> 31:22.560
in all our exercises of imagination.

31:26.960 --> 31:33.600
In whatever exists, there is a replication of this thing about the brain, which is that the

31:33.600 --> 31:39.360
left hemisphere tends to divide in order to understand, but then cannot put it together again.

31:39.360 --> 31:46.320
But the right hemisphere tends to see the whole and see the whole picture of which what the left

31:46.320 --> 31:51.360
hemisphere has been looking at is just a part. Now, we need both these kinds of attention,

31:51.360 --> 31:55.840
but one of them is more important than the other, the capacity to see the whole.

31:56.560 --> 32:03.520
And there are these forces for division and forces for union throughout the physical cosmos as well

32:03.520 --> 32:10.560
as the metaphysical one. And what we need is the unity of the forces of division and union,

32:10.560 --> 32:17.840
not the division of the forces of division and union. Do you understand? I sometimes say we

32:17.840 --> 32:29.280
don't want either, either or or both and we need both either or and both and. I hope that's entirely

32:29.280 --> 32:39.600
clear. So this idea of the unity of difference and unity is the first asymmetry. The cosmos is founded

32:39.600 --> 32:48.560
on asymmetry. So this is all played out in this recent book of mine in two volumes,

32:49.440 --> 32:58.400
1300 pages of text, 1500 all together. Now it's based on this idea that science and philosophy

32:58.400 --> 33:03.920
should never have been divorced. The word science in English only began being used to

33:03.920 --> 33:10.720
specialize meaning in 1830. Until then science meant knowledge. And indeed what we call science

33:10.720 --> 33:17.600
is called natural philosophy because in fact, what scientists don't see anymore is there is no such

33:17.600 --> 33:24.240
thing as just looking because the way you attend the preconceptions of which you attend alters

33:24.240 --> 33:29.680
what you find. If you don't know anything about philosophy, you just think it's obvious that

33:29.680 --> 33:35.840
everything is mechanical because that is the philosophy of our age. That is what people suck up

33:35.840 --> 33:42.480
from all around them as they grow, that everything is mechanical, but it is not actually mechanical.

33:42.480 --> 33:48.960
Organisms in particular are not like machines in at least eight ways which I explain in this book.

33:48.960 --> 33:53.520
And here I'm quoting from my favorite English philosopher of the last 100 years, the antagonism

33:53.520 --> 33:59.360
between science and metaphysics is like all family quarrels being disastrous and from calling

33:59.360 --> 34:04.480
words science and metaphysics are inextricably united and stand all four together. Any of you

34:04.480 --> 34:12.400
who hear a scientist, please take that away and think about it. It does matter. And one of the

34:12.400 --> 34:19.680
things that I wanted to talk about was the centrality of attention to what comes into existence. I've

34:19.680 --> 34:26.560
talked a bit about that already. Then the coincidence of opposites. Now to our way of thinking now,

34:26.560 --> 34:32.480
how can opposites coincide? It sounds impossible. We're taught at school that if it's this then

34:32.480 --> 34:37.840
the opposite is as far away from it as possible. But this is not the case actually because mental

34:37.840 --> 34:43.840
space, metaphysical space and indeed physical space is curved. It's not linear. And the further

34:43.840 --> 34:48.320
you go in a certain direction, the more you find yourself coming back to what you are running away

34:48.320 --> 34:57.840
from. It's a truism that anarchy leads to tyranny, that something extreme gives rise to its opposite

34:57.840 --> 35:03.120
because it has its opposite in it. I've always thought that politicians is extreme left and

35:03.120 --> 35:07.440
extreme right. You can hardly get a razor blade between them. They've got the same mentality

35:07.440 --> 35:14.000
which is to miss all the shades, the complexities, the subtleties of human existence.

35:14.960 --> 35:21.600
And I've already mentioned that I believe that relations come before a lot of the things that

35:21.600 --> 35:26.800
are related. And then I just want to say something about limit cases being inverted. This is my view

35:26.800 --> 35:35.360
of reality that in the old world, in the old world of physics, we thought that this was a

35:35.360 --> 35:41.040
Newtonian world, that things are naturally static and they don't move unless they're given a push.

35:41.120 --> 35:45.440
But now we know that there is nothing that is actually static in the entire cosmos. Everything

35:45.440 --> 35:52.400
is in motion and stasis would be the limit case of motion, not motion, the limit case of stasis.

35:53.360 --> 36:01.120
Representation is the limit case of what is actually real. Total independence is the limit

36:01.120 --> 36:07.120
case of interdependence because everything is interdependent. There is no such thing as total

36:07.120 --> 36:12.880
independence but if it exists at all, it will be the limit case of the norm which is interdependence.

36:13.680 --> 36:21.280
Discontinuity is not the norm which then gets connected. Continuity is the norm. You may say

36:21.280 --> 36:27.440
why do you say that? I can quote physicists who say this. Metaphysically, I believe it to be the

36:27.440 --> 36:35.200
case. From observation of the world, I believe it to be the case. But discontinuity is the limit

36:35.200 --> 36:42.720
case of the continuous. The explicit is not the norm and the implicit, some very strange thing that

36:42.720 --> 36:50.800
happens in a poem. Implicit is what all our knowledge is. Explicit knowledge is a very special case

36:50.800 --> 37:00.480
that we learn how to say in words through the process of education. The literal is the limit

37:00.480 --> 37:06.960
case of the metaphorical. Everything is metaphorical. Even the words, in fact, particularly the words

37:06.960 --> 37:11.040
used by science and philosophy, a point that has been made by philosophers themselves,

37:11.680 --> 37:17.120
are based on metaphors because they're dealing in an abstract realm and they therefore have to draw

37:17.120 --> 37:22.320
things from a real world. In fact, the word abstract is itself, something that means being

37:22.320 --> 37:28.960
dragged away. I mean, it's very physical. So meaning is effectively metaphorical and the

37:28.960 --> 37:33.680
literal is only a special case of the metaphorical in which you privilege one kind of meaning.

37:34.480 --> 37:39.200
Randomness, which actually doesn't exist anywhere in the cosmos, would merely, if it existed,

37:39.200 --> 37:46.640
be the limit case of order, which is everywhere. Simplicity represents a special case of complexity

37:46.640 --> 37:55.360
because the more you go down, even into the quantum vacuum, this is the simplest thing that we know.

37:55.440 --> 38:00.480
According to David Tong, Professor of Physics at Cambridge, it's unbelievably complex.

38:01.760 --> 38:07.680
Simplicity is what we make when we clear away all the complexity. Ah, I've got a mechanism.

38:07.680 --> 38:14.960
How lovely. That gives me a little tweak power. The determinant is the limit of the indeterminate.

38:14.960 --> 38:21.280
Everything is actually ultimately indeterminate, but in very special cases, if you take the window

38:21.280 --> 38:26.960
narrow enough, you can say it looks determinate. And straight lines are the limit case of curves,

38:26.960 --> 38:32.320
not curves, some special case of straight lines. So all that exists is a kind of form.

38:32.320 --> 38:36.720
And in the words of Whitehead, beyond all questions of quantity, there lie questions

38:36.720 --> 38:42.320
of pattern, which are essential to the understanding of nature. And form is a matter of tension.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.760
Can I go back? Yes. This is from my favorite

38:48.720 --> 38:52.960
presocratic philosopher, Heraclitus, or my favorite philosopher, frankly,

38:52.960 --> 38:58.240
they do not understand how a thing agrees with variance at variance with itself.

38:59.440 --> 39:04.880
It is an attunement turning back on itself like that of the bow and lair. What did he mean?

39:04.880 --> 39:10.640
He meant that things are always in balance of their opposites, that wherever something exists,

39:10.640 --> 39:18.240
its dark side, the other end of it is there as well. And that what you look for is not to collapse

39:18.240 --> 39:24.640
this creative tension into just this or just that, but to hold the tension. For us, this is

39:24.640 --> 39:28.880
uncomfortable. Therefore, we try to collapse it. Oh, it's just that or it's just that. No,

39:28.880 --> 39:36.080
you have to hold the two opposites. And the bow and the lair is the string of the bow,

39:36.080 --> 39:42.560
the string of the lair gives rise to the note that gives rise to the flying arrow. And if you

39:42.560 --> 39:47.840
let that tension go slack and didn't pull into opposite directions, pulling in opposite directions

39:47.840 --> 39:52.320
is logically a waste of time. But actually, it's essential to everything that exists,

39:52.320 --> 39:57.360
because this tension is creative. You want to make a good apple pie, you don't get boring,

39:57.360 --> 40:01.120
bland apples, you get nice tart apples and put lots of honey with it.

40:02.080 --> 40:09.680
And this is one of his deepest sayings, grasping, which means the coming together of things,

40:09.680 --> 40:16.320
hose and not holes, convergent, divergent, constant dissonant from all things one,

40:16.320 --> 40:20.400
and from one thing all. I would love to have time to unpack that for you, but

40:21.680 --> 40:27.920
take it away and read it and think about it. And that relates to the idea of one and all.

40:27.920 --> 40:32.320
I have a chapter on the coincidental or positive or on the coincidence opposites,

40:32.320 --> 40:38.080
and a chapter on the one and the many. And I say it is wise, or he says it is wise,

40:38.080 --> 40:44.160
listening not to me, but to the logos, which is like the founding ground of being,

40:44.160 --> 40:49.840
to agree that all things are one. And I foot in brackets and that the one is all things,

40:49.840 --> 40:55.040
because the Greek grammar allows this ambiguity of dual interpretation.

40:56.000 --> 41:02.240
As I say, he also, and this is the second important point about physics, is that everything flows.

41:02.240 --> 41:06.640
That's not the same as everything changes. There is a Buddhist saying that everything changes.

41:06.640 --> 41:12.320
It's good as far as it goes, but everything flows is better, because not only does it suggest

41:12.320 --> 41:16.560
there's a difference between the meaning of flow and just the succession of things,

41:17.120 --> 41:22.640
but also it contains within it the important idea that when things flow,

41:22.640 --> 41:29.680
they both are different and the same. The river that flows by my house is always the same river,

41:29.680 --> 41:34.800
but the water is always different. And Heraclitus said famously, you can't step into the same water

41:34.800 --> 41:42.240
twice. But that is beautiful, because he also said by changing things remain the same.

41:42.240 --> 41:46.320
See, this very interesting idea that comes from observing the flow,

41:46.320 --> 41:50.080
that in the flowing it remains what it is, but it also becomes something other.

41:50.960 --> 41:56.880
Then here is Democritus, another early Greek philosopher. The cause of coming into being of

41:56.880 --> 42:02.080
all things is the vortex. The vortex, of course, is a whirlpool. And this is terribly important,

42:02.720 --> 42:10.000
because, well, this is about flow really. This is David Tong again from Cambridge.

42:10.000 --> 42:15.360
At a fundamental level, nature is nature discreet or continuous. I see no evidence,

42:15.360 --> 42:20.400
whatever for discreteness. All the discreteness we see in the world is something which emerges

42:20.400 --> 42:26.080
from an underlying continuum. Contra are emergent, they're not built into the heart of nature.

42:26.080 --> 42:30.080
So there we need discontinuity and we need continuity, but continuity

42:30.960 --> 42:35.680
trumps, if you like, discontinuity. It is able to overarch the two.

42:37.760 --> 42:42.880
And here is the vortex. And there's various interesting things about the vortex. First

42:42.880 --> 42:48.880
of all, if you look at a whirlpool in a stream, a whirlpool is photographed or measurable. It can

42:48.880 --> 42:56.720
move stones. Is it in the water? No, it's not in the water like the stone is in the water. It is

42:56.720 --> 43:04.000
water. For that moment, it is that water. And I believe that beings, including every one of you

43:04.000 --> 43:10.160
here, if you think about your nature and your being, you are like this whirlpool in that you are not

43:10.160 --> 43:16.480
distinct from whatever it is that constitutes as a sort of indigestible lump. You are from

43:16.480 --> 43:21.760
something that is already there, that takes the form you take at the moment. And when you go,

43:21.760 --> 43:27.200
it will be passed on and will still be part of the flow of the river. So there are various things

43:27.200 --> 43:35.600
about vortex. One is that it has the nature of a spiral, as you see. And spiral staircases are

43:35.600 --> 43:42.640
very important because they are a good image of how we progress in life. TS Eliot said that the end

43:42.640 --> 43:47.680
of all our voyaging is to return to the point where we started from and know it for the first time.

43:48.480 --> 43:53.920
But that's not actually true. We don't ever return. We can't ever return to the point we started from

43:53.920 --> 43:59.200
because it's gone. We come back somewhere higher on the spiral and look down at where we had been

43:59.280 --> 44:04.320
before. But nonetheless, the progress is in one sense circular, but it's also up.

44:07.680 --> 44:13.040
And this is Jacob's Ladder, as depicted by the poet and painter William Blake,

44:13.040 --> 44:18.240
romantic poet and painter. And it's the only Jacob's Ladder I know, which shows it not as a

44:18.240 --> 44:23.440
straight line to heaven, but as a spiral that climbs in this way forever.

44:24.080 --> 44:35.680
And this is really just to say, if you look at a spiral down its axis, you see a perfect circle,

44:35.680 --> 44:41.280
which is static and eternal. But if you look along the side of the spiral, you see that it's

44:41.280 --> 44:47.520
actually not a particle, but a waveform, and that it is extending somewhere in space. It has

44:47.520 --> 44:55.920
circularity, recurrence and newness in one. This is just to show that in flow, there is always

44:55.920 --> 45:01.040
movement, which is reciprocal. That's one of the things that flow gives rise to.

45:02.880 --> 45:09.920
And these are rather interesting. These are photographs taken of the flow in water.

45:09.920 --> 45:20.640
And what has been done is simply a straight line of rectangular rods that are rectangular in cross

45:20.640 --> 45:28.400
section immersed in the stream. So absolute rigidity, straight pieces, bars in a line.

45:28.400 --> 45:34.080
And what you get is this completely wonderful creative newness, which flows and changes.

45:34.320 --> 45:44.240
This is something called the Karman Vortex Street, which is created by an obstruction simply stuck

45:44.240 --> 45:50.400
into the flow of water. And it results in this amazingly beautiful form. This is suggesting that

45:50.400 --> 45:56.480
flow and the obstruction of flow are creative. In my philosophy, resistance to flow is as

45:56.480 --> 46:02.240
important as flow. Resistance is creative. Without resistance, nothing can happen. What is friction?

46:02.880 --> 46:08.640
It's what stops movement, but it's also what starts movement. Without friction, I can't take a step.

46:09.200 --> 46:15.040
So these things come together in this way. And this is from Leonardo. He's showing an old man

46:15.040 --> 46:21.120
leaning on a stick in the water. And there he shows the patterns that follow, which he describes as

46:21.120 --> 46:30.320
like braided hair coming from the stick. And the most beautiful ratio on which many aesthetic

46:32.800 --> 46:38.640
figures and pictures and so on are based is the so-called golden section, which is asymmetric.

46:39.440 --> 46:45.760
It has this interesting asymmetry built into it. And this is just to say that each of those rectangles

46:45.760 --> 46:53.680
is in relation to the next rectangle in the ratio of 1 to 1.61, which is roughly speaking,

46:53.680 --> 47:01.200
that of the golden ratio. And it relates to a spiral. Here you can see the generation of the

47:01.200 --> 47:08.720
spiral out of it. This spiral is, again, part of the asymmetry of nature. And they're both going

47:09.680 --> 47:15.200
forward from something, but completing something at the same time. These are snowflakes. They are all

47:16.000 --> 47:25.600
the random, we say, expression of form. They are all beautifully, in one sense, themselves,

47:25.600 --> 47:31.840
but they are also fractal. So as you go down the stem, you see further expressions, which are of the

47:31.840 --> 47:40.400
overall nature of the whole snowflake. And this is fractality, which is another expression

47:40.400 --> 47:49.360
of difference in unity. So there is a unity. And as you go down into it, and things differentiate,

47:49.360 --> 47:56.080
they become more and more versions of the same thing in the way that beautiful things often have

47:56.080 --> 48:09.280
this asymmetry built into them. I mentioned the golden ratio. But here is an example,

48:09.280 --> 48:15.040
so many of them from Japanese art, where there is both symmetry and asymmetry. And get this,

48:15.040 --> 48:23.680
it's not just asymmetry that matters. It's the asymmetry of symmetry with asymmetry. Look at that.

48:23.680 --> 48:27.520
In a way, it is symmetrical, but in an important way, it's also asymmetrical.

48:28.240 --> 48:33.840
And it's the coming together of these two opposites that creates beauty. This is very profound in

48:33.840 --> 48:40.400
beauty. Here is Palladier's villa, the Villa Capra, now known as the Villa Rotonda,

48:42.320 --> 48:51.280
in the region of Vicenza Padua. And you see that in this, in some ways, very formally perfect,

48:51.360 --> 49:02.240
symmetrical facade. There are little signs of life. There are these figures that these figures

49:02.240 --> 49:08.880
that are living and asymmetrical. And here there is a goat, which was the coat of arms of the

49:08.880 --> 49:16.640
Capra family. And so it has a sense of the beautiful symmetry, but complemented by asymmetry.

49:16.640 --> 49:21.840
Now look at this, which is a copy of it basically, built at the University of Virginia by Thomas

49:21.840 --> 49:32.480
Jefferson, who is a not inconsiderable architect. It's just symmetrical. I had to put that in,

49:34.000 --> 49:39.040
because there's asymmetry and symmetry and the asymmetry of symmetry and asymmetry.

49:40.960 --> 49:45.440
So something about sameness and difference is very important. We don't just want

49:45.440 --> 49:52.480
difference or sameness, but both together. And this is from Goethe, from his father,

49:53.680 --> 50:00.400
dividing the united, uniting the divided is the very life of nature. This is the eternal

50:00.400 --> 50:07.760
cistern and diasterly, the eternal coalescence and separation, the inhalation and exhalation

50:07.760 --> 50:14.960
of the world in which we live and where our existence is woven. And cistern and diasterly

50:14.960 --> 50:22.240
are the two beats of the heart, cisterly is the lup and diasterly is the dup of relaxation.

50:24.400 --> 50:31.440
Now, just to finish on physics, I wanted to quote Pasteur, who of course was a biologist,

50:32.080 --> 50:37.120
the universe as a whole is asymmetrical. And I've come to believe that life, as it is

50:37.120 --> 50:46.960
manifest, is a function of the asymmetry of the universe. I would even say that living

50:46.960 --> 50:53.040
species are primordially in their structure, in their external forms, functions of the cosmic

50:53.040 --> 51:02.000
asymmetry from his inaugural lecture in 1854 at Lille. And here, some 40 years later,

51:02.720 --> 51:09.200
is Pierre Cooley, of course, a great physicist, certain elements of symmetry may coexist with

51:09.200 --> 51:14.800
certain phenomena, but they're not necessary. What is necessary is that certain elements of

51:14.800 --> 51:21.040
symmetry do not exist. It is asymmetry which creates the phenomenon, the effects produced maybe

51:21.040 --> 51:30.080
more symmetrical than the causes. And I just put this here, in 1956, this Chinese lady made this

51:30.080 --> 51:37.440
discovery of the violation of parity, which means the left and right hand are not symmetrical,

51:37.440 --> 51:41.200
in the case of the weak interaction, all the other forces that have been discovered were

51:41.200 --> 51:47.360
symmetrical, but then she discovered this is asymmetrical. And I'm sorry to report to you that

51:48.080 --> 51:52.480
about three or four years later, two men got the Nobel Prize for this discovery.

51:52.480 --> 51:59.920
There we are. Now, what has this got to do with the world we live in? I'm going to do this very

51:59.920 --> 52:08.000
quickly, you'll be glad to know. I believe that over the course of the history of the West,

52:08.000 --> 52:13.920
we've gone through phases. In the Greek civilization, there was a sudden efflorescence of everything,

52:13.920 --> 52:19.840
of the arts, of the sciences together. Then in the Roman world, there was something similar.

52:20.400 --> 52:26.000
And in each of those cases, it tailed off over 300 or 400 years and that civilization disappeared.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.920
And then again, in our age, the sudden eruption of wonderful working together of the right and

52:31.920 --> 52:36.320
left hemisphere, which are both necessary for science. In fact, the more important one is the

52:36.320 --> 52:41.120
right hemisphere. So don't ever quote Mia saying that left hemisphere is science and the right

52:41.120 --> 52:47.120
hemisphere is the arts. We need both for both. And in both cases, the right hemisphere asymmetrically

52:47.120 --> 52:55.280
is more important than the left, even in science. I believe that in our world, like those worlds,

52:55.280 --> 53:00.000
in which I've shown in the second part of the masternism, that things have drifted further

53:00.000 --> 53:05.200
and further to the left hemisphere point of view, it's happening to us now. Now, if I'm right, let's

53:05.200 --> 53:15.280
do a little fantasy. Let's imagine that actually, the left hemisphere was the only one we were

53:15.280 --> 53:21.040
listening to. What would the world look like? Well, there'll be a loss of the broader picture.

53:22.560 --> 53:28.880
Knowledge would be replaced by information's tokens or representations of true understanding.

53:28.880 --> 53:33.920
Wisdom wouldn't get anywhere near it because wisdom is much too unmeasurable. The product of a

53:33.920 --> 53:38.000
properly lived human life has nothing there that the left hemisphere can get hold of.

53:38.800 --> 53:44.400
Can't be operationalized. There'll be the loss of the concepts, therefore, of skill and judgment,

53:44.400 --> 53:51.520
which are essential to being a fully functioning human being. They'd all be taken over by machines

53:51.520 --> 53:56.800
that had algorithms and things like that. So we'd spend hours talking to machines and getting nowhere

53:56.800 --> 54:01.680
instead of talking to people who would exercise skill and judgment. I'd hate to live in that world.

54:02.320 --> 54:08.000
And there'll be simultaneous abstraction and reification. So one of the same time,

54:08.000 --> 54:12.640
things would become more and more abstract. The stuff you read would have more and more

54:12.640 --> 54:18.240
abstract nouns in it. It wouldn't refer to reality. At the same time, matter would become just lump

54:18.240 --> 54:23.520
and matter. I always say that materialists are not people who overvalue matter but undervalue

54:23.520 --> 54:27.760
matter because matter is very, very special. Even if you believe there is only matter, then you've

54:27.760 --> 54:32.640
got to accept that matter gave rise to Bach's and John's passions. So it's pretty amazing stuff.

54:34.000 --> 54:38.080
Bureaucracy would have a field day because, according to Peter Berger, a great sociologist,

54:38.080 --> 54:47.520
these are the characteristics of bureaucracy. I'll let you read them. And there'd be a loss

54:47.520 --> 54:53.200
of the sense of uniqueness, just categories. On those things, you had to fill out which box.

54:53.200 --> 54:58.320
There's never a box for me. But wait a minute, with whom, on which day, in what circumstances,

54:59.200 --> 55:06.480
and in what mood, quantity would become the only criteria, not quality. There'd be a sort of either

55:06.480 --> 55:11.200
ornus. No, you can't have, well, it might be this, it might be that. You've got to go, yes,

55:11.200 --> 55:18.400
it's this or yes, it's that. Reasonableness would be replaced by pure raciocination,

55:18.400 --> 55:22.640
which is not the same thing. In German, there's a distinction, as you know, the German speakers

55:22.640 --> 55:28.240
here between Vernunft and Frischland. And we don't have this distinction in English. So I make the

55:28.240 --> 55:33.600
distinction between reason, which is an embodied thing that comes with experience and being able

55:33.600 --> 55:40.240
to think clearly, whereas rationalization is just the application of logical rules.

55:40.240 --> 55:44.640
There'd be a failure of what we call common sense, and there's now extremely uncommon.

55:45.360 --> 55:50.480
There'd be systems designed simply to maximize utility, loss of social cohesion,

55:50.480 --> 55:56.000
depersonalization, paranoia and lack of trust, because the left hemisphere wants to control.

55:56.000 --> 56:01.120
Its only power is control. So if it thinks things are slipping out of control, it's starting,

56:01.120 --> 56:06.400
how can I control them better? We need more cameras. We need perhaps a database. Yes,

56:06.400 --> 56:11.680
let's have a database of the genomes of the population. There'd be a need, in other words,

56:11.680 --> 56:18.400
for total control and anger and aggression would be the term of our conversations.

56:18.400 --> 56:23.360
People think the bad old days used to say, oh, the left hemisphere is down to earth,

56:23.360 --> 56:29.440
reliable, but not emotional. Whereas the right hemisphere is a bit given to moods,

56:29.440 --> 56:34.640
you know, that's terrible. But actually, the emotion that most strongly lateralizes,

56:34.640 --> 56:39.520
of all emotions, is anger, and it lateralizes to the left hemisphere, not to the right.

56:42.080 --> 56:46.560
And we would, you remember how when something doesn't work, oh, it's nothing to do with me,

56:46.560 --> 56:51.760
I can't be responsible, remember that? Well, we would be the passive victims of other people's

56:51.760 --> 56:59.680
doings, never a problem with us. And in this world, art would become pretty conceptual. It would have

57:01.840 --> 57:07.200
Latin, a sense of depth and bizarre perspectives. These are things that only the right hemisphere

57:07.200 --> 57:12.240
can fully understand, and therefore came into being three times in Greece, in Rome. It wasn't

57:12.240 --> 57:19.760
just invented in Florence in 1453. It was invented serially, and then lost the civilization decayed,

57:19.760 --> 57:24.640
because it's how the right hemisphere sees depth in the world, not just the screen in front of it.

57:25.520 --> 57:29.600
Music would reduce a little more than rhythm, because that's the only bit the left hemisphere

57:29.600 --> 57:35.760
gets. The complexities of melody and harmony are interpreted by the right hemisphere, that is

57:35.760 --> 57:40.240
the distinction in professional musicians who train their brains especially, but that's the norm.

57:41.200 --> 57:46.720
And language would become, I hope not too much like mine, diffuse, excessive, lacking in concrete

57:46.720 --> 57:51.920
reference. There'd be a deliberate undercutting of the sense of awe or wonder, because what does

57:51.920 --> 57:56.320
that mean? It just means you haven't done enough research yet. Of course, we understand everything.

57:56.320 --> 58:01.360
One more experiment, and we really have got it, that actually to be fully present in the world and

58:01.360 --> 58:07.360
to understand it, and to be appreciative of it with gratitude, which is the secret of a fulfilling

58:07.360 --> 58:14.640
and happy life, we need to be able to rediscover the sense of awe or wonder. And flow would just

58:14.640 --> 58:20.800
become an infinite series of pieces like a goods train. There'd be discarding of all tacit forms

58:20.800 --> 58:26.240
of knowing, everything having to be explicit, network of small complicated rules strangling us.

58:26.240 --> 58:34.960
This is what the top fill saw in America in 1837. That was a very prescient man. And we would be like

58:36.400 --> 58:41.840
Descartes proudly calling ourselves spectators rather than actors in the world sitting on the

58:41.840 --> 58:48.800
sofa with a six-pack, watching it all go by on the telly. And all this would be accompanied by

58:48.800 --> 58:54.160
a dangerously unwarranted optimism. Well, thank goodness we don't live in that world.

58:58.160 --> 59:07.440
So this is my last words, values. Shaila created this pyramid of values. And I say these are the

59:07.440 --> 59:13.040
only ones that we now respect, the values of utility and pleasure. All the other ones, what

59:13.040 --> 59:22.880
he meant by Laban's verta was courage, magnanimity, fidelity, generosity. All of that seems to be the

59:22.880 --> 59:27.920
sort of thing that nowadays only suckers do that. And other people profit from it. So why would you

59:27.920 --> 59:33.520
do that? Why don't it just be a dog with each dog? Values of the intellect, geistig verta, of course

59:33.520 --> 59:38.880
you know that geist means both mind and soul. These would be things like beauty, goodness and

59:38.880 --> 59:44.720
truth, the platonic virtues. And at the top is das Heilige, the holy. And I believe we have inverted

59:44.720 --> 59:50.320
this. So in our left hemisphere world, the holy is just a fiction that enables certain priests to

59:50.320 --> 59:56.080
have power. The values of the intellect are really just to do with sexual selection. The values of

59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.600
vitality, as I say, are those espoused by people who don't know any better. And thank God they do

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.000
because we can take advantage of them. And really it's all in the service of use and pleasure.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:13.200
Well, we live in an upside down world, my friends. This is where we are now. We've lost value. We

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:20.080
have a lust for the power to manipulate, which is the left emitter's raison d'etre. We seem to have

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:25.520
lost any sense of purpose, because we think of purpose in the utilitarian way. The purpose of the

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.440
of the copy of the copying machine is to

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:41.520
purpose the copying machine and whereas we have a purpose, even when it's not a utilitarian

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:48.320
purpose. And lastly, there's a blaring of boundaries between truth and falsehood now.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:55.440
There's a war on truth, basically, all around us, from politicians and from various sectors

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:03.840
of society, which is that of bureaucracy and AI, turning everything that is living into

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:09.760
a series of processes. And I can talk, as you can well imagine, for a very great

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:22.880
deal of time about those and have done on other occasions that I'm not going to do now. Thank you.
