0	14800	Okay, so I feel like I am the luckiest and happiest corpus callosum, separating and
14800	20600	reaching these two gentlemen, Ima Gilchrist and Rupert Sheldrake. I've had the honor
20600	25560	and pleasure to spend many hours in conversation with you two, and we're here at Rupert's
25560	32560	house because we've recorded a series of conversations with Rupert and also with Iain. The last
32560	36680	one covering his book The Matter With Things, and so we couldn't miss this opportunity to
36680	41800	be the three of us, and especially you two in conversation, so I'm really glad we're
41800	51080	doing this. So am I. Me too. So let's start with any curiosity back and forth, maybe
51080	56320	from Rupert about the hemisphere apothesis, and perhaps from me and Rupert about morphic
56320	62440	resonance, and then see where we go. All right. Well, I confess I haven't read the whole of
62440	68200	your book, but I've read several chats of it, and I've watched many of your talks and
68200	73640	so on, and one thing I deduced is that it's something to do with the two hemispheres of
73640	82000	the brain. That has come through quite loud and clear in every chapter, and there are
82000	89840	two things I'm curious about, about the hemispheres and your chosen central terrain. One is that
89840	97400	when people started doing these split brain operations, they were done, I think for epileptics
97400	102160	mainly, weren't they? They severed the corpus callosum that joins the two halves of the
102160	110160	brain together, and this enabled Sperry and other scientists to look at the lateralization
110160	114560	of function in the two hemispheres, and they had to do very sophisticated experiments to
114560	122280	show this, that all that leads to this idea of differentiated function. But the bit that
122280	130680	interests me is that they were doing these operations on patients who had their brain
130680	135320	split in two, or at least all down to, there were still a few connections in the basal
135320	140200	brain, but largely severed the connections between them, and the reason they were able
140200	146640	to do this and go on doing it was because when people went home, it seemed to have solved
146640	152920	the seizure problem, and they seemed perfectly normal. And for me, that's the most astonishing
152920	157640	thing of all in this research, that people who had had their brain completely cut in
157640	163240	two, not completely, but largely cut in two, worked to coordinate the movements of both
163240	171000	sides of their body, their mouth moved, coordinated as they spoke, their spouses and loved ones
171000	178120	hardly noticed any difference. And for me, that suggests either that the nervous connections
178120	186200	to the two halves of the brain are completely or largely unnecessary, which is very surprising,
186200	192440	or that the coordination between the two halves of the brain, which must be there in order
192440	198040	to walk and speak and swim and dance and do all the normal movements of life. I'm just
198080	203280	talking about motor coordination here, not just about, you know, the more sophisticated
203280	209720	cognitive functions, that then there must be still some coordination to the two halves
209720	214680	of the brain. And for me, that suggests there's a kind of resonance between the two halves
214680	220680	of the brain resonate, either electromagnetically or through something like morphic resonance,
220680	226880	that there's an overall wholeness within which these two parts are coordinated by resonance.
226880	232880	They're not coordinated by direct nervous connections, as one might otherwise have assumed.
232880	237520	So for me, it raises a completely different view of how the brain may actually work and
237520	244520	how the two hemispheres may be coordinated. What would you think about that? I mean, why
244520	250760	is it that severing the connection of corpus callosum that links the two halves has so
250760	252640	little manifest effect?
253400	257800	The first thing to say is that the corpus callosum, many people don't realize, is a
257800	264480	mammalian invention. So although reptiles, amphibians, and many other creatures lower
264480	273480	down that tree have two centers in their brain, they're not connected in this direct way.
273480	279840	Corpus callosum started with the first mammals. The second thing I think that's worth reflecting
279840	285800	on is that it's not uncommon for people to be born with what's called colossal age
285800	290240	genesis, in other words, they don't have a corpus callosum, and it's often a chance
290240	298240	finding a postmortem. So quite clearly, the finding that you can sever the connection
298240	306680	and people can lead a reasonably normal life, almost impossible really to, if casually encountered,
306680	311520	you wouldn't notice that there was a problem. These are consonant findings and they are
311520	321920	a bit mysterious, I agree. But what they think they show is that, first of all, this direct
321920	326600	connection between the hemispheres is not the only way in which the two hemispheres can
326600	333360	communicate. For example, they very obviously share a body and the eyes and the senses take
333400	338680	in both parts of the body, so they know where, if you like, they can sense outwardly as well
338680	348240	as inwardly what's going on. Mostly in these cases, the operation was done in somebody who
348240	354880	had a longish life and had got used to the coordination of the two hemispheres. They
354880	360680	communicate with one another through the endocrine system. There are all sorts of ways in which
360880	368880	they have a common internal environment. And as you say, they communicate at the level
368880	375280	of the brainstem and even a little bit above it. So there is definitely connection there
375280	383560	of a kind. I don't know quite how to understand the resonance though, because the immediate
383560	387880	question is, I mean, when you think of things resonating, you think the brain waves from
387960	393400	this hemisphere are they literally resonating with the other hemisphere? I don't know of
393400	398960	any evidence of that. So what sort of a resonance exactly is it that they might have?
398960	406280	Well, I'm not sure, but what I think of it, say that there was a field, a morphic field
406280	411640	covering the whole brain and brain activity, that included within it the activity of the
411640	417280	two hemispheres, then the way in which they're coordinated might be through this field,
417400	423520	co-ordinating the two parts within a larger hole. And the coordination wouldn't necessarily
423520	430520	mean that one echoes the other in a most literal resonance way. But the way in which, say, the
430520	436520	different organs of the body, or say, different atoms within a molecule are coordinated within
436520	444520	a larger field. Now, if you take a molecule, a very simple molecule like H2O or CO2, the
445200	452200	atoms, the carbon and the two oxygens in carbon dioxide, are bound together by bonds. But
452200	457240	the bonds that bind them together have an electron cloud that goes around the whole molecule.
457240	462240	Covalently bonded molecules have a cloud of electrons surrounding the whole molecule,
462240	466760	like a membrane around the whole molecule. And the bond between the actual individual
466760	473280	atoms is there are shared electrons that bond them. But there's a cloud, an electron cloud,
473360	478440	around the whole thing. And the vibratory patterns of carbon and oxygen within a CO2,
478440	483800	they have different vibratory patterns, but they're coordinated together by an overall
483800	490800	field which influences both through its influence on their vibratory frequencies and coordinates
490960	496480	them and is sensitive to changes in both in a way that communicates it to the other.
496480	500560	Something like that. I mean, this is a crude model and I haven't actually tried to work
500640	507640	it out in detail. But some overarching field of whatever kind, I mean, my favorite kind
508640	515640	of morphic fields, but some overarching, organizing field in which both are parts and which coordinates
515640	520640	the two, would seem to me to be one way of thinking about this.
520640	526560	Well, immediately, of course, I think of the way in which quantum field theory suggests
526560	533560	that the way we tend to think in terms of little balls or particles is at most of metaphorical
535520	541160	meaning. And that what is being referred to there is a very particular state of something
541160	548160	that is an overall field that has energy and exerts influence. So such fields are very
549160	555440	basic. And without the idea that there is some sort of coordinating field, it's difficult
555440	562320	to explain how a simple organism, a single cell organism, can detect changes and respond
562320	569320	to them in other parts of even that cell. I mean, this is something that has been puzzled
570920	577920	over by many biologists. And there seems to be some overall coordination. And of course
578440	584880	this goes much further when you come to a multicellular organism and how do the various parts of this
584960	589560	organism know that certain things need to be responded to elsewhere in the organism?
589560	594400	Look, we don't at the moment have any way of understanding how this communication takes
594400	601400	place. Yes. You see, I think it even applies to physical systems like crystals. I mean,
601920	607000	there's a longstanding problem, as you know, with snowflakes. You know, Johannes Kepler
607000	612360	wrote a monograph on the six-sided snowflake. I didn't actually know. He did. Yes, he was
612400	617600	fascinated by snowflakes. All these people have taken wonderful pictures of snowflakes.
617600	624120	You know, Bentley is one of the great ones, the classic pictures. What you see with the
624120	630360	snowflake is they all have six sides or arms. And the six arms are the same as each other.
630360	636640	But each snowflake is different. Exactly. So the thing is, how come they're coordinated?
636640	641160	Because you could say, well, the particular branches on the thing are random to do with
641200	645480	the immediate environment. But then you'd have to say to explain the whole snowflake
645480	650920	being the same. The every arm of the growing snowflake was exactly the same on that snowflake.
650920	655440	And they're all the same just because they were in exactly the same fluctuating environment,
655440	660800	fluctuating in the same way. And the next snowflake was in a completely different environment.
660800	667800	Or you could say, as intriguingly the late editor of Nature, Sir John Maddox, no friend
668360	675120	of mine in many ways, puzzling over this question of snowflakes, said there must be some kind
675120	681120	of internal resonance within the lattice structure of the snowflake that enables it to be co-ordinated.
681120	688120	It must be reading you. Possibly. But you see, there are resonances within crystal lattices,
690280	697040	there are resonant patterns and harmonics and stuff. And so say there's a co-ordination
697080	702160	between these seemingly separate arms of the snowflake, which could depend on some kind
702160	708520	of field that's over and above the individual arms. So that's the kind of model. And one
708520	715520	would expect with any holistic model of organisms that there's a field for the entire body that
715640	721200	helps coordinate the development of the body and all the organs within it. But this field
721200	728200	also helps coordinate development of different parts. So for example, when the fingerprint
729240	735160	patterns are similar on right and left hands, and when the right and left hand side of the
735160	740840	faces are similar, they're not exactly the same, of course. But I think in normal morphogenesis
740840	746200	there's a kind of right-left resonance going on all the time, which helps coordinate bilaterally
746280	751920	symmetrical structures. Now, of course, the brain's not exactly bilaterally symmetrical
751920	758920	as one of the points that we know from its anatomy as well as its function. But some
758920	764920	overarching field that enables this to happen. That to me is why one reason I myself got
764920	769160	interested in split brains in a sense, the opposite from your own interest, which is
769160	775400	about the differences. And I was just interested in how come the co-ordination is still so
775440	781640	remarkable and so integrated that we don't experience two, most people don't experience
781640	786520	two sub-personalities all the time. And the idea of a co-ordinating field that includes
786520	793520	both and co-ordinates both would help to explain why we don't go around with right-hand
795000	801200	Rupert and left-hand Rupert, one with a wonderfully integrated view of the world and the other
801320	804240	with a kind of obsessive literal one.
804240	811240	Is your question perhaps rephrased by saying, is there an organizing principle that unites
811440	815280	the master and his emissary? Or can the master do it on its own?
815280	820640	No, I think one way of thinking about what you're talking about is that just as in the
820640	825280	developing organism there needs to be differentiation, say that on one side of the body there'll
825360	832360	be a liver on the other, you know, spleen and so on. These things are also part of a single
833120	840120	overarching field, if you like. And the brain could be seen as similarly asymmetrical, but
840960	847720	part of that asymmetry is already part of a single field. I think you must have been
847720	854480	reading McGilchrist, actually, because of course I have wonderful images of snowflakes, actually,
854520	861480	and talk about exactly this issue, which also occurs in deer antlers, for example.
861480	867040	Deer antlers have a particular form peculiar to that deer. If you cut them off, they regenerate
867040	874040	exactly according to that pattern, but where this pattern is stored is not known. So overall
874040	879800	we have problems that are generally neglected because they're difficult to answer, but as
879840	885080	soon as you start thinking about it in a more inquiring way, which I would have thought
885080	890280	was the point of science, that's a difficult question. How is it that these things have
890280	897280	this overall confusion? I mean, no, for example, in the brain, I forget the exact figure, but
898160	904660	it's something staggering, like 500,000 neurons are generated every minute in the business
904700	911700	of gestation in the womb, and all those neurons have to end up precisely in the right place
912420	918420	in the brain, and the brain has minute architectural... Where exactly is this information stored
918420	925420	about the three-dimensional structure alone of the brain? I don't think it can be even
925420	932420	encoded in simple linear code in the sense that we think of code. Of course, we've now
932580	936780	dropped the idea that it's a taller linear code in the way the computer is coded, but
936780	941780	instead must be a three-dimensional code, and so we know about the conformation in epigenetics
941780	948780	of the genes involved. But nonetheless, where is this... You don't see anywhere in that
950300	957300	this intricate three-dimensional structure stored, and the simplest thing I can imagine
958060	964100	is that there is some overarching field. Can I just add a couple of other amusing or interesting
964100	971100	things? I mean, one is the striking fact that people who are born without limbs nonetheless
971100	976660	have the sense of the limbs. They've never had them, but nonetheless, they have an internal
976660	983660	sense of those limbs, and Ramachandra describes a woman who had no limbs, no upper limbs,
984660	990660	having phantom limbs, which she couldn't stop gesticulating when she talked. So this
990660	997660	part of evolutionary history, the hand movements are coordinated with speech, was there in
997660	1002340	her, although she had never experienced hands or arms. The other thing, which is raised
1002340	1009340	by F. S. Schiller, the Victorian philosopher, Oxford philosopher, which is a very good
1009340	1015340	point, is we know, of course, that when people have damage to one part of the brain, other
1015340	1021340	parts of the brain can take over the function. But how is this coordinated? How does one
1021340	1027340	part of the brain that's supposedly doing whatever it does know we need speech? How
1027340	1033340	are we going to get it back? I mean, in a way, there's a need for something overarching
1034340	1040340	to draw out that function in a new place in the brain.
1040340	1046340	Well, of course, my own starting point for my ideas on morphogenetic resonance was morphogenetic
1046340	1051340	fields, form-shaping fields. And I started my scientific career working on plant development.
1051340	1052340	Yes.
1052340	1059340	And how is it that leaves and flowers and stem ends and so on develop? And the idea of morphogenetic
1060340	1067340	fields, first put forward in the 1920s, was exactly that of a coordinating field that
1067340	1073340	brings forth these patterns, and underlies regeneration. And so, for example, in the
1077340	1084340	regeneration of salamander eyes, so-called wolfian regeneration, you cut out the lens
1084340	1090340	of the eye of a new torus salamander, and it will regenerate new lens from the edge of
1090340	1095340	the iris, which is not how the lens forms in the embryo, it forms by folding in the skin
1095340	1102340	from the outside. So there's a completely filling and missing structure by modifying
1102340	1109340	some other structure would never normally be modified to create, to fill that function.
1110340	1117340	And all this similar kind of coordination applies in social insects. If you remove some
1117340	1123340	of the workers, or remove some of the soldiers, or remove some of the hive, or something. The
1123340	1128340	whole system re-adjusts, they stop doing what they're doing, some of them take on different
1128340	1135340	functions and roles. So these coordinating fields, I think, underlie all of biology,
1135340	1142340	all of nature of self-organizing systems. And phantom limbs are particularly interesting
1142340	1148340	because I think in a phantom limb, the phantom is the field of the limb which is experienced
1148340	1154340	from within, but which doesn't have a material structure associated with it. And as you may
1154340	1160340	know, one of the experiments that I proposed in my book Seven Experiments That Could Change
1160340	1167340	the World is on detecting phantom limbs. I recruit amputees through veterans' organizations,
1167340	1173340	tried recruiting them through hospitals, but they were extremely uncooperative. And then
1173340	1180340	I have the phantom amputee, but they push their phantom arm through one of six positions
1180340	1188340	in a barrier, a door, for example. And on the other side, that's done in a randomized sequence,
1188340	1194340	on the other side, I have people who do subtle energy medicine, Reiki, Helos, and so on. And
1194340	1199340	one at a time, I lead them in, I say, one of those panels has a phantom arm sticking through
1199340	1204340	it, and the others don't, which has got the phantom, and they sort of feel in different
1204340	1210340	places. And they say that one, and they write more than chance so far, substantially more
1210340	1215340	than chance. So the main objection I've had to this is, well, how do you know it's not
1215340	1222340	telepathy? If we've moved, if the skeptic of the argument says, it must be telepathy,
1222340	1227340	and we've moved it. That's beautiful. Yes, yes. But then, as a test for that, I haven't
1227340	1232340	done this yet, but the control, the telepathy control is you ask them to imagine pushing
1232340	1237340	their phantom arm through, or you ask them to extend their phantom arm with a step back
1237340	1242340	yard or two to start with and extend it so it doesn't actually go through the door.
1242340	1249340	And so that would be another control. Now, these experiments are not expensive. In fact,
1249340	1256340	they're free. So I think that actually this whole question can be taken much further. This
1256340	1265340	is not the kind of thing people do in labs at the moment, but they could. But before
1266340	1273340	we leave the subject of the divided brain and all that, I have a more, probably a simpler
1273340	1281340	easy to answer question. You could probably refer me to page 3027 in your Magnum Office,
1281340	1290340	which is, I'm a pianist, and so obviously playing the piano involves coordinating the
1290340	1296340	right and the left hand. And the left hand, which mainly does the rhythmic section as
1296340	1302340	well, is clearly controlled by the right brain. And the right hand, which does the sort of
1302340	1309340	melody and all the rest is by the left brain. And in playing the piano, these are coordinated.
1309340	1315340	And how does this map on to your interpretation? I'm sure it maps wonderfully well, but I just
1315340	1321340	love to know how. Well, one of the mysteries is that music is abnormally lateralized in
1321340	1328340	the brain of performers. So in the general population who are not professional musicians
1328340	1336340	or full-time musicians, the only bit of music that is really understood or interpreted by
1336340	1345340	the left hemisphere is rhythm. And melody and harmony are almost exclusively understood
1345340	1351340	and experienced in the right hemisphere. So that seems on the face of it very different
1351340	1359340	from what you're describing. And one of the things is that for most instruments, the two
1359340	1363340	hands need to be coordinated for all these activities. And so when you look at professional
1363340	1370340	musicians, what I've just described is not the case. So they have developed a left hemisphere
1370340	1376340	which is also capable of understanding melody and harmony. And the right hemisphere already
1376340	1382340	actually understands rhythm anyway. In fact, complex rhythms in the ordinary person are
1382340	1386340	understood by the right hemisphere, not by the left. It's only simple rhythms the left
1386340	1392340	can get. The sort of thing that I constantly hear everywhere I go, blaring out of cars
1392340	1397340	on speakers in shops and so on, which is just boom, boom, boom. That is the left hemisphere
1397340	1404340	speaking. But I think what you're describing is an effortful coordination which actually
1404340	1410340	modifies the brain. I see. Because you see, I thought on the basic, I mean my understanding
1410340	1417340	of McGillchrist 101 was that actually the right and left hand should be reversed. And there's
1417340	1422340	no reason why when the development of piano playing took place, the keyboards shouldn't
1422340	1427340	have been the other way round. With the deep notes at the top. Yes. Well, yes, with the
1427340	1432340	keyboard reversed. So you play with the left hemisphere, the right hand would do the rhythm
1432340	1437340	and the left hand would do, I mean it could have been exactly the mirror image of the
1437340	1443340	way it is now. There's nothing in the technology that says it has to be that way round. It's
1443340	1449340	quite right. I never really thought about that. I think that you'd have to have had,
1449340	1457340	not just a reversal of, you'd have to have had the higher notes on the left hands part
1457340	1462340	of the scale. Yes. That's right. The thing is that in the brain there are certain things
1462340	1470340	that are positionally, it seems like, for example, the sequence from left to right in which things
1470340	1479340	grow is innate in, for example, chicks. They tend to see that a series of numbers grows
1479340	1484340	as you move towards the right, which is the way in which we see from one to itself. And
1484340	1490340	so we start from lower to higher. And it may be that this is also the way in which it seems
1490340	1498340	fundamentally that the lower notes are basic. They are the base. And the other is what is
1498340	1504340	built more complexly on top of it. And so it may be natural that an instrument developed
1504340	1509340	in this way. But I haven't studied all instruments around the world to see whether or not there's
1509340	1514340	a project for somebody with nothing else to do. Well, look at Islamic music, you see,
1514340	1519340	because they read from right to left. Yes. And so their whole sense of the way things
1519340	1524340	develop. Yes. You start at the back of the book by our criteria and you read from right
1524340	1529340	to left. It's the exact opposite. Of course. If pianos had first been developed in the
1529340	1536340	Caliphate, in Baghdad or somewhere, perhaps the upper part of the keyboard would have been
1536340	1542340	the lower notes and the rhythm section, and it might have been a mirror image of existing pianos.
1542340	1547340	It's a hypothetical, but some research, anthropological search, would be interesting.
1547340	1552340	Yes. I don't know why it's ended up that way in brief, but that is the way it is. And
1552340	1559340	it's also true, of course, of all instruments. I don't know of any instruments that are just
1559340	1564340	played with one hand. I mean, it's one of the things we do, even with sort of playing a flute,
1564340	1569340	playing a violin. Both hands have to be coordinated, at least in Western music, that is,
1569340	1576340	almost as I think we know. So the hands have to work together in this way, and the brain
1576340	1581340	is modified in those who do it, so that it can. I wonder how much learning the piano,
1581340	1587340	you see, I started learning piano when I was five. I come from a musical family. And my son,
1587340	1593340	Merlin, learned at five, Cosmo, who started learning at four. And that means from a very early
1593340	1600340	age, they and lots and lots of other people have actually been using brains in a way that
1600340	1609340	would be somewhat counterintuitive if they read McGillchrist first. So does this affect
1609340	1614340	the actual development? Do people who learn the piano or other instruments at an early
1614340	1620340	age develop differently? I mean, professional musicians, you said, are noticeably different.
1620340	1623340	But what about amateur musicians who play every day?
1623340	1628340	Well, of course, the distinction is not between amateur and professional, but between people
1628340	1633340	who are constantly playing and those who are only occasionally playing. So I don't think
1633340	1640340	there's a problem with that. But I would imagine that starting early to learn an instrument
1640340	1646340	like this will modify, certainly we know in respect of the appreciation of sound that
1646340	1651340	it does modify the brain. And I don't see why it should not modify the brain in other
1651340	1657340	ways. You and your two sons have interesting brains that work perhaps slightly different
1657340	1667340	from the standard Western brain. Yes. Yes. Well, that's a really interesting possibility,
1667340	1674340	isn't it? I don't know if anybody has done more tests on professional pianists or, you
1674340	1679340	know, I don't know of any. No. Well, it would be a good research area from the point of view
1679340	1684340	of brain naturalization, wouldn't it? Absolutely. When I have seen reports saying the people
1684340	1690340	who learn the piano or other instruments have a different way in which they think and stuff.
1690340	1696340	Okay. But it would be an obvious thing to do because this involves a close coordination
1696340	1703340	of the two hemispheres in a way that, I mean, we need it in every physical activity, walking,
1703340	1708340	running, jumping, sports skills, presumably, you know, playing cricket, playing football,
1708340	1714340	etc., right and left feet. Presumably all these physical skills involve coordination
1714340	1719340	of hemispheres. Well, they do, but the difference is that the left hemisphere and the right
1719340	1725340	hemisphere and motor performance each control the other. And there's not the, you know,
1725340	1730340	there's the distinction that there is between melody, harmony and rhythm, if you see what
1730340	1737340	I mean. Yes. So music introduces a whole different aspect. Yes. There's no reason to suppose
1737340	1743340	that we should be discoordinated when we move. And then animals that have no corpus callosum
1743340	1749340	are perfectly well coordinated. You know, this question of yours could be scaled up to
1749340	1756340	in asking how could we nurture young brains so that they have an easier time to grasp the
1756340	1762340	world as you've proposed in your book or another way to put it would be how to nurture the
1762340	1768340	Ruperts and eons of the future, which is something I'm very concerned with. What can we do to
1768340	1774340	facilitate those intuitions that you both have been pursuing in different ways, but
1774340	1782340	scientifically and beyond? You know, if you have some thoughts on that. Well, one thought
1782340	1789340	I have that seems relevant is that I think that to the extent that what you're asking
1789340	1798340	for is people who think more flexibly. There is a problem with dogma in both in philosophy
1798340	1806340	and in science. It's a natural tendency for things to ossify, to fix prematurely and not
1806340	1814340	allow evolution. It's natural for thought to evolve. And to do this, it has to be creative.
1815340	1829340	And the best kinds of thinking that will allow this are those in which analytic acumen is
1829340	1835340	there, but coupled with rather like the left and the right hand, coupled with a more imaginative
1835340	1843340	and intuitive way of thinking. And I describe the insights of many scientists and mathematicians
1843340	1849340	and it's quite extraordinary how virtually all of them describe this so-called ah-ha
1849340	1857340	moment as being the creative thing that reveals the new Gestalt. And this ah-ha moment is
1857340	1863340	robustly associated with the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus of the right hemisphere.
1863340	1868340	So we know that this is right hemisphere, mediate it. And the trouble with our education now
1868340	1873340	is that it's very much technically orientated. More and more we're saying what's the point
1873340	1878340	in teaching people unless it's teaching them some mechanical skill that will be useful to them.
1878340	1886340	But in fact, the point of an education is to draw out of us our humanity. And humanity used to be
1886340	1894340	part of what we discussed in school, the humanities. And I think that a greater emphasis on music,
1894340	1900340	on poetry, which also involves very largely the right hemisphere, whereas ordinary
1900340	1906340	discursive language is probably more dependent on the left hemisphere than on both.
1906340	1914340	These ways of thinking should be part of the way we educate children. What do you say, Rupert?
1914340	1922340	Yes. Well, I think there are some forms of education like sports, physical skills,
1922340	1928340	crafts, which are part of education. I mean, they're always being squeezed out by the senses
1928340	1937340	on more science, more literacy, more language, more learning. I think training other skills
1937340	1944340	like intuitive abilities and emotional intelligence, all these things, they seem to be really important.
1944340	1950340	But we've got a system of education which is designed for, well, basically it follows
1950340	1957340	from Victorian design, doesn't it, of preparing people for life in an industrial society.
1957340	1962340	One thing is to make children used to getting up and showing up for school at nine o'clock
1962340	1967340	in the morning and fixed hours, I mean, which you need in an industrial society,
1967340	1973340	disciplining from an early age. And I think a lot of it's about that.
1973340	1975340	I think that's very important myself.
1975340	1980340	It's important, but it's not primarily about creativity.
1980340	1982340	Obviously so.
1982340	1989340	Actually, for most people, I don't think creativity is, I don't think we necessarily need to have creativity
1989340	1994340	built into the entire educational system because it's a major disadvantage.
1994340	1999340	It's a disadvantage for a lot of people to be creative. I mean, if you've got a regular job
1999340	2005340	and you're creative, you're going to have an awfully difficult time.
2005340	2008340	Most jobs require lack of creativity.
2008340	2010340	Yes.
2010340	2017340	And, you know, I went into the scientific career believing that the importance of scientists
2017340	2024340	be original and creative. And I soon discovered there was every obstacle to doing that.
2024340	2035340	You know, whenever I'm trying to be or am being or, you know, doing something that seems to me original and creative,
2035340	2040340	instead of people saying how wonderful, I mean, the vast majority of people say rubbish, nonsense,
2040340	2046340	where's the evidence, etc. And if you have the evidence and you do an experiment you think is creative,
2046340	2050340	you say, well, you've got these results, but where's the theory?
2050340	2062340	You know, and as Alex sometimes says, you know, one of the responses I get to my research on telepathy
2062340	2067340	and things like that is, you know, it's all very well in practice, but does it work in theory?
2067340	2069340	Yes, it does.
2069340	2074340	So actually originality is a major disadvantage for a lot of people.
2074340	2078340	Well, it may be, but it depends what we mean by an education.
2078340	2084340	If we mean simply preparing people for routine jobs, then we're limiting their potential
2084340	2089340	and we're prescribing what is valued in society.
2089340	2096340	Whereas if we were to encourage some people, definitely need their originality enhancing
2096340	2100340	or not even enhancing but liberating, I think it's there in a lot of people.
2100340	2105340	But it does need disciplining as well. This is why I see that both parts are important.
2105340	2111340	I think that modern education both lacks discipline and lacks originality.
2111340	2117340	It's about sticking information into people inefficiently and then hoping they can regurgitate it later.
2117340	2119340	But that's not an education at all.
2119340	2124340	An education is about enabling something that is innate to grow.
2124340	2130340	But that growth also, if you like, needs a formal field in which to grow.
2130340	2136340	And that should be provided by good teachers and was, I hope for you and certainly was for me,
2136340	2145340	by highly disciplined, intellectually acute, but also imaginatively inspired teachers from whom I learned.
2145340	2147340	You know, this was extraordinarily important.
2147340	2152340	Now, I was very lucky too with my teachers at school and at university.
2152340	2156340	But I mean, what I want to emphasize is it's not about letting it all hang out.
2156340	2159340	I mean, there was an enormous amount of discipline.
2159340	2163340	You know, at an early age, one had to know trigonometry and calculus.
2163340	2166340	One had to be able to understand Greek grammar and Latin grammar, all these things.
2166340	2168340	And these are difficult.
2168340	2172340	I mean, there are all things that you get by sort of going, oh, well, whatever.
2172340	2175340	I mean, they really require serious application.
2175340	2178340	And one does need that structure.
2178340	2183340	And I believe that in learning a skill, and you talked about that,
2183340	2185340	and you're talking about manual skills largely.
2185340	2187340	I think they're very important crafts and skills.
2187340	2191340	But to begin with, you have to do rather laborious copying of things.
2191340	2196340	But then you're in the position to be able to go further than that.
2196340	2199340	But you need that first element to be there before you can go further.
2199340	2204340	I mean, I didn't write this book out of not knowing anything about neuroscience or, you know,
2204340	2207340	years of hard work involved.
2207340	2210340	And your work, it also involves years of hard work, I know.
2210340	2213340	It's that commute from right to left to right that you mentioned, right?
2213340	2216340	Yes, it needs to go from right to left and back to right.
2216340	2223340	By which I mean that one's first apprehension of something is a perceptive and imaginative understanding.
2223340	2227340	And then one needs to, as we learn more, by the process of analysis
2227340	2230340	and seeing the structure of what one's doing
2230340	2233340	and making comparisons and putting things together in a certain way.
2233340	2235340	But they must never stop there.
2235340	2237340	That is an intermediary phase.
2237340	2245340	And then it needs to be reintegrated into a new whole in which that laborious analysis has been not lost
2245340	2250340	because that suggests that it was pointless, but it had its point at a certain period in time.
2250340	2254340	What your discussion reminds me of the simple organisms I used to study,
2254340	2256340	E. coli, how they navigate the world.
2256340	2259340	It's like learning to tumble and learning to run.
2259340	2261340	They need to run and tumble.
2261340	2266340	So in a way, a certain dose of dogmatism is needed to just keep on going for some while
2266340	2268340	because it would stop at every point.
2268340	2270340	To reconceive that you would get nowhere.
2270340	2273340	But if you don't stop and tumble, then you also go nowhere.
2273340	2275340	So it's this balance in a way.
2275340	2277340	It's very interesting.
2277340	2284340	And of course science needs to balance its openness to change and newness
2284340	2289340	and its willingness to stick to certain things unless there's a good reason for moving on.
2289340	2292340	Otherwise it would be changing its mind about everything all the time.
2292340	2297340	So everything in life is a matter of balancing things
2297340	2303340	and coming to a position which honours and respects and enhances by integrating
2303340	2307340	the two things that we think are separate in some way, but they're not really separate.
2307340	2309340	I agree.
2309340	2313340	Now let's not make of your particular biographies as a friend of mine says,
2313340	2318340	a universal category, but I'd like to hear a bit about your own paths
2318340	2325340	because it's clear that you've gone through the margins or the edge.
2325340	2326340	You could even say cutting edge.
2326340	2328340	You haven't followed the prescribed path.
2328340	2332340	At your risk, you've succeeded.
2332340	2335340	That's why maybe we don't have your other people who didn't make it,
2335340	2339340	but you've made it and in a way your paths are similar in that respect.
2339340	2346340	And what does that tell us as a model or what it doesn't tell us as a model for other people?
2346340	2350340	Well, I suppose we're both feral academics
2350340	2355340	and we were both fellows of colleges in Oxford, me at Cambridge
2355340	2363340	and we somehow escaped from domestication and lived in the wild.
2363340	2365340	As much in the wild as you.
2365340	2371340	I mean, you were treated to the fastnesses of the Western Isles.
2371340	2375340	I'm merely on the edge of Hampstead Heath.
2377340	2381340	But I find, I don't know if you do, that very often now,
2381340	2384340	and I didn't think this was always the case, but very often now,
2384340	2392340	the really interesting ideas are coming forth from places that are not in the middle of the mainstream.
2392340	2397340	They're coming from people who are working on their own or working in small groups
2397340	2402340	and these are producing highly interesting and imaginative propositions
2402340	2407340	whereas in the mainstream there's far too much emphasis on not stepping out of line,
2407340	2412340	not rocking the boat, and if you say something that isn't what your colleagues are saying,
2412340	2416340	then you won't get promoted, you won't get a grant and all the rest.
2416340	2418340	So it must be deadening actually living like that
2418340	2422340	and I'm just not prepared to live like that and I don't expect you to be a writer.
2422340	2426340	No, no, but it does.
2426340	2430340	I mean, it's not a career path one can recommend to other people
2430340	2436340	because it's not very easy to survive outside the framework of regular salaries.
2436340	2442340	Alex is a uniquely privileged being Spanish in a way that we can't be being British
2442340	2447340	because being a scientist in Spain is to be part of the civil service
2447340	2451340	and once you've got tenure as he has, then you've got it for life
2451340	2454340	and so he can do what he likes.
2454340	2458340	So he's in a uniquely privileged position of having an actual salary
2458340	2462340	which neither of you or I have had for a very long time
2462340	2467340	and the freedom to be inquiring into all these things
2467340	2472340	and talking to you and me and investigating all sorts of areas of science
2472340	2474340	with a remarkable freedom.
2474340	2476340	Two caveats here.
2476340	2480340	One is once you've got tenure, that's one caveat
2480340	2483340	and what has happened to those who didn't get it
2483340	2486340	and were perhaps more valuable
2486340	2491340	and also those who got it, how the whole process has shaped their minds, that's one thing
2491340	2495340	and the second paradox is I have many colleagues who got tenure
2495340	2500340	but they continue, I mean, probably some of them may want to continue doing what they're doing
2500340	2504340	but even having tenure, like some people say, I'll wait until I retire
2504340	2507340	and then I'll write that book or that idea
2507340	2511340	and perhaps that's also a good idea to do it later but maybe it's too late.
2511340	2513340	Maybe it's too late often, I think.
2513340	2518340	One you need to get to tenure and even if you get there, it's no guarantee for anything of that.
2518340	2521340	No, it doesn't guarantee people or take you seriously.
2521340	2526340	I mean, I used to think that people who got the Nobel Prize
2526340	2530340	would have enough confidence to do and say what they think and would be taken seriously
2530340	2533340	but actually even the Nobel Prize is no guarantee.
2533340	2536340	Brian Josephson, for example, at Cambridge,
2536340	2541340	well, as soon as he got interest in psychic phenomena and the nature of consciousness
2542340	2547340	although he's a professor with tenure, as a Nobel laureate, a fellow of Trinity College,
2547340	2554340	his colleagues make sure he doesn't get students and that he's marginalized, etc.
2554340	2559340	because his views are untenable in their eyes.
2559340	2567340	So even the Nobel Prize and tenure, it may guarantee a certain freedom of manoeuvre
2567340	2572340	but it doesn't guarantee that what one does will have much influence.
2572340	2576340	The influence is perhaps another matter but I haven't found that, I mean,
2576340	2580340	largely being in the mainstream race of my life has impeded me.
2580340	2583340	I mean, because I was, you know, I was a fellow of Oxford College
2583340	2590340	and I became a psychiatrist and director at the Bethelman Morsley Hospital in London
2590340	2593340	which is of all the institutions of mental health,
2593340	2597340	one of the most, you know, central in the world.
2597340	2606340	And I was salaried but of course there was freedom to use what one saw and think in another way
2606340	2608340	and I think it's open to more people than one thinks.
2608340	2611340	They don't have to go out completely on a limb
2611340	2616340	but if you look at what you experience and think about it in a deeper, broader context,
2616340	2618340	you see something different.
2618340	2623340	And I just think that an awful lot of people see what they're doing in science
2623340	2629340	as sort of self-evident and not raising further questions.
2629340	2633340	It's a rather unusual kind of mind that asks the question,
2633340	2636340	so why does it actually do that? Why does it work like that?
2636340	2645340	And I have found one of the best books on this topic is Erwin Chargaff's
2645340	2648340	autobiography, Heraklite and Fire.
2648340	2653340	You know, he was a very great, honoured biochemist at Yale
2653340	2660340	who laid the groundwork for Crick and Watson and so on, the author of Chargaff's Rules,
2660340	2667340	but he writes brilliantly and with enormous imagination about what he sees science to be
2667340	2676340	and he contrasts it with this extremely deadening, simple following out of linear paths.
2676340	2680340	I think it's partly a result of the massive expansion and professionalisation of science.
2680340	2681340	Exactly.
2681340	2685340	I mean, so he would say in World War, it becomes a career path.
2685340	2689340	It was a struggle. In the 19th century a lot of scientists in Britain
2689340	2694340	were either amateurs like Charles Darwin who never had an academic job.
2694340	2699340	Faraday was at the Royal Institution, not in the university,
2699340	2703340	in a rather eccentric small institution.
2703340	2710340	But when it became professionalised, something that T. H. Huxley was one of the drivers of in Britain,
2710340	2715340	to make science a professional, like a priesthood,
2715340	2719340	where only people who got the right degrees and qualifications could teach it
2719340	2722340	and influence people through universities.
2722340	2727340	The school system and what was taught in schools and all that was professionalised.
2727340	2729340	And then you've got to have the right qualifications.
2729340	2734340	His aim was to squeeze out country vicos who did wonderful natural history,
2734340	2736340	who believed in God.
2736340	2739340	He thought no one in science should believe in God, or if they did,
2739340	2743340	it should be kept at least very much their private life.
2743340	2745340	You've got to have two priestshoods.
2745340	2752340	That's right. You have one priesthood and then this model of scientists as priests
2752340	2755340	then spread to the Soviet Union.
2755340	2759340	Scientists were the highest rank of the intellectuals and all that kind of thing.
2759340	2762340	And so it became all over the world.
2762340	2768340	In countries like India and China, engineers and scientists are very, very high prestige.
2768340	2774340	They're not terribly high prestige in Britain because they're regarded as boffins and geeks and things.
2775340	2779340	The highest prestige goes to people who've been to Eaton and Oxford
2779340	2784340	and who belong to the Bollinger Club and become conservative prime ministers,
2784340	2786340	at least for a while.
2786340	2792340	So they don't know that the person you're referring to currently enjoys great esteem in the country.
2792340	2795340	No, no. It's only temporary.
2795340	2798340	It shows these things are always temporary.
2798340	2803340	But still, the point is that in Britain, scientists have never commanded,
2803340	2807340	Newton's being venerated and Darwin's being venerated and so on,
2807340	2814340	but it's never been like there's quite the priesthood level that it achieves in many other countries.
2814340	2818340	But nevertheless, it's the idea is of a kind of priesthood.
2818340	2823340	And then you've got all the ranks of the sort of deacons and sub-deacons and stuff.
2823340	2826340	It becomes a whole professional thing. Then it becomes a career.
2826340	2831340	And when I lived in India, I worked with Indian scientists.
2831340	2835340	I was an Indian International Scientific Institute.
2835340	2839340	Most of my Indian scientific colleagues had not gone into science
2839340	2842340	because of a deep curiosity about nature.
2842340	2845340	They'd gone into it because their parents believed in education
2845340	2850340	and science and medicine and engineering were the three top careers.
2850340	2854340	And so any bright children had been pushed into that
2854340	2858340	and pushed in their studies and pushed through the university.
2858340	2863340	And then they got jobs in high prestige institutions if they worked hard enough.
2863340	2868340	And their whole social status and the ability to marry off their daughters
2868340	2872340	to more prestigious husbands in an arranged marriage system
2872340	2875340	moved them up the social scale instead.
2875340	2878340	It wasn't at all about curiosity for most of them.
2878340	2884340	And I think for many scientists today here in Britain,
2884340	2888340	it's not primarily about deep curiosity about nature.
2888340	2892340	It's about being a functionary within a system.
2892340	2898340	Well, as Whitehead said, this divorce between science and philosophy
2898340	2901340	has been a congestion of both.
2901340	2907340	And I think that science properly understood is a form of philosophy.
2907340	2913340	It's an investigation of philosophy in certain particular empirical methods.
2913340	2917340	But it has philosophical implications
2917340	2921340	and it draws on philosophical principles that it's outset.
2921340	2923340	You may not understand that it does that.
2923340	2926340	But that's more dangerous when people don't realize what it is they're doing.
2926340	2928340	They don't do it well.
2928340	2931340	But I think that we need to get back to the understanding
2931340	2934340	that science has philosophical meaning
2934340	2936340	and that this is not enough discussed.
2936340	2939340	If one needs philosophically minded scientists
2939340	2942340	and scientifically minded philosophers,
2942340	2945340	philosophers who are willing to spend time
2945340	2949340	learning about the science that will give them insights
2949340	2951340	into the forming of their philosophy.
2951340	2955340	Well, I mean, here in Britain the word science wasn't introduced
2955340	2957340	until the 19th century.
2957340	2960340	And before that it was called natural philosophy.
2960340	2964340	And Newton's great book, Principia Mathematica,
2964340	2968340	the mathematical principles of natural philosophy.
2969340	2972340	So I think that natural philosophy
2972340	2975340	is actually a really good word and for it.
2975340	2979340	I'm a member of the main Cambridge University Scientific Society
2979340	2982340	which is called the Cambridge Philosophical Society.
2982340	2987340	Because when it was started in the early 19th century
2987340	2991340	it was called natural philosophy as Cambridge.
2991340	2995340	I subscribed to biological reviews
2995340	2998340	which was on the main review journals in biology,
2998340	3001340	the subtitles of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.
3001340	3005340	So I think natural philosophy is what you are.
3005340	3008340	I like to think it's what I and Alex are too.
3008340	3011340	And I think that probably most people who listen to us
3011340	3013340	are natural philosophers.
3013340	3018340	And so in a sense it's a matter of recovering
3018340	3022340	what was the root of what we now call science.
3022340	3027340	Before it was hijacked by this professionalization movement
3027340	3030340	and this creation of this priesthood
3030340	3035340	and making it an exclusive professional organization
3035340	3038340	that you have to obey the rules of.
3038340	3041340	One of the things I feel about the age we live in
3041340	3045340	is the predominance of the administrative or bureaucratic mind
3045340	3048340	over almost every aspect of our lives.
3048340	3051340	And I think this is deeply damaging
3051340	3054340	and I think it's an exhibition of the left hemisphere's way
3054340	3058340	of both trying to understand
3058340	3060340	but misunderstanding what it's dealing with
3060340	3062340	and above all to control it.
3062340	3065340	And I think that what has happened is that
3065340	3068340	yes, I understand the analogy with the church
3068340	3071340	but what has really happened is that something much less glamorous
3071340	3073340	has happened in science
3073340	3077340	which is simply that it's become a huge bureaucracy.
3077340	3082340	It has money to spend
3082340	3087340	which follows people who tow the party line
3087340	3089340	do more of what everyone else is doing
3089340	3095340	and it's very difficult in this sclerotic hierarchy
3095340	3100340	as it would be in the middle of an enormous Byzantine civil service
3100340	3104340	to be able to break out and see something else or do something else.
3104340	3107340	So I think the future will depend on the development
3107340	3111340	of small private colleges where people are very much
3111340	3114340	you take in only the brightest people.
3114340	3116340	I think that's very important.
3116340	3119340	We're sort of worried by the concept of elitism
3119340	3121340	but looked at another way.
3121340	3125340	Education depends on and our future depends on
3125340	3128340	people who have the capacity to think clearly
3128340	3131340	and to think imaginatively being encouraged
3131340	3135340	and that's what a good college should be doing in my view.
3135340	3139340	And so I think it's from those small institutions
3139340	3141340	which are beginning to spring up in competition
3141340	3144340	with the great universities
3144340	3147340	that the future will flourish.
3147340	3149340	And I'm sorry about that
3149340	3152340	because I have a great allegiance
3152340	3157340	for the enormously interesting and valuable history
3157340	3159340	of our great institutions.
3159340	3161340	I'm very sorry to say this
3161340	3163340	but they're beginning to turn themselves into something
3163340	3165340	that can be easily dispensed with.
3165340	3168340	How to prevent those institutions from following the same path
3168340	3172340	and also how to solve the accreditation problem there?
3172340	3176340	Because in a way that I wanted to ask you both this very question
3176340	3180340	like you have navigated outside the institutional seas
3180340	3183340	but nevertheless there's some appreciation for institutions
3183340	3185340	still in both of you.
3185340	3187340	Very much so, yes.
3187340	3191340	How much of it can we still embrace
3191340	3194340	and how much we need to just reject?
3194340	3199340	So back to the future, these future scientists and philosophers
3199340	3201340	are they going to be in institutions
3201340	3204340	and if they're not, how is the new order
3204340	3206340	or the new business going to be
3206340	3210340	in terms of accreditation and so on?
3210340	3214340	It's like designing a new Atlantis
3214340	3217340	you know, what's the new new Atlantis?
3217340	3220340	Four hundred years later.
3220340	3223340	Well I don't have a crystal ball, I don't know
3223340	3227340	but I think that what you say in the sense
3227340	3229340	that there needs to be an institution
3229340	3232340	but it may not be these institutions I think is right.
3232340	3234340	I mean everything evolves
3234340	3237340	and evolution is partly that things have their proper period
3237340	3241340	and the great universities, Oxford and Cambridge for example
3241340	3243340	have a thousand year history
3243340	3245340	they're currently committing suicide in my view
3245340	3248340	by not sticking to their guns
3248340	3253340	and so this means that other institutions will spring up
3253340	3258340	because there's a natural need to nourish those
3258340	3264340	who will benefit from being given freedom and discipline together
3264340	3267340	and the time to fulfill these things.
3267340	3270340	Let me tell you something about my own experience
3270340	3275340	which will sound horribly, you know, I don't know, unusual
3275340	3280340	but I got this fellowship at 21 of all souls
3280340	3286340	and I was to embark on a doctorate on 18th century English literature
3286340	3289340	and this fellowship was a seven year fellowship
3289340	3291340	after examination there's this strange thing
3291340	3293340	that doesn't have any equivalent to Cambridge
3293340	3295340	or anywhere else in Oxford
3295340	3297340	of a college that consists only of fellows
3297340	3300340	not of any students, graduate or otherwise
3300340	3302340	and when you become a fellow after examination
3302340	3304340	which is a three day examination
3304340	3307340	if you become one you get seven years
3307340	3311340	in which to do whatever it is that interests you intellectually
3311340	3316340	and Derek Parfit, a very well-known philosopher
3316340	3319340	said to me, don't do your doctorate
3319340	3323340	anybody can do a doctorate, that's part of the sort of machinery
3323340	3326340	but you've been given something completely extraordinary
3326340	3329340	which is seven years in which you can pursue ideas
3329340	3332340	and I thought he was absolutely right
3332340	3336340	and at the time I followed all kinds of interests
3336340	3340340	in science, in other languages, in literature, in philosophy
3340340	3345340	and at the time I thought, you know, this is wonderful
3345340	3348340	but I didn't realise until much later in my life
3348340	3350340	why it had been so important
3350340	3353340	and I'm not sure that even, I don't know enough
3353340	3355340	I mustn't speak about what I'm not certain of
3355340	3358340	but I think that the ethos of all souls is rather changed
3358340	3360340	as everything does
3360340	3364340	and there's more of that, you know, we must keep an eye on what he's reading
3364340	3366340	and has he published a paper and all that
3366340	3368340	but I was free of that
3368340	3371340	and later in life I thought, well what did I make of that?
3371340	3374340	and to me the answer came with the publication of these books
3374340	3376340	because I couldn't possibly have written them
3376340	3380340	unless I'd been allowed to range wild, as you should say
3380340	3383340	but I did it within an institution
3383340	3387340	over the fields of things from which I drew
3387340	3392340	the bigger picture I've tried to express in these books
3392340	3395340	which can only be done if you've had the ability to range
3395340	3398340	so this business of range
3398340	3402340	which is exactly the opposite of the tendency towards ever greater specialism
3402340	3404340	is very, very important
3404340	3407340	and I think that more institutions ought to
3407340	3410340	follow what happened in the 60s
3410340	3416340	which was, you know, institutions used to take people
3416340	3419340	that had proved themselves to be intelligent
3419340	3421340	and give them carte blanche
3421340	3425340	and they gave them an office, gave them an income for a few years
3425340	3429340	and then said, follow your instincts, you know, what you find interesting
3429340	3432340	and out of that came many, many inventions
3432340	3437340	Well I had a very similar period of freedom to you
3437340	3440340	and actually I feel enormously grateful for it
3440340	3443340	and I had two periods of freedom
3443340	3446340	First of all, when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge
3446340	3449340	I became increasingly disenchanted with mechanistic science
3449340	3451340	which I was studying
3451340	3455340	I started reading Goethe and I had the idea of a holistic science
3455340	3459340	and everyone assumed I'd go on and do a PhD
3459340	3461340	because I got a double first
3461340	3465340	but I wasn't sure if I wanted to
3465340	3469340	I mean I liked science but I didn't like killing animals all the time
3469340	3472340	and I didn't like treating them as machines
3472340	3475340	and the whole attitude of mechanistic science
3475340	3479340	so I found there was this fellowship at Harvard
3479340	3482340	that was open to people from Cambridge for a year
3482340	3485340	in the graduate school, I applied for it and I got it
3485340	3488340	and when I got to Harvard to do history and philosophy of science
3488340	3492340	to step back to see the bigger picture, that's what I wanted to do
3493340	3497340	I found that they treat graduate students at Harvard
3497340	3501340	in a way I hadn't been treated since I was about 15
3501340	3504340	read these pages this week, read those and we'll test you
3504340	3506340	to make sure you've read it
3506340	3508340	it was spoon feeding, there was no freedom
3508340	3510340	I tried doing what they said
3510340	3512340	and after about a month
3512340	3515340	I just couldn't do it, I mean you'd have to stay up till midnight
3515340	3517340	every night to read all this stuff and they'd test you
3517340	3520340	there was no time to read anything else
3520340	3522340	to study anything else that interested you
3522340	3524340	it was completely on their own track
3524340	3527340	so I went to see the professor of history of science
3527340	3529340	who was in charge of me and I said
3529340	3531340	look, I love being here at Harvard
3531340	3533340	and I'm really interested in these subjects
3533340	3536340	this isn't the way I learn and this isn't the way I work
3536340	3539340	I don't really need a master's degree from Harvard
3539340	3542340	because I can buy one from Cambridge for 75 pounds
3542340	3548340	and in those days
3548340	3552340	all you had to do was stay alive for three and a third years
3552340	3555340	and pay five pounds and you've got a master's degree
3555340	3557340	if you've got a bachelor's, same as Oxford
3557340	3558340	same as Oxford, yes
3558340	3560340	so presumably you bought yours too
3560340	3561340	or maybe you didn't bother
3561340	3563340	yes, it came to me automatically
3563340	3564340	I don't think I had to pay
3564340	3566340	oh yes, I had to pay five pounds
3566340	3568340	so I said to the professor
3568340	3570340	I just don't need your master's degree
3571340	3573340	and he said are you sure
3573340	3575340	and he said there's a Harvard master's degree
3575340	3576340	and I said well I'm quite sure
3576340	3578340	I'll get a Cambridge one
3578340	3580340	and I said is there any way out
3580340	3582340	and just be here for a year
3582340	3584340	and be part of the university
3584340	3586340	and not do all these exams
3586340	3588340	and tests and things
3588340	3590340	I said I think that would be much more useful
3590340	3592340	and valuable for me
3592340	3594340	he said well actually we do have a rarely used
3594340	3596340	provision called special students
3596340	3598340	and he said
3598340	3600340	and I said well can you make me one
3600340	3602340	and he said well I'd have to talk to
3602340	3603340	the committee and stuff
3603340	3604340	so anyway
3604340	3606340	I got him to register
3606340	3607340	they agreed
3607340	3609340	and I was registered as a special student
3609340	3611340	so I was there in the graduate school at Harvard
3611340	3613340	I was doing a bit of teaching
3613340	3615340	to earn a bit of money in the natural sciences program
3615340	3617340	in biology labs
3617340	3619340	in biology 101
3619340	3621340	I was teaching lab classes
3621340	3624340	but otherwise, apart from my obligation to do that
3624340	3626340	I had complete freedom
3626340	3628340	I went to lectures in history of art
3628340	3629340	and philosophy
3629340	3631340	and classics
3631340	3633340	in history
3633340	3635340	I had the entire
3635340	3637340	I got the university catalogue
3637340	3639340	and I went through the list of lectures every week
3639340	3641340	and I did a lot of philosophy
3641340	3643340	in history of science
3643340	3645340	but I had an entire university
3645340	3647340	at my disposal
3647340	3649340	and whenever I was doing exams
3649340	3651340	I just caught the train to New York
3651340	3653340	and had fun in New York
3653340	3655340	for a few days
3655340	3657340	and it was the most blissful way of being at a university
3657340	3659340	and then later
3659340	3661340	when I got my fellowship at Clare College
3661340	3663340	in Cambridge
3663340	3665340	it started as a research fellowship
3665340	3667340	and it was
3667340	3669340	I had a six year research fellowship
3669340	3671340	where
3671340	3673340	my teaching load was limited
3673340	3675340	to six hours a week of
3675340	3677340	tutorials and since
3677340	3679340	in Cambridge, like Oxford, the vacations
3679340	3681340	last six and a half months a year
3681340	3683340	this is only six hours a week
3683340	3685340	for five and a half months a year
3685340	3687340	and actually less than that
3687340	3689340	because half a month is exams
3689340	3691340	it was not exactly an onerous teaching burden
3691340	3693340	it was the nicest form of teaching
3693340	3695340	to students at a time
3695340	3697340	informally in tutorials
3697340	3699340	and the rest of the time
3699340	3701340	I was completely free
3701340	3703340	I don't think I even read annual reports
3703340	3705340	then I got a research fellowship
3705340	3707340	from the Ross site
3707340	3709340	and I did have to write a one page annual report
3709340	3711340	but I was completely free
3711340	3713340	and quite into it
3713340	3715340	when I said to the college
3715340	3717340	I just got this
3717340	3719340	thing from the Ross site
3719340	3721340	a tropical research grant
3721340	3723340	and I'm going off to the University of Malaya
3723340	3725340	for a year to study rainforest plants
3725340	3727340	and travelling through India on the way
3727340	3729340	they said
3729340	3731340	well fine
3731340	3733340	it was an incredible
3733340	3735340	period for me
3735340	3737340	laid the foundation for everything I've done since
3737340	3739340	so like you
3739340	3741340	given an extraordinary freedom
3741340	3743340	within an institutional framework
3743340	3745340	which was
3745340	3747340	vastly valuable
3747340	3749340	now very very few people have that opportunity
3749340	3751340	absolutely
3751340	3753340	and you know what I want to emphasise
3753340	3755340	is I
3755340	3757340	like you I think it's very important
3757340	3759340	like you I feel very grateful for having been given it
3759340	3761340	my worry is that it won't be
3761340	3763340	given in the future to many people
3763340	3765340	but I think it's important
3765340	3767340	we live in an era
3767340	3769340	of micro-management
3769340	3771340	and I think micro-management produces only mediocrity
3771340	3773340	if you're constantly controlling
3773340	3775340	and dictating what people
3775340	3777340	read and think you'll only get
3777340	3779340	mediocrity
3779340	3781340	and if you give people a degree of freedom
3781340	3783340	okay there's a risk that they will abuse it
3783340	3785340	and they won't come up with something
3785340	3787340	but it's a much smaller risk
3787340	3789340	than the risk of micro-managing them
3789340	3791340	which ensures that they will never come up with anything interesting
3791340	3793340	so you actually have to
3793340	3795340	in a way trust
3795340	3797340	you have time to people
3797340	3799340	to explore things
3799340	3801340	that are of interest to them
3801340	3803340	otherwise it's the death of the life of the mind
3803340	3805340	it's for this reason that so many
3805340	3807340	as we both know
3807340	3809340	in the past so much of the science of the 18th
3809340	3811340	and 19th century
3811340	3813340	and even into the 20th century
3813340	3815340	comes from the work
3815340	3817340	of priests
3817340	3819340	of vickers of monks
3819340	3821340	I mean Mendel was a monk
3821340	3823340	they weren't part of any particular mainstream
3823340	3825340	but they had the security of a place
3825340	3827340	and they were allowed to think
3827340	3829340	and observe and ask
3829340	3831340	interesting questions why do people
3831340	3833340	work in this way
3833340	3835340	well I think one simple way
3835340	3837340	this could be achieved at the strike of a pen
3837340	3839340	is simply changing
3839340	3841340	the name of unemployment benefit
3841340	3843340	to research grants
3849340	3851340	so then we could have lots
3851340	3853340	of people on research grants
3853340	3855340	and the stigma of being on unemployment
3855340	3857340	would be transformed
3857340	3859340	at least for some people
3859340	3861340	yes very nice
3861340	3863340	because we after all have a lot of people
3863340	3865340	who are economically idle
3865340	3867340	as in we're in the classification of governments
3867340	3869340	who are actually being paid
3869340	3871340	by the state
3871340	3873340	and so much of that
3873340	3875340	could be repurposed
3875340	3877340	I mean mostly people are disempowered
3877340	3879340	by being unemployed
3879340	3881340	if this could be seen as a
3881340	3883340	positive thing
3883340	3885340	and also
3885340	3887340	another idea
3887340	3889340	it's only academics really that have sabbatical years
3889340	3891340	which is supposed to be
3891340	3893340	a year in which you can enjoy
3893340	3895340	the kind of freedom we're talking about
3895340	3897340	to be refreshed and so on
3897340	3899340	and
3899340	3901340	so
3901340	3903340	another scheme would be to make
3903340	3905340	sabbatical years optional for everybody
3905340	3907340	so when you're at 40
3907340	3909340	or 50 or 60
3909340	3911340	you could take an optional sabbatical year
3911340	3913340	and you'd take a cut
3913340	3915340	in income, you'd take leave from your regular job
3915340	3917340	and you'd get the unemployment
3917340	3919340	benefit which would now be
3919340	3921340	a redesignated research grant
3921340	3923340	or a sabbatical grant
3923340	3925340	it wouldn't cost the state anymore
3925340	3927340	because they're paying lots of people
3927340	3929340	not to work anyway
3929340	3931340	and by empowering people
3931340	3933340	who are not working in regular jobs
3933340	3935340	to think of themselves as doing
3935340	3937340	something different
3937340	3939340	it could be voluntary work
3939340	3941340	it could be natural history
3941340	3943340	it could be scientific research
3943340	3945340	there could be small grants
3945340	3947340	for people on sabbaticals
3947340	3949340	to set up experiments in their garages
3949340	3951340	and stuff
3951340	3953340	it could fuel a whole wealth of invention
3953340	3955340	throughout the population
3955340	3957340	I'm sure you were right
3957340	3959340	almost no extra cost
3959340	3961340	and one thing I
3961340	3963340	know from experiences
3963340	3965340	a practical skill
3965340	3967340	that it has been enormously satisfying
3967340	3969340	probably more satisfying than almost anything else
3971340	3973340	and so
3973340	3975340	encouraging people not just to feel
3975340	3977340	demoralized and not have any goal
3977340	3979340	it might be better to allow people
3979340	3981340	to train
3981340	3983340	to develop a skill
3983340	3985340	which is a very life enhancing thing
3985340	3987340	and useful to society
3987340	3989340	there's not enough skilled labour
3989340	3991340	ones always looking for people who can do
3991340	3993340	this or that or the other
3993340	3995340	and maybe that should be part
3995340	3997340	of the scheme as well
3997340	3999340	there's already government schemes
3999340	4001340	for people in deprived areas
4001340	4003340	economically
4003340	4005340	for retraining
4005340	4007340	there's already retraining grants
4007340	4009340	I haven't looked into how they're administered
4009340	4011340	but I imagine that
4011340	4013340	if one got into the details
4013340	4015340	of existing bureaucracy
4015340	4017340	and existing grant structures
4017340	4019340	some of it could be repurposed
4019340	4021340	in a way that's
4021340	4023340	along the lines you're suggesting
4023340	4025340	some of it's intended for that
4027340	4029340	so I think within the present system
4029340	4031340	there's probably quite a lot of potential
4031340	4033340	for revisioning
4033340	4035340	what people can learn and do
4035340	4037340	so drawing things together
4037340	4039340	perhaps there's a need
4041340	4043340	to break out of the straight jacket
4043340	4045340	of these people are unemployed
4045340	4047340	and therefore just waiting to get back into
4047340	4049340	this horrible machine
4049340	4051340	there's life outside the machine
4051340	4053340	there are other things that can be developed
4053340	4055340	for all of us depending on
4055340	4057340	what is both practical
4057340	4059340	for us and enjoyable
4059340	4061340	for us to develop
4061340	4063340	and it's about
4063340	4065340	abandoning this
4065340	4067340	micromanaging
4067340	4069340	administrative approach
4069340	4071340	to education
4071340	4073340	to science
4073340	4075340	and allowing people to develop the skills
4075340	4077340	that they have innately
4077340	4079340	in other words education should be a matter
4079340	4081340	of growing things
4081340	4083340	not inserting things
4083340	4085340	and at the moment it's mainly about inserting things
4085340	4087340	but it's interesting
4087340	4089340	one of the things that's happening at the moment
4089340	4091340	is the so called skill shortage
4091340	4093340	or employment shortage
4093340	4095340	I read an article
4095340	4097340	just yesterday
4097340	4099340	the mystery of why
4099340	4101340	we have very low
4101340	4103340	unemployment at the moment
4103340	4105340	in Britain
4105340	4107340	and yet you can't get people to do jobs
4107340	4109340	but there's
4109340	4111340	large numbers of people who are economically inactive
4111340	4113340	and so
4113340	4115340	most people in Britain assume
4115340	4117340	the skills shortage or labour shortage
4117340	4119340	is because of Brexit
4119340	4121340	no
4121340	4123340	immigration from Europe
4123340	4125340	but
4125340	4127340	those are very similar when we were in Canada in the summer
4127340	4129340	they have the same situation there
4129340	4131340	in western Canada it's the same in the United States
4131340	4133340	what seems to have happened
4133340	4135340	is that a large number of people
4135340	4137340	have just voluntarily retired
4137340	4139340	from the labour force
4139340	4141340	before retirement age
4141340	4143340	simply can't be bothered to have a job
4143340	4145340	and that must mean a drop in income
4145340	4147340	but there's millions of people
4147340	4149340	prepared to take that rather than carry on
4149340	4151340	well what that tells you is
4151340	4153340	that a lot of people's jobs are very unrewarding
4153340	4155340	and I think
4155340	4157340	what's really sad is that
4157340	4159340	jobs that are in the past
4159340	4161340	are obviously rewarding
4161340	4163340	like being a teacher or a doctor
4163340	4165340	I think people are probably
4165340	4167340	not keen to, we know there's a shortage of doctors
4167340	4169340	there's a shortage of teachers
4169340	4171340	and I think that's partly to do with
4171340	4173340	the way again a management culture
4173340	4175340	has taken over
4175340	4177340	from a professional culture
4177340	4179340	and the individual is no longer
4179340	4181340	allowed to pursue interests
4181340	4183340	and it's entirely
4183340	4185340	micromanaged like the Harvard thing
4185340	4187340	today you read these things
4187340	4189340	or you read those
4189340	4191340	so we need to stop this
4191340	4193340	and there was a wonderful moment
4193340	4195340	of creativity early on
4195340	4197340	in the Covid crisis
4197340	4199340	when managers couldn't keep up with the situation
4199340	4201340	and doctors said well
4201340	4203340	the hell with it we're going to do what we think will work
4203340	4205340	and lots of things were experimented with
4205340	4207340	and some of them were successful and some of them not
4207340	4209340	but this is a good situation
4209340	4211340	there's one in which doctors use their experience
4211340	4213340	are not told what to do
4213340	4215340	by a manager who has no experience
4215340	4217340	and in closing
4217340	4219340	it's not only important
4219340	4221340	we talk about it but again let me say
4221340	4223340	both of you are examples that this can be done
4223340	4225340	so I think it's useful
4225340	4227340	again to have the discussion
4227340	4229340	but to show that there are living examples
4229340	4231340	and it's not easy
4231340	4233340	but it can be done
4233340	4235340	and hopefully more people in the future
4235340	4237340	will be able to
4237340	4239340	we've been very fortunate
4239340	4241340	yes very fortunate
4241340	4243340	both within and outside
4243340	4245340	institutions
4245340	4247340	all right
4247340	4249340	thank you very much
4249340	4251340	well thank you Alex
