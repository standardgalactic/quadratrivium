00:00.000 --> 00:20.240
Well, Alex and I are about to talk about a book that I wrote over about the last 10 years called

00:20.240 --> 00:25.360
The Matter With Things, subtitled Our Brains, Our Delusions and The Unmaking of the World.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.720
I was very fortunate that Alex approached me to talk some more about this. We don't know how many

00:32.720 --> 00:37.840
sessions we will do, but we thought we'd start at any rate at the beginning of the book and discuss

00:37.840 --> 00:45.600
that and see where we go. Alex is a remarkable person. I'm personally in awe of his curriculum

00:45.600 --> 00:52.880
vitae. He is a theoretical physicist by training and has a couple of doctorates in physics,

00:52.880 --> 01:03.600
but he then retrained as a biologist and has worked on molecular biology and empirical zoology,

01:03.600 --> 01:13.120
but also on the theory of the theoretical aspects of biology and is currently a professor at the

01:13.120 --> 01:23.680
Institute of Neurosciences in Alicante. He is a person with a remarkable breadth of interest

01:23.680 --> 01:32.640
and mind. This is very nice for me because I find that I don't easily fit into any particular box.

01:34.320 --> 01:40.400
I'm generally interested in philosophy and have been since my younger years. I started out training

01:40.400 --> 01:47.920
in literature and humanities and then read medicine and became a psychiatrist with particular

01:47.920 --> 01:56.720
interest in the overlapping areas of psychology and neurology. We need to see what happens and

01:56.720 --> 02:03.280
I'm very excited about it. Well, thank you again. It's a pleasure, really, and an honor to take

02:03.280 --> 02:09.440
part in this journey with you and to continue learning from you and with you as we cover your

02:10.000 --> 02:14.720
really, really remarkable book. Thank you. Well, thank you very much.

02:16.880 --> 02:23.200
Before going on, I thought I might just give a brief overview of the introduction, which is

02:23.200 --> 02:28.800
something like 50 pages long, and it's that that we're going to be discussing this morning. See how

02:28.800 --> 02:39.360
that goes. This particular book, The Matter with Things, arises from something I have been

02:39.360 --> 02:46.720
thinking over all my adult life, which is that there is something wrong with the way in which we

02:46.720 --> 02:55.200
are taught by popular science and many of the voxpop thinkers that are on the internet, the way

02:55.200 --> 02:59.920
we're taught to think about the world. And it's really part also of the way in which we educate

02:59.920 --> 03:08.800
the young. That is to liken it to a machine, a mechanism that has meaning only insofar as we

03:08.800 --> 03:16.480
put it into that world. But when we come to look at the world, what we're really faced with is a

03:16.480 --> 03:26.720
collection of meaningless fragments of material stuff colliding with itself in ways that are to

03:26.720 --> 03:34.320
an extent predictable, but largely chaotic. And that this has no intrinsic beauty, complexity,

03:34.320 --> 03:40.720
structure, meaning, or direction. That has never seemed to me at all convincing.

03:41.600 --> 03:51.760
What I want to do in this book, or what I wanted to do in this book, was to explain why that vision

03:51.760 --> 03:57.760
of the world is to me not a convincing one and to offer an alternative. So in the introduction,

03:57.760 --> 04:04.960
I ask us to reconsider some of our assumptions about the world. For example, that there is only

04:04.960 --> 04:13.920
there is only matter that that matter is naturally speaking, static until it is set in motion,

04:14.960 --> 04:25.920
that things are essentially atomistic until they're connected by us, that structures are,

04:26.880 --> 04:35.760
in essence, simple, and then evolve from that simplicity into a greater complexity. And what

04:35.760 --> 04:44.560
to suggest is all these ideas are wrong, that we've inverted the evidence that we have before us.

04:44.560 --> 04:52.240
The evidence is, I will argue, that consciousness is every bit as real as matter. And that matter,

04:52.400 --> 04:59.040
in fact, is something we know secondarily by consciousness, not the other way around, that

05:00.000 --> 05:04.640
the natural condition of things is not as in the Newtonian universe out of stasis,

05:05.440 --> 05:11.360
but is of motion. And what needs to be explained is not how things come to move,

05:11.360 --> 05:16.160
but how they ever come to be static. And I indeed argue that they are never truly static.

05:16.640 --> 05:24.880
I will argue that the world is not principally chaotic, nor that structures are, in essence,

05:24.880 --> 05:31.920
simple. These are products of the way we come to look at the world. In fact, there is no such

05:31.920 --> 05:40.880
thing as chaos. Randomness cannot really be any more than approximated. Everything has intrinsic

05:41.680 --> 05:51.440
structure. And what is simple in our eyes is simple, not because it's somehow what existed

05:51.440 --> 05:57.840
before things became complex. Things have always been complex, but our way of looking at them can

05:57.840 --> 06:05.120
share off most of the picture that surrounds what we're looking at, and thus make it appear simple,

06:05.200 --> 06:13.360
and to obey simple linear laws. Whereas, in reality, nothing in the cosmos behaves in this

06:13.360 --> 06:19.520
mechanistic way. So those are some of the assumptions I set out with. And then I want to

06:20.240 --> 06:27.120
talk about the way in which the two hemispheres of the brain change the world that we look at,

06:27.120 --> 06:32.240
because obviously, if I'm interested in examining what we can take as more real,

06:32.240 --> 06:39.120
more true than anything else, we need to take into account that how we tend to the world changes

06:39.120 --> 06:45.760
what is there for us to see. In an earlier book called The Master and His Emissary,

06:45.760 --> 06:52.720
I explained that the two hemispheres of the brain have evolved as all neural networks that we know

06:52.720 --> 07:01.920
are going back 700 million years show an asymmetry. Why is there this asymmetry? It appears to be to

07:02.640 --> 07:09.840
with the most basic problems of survival for any living creature. And that is how to pay attention

07:09.840 --> 07:19.040
to an isolated detail, something that is a mortal that we want to eat, prey that we want to catch,

07:19.040 --> 07:24.560
a twig that we want to pick up to build a nest, anything that we want to grab and get and manipulate,

07:25.200 --> 07:33.200
which requires a highly focused, targeted attention to a precisely visualized detail.

07:34.320 --> 07:41.920
And at the same time, not for prey ourselves to predators that are in our surroundings.

07:41.920 --> 07:49.680
So at the same time as paying this very focused, detailed attention to one particular item,

07:50.480 --> 07:56.560
we need to be paying the exact opposite, a kind of broad, open, sustained, vigilant attention

07:56.560 --> 08:03.680
in which we can see what is unfolding around us. We can see dangers, we can see the presence of

08:03.680 --> 08:08.480
the creatures that form part of our social network, those that we want to nourish,

08:08.480 --> 08:14.560
those that we need to flee from. So that is a very, very essential aspect of being alive.

08:15.280 --> 08:22.400
And in the human case, it is eventuated in the two hemispheres of the brain, which are

08:24.080 --> 08:29.120
different in a number of respects, but all of these can be traced to the way in which they

08:29.120 --> 08:35.520
pay attention. If, as in the case of the left hemisphere, you pay this very narrow,

08:35.520 --> 08:41.600
beam, highly focused, targeted attention to detail, then the world appears to be

08:41.600 --> 08:47.440
created out of a heap of fragments, little pieces here, there, and everywhere that are

08:47.440 --> 08:53.440
isolated atomistic in themselves, meaningless, sheared off from any context that might give

08:53.440 --> 08:58.880
the meaning static, because this is the attention that fixes and freezes things so that you can

08:58.880 --> 09:08.400
get hold of them, and essentially inanimate. Whereas the right hemisphere, seeing continuity

09:08.400 --> 09:15.440
over time and continuity over space, sees a world in which everything is interconnected seamlessly,

09:16.160 --> 09:22.720
in which things are never fixed but constantly changing and flowing, in which context is vital

09:22.720 --> 09:27.920
importance to understanding what it is that we're looking at, in which everything is charged with

09:27.920 --> 09:35.120
many layers of meaning, and which is essentially an animate world. One way of looking at this

09:35.120 --> 09:41.440
difference is that the left hemisphere sees something like a very simplified diagram that

09:41.440 --> 09:47.280
we create after the event of experience. So the right hemisphere, as it were, experiencing the

09:47.280 --> 09:55.440
world, it is bringing the thing into being for us, and the left hemisphere is representing,

09:55.440 --> 10:00.880
in other words, literally after the fact of it's being present, is making it present again,

10:00.880 --> 10:06.400
when it no longer truly is present, in the shape of a theory, a diagram, a schema, or a map.

10:07.040 --> 10:14.400
And this difference between the world in theory and as it is mapped by the left hemisphere, which

10:14.400 --> 10:21.120
sees everything in mechanical terms, is quite different from the living vibrant world that

10:21.120 --> 10:26.640
the right hemisphere sees without making presumptions about its mechanical nature.

10:27.200 --> 10:33.920
Because I'm suggesting that attention changes the world, I need to clarify that I don't mean

10:33.920 --> 10:42.720
that we make up the world in a purely idealist way, that there is no real world at all, but it's

10:42.720 --> 10:50.880
just what the product of our mind produces. I'm not saying that, but I'm also not saying that there

10:51.840 --> 11:01.360
is just simply, naively, a world out there that is purely objective and has nothing of us in it,

11:01.360 --> 11:07.680
and that the way to understand it is to exclude our attention entirely from the process. That will

11:07.680 --> 11:12.240
produce certainly a version of the world, but a very remarkable one in which everything that

11:12.320 --> 11:21.760
makes it valuable to us has been taken out of the picture. Then I give some of the core ideas of

11:22.400 --> 11:30.240
the hemisphere hypothesis, as I have developed it, some 20 perhaps differences that one can see

11:30.240 --> 11:35.120
between the ways in which the right and left hemisphere deliver the world, the nature of

11:35.120 --> 11:40.880
those differences, and they address some of the potential causes of confusion. So over the last

11:40.880 --> 11:46.800
decade or so people have raised perfectly valid questions about what it is I'm saying, but which

11:46.800 --> 11:56.080
are misunderstandings of what I'm trying to convey, and so I address some of those. I also

11:56.080 --> 12:01.840
address the question of should we go beyond the facts. This is something that scientists sometimes

12:01.840 --> 12:07.360
say when one looks at scientific findings in a philosophical way, as though they had

12:08.160 --> 12:15.360
as though they had significance for us as human beings. There is no way they cannot have

12:15.360 --> 12:24.400
significance for us, and most great scientists have also seen that what we find in empirical

12:24.400 --> 12:31.680
science helps us shape the picture of the world. And what I want to do is to reintroduce philosophy

12:31.680 --> 12:38.000
to science and science to philosophy. They're natural companions. In fact, until probably 200

12:38.000 --> 12:44.080
years ago they would have been thought of as aspects of the same business of coming to understand

12:44.080 --> 12:52.480
what there is in the world. And I think that I can offer a way in which we can make progress in

12:52.480 --> 13:00.400
philosophy, because in following the argument that I lay out both in the master and his emissary

13:00.400 --> 13:09.360
and in the matter with things in more detail in the more recent book, one can see what the hallmarks,

13:09.360 --> 13:15.680
the characteristics are of the way in which the world seems to the left hemisphere and the way

13:15.680 --> 13:24.720
in which the world seems to the right hemisphere. And if it's possible to evaluate how reliable

13:25.280 --> 13:32.880
either of these visions is, we can then, for the first time, make some progress in philosophy.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.640
If there are two conflicting points of view, we don't just have to shrug our shoulders and say,

13:36.640 --> 13:42.880
well, some people say this, and some people have said that. We can say, yes, this particular vision

13:42.880 --> 13:49.760
is typical of what happens when the left hemisphere gets hold of the world and tries to make sense of

13:49.760 --> 13:55.120
it. And this other picture is an attempt to convey what the right hemisphere sees there.

13:55.120 --> 14:02.320
Now, if, and that's of course a big if, which we will have to explore, if we can show that one of

14:02.320 --> 14:07.680
these visions, and spoiler alert, I'm going to suggest that this is the vision of the right

14:07.680 --> 14:15.520
hemisphere, sees more of what there is, and is a more reliable witness for us to base our activities

14:15.520 --> 14:22.160
in the world, our experience of the world, our reaction to the world on, then we can make that

14:22.160 --> 14:29.440
step and identify where certain trains of thought are to be attributed to the right or the left

14:29.440 --> 14:37.520
hemisphere. And I think that's probably enough to say here, except perhaps to give a brief note

14:37.520 --> 14:43.760
about the structure of the book. So it's in three parts, although physically in two volumes. The

14:43.760 --> 14:51.600
first part of the book is neuropsychology, in which I aim to look at the ways in which we can get a

14:51.600 --> 14:59.440
hold on the world at all, the means or portals whereby the world comes to be experienced by us.

14:59.440 --> 15:06.480
And I take those to be things like attention, perception, which is not the same as attention,

15:07.440 --> 15:14.240
judgments formed on what we tend to and how we perceive it, the ways in which we grab hold of

15:14.240 --> 15:21.680
things and use them in the world, our emotional and social intelligence, our cognitive intelligence,

15:21.680 --> 15:28.640
and indeed our creativity, all these help to bring about the basic view of the world that we have to

15:28.640 --> 15:34.720
operate on. The second part of the book, as I've mentioned, is epistemology. I look at what are

15:34.720 --> 15:42.880
the ways open to us to take further the data that we have through those portals or means that I've

15:42.880 --> 15:50.560
just described. One of them is science. We can, in the practice of science, we can use our senses and

15:50.560 --> 15:58.320
our various intellectual and imaginative faculties to create a picture of the world that helps us

15:58.320 --> 16:06.000
understand it. Another would obviously be reason. A third, I suggest, would be intuition and a

16:06.000 --> 16:11.920
fourth, imagination. And I look at each of those in part two of the book and suggest that, in fact,

16:11.920 --> 16:18.160
we cannot dispense with any of these, but need to bring them to bear in different ratios and in

16:18.160 --> 16:24.800
different ways on everything that we come to look at. And that's interesting in each case,

16:24.800 --> 16:33.120
the view of the right hemisphere is the one that gives most power to each of those paths to truth,

16:34.720 --> 16:39.440
toward truth, because of course we can't ever actually reach that truth in itself.

16:40.400 --> 16:46.000
And that takes me to part three, which is the second physical volume of the book,

16:46.000 --> 16:53.280
which is metaphysics. When we apply what we found in parts one and two to the universe,

16:53.280 --> 16:59.360
what do we find? And this involves looking at the basic elements of the cosmos, things like

16:59.360 --> 17:06.400
time and space, matter and consciousness, but also things such as values and the sense of the sacred.

17:07.040 --> 17:14.480
So that is the outline of the book and it's that that I try to convey in this introductory part

17:14.480 --> 17:19.840
of the book. So Alex, that's probably as much as I need to say at the moment, probably more than

17:19.840 --> 17:27.920
enough. And I'd like to hand over to you now, because I'm sure you've got comments and questions.

17:27.920 --> 17:32.640
Sure. I mean, that's fantastic. And one can see there's so much to unpack. And that's

17:33.360 --> 17:38.640
the reason why we're doing this, actually, to have this conversation. So yours is obviously

17:38.640 --> 17:44.080
an ambitious task. And it's an important task. And you argue that it's also an urgent task.

17:44.080 --> 17:49.840
And as you also mentioned a minute ago, and there are all these isms, right, materialism,

17:49.840 --> 17:54.720
reductionism, representationalism, or there are all these connection of isms that in a way,

17:55.440 --> 18:00.720
well, you're fighting against or even better, you're trying, as you said, to invert or correct

18:01.280 --> 18:06.480
kind of the hierarchy or the superiority they have on other ways of understanding the world.

18:06.480 --> 18:10.560
Now, a distinction that you make that I think it's really, really powerful. And that's what I

18:10.560 --> 18:17.440
would like to discuss now for a little for a little time is this distinction between apprehending

18:17.440 --> 18:23.680
and comprehending as as illustrating this radically different views of seeing the world.

18:23.680 --> 18:29.040
And one has to do with manipulation, of course, and the other one with understanding. And I think

18:29.040 --> 18:34.080
just from the words themselves and the roots of the works, it is very powerful both as a summary

18:34.080 --> 18:41.680
and also as a as a root of the of the cause of all these preference for certain isms that you're

18:41.680 --> 18:47.600
saying pop thinkers present as if they were true, actually, which are, in my view, abstractions.

18:47.600 --> 18:55.840
And to confront these with experience, and also a avoiding the common distrust we have

18:55.840 --> 18:59.760
on experience. But I wanted to ask you about experience later, but maybe we could continue

18:59.760 --> 19:03.520
with apprehending and comprehending, because it's very useful to me.

19:04.960 --> 19:11.600
Yes, thank you for drawing attention to that. I use the word apprehend in a specific sense,

19:11.600 --> 19:17.360
which is its original sense of grasping hold of something. And this comes from the Latin root

19:17.920 --> 19:26.240
add and prehendery, prehendery, to take hold and add to go to it and take it. And this is

19:27.200 --> 19:32.960
the function I suggest from an evolutionary point of view of the left hemisphere to enables

19:32.960 --> 19:42.720
us to manipulate the world. The right hemisphere, I suggest comprehends helps us understand the

19:42.720 --> 19:47.920
world. And that comes from a root and Latin meaning to take together. And that's really an

19:47.920 --> 19:56.880
important point, because an awful lot of what I'm talking about is what follows from whether you

19:56.880 --> 20:05.280
see things as a whole, and only move to focus on a part, taking into account that you're looking

20:05.280 --> 20:11.280
in an artificial way as part of a whole. And the other way of looking at it, which is you try and

20:11.280 --> 20:16.240
break it down into the smallest parts, you can understand those and then build it back up from

20:16.240 --> 20:22.560
there. That is, of course, how we make a machine. And so it's the obvious way in which the part of

20:22.560 --> 20:28.320
the mind that grasps things and takes them apart wants to view the cosmos itself, which it didn't

20:28.320 --> 20:35.360
actually make, but imagines it is something like a machine that we could have constructed.

20:35.360 --> 20:40.000
So that's an effective difference. And as I say, a sort of sound bike would be the left hemisphere

20:40.000 --> 20:45.280
helps us apprehend or grasp and manipulate the world. The right helps us comprehend or

20:45.280 --> 20:51.920
understand it. And that distinction, as I say, is an ancient one going back at least 700 million

20:51.920 --> 20:59.040
years, and explains the otherwise baffling fact that the brain, a structure that is made to make

20:59.040 --> 21:05.120
connections, and this power exists only in the number of connections it can make, has an enormous

21:05.120 --> 21:11.120
divide down the middle. It's also asymmetrical. Why? And the band of tissues at the base of the brain,

21:11.120 --> 21:16.320
the corpus callosum that connects those two aspects is often inhibitory. A lot of the work

21:16.320 --> 21:21.520
it does is to tell the other hemisphere, keep out of this while I deal with it. That suggests that

21:21.520 --> 21:26.640
there are two potent ways of viewing the world that mustn't interfere with one another if they're

21:26.640 --> 21:33.040
each of them to work well to the end that they're designed to fulfill. All right, I'll come back to

21:33.040 --> 21:38.400
apprehending and comprehending later. But since you, let's jump into the bihemispheric structure

21:38.480 --> 21:46.800
of the brain, because that's also the soil on which all these ideas will grow. And so we have

21:46.800 --> 21:53.200
these neurological facts that you've studied and put together in a remarkable way, because that

21:53.200 --> 22:00.000
seems to be sometimes far beyond what one person alone can hold in their mind. But there are these

22:00.000 --> 22:06.800
neurological facts that we will of course unpack. But then from here, you draw psychological

22:06.800 --> 22:12.080
implications. And as you said, even later, also metaphysical consequences, not just from the

22:12.080 --> 22:18.000
neurology, but also from physics and from philosophy itself. So maybe we could discuss a bit now,

22:18.000 --> 22:24.320
or as much as needed, what are these neurological facts and probably advancing one of the usual

22:24.320 --> 22:31.280
criticisms of the split brain hypothesis and what it means, which is that, well, fine, sure,

22:31.760 --> 22:36.320
you know, there's split and there are all these inhibitory connections and so on. But

22:37.840 --> 22:43.680
people may not be so comfortable saying more than that, as you were saying at the beginning,

22:43.680 --> 22:50.000
like, drawing real-world consequences of what's purely, in a way, neuroscientific data. But let's

22:50.000 --> 22:55.200
not say that there are two brains and two minds and two ways, because that seems hand-waving. I

22:55.200 --> 23:00.960
think it's not at all. And probably that's a foundational stone of your whole argument. I

23:00.960 --> 23:06.240
think it would be very useful for everybody to realize and for us to explain, for you to explain

23:06.240 --> 23:14.480
us that, yes, there has been some pop psychological understanding of it, and you're not saying that.

23:14.480 --> 23:19.040
You're saying something more precise and more potent in a way. So it's a good time, perhaps,

23:19.040 --> 23:25.920
for you to explain that, if you may. Yes, that's a good idea.

23:28.880 --> 23:35.040
I think it's not passed into popular culture that the idea of differences between the brain

23:35.040 --> 23:42.880
hemispheres is somehow an exploded idea that carries no scientific credibility. And that's

23:42.880 --> 23:50.480
because after the first brain operations were carried out in the 1960s and 70s in California,

23:51.760 --> 24:04.080
the remarkable operations, we were able to study the phenomenology of one isolated hemisphere at a

24:04.080 --> 24:10.240
time and see what it is like. And it was discovered that, indeed, the phenomenology of the left hemisphere

24:10.240 --> 24:16.800
and the right hemisphere are, in fact, very different. The fact that we're not aware of that is

24:16.800 --> 24:23.280
because evolution has taken care to hide it from us if we were aware that we're kind of fusing two

24:23.280 --> 24:27.760
quite different visions of the world all the time. We wouldn't be able to do anything. We would be

24:27.760 --> 24:36.400
completely incapable of action. But the fact that there was some very simple minded deduction

24:36.400 --> 24:42.880
that's made in the early days, such as that the left hemisphere is linguistic and rational,

24:42.880 --> 24:49.760
and the right hemisphere emotional and artistic, they may have vestiges of truth in them, but only

24:49.760 --> 24:56.080
vestiges, because the picture is very much more complex than that. And each hemisphere, in fact,

24:56.080 --> 25:04.960
deals with everything, including reason and emotion, and including creativity and reason.

25:04.960 --> 25:12.800
So the old differences are to be dispensed with. And I think one of the first things I would say to

25:12.800 --> 25:17.360
anybody is, put out of your mind everything you think you know about the differences between

25:17.360 --> 25:25.680
the left and right hemispheres because they will be wrong. So it is an important distinction to

25:25.680 --> 25:31.840
make, and I'm not just following up the old vision, but the question won't go away.

25:31.840 --> 25:38.160
There is, at the core of our being, this fascinating division in the brain, and therefore

25:38.160 --> 25:47.680
inevitably in the mental world. Why is it there? And what is its nature? And I unpack those ideas

25:48.240 --> 25:55.920
in the whatever it is, nine chapters, I think, of part one, and we'll probably look at those in

25:55.920 --> 26:04.160
greater detail on another occasion. Yeah. So here, let me add a kind of a food note

26:04.800 --> 26:11.600
referring to your biography in a way, because I think it's remarkable that what you're putting

26:11.600 --> 26:17.920
forth is it is a brave endeavor in the sense that you're walking a fine line, right? Because you're

26:17.920 --> 26:23.440
emphasizing how the structure of the brain shapes this way of attending the world that we have as

26:23.440 --> 26:28.480
individuals, and as a society, and as a culture, and as a civilization, right? But at the same time,

26:28.480 --> 26:33.920
you have to be very careful, and you lay it out in the introduction where you explain first the

26:33.920 --> 26:39.040
kind of headline differences between the hemispheres, and then the common confusions, because

26:39.600 --> 26:43.440
since the publication of the master and his imagery, you've had time to see

26:44.080 --> 26:48.240
what people think and what they criticize, right? So you need to walk this fine line by saying, well,

26:48.800 --> 26:54.480
yes, I'm drawing a lot of neural data, but I am not saying that mind is just a derivative of

26:54.480 --> 27:02.560
brain stuff, and so on and so forth, right? And this is also related to your path as a scholar,

27:02.560 --> 27:09.040
right? Where you wanted to study this, which seems this hemisphere difference, which maybe

27:09.040 --> 27:14.800
seemed like a worn out idea, but it was actually underexplored. So you were advised not to do so,

27:14.880 --> 27:19.840
as I understand. Nevertheless, you went for it, right? So you see how interesting, I mean,

27:19.840 --> 27:24.480
just again, it's a food note, because we'll go back to the content again. But I think,

27:24.480 --> 27:29.440
as you ever say, context is being something very important. I want to draw attention to the fact of

27:29.440 --> 27:35.680
the context as you, of you as a scholar, while approaching these ideas, because that's important

27:35.680 --> 27:41.120
in the wider picture of things. There are these ideas that either are pushed to the side,

27:41.120 --> 27:46.240
and if you want to go and study them, you're usually advised not to do so, because that's not

27:46.240 --> 27:52.000
career building, but it's in doing that, that one can make progress. So if you don't mind to

27:52.640 --> 28:00.000
tell us a bit more about that path of yours, and we can quickly go back to the content of the book,

28:00.000 --> 28:08.880
if you wish. Yeah, as I mentioned, I, for my life, really, I've been interested in philosophical

28:08.880 --> 28:18.400
questions. And in philosophy, one is looking at the structure of ideas, putting them in

28:19.120 --> 28:24.720
contrast with one another, in connection with one another. And this is in some ways, the opposite

28:24.720 --> 28:33.120
of what people often think the process of science should be, which is taking things apart, and looking

28:33.200 --> 28:42.160
at them as separate discrete facts or data points. And this is so strong that we've lost really the

28:42.160 --> 28:48.320
whole purpose of science, which in the end, yes, you have to do a lot of analysis, a lot of taking

28:48.320 --> 28:53.520
things apart. But the purpose of doing so is not fulfilled just in doing that process. That's an

28:53.520 --> 28:59.600
intermediary step. The whole point of doing that is to be able to use that information to enrich

28:59.600 --> 29:05.680
one's understanding and one's picture of the whole. And in fact, I start from a point made by

29:05.680 --> 29:11.600
Erwin Schrodinger in the years just after the Second World War, when he was lecturing in Cambridge,

29:11.600 --> 29:20.160
Schrodinger, of course, one of the great figures in the development of quantum mechanics in the last

29:20.160 --> 29:30.320
century. He said, really, the point of scientific research is only fulfilled in as much as it begins

29:30.320 --> 29:37.600
to help us understand the question, who are we? And he's actually quoting Plotinus, a Greek scholar

29:37.600 --> 29:42.880
of the third century. And what Plotinus was asking is the question that we seem to have lost sight of.

29:42.880 --> 29:49.680
And I think he's a damagingly lost sight of, we seem to have lost any idea, the remotest idea

29:49.680 --> 29:55.040
of who we are and what we're doing here. And it's in an effort to help understand that question

29:55.040 --> 30:04.160
that I wrote in this book. So it's inevitable that one tries to see the picture in a sense that makes

30:05.040 --> 30:12.400
sense as a whole and also makes sense in the context of a human life. What I found is that

30:13.200 --> 30:23.600
a lot of people who are specialists in the field of neurology have gravitated to my ideas. But

30:23.600 --> 30:31.120
those who work purely in laboratory science in the neurosciences have tended not to. And I think

30:31.920 --> 30:38.480
what we see there is that there is no way in which somebody who is a physician or a surgeon who is

30:38.480 --> 30:45.600
actually dealing with real people can ignore the blatant evidence that these two parts of the brain

30:46.640 --> 30:53.440
work in different ways and produce different kinds of experience for the individual. Whereas if you

30:53.440 --> 31:00.080
are looking at a technical detail distanced by expensive and elaborate machinery in a laboratory,

31:00.080 --> 31:04.480
you will neither be thinking in terms of where this fits into the whole picture,

31:04.480 --> 31:10.080
nor will you welcome somebody who comes along and says, actually this has human meaning. So that

31:10.080 --> 31:20.880
is the conflict I think. But I'm so convinced that there is meaning here. This was apparent to me

31:20.880 --> 31:27.440
20 or 30 years ago and was enough at that stage. I knew very much less than I do now. But I could

31:27.440 --> 31:35.520
also already see certain important connections. And it was that that led me to be audacious enough

31:35.520 --> 31:43.520
to disregard the kind and very well meant advice of my mentors and older colleagues which was to

31:43.520 --> 31:48.560
not touch this question of hemisphere difference with a barge pole because it would be career

31:48.560 --> 31:59.760
destroying. Somehow I have a perverse desire to face certain risks if they seem important and

31:59.760 --> 32:06.080
central enough. And I just want to, before I finish on this, I just want to pick up something you've

32:06.080 --> 32:13.760
said there which was that I don't suggest that the mind is purely an emanation of the brain. We'll

32:13.760 --> 32:22.480
come on to that very much later in other talks, I hope. But what at least one can say is that

32:23.200 --> 32:29.680
the way in which we think our mental world is to some extent shaped by the brain, may not be

32:29.680 --> 32:35.920
caused by the brain, but it is nonetheless formed by the brain. It has to come via the brain and

32:35.920 --> 32:41.840
that leaves impression on our senses of work. Lovely. And actually this gets back into your,

32:42.640 --> 32:53.360
again, your fine line walking between truth as something that's out there unattainable or something

32:53.360 --> 32:58.800
that doesn't exist and putting in more towards a path to truth. And you are doing the same with

32:58.800 --> 33:05.360
reality, which is what I wanted to ask you next. So you have in the introduction these

33:05.360 --> 33:13.440
acronyms for the two views of conceiving reality, reality out there, R-O-T, I don't know if in

33:13.440 --> 33:18.640
English that should be pronounced rot. And then you have the made up miraculously by ourselves,

33:18.640 --> 33:25.920
the mambo version. And of course, again, you are in the virtuous middle. And in particular,

33:25.920 --> 33:30.400
there is this quote of yours, which I would ask you to unpack, which I think can help

33:30.400 --> 33:35.120
at least me because that's something I care a lot to understand. To what extent, as you said,

33:35.200 --> 33:41.200
you're not saying the world is nothing of us, nor it just made up entirely by us.

33:41.200 --> 33:47.360
And you're right. Quote, it is true that we can see the world only partially, but we still

33:47.360 --> 33:54.720
each see the world directly. And I think this is, I think this is very important, especially,

33:54.720 --> 33:59.920
I mean, this is an important problem always, but especially today, where, as you know, there are

33:59.920 --> 34:08.880
these types of thinking, both in pop and psychology and science, but also injecting in the real people

34:08.880 --> 34:16.080
of the real world, where we're drawn and hammered that the world is just an hallucination that

34:16.080 --> 34:22.720
everything we perceive, it's kind of the matrix all the time. But it's a matrix where even if

34:22.720 --> 34:27.120
you escape from the matrix, you would still doubt that you're still in a simulation again.

34:27.120 --> 34:33.200
Now, having somebody right like you, that we see the world directly, which is something,

34:33.200 --> 34:37.440
I believe as well, I think it's a very strong claim. And sometimes can be just

34:38.560 --> 34:44.320
be there and modest in a paragraph. I think it's essential. So if you could also help us

34:44.320 --> 34:48.000
understand your position with, again, with respect to idealism, and in what sense,

34:49.200 --> 34:55.280
we have direct access to the world, which goes back to apprehending and comprehending, I think.

34:55.280 --> 35:02.080
And also you emphasize representation or representing versus the world that's presented

35:02.960 --> 35:12.160
to us without kind of a second hand dealer that hands it in. Yes. And indeed, even more

35:15.920 --> 35:23.360
more striking is if one expresses it using neologism, which has come into philosophical

35:23.360 --> 35:29.600
language from the German of Heidegger, the idea of something presencing, which is slightly

35:29.600 --> 35:35.200
different from being is present, because his present sounds passive, as though the thing just

35:35.200 --> 35:41.520
is manipulated, whereas presencing is something active. And I believe that the world actively

35:41.520 --> 35:48.880
engages with our consciousness, which is also actively engaging with it. The idea that it's all

35:48.880 --> 35:55.200
a hallucination or a projection on an internal screen is completely understandable, but I think

35:55.200 --> 36:01.040
deeply mistaken. It's completely understandable in this sense. If the left hemisphere, which only

36:01.600 --> 36:08.880
sees the representation of the world, were to try and explain what is going on, this is exactly

36:08.880 --> 36:14.720
the picture it will come up with the idea of a homunculus sitting inside the brain, watching a

36:14.720 --> 36:21.840
screen in a chamber that has no windows on the world, and that this is what we take for reality.

36:22.960 --> 36:33.120
First of all, I think it would be remarkable if this were the case if there were as much agreement

36:33.120 --> 36:40.720
between us as to what is going on in the world as there is. We mustn't emphasize, it's certainly

36:40.720 --> 36:46.000
true that we can be deceived in what we find in the world. And some people see the world in a very

36:46.000 --> 36:51.280
strange way, and this is often the case with people that we talk about as having a mental illness

36:52.160 --> 36:59.120
hallucinating. But although that is a reality, the fact is that there is an extraordinary

36:59.120 --> 37:10.400
commonality in the ways in which we find the world to be. What I try to explain is that it

37:10.400 --> 37:15.360
is something like the way in which we appreciate a work of art, and perhaps particularly helpful is

37:15.360 --> 37:24.000
a piece of music. So take the example of Mozart's G Minor Quintet. This is not something that just

37:24.000 --> 37:31.680
exists in my mind, and it's not just something that exists in Mozart's mind, but it doesn't

37:31.680 --> 37:39.680
actually exist on the page in the score either. It exists every time it is played or listened to.

37:39.760 --> 37:47.040
It comes into being again in the minds of the players and the listeners. And this gives a rather

37:47.040 --> 37:52.640
good way of understanding what I'm trying to get out, that it's neither something that we just make

37:52.640 --> 37:57.920
up for ourselves miraculously, nor is it something that is out there objectively, and there is a

37:57.920 --> 38:03.280
real G Minor Quintet of Mozart that is the ideal performance, and that's what we're trying to get

38:03.280 --> 38:09.760
at all the time, but failing to do so. Instead I would suggest that there is an encounter,

38:10.480 --> 38:16.880
and that experience is an encounter. I think this is a very, very important idea, and in an

38:16.880 --> 38:23.760
encounter there are two elements, the encounterer and the encountered, but they are joined in a way.

38:23.760 --> 38:30.080
They're not, again, atomistically separate. They, in this act of encounter, they come together to

38:30.080 --> 38:37.920
create something. So, to an extent, it's always been newly created, that quintet, but in essence

38:37.920 --> 38:44.720
it's always recognizably the same thing. We can all talk about it and have very similar

38:44.720 --> 38:50.080
thoughts about it. That's probably the quickest and simplest way which I've ever conveyed. So,

38:50.080 --> 38:58.880
what I want to emphasize is that when we see the world, it is only, indeed, an imperfect vision.

38:58.880 --> 39:04.560
That, of course, I agree with, but the difference is not that it's imperfect because it is purely

39:04.560 --> 39:10.480
a representation of something we can never know. It's only imperfect in the sense that it is partial,

39:11.680 --> 39:23.280
and I make the comparison with a wonderful Zen garden, Ryoenji, in Japan, in which there are

39:23.280 --> 39:29.760
15 rocks in this Zen garden, but from any one place in the garden, you can only see at the most

39:29.760 --> 39:35.440
14. You can never see the full picture, and our lives are like that. We see parts, but we do

39:35.440 --> 39:41.680
actually see it. What we see is not a hallucination. Yes, thank you. Well, this is very difficult to

39:44.240 --> 39:49.920
unpack in a few minutes, and I'm sure we'll go back to it many times because, well, that has to

39:49.920 --> 39:57.040
do with the process-relational view of the universe that I think you and I share, and this is very

39:57.040 --> 40:04.080
difficult but also very important to try to spell out. Wonderful. Let me go back because, as you're

40:04.080 --> 40:10.160
saying, well, and a smile came out of your face and mind, like when a neuroscientist, let's say,

40:10.800 --> 40:20.960
is trying to justify or even claim, demonstrate that the world is nothing but the kind of

40:20.960 --> 40:27.200
hallucination. In doing that, we have this sweet paradox where it's, if we can speak like that,

40:29.680 --> 40:34.880
a hemisphere of the neuroscientist, again, making a claim about the whole of reality. So this brings

40:34.960 --> 40:43.600
us back to these two modes and the asymmetry between them and, in a way, the irreversibility

40:43.600 --> 40:50.960
in the sense that it seems very difficult, if not impossible, to just, especially the left one,

40:50.960 --> 41:00.960
realizing that the right one has a different view of the world. But you're proposing here an

41:00.960 --> 41:05.920
integration. So in a way, you're writing about both hemispheres and you're giving us all this

41:05.920 --> 41:12.720
important detail and analysis. So in a way, you're using one mode, but then you always need to have

41:13.280 --> 41:20.480
the master in its proper place to go back to the title of your previous book. So in a way,

41:20.480 --> 41:26.480
the way, so I'm saying this in order to ask you, what's the way out? Because it seems to me that

41:26.480 --> 41:31.920
if you fall into one mode of thinking, you can make amazing discoveries and say a lot of things,

41:31.920 --> 41:37.120
but in a way, you're not going to get out of it alone, because that's the very nature of being

41:37.120 --> 41:43.120
in that mode of thinking and seeing the world. You cannot go from, again, the barge to the

41:43.120 --> 41:48.560
whole. You cannot go from all these isms or all these concepts you were enumerating at the beginning.

41:48.560 --> 41:55.520
So it feels like a bit of bootstrapping is needed, or like a little miracle, so that when we are

41:55.520 --> 42:01.360
trapped in it, the balance, the proper balance can come back to it. And I know you don't offer

42:02.080 --> 42:07.920
solutions, because that would be perhaps, again, a left-brain way of thinking about it,

42:07.920 --> 42:13.360
but you do offer a view that perhaps can help us see how do we get out of this

42:13.360 --> 42:18.800
hole that we are digging ourselves. And I think that's very important also for civilization,

42:19.520 --> 42:27.200
Ridlard. Well, yes, because as you know, in that earlier book, and to an extent in this book,

42:28.240 --> 42:36.880
I make a case that our current thinking is dominated by this serial analytic

42:37.920 --> 42:43.840
reductionist process, which is characteristic of the left hemisphere. And then, actually,

42:43.840 --> 42:49.520
many of the great problems that we face, including the destruction of the natural world and the

42:49.520 --> 42:56.880
destruction of our own civilization, which are both going on a pace, can be traced to this

42:56.880 --> 43:01.680
way of looking at the world, which I believe is deeply related. Of course, it's not a matter that

43:01.680 --> 43:06.880
is susceptible of proof in its nature. It's not just that I can't prove it. It's that it can't be

43:06.880 --> 43:14.800
proven. And one of the first paradoxes is that if you view everything that is in the mind as a

43:14.800 --> 43:19.360
hallucination, then, of course, your view that everything in the mind is a hallucination is

43:19.360 --> 43:25.920
also your personal hallucination. And there is no way out of this particular box. But I offer

43:26.560 --> 43:37.840
a way from experience in in two respects. One is to take the reader on a journey in part one of

43:37.840 --> 43:44.720
the book that I think for anyone who is not actually a neuropsychiatrist or a clinical

43:44.720 --> 43:52.080
neuropsychologist will be a remarkable eye opener, and even perhaps for such people. I'm looking at

43:52.160 --> 43:58.480
actually what does happen to human beings when they start to deny purely or mainly on

43:58.480 --> 44:05.520
hyponormacy or the right one here alone. And the other way in which I think I can say

44:06.960 --> 44:17.840
I offer a pragmatic way of approaching it is that we if we want to evaluate two particular

44:17.840 --> 44:22.960
points of view, one of the ways to do so would be to test it against experience.

44:22.960 --> 44:32.480
Suppose I adopt a certain theory about humanity, and I act in that way. Do I find that I'm constantly

44:32.480 --> 44:38.880
surprised, mistaken, or taken aback by the consequences of my doing so? Or do things

44:38.880 --> 44:46.560
tend to fit with that vision of the world? And this is a point that has been made in respect of

44:46.560 --> 44:54.640
the so-called pragmatist tradition in philosophy, that of C.S. Perse, John Dewey, and William

44:54.640 --> 45:03.920
James, for example, in which, and I think a very rich one, in which the ideas of philosophy are not

45:03.920 --> 45:09.920
simply thought about in a very abstract way, which would be a very left hemisphere, a biased way,

45:09.920 --> 45:18.480
but tested out on experience. And what I find is that the vision of the world that the right

45:18.480 --> 45:29.280
hemisphere offers us makes sense to us and doesn't betray us to the degree that it would be that the

45:29.280 --> 45:34.320
left hemisphere's view of the world would betray us. And one way of thinking about this is like,

45:34.320 --> 45:39.680
suppose you have a couple of banks of instruments and you're flying a plane and you

45:39.680 --> 45:45.040
can't actually see, so you're relying very much on the electronics at the moment, and you're told

45:45.040 --> 45:51.520
that there isn't enough power to run both of these ways of getting information about where you are,

45:53.440 --> 46:00.560
which bank of instruments is more important to you, surely the one that minimizes the

46:00.560 --> 46:06.640
likelihood of your crashing the plane. And what I suggest is that if you adopt the right hemisphere's

46:07.360 --> 46:12.000
way of looking at the world, you are not likely to crash the plane. Whereas if you adopt the left

46:12.000 --> 46:15.920
hemisphere's view of the world, you do crash the plane. And in a way, that's what I've just

46:15.920 --> 46:21.360
preferred to, the destruction that's going on all around us as we think about the world in this

46:21.360 --> 46:26.560
deeply fallacious way. Yes. And as the plane is crashing, the left hemisphere would insist

46:26.560 --> 46:32.560
of bringing forth their own solutions in order to fix the problem in his thought he's been

46:32.560 --> 46:36.880
causing, right? So again, this is kind of the self-circular nature of the problem.

46:41.360 --> 46:46.320
I might say, so just particularly the way of the left hemisphere, which is self-referential,

46:46.320 --> 46:51.840
because it can't break out as it were into reality. It's dealing all the time with its map,

46:51.840 --> 46:57.440
and it's saying, yes, but the map says, and it is left on denial about what is happening. And this

46:57.440 --> 47:02.480
is rather like, experienced this a couple of times, and people tell me about this happening to them,

47:02.640 --> 47:07.280
that they're navigating in a car using a sat-nav and their passenger is saying,

47:07.280 --> 47:11.120
well, the sat-nav says we're there, but you look out at the window, we're not there at all,

47:11.120 --> 47:15.280
we're just in another place, you must not know what the sat-nav says. And that is really the

47:15.280 --> 47:20.320
left hemisphere. It says, well, the sat-nav says it doesn't look out of the window. And it's trying

47:20.320 --> 47:26.480
to get people to look out of the window that I'm aiming to do in this book. Exactly. Sorry. No,

47:26.480 --> 47:31.520
it's perfect because this is also a way to summarize. It will be, yes, trust your abstractions,

47:31.600 --> 47:41.120
but cherish your own experience, which is a big caveat, both for academics, but also,

47:42.080 --> 47:47.920
I don't know, probably the real world people, too, including us, of course. But there is,

47:47.920 --> 47:54.320
again, this trend of thinking that insists that, well, we need to doubt, which is a healthy skepticism.

47:54.320 --> 48:00.240
Sure. But if we doubt to the point where nothing of what I can experience can bring forth any

48:01.200 --> 48:07.840
any wave on me deciding what's going on in the world, and I just outsource these more and more

48:07.840 --> 48:13.600
to abstractions, my abstractions or some abstractions that I borrow, I think we end up in this situation

48:13.600 --> 48:20.320
where we are in the middle of nowhere, but the GPS says we arrived at the place and we can find a

48:20.320 --> 48:26.480
way to just, well, maybe if I step out of the car and look around, I realize that we've made a mistake

48:26.480 --> 48:33.600
and that's fine, we can't correct it. It's fine to correct the mistake. Okay, in wrapping up,

48:33.600 --> 48:38.400
unless you want to add something on this, because I want to start writing, because you're not in a hurry.

48:39.680 --> 48:47.440
No, well, what we haven't, of course, endeavored to do and perhaps can't in one go is to paint some

48:47.440 --> 48:53.680
of the differences between the two hemispheres. And as I say, I'm not sure that that can be

48:53.680 --> 49:00.640
done just like that now, but one of them that's very relevant is the left hemisphere's capacity

49:00.640 --> 49:06.320
for denial and for false optimism. The left hemisphere, as far as it's concerned, there is

49:06.320 --> 49:14.000
never a problem because it's always in control and it's always right. It actually physically will

49:15.600 --> 49:22.560
look at a paralyzed limb and say it's not paralyzed. So somebody after a right hemisphere stroke,

49:22.560 --> 49:28.480
relying only on their left hemisphere, may have a completely paralyzed left half of the body,

49:28.480 --> 49:33.760
but the functioning left hemisphere will say, but it's functioning fine. Because this is what

49:33.760 --> 49:41.040
we're up against. Yes, and I must admit that when I read those chapters, I was literally mind blown

49:41.040 --> 49:47.920
and I couldn't believe really what can go wrong with their own minds. And it read like science

49:47.920 --> 49:52.480
fiction, but it wasn't science fiction, it was neurology. And maybe just for our listeners,

49:52.480 --> 49:58.080
because now we're saying, well, the left hemisphere says or things the right. But I promise, I can

49:58.080 --> 50:02.640
make a promise because it has been fulfilled for me as I was reading your book, that as we move

50:02.640 --> 50:10.320
through the detailed evidence and also its significance, it would be clear this is not just

50:12.000 --> 50:17.680
just, and I maybe shouldn't just say just, but this is not a philosophical position only.

50:17.680 --> 50:24.400
This is really what you get exactly as you see what actually happens when the left or the right

50:24.400 --> 50:32.160
part of the brain is screwed up. And from here, it's from where you're drawing these statements

50:32.160 --> 50:40.240
that it is in denial and so on, which brings us back to the fact that we are trapped and maybe

50:40.240 --> 50:47.200
into its ways forward to entrap ourselves, which is where I think the book that you've written

50:47.760 --> 50:54.960
over the last 10 years with nearly 2,000 pages, 1,600 pages and hundreds of references.

50:55.520 --> 51:01.920
Well, I think this is the major contribution beyond science and philosophy. It's to show

51:02.480 --> 51:07.200
a path and it's not just an argument, as you say, in the very first line of the book. It's not just

51:07.200 --> 51:14.480
an argument, but it's not just an argument. It's a journey that hopefully while we finish

51:14.560 --> 51:20.480
it, or as we are walking through the journey, we may realize that there are these views,

51:20.480 --> 51:25.520
ways of looking that we are not enjoying so much as we could. So maybe this is also to

51:25.520 --> 51:30.560
put it in a more positive note. It's not just a battle between bad ways and good ways, but

51:30.560 --> 51:36.960
it's also a joyful journey. I think that's also part of what's going to happen as we go through

51:37.520 --> 51:42.640
the means to truth or the portals to truth, which is part one, and the paths to truth,

51:42.640 --> 51:47.840
which is part two, and part three, and so on, is that we're going to walk through attention,

51:47.840 --> 51:55.360
perception, judgment, science, reason, imagination, and consciousness, matter, time, space, the sacred,

51:55.360 --> 52:02.240
and it's going to be a joyful trip. And I think that's a good mark that we're doing something

52:03.600 --> 52:10.080
good enough or right or true, that there's this joy in reading it. It's not like reading

52:10.080 --> 52:16.400
philosophy or science when it is presented as a mathematical theorem. You must obey and

52:16.400 --> 52:21.680
walk through that path, but it's both an argument and an offering, if you allow me to say that.

52:21.680 --> 52:28.320
And I think this is fascinating, and I'm grateful that you wrote it in this way.

52:29.760 --> 52:35.760
Well, thanks very much, Alex. I think that is a good point. In a way, what I'm suggesting is that

52:35.840 --> 52:41.440
the sort of questions we want to answer are not susceptible of resolution by purely rational

52:41.440 --> 52:49.040
argument, not by anyone else's. I do offer arguments as we go through that I hope are

52:49.040 --> 52:53.360
persuasive, but the most persuasive thing, if you're trying to get somebody to see the world

52:53.360 --> 52:58.320
a different way, is not just to sit in a seminar room and argue about it, but to go out into the

52:58.320 --> 53:05.280
world and have a look. And this is how empirical science works. And it's also how a kind of empirical

53:05.280 --> 53:12.480
philosophy works. And what I reckon is that if you accompany me as you have on this trip and look

53:12.480 --> 53:19.280
at the evidence of what happens to human beings when they're forced to rely on one way of thinking

53:19.280 --> 53:25.600
at the expense of another, it demonstrates, I mean, I can't help you if you don't see what I see,

53:25.600 --> 53:33.200
and that's fair enough. But for those who want to see, I believe I show that one of these views

53:33.200 --> 53:39.840
of the world is more reliable than the other. Importantly, that doesn't mean that the other

53:39.840 --> 53:44.720
way of looking, the left hemisphere way of looking is wrong. It's just limited. It's very

53:44.720 --> 53:50.640
limited. And it's limited with a purpose in mind to enable us to grab stuff. And that's not nothing.

53:50.640 --> 53:57.040
We won't live if we can't eat and build shelter and so on. But that is not the tool whereby we

53:57.040 --> 54:04.240
come to understand the world. To do that, we need to bring many strands from experience,

54:04.240 --> 54:09.920
from intuition, from science, from reason together. And people who don't do that actually

54:10.720 --> 54:19.600
have a fairly common mental illness. What is remarkable is that schizophrenia is really an

54:19.600 --> 54:25.440
example of what happens to people who have to rationalize about everything. They can't start

54:25.440 --> 54:31.840
from any bed of experience at all. And it's a point not just made by me, but made by others

54:31.840 --> 54:39.360
before me, that when people are schizophrenic, it's not that they have lost their reason,

54:39.360 --> 54:44.800
as we say in English, I don't know if one does in Spanish, say that a mad person has lost his

54:44.800 --> 54:50.960
reason. It's not just that, but that they have lost everything but their reason and they have to

54:51.600 --> 54:57.680
argue for and deduce things, as it were, theoretically, that most of us do intuitively

54:57.680 --> 55:02.720
from a grounding in the real world. How interesting. Yes, you see how language

55:02.720 --> 55:08.800
serves to both show and also conceal, because it's saying the opposite and it's a nice trick.

55:08.800 --> 55:14.880
Well, one more thing to add, because you prompted me this thought where you mentioned it's not

55:15.760 --> 55:22.400
just about rational argument. And that's where many people become very nervous, right? Because

55:22.400 --> 55:28.480
since a rational argument like this sort of rationality is not just a good instrument,

55:28.480 --> 55:35.280
which of course it is, but it's the only instrument allowed. And now when you do these

55:35.280 --> 55:39.760
synthesis, because that's also what you propose, and also these conversions, because it's not just

55:39.840 --> 55:46.560
the synthesis from one realm, but the conversions, synthesis, and you make explicit what starts to

55:46.560 --> 55:52.480
become difficult, I would guess, to articulate, because the moment you're just talking about

55:53.360 --> 55:58.320
what's super-rational or what's not only rational, maybe beyond rational, including it,

55:58.320 --> 56:02.480
but including it, right? That's the beauty of it. It's not rejecting it, of course, including it,

56:03.040 --> 56:09.120
and intuition and imagination. I think, Ian, what you're doing is you're going, if I may say so,

56:09.120 --> 56:15.600
and many people may not feel comfortable with this either, but it's like going a bit forward in human

56:15.600 --> 56:23.680
evolution. It's like, well, as a species and our human mind has excelled, no doubt, with reason and

56:23.680 --> 56:30.800
with many other abilities, you may say, but the moment we start to talk more openly and precisely

56:32.000 --> 56:38.960
and accurately about imagination and intuition, I think we're in a new path. Well, it's a well

56:38.960 --> 56:44.240
floating path, but it's a good path, because we're making progress. We are not always all around

56:44.240 --> 56:50.240
congratulating ourselves as to how enlightened we could be, but we are also acknowledging that there

56:50.800 --> 56:56.960
is something else, and perhaps that's also why you have this amazing book, sorry, you know,

56:56.960 --> 57:01.520
book. It's a chapter, but that's something that happens with your chapters, that they could all

57:01.520 --> 57:08.240
be books by themselves, where you talk about consciousness, which is one of my favorite

57:08.240 --> 57:14.400
chapters, but also the sacred at the very end. So here we have somebody that's very knowledgeable

57:14.400 --> 57:22.640
in neurology and physics and philosophy, and at the end is writing about the sacred, and they should

57:22.640 --> 57:32.000
not scare academics or real world people, and they should excite or at least make them feel

57:32.560 --> 57:39.360
grateful for a chapter on the sacred, right? But you see how we are not just walking the fine line,

57:39.360 --> 57:44.560
as I was telling you before, but also getting into a point where it's a kind of an edge,

57:44.560 --> 57:52.640
there's this mist, and you start not to see the accuracy of the data of mathematical

57:52.640 --> 57:58.480
theorem demonstration, but you're in this place where, to be honest, this is where I think we

57:59.040 --> 58:03.440
we need to go, and we should not be scared, I think we should be enjoyed, and you're going

58:03.440 --> 58:12.080
into that place, and I think that's also remarkable. Yes, thank you. Well, what I wanted in this book

58:12.080 --> 58:22.000
was to show the confluence that I see between findings in neurology, trends in the last 100

58:22.000 --> 58:29.600
years in philosophy, and findings in physics. I'm not a physicist, Alex, as you are, but I do,

58:30.480 --> 58:36.240
I have, rather to my surprise, I found myself being approached by quite a number of physicists who'd

58:36.240 --> 58:42.000
read the master and his emissary and said this is incredibly relevant to what we are dealing with,

58:42.000 --> 58:48.000
and so I do have people that I can try out my ideas on before I write them, but in any case,

58:48.080 --> 58:55.600
the point is that these, apparently, to our way of thinking, quite distinct paths of neuropsychology,

58:55.600 --> 59:00.560
data philosophy, and data physics come together, and it's like starting from

59:02.000 --> 59:07.120
points on the circumference of a circle and going inwards and coming together, and what is also

59:07.120 --> 59:14.320
interesting to me is that the picture that coheres there is also recognizable in the great

59:14.320 --> 59:22.240
ancient traditions of philosophy around the world. It agrees with the findings of ancient wisdom

59:22.240 --> 59:29.920
traditions, hence the idea that we can just not say anything about the idea of value, like goodness,

59:29.920 --> 59:34.800
beauty, truth, all of the sacred, you know, scientists and philosophers better keep off

59:34.800 --> 59:40.240
those things. I mean, that is not the way it is for me, and what I hope is that people might start

59:40.320 --> 59:46.160
out this book, I don't know, some of them, rather thinking, well, he's got a difficult

59:46.160 --> 59:50.640
furrow to plow, if he's going to convince me that it's worth talking about these subjects,

59:50.640 --> 59:55.680
but I hope that after following me through the book, if they have the patience and courage to do so,

59:56.240 --> 01:00:02.320
they will find that it's absolutely essential and that, in a way, only somebody who was rather

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:08.640
blinkered would think, no, you can't bring these into the picture, they are at the core of the picture.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.120
Yes, indeed. So, you know, we are there in the car, the GPS, we're not sure if it's working,

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:19.600
we can look through the window and we can ask the indigenous people around, and if now the GPS

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:26.320
and your site and your own orientation and what the locals tell you seems to start converging,

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:33.360
this is a good sign that we are approaching the place we want to get at, even though we will never

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:37.040
really get at it, but in this process, we're getting closer.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.080
I love that, that's a very nice way of putting it, thank you.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:53.120
Well, just for me to add, I hope this suffix is a good enough invitation for anyone to read your

01:00:53.120 --> 01:01:06.640
book and we will continue, hopefully, unpacking it, enjoying it. Again, for me, it's an honor to

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.880
do so with you. Well, it is a hugely important experience for me to have somebody with your

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:19.760
breadth of background responding so positively to it, and I hope that we will actually make this

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:26.160
journey together and bring some listeners and viewers with us on that path. Great, so let's

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:33.840
leave it at that, thank you. All right, goodbye for now then, Alex. Yes, see you soon. Until next time.
