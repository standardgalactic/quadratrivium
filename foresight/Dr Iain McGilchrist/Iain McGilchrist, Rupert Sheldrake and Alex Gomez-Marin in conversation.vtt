00:00.000 --> 00:14.800
Okay, so I feel like I am the luckiest and happiest corpus callosum, separating and

00:14.800 --> 00:20.600
reaching these two gentlemen, Ima Gilchrist and Rupert Sheldrake. I've had the honor

00:20.600 --> 00:25.560
and pleasure to spend many hours in conversation with you two, and we're here at Rupert's

00:25.560 --> 00:32.560
house because we've recorded a series of conversations with Rupert and also with Iain. The last

00:32.560 --> 00:36.680
one covering his book The Matter With Things, and so we couldn't miss this opportunity to

00:36.680 --> 00:41.800
be the three of us, and especially you two in conversation, so I'm really glad we're

00:41.800 --> 00:51.080
doing this. So am I. Me too. So let's start with any curiosity back and forth, maybe

00:51.080 --> 00:56.320
from Rupert about the hemisphere apothesis, and perhaps from me and Rupert about morphic

00:56.320 --> 01:02.440
resonance, and then see where we go. All right. Well, I confess I haven't read the whole of

01:02.440 --> 01:08.200
your book, but I've read several chats of it, and I've watched many of your talks and

01:08.200 --> 01:13.640
so on, and one thing I deduced is that it's something to do with the two hemispheres of

01:13.640 --> 01:22.000
the brain. That has come through quite loud and clear in every chapter, and there are

01:22.000 --> 01:29.840
two things I'm curious about, about the hemispheres and your chosen central terrain. One is that

01:29.840 --> 01:37.400
when people started doing these split brain operations, they were done, I think for epileptics

01:37.400 --> 01:42.160
mainly, weren't they? They severed the corpus callosum that joins the two halves of the

01:42.160 --> 01:50.160
brain together, and this enabled Sperry and other scientists to look at the lateralization

01:50.160 --> 01:54.560
of function in the two hemispheres, and they had to do very sophisticated experiments to

01:54.560 --> 02:02.280
show this, that all that leads to this idea of differentiated function. But the bit that

02:02.280 --> 02:10.680
interests me is that they were doing these operations on patients who had their brain

02:10.680 --> 02:15.320
split in two, or at least all down to, there were still a few connections in the basal

02:15.320 --> 02:20.200
brain, but largely severed the connections between them, and the reason they were able

02:20.200 --> 02:26.640
to do this and go on doing it was because when people went home, it seemed to have solved

02:26.640 --> 02:32.920
the seizure problem, and they seemed perfectly normal. And for me, that's the most astonishing

02:32.920 --> 02:37.640
thing of all in this research, that people who had had their brain completely cut in

02:37.640 --> 02:43.240
two, not completely, but largely cut in two, worked to coordinate the movements of both

02:43.240 --> 02:51.000
sides of their body, their mouth moved, coordinated as they spoke, their spouses and loved ones

02:51.000 --> 02:58.120
hardly noticed any difference. And for me, that suggests either that the nervous connections

02:58.120 --> 03:06.200
to the two halves of the brain are completely or largely unnecessary, which is very surprising,

03:06.200 --> 03:12.440
or that the coordination between the two halves of the brain, which must be there in order

03:12.440 --> 03:18.040
to walk and speak and swim and dance and do all the normal movements of life. I'm just

03:18.080 --> 03:23.280
talking about motor coordination here, not just about, you know, the more sophisticated

03:23.280 --> 03:29.720
cognitive functions, that then there must be still some coordination to the two halves

03:29.720 --> 03:34.680
of the brain. And for me, that suggests there's a kind of resonance between the two halves

03:34.680 --> 03:40.680
of the brain resonate, either electromagnetically or through something like morphic resonance,

03:40.680 --> 03:46.880
that there's an overall wholeness within which these two parts are coordinated by resonance.

03:46.880 --> 03:52.880
They're not coordinated by direct nervous connections, as one might otherwise have assumed.

03:52.880 --> 03:57.520
So for me, it raises a completely different view of how the brain may actually work and

03:57.520 --> 04:04.520
how the two hemispheres may be coordinated. What would you think about that? I mean, why

04:04.520 --> 04:10.760
is it that severing the connection of corpus callosum that links the two halves has so

04:10.760 --> 04:12.640
little manifest effect?

04:13.400 --> 04:17.800
The first thing to say is that the corpus callosum, many people don't realize, is a

04:17.800 --> 04:24.480
mammalian invention. So although reptiles, amphibians, and many other creatures lower

04:24.480 --> 04:33.480
down that tree have two centers in their brain, they're not connected in this direct way.

04:33.480 --> 04:39.840
Corpus callosum started with the first mammals. The second thing I think that's worth reflecting

04:39.840 --> 04:45.800
on is that it's not uncommon for people to be born with what's called colossal age

04:45.800 --> 04:50.240
genesis, in other words, they don't have a corpus callosum, and it's often a chance

04:50.240 --> 04:58.240
finding a postmortem. So quite clearly, the finding that you can sever the connection

04:58.240 --> 05:06.680
and people can lead a reasonably normal life, almost impossible really to, if casually encountered,

05:06.680 --> 05:11.520
you wouldn't notice that there was a problem. These are consonant findings and they are

05:11.520 --> 05:21.920
a bit mysterious, I agree. But what they think they show is that, first of all, this direct

05:21.920 --> 05:26.600
connection between the hemispheres is not the only way in which the two hemispheres can

05:26.600 --> 05:33.360
communicate. For example, they very obviously share a body and the eyes and the senses take

05:33.400 --> 05:38.680
in both parts of the body, so they know where, if you like, they can sense outwardly as well

05:38.680 --> 05:48.240
as inwardly what's going on. Mostly in these cases, the operation was done in somebody who

05:48.240 --> 05:54.880
had a longish life and had got used to the coordination of the two hemispheres. They

05:54.880 --> 06:00.680
communicate with one another through the endocrine system. There are all sorts of ways in which

06:00.880 --> 06:08.880
they have a common internal environment. And as you say, they communicate at the level

06:08.880 --> 06:15.280
of the brainstem and even a little bit above it. So there is definitely connection there

06:15.280 --> 06:23.560
of a kind. I don't know quite how to understand the resonance though, because the immediate

06:23.560 --> 06:27.880
question is, I mean, when you think of things resonating, you think the brain waves from

06:27.960 --> 06:33.400
this hemisphere are they literally resonating with the other hemisphere? I don't know of

06:33.400 --> 06:38.960
any evidence of that. So what sort of a resonance exactly is it that they might have?

06:38.960 --> 06:46.280
Well, I'm not sure, but what I think of it, say that there was a field, a morphic field

06:46.280 --> 06:51.640
covering the whole brain and brain activity, that included within it the activity of the

06:51.640 --> 06:57.280
two hemispheres, then the way in which they're coordinated might be through this field,

06:57.400 --> 07:03.520
co-ordinating the two parts within a larger hole. And the coordination wouldn't necessarily

07:03.520 --> 07:10.520
mean that one echoes the other in a most literal resonance way. But the way in which, say, the

07:10.520 --> 07:16.520
different organs of the body, or say, different atoms within a molecule are coordinated within

07:16.520 --> 07:24.520
a larger field. Now, if you take a molecule, a very simple molecule like H2O or CO2, the

07:25.200 --> 07:32.200
atoms, the carbon and the two oxygens in carbon dioxide, are bound together by bonds. But

07:32.200 --> 07:37.240
the bonds that bind them together have an electron cloud that goes around the whole molecule.

07:37.240 --> 07:42.240
Covalently bonded molecules have a cloud of electrons surrounding the whole molecule,

07:42.240 --> 07:46.760
like a membrane around the whole molecule. And the bond between the actual individual

07:46.760 --> 07:53.280
atoms is there are shared electrons that bond them. But there's a cloud, an electron cloud,

07:53.360 --> 07:58.440
around the whole thing. And the vibratory patterns of carbon and oxygen within a CO2,

07:58.440 --> 08:03.800
they have different vibratory patterns, but they're coordinated together by an overall

08:03.800 --> 08:10.800
field which influences both through its influence on their vibratory frequencies and coordinates

08:10.960 --> 08:16.480
them and is sensitive to changes in both in a way that communicates it to the other.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.560
Something like that. I mean, this is a crude model and I haven't actually tried to work

08:20.640 --> 08:27.640
it out in detail. But some overarching field of whatever kind, I mean, my favorite kind

08:28.640 --> 08:35.640
of morphic fields, but some overarching, organizing field in which both are parts and which coordinates

08:35.640 --> 08:40.640
the two, would seem to me to be one way of thinking about this.

08:40.640 --> 08:46.560
Well, immediately, of course, I think of the way in which quantum field theory suggests

08:46.560 --> 08:53.560
that the way we tend to think in terms of little balls or particles is at most of metaphorical

08:55.520 --> 09:01.160
meaning. And that what is being referred to there is a very particular state of something

09:01.160 --> 09:08.160
that is an overall field that has energy and exerts influence. So such fields are very

09:09.160 --> 09:15.440
basic. And without the idea that there is some sort of coordinating field, it's difficult

09:15.440 --> 09:22.320
to explain how a simple organism, a single cell organism, can detect changes and respond

09:22.320 --> 09:29.320
to them in other parts of even that cell. I mean, this is something that has been puzzled

09:30.920 --> 09:37.920
over by many biologists. And there seems to be some overall coordination. And of course

09:38.440 --> 09:44.880
this goes much further when you come to a multicellular organism and how do the various parts of this

09:44.960 --> 09:49.560
organism know that certain things need to be responded to elsewhere in the organism?

09:49.560 --> 09:54.400
Look, we don't at the moment have any way of understanding how this communication takes

09:54.400 --> 10:01.400
place. Yes. You see, I think it even applies to physical systems like crystals. I mean,

10:01.920 --> 10:07.000
there's a longstanding problem, as you know, with snowflakes. You know, Johannes Kepler

10:07.000 --> 10:12.360
wrote a monograph on the six-sided snowflake. I didn't actually know. He did. Yes, he was

10:12.400 --> 10:17.600
fascinated by snowflakes. All these people have taken wonderful pictures of snowflakes.

10:17.600 --> 10:24.120
You know, Bentley is one of the great ones, the classic pictures. What you see with the

10:24.120 --> 10:30.360
snowflake is they all have six sides or arms. And the six arms are the same as each other.

10:30.360 --> 10:36.640
But each snowflake is different. Exactly. So the thing is, how come they're coordinated?

10:36.640 --> 10:41.160
Because you could say, well, the particular branches on the thing are random to do with

10:41.200 --> 10:45.480
the immediate environment. But then you'd have to say to explain the whole snowflake

10:45.480 --> 10:50.920
being the same. The every arm of the growing snowflake was exactly the same on that snowflake.

10:50.920 --> 10:55.440
And they're all the same just because they were in exactly the same fluctuating environment,

10:55.440 --> 11:00.800
fluctuating in the same way. And the next snowflake was in a completely different environment.

11:00.800 --> 11:07.800
Or you could say, as intriguingly the late editor of Nature, Sir John Maddox, no friend

11:08.360 --> 11:15.120
of mine in many ways, puzzling over this question of snowflakes, said there must be some kind

11:15.120 --> 11:21.120
of internal resonance within the lattice structure of the snowflake that enables it to be co-ordinated.

11:21.120 --> 11:28.120
It must be reading you. Possibly. But you see, there are resonances within crystal lattices,

11:30.280 --> 11:37.040
there are resonant patterns and harmonics and stuff. And so say there's a co-ordination

11:37.080 --> 11:42.160
between these seemingly separate arms of the snowflake, which could depend on some kind

11:42.160 --> 11:48.520
of field that's over and above the individual arms. So that's the kind of model. And one

11:48.520 --> 11:55.520
would expect with any holistic model of organisms that there's a field for the entire body that

11:55.640 --> 12:01.200
helps coordinate the development of the body and all the organs within it. But this field

12:01.200 --> 12:08.200
also helps coordinate development of different parts. So for example, when the fingerprint

12:09.240 --> 12:15.160
patterns are similar on right and left hands, and when the right and left hand side of the

12:15.160 --> 12:20.840
faces are similar, they're not exactly the same, of course. But I think in normal morphogenesis

12:20.840 --> 12:26.200
there's a kind of right-left resonance going on all the time, which helps coordinate bilaterally

12:26.280 --> 12:31.920
symmetrical structures. Now, of course, the brain's not exactly bilaterally symmetrical

12:31.920 --> 12:38.920
as one of the points that we know from its anatomy as well as its function. But some

12:38.920 --> 12:44.920
overarching field that enables this to happen. That to me is why one reason I myself got

12:44.920 --> 12:49.160
interested in split brains in a sense, the opposite from your own interest, which is

12:49.160 --> 12:55.400
about the differences. And I was just interested in how come the co-ordination is still so

12:55.440 --> 13:01.640
remarkable and so integrated that we don't experience two, most people don't experience

13:01.640 --> 13:06.520
two sub-personalities all the time. And the idea of a co-ordinating field that includes

13:06.520 --> 13:13.520
both and co-ordinates both would help to explain why we don't go around with right-hand

13:15.000 --> 13:21.200
Rupert and left-hand Rupert, one with a wonderfully integrated view of the world and the other

13:21.320 --> 13:24.240
with a kind of obsessive literal one.

13:24.240 --> 13:31.240
Is your question perhaps rephrased by saying, is there an organizing principle that unites

13:31.440 --> 13:35.280
the master and his emissary? Or can the master do it on its own?

13:35.280 --> 13:40.640
No, I think one way of thinking about what you're talking about is that just as in the

13:40.640 --> 13:45.280
developing organism there needs to be differentiation, say that on one side of the body there'll

13:45.360 --> 13:52.360
be a liver on the other, you know, spleen and so on. These things are also part of a single

13:53.120 --> 14:00.120
overarching field, if you like. And the brain could be seen as similarly asymmetrical, but

14:00.960 --> 14:07.720
part of that asymmetry is already part of a single field. I think you must have been

14:07.720 --> 14:14.480
reading McGilchrist, actually, because of course I have wonderful images of snowflakes, actually,

14:14.520 --> 14:21.480
and talk about exactly this issue, which also occurs in deer antlers, for example.

14:21.480 --> 14:27.040
Deer antlers have a particular form peculiar to that deer. If you cut them off, they regenerate

14:27.040 --> 14:34.040
exactly according to that pattern, but where this pattern is stored is not known. So overall

14:34.040 --> 14:39.800
we have problems that are generally neglected because they're difficult to answer, but as

14:39.840 --> 14:45.080
soon as you start thinking about it in a more inquiring way, which I would have thought

14:45.080 --> 14:50.280
was the point of science, that's a difficult question. How is it that these things have

14:50.280 --> 14:57.280
this overall confusion? I mean, no, for example, in the brain, I forget the exact figure, but

14:58.160 --> 15:04.660
it's something staggering, like 500,000 neurons are generated every minute in the business

15:04.700 --> 15:11.700
of gestation in the womb, and all those neurons have to end up precisely in the right place

15:12.420 --> 15:18.420
in the brain, and the brain has minute architectural... Where exactly is this information stored

15:18.420 --> 15:25.420
about the three-dimensional structure alone of the brain? I don't think it can be even

15:25.420 --> 15:32.420
encoded in simple linear code in the sense that we think of code. Of course, we've now

15:32.580 --> 15:36.780
dropped the idea that it's a taller linear code in the way the computer is coded, but

15:36.780 --> 15:41.780
instead must be a three-dimensional code, and so we know about the conformation in epigenetics

15:41.780 --> 15:48.780
of the genes involved. But nonetheless, where is this... You don't see anywhere in that

15:50.300 --> 15:57.300
this intricate three-dimensional structure stored, and the simplest thing I can imagine

15:58.060 --> 16:04.100
is that there is some overarching field. Can I just add a couple of other amusing or interesting

16:04.100 --> 16:11.100
things? I mean, one is the striking fact that people who are born without limbs nonetheless

16:11.100 --> 16:16.660
have the sense of the limbs. They've never had them, but nonetheless, they have an internal

16:16.660 --> 16:23.660
sense of those limbs, and Ramachandra describes a woman who had no limbs, no upper limbs,

16:24.660 --> 16:30.660
having phantom limbs, which she couldn't stop gesticulating when she talked. So this

16:30.660 --> 16:37.660
part of evolutionary history, the hand movements are coordinated with speech, was there in

16:37.660 --> 16:42.340
her, although she had never experienced hands or arms. The other thing, which is raised

16:42.340 --> 16:49.340
by F. S. Schiller, the Victorian philosopher, Oxford philosopher, which is a very good

16:49.340 --> 16:55.340
point, is we know, of course, that when people have damage to one part of the brain, other

16:55.340 --> 17:01.340
parts of the brain can take over the function. But how is this coordinated? How does one

17:01.340 --> 17:07.340
part of the brain that's supposedly doing whatever it does know we need speech? How

17:07.340 --> 17:13.340
are we going to get it back? I mean, in a way, there's a need for something overarching

17:14.340 --> 17:20.340
to draw out that function in a new place in the brain.

17:20.340 --> 17:26.340
Well, of course, my own starting point for my ideas on morphogenetic resonance was morphogenetic

17:26.340 --> 17:31.340
fields, form-shaping fields. And I started my scientific career working on plant development.

17:31.340 --> 17:32.340
Yes.

17:32.340 --> 17:39.340
And how is it that leaves and flowers and stem ends and so on develop? And the idea of morphogenetic

17:40.340 --> 17:47.340
fields, first put forward in the 1920s, was exactly that of a coordinating field that

17:47.340 --> 17:53.340
brings forth these patterns, and underlies regeneration. And so, for example, in the

17:57.340 --> 18:04.340
regeneration of salamander eyes, so-called wolfian regeneration, you cut out the lens

18:04.340 --> 18:10.340
of the eye of a new torus salamander, and it will regenerate new lens from the edge of

18:10.340 --> 18:15.340
the iris, which is not how the lens forms in the embryo, it forms by folding in the skin

18:15.340 --> 18:22.340
from the outside. So there's a completely filling and missing structure by modifying

18:22.340 --> 18:29.340
some other structure would never normally be modified to create, to fill that function.

18:30.340 --> 18:37.340
And all this similar kind of coordination applies in social insects. If you remove some

18:37.340 --> 18:43.340
of the workers, or remove some of the soldiers, or remove some of the hive, or something. The

18:43.340 --> 18:48.340
whole system re-adjusts, they stop doing what they're doing, some of them take on different

18:48.340 --> 18:55.340
functions and roles. So these coordinating fields, I think, underlie all of biology,

18:55.340 --> 19:02.340
all of nature of self-organizing systems. And phantom limbs are particularly interesting

19:02.340 --> 19:08.340
because I think in a phantom limb, the phantom is the field of the limb which is experienced

19:08.340 --> 19:14.340
from within, but which doesn't have a material structure associated with it. And as you may

19:14.340 --> 19:20.340
know, one of the experiments that I proposed in my book Seven Experiments That Could Change

19:20.340 --> 19:27.340
the World is on detecting phantom limbs. I recruit amputees through veterans' organizations,

19:27.340 --> 19:33.340
tried recruiting them through hospitals, but they were extremely uncooperative. And then

19:33.340 --> 19:40.340
I have the phantom amputee, but they push their phantom arm through one of six positions

19:40.340 --> 19:48.340
in a barrier, a door, for example. And on the other side, that's done in a randomized sequence,

19:48.340 --> 19:54.340
on the other side, I have people who do subtle energy medicine, Reiki, Helos, and so on. And

19:54.340 --> 19:59.340
one at a time, I lead them in, I say, one of those panels has a phantom arm sticking through

19:59.340 --> 20:04.340
it, and the others don't, which has got the phantom, and they sort of feel in different

20:04.340 --> 20:10.340
places. And they say that one, and they write more than chance so far, substantially more

20:10.340 --> 20:15.340
than chance. So the main objection I've had to this is, well, how do you know it's not

20:15.340 --> 20:22.340
telepathy? If we've moved, if the skeptic of the argument says, it must be telepathy,

20:22.340 --> 20:27.340
and we've moved it. That's beautiful. Yes, yes. But then, as a test for that, I haven't

20:27.340 --> 20:32.340
done this yet, but the control, the telepathy control is you ask them to imagine pushing

20:32.340 --> 20:37.340
their phantom arm through, or you ask them to extend their phantom arm with a step back

20:37.340 --> 20:42.340
yard or two to start with and extend it so it doesn't actually go through the door.

20:42.340 --> 20:49.340
And so that would be another control. Now, these experiments are not expensive. In fact,

20:49.340 --> 20:56.340
they're free. So I think that actually this whole question can be taken much further. This

20:56.340 --> 21:05.340
is not the kind of thing people do in labs at the moment, but they could. But before

21:06.340 --> 21:13.340
we leave the subject of the divided brain and all that, I have a more, probably a simpler

21:13.340 --> 21:21.340
easy to answer question. You could probably refer me to page 3027 in your Magnum Office,

21:21.340 --> 21:30.340
which is, I'm a pianist, and so obviously playing the piano involves coordinating the

21:30.340 --> 21:36.340
right and the left hand. And the left hand, which mainly does the rhythmic section as

21:36.340 --> 21:42.340
well, is clearly controlled by the right brain. And the right hand, which does the sort of

21:42.340 --> 21:49.340
melody and all the rest is by the left brain. And in playing the piano, these are coordinated.

21:49.340 --> 21:55.340
And how does this map on to your interpretation? I'm sure it maps wonderfully well, but I just

21:55.340 --> 22:01.340
love to know how. Well, one of the mysteries is that music is abnormally lateralized in

22:01.340 --> 22:08.340
the brain of performers. So in the general population who are not professional musicians

22:08.340 --> 22:16.340
or full-time musicians, the only bit of music that is really understood or interpreted by

22:16.340 --> 22:25.340
the left hemisphere is rhythm. And melody and harmony are almost exclusively understood

22:25.340 --> 22:31.340
and experienced in the right hemisphere. So that seems on the face of it very different

22:31.340 --> 22:39.340
from what you're describing. And one of the things is that for most instruments, the two

22:39.340 --> 22:43.340
hands need to be coordinated for all these activities. And so when you look at professional

22:43.340 --> 22:50.340
musicians, what I've just described is not the case. So they have developed a left hemisphere

22:50.340 --> 22:56.340
which is also capable of understanding melody and harmony. And the right hemisphere already

22:56.340 --> 23:02.340
actually understands rhythm anyway. In fact, complex rhythms in the ordinary person are

23:02.340 --> 23:06.340
understood by the right hemisphere, not by the left. It's only simple rhythms the left

23:06.340 --> 23:12.340
can get. The sort of thing that I constantly hear everywhere I go, blaring out of cars

23:12.340 --> 23:17.340
on speakers in shops and so on, which is just boom, boom, boom. That is the left hemisphere

23:17.340 --> 23:24.340
speaking. But I think what you're describing is an effortful coordination which actually

23:24.340 --> 23:30.340
modifies the brain. I see. Because you see, I thought on the basic, I mean my understanding

23:30.340 --> 23:37.340
of McGillchrist 101 was that actually the right and left hand should be reversed. And there's

23:37.340 --> 23:42.340
no reason why when the development of piano playing took place, the keyboards shouldn't

23:42.340 --> 23:47.340
have been the other way round. With the deep notes at the top. Yes. Well, yes, with the

23:47.340 --> 23:52.340
keyboard reversed. So you play with the left hemisphere, the right hand would do the rhythm

23:52.340 --> 23:57.340
and the left hand would do, I mean it could have been exactly the mirror image of the

23:57.340 --> 24:03.340
way it is now. There's nothing in the technology that says it has to be that way round. It's

24:03.340 --> 24:09.340
quite right. I never really thought about that. I think that you'd have to have had,

24:09.340 --> 24:17.340
not just a reversal of, you'd have to have had the higher notes on the left hands part

24:17.340 --> 24:22.340
of the scale. Yes. That's right. The thing is that in the brain there are certain things

24:22.340 --> 24:30.340
that are positionally, it seems like, for example, the sequence from left to right in which things

24:30.340 --> 24:39.340
grow is innate in, for example, chicks. They tend to see that a series of numbers grows

24:39.340 --> 24:44.340
as you move towards the right, which is the way in which we see from one to itself. And

24:44.340 --> 24:50.340
so we start from lower to higher. And it may be that this is also the way in which it seems

24:50.340 --> 24:58.340
fundamentally that the lower notes are basic. They are the base. And the other is what is

24:58.340 --> 25:04.340
built more complexly on top of it. And so it may be natural that an instrument developed

25:04.340 --> 25:09.340
in this way. But I haven't studied all instruments around the world to see whether or not there's

25:09.340 --> 25:14.340
a project for somebody with nothing else to do. Well, look at Islamic music, you see,

25:14.340 --> 25:19.340
because they read from right to left. Yes. And so their whole sense of the way things

25:19.340 --> 25:24.340
develop. Yes. You start at the back of the book by our criteria and you read from right

25:24.340 --> 25:29.340
to left. It's the exact opposite. Of course. If pianos had first been developed in the

25:29.340 --> 25:36.340
Caliphate, in Baghdad or somewhere, perhaps the upper part of the keyboard would have been

25:36.340 --> 25:42.340
the lower notes and the rhythm section, and it might have been a mirror image of existing pianos.

25:42.340 --> 25:47.340
It's a hypothetical, but some research, anthropological search, would be interesting.

25:47.340 --> 25:52.340
Yes. I don't know why it's ended up that way in brief, but that is the way it is. And

25:52.340 --> 25:59.340
it's also true, of course, of all instruments. I don't know of any instruments that are just

25:59.340 --> 26:04.340
played with one hand. I mean, it's one of the things we do, even with sort of playing a flute,

26:04.340 --> 26:09.340
playing a violin. Both hands have to be coordinated, at least in Western music, that is,

26:09.340 --> 26:16.340
almost as I think we know. So the hands have to work together in this way, and the brain

26:16.340 --> 26:21.340
is modified in those who do it, so that it can. I wonder how much learning the piano,

26:21.340 --> 26:27.340
you see, I started learning piano when I was five. I come from a musical family. And my son,

26:27.340 --> 26:33.340
Merlin, learned at five, Cosmo, who started learning at four. And that means from a very early

26:33.340 --> 26:40.340
age, they and lots and lots of other people have actually been using brains in a way that

26:40.340 --> 26:49.340
would be somewhat counterintuitive if they read McGillchrist first. So does this affect

26:49.340 --> 26:54.340
the actual development? Do people who learn the piano or other instruments at an early

26:54.340 --> 27:00.340
age develop differently? I mean, professional musicians, you said, are noticeably different.

27:00.340 --> 27:03.340
But what about amateur musicians who play every day?

27:03.340 --> 27:08.340
Well, of course, the distinction is not between amateur and professional, but between people

27:08.340 --> 27:13.340
who are constantly playing and those who are only occasionally playing. So I don't think

27:13.340 --> 27:20.340
there's a problem with that. But I would imagine that starting early to learn an instrument

27:20.340 --> 27:26.340
like this will modify, certainly we know in respect of the appreciation of sound that

27:26.340 --> 27:31.340
it does modify the brain. And I don't see why it should not modify the brain in other

27:31.340 --> 27:37.340
ways. You and your two sons have interesting brains that work perhaps slightly different

27:37.340 --> 27:47.340
from the standard Western brain. Yes. Yes. Well, that's a really interesting possibility,

27:47.340 --> 27:54.340
isn't it? I don't know if anybody has done more tests on professional pianists or, you

27:54.340 --> 27:59.340
know, I don't know of any. No. Well, it would be a good research area from the point of view

27:59.340 --> 28:04.340
of brain naturalization, wouldn't it? Absolutely. When I have seen reports saying the people

28:04.340 --> 28:10.340
who learn the piano or other instruments have a different way in which they think and stuff.

28:10.340 --> 28:16.340
Okay. But it would be an obvious thing to do because this involves a close coordination

28:16.340 --> 28:23.340
of the two hemispheres in a way that, I mean, we need it in every physical activity, walking,

28:23.340 --> 28:28.340
running, jumping, sports skills, presumably, you know, playing cricket, playing football,

28:28.340 --> 28:34.340
etc., right and left feet. Presumably all these physical skills involve coordination

28:34.340 --> 28:39.340
of hemispheres. Well, they do, but the difference is that the left hemisphere and the right

28:39.340 --> 28:45.340
hemisphere and motor performance each control the other. And there's not the, you know,

28:45.340 --> 28:50.340
there's the distinction that there is between melody, harmony and rhythm, if you see what

28:50.340 --> 28:57.340
I mean. Yes. So music introduces a whole different aspect. Yes. There's no reason to suppose

28:57.340 --> 29:03.340
that we should be discoordinated when we move. And then animals that have no corpus callosum

29:03.340 --> 29:09.340
are perfectly well coordinated. You know, this question of yours could be scaled up to

29:09.340 --> 29:16.340
in asking how could we nurture young brains so that they have an easier time to grasp the

29:16.340 --> 29:22.340
world as you've proposed in your book or another way to put it would be how to nurture the

29:22.340 --> 29:28.340
Ruperts and eons of the future, which is something I'm very concerned with. What can we do to

29:28.340 --> 29:34.340
facilitate those intuitions that you both have been pursuing in different ways, but

29:34.340 --> 29:42.340
scientifically and beyond? You know, if you have some thoughts on that. Well, one thought

29:42.340 --> 29:49.340
I have that seems relevant is that I think that to the extent that what you're asking

29:49.340 --> 29:58.340
for is people who think more flexibly. There is a problem with dogma in both in philosophy

29:58.340 --> 30:06.340
and in science. It's a natural tendency for things to ossify, to fix prematurely and not

30:06.340 --> 30:14.340
allow evolution. It's natural for thought to evolve. And to do this, it has to be creative.

30:15.340 --> 30:29.340
And the best kinds of thinking that will allow this are those in which analytic acumen is

30:29.340 --> 30:35.340
there, but coupled with rather like the left and the right hand, coupled with a more imaginative

30:35.340 --> 30:43.340
and intuitive way of thinking. And I describe the insights of many scientists and mathematicians

30:43.340 --> 30:49.340
and it's quite extraordinary how virtually all of them describe this so-called ah-ha

30:49.340 --> 30:57.340
moment as being the creative thing that reveals the new Gestalt. And this ah-ha moment is

30:57.340 --> 31:03.340
robustly associated with the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus of the right hemisphere.

31:03.340 --> 31:08.340
So we know that this is right hemisphere, mediate it. And the trouble with our education now

31:08.340 --> 31:13.340
is that it's very much technically orientated. More and more we're saying what's the point

31:13.340 --> 31:18.340
in teaching people unless it's teaching them some mechanical skill that will be useful to them.

31:18.340 --> 31:26.340
But in fact, the point of an education is to draw out of us our humanity. And humanity used to be

31:26.340 --> 31:34.340
part of what we discussed in school, the humanities. And I think that a greater emphasis on music,

31:34.340 --> 31:40.340
on poetry, which also involves very largely the right hemisphere, whereas ordinary

31:40.340 --> 31:46.340
discursive language is probably more dependent on the left hemisphere than on both.

31:46.340 --> 31:54.340
These ways of thinking should be part of the way we educate children. What do you say, Rupert?

31:54.340 --> 32:02.340
Yes. Well, I think there are some forms of education like sports, physical skills,

32:02.340 --> 32:08.340
crafts, which are part of education. I mean, they're always being squeezed out by the senses

32:08.340 --> 32:17.340
on more science, more literacy, more language, more learning. I think training other skills

32:17.340 --> 32:24.340
like intuitive abilities and emotional intelligence, all these things, they seem to be really important.

32:24.340 --> 32:30.340
But we've got a system of education which is designed for, well, basically it follows

32:30.340 --> 32:37.340
from Victorian design, doesn't it, of preparing people for life in an industrial society.

32:37.340 --> 32:42.340
One thing is to make children used to getting up and showing up for school at nine o'clock

32:42.340 --> 32:47.340
in the morning and fixed hours, I mean, which you need in an industrial society,

32:47.340 --> 32:53.340
disciplining from an early age. And I think a lot of it's about that.

32:53.340 --> 32:55.340
I think that's very important myself.

32:55.340 --> 33:00.340
It's important, but it's not primarily about creativity.

33:00.340 --> 33:02.340
Obviously so.

33:02.340 --> 33:09.340
Actually, for most people, I don't think creativity is, I don't think we necessarily need to have creativity

33:09.340 --> 33:14.340
built into the entire educational system because it's a major disadvantage.

33:14.340 --> 33:19.340
It's a disadvantage for a lot of people to be creative. I mean, if you've got a regular job

33:19.340 --> 33:25.340
and you're creative, you're going to have an awfully difficult time.

33:25.340 --> 33:28.340
Most jobs require lack of creativity.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.340
Yes.

33:30.340 --> 33:37.340
And, you know, I went into the scientific career believing that the importance of scientists

33:37.340 --> 33:44.340
be original and creative. And I soon discovered there was every obstacle to doing that.

33:44.340 --> 33:55.340
You know, whenever I'm trying to be or am being or, you know, doing something that seems to me original and creative,

33:55.340 --> 34:00.340
instead of people saying how wonderful, I mean, the vast majority of people say rubbish, nonsense,

34:00.340 --> 34:06.340
where's the evidence, etc. And if you have the evidence and you do an experiment you think is creative,

34:06.340 --> 34:10.340
you say, well, you've got these results, but where's the theory?

34:10.340 --> 34:22.340
You know, and as Alex sometimes says, you know, one of the responses I get to my research on telepathy

34:22.340 --> 34:27.340
and things like that is, you know, it's all very well in practice, but does it work in theory?

34:27.340 --> 34:29.340
Yes, it does.

34:29.340 --> 34:34.340
So actually originality is a major disadvantage for a lot of people.

34:34.340 --> 34:38.340
Well, it may be, but it depends what we mean by an education.

34:38.340 --> 34:44.340
If we mean simply preparing people for routine jobs, then we're limiting their potential

34:44.340 --> 34:49.340
and we're prescribing what is valued in society.

34:49.340 --> 34:56.340
Whereas if we were to encourage some people, definitely need their originality enhancing

34:56.340 --> 35:00.340
or not even enhancing but liberating, I think it's there in a lot of people.

35:00.340 --> 35:05.340
But it does need disciplining as well. This is why I see that both parts are important.

35:05.340 --> 35:11.340
I think that modern education both lacks discipline and lacks originality.

35:11.340 --> 35:17.340
It's about sticking information into people inefficiently and then hoping they can regurgitate it later.

35:17.340 --> 35:19.340
But that's not an education at all.

35:19.340 --> 35:24.340
An education is about enabling something that is innate to grow.

35:24.340 --> 35:30.340
But that growth also, if you like, needs a formal field in which to grow.

35:30.340 --> 35:36.340
And that should be provided by good teachers and was, I hope for you and certainly was for me,

35:36.340 --> 35:45.340
by highly disciplined, intellectually acute, but also imaginatively inspired teachers from whom I learned.

35:45.340 --> 35:47.340
You know, this was extraordinarily important.

35:47.340 --> 35:52.340
Now, I was very lucky too with my teachers at school and at university.

35:52.340 --> 35:56.340
But I mean, what I want to emphasize is it's not about letting it all hang out.

35:56.340 --> 35:59.340
I mean, there was an enormous amount of discipline.

35:59.340 --> 36:03.340
You know, at an early age, one had to know trigonometry and calculus.

36:03.340 --> 36:06.340
One had to be able to understand Greek grammar and Latin grammar, all these things.

36:06.340 --> 36:08.340
And these are difficult.

36:08.340 --> 36:12.340
I mean, there are all things that you get by sort of going, oh, well, whatever.

36:12.340 --> 36:15.340
I mean, they really require serious application.

36:15.340 --> 36:18.340
And one does need that structure.

36:18.340 --> 36:23.340
And I believe that in learning a skill, and you talked about that,

36:23.340 --> 36:25.340
and you're talking about manual skills largely.

36:25.340 --> 36:27.340
I think they're very important crafts and skills.

36:27.340 --> 36:31.340
But to begin with, you have to do rather laborious copying of things.

36:31.340 --> 36:36.340
But then you're in the position to be able to go further than that.

36:36.340 --> 36:39.340
But you need that first element to be there before you can go further.

36:39.340 --> 36:44.340
I mean, I didn't write this book out of not knowing anything about neuroscience or, you know,

36:44.340 --> 36:47.340
years of hard work involved.

36:47.340 --> 36:50.340
And your work, it also involves years of hard work, I know.

36:50.340 --> 36:53.340
It's that commute from right to left to right that you mentioned, right?

36:53.340 --> 36:56.340
Yes, it needs to go from right to left and back to right.

36:56.340 --> 37:03.340
By which I mean that one's first apprehension of something is a perceptive and imaginative understanding.

37:03.340 --> 37:07.340
And then one needs to, as we learn more, by the process of analysis

37:07.340 --> 37:10.340
and seeing the structure of what one's doing

37:10.340 --> 37:13.340
and making comparisons and putting things together in a certain way.

37:13.340 --> 37:15.340
But they must never stop there.

37:15.340 --> 37:17.340
That is an intermediary phase.

37:17.340 --> 37:25.340
And then it needs to be reintegrated into a new whole in which that laborious analysis has been not lost

37:25.340 --> 37:30.340
because that suggests that it was pointless, but it had its point at a certain period in time.

37:30.340 --> 37:34.340
What your discussion reminds me of the simple organisms I used to study,

37:34.340 --> 37:36.340
E. coli, how they navigate the world.

37:36.340 --> 37:39.340
It's like learning to tumble and learning to run.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.340
They need to run and tumble.

37:41.340 --> 37:46.340
So in a way, a certain dose of dogmatism is needed to just keep on going for some while

37:46.340 --> 37:48.340
because it would stop at every point.

37:48.340 --> 37:50.340
To reconceive that you would get nowhere.

37:50.340 --> 37:53.340
But if you don't stop and tumble, then you also go nowhere.

37:53.340 --> 37:55.340
So it's this balance in a way.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.340
It's very interesting.

37:57.340 --> 38:04.340
And of course science needs to balance its openness to change and newness

38:04.340 --> 38:09.340
and its willingness to stick to certain things unless there's a good reason for moving on.

38:09.340 --> 38:12.340
Otherwise it would be changing its mind about everything all the time.

38:12.340 --> 38:17.340
So everything in life is a matter of balancing things

38:17.340 --> 38:23.340
and coming to a position which honours and respects and enhances by integrating

38:23.340 --> 38:27.340
the two things that we think are separate in some way, but they're not really separate.

38:27.340 --> 38:29.340
I agree.

38:29.340 --> 38:33.340
Now let's not make of your particular biographies as a friend of mine says,

38:33.340 --> 38:38.340
a universal category, but I'd like to hear a bit about your own paths

38:38.340 --> 38:45.340
because it's clear that you've gone through the margins or the edge.

38:45.340 --> 38:46.340
You could even say cutting edge.

38:46.340 --> 38:48.340
You haven't followed the prescribed path.

38:48.340 --> 38:52.340
At your risk, you've succeeded.

38:52.340 --> 38:55.340
That's why maybe we don't have your other people who didn't make it,

38:55.340 --> 38:59.340
but you've made it and in a way your paths are similar in that respect.

38:59.340 --> 39:06.340
And what does that tell us as a model or what it doesn't tell us as a model for other people?

39:06.340 --> 39:10.340
Well, I suppose we're both feral academics

39:10.340 --> 39:15.340
and we were both fellows of colleges in Oxford, me at Cambridge

39:15.340 --> 39:23.340
and we somehow escaped from domestication and lived in the wild.

39:23.340 --> 39:25.340
As much in the wild as you.

39:25.340 --> 39:31.340
I mean, you were treated to the fastnesses of the Western Isles.

39:31.340 --> 39:35.340
I'm merely on the edge of Hampstead Heath.

39:37.340 --> 39:41.340
But I find, I don't know if you do, that very often now,

39:41.340 --> 39:44.340
and I didn't think this was always the case, but very often now,

39:44.340 --> 39:52.340
the really interesting ideas are coming forth from places that are not in the middle of the mainstream.

39:52.340 --> 39:57.340
They're coming from people who are working on their own or working in small groups

39:57.340 --> 40:02.340
and these are producing highly interesting and imaginative propositions

40:02.340 --> 40:07.340
whereas in the mainstream there's far too much emphasis on not stepping out of line,

40:07.340 --> 40:12.340
not rocking the boat, and if you say something that isn't what your colleagues are saying,

40:12.340 --> 40:16.340
then you won't get promoted, you won't get a grant and all the rest.

40:16.340 --> 40:18.340
So it must be deadening actually living like that

40:18.340 --> 40:22.340
and I'm just not prepared to live like that and I don't expect you to be a writer.

40:22.340 --> 40:26.340
No, no, but it does.

40:26.340 --> 40:30.340
I mean, it's not a career path one can recommend to other people

40:30.340 --> 40:36.340
because it's not very easy to survive outside the framework of regular salaries.

40:36.340 --> 40:42.340
Alex is a uniquely privileged being Spanish in a way that we can't be being British

40:42.340 --> 40:47.340
because being a scientist in Spain is to be part of the civil service

40:47.340 --> 40:51.340
and once you've got tenure as he has, then you've got it for life

40:51.340 --> 40:54.340
and so he can do what he likes.

40:54.340 --> 40:58.340
So he's in a uniquely privileged position of having an actual salary

40:58.340 --> 41:02.340
which neither of you or I have had for a very long time

41:02.340 --> 41:07.340
and the freedom to be inquiring into all these things

41:07.340 --> 41:12.340
and talking to you and me and investigating all sorts of areas of science

41:12.340 --> 41:14.340
with a remarkable freedom.

41:14.340 --> 41:16.340
Two caveats here.

41:16.340 --> 41:20.340
One is once you've got tenure, that's one caveat

41:20.340 --> 41:23.340
and what has happened to those who didn't get it

41:23.340 --> 41:26.340
and were perhaps more valuable

41:26.340 --> 41:31.340
and also those who got it, how the whole process has shaped their minds, that's one thing

41:31.340 --> 41:35.340
and the second paradox is I have many colleagues who got tenure

41:35.340 --> 41:40.340
but they continue, I mean, probably some of them may want to continue doing what they're doing

41:40.340 --> 41:44.340
but even having tenure, like some people say, I'll wait until I retire

41:44.340 --> 41:47.340
and then I'll write that book or that idea

41:47.340 --> 41:51.340
and perhaps that's also a good idea to do it later but maybe it's too late.

41:51.340 --> 41:53.340
Maybe it's too late often, I think.

41:53.340 --> 41:58.340
One you need to get to tenure and even if you get there, it's no guarantee for anything of that.

41:58.340 --> 42:01.340
No, it doesn't guarantee people or take you seriously.

42:01.340 --> 42:06.340
I mean, I used to think that people who got the Nobel Prize

42:06.340 --> 42:10.340
would have enough confidence to do and say what they think and would be taken seriously

42:10.340 --> 42:13.340
but actually even the Nobel Prize is no guarantee.

42:13.340 --> 42:16.340
Brian Josephson, for example, at Cambridge,

42:16.340 --> 42:21.340
well, as soon as he got interest in psychic phenomena and the nature of consciousness

42:22.340 --> 42:27.340
although he's a professor with tenure, as a Nobel laureate, a fellow of Trinity College,

42:27.340 --> 42:34.340
his colleagues make sure he doesn't get students and that he's marginalized, etc.

42:34.340 --> 42:39.340
because his views are untenable in their eyes.

42:39.340 --> 42:47.340
So even the Nobel Prize and tenure, it may guarantee a certain freedom of manoeuvre

42:47.340 --> 42:52.340
but it doesn't guarantee that what one does will have much influence.

42:52.340 --> 42:56.340
The influence is perhaps another matter but I haven't found that, I mean,

42:56.340 --> 43:00.340
largely being in the mainstream race of my life has impeded me.

43:00.340 --> 43:03.340
I mean, because I was, you know, I was a fellow of Oxford College

43:03.340 --> 43:10.340
and I became a psychiatrist and director at the Bethelman Morsley Hospital in London

43:10.340 --> 43:13.340
which is of all the institutions of mental health,

43:13.340 --> 43:17.340
one of the most, you know, central in the world.

43:17.340 --> 43:26.340
And I was salaried but of course there was freedom to use what one saw and think in another way

43:26.340 --> 43:28.340
and I think it's open to more people than one thinks.

43:28.340 --> 43:31.340
They don't have to go out completely on a limb

43:31.340 --> 43:36.340
but if you look at what you experience and think about it in a deeper, broader context,

43:36.340 --> 43:38.340
you see something different.

43:38.340 --> 43:43.340
And I just think that an awful lot of people see what they're doing in science

43:43.340 --> 43:49.340
as sort of self-evident and not raising further questions.

43:49.340 --> 43:53.340
It's a rather unusual kind of mind that asks the question,

43:53.340 --> 43:56.340
so why does it actually do that? Why does it work like that?

43:56.340 --> 44:05.340
And I have found one of the best books on this topic is Erwin Chargaff's

44:05.340 --> 44:08.340
autobiography, Heraklite and Fire.

44:08.340 --> 44:13.340
You know, he was a very great, honoured biochemist at Yale

44:13.340 --> 44:20.340
who laid the groundwork for Crick and Watson and so on, the author of Chargaff's Rules,

44:20.340 --> 44:27.340
but he writes brilliantly and with enormous imagination about what he sees science to be

44:27.340 --> 44:36.340
and he contrasts it with this extremely deadening, simple following out of linear paths.

44:36.340 --> 44:40.340
I think it's partly a result of the massive expansion and professionalisation of science.

44:40.340 --> 44:41.340
Exactly.

44:41.340 --> 44:45.340
I mean, so he would say in World War, it becomes a career path.

44:45.340 --> 44:49.340
It was a struggle. In the 19th century a lot of scientists in Britain

44:49.340 --> 44:54.340
were either amateurs like Charles Darwin who never had an academic job.

44:54.340 --> 44:59.340
Faraday was at the Royal Institution, not in the university,

44:59.340 --> 45:03.340
in a rather eccentric small institution.

45:03.340 --> 45:10.340
But when it became professionalised, something that T. H. Huxley was one of the drivers of in Britain,

45:10.340 --> 45:15.340
to make science a professional, like a priesthood,

45:15.340 --> 45:19.340
where only people who got the right degrees and qualifications could teach it

45:19.340 --> 45:22.340
and influence people through universities.

45:22.340 --> 45:27.340
The school system and what was taught in schools and all that was professionalised.

45:27.340 --> 45:29.340
And then you've got to have the right qualifications.

45:29.340 --> 45:34.340
His aim was to squeeze out country vicos who did wonderful natural history,

45:34.340 --> 45:36.340
who believed in God.

45:36.340 --> 45:39.340
He thought no one in science should believe in God, or if they did,

45:39.340 --> 45:43.340
it should be kept at least very much their private life.

45:43.340 --> 45:45.340
You've got to have two priestshoods.

45:45.340 --> 45:52.340
That's right. You have one priesthood and then this model of scientists as priests

45:52.340 --> 45:55.340
then spread to the Soviet Union.

45:55.340 --> 45:59.340
Scientists were the highest rank of the intellectuals and all that kind of thing.

45:59.340 --> 46:02.340
And so it became all over the world.

46:02.340 --> 46:08.340
In countries like India and China, engineers and scientists are very, very high prestige.

46:08.340 --> 46:14.340
They're not terribly high prestige in Britain because they're regarded as boffins and geeks and things.

46:15.340 --> 46:19.340
The highest prestige goes to people who've been to Eaton and Oxford

46:19.340 --> 46:24.340
and who belong to the Bollinger Club and become conservative prime ministers,

46:24.340 --> 46:26.340
at least for a while.

46:26.340 --> 46:32.340
So they don't know that the person you're referring to currently enjoys great esteem in the country.

46:32.340 --> 46:35.340
No, no. It's only temporary.

46:35.340 --> 46:38.340
It shows these things are always temporary.

46:38.340 --> 46:43.340
But still, the point is that in Britain, scientists have never commanded,

46:43.340 --> 46:47.340
Newton's being venerated and Darwin's being venerated and so on,

46:47.340 --> 46:54.340
but it's never been like there's quite the priesthood level that it achieves in many other countries.

46:54.340 --> 46:58.340
But nevertheless, it's the idea is of a kind of priesthood.

46:58.340 --> 47:03.340
And then you've got all the ranks of the sort of deacons and sub-deacons and stuff.

47:03.340 --> 47:06.340
It becomes a whole professional thing. Then it becomes a career.

47:06.340 --> 47:11.340
And when I lived in India, I worked with Indian scientists.

47:11.340 --> 47:15.340
I was an Indian International Scientific Institute.

47:15.340 --> 47:19.340
Most of my Indian scientific colleagues had not gone into science

47:19.340 --> 47:22.340
because of a deep curiosity about nature.

47:22.340 --> 47:25.340
They'd gone into it because their parents believed in education

47:25.340 --> 47:30.340
and science and medicine and engineering were the three top careers.

47:30.340 --> 47:34.340
And so any bright children had been pushed into that

47:34.340 --> 47:38.340
and pushed in their studies and pushed through the university.

47:38.340 --> 47:43.340
And then they got jobs in high prestige institutions if they worked hard enough.

47:43.340 --> 47:48.340
And their whole social status and the ability to marry off their daughters

47:48.340 --> 47:52.340
to more prestigious husbands in an arranged marriage system

47:52.340 --> 47:55.340
moved them up the social scale instead.

47:55.340 --> 47:58.340
It wasn't at all about curiosity for most of them.

47:58.340 --> 48:04.340
And I think for many scientists today here in Britain,

48:04.340 --> 48:08.340
it's not primarily about deep curiosity about nature.

48:08.340 --> 48:12.340
It's about being a functionary within a system.

48:12.340 --> 48:18.340
Well, as Whitehead said, this divorce between science and philosophy

48:18.340 --> 48:21.340
has been a congestion of both.

48:21.340 --> 48:27.340
And I think that science properly understood is a form of philosophy.

48:27.340 --> 48:33.340
It's an investigation of philosophy in certain particular empirical methods.

48:33.340 --> 48:37.340
But it has philosophical implications

48:37.340 --> 48:41.340
and it draws on philosophical principles that it's outset.

48:41.340 --> 48:43.340
You may not understand that it does that.

48:43.340 --> 48:46.340
But that's more dangerous when people don't realize what it is they're doing.

48:46.340 --> 48:48.340
They don't do it well.

48:48.340 --> 48:51.340
But I think that we need to get back to the understanding

48:51.340 --> 48:54.340
that science has philosophical meaning

48:54.340 --> 48:56.340
and that this is not enough discussed.

48:56.340 --> 48:59.340
If one needs philosophically minded scientists

48:59.340 --> 49:02.340
and scientifically minded philosophers,

49:02.340 --> 49:05.340
philosophers who are willing to spend time

49:05.340 --> 49:09.340
learning about the science that will give them insights

49:09.340 --> 49:11.340
into the forming of their philosophy.

49:11.340 --> 49:15.340
Well, I mean, here in Britain the word science wasn't introduced

49:15.340 --> 49:17.340
until the 19th century.

49:17.340 --> 49:20.340
And before that it was called natural philosophy.

49:20.340 --> 49:24.340
And Newton's great book, Principia Mathematica,

49:24.340 --> 49:28.340
the mathematical principles of natural philosophy.

49:29.340 --> 49:32.340
So I think that natural philosophy

49:32.340 --> 49:35.340
is actually a really good word and for it.

49:35.340 --> 49:39.340
I'm a member of the main Cambridge University Scientific Society

49:39.340 --> 49:42.340
which is called the Cambridge Philosophical Society.

49:42.340 --> 49:47.340
Because when it was started in the early 19th century

49:47.340 --> 49:51.340
it was called natural philosophy as Cambridge.

49:51.340 --> 49:55.340
I subscribed to biological reviews

49:55.340 --> 49:58.340
which was on the main review journals in biology,

49:58.340 --> 50:01.340
the subtitles of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.

50:01.340 --> 50:05.340
So I think natural philosophy is what you are.

50:05.340 --> 50:08.340
I like to think it's what I and Alex are too.

50:08.340 --> 50:11.340
And I think that probably most people who listen to us

50:11.340 --> 50:13.340
are natural philosophers.

50:13.340 --> 50:18.340
And so in a sense it's a matter of recovering

50:18.340 --> 50:22.340
what was the root of what we now call science.

50:22.340 --> 50:27.340
Before it was hijacked by this professionalization movement

50:27.340 --> 50:30.340
and this creation of this priesthood

50:30.340 --> 50:35.340
and making it an exclusive professional organization

50:35.340 --> 50:38.340
that you have to obey the rules of.

50:38.340 --> 50:41.340
One of the things I feel about the age we live in

50:41.340 --> 50:45.340
is the predominance of the administrative or bureaucratic mind

50:45.340 --> 50:48.340
over almost every aspect of our lives.

50:48.340 --> 50:51.340
And I think this is deeply damaging

50:51.340 --> 50:54.340
and I think it's an exhibition of the left hemisphere's way

50:54.340 --> 50:58.340
of both trying to understand

50:58.340 --> 51:00.340
but misunderstanding what it's dealing with

51:00.340 --> 51:02.340
and above all to control it.

51:02.340 --> 51:05.340
And I think that what has happened is that

51:05.340 --> 51:08.340
yes, I understand the analogy with the church

51:08.340 --> 51:11.340
but what has really happened is that something much less glamorous

51:11.340 --> 51:13.340
has happened in science

51:13.340 --> 51:17.340
which is simply that it's become a huge bureaucracy.

51:17.340 --> 51:22.340
It has money to spend

51:22.340 --> 51:27.340
which follows people who tow the party line

51:27.340 --> 51:29.340
do more of what everyone else is doing

51:29.340 --> 51:35.340
and it's very difficult in this sclerotic hierarchy

51:35.340 --> 51:40.340
as it would be in the middle of an enormous Byzantine civil service

51:40.340 --> 51:44.340
to be able to break out and see something else or do something else.

51:44.340 --> 51:47.340
So I think the future will depend on the development

51:47.340 --> 51:51.340
of small private colleges where people are very much

51:51.340 --> 51:54.340
you take in only the brightest people.

51:54.340 --> 51:56.340
I think that's very important.

51:56.340 --> 51:59.340
We're sort of worried by the concept of elitism

51:59.340 --> 52:01.340
but looked at another way.

52:01.340 --> 52:05.340
Education depends on and our future depends on

52:05.340 --> 52:08.340
people who have the capacity to think clearly

52:08.340 --> 52:11.340
and to think imaginatively being encouraged

52:11.340 --> 52:15.340
and that's what a good college should be doing in my view.

52:15.340 --> 52:19.340
And so I think it's from those small institutions

52:19.340 --> 52:21.340
which are beginning to spring up in competition

52:21.340 --> 52:24.340
with the great universities

52:24.340 --> 52:27.340
that the future will flourish.

52:27.340 --> 52:29.340
And I'm sorry about that

52:29.340 --> 52:32.340
because I have a great allegiance

52:32.340 --> 52:37.340
for the enormously interesting and valuable history

52:37.340 --> 52:39.340
of our great institutions.

52:39.340 --> 52:41.340
I'm very sorry to say this

52:41.340 --> 52:43.340
but they're beginning to turn themselves into something

52:43.340 --> 52:45.340
that can be easily dispensed with.

52:45.340 --> 52:48.340
How to prevent those institutions from following the same path

52:48.340 --> 52:52.340
and also how to solve the accreditation problem there?

52:52.340 --> 52:56.340
Because in a way that I wanted to ask you both this very question

52:56.340 --> 53:00.340
like you have navigated outside the institutional seas

53:00.340 --> 53:03.340
but nevertheless there's some appreciation for institutions

53:03.340 --> 53:05.340
still in both of you.

53:05.340 --> 53:07.340
Very much so, yes.

53:07.340 --> 53:11.340
How much of it can we still embrace

53:11.340 --> 53:14.340
and how much we need to just reject?

53:14.340 --> 53:19.340
So back to the future, these future scientists and philosophers

53:19.340 --> 53:21.340
are they going to be in institutions

53:21.340 --> 53:24.340
and if they're not, how is the new order

53:24.340 --> 53:26.340
or the new business going to be

53:26.340 --> 53:30.340
in terms of accreditation and so on?

53:30.340 --> 53:34.340
It's like designing a new Atlantis

53:34.340 --> 53:37.340
you know, what's the new new Atlantis?

53:37.340 --> 53:40.340
Four hundred years later.

53:40.340 --> 53:43.340
Well I don't have a crystal ball, I don't know

53:43.340 --> 53:47.340
but I think that what you say in the sense

53:47.340 --> 53:49.340
that there needs to be an institution

53:49.340 --> 53:52.340
but it may not be these institutions I think is right.

53:52.340 --> 53:54.340
I mean everything evolves

53:54.340 --> 53:57.340
and evolution is partly that things have their proper period

53:57.340 --> 54:01.340
and the great universities, Oxford and Cambridge for example

54:01.340 --> 54:03.340
have a thousand year history

54:03.340 --> 54:05.340
they're currently committing suicide in my view

54:05.340 --> 54:08.340
by not sticking to their guns

54:08.340 --> 54:13.340
and so this means that other institutions will spring up

54:13.340 --> 54:18.340
because there's a natural need to nourish those

54:18.340 --> 54:24.340
who will benefit from being given freedom and discipline together

54:24.340 --> 54:27.340
and the time to fulfill these things.

54:27.340 --> 54:30.340
Let me tell you something about my own experience

54:30.340 --> 54:35.340
which will sound horribly, you know, I don't know, unusual

54:35.340 --> 54:40.340
but I got this fellowship at 21 of all souls

54:40.340 --> 54:46.340
and I was to embark on a doctorate on 18th century English literature

54:46.340 --> 54:49.340
and this fellowship was a seven year fellowship

54:49.340 --> 54:51.340
after examination there's this strange thing

54:51.340 --> 54:53.340
that doesn't have any equivalent to Cambridge

54:53.340 --> 54:55.340
or anywhere else in Oxford

54:55.340 --> 54:57.340
of a college that consists only of fellows

54:57.340 --> 55:00.340
not of any students, graduate or otherwise

55:00.340 --> 55:02.340
and when you become a fellow after examination

55:02.340 --> 55:04.340
which is a three day examination

55:04.340 --> 55:07.340
if you become one you get seven years

55:07.340 --> 55:11.340
in which to do whatever it is that interests you intellectually

55:11.340 --> 55:16.340
and Derek Parfit, a very well-known philosopher

55:16.340 --> 55:19.340
said to me, don't do your doctorate

55:19.340 --> 55:23.340
anybody can do a doctorate, that's part of the sort of machinery

55:23.340 --> 55:26.340
but you've been given something completely extraordinary

55:26.340 --> 55:29.340
which is seven years in which you can pursue ideas

55:29.340 --> 55:32.340
and I thought he was absolutely right

55:32.340 --> 55:36.340
and at the time I followed all kinds of interests

55:36.340 --> 55:40.340
in science, in other languages, in literature, in philosophy

55:40.340 --> 55:45.340
and at the time I thought, you know, this is wonderful

55:45.340 --> 55:48.340
but I didn't realise until much later in my life

55:48.340 --> 55:50.340
why it had been so important

55:50.340 --> 55:53.340
and I'm not sure that even, I don't know enough

55:53.340 --> 55:55.340
I mustn't speak about what I'm not certain of

55:55.340 --> 55:58.340
but I think that the ethos of all souls is rather changed

55:58.340 --> 56:00.340
as everything does

56:00.340 --> 56:04.340
and there's more of that, you know, we must keep an eye on what he's reading

56:04.340 --> 56:06.340
and has he published a paper and all that

56:06.340 --> 56:08.340
but I was free of that

56:08.340 --> 56:11.340
and later in life I thought, well what did I make of that?

56:11.340 --> 56:14.340
and to me the answer came with the publication of these books

56:14.340 --> 56:16.340
because I couldn't possibly have written them

56:16.340 --> 56:20.340
unless I'd been allowed to range wild, as you should say

56:20.340 --> 56:23.340
but I did it within an institution

56:23.340 --> 56:27.340
over the fields of things from which I drew

56:27.340 --> 56:32.340
the bigger picture I've tried to express in these books

56:32.340 --> 56:35.340
which can only be done if you've had the ability to range

56:35.340 --> 56:38.340
so this business of range

56:38.340 --> 56:42.340
which is exactly the opposite of the tendency towards ever greater specialism

56:42.340 --> 56:44.340
is very, very important

56:44.340 --> 56:47.340
and I think that more institutions ought to

56:47.340 --> 56:50.340
follow what happened in the 60s

56:50.340 --> 56:56.340
which was, you know, institutions used to take people

56:56.340 --> 56:59.340
that had proved themselves to be intelligent

56:59.340 --> 57:01.340
and give them carte blanche

57:01.340 --> 57:05.340
and they gave them an office, gave them an income for a few years

57:05.340 --> 57:09.340
and then said, follow your instincts, you know, what you find interesting

57:09.340 --> 57:12.340
and out of that came many, many inventions

57:12.340 --> 57:17.340
Well I had a very similar period of freedom to you

57:17.340 --> 57:20.340
and actually I feel enormously grateful for it

57:20.340 --> 57:23.340
and I had two periods of freedom

57:23.340 --> 57:26.340
First of all, when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge

57:26.340 --> 57:29.340
I became increasingly disenchanted with mechanistic science

57:29.340 --> 57:31.340
which I was studying

57:31.340 --> 57:35.340
I started reading Goethe and I had the idea of a holistic science

57:35.340 --> 57:39.340
and everyone assumed I'd go on and do a PhD

57:39.340 --> 57:41.340
because I got a double first

57:41.340 --> 57:45.340
but I wasn't sure if I wanted to

57:45.340 --> 57:49.340
I mean I liked science but I didn't like killing animals all the time

57:49.340 --> 57:52.340
and I didn't like treating them as machines

57:52.340 --> 57:55.340
and the whole attitude of mechanistic science

57:55.340 --> 57:59.340
so I found there was this fellowship at Harvard

57:59.340 --> 58:02.340
that was open to people from Cambridge for a year

58:02.340 --> 58:05.340
in the graduate school, I applied for it and I got it

58:05.340 --> 58:08.340
and when I got to Harvard to do history and philosophy of science

58:08.340 --> 58:12.340
to step back to see the bigger picture, that's what I wanted to do

58:13.340 --> 58:17.340
I found that they treat graduate students at Harvard

58:17.340 --> 58:21.340
in a way I hadn't been treated since I was about 15

58:21.340 --> 58:24.340
read these pages this week, read those and we'll test you

58:24.340 --> 58:26.340
to make sure you've read it

58:26.340 --> 58:28.340
it was spoon feeding, there was no freedom

58:28.340 --> 58:30.340
I tried doing what they said

58:30.340 --> 58:32.340
and after about a month

58:32.340 --> 58:35.340
I just couldn't do it, I mean you'd have to stay up till midnight

58:35.340 --> 58:37.340
every night to read all this stuff and they'd test you

58:37.340 --> 58:40.340
there was no time to read anything else

58:40.340 --> 58:42.340
to study anything else that interested you

58:42.340 --> 58:44.340
it was completely on their own track

58:44.340 --> 58:47.340
so I went to see the professor of history of science

58:47.340 --> 58:49.340
who was in charge of me and I said

58:49.340 --> 58:51.340
look, I love being here at Harvard

58:51.340 --> 58:53.340
and I'm really interested in these subjects

58:53.340 --> 58:56.340
this isn't the way I learn and this isn't the way I work

58:56.340 --> 58:59.340
I don't really need a master's degree from Harvard

58:59.340 --> 59:02.340
because I can buy one from Cambridge for 75 pounds

59:02.340 --> 59:08.340
and in those days

59:08.340 --> 59:12.340
all you had to do was stay alive for three and a third years

59:12.340 --> 59:15.340
and pay five pounds and you've got a master's degree

59:15.340 --> 59:17.340
if you've got a bachelor's, same as Oxford

59:17.340 --> 59:18.340
same as Oxford, yes

59:18.340 --> 59:20.340
so presumably you bought yours too

59:20.340 --> 59:21.340
or maybe you didn't bother

59:21.340 --> 59:23.340
yes, it came to me automatically

59:23.340 --> 59:24.340
I don't think I had to pay

59:24.340 --> 59:26.340
oh yes, I had to pay five pounds

59:26.340 --> 59:28.340
so I said to the professor

59:28.340 --> 59:30.340
I just don't need your master's degree

59:31.340 --> 59:33.340
and he said are you sure

59:33.340 --> 59:35.340
and he said there's a Harvard master's degree

59:35.340 --> 59:36.340
and I said well I'm quite sure

59:36.340 --> 59:38.340
I'll get a Cambridge one

59:38.340 --> 59:40.340
and I said is there any way out

59:40.340 --> 59:42.340
and just be here for a year

59:42.340 --> 59:44.340
and be part of the university

59:44.340 --> 59:46.340
and not do all these exams

59:46.340 --> 59:48.340
and tests and things

59:48.340 --> 59:50.340
I said I think that would be much more useful

59:50.340 --> 59:52.340
and valuable for me

59:52.340 --> 59:54.340
he said well actually we do have a rarely used

59:54.340 --> 59:56.340
provision called special students

59:56.340 --> 59:58.340
and he said

59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.340
and I said well can you make me one

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.340
and he said well I'd have to talk to

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.340
the committee and stuff

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.340
so anyway

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.340
I got him to register

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.340
they agreed

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.340
and I was registered as a special student

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.340
so I was there in the graduate school at Harvard

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.340
I was doing a bit of teaching

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.340
to earn a bit of money in the natural sciences program

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:17.340
in biology labs

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.340
in biology 101

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.340
I was teaching lab classes

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:24.340
but otherwise, apart from my obligation to do that

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.340
I had complete freedom

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:28.340
I went to lectures in history of art

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.340
and philosophy

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.340
and classics

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.340
in history

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.340
I had the entire

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.340
I got the university catalogue

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.340
and I went through the list of lectures every week

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.340
and I did a lot of philosophy

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.340
in history of science

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.340
but I had an entire university

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.340
at my disposal

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.340
and whenever I was doing exams

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.340
I just caught the train to New York

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.340
and had fun in New York

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.340
for a few days

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.340
and it was the most blissful way of being at a university

01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.340
and then later

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.340
when I got my fellowship at Clare College

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.340
in Cambridge

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.340
it started as a research fellowship

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.340
and it was

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.340
I had a six year research fellowship

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.340
where

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.340
my teaching load was limited

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.340
to six hours a week of

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:17.340
tutorials and since

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.340
in Cambridge, like Oxford, the vacations

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.340
last six and a half months a year

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.340
this is only six hours a week

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.340
for five and a half months a year

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.340
and actually less than that

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.340
because half a month is exams

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.340
it was not exactly an onerous teaching burden

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.340
it was the nicest form of teaching

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.340
to students at a time

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.340
informally in tutorials

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.340
and the rest of the time

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:41.340
I was completely free

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.340
I don't think I even read annual reports

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.340
then I got a research fellowship

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.340
from the Ross site

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.340
and I did have to write a one page annual report

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:51.340
but I was completely free

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.340
and quite into it

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.340
when I said to the college

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.340
I just got this

01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.340
thing from the Ross site

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.340
a tropical research grant

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.340
and I'm going off to the University of Malaya

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:05.340
for a year to study rainforest plants

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.340
and travelling through India on the way

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:09.340
they said

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.340
well fine

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.340
it was an incredible

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.340
period for me

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.340
laid the foundation for everything I've done since

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.340
so like you

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:21.340
given an extraordinary freedom

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.340
within an institutional framework

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.340
which was

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.340
vastly valuable

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.340
now very very few people have that opportunity

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.340
absolutely

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:33.340
and you know what I want to emphasise

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.340
is I

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.340
like you I think it's very important

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.340
like you I feel very grateful for having been given it

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.340
my worry is that it won't be

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.340
given in the future to many people

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.340
but I think it's important

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.340
we live in an era

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.340
of micro-management

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.340
and I think micro-management produces only mediocrity

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:53.340
if you're constantly controlling

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.340
and dictating what people

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.340
read and think you'll only get

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.340
mediocrity

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.340
and if you give people a degree of freedom

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:03.340
okay there's a risk that they will abuse it

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.340
and they won't come up with something

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.340
but it's a much smaller risk

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:09.340
than the risk of micro-managing them

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.340
which ensures that they will never come up with anything interesting

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:13.340
so you actually have to

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.340
in a way trust

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.340
you have time to people

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.340
to explore things

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.340
that are of interest to them

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.340
otherwise it's the death of the life of the mind

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.340
it's for this reason that so many

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.340
as we both know

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.340
in the past so much of the science of the 18th

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:31.340
and 19th century

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.340
and even into the 20th century

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.340
comes from the work

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.340
of priests

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.340
of vickers of monks

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:41.340
I mean Mendel was a monk

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.340
they weren't part of any particular mainstream

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.340
but they had the security of a place

01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:47.340
and they were allowed to think

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:49.340
and observe and ask

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.340
interesting questions why do people

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.340
work in this way

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.340
well I think one simple way

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.340
this could be achieved at the strike of a pen

01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:59.340
is simply changing

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.340
the name of unemployment benefit

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.340
to research grants

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.340
so then we could have lots

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.340
of people on research grants

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:15.340
and the stigma of being on unemployment

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:17.340
would be transformed

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.340
at least for some people

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.340
yes very nice

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.340
because we after all have a lot of people

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.340
who are economically idle

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.340
as in we're in the classification of governments

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.340
who are actually being paid

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.340
by the state

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.340
and so much of that

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.340
could be repurposed

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.340
I mean mostly people are disempowered

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.340
by being unemployed

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.340
if this could be seen as a

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.340
positive thing

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.340
and also

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.340
another idea

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.340
it's only academics really that have sabbatical years

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.340
which is supposed to be

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.340
a year in which you can enjoy

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:55.340
the kind of freedom we're talking about

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:57.340
to be refreshed and so on

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.340
and

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:01.340
so

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:03.340
another scheme would be to make

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:05.340
sabbatical years optional for everybody

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.340
so when you're at 40

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:09.340
or 50 or 60

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:11.340
you could take an optional sabbatical year

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.340
and you'd take a cut

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:15.340
in income, you'd take leave from your regular job

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:17.340
and you'd get the unemployment

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.340
benefit which would now be

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.340
a redesignated research grant

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.340
or a sabbatical grant

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.340
it wouldn't cost the state anymore

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.340
because they're paying lots of people

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.340
not to work anyway

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:31.340
and by empowering people

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.340
who are not working in regular jobs

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.340
to think of themselves as doing

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.340
something different

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.340
it could be voluntary work

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.340
it could be natural history

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.340
it could be scientific research

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.340
there could be small grants

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.340
for people on sabbaticals

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.340
to set up experiments in their garages

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.340
and stuff

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.340
it could fuel a whole wealth of invention

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.340
throughout the population

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:57.340
I'm sure you were right

01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.340
almost no extra cost

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.340
and one thing I

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:03.340
know from experiences

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.340
a practical skill

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.340
that it has been enormously satisfying

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.340
probably more satisfying than almost anything else

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.340
and so

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.340
encouraging people not just to feel

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.340
demoralized and not have any goal

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.340
it might be better to allow people

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:21.340
to train

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:23.340
to develop a skill

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.340
which is a very life enhancing thing

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.340
and useful to society

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.340
there's not enough skilled labour

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.340
ones always looking for people who can do

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.340
this or that or the other

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.340
and maybe that should be part

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.340
of the scheme as well

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.340
there's already government schemes

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.340
for people in deprived areas

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:43.340
economically

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:45.340
for retraining

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.340
there's already retraining grants

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.340
I haven't looked into how they're administered

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.340
but I imagine that

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.340
if one got into the details

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:55.340
of existing bureaucracy

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.340
and existing grant structures

01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:59.340
some of it could be repurposed

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.340
in a way that's

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.340
along the lines you're suggesting

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.340
some of it's intended for that

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.340
so I think within the present system

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.340
there's probably quite a lot of potential

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.340
for revisioning

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.340
what people can learn and do

01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.340
so drawing things together

01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.340
perhaps there's a need

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.340
to break out of the straight jacket

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.340
of these people are unemployed

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.340
and therefore just waiting to get back into

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:29.340
this horrible machine

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.340
there's life outside the machine

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:33.340
there are other things that can be developed

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.340
for all of us depending on

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.340
what is both practical

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:39.340
for us and enjoyable

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.340
for us to develop

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.340
and it's about

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:45.340
abandoning this

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.340
micromanaging

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.340
administrative approach

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.340
to education

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.340
to science

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.340
and allowing people to develop the skills

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.340
that they have innately

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:59.340
in other words education should be a matter

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.340
of growing things

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:03.340
not inserting things

01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:05.340
and at the moment it's mainly about inserting things

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.340
but it's interesting

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.340
one of the things that's happening at the moment

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:11.340
is the so called skill shortage

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:13.340
or employment shortage

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.340
I read an article

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:17.340
just yesterday

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:19.340
the mystery of why

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:21.340
we have very low

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:23.340
unemployment at the moment

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.340
in Britain

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.340
and yet you can't get people to do jobs

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.340
but there's

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.340
large numbers of people who are economically inactive

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.340
and so

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:35.340
most people in Britain assume

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.340
the skills shortage or labour shortage

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.340
is because of Brexit

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:41.340
no

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.340
immigration from Europe

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:45.340
but

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.340
those are very similar when we were in Canada in the summer

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.340
they have the same situation there

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.340
in western Canada it's the same in the United States

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:53.340
what seems to have happened

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:55.340
is that a large number of people

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.340
have just voluntarily retired

01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.340
from the labour force

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.340
before retirement age

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.340
simply can't be bothered to have a job

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:05.340
and that must mean a drop in income

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.340
but there's millions of people

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.340
prepared to take that rather than carry on

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.340
well what that tells you is

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.340
that a lot of people's jobs are very unrewarding

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:15.340
and I think

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:17.340
what's really sad is that

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.340
jobs that are in the past

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.340
are obviously rewarding

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:23.340
like being a teacher or a doctor

01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.340
I think people are probably

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.340
not keen to, we know there's a shortage of doctors

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:29.340
there's a shortage of teachers

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.340
and I think that's partly to do with

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.340
the way again a management culture

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:35.340
has taken over

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:37.340
from a professional culture

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.340
and the individual is no longer

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:41.340
allowed to pursue interests

01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:43.340
and it's entirely

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.340
micromanaged like the Harvard thing

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:47.340
today you read these things

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.340
or you read those

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.340
so we need to stop this

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:53.340
and there was a wonderful moment

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.340
of creativity early on

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:57.340
in the Covid crisis

01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.340
when managers couldn't keep up with the situation

01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.340
and doctors said well

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.340
the hell with it we're going to do what we think will work

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.340
and lots of things were experimented with

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:07.340
and some of them were successful and some of them not

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:09.340
but this is a good situation

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:11.340
there's one in which doctors use their experience

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.340
are not told what to do

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.340
by a manager who has no experience

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.340
and in closing

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:19.340
it's not only important

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.340
we talk about it but again let me say

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:23.340
both of you are examples that this can be done

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:25.340
so I think it's useful

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.340
again to have the discussion

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:29.340
but to show that there are living examples

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.340
and it's not easy

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:33.340
but it can be done

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:35.340
and hopefully more people in the future

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.340
will be able to

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.340
we've been very fortunate

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:41.340
yes very fortunate

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.340
both within and outside

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.340
institutions

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.340
all right

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.340
thank you very much

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:51.340
well thank you Alex
