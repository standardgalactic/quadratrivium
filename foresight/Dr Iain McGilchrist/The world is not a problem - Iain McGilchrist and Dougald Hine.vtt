00:00.000 --> 00:17.760
Well Ian, it's great to be here with you on Sky and I suppose how I found my way here

00:17.760 --> 00:22.560
is that for years people have been telling me you must read The Master and his Emissary.

00:22.560 --> 00:28.400
Many people around Dark Mountain have been strongly influenced by it as a book and last

00:28.480 --> 00:34.240
autumn when I had just finished work on At Work in the Ruins I finally sat down with it

00:35.040 --> 00:45.600
and understood why because the question that I'm starting from in At Work in the Ruins is

00:46.880 --> 00:52.720
what's the nature of the trouble that the world is in, not least the part of that trouble that

00:52.800 --> 00:57.920
writes under the name of climate change and early in the book I say whenever we get into

00:57.920 --> 01:03.920
a conversation about climate change that conversation starts inevitably inside the frame of science

01:04.880 --> 01:10.160
because it's science that brings us the news and gives us ways of talking about it. Climate

01:10.160 --> 01:17.040
change is a scientific concept and yet I've been going around for years saying climate change asks

01:17.360 --> 01:25.120
questions that science cannot answer and the example of that that I have sent her on in the

01:25.120 --> 01:32.320
book is how did we find ourselves in this trouble? Is it the result of a piece of bad luck with the

01:32.320 --> 01:38.560
atmospheric chemistry that it turns out seven generations down the line that building industrial

01:38.560 --> 01:44.000
societies around all of these fossil fuels is throwing out of whack the climate system on

01:44.000 --> 01:49.440
which the conditions of possibility of human societies as we've known them have taken place?

01:49.440 --> 01:57.440
So is it bad luck or is it a consequence of a way of approaching the world, a way of seeing and

01:57.440 --> 02:05.360
treating everyone and everything that would anyway have brought us to such a pass even if

02:05.360 --> 02:10.800
the atmospheric chemistry had been different, had been less sensitive to all these carbon dioxide

02:10.800 --> 02:16.960
emissions and I feel like you've given one of the fullest accounts I've come across of that way

02:16.960 --> 02:27.360
of approaching the world. Yes well thank you I suppose when one talks about how we got here

02:27.360 --> 02:32.880
there are a number of different ways you can answer that question so it's not wrong of course to

02:33.680 --> 02:38.800
say that it's a problem to do with use of fossil fuels and so on but that itself

02:38.800 --> 02:43.520
is rooted in something bigger and beyond I believe which is as you say a whole

02:45.120 --> 02:52.720
conception of what we are what the planet is and how the two relate. So how do we begin to

02:52.720 --> 02:58.560
describe that or unpack that in a way that might help us ground the conversations that go on about

02:58.560 --> 03:04.880
climate change differently to the way they often seem to? Yes the difficulty is that there isn't

03:04.880 --> 03:12.560
a very easy way to say well if only you say this or do that it will work it's more a kind of way of

03:12.560 --> 03:20.880
being in the world that we need which we've lost but it can I think encouragingly be recovered and

03:20.880 --> 03:27.920
is you know I see and I'm sure you see this of course that there is a hunger for a way of

03:28.160 --> 03:34.960
thinking about ourselves and what we're doing here that is more sophisticated

03:35.680 --> 03:41.840
and more inclusive than the one that we've we've been taught and we've been sort of

03:43.040 --> 03:47.920
almost without realizing it we've been dragooned into a way of thinking that would have seemed

03:47.920 --> 03:55.120
extremely odd to our ancestors and to most people who are not brought up in the modern western

03:55.120 --> 04:03.040
tradition and it's a very modern thing even in the west I mean I would say perhaps only the last

04:04.080 --> 04:10.560
200 years at the maximum that we have adopted this very harshly reductionist

04:11.520 --> 04:16.960
strictly materialist way of thinking and I think that is at the bottom of what we've got wrong.

04:17.520 --> 04:24.160
And you've used that word modern several times there one of the one of the books that was in

04:24.160 --> 04:29.680
the field of possibility or created the field of possibility for what I've been writing is a book

04:29.680 --> 04:37.440
called Hospicing Modernity by Vanessa Machado de Oliveira who's a Brazilian scholar who's based

04:37.440 --> 04:45.040
in Canada and that image of what is called for in the kind of times we're in being neither to try

04:45.040 --> 04:51.840
and save modernity and make it somehow sustainable nor to try and overthrow it and bring it down or

04:51.840 --> 04:57.840
stage some kind of revolution but being to give it a good ending not least so that it can pass on

04:57.840 --> 05:03.840
the lessons that it has for us that may only be revealed in its in its ending and it feels like

05:03.840 --> 05:12.880
that is part of what this the the hunger or the longing that that you're describing that I think

05:12.880 --> 05:19.680
we both encounter. I like that idea very much because as you say the sort of overthrow he's

05:19.680 --> 05:26.000
always a bad idea to do something peremptory and abrupt but we haven't got a lot of time

05:26.000 --> 05:32.400
and we may not be able to as it were save modernity but as you say it's very important that whatever

05:32.400 --> 05:38.240
we leave is something that is viable and useful to whatever comes after us.

05:39.840 --> 05:44.880
After Paul and I wrote The Dark Mountain Manifesto I found myself increasingly getting invited into

05:44.880 --> 05:55.040
rooms where climate scientists were being brought together with artists and indigenous elders and

05:55.040 --> 06:01.120
people representing different kinds of knowledge or practice and it felt like the the invitation

06:01.120 --> 06:06.480
from the scientists on the one hand there was an assumption that we were going to somehow have a

06:06.480 --> 06:12.400
magic way to help deliver the message get people to listen to what the science was telling so we

06:12.400 --> 06:20.720
were being sort of enlisted as a message delivery system and I say this I don't think this is quite

06:20.720 --> 06:27.920
what we're for but equally where that was coming from there was a sense of helplessness on the part

06:27.920 --> 06:35.520
of the scientists of you know we have the knowledge we can tell people and the kind of knowledge we

06:35.520 --> 06:41.440
produce is what the modern world says is the only kind of knowledge that is reality and yet when we

06:41.440 --> 06:48.000
come with a message that calls into question our ability to just continue and extend these

06:48.000 --> 06:54.240
trajectories of growth and progress and development as they have been understood around here recently

06:54.880 --> 06:58.160
suddenly they're not listening to us any more than they would listen to the protesters who are

06:58.160 --> 07:07.600
outside the gates of the COP meeting and what I've experienced as a paradox is I find myself trying to

07:07.600 --> 07:14.720
say science has to take a humbler role in relation to the other kinds of knowledge and practice that

07:14.720 --> 07:23.760
are showing up here to people who are experiencing a sense of helplessness as scientists or as people

07:23.760 --> 07:30.400
bringing the message from science where to say that more humility might be what's called for

07:30.400 --> 07:35.520
which I think was also in the language that you were using just now at first glance that sounds

07:35.520 --> 07:40.240
like the last thing that is needed and yet there's a deep truth in there and actually a sense of relief

07:40.240 --> 07:45.600
often when we get properly into dialogue with scientists and non-scientists around this at

07:45.600 --> 07:50.320
science not being asked to carry all the weight of knowing the world and telling us what it needs to

07:50.320 --> 07:56.080
what needs to be done absolutely and the the false impression that science can do far more than

07:56.080 --> 08:04.160
science can ever be asked to achieve is one of the reasons for people feeling that science is an

08:04.160 --> 08:13.920
enemy whereas I believe it to be a hugely valuable tool but it is only that and if one can see it as

08:13.920 --> 08:23.760
that and rather over overreaching claims are not made for it then that rift can be reconciled people

08:23.760 --> 08:31.040
can see it for what it is it's when it pretends to be a sort of omnipotent and omniscient or

08:31.040 --> 08:36.160
potentially so you know we're nearly there only a few more experiments and we really understand it

08:36.160 --> 08:44.320
all that is the sort of thing that makes any experience and wise person feel alienated from

08:44.320 --> 08:53.280
the discourse so I think what we want is is to rehabilitate science I find myself in the odd

08:53.280 --> 08:59.840
position that I'm a great believer in both science and reason and I've spent most of my life trying

08:59.840 --> 09:07.040
to practice these these things and it falls to somebody who believes in them passionately

09:07.040 --> 09:14.320
to point out their limitations so another thing that I do is to is to say reason is hugely valuable

09:14.320 --> 09:19.120
but first of all it depends what you mean by reason as it depends what you mean by science

09:20.400 --> 09:27.440
and secondly it depends on what you're asking it to do it can do certain things but beyond that it

09:27.520 --> 09:33.280
can't go so there are certain things that we know are very real but are somehow beyond the reach of

09:33.280 --> 09:39.680
mere reason and the nature of music would be an example we can rationalize about its structure

09:39.680 --> 09:47.440
we can analyze it we can take it apart we can get notes and we can look at them in our electron

09:47.440 --> 09:54.240
microscope and we can say this note is nothing but the music is something very great so it's that

09:54.240 --> 10:02.160
process that needs to be done and so what I'm really saying is the over defensiveness of science

10:02.160 --> 10:07.760
and the over defensiveness of reason are understandable because at the moment they're under attack I think

10:07.760 --> 10:14.080
very wrongly but the reason they may be under attack is because they are misrepresenting themselves

10:14.080 --> 10:21.040
or maybe not even that but there has gone into the popular culture a myth that science can

10:21.120 --> 10:27.200
do everything that reason can answer all our questions but there's absolutely no question

10:27.200 --> 10:35.760
that these claims are unsubstantiated an unsubstantial boom and the analogy that I use is to say you

10:35.760 --> 10:42.480
know how does one be a friend to science yes if your friend is tripping on acid on the roof of a

10:42.480 --> 10:48.080
building and thinks he can fly yes to be a friend to them is not to go yeah man go for it absolutely

10:48.080 --> 10:51.440
it's to put your arm around the shoulder and say why don't we sit down over here and have a little

10:51.440 --> 10:57.200
chat yes which I feel is kind of what you have been been doing in a way that takes it away also

10:57.200 --> 11:03.120
from that the conflictual mode of engagement with the limits of science that doesn't that's a very

11:03.120 --> 11:11.360
good vivid example I like and it's effectively the ancient saying Plato is my friend but a

11:11.360 --> 11:19.520
greater friend is truth and you know so attributed to Aristotle probably wrongly

11:19.520 --> 11:26.480
but it's that that if you are a friend of science and of reason you don't misrepresent it as something

11:26.480 --> 11:32.560
that it isn't because that way you cause a false falling away from it from people who quite rightly

11:32.560 --> 11:39.920
won't accept extreme the extreme positions the very black and white positions that reason

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
wrongly understood and science wrongly understood can adopt a sort of dogmatic position and dogma

11:46.000 --> 11:53.040
is our enemy in whatever form it comes and in our world now there are far too many dogmas and

11:53.040 --> 11:59.600
are too many things that can't be questioned and when you get to that point as Hannah Arendt said

11:59.600 --> 12:06.560
if things can't be questioned you're in a tyranny so one of the things that I get to in thinking

12:06.560 --> 12:13.520
about this is the relationship between what in my terms is knowledge and knowing

12:15.440 --> 12:20.480
and obviously you know we talked about this last night science as a name for this set of

12:20.480 --> 12:26.800
activities only came in around the 1830s prior to that the people who were doing what we think of

12:26.800 --> 12:31.600
as science would have called themselves natural philosophers and in a sense that shift of name

12:31.600 --> 12:38.560
is reflective of a moment in which a monopoly is being granted where this set of activities are

12:38.560 --> 12:46.320
being seen and seeing themselves as the monopoly on knowing on the work of knowledge because that's

12:46.320 --> 12:57.200
what science means what I found myself um thinking about is the place where maybe these scientists

12:57.200 --> 13:02.800
who I was meeting in these rooms talking about climate change were stark is holding the knowledge

13:03.760 --> 13:08.160
where knowledge is the kind of the fruits of these these activities but it's a kind of it's an arms

13:08.160 --> 13:14.400
length thing and then there's another piece of work which is bringing the knowledge home and if

13:14.400 --> 13:19.200
you think about the way in which the language of knowing I mean if we go to the Hebrew Bible for

13:19.200 --> 13:28.080
example the word to know include can range from you know sexual intercourse to intellectual

13:29.280 --> 13:38.240
apprehension or the fruit of the tree of knowledge in Genesis there is a there's a kind of dance for

13:38.240 --> 13:48.320
me between you know the experience of knowing out of which I distill knowledge that can be shared

13:48.400 --> 13:54.320
which includes the kinds that can be put in books and on shelves and then that dance is completed

13:54.320 --> 14:00.480
at the moment where a reader brings their own experience to the words so as to bring them back

14:00.480 --> 14:06.320
to life in their experience of knowing which will not mirror perfectly the experience of

14:06.320 --> 14:11.680
knowing that led me to write it but it's a bit like two choreographers who use the same set of

14:11.680 --> 14:16.800
choreographic notation the dance that the second choreographer will make from the notations of

14:16.800 --> 14:23.040
the first will be recognizably akin to the first one and so there's this kind of three

14:23.040 --> 14:27.360
three-way move of the experience of knowing the production of knowledge and then the experience

14:27.360 --> 14:33.200
of knowing arising from encountering that which when I then read the master and his emissary felt

14:33.200 --> 14:40.320
to me very close to the dance of the hemispheres that you're describing which was striking because

14:40.320 --> 14:46.320
what I had been saying was I think we've got the a hierarchy where knowledge is held to be the

14:46.320 --> 14:51.200
important bit rather than the experience of knowing that might be part of where we're

14:51.200 --> 14:56.320
getting stuck part of the trouble we ran absolutely that's a very rich vein to mine

14:58.720 --> 15:04.640
and as you know I sometimes contrast and I don't think it's exactly the same but the

15:04.640 --> 15:09.920
difference is that we have in German and French for different kinds of knowledge so there's there's

15:10.000 --> 15:16.960
Canon in German and Konnetto in French which means knowing from experience and there's

15:16.960 --> 15:23.760
Wissen in German and Savoie in French which is to know as it were the facts and another way of

15:23.760 --> 15:31.840
talking is that there is data there is information there is knowledge and there is understanding

15:32.720 --> 15:38.800
and understanding is intelligence and it's what in fact whatever you do with AI but that's

15:38.800 --> 15:44.320
another story you won't achieve that understanding because to have that understanding you have to

15:44.320 --> 15:51.840
have lived an embodied life with emotions and and the body and all the the what we think of

15:51.840 --> 15:58.720
as disadvantages that go with that so yes and the other thing is that what you describe is what has

15:58.720 --> 16:08.160
been amusingly dubbed the McGillchrist manoeuvre which is which is my my theme that in all

16:08.160 --> 16:16.640
understanding there is a three-step process the first take on anything as it were preconceptually

16:16.640 --> 16:23.040
and as a whole is taken by the right hemisphere then at a subsequent stage it is broken down

16:23.120 --> 16:29.600
categorized analyzed it's it's the bare bones of its structure were examined

16:30.240 --> 16:35.920
but then all that knowledge needs to be taken back into the holistic picture of the right

16:35.920 --> 16:42.560
hemisphere and absorbed there and become in a way implicit in that picture the easiest example I can

16:42.560 --> 16:47.040
give is that of learning a piece of music but you're first attracted to it as a whole as you

16:47.040 --> 16:52.000
start to play it you realize you have to practice certain passages and you start thinking intellectually

16:52.000 --> 16:57.120
about the harmonic structure but when you go on stage to perform you must forget all that not

16:57.120 --> 17:03.200
that it was wasted time it was very important time but that now it must be taken up into and become

17:03.200 --> 17:08.160
implicit in the whole so I think that's I hope that something to do with what you were talking

17:08.160 --> 17:13.360
about with knowledge the distinction of knowledge and knowing I mean perhaps interestingly knowledge

17:13.440 --> 17:22.960
is is is a noun knowing is a verbal participle and you're what you're talking about is the

17:22.960 --> 17:31.840
idea of something which is a lived experience yes yes exactly and one of the the things that

17:31.840 --> 17:37.040
worries me about the ways in which we are responding to things like climate change

17:37.040 --> 17:41.200
and actually I wonder if this thought might be extended even to the way in which we responded

17:41.200 --> 17:49.280
to the pandemic is this sense of seeing the world through in your terms the left brain

17:50.320 --> 17:55.440
perspective so that the world comes to be conceived of as a problem to be solved

17:55.440 --> 18:01.920
that if we can just map if we can generate enough knowledge about how the world works

18:02.800 --> 18:08.400
then we can come up with the set of solutions for managing the world as if the world is a thing

18:08.400 --> 18:12.960
that needs to be turned into knowledge for its own good in order for it to continue to

18:13.520 --> 18:18.720
have a chance of existing and I think that people can build very kind of convincing

18:19.680 --> 18:24.720
arguments for what needs to be done that could actually lead us to very dystopian places

18:25.280 --> 18:31.520
indeed and arguably yeah well and the the analogy which I get from my friend Paul Kingsnorth

18:32.080 --> 18:37.680
he talks about all the things that he's learned from keeping a fish tank with a few

18:37.680 --> 18:44.720
freshwater fish in it with his son and how this you know you have to measure the temperature it

18:44.720 --> 18:48.880
can't get too hot can't get too cold you have a whole chemistry set of different things that you

18:48.880 --> 18:56.000
have to drop into it to regulate it and all of this to do what a river or a lake does easily

18:56.000 --> 19:02.640
and for free and my concern is that this left brain approach to the world when it is granted the

19:02.640 --> 19:08.800
kind of dominance that it has had in modernity comes to can't see the difference between a fish

19:08.800 --> 19:15.200
tank and a living world comes to represent the living world as if it were a fish tank and then

19:15.200 --> 19:21.600
attempts to turn the world into a fish tank a thing that requires a total system of human

19:21.600 --> 19:31.360
management and control yes again there's a there's a lot in that I think one being the difference

19:31.360 --> 19:40.320
in scale which shouldn't superficially shouldn't make a difference but it does because what we're

19:40.320 --> 19:44.320
dealing with in nature and what we're dealing with in human society and dealing with with

19:44.320 --> 19:53.200
everything important in this world are complex systems not complicated systems and the distinction

19:53.200 --> 19:58.720
being one which is effectively just like a large mechanical system the complicated system just takes

19:58.720 --> 20:04.400
a bit few more arrows and a few more algorithms but the complex system is one that cannot

20:04.400 --> 20:11.600
intrinsically be modeled in this way it has reentrant loops it has uncertainty involved in it

20:12.400 --> 20:21.840
and so there is a grave danger that complex situations are resolved into a complicated

20:21.840 --> 20:31.920
structure there was a hilarious piece of analysis carried out for the US army in Afghanistan by a

20:31.920 --> 20:38.560
London consultancy firm and who generated a map of all that was going on in Afghanistan and it's

20:38.560 --> 20:44.640
hilarious it's a huge map like this and it's got little centers everywhere and arrows going in every

20:44.640 --> 20:51.120
possible direction and when this was presented to General McChrystal a man of experience an

20:51.120 --> 20:57.760
amount of action he responded when we understand that we will have won the war which you can understand

20:57.760 --> 21:03.760
stand in one of two possible ways and but what intrigues me actually is that at the moment

21:04.400 --> 21:11.680
I've just been approached in the last couple of months quite independently by military intelligence

21:13.120 --> 21:19.280
pooled between the UK the US and France and another approach from military intelligence

21:19.280 --> 21:28.960
in Australia to help them untangle why their sort of systematic abstract ways of working

21:28.960 --> 21:36.320
things out are not actually helpful and that we need to reincorporate into this something which is

21:37.200 --> 21:44.960
less certain less tied down and if you make a structure too rigid and tighten up all the

21:44.960 --> 21:52.080
bolts it's got no movement it will crash down so it needs to have this human intelligence in it

21:52.640 --> 21:59.520
another way of putting it is that it needs to be antifragile in Talib's terms but we need to

21:59.520 --> 22:08.160
reintroduce the much stigmatized concept of human judgment and intuition I love that story of the

22:08.160 --> 22:17.840
map in Afghanistan it makes me think of Borges and the one-to-one map because sometimes it seems

22:17.840 --> 22:26.800
as if that's the sort of the unintentional foolishness of this attempt to turn the world into a thing

22:26.800 --> 22:31.760
that needs to be known in order to exist and the other example that was coming to mind as you were

22:31.760 --> 22:38.800
speaking about it was Dean Bavington who's an environmental historian in Canada who comes from

22:38.800 --> 22:46.080
Newfoundland and has written about the Newfoundland cod fishery and the story that he tells is

22:46.960 --> 22:52.880
of how the Newfoundland cod fishery collapsed not once but twice and after the first collapse it

22:52.880 --> 23:01.040
became the pioneering sort of case study of fisheries management where they were convinced

23:01.040 --> 23:06.800
that they now had mapped and knew this wild fishery well enough to say when the boats could

23:06.800 --> 23:12.960
go back out again how much fish they could take and through the 80s it was the world's leading

23:12.960 --> 23:20.800
sustainable fishery and then in 92 it collapsed again and what he describes in fisheries science

23:20.800 --> 23:29.200
is this kind of retreat then from attempting to know the wild living complex world to saying this

23:29.200 --> 23:36.000
is beyond our capacity and so what we're going to do instead is move to fish farming where we create

23:36.000 --> 23:42.880
deliberately simplified ecosystems that we can know and manage in this way that we failed to do

23:42.880 --> 23:49.680
with the wild fishery and of course that is also failing because those systems are never really cut

23:49.680 --> 23:55.920
off from the wild world they have inputs and outputs going into it but it seems like there's

23:55.920 --> 24:02.800
a sort of spiral there which I see in various areas when we're talking about ecological crisis

24:02.800 --> 24:10.560
which is this desire this feeling that we need to know the world in a way that would allow us to

24:10.560 --> 24:18.000
intervene successfully in that way and then cycling between a despair at the failure to do that

24:18.000 --> 24:24.720
and a sort of desperate optimism of trying to remake the world into something like a fish farm

24:24.720 --> 24:29.200
and I think you know in what we've been talking about in the invitation that you're making in your

24:29.200 --> 24:36.880
work I feel like there are clues for letting people know that you know the world might be

24:36.880 --> 24:44.000
something other than the way it appears through this lens and therefore that the failure that

24:44.000 --> 24:48.880
failing to make the world into something that can be known and managed in that way is not the end of

24:48.880 --> 24:56.720
the world only at the end of a way of seeing it sure yes no that's that's surely right but I

24:56.720 --> 25:04.240
suppose the difficulty would be how people can actually put that into practice that's always

25:04.240 --> 25:11.760
the difficult bit yeah it's how do we have you thoughts about that well I think it starts with

25:11.760 --> 25:19.040
giving up in a sense yeah yeah you know it starts with stopping it starts to stop into what you're

25:19.040 --> 25:25.920
doing which is not working yeah yes and it was Gustavo Estavo who's a Mexican activist and thinker

25:25.920 --> 25:30.800
who can really taught me this because he described how he'd had these three times in his life where

25:30.800 --> 25:37.200
he had walked away from a situation without being able to explain why and the last time was in the

25:37.200 --> 25:43.440
mid 70s when he turned down a job as a cabinet minister in Mexico and he said I couldn't explain

25:43.440 --> 25:48.320
to anyone why or what I was going to do but in the way that he talked about it because he then

25:48.320 --> 25:55.200
got involved with these grassroots networks and the the pueblos and the and the barrios of Mexico

25:55.200 --> 26:03.440
city and it was the until he left that position where he was standing he couldn't see what was

26:03.440 --> 26:09.120
invisible from there he had to actually go somewhere else without being able to give anyone

26:09.120 --> 26:16.560
a justification of this move for things to come into view because the way that the people he was

26:16.560 --> 26:22.080
then working with were seen from above from within the system he'd been working in missed something

26:22.080 --> 26:28.320
important about their ability to make life go on so that's the first step of giving up not as an end

26:28.400 --> 26:34.720
but as a necessary I say in the book you know giving up is always giving up on something

26:34.720 --> 26:41.280
though it may feel like everything until after you've done it so that's the sort of the first

26:41.280 --> 26:50.080
move is to stop um stop trying to save the world as we have known it but also stop assuming that

26:50.080 --> 26:55.840
if you give up on that then you know how the story ends yes well that wouldn't particularly we don't

26:55.840 --> 27:03.200
do as Anne Whitehead said um profits uh we don't know what to do with them perhaps taking them

27:03.200 --> 27:08.800
outside and stoning them in some sort of merciful kind of way which is best but when everyone's

27:08.800 --> 27:14.880
asked to predict the future um I sort of think of Neil Spore saying prediction is a particularly

27:14.880 --> 27:21.360
difficult matter especially when it concerns the future so I don't think we ever know and

27:21.360 --> 27:27.520
keeping that space open about what is going to happen is very important and the failure to do so

27:27.520 --> 27:32.080
is is all part of this we must have certainty we must follow this path we know what will happen

27:32.080 --> 27:39.040
we usually won't be following that path something we didn't know happens like the famous um economic

27:39.040 --> 27:48.240
collapse of 2008-9 um where we thought we had now mapped how these markets work so successfully

27:48.240 --> 27:53.680
that they would never crash again and they promptly crashed too the difficulty is taking

27:53.680 --> 27:58.960
something that works as I mentioned earlier on a small scale and I'm trying to suggest

27:58.960 --> 28:05.040
that this is going to work on a larger one for example if you do have a complex system which

28:05.040 --> 28:13.840
can't be reduced to um mechanistic uh chains of causation you can nonetheless find a very small

28:13.840 --> 28:19.600
isolated part of it where it appears that that's what's happening and you can hone in on that and

28:19.600 --> 28:25.520
you can see a little chain of causation and you can interfere with it and produce a result and the

28:25.520 --> 28:30.560
temptation is for science there to say so we understand that now but what you've understood is

28:30.560 --> 28:35.360
how that little chain of causation there worked but you haven't understood the nature of the

28:35.360 --> 28:43.120
hole in which it inheres and and so when one's zooming out from some small scale experiment

28:43.120 --> 28:49.120
usually the thing is quite different problem when you are looking at um the hole in which

28:49.120 --> 28:54.640
whatever it was you modeled along so the there's a distinction that I use in the book between

28:54.640 --> 28:59.920
which came to me from John Michael Greer and it's the distinction between a problem and a predicament

29:00.560 --> 29:05.200
okay and he says you know a problem has a solution and the thought experiment he gives

29:05.200 --> 29:10.960
is he says so suppose that you can get in a time machine and go back to some a prosperous rural

29:10.960 --> 29:16.560
village in the south of England in 1700 equipped with the knowledge of the industrial revolution

29:16.560 --> 29:21.920
that is coming and everything that that is going to mean for the people there and suppose that you

29:21.920 --> 29:25.760
can actually convince them of all of these things that are going to completely disrupt

29:25.760 --> 29:31.200
their ways of life and for a small number of people going to make them amazingly rich off

29:31.200 --> 29:35.920
things that no one's dreamed of yet and for many others mean life in factories or going off to

29:35.920 --> 29:44.240
fight foreign wars and then they say to you so what should we do and there's no answer to that

29:44.240 --> 29:50.160
because it's not a it's not a problem that can be solved it's a predicament okay which mean doesn't

29:50.160 --> 29:54.640
mean that there aren't responses doesn't mean that there aren't actions worth taking and some of those

29:54.640 --> 30:00.720
will be wiser than others but you know the world that's born out of that which is the world of

30:00.720 --> 30:07.360
industrial modernity of the last couple of hundred years that we've been talking about has been better

30:07.360 --> 30:14.240
at solving problems than any human culture that the world has ever seen but increasingly over time

30:14.240 --> 30:18.560
more and more of the problems it's faced with are the consequences of earlier solutions exactly

30:19.200 --> 30:25.360
and meanwhile it almost can't see that some things might not be problems that there might

30:25.360 --> 30:30.560
be predicaments and that another way of seeing and acting might be called for in the face of a

30:30.560 --> 30:38.400
predicament what would that way of acting involve well suspending the belief that you

30:38.400 --> 30:44.400
can solve this now should be an important part of it so a good example of a predicament that we

30:44.400 --> 30:51.360
almost still recognize as a predicament would be mortality you know when we meet somebody i remember

30:51.360 --> 30:56.160
meeting someone who was a who had his membership card of the cryogenics institute okay with the

30:56.160 --> 31:00.640
instructions on the back if you know if you find me dead then put ice around my head and call this

31:00.640 --> 31:07.280
number yeah and uh i mean i shook his hand and it felt like the coldness was sort of creeping

31:07.280 --> 31:15.440
back into him even while he was alive but most of us kind of at a gut level see that as a category

31:15.440 --> 31:20.240
error we see the fact that we're going to die one day is more more like a predicament than

31:21.120 --> 31:27.760
a problem to be solved and it doesn't cancel out the meaning of the fact that we're sitting here

31:28.400 --> 31:34.000
alive now it doesn't remove there being lots of things we can do with the life that we have

31:34.640 --> 31:39.040
but if our response to the fact that we're going to die one day is to try and throw ourselves

31:39.040 --> 31:45.200
into treating that as a problem to be solved then that may not lead us to make the wisest use of the

31:45.200 --> 31:50.640
time that we have indeed there's a further step we could take which is not only not to see it as a

31:50.640 --> 31:58.000
problem but perhaps not even to see it as a predicament but to see it as an inalienable part

31:58.000 --> 32:07.200
of life and something that has its strength too i mean if you take i was very impressed by

32:08.000 --> 32:14.800
something that mary midgley said when she was 92 and i think she died when she was 96 and she was

32:15.760 --> 32:25.520
extremely sharp until the moment she died and she she said it's very easy to come to terms with death

32:25.520 --> 32:31.440
because one only has to ask the question what would it be like if you literally could live on

32:31.440 --> 32:39.120
this earth forever and i'm sure there may be some people somewhere who say oh marvellous but most

32:39.120 --> 32:47.040
of us begin to feel a sort of craziness and almost a sense of panic that there is no end to this

32:47.200 --> 32:56.560
and if that is the case that it's better that it has its its finite nature it has its finest

32:57.280 --> 33:05.280
then it's only a question of when and nowadays we always think a bigger portion is better but

33:05.280 --> 33:11.680
sometimes there's something quite good about the standard portion of a human life as i find myself

33:11.680 --> 33:21.840
three school years and nine at the moment i feel quite happy with the idea and i think that i really

33:22.560 --> 33:31.840
think that the lack of our awareness of death and what it brings to the picancy of life is is a great

33:31.840 --> 33:43.680
loss and in the past of course people would have had a scholar such as i might have had a

33:44.640 --> 33:49.280
skull on the table that reminded me from my twenties onwards that i was going to die and

33:49.280 --> 33:54.960
that this had meaning and once you once you accept this and you don't see it as the enemy of life

33:54.960 --> 34:02.480
but part of the nature of life as i think the chinese the far eastern tradition chinese and

34:02.480 --> 34:08.000
japanese are much better at saying that the transiency of things is not a problem to be

34:08.000 --> 34:14.560
solved not even a predicament this is in fact something very beautiful and part of their meaning

34:15.600 --> 34:24.000
it's a sentence without a full stop on the end has a problem yes and i'm reminded of the story of

34:24.000 --> 34:31.440
Beethoven before he went deaf hearing somebody in a neighboring room playing a piece as far as the

34:31.440 --> 34:37.040
last note in the scale and not actually going there having to go out to press the note before he could

34:37.040 --> 34:44.080
go back to bed the line when paul and i wrote the dark mountain manifesto the line that has

34:44.080 --> 34:49.680
stayed with me most deeply is right at the end when we found ourselves saying the end of the

34:49.680 --> 34:57.840
world as we know it is not the end of the world full stop and together we will find the hope beyond

34:57.840 --> 35:03.600
hope the path that lead into the unknown world that lies ahead and a year or two after we wrote that

35:03.600 --> 35:09.040
i found myself sitting with the philosopher david abram talking about this and in that

35:09.040 --> 35:14.640
conversation a new turn on that came out which was the end of the world as we know it is also the

35:14.640 --> 35:21.920
end of a way of knowing the world and so i think that's what i'm kind of that's what i'm inquiring

35:21.920 --> 35:28.000
into and and i feel like you're one of the people who's kind of holding that question at the moment

35:29.040 --> 35:36.640
well it is wonderful to to to have that expressed because the the idea of the way in which we know

35:36.640 --> 35:44.880
something affecting what it is is absolutely central to to my philosophy and which is why i pay

35:44.880 --> 35:52.480
so much attention to attention and the importance of how we attend not just whether or not we attend

35:52.480 --> 36:00.080
which is important but how we attend by which of course i don't mean the means by which but the

36:00.080 --> 36:07.680
way in which and that changes the nature of the world and i believe that actually once one starts

36:07.680 --> 36:14.720
looking at the world with a different kind of attention it can change its nature quite quickly

36:14.720 --> 36:21.120
and quite responsibly that has been my experience so we don't have to people often say so what do

36:21.120 --> 36:26.720
we do in a way that's a sort of secondary left hemisphere question now we've got a vision of

36:26.800 --> 36:31.440
how we want to do things what are the steps we need to take to accomplish it

36:31.440 --> 36:35.680
and the left hemisphere servant should say well i will go and do this and you say that's a very

36:35.680 --> 36:42.480
good idea and so forth but really what we're talking about is inhabiting our lives inhabiting the

36:42.480 --> 36:48.720
world inhabiting the cosmos in a different way which depends on the nature of the attention

36:48.720 --> 36:56.000
which means a relationship because attention is never a camera doesn't pay attention

36:56.800 --> 37:04.080
a microphone doesn't pay attention it receives and we don't just receive we pay attention and that

37:04.080 --> 37:09.360
means that we bring something of our own to whatever it is that we encounter but i also

37:09.360 --> 37:16.320
profoundly believe that that's something else responds to our attention i don't never have

37:16.320 --> 37:23.920
believed since i was you know a young adolescent that it was true that the world was a sort of

37:23.920 --> 37:30.560
heap of non responsive material it always seems to me to be vibrantly communicating with me and

37:31.280 --> 37:37.520
and that there is this exchange all the time so it out of that exchange comes what is real because

37:37.520 --> 37:43.520
i do believe and i argue philosophically for those who can't see why on earth i would say that

37:44.160 --> 37:50.160
in in the matter with things that relationships are primary that what actually exists first of all

37:50.160 --> 37:59.360
is relationship and that the things are secondary to the relationships so when there are relationships

38:00.880 --> 38:06.640
bits start to stand out and we go oh there's something a thing and that's what we identify

38:06.640 --> 38:14.560
but it's a web of relationships when you think about how an embryo develops into the animal

38:14.560 --> 38:24.000
it doesn't add a liver and a heart and a spina whatever it these things come out of the hole

38:24.720 --> 38:30.160
and they only are embedded in that context of the hole and then they stand out and you go what's that

38:30.160 --> 38:37.120
over there we'll call that the liver you know so in an organism there are areas of relationship

38:37.120 --> 38:44.640
which become what we then call things and this is quite coherent with um something that means

38:45.520 --> 38:52.160
intuitively something to me but is part of all the great so-called wisdom traditions of the world

38:52.160 --> 38:59.280
that whatever we mean by god that first grounding whatever that encompasses it all

39:00.320 --> 39:06.960
is that its nature is love i mean that is a common theme of all these traditions

39:06.960 --> 39:12.720
and love is nothing if it's not a relationship that's exactly what it is it doesn't exist

39:13.200 --> 39:21.760
but you know you don't have to things first love exists and out of love come the beings and i believe

39:21.760 --> 39:31.840
that the the purpose of this is getting a long way out perhaps but and i think that the purpose of

39:33.280 --> 39:39.200
the cosmos one might say why why if there is this ground of being whatever you like to call it the

39:39.200 --> 39:51.440
Tao or god or whatever else why did it bother to create and i think the answer is that it itself

39:51.440 --> 39:57.440
only becomes fulfilled through this act of creation because there's another and there is a reciprocity

39:57.440 --> 40:04.640
so that reciprocity between the divine and ourselves is usually important not just for us

40:04.640 --> 40:11.280
but also for the divine which means that we also play a crucial role in it we're not just passive

40:11.280 --> 40:17.840
observers once again like the camera or whatever we are making ourselves and we are forging the

40:17.840 --> 40:26.560
reality of the universe by our responsiveness and that helps to explain why things evolve

40:26.560 --> 40:34.160
in the way that they have done why why was the first as we believe in animacy and how did animacy

40:34.160 --> 40:40.560
come about and why was why has this animacy taken the form that it has of developing creatures like

40:40.560 --> 40:47.280
ourselves who are in many ways so much shorter lived and more vulnerable than ancient creatures

40:47.280 --> 40:52.960
way back down this phylogenetic tree and there are examples of actinobacteria in the depths of the

40:52.960 --> 41:01.040
ocean single celled organisms that are themselves over 100 million years old so a 70 year life seems

41:01.040 --> 41:08.080
like what's that achieved i think the whole drive of it is towards differentiation the unfolding

41:08.080 --> 41:13.760
like the bud that unfolds and it's not the negation of the bud that it turns into a flower it's the

41:13.760 --> 41:18.720
fulfillment of the bud that it turns into the flower and the flower eventually to the fruit so

41:18.720 --> 41:24.000
all these things that's an image of course from Hegel but that idea that things are fulfilled

41:24.000 --> 41:29.280
through their unfolding their individuation without that threatening the integrity of the whole is

41:29.280 --> 41:39.040
very important and this process leads through life to two important things one is our greater

41:39.120 --> 41:49.040
responsiveness and the other is a much rapider rate of response as a whole as a species or

41:50.560 --> 41:57.360
or even as an individual to the world both a more rapid ability to respond and a far more

41:57.360 --> 42:04.640
intense and wide ranging response so a vole may well appreciate the things in the garden that

42:04.640 --> 42:10.480
i appreciate at some level but there are certainly things that i can see and appreciate as a human

42:10.480 --> 42:15.360
that that vole can't which is not to say that the vole doesn't have things that it appreciates that

42:15.360 --> 42:26.160
i don't take and that's granted but what we bring to the party is our greater response which includes

42:26.160 --> 42:33.040
things like writing the mass in b minor and and this is an extraordinary response to the creation

42:33.120 --> 42:38.080
people sometimes talk about it as though well yes but it's so tragic you know we're tragically

42:38.080 --> 42:43.520
cast into this pointless meaningless universe and our response is to do this but this is

42:43.520 --> 42:50.720
this is back to front that that thing came out of the universe by willingness to listen to it by

42:50.720 --> 42:57.040
willingness to write what i write vast willingness to write what he wrote all these things come out

42:57.040 --> 43:02.000
of the cosmos they can't come from anywhere else so they're in a sense things that are unpacked

43:02.000 --> 43:09.120
that are potential in it so there is no chasm between us and this cosmos and it only looks

43:09.120 --> 43:16.400
like it has no meaning and no awareness because science at some stage in the last couple of

43:16.400 --> 43:24.240
hundred years decided that it would make a simple principle that it was not going to consider anything

43:24.240 --> 43:30.800
that suggested either purpose or responsiveness and and and anything that couldn't be measured and

43:30.800 --> 43:39.680
wasn't material and so at the end of its elaborate process it solemnly pronounces i can't find any

43:39.680 --> 43:45.440
purpose or or any any evidence that consciousness can be real i mean there really are people tenured

43:45.440 --> 43:52.400
professors in western universities who hold the belief that consciousness is an illusion but you

43:52.400 --> 43:59.440
know consciousness for there to be an illusion there has to be consciousness and it seems like the

43:59.600 --> 44:05.440
invitation that is contained in this end of the world as we know it with all of the

44:06.960 --> 44:14.080
the the harm and damage that is unfolding that is also the end of a way of knowing the world is

44:14.080 --> 44:19.360
an invitation back in an invitation back into relation absolutely back into participating

44:19.360 --> 44:25.280
in the world as we always were anyway rather than pretending that we're standing above it and knowing

44:25.360 --> 44:30.560
it and managing it absolutely that is so true and really what i'm saying is that

44:30.560 --> 44:37.760
something as simple as practicing changing the way in which you attend to things changes the world

44:37.760 --> 44:45.200
and changes you and obviously changes for the better a relationship if you can pay appropriate

44:45.200 --> 44:50.640
kinds of attention and of course everything involves a different kind of attention there's a kind of

44:50.720 --> 44:56.560
attention that is detached and is entirely appropriate that for example the surgeon who's

44:56.560 --> 45:03.040
carrying out a delicate operation and simply has to treat the body as not that person that will

45:03.040 --> 45:11.040
wake up from the operation in order to be able to do his or her job efficiently so different kinds

45:11.040 --> 45:16.240
of attention are important and they bring us back into connection with something surprisingly quickly

45:17.200 --> 45:23.680
and so when people sort of despair about what is happening those who wish to find

45:24.800 --> 45:32.080
can find quite quickly what it is that they're seeking and it may be a problem or predicament

45:32.080 --> 45:38.400
that many people won't survive that that is always going to be a possibility maybe our

45:38.400 --> 45:45.680
civilization won't survive maybe it will maybe it will in a in a in a wiser form in a less arrogant

45:45.760 --> 45:53.440
and hubristic form on a much more local level and a much more coherent and interconnected way

45:54.560 --> 46:00.560
we don't know but this this business of being taken back into relationship and this

46:00.560 --> 46:05.840
receptive this giving and this taking which is so fundamental this can be achieved

46:06.640 --> 46:12.000
i'm thinking of an italian philosopher Federico Campania whose work i got to know while i was

46:12.000 --> 46:17.920
working on this book and he he has a lovely way of putting it he says sometimes you are

46:17.920 --> 46:24.240
born into the ending of a world this is the thing that has happened before exactly and the way that

46:24.240 --> 46:30.240
you diagnose this is that the future no longer works because what we ordinarily are talking

46:30.240 --> 46:35.760
about when we talk about the future is an extension of a story that we were born into

46:36.640 --> 46:40.880
and if you've been born into the ending of that story then attempts to extend it no longer

46:40.880 --> 46:45.440
convince anyone and i think a lot of what we've been witnessing around the world in the last 10

46:45.440 --> 46:50.880
years or so is the political manifestation of the failure of the future and the appeal of the past

46:50.880 --> 46:55.760
is so powerful in politics today attempts to invoke the future don't work in the way they

46:55.760 --> 47:02.160
did in the mid 20th century because this world is in some sense coming to an end so what Campania

47:02.160 --> 47:07.200
says is so if it is your discernment that you have been born into the ending of the world that you

47:07.200 --> 47:12.880
were born into what's worth doing and he says well you can stop trying to make sense according to

47:12.880 --> 47:19.040
the logic of the world that is coming to an end and start trying to create good ruins things that

47:19.040 --> 47:24.640
may turn out to be helpful to the people beyond the end of this world to those who have to make

47:24.640 --> 47:30.560
life work among all of the things that will be left behind and carried forwards but understood

47:30.560 --> 47:36.560
perhaps in very different ways after this particular story that we happened to be born

47:36.560 --> 47:41.600
somewhere late in has come to an end and i feel like maybe that's what we're trying to do

47:41.600 --> 47:47.680
as thinkers as writers as artists right now in networks like dark mountain is to make good

47:47.680 --> 47:53.120
ruins things that may turn out to be fertile and full of possibility after the failure of the

47:53.120 --> 47:59.760
future that we were promised that's wonderful and i suppose what it suggests is that we don't

48:00.400 --> 48:05.680
by any means give up on the future we just give up on the future as a projection of

48:06.560 --> 48:13.840
the way we've been doing things exactly and and that that's um a hopeful idea it's a very

48:15.120 --> 48:20.880
profoundly productive idea if it can be embraced and again one has to accept

48:22.000 --> 48:28.240
limits and mortality is one of them and the civilization has some mortality as well in fact

48:28.240 --> 48:34.160
they tend to thrive for a few hundred years probably 300 400 years and then they tend to

48:34.160 --> 48:44.080
decay wherever they have been and so we have to accept that there is limitation but the left

48:44.080 --> 48:54.240
hemisphere absolutely rejects any idea of boundaries limitations finiteness and the simplest example

48:54.240 --> 49:01.120
is that it will absolutely deny that there is anything wrong with it although it has the person

49:01.120 --> 49:07.520
has a paralyzed left arm perhaps the whole side of their body they'll just deny that it exists

49:07.520 --> 49:14.320
rather than accept that there could be a problem or a limit it's always going for we can do away

49:14.320 --> 49:20.000
with the limits the boundaries and a lot of what is wrong with us now is we knew no limits there

49:20.000 --> 49:25.120
were no limits to what we thought we could do and the world would still carry on being okay

49:25.120 --> 49:31.840
this turned out to be predictably actually um a very stupid thing to believe and i can't really

49:33.600 --> 49:39.280
imagine why people still carry on with a philosophy which is all about trying to

49:39.920 --> 49:45.680
dispense with what they see as the limits on being whatever we want and doing whatever we want

49:46.800 --> 49:53.200
so how do we help the left hemisphere at that point where it's stuck in that limitlessness

49:53.200 --> 49:59.040
what what are the moves i mean i think that's what you're doing as a writer it's as difficult as

49:59.040 --> 50:06.640
how god could have helped satan in paradise lost lucifer the brightest and best of his angels

50:07.440 --> 50:15.760
became this grungy competitive force and this is really an introspective understanding as there

50:15.760 --> 50:21.680
is in so many mythologies of an overseeing power that understands and a part of it that thinks it

50:21.760 --> 50:27.120
knows but doesn't and that tries to use up the power so it's a very difficult thing to do however

50:27.120 --> 50:33.920
there are a couple of things that work in our favor and and the first is that we can we can see what

50:33.920 --> 50:40.400
is happening i believe that the left hemisphere is predominant and that this is damaging for a whole

50:40.400 --> 50:47.440
range of reasons since it is less understanding and less intelligent and it's a way of going can't

50:47.440 --> 50:56.000
be sustained and and that means that we can actively favor what the right hemisphere is

50:56.000 --> 51:04.240
we can make a point of listening to understanding and directing our efforts towards receiving

51:04.240 --> 51:10.880
what is the right hemisphere can can tell us and give to us and the other is that the left

51:10.880 --> 51:17.120
hemisphere is rather like in the emperor with with no clothes on that it sort of believes that

51:17.120 --> 51:23.920
it's marvelous and finest on and suddenly you see how pathetic it is and and that that itself is

51:23.920 --> 51:29.680
wonderfully liberating insight that we don't have to be tyrannized by this this voice that says

51:29.680 --> 51:35.040
we're clever we understand it all it's all mechanical we know it we can just say but actually

51:35.040 --> 51:40.720
that's hilarious it's just there's something about laughter in the middle of all this i hope so

51:42.320 --> 51:46.400
this takes me back to the the way that i've thought about knowledge and knowing

51:46.400 --> 51:51.040
because the example i always use to talk about this sort of threshold between the arm's length

51:51.040 --> 51:55.200
knowledge and the experience of knowing is i say think about the moment when you get a joke

51:55.840 --> 52:00.960
you don't have any information that you didn't have the moment before but you see something

52:00.960 --> 52:08.240
differently and it will affect you emotionally intellectually bodily and it that's the simplest

52:08.240 --> 52:14.400
version of the kinds of encounter the kinds of being pulled across a threshold out of the trap

52:14.400 --> 52:23.280
that that we need holy i agree and and i think that humor and the great humorists are up there in

52:24.160 --> 52:28.240
they're up there in my pantheon along with the great poets because what they're doing is just

52:28.240 --> 52:34.000
that a poet doesn't as you were tell you things you didn't know but it helps you to see things

52:34.000 --> 52:39.600
that you thought you'd seen but you didn't really appreciate understand or feel and that is profoundly

52:39.600 --> 52:48.320
moving and humor is in another way the achievement of this kind of an insight through what they have

52:48.320 --> 52:54.000
in common from a sorry to refer to the brain here but what they have in common is that both of

52:54.000 --> 53:01.360
these things depend very largely on the right frontal cortex which can understand implicit

53:01.360 --> 53:08.800
meaning multiple meaning and tone and all these things that modify meaning which are present

53:08.800 --> 53:14.080
in poetry and are present in humor and you know one of the things we absolutely have got to do

53:14.080 --> 53:19.600
is to liberate humor again and and say no it's not good enough to say people can't make jokes

53:19.600 --> 53:25.600
about things they can make jokes about anything and if you don't like it you know that's for you

53:25.600 --> 53:32.880
to sort out so it's as if the the left hemisphere like applying all of this back to the the predicament

53:32.880 --> 53:37.840
or problem or whatever it is of the trouble that the world is in not least in terms of climate

53:37.840 --> 53:45.760
change left hemisphere wants to design a way out of that to come up with a plan that will somehow

53:45.760 --> 53:52.480
allow us to you know reboot the future to have some extension of the world as we have known it

53:52.480 --> 53:58.480
and the invitation is somehow to stumble into another way of being human together to stumble

53:58.480 --> 54:04.400
into another chapter of the story rather than to design and plan it out on a spreadsheet and

54:04.400 --> 54:10.880
implement it in the world yes and that stumble of course is the way the left hemisphere would

54:10.880 --> 54:16.080
think of it that it's a stumble but actually what it is is quite probably a wise move that

54:16.080 --> 54:22.080
comes from our unconscious and what you're really pointing to is that having everything

54:22.080 --> 54:28.400
consciously planned out is not the way to achieve everything in life it's the way to achieve the

54:28.400 --> 54:36.400
solution to various incredibly circumscribed problems it's been estimated that 99.5% at least

54:36.400 --> 54:44.000
of everything that we know as it were with our body with our with our brain is not in the focus

54:44.000 --> 54:49.840
of our consciousness but because of that it can be much much richer and there's an argument for

54:49.840 --> 54:56.960
saying that it's something damaging about making things explicit and and focus because you limit

54:56.960 --> 55:04.240
them to one single simple idea that has to be pursued whereas in the implicit understanding

55:04.320 --> 55:10.400
of a situation one can with enormous economy bring together a whole lot of different

55:11.120 --> 55:17.360
elements that come out of the field of one's experience out of being alive and bring them

55:17.360 --> 55:22.880
to bear and you know here again I just I often quote this but I think it's so mildless and

55:22.880 --> 55:28.480
Whitehead said two things he said that a civilisation advances according to the number of

55:29.360 --> 55:36.480
actions and thoughts that can be taken care of outside of the glare of experience and the other

55:36.480 --> 55:45.440
was that applying thought is like a cavalry charge in battle it's something that can only

55:45.440 --> 55:52.320
been done occasionally is very expensive and requires fresh horses so you can't just be doing

55:52.320 --> 55:58.000
this all the time in fact in a way what one would say is that when only brings this cumbersome

55:58.000 --> 56:03.680
mechanism of you know focusing on it in the full glare of the spotlight and trying to solve a

56:03.680 --> 56:10.880
problem when there is a problem but when things are running well you shouldn't be bringing that glare

56:10.880 --> 56:16.240
to bear on it because you will freeze it much as if the pianist starts to remember his fingers

56:16.240 --> 56:22.720
while playing then have to stop playing and if the problem is actually the estate of frozenness

56:22.720 --> 56:28.320
then you can't attack it with the with the back kind of cavalry charge

56:29.600 --> 56:35.600
yes but also what I was thinking is that when you are focusing on it then you are likely to

56:36.480 --> 56:47.840
either stumble or march whereas when you are not focused on it it's not so much that you will

56:47.840 --> 56:54.240
stumble but you will be guided by something that if you trusted not uncritically and not

56:54.240 --> 57:00.160
without a dialogue with yourself often not the conscious one about what are you doing but you

57:00.160 --> 57:06.480
will be guided by something which is different from what your immediate analysis at the conscious

57:06.480 --> 57:11.520
level would suggest was the way to do it the stumble becomes a dance becomes more of a dance

57:11.520 --> 57:19.200
a step in a dance or something of the kind that comes out of one naturally and I think we all

57:19.200 --> 57:25.040
have the experience don't we of knowing when that happens that I always think of it in relation to

57:25.040 --> 57:33.040
music that if on occasion one dances well and joyously it's because one's not trying to dance

57:33.040 --> 57:39.040
at all but the dance is happening in you and through you and the music too that music plays

57:39.040 --> 57:45.840
itself through you not you play the music so one more layer as we maybe draw this conversation to

57:45.840 --> 57:53.760
a close that's coming to mind for me is this thing that I've been describing as a sort of left

57:53.760 --> 58:00.640
hemisphere attempt to to map and respond to the trouble that the world is in I think that a lot

58:00.640 --> 58:06.000
of those who in good faith are kind of describing and telling us what we need to do about the situation

58:06.000 --> 58:12.800
in these terms it seems to me that they have a map in which the thing that the left hemisphere sees

58:12.800 --> 58:19.840
or this this way of seeing and describing the world that is kind of through calculative measurement

58:19.840 --> 58:25.920
and that kind of reason that this addresses the deep level of reality and then the things that

58:25.920 --> 58:30.240
we're talking about that we might associate with the right hemisphere you know poetry and

58:30.240 --> 58:35.600
humor music they'll say well all of that stuff is lovely and it's this thing that becomes possible

58:36.320 --> 58:40.560
once the people who think like us have done the hard work of making sure there is a platform

58:41.280 --> 58:47.920
underneath it yes and it's almost as if I've noticed this even amongst novelists there is an

58:47.920 --> 58:55.840
attempt to resolve Snow's two cultures dilemma from the mid 20th century by staging a marriage

58:55.840 --> 59:05.280
between the two cultures in which the you know the scientific side plays the husband and the arts or

59:05.280 --> 59:09.360
other ways of knowing play the wife and so they're they're held to be kind of beautiful

59:10.400 --> 59:15.520
entertaining decorative they make the world a better place we wouldn't want the world without them

59:15.520 --> 59:22.320
but it's a good job we have the practical you see the the stereotypes that this is based on and it

59:22.320 --> 59:30.240
seems to me that that then as things get difficult the people who are who have staged that kind of

59:31.120 --> 59:37.280
way of seeing things go well now it's time to now it's time for the hard serious stuff which

59:37.280 --> 59:44.160
requires us to go into the the left brain mode and of course what you're suggesting and I would

59:44.160 --> 59:50.560
say is that this is quite the opposite it's the upside down story yes and it reminds me of the

59:50.560 --> 59:59.760
image of somebody who after an evening hard work in the city goes to Covent Garden to amuse themselves

59:59.760 --> 01:00:05.680
watching the magic flute and they see that real life is the hard stuff of working at Goldman Sachs

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:11.920
but all this stuff is in the evening from Mozart it's just a decoration but of course it's entirely

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:17.760
the other way around that that is the only chance this person is going to have that sort of thing

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:23.200
to bring them into touch with reality and what they're doing in that office under strict lighting

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:31.200
he said this is a fantasy and not necessarily a harmless one so I absolutely agree with that

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.400
and it's the story the left hemisphere tells that it is doing the hard work and it's the one

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.200
that was sold to me as a medical student you know it was almost as though the right hemisphere we

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.960
don't really know what it's there for but perhaps it's there to prop up the left hemisphere so it

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:52.560
doesn't fall over but everything important was done by the left hemisphere but this is not the case

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:59.360
and your example of the magic flute for some reason calls to mind for me the most powerful

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:07.200
experience of this inversion of the stories of reality which was you know when my son was born

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.280
and beforehand I was working at the Swedish National Theatre at the time and my boss who

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:18.560
was about five years older than me had a couple of young children he said birth is the most animal

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:24.160
experience you'll ever be part of and he was of course completely right about that but the bit

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:31.040
I was less prepared for was it was also the most mythic experience that the temporality of that

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:37.200
journey through birth and the turns within the journey was absolutely something that was familiar

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:43.280
to me from you know the terrain of fairy tale and mythic story and the kinds of journey that's

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:52.240
being staged in the magic flute that oh somehow the the kind of again the linear accountancy

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.280
version of time is not the thing that's there underneath not the thing we encounter when we're

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.880
there with the blood of birth or death but actually in those moments we're not just we're

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:09.120
simultaneously drawn into the fact that we have always all along been animals and that to be an

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:14.800
animal is to live in dream time and myth time more than to live in the kinds of time that you know

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:20.160
the guys under the strip lighting in the city office or lots of the ways that we do science or

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:28.640
talk about science imply is they the true real there yes I suppose it's that these existential

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:36.240
encounters of birth and death that we realize that time isn't the I think it's very real but it

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.720
isn't it's not like science science is very real and important but isn't necessarily the way it's

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:47.840
now conceived and time is other than the way it is now conventionally conceived and that would take

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.760
us a long time I have a chapter in the matter of things solely on time and the ways in which the

01:02:53.760 --> 01:03:02.000
hemispheres see it but I really like that and this idea of a process struck me very forcibly

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:12.480
because when my third child was born my mother was dying and my mother was at one part of the M3

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:20.720
and my wife was in the labor suite in Winchester and I had to consult with the

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:29.600
obstetrical team and take time to go up the motorway say goodbye to my mother and come back

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:36.400
to see my daughter born so you can imagine the strange experience of that and the emotions and

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:48.960
the sense of being in a non bureaucratic time so yeah well thank you Ian I hope that conversations

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:55.440
like this provide sort of strange little openings or doorways through which people have a chance

01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:02.080
of stumbling into another way of seeing where we find ourselves and we're blinding yes dancing

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:12.720
in there another way thank you very much it's been lovely do go talking
