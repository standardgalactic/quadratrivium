Checking Dr Iain McGilchrist/Dr Iain McGilchrist & Dr Rupert Sheldrake - Intersection of Consciousness and Matter.txt
 The discussion revolves around the concepts of intelligence in cells, regeneration, and the historical and current understanding of biological development and organization. The speaker appreciates Rupert Sheldrake's awareness and deep roots in the holistic tradition within biology, particularly his recognition of the work of early 20th-century scientists like G.E. Hutchinson and the school of ecological associationism.

Sheldrake himself, while not explicitly endorsing morphic resonance or related concepts like Ralph Abraham's representational drift in public scientific discourse, is believed to be open to such ideas if they were supported by evidence. His influence in biology, especially in the realm of molecular biology, makes him cautious about openly supporting theories that could label him a heretic within the scientific community.

The conversation touches on the ability of cells to inventively repair themselves without explicit genetic programming or prior experience and how this relates to broader patterns recognized by the whole organism. The discussion also references Schiller's work on brain injury recovery, which exemplifies a conceptual pattern recognition at a higher level, similar to representational drift.

The historical context of morphogenetic fields in the 1920s is brought up, highlighting how the idea of fields provided a holistic explanation for regeneration and development, drawing an analogy with magnetic fields as introduced by Michael Faraday in the 19th century. The speaker emphasizes that while physical fields can push or pull, what truly draws us forward—be it spiritually, morally, intellectually, or biologically—is a more profound, front-drawing force rather than just mechanistic pushing forces.

The conversation showcases the creative and dynamic nature of dialogue between individuals with diverse perspectives, leading to new insights and fresh understandings.

1. The discussion revolved around the idea that individuals should be encouraged to develop practical skills, which can be highly satisfying and beneficial for society, particularly in addressing the shortage of skilled labor.

2. There are existing government schemes and retraining grants aimed at helping people in economically deprived areas. These could potentially be repurposed or revised to align with the suggestions made during the conversation.

3. The current educational and employment systems often treat individuals as interchangeable parts within a machine, rather than nurturing their innate skills and interests. There is a call to shift from a micromanaging administrative approach to one that focuses on growing and developing individual talents and passions.

4. A notable point made was the current skill shortage or employment shortage in various countries, including Britain and Canada, which is not necessarily due to Brexit but may be because many people have voluntarily retired before reaching retirement age, finding their jobs unrewarding.

5. The conversation highlighted that professions once considered rewarding, like teaching and medicine, are now heavily micromanaged, which may contribute to a disinterest in these fields among professionals.

6. An example of positive change was the response of doctors during the Covid crisis, who took initiative and used their experience to navigate the pandemic without being overly managed by those lacking hands-on expertise.

7. The speakers emphasized the importance of showcasing living examples, like themselves, to demonstrate that it is possible to break out of restrictive systems and thrive by following one's interests and developing skills.

8. The conversation closed with gratitude for the dialogue and for the fortuitous opportunities they have both experienced, which underscored the possibility for others to do the same in the future.

Checking Dr Iain McGilchrist/Perspectives on the Nature of Reality to Inform Systemic Change Dr Iain McGilchrist,CERN,Switzerland.txt
1. **Art and Creativity**: In a world dominated by the left hemisphere, art would become more conceptual, with an emphasis on depth, bizarre perspectives, and Latin terminology. This reflects the right hemisphere's way of seeing the world, which was independently developed in Greece, Rome, and Florence.

2. **Music**: Music would lean more towards rhythm than melody or harmony due to the left hemisphere's processing abilities. Professional musicians who train their brains might be an exception.

3. **Language**: Language would become more abstract and less grounded in concrete reference, with a tendency to avoid evoking a sense of awe or wonder.

4. **Flow and Work**: The flow of work would be reduced to an endless series of unconnected tasks, with a loss of tacit knowledge and an overemphasis on explicit rules.

5. **Values**: The speaker laments the current prioritization of utility and pleasure over more meaningful values like courage, magnanimity, fidelity, generosity, and beauty. These virtues are seen as qualities of those who are naive or 'suckers.'

6. **The Holy**: In the current upside-down world, the concept of the holy is often reduced to a tool for religious leaders to gain power, rather than being a profound aspect of human experience.

7. **Power and Manipulation**: There's a strong desire for control and manipulation, which is characteristic of the left hemisphere's mode of operation.

8. **Purpose**: The speaker suggests that humanity has lost a sense of inherent purpose beyond utilitarian goals.

9. **Truth**: There is a war on truth, with politicians, bureaucracies, and AI systems increasingly blurring the lines between truth and falsehood. This devaluation of truth impacts all areas of life, including how we interact with each other and the world around us.

In essence, the speaker is conveying a concern that society has become overly rationalized and utilitarian, losing touch with deeper human values and the sense of wonder that gives meaning to our lives. The left hemisphere's dominance has led to a devaluation of the right hemisphere's capacities for creativity, empathy, and spirituality.

 In this conversation, Iain McGilch discusses the common stereotype that positions the arts and humanities as less practical or important than scientific and analytical fields. He argues against this view, suggesting that this narrative is upside down—art and creativity are not decorative add-ons but fundamental to our understanding of reality.

Iain uses the example of attending a performance at Covent Garden after a day of hard work to illustrate how we often perceive art as an evening's entertainment rather than a deep engagement with life itself. He points out that for many people, their only meaningful contact with the arts comes through such experiences, which are as real and significant as their professional lives.

He also shares a personal story about the birth of his son, highlighting how the experience was both deeply animalistic and profoundly mythic, challenging the linear, accountable view of time often associated with left-brain thinking and city life. This moment of birth brought him face to face with the non-linear, dreamlike nature of time that is more akin to the way it's experienced in myths and fairy tales than in scientific or bureaucratic contexts.

Iain emphasizes that our interactions with existential moments like birth and death reveal a deeper understanding of time, one that is not confined to the conventional clocks and schedules but is richer, more complex, and more human. He suggests that conversations like this can serve as "strange little openings" for people to reconsider their perceptions and find a new way of seeing the world and their place in it.
