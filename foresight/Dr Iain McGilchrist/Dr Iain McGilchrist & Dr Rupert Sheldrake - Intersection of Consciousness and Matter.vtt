WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.120
and welcome everyone. My brother-in-law Alastair McWhorter once wrote a short story where he said

00:13.120 --> 00:19.040
the boys got up earlier than anyone has ever got up before, and that seems to apply to

00:19.600 --> 00:27.120
some of our dedicated attenders from the US. I'm going to light a candle first before I say

00:27.120 --> 00:43.440
anything else. And I've got a match that works today. Yes, there we are. Good. So a warm welcome

00:43.440 --> 00:51.840
to this dialogue with Rupert Sheldrake and Ian McGilkerist. I've known Ian and Rupert for over

00:51.920 --> 01:01.520
40 years. And so our connection goes back a long way. And I'd like to start with just a remark or two

01:01.520 --> 01:10.240
on reading. And this comes from the obituary this week in the Telegraph of John Thorne, who was headmaster

01:10.240 --> 01:16.400
of Winchester when I was teaching there and when Ian was a pupil. And in 1981, he was chairman of

01:16.400 --> 01:26.160
the Headmaster's Conference. And he said, I do see a cloud bigger than a man's hand in the decline

01:26.160 --> 01:32.720
of reading, he told HMC. If it is not done at school, it may never be done. And I think this

01:32.720 --> 01:39.280
is a prophetic remark. And at Winchester, there's something called the DIV system, which is a

01:39.280 --> 01:45.360
general studies where the don, the teacher, has a lot of latitude in what is read.

01:46.160 --> 01:54.400
And while Ian was at Winchester, one of the books he read at the recommendation of his housemaster

01:54.400 --> 02:01.040
was William James's Varieties of Religious Experience, which is a seminal book of Gifford

02:01.040 --> 02:10.080
Lectures in Edinburgh, 1901, 1902. And so Ian read this when he was probably about 16.

02:10.720 --> 02:16.560
Rupert didn't get around to reading it until quite a bit later. And just yesterday, I'd been

02:16.560 --> 02:22.000
corresponding with a former pupil who was also a scholar at Winchester, Professor Ben Morrison.

02:22.720 --> 02:28.080
And Ben is now the chair of philosophy at Princeton. And my first encounter with him

02:28.640 --> 02:35.920
was that Simon Elliott, one of my friends who was a don as well, he sent him round with a six-page

02:35.920 --> 02:44.640
essay aged 14 entitled, Does God Exist? And he went through the usual arguments. And so I pointed

02:44.640 --> 02:50.640
him in the direction of William James and lent him a copy of Varieties of Religious Experience,

02:50.640 --> 02:58.800
which he proceeded to read. And then we discussed it. And then Rupert appeared first in my

02:59.920 --> 03:05.840
horizon, as it were, at Mystics and Scientists in 1983, when I was teaching at Winchester.

03:05.840 --> 03:10.400
And he was lecturing on his then new book or new-ish book, A New Science of Life.

03:11.360 --> 03:18.480
And I gave him a spare copy of this book here, which is called Talks to Teacher on Psychology

03:18.560 --> 03:25.360
and to Students on Some of Life's Ideals by William James, which I'm sure is still somewhere in

03:25.360 --> 03:30.640
Rupert's library. And then finally, this book here is incredibly important. It's called Human

03:30.640 --> 03:42.400
Immortality. And it's the Ingersoll Lecture on Immortality, 1898, at Harvard University. And

03:42.480 --> 03:48.880
just to start, Ian and Rupert, off, I'm going to read a couple of short passages from the

03:49.600 --> 03:57.600
inclusion of Varieties of Religious Experience. And this is my paperback copy. I read it when

03:57.600 --> 04:06.560
I was 26. And I remember reading part of it in the Beautiful Gardens in Marburg. So he says,

04:06.560 --> 04:10.640
summing up in the broadest possible way the characteristics of the religious life as we

04:10.640 --> 04:18.160
have found them, it includes the following beliefs. One, that the visible world is part of a more

04:18.160 --> 04:24.960
spiritual universe from which it draws its chief significance. Two, that union or harmonious

04:24.960 --> 04:32.240
relation with that higher universe is our true end. Three, that prayer or inner communion with

04:32.240 --> 04:38.560
the spirit thereof, be that spirit God or law, is a process wherein work is really done. And

04:38.560 --> 04:46.560
spiritual energy flows in and produces effects, psychological or material, within the phenomenal

04:46.560 --> 04:57.120
world. And then another very short piece on the self. We have in the fact that the conscious person

04:57.120 --> 05:04.320
is continuous with a wider self through which saving experiences come, a positive content

05:04.400 --> 05:10.400
religious experience, which it seems to me is literally and objectively true as far as it goes.

05:11.360 --> 05:17.520
And the other thing I just wanted to observe about Rupert and Ian is that they are both

05:17.520 --> 05:25.200
voracious readers, and they have read widely and deeply all their lives. And their libraries are

05:25.200 --> 05:29.840
pretty impressive. I have a fairly impressive library as well. So between us, I think we

05:30.640 --> 05:39.680
we span a considerable range. And so I'm going to hand over to you, Ian and Rupert. And I think Ian,

05:39.680 --> 05:49.600
you were going to open the batting as it were. Okay, yes, yes, that's good. I should refer to

05:49.600 --> 05:55.360
Schopenhauer's view that never read books, reading books is for people who got no ideas of their own.

05:56.240 --> 06:03.520
But anyway, can we spotlight Ian, please? And Rupert,

06:05.440 --> 06:13.520
just wait to Rupert appear on the screen. There we are. Yes, I'm speaking from the bedroom of the

06:13.520 --> 06:23.760
daughter of a friend in a flat in London. And yes, it's hard to get my I feel so

06:26.240 --> 06:30.960
so much that I belong where I live that it's quite hard to sort of reconstitute my mental

06:30.960 --> 06:39.040
world here for the moment. But I think what I want to say is that I've become more and more

06:39.040 --> 06:44.240
convinced that none of the things that we desperately need to do to solve the various

06:44.240 --> 06:52.320
problems that we we face and that we talk about a great deal, none of this in the end

06:53.040 --> 07:03.200
will matter unless we are able to get back to the spiritual ground of our being. And in other

07:03.200 --> 07:09.440
words, we could, by some sort of a miracle, we could, we could reverse the pollution of the seas,

07:09.440 --> 07:17.360
we could perhaps do something to at least slow climate change, we could make it harder for people

07:17.440 --> 07:24.080
to carry on felling ancient forests, all this I believe in powerfully. But I also think that

07:24.080 --> 07:31.920
none of it will add up to a hill of beans unless we re-engage with the spiritual basis of a human

07:31.920 --> 07:37.280
life. I don't think it will be any longer know what it is to be a human being. I think people

07:37.280 --> 07:42.560
haven't the foggiest idea what they're doing here, what the cosmos in which they come into being

07:42.800 --> 07:49.520
come into being is like and what their relationship with the earth that is their home is like.

07:51.040 --> 07:57.200
And I'm just going to say a few things for you, but then ask you to respond to them really.

07:57.840 --> 08:05.040
In the new book I wrote The Matter With Things, I suggest first of all that

08:05.760 --> 08:12.960
many of the ways in which we look at the the constitution of the cosmos are upside down or

08:12.960 --> 08:18.160
back to front. So in other words, we tend to think for example that the first of all there are

08:18.160 --> 08:23.120
things and then there are relations between them, some of which we make in our minds, and that's

08:23.120 --> 08:30.080
the way it is. Whereas I argue throughout a very long book that in fact relations are absolutely

08:30.960 --> 08:36.080
primary. There is nothing that truly exists that is not a relation and is not in fact in process,

08:36.080 --> 08:44.240
as Whitehead pointed out. So in other words, relations and processes are primary, not status

08:44.240 --> 08:50.560
and things. And I also believe that for example, it's not that there's literal truth and that's

08:50.560 --> 08:57.200
really the important thing and metaphorical truths are just some kind of semi-imaginary

08:58.000 --> 09:04.560
extension of literal truth. In fact, I believe that all fundamental truths are metaphorical in

09:04.560 --> 09:11.040
nature and that literal truth is just a very special kind that we've invented to describe

09:11.040 --> 09:18.240
a small subset of things that occur at a very everyday level. But for the purposes of what

09:18.240 --> 09:25.920
we're talking about now, I want to suggest that it's not that somehow there is anonymity and then

09:26.000 --> 09:36.080
there is life and then there is consciousness and then there is a sense of the great values,

09:36.080 --> 09:42.880
goodness, beauty, truth and the sacred. I think it's the other way around that what actually exists

09:42.880 --> 09:50.240
fundamentally is a consciousness, which is a field of consciousness, which is divine, which

09:51.040 --> 09:58.080
which has the qualities of attending to and drawing us towards goodness, beauty and truth

09:58.960 --> 10:06.080
and the sense of the holy and sacred. And that it's for this that we've developed

10:06.080 --> 10:14.320
our complexity as human beings, since we are not better than animals, but we are in this sense

10:14.320 --> 10:22.320
above them that we can hope to respond to, to receive, to resonate with and to give

10:22.880 --> 10:29.200
a full and fulfilling response to those leading values that draw us forward.

10:30.080 --> 10:34.160
So that's the way I would like to think of it, Rupert. What would you say to that?

10:35.760 --> 10:40.720
Well, I think of it in a very similar way and so do most people in the world for that matter.

10:41.600 --> 10:46.960
If you actually look at, we live in a particularly godless part of the world, Western Europe,

10:48.640 --> 10:55.120
but it's not quite the same if you go to Africa or India or many other parts of the world, or

10:56.240 --> 11:04.960
Iraq or Iran or I mean the Middle East. Most people are religious in the world and

11:05.920 --> 11:13.280
this kind of secularist, secular humanist, atheist, tinted culture that we have

11:14.160 --> 11:21.680
is a historical anomaly. Most people were religious in Europe. And as Charles Taylor

11:21.680 --> 11:27.760
in his wonderful book, A Secular Age, points out in the year 1500 in Europe,

11:28.800 --> 11:33.680
everyone believed in God, everyone believed in the kind of vision you've just put forward.

11:33.680 --> 11:38.800
It was almost impossible not to, not because people were coerced into believing that,

11:38.800 --> 11:46.000
but because there was just no credible alternative. And what's happened is through the growth of,

11:46.720 --> 11:51.200
first through the Protestant Reformation, the disenchantment of the world that happened

11:51.760 --> 11:59.280
in part through the Protestant Reformation, a lack of emphasis on nature, a focus entirely on human

11:59.360 --> 12:05.760
consciousness. And then through the Scientific Revolution, the Mechanistic Materialist worldview

12:06.800 --> 12:13.120
that's grown out of it, we now have this very secular world where people think that

12:13.120 --> 12:18.560
evolution and life starts from the bottom up, you know, from genes and molecules and cells.

12:19.200 --> 12:24.560
And everything builds up until you've got big enough brains where the light of consciousness

12:24.560 --> 12:31.840
mysteriously comes on. And then we start thinking about bigger things like God, but they're all

12:31.840 --> 12:37.440
just inventions inside our own minds, and hence inside our own brains. And you'd be able to tell

12:37.440 --> 12:51.680
us exactly where. No, I wouldn't do that. I mean, both you and I are discussing in what, in fact,

12:51.680 --> 12:55.840
a whole scientific medical network has been concerned with right from the start is

12:57.440 --> 13:04.480
trying to find a way back to a worldview that is still consonant with science, because science

13:04.480 --> 13:09.520
isn't going to go away. And we've learned a great many things about nature through the scientific

13:09.520 --> 13:17.760
process. But to recover a sense of this connection, which is actually there in all traditions, I mean,

13:17.760 --> 13:24.160
shamanic traditions, all admit that there's a war or all just assume that there's some realm,

13:24.160 --> 13:28.560
they have different views of it, but there are realms beyond our own that what we see is not

13:28.560 --> 13:35.520
all there is. And as my main teacher, Father Bede Griffiths used to point out that, you know,

13:35.520 --> 13:45.040
the center of all religious and spiritual culture is a direct experience of our minds, our consciousness

13:45.040 --> 13:50.800
being part of something vastly greater than ourselves. And as he pointed out, all religions

13:50.800 --> 13:57.280
start from that experience is not a dogma, it's an experience. And then they interpret it. I mean,

13:57.280 --> 14:04.480
his favorite metaphor was the hand and that sort of central experience of unity is like the palm of

14:04.480 --> 14:09.920
the hand. And then it's interpreted in different cultures, in different traditions, different

14:09.920 --> 14:15.920
languages. They like the fingers of the hand, all the different interpretations of this primary

14:15.920 --> 14:21.920
unit of experiences, sense of ultimate unity, which are interpreted in all these different

14:21.920 --> 14:28.880
cultural ways. But that is the central foundation of all these religious traditions. And as far as

14:28.880 --> 14:35.040
we know, this intuition that we're part of something greater than ourselves is very ancient. I mean,

14:35.040 --> 14:41.840
all these cave paintings from 2030, 40,000 years ago, the practice of burying the dead and so on,

14:41.840 --> 14:48.400
all the or dealing with the dead in a ritual way, all these things suggest that this has been part of

14:48.400 --> 14:55.200
human consciousness for a very, very long time. No doubt the forms have changed and the development

14:55.200 --> 15:02.240
of the great religions has sort of put a more unifying aspect on these insights. But it seems

15:02.240 --> 15:08.000
to me that it's been foundational to human life for throughout almost all human history,

15:08.000 --> 15:16.320
with the brief anomaly of Western Europe and parts of North America in the last 150 years.

15:18.560 --> 15:24.400
Yes, of course. And it is worth reflecting on the fact that it would be entirely irrational

15:25.120 --> 15:30.400
to suppose that we were aware of everything in the cosmos. Why on earth would we? I mean,

15:30.400 --> 15:36.480
we know in the very simplest level that there are sounds that we can't hear but that bears and bats

15:36.480 --> 15:46.640
can hear. So what we know is limited by our senses and by the relative unsophistication of our brains.

15:47.680 --> 15:54.080
I say relative because relative to what there is for us to approach, if one has any kind of

15:54.960 --> 16:00.800
sense of imagination, one can see that things that we sense are there and that, as you say,

16:00.800 --> 16:04.960
throughout the world people have believed were there. This is not irrational. This is a very

16:04.960 --> 16:12.480
reasonable supposition. And there are people in, for example, Australia, the native people there who

16:13.200 --> 16:18.560
say they can hear and see things at a distance. They can hear people, ancestors speaking to them.

16:18.560 --> 16:24.640
And who are we, frankly, to say that they don't hear those things? I like the, I think,

16:24.640 --> 16:33.040
I'm sure you would agree, the very important idea of Goethe's that we develop senses to perceive

16:33.040 --> 16:45.120
things in response to the bits of experience that we are able to get. And that, therefore,

16:45.600 --> 16:52.240
if we don't actually allow ourselves to experience certain things, then an organ that we might have

16:52.240 --> 16:59.280
will atrophy. And I suggest that we've allowed organs that would help us to see these things and

16:59.280 --> 17:04.560
hear these things and know these things. We've allowed them to atrophy and that people that we

17:04.560 --> 17:10.320
consider more primitive than us and indeed our own children up to an age before they're

17:10.880 --> 17:17.280
they're told that it's not it's not wise or intelligent to say that you see these things

17:17.280 --> 17:24.480
of you're fantasizing. I mean, these people have the organs of perception that we need in order to

17:26.000 --> 17:32.160
to reach the divine or to have any inklings of it. And I suppose that we all have enough

17:32.160 --> 17:38.480
of an inkling of that that unless we shut it down, we can follow it and one hopes to grow it.

17:38.480 --> 17:44.880
You know, Keats called this world a veil of soul making. And in other words, we are we are

17:44.880 --> 17:53.520
nourishing or stunting the soul by the way in which we live. Yes, well, I think the

17:55.520 --> 18:04.400
one way of looking at it is Charles Taylor suggests that in in Europe in say up to 1500 or

18:04.400 --> 18:12.880
later, people had the idea that minds of porous porosity is a word he uses. And the anthropologist

18:12.880 --> 18:19.280
Tanya Lerman, who's at Stanford, is I think one of the most interesting anthropologists of religion

18:19.280 --> 18:25.600
writing at the moment. And in her latest paper, she talks about porosity in all religions, it's

18:25.600 --> 18:33.600
assumed that our minds of porous to influences from each other influences from spirits, gods, angels,

18:34.240 --> 18:41.920
other beings, that minds are porous. And what Charles Taylor shows is that since the 17th century,

18:42.880 --> 18:49.280
there's been this shutting down. So the idea we've ended up ended up with is our minds are

18:49.280 --> 18:55.520
completely insulated with inside the privacy of our skulls, nothing but the electrical

18:55.520 --> 19:01.760
activity of our brains or other activities of the brains inside our heads. And they're all

19:01.840 --> 19:10.560
separated off from everything else, completely privatized. And what Tanya Lerman shows is that

19:10.560 --> 19:19.360
she wrote her most recent book is called How God Becomes Real. And the previous one was called

19:19.360 --> 19:27.840
How God Talks Back. She's done anthropological studies of charismatic Christians, evangelical

19:27.840 --> 19:35.520
groups, women, women praying in Tehran, Muslim women praying in Tehran, shamanic cultures and

19:35.520 --> 19:42.320
so forth. She's done and she shows that in all these traditions, there's the idea that we're open

19:42.320 --> 19:49.680
to spirits or beings of other kinds. But she also points out that this is actually something that

19:49.680 --> 19:57.120
requires a cultural reinforcement and effort on our part. You know, if you believe in God,

19:57.120 --> 20:03.680
it's not just a kind of passive belief that people who believe in God pray, they go to temples,

20:03.680 --> 20:10.160
churches, services, they meet with others, they pray together, they have annual ceremonies,

20:10.160 --> 20:18.560
rituals, practices, etc. There's a lot of work goes into making these beliefs more apparent and more

20:19.120 --> 20:26.240
directly experienced. And I think something similar happens with people who have to put in

20:26.320 --> 20:32.800
quite a lot of work to maintain the secular worldview, to maintain the secular atheist

20:32.800 --> 20:38.640
worldview. Denying all these things involves quite a lot of hard work on denial. You first of all

20:38.640 --> 20:46.240
have to deny all your own telepathic experiences and 85% of people have these experiences with

20:46.240 --> 20:51.920
telepathic telephone calls. You have to deny that you can really tell when someone's staring

20:51.920 --> 20:58.000
at you from behind and 95% of people have experienced that. You have to deny that you have

20:58.000 --> 21:04.080
flashes of insight or mystical experience that appear to connect you with a consciousness

21:04.080 --> 21:10.560
greater than your own. If you take psychedelics, which give a wonderful sense of connection with

21:10.560 --> 21:16.800
something greater than yourself, you have to deny that that's real. But you just have to say, well,

21:16.800 --> 21:24.480
that's just because chemical disturbances inside the brain. So even atheism and secularism

21:24.480 --> 21:33.200
require quite a lot of effort in denial. And the motive for the denial, I suppose,

21:33.200 --> 21:41.040
is fitting in with the secular world. And what the only positive side of it or is a self-congratulatory

21:41.040 --> 21:45.840
feeling, you're smarter than everyone else, because you've seen through all these false

21:45.920 --> 21:52.080
beliefs and childish attitudes that children have and so-called primitive people do.

21:53.280 --> 21:58.560
When you were reading the Varieties of Religious Experience at school, I had a housemaster who

21:59.280 --> 22:07.360
he was trying to show me the limitations of the orthodox Christianity in which the school chapel

22:08.320 --> 22:17.200
we all had to go there every day. And I was reading bits of J.G. Fraser's The Golden Bow

22:17.200 --> 22:24.080
and Robert Green's White Goddess. His aim was to prove to me that Christianity was no better

22:24.080 --> 22:31.440
than these primitive, superstitious beliefs found all over the world. And since we were

22:31.520 --> 22:36.960
quite happy to dismiss all of them as mumbo jumbo, the same applied to Christianity, it was

22:36.960 --> 22:42.160
no better than them. And the first I was persuaded, I thought this was an appalling weakness because

22:42.160 --> 22:48.880
it presumed to be superior to these other beliefs. I've later come to see this as tremendous strength

22:48.880 --> 22:55.040
that it has so much in common with myth and archetypal patterns found all over the world.

22:56.000 --> 23:04.000
But the idea that we're smarter than others, Fraser and all those late 19th century figures,

23:04.000 --> 23:10.240
early 20th century figures, had the view that we've risen above the sort of animistic superstition

23:10.240 --> 23:15.840
and then you get religion, which is a bit better, not much better. And then you go beyond that to

23:15.840 --> 23:20.400
science and then you realize all that stuff, basically childish rubbish we've drove great

23:20.400 --> 23:27.200
and out of. So I think that that's how we've got here. And I think it does take quite a lot of

23:27.200 --> 23:34.400
effort, as I say, for people to maintain that belief. And I suppose that you would map some of

23:34.400 --> 23:43.600
this, I'm just guessing, onto actors of different parts of the brain. Yes, maybe. I mean, before

23:43.600 --> 23:58.640
we go there, though, you raised a number of interesting points. I argue also in my chapter

23:59.840 --> 24:09.520
28 of the matter with things of the sense of the sacred, from evidence given by psychological

24:09.520 --> 24:17.920
studies that actually it takes more effort to deny. It's not true that as Dawkins suggests that

24:17.920 --> 24:24.160
we are indoctrinated into religion. In fact, it's the opposite that it takes more cognitive effort

24:24.160 --> 24:32.080
to inhibit these ideas. That doesn't mean that they're wrong, of course. But it is interesting

24:32.080 --> 24:39.920
that if you have people, and maybe that is to do with the brain, that some people, especially

24:39.920 --> 24:47.920
people with autism, and who are something like a 10 times more likely to be atheistic,

24:50.880 --> 24:59.200
the normal brain is actually allowing us to, if we will not suppress it, to experience the

24:59.200 --> 25:06.400
sort of things that you're talking about. And going back to my idea that the things that we

25:06.400 --> 25:13.680
think are primary are not, and the things that we think are secondary are not. So in the case of

25:14.240 --> 25:21.280
oneness, you were talking about how we have to go back to an idea of being porous. But this is,

25:21.280 --> 25:27.520
as you're suggesting, I think this is the natural state to see ourselves as in connection with the

25:27.520 --> 25:39.200
world. And you get in panpsychism a very interesting phenomenon, which is that people say, okay,

25:39.200 --> 25:45.040
so how do we, okay, maybe the logical position, since we can't see how to get

25:45.840 --> 25:50.640
consciousness out of mere lumpen matter, maybe the answer is everything's got consciousness in it.

25:50.640 --> 25:54.960
But then how do we recompose it? You know, how do we put this together? It's actually called

25:54.960 --> 25:59.280
the combination problem. This is typical of the left hemisphere, which having, first of all,

25:59.280 --> 26:05.360
ruptured a unity, then doesn't know how to, quote, recreate the unity. But the unity is there.

26:05.360 --> 26:11.840
The unity is primary, not a secondary phenomenon that has to be put together and achieved.

26:13.120 --> 26:20.160
So I think that that kind of panpsychism is, is somewhat irrational and left hemisphere dominated.

26:20.160 --> 26:24.240
Now, you've brought me to the position where, of course, I've mentioned hemispheres.

26:25.680 --> 26:30.080
And I should say to anybody listening that my position is not that the brain

26:30.960 --> 26:35.840
creates our experience at all. I say that logically, there are three possibilities,

26:35.840 --> 26:44.480
the brain either imits experience, or it transmits experience, or it permits experience.

26:44.560 --> 26:50.560
And I, I believe that in fact, the brain is a permitter of experience that shapes it,

26:51.360 --> 26:57.280
much as the vocal chords, as William James pointed out, are what shape his voice,

26:58.160 --> 27:03.920
a restriction, a constriction and inhibition and negation, some kind of molding or

27:05.360 --> 27:13.200
no saying to the breath that would come through. If there was no such molding or permitting,

27:13.200 --> 27:21.120
then there would be no voice at all. But coming to the boring stuff about brain correlates,

27:21.120 --> 27:27.920
we do know that I'm afraid it just isn't a matter of fact. And I give, I think it's appendix

27:28.720 --> 27:36.320
seven or something in the matter of things. I do go over the science on hemisphere difference in

27:36.400 --> 27:48.080
spirituality in relation to mindfulness, meditation in general, and shamanism, religious

27:48.080 --> 27:55.280
experiences of certain kinds. And the overwhelming evidence is that this requires a shift of balance

27:55.920 --> 28:06.080
away from the normal slight, uh, bias towards the left hemisphere. In these experiences, one finds

28:06.080 --> 28:12.640
that this imbalance, if you like, is redressed and not only redressed, but that the centers

28:13.600 --> 28:21.280
that are subtending these kinds of experience are very clearly right hemisphere related. So

28:22.080 --> 28:29.840
in a culture which I believe promotes the values of the left hemisphere, sees the world as particulate,

28:30.400 --> 28:39.360
made up of isolated things that are fixed, that are unchanging, inanimate, abstracted,

28:39.360 --> 28:47.600
explicit. There is no room for this kind of, this kind of experience. Indeed, I was talking yesterday

28:47.600 --> 28:53.200
to clergy in Canterbury, and I don't know what they thought of it. But I was trying to explain

28:53.200 --> 28:58.400
that all the sort of things that you need in order to open your mind to the existence of a divine

28:58.400 --> 29:04.400
being are militated against by the natural mode of the left hemisphere, which is to pin things down,

29:04.400 --> 29:12.960
to look for certainty, to focus on the explicit rather than the implicit, to see things as naturally

29:12.960 --> 29:22.480
inanimate rather than animate, and to be all the time cataloging and charting experience as on a map,

29:23.040 --> 29:29.200
or having a theory about it rather than actually allowing experience to come to you. To do that,

29:29.200 --> 29:33.920
you've got to have an opposite cast of mind, which is in fact the cast of mind that the right

29:33.920 --> 29:42.240
hemisphere enables for us in daily life, which is the voice of a way of seeing things in which there

29:42.240 --> 29:47.680
is no final certainty. There are things that are probable, and there are things that are more likely

29:47.680 --> 29:53.360
than others, but there's no final certainty. Nothing is finally separated from anything else.

29:54.480 --> 30:00.640
Nothing is ever completely fixed. It's always moving, changing and flowing. All the really

30:00.640 --> 30:06.560
important stuff cannot be put into language. Anybody who's been in love knows how incredibly

30:06.560 --> 30:12.320
feeble the language is to deal with this extraordinary experience. And of course,

30:12.320 --> 30:19.520
any of you who are listening who are persuaded that there is a spiritual realm, a divine realm,

30:19.520 --> 30:28.320
that you can have intimations of, this again is beyond conceptual reduction in language.

30:30.320 --> 30:38.560
The right hemisphere enables us to be more willing to accept paradox, to accept things

30:38.560 --> 30:45.200
that are not certain. And this is the realm where we find the spiritual life.

30:47.600 --> 30:55.200
Yes, the sense of not certainty, I mean, there is a sense though in some spiritual experiences

30:55.200 --> 31:00.400
where there is a great certainty. I mean, for example, people have had near death experiences,

31:00.400 --> 31:06.080
or mystical experiences spontaneously, or as a result of spiritual practices,

31:06.080 --> 31:14.080
or as a lot of psychedelics. I mean, I myself, when I've had some of these types of experiences,

31:14.080 --> 31:18.640
one of the things that people say about them is that you know that it's real, that it's

31:18.640 --> 31:26.000
more real than normal reality. And near death experiences which last a few minutes,

31:26.960 --> 31:33.040
change people's lives because they feel they've contacted a realm, a reality which is

31:33.040 --> 31:38.320
more real, more certain in a way than the ordinary world we live in. And they don't

31:38.320 --> 31:42.880
have any doubt that there's this spiritual reality because they've directly experienced it.

31:43.440 --> 31:49.840
Now, I don't know whether that, to what extent that depends on one or both hemispheres,

31:49.840 --> 31:59.280
or whether it goes beyond the brain altogether. But what's so convincing for many people about

31:59.280 --> 32:02.880
these experiences is precisely that they seem unquestionably real.

32:03.840 --> 32:10.560
Yes, raises two points really. One is this. I would make a distinction between

32:11.520 --> 32:19.120
the absolutely certain and an asymptotic approach to certainty. And the left hemisphere

32:19.120 --> 32:25.840
has a category of things that are yes and no. And I don't think that experience, well,

32:25.840 --> 32:31.120
not in my experience, there is ever this, I'm not lucky enough to have had one of these experiences,

32:31.120 --> 32:36.080
but I imagine if I had one, I'd say I'm almost as certain of this as I can be of anything,

32:36.080 --> 32:42.240
which is different from claiming absolute certainty or absolute truth. But the other

32:42.240 --> 32:47.840
thing about it is something that my housemaster Martin Scott, the man who really modeled for me

32:47.840 --> 32:56.640
the wonderful relation between a man who was profoundly sane, very funny, hyperalert to the

32:56.640 --> 33:03.520
ridiculous, was also a deeply spiritual and in that sense, a very serious person. And he

33:03.520 --> 33:09.680
modeled and conveyed to me that way of looking at things. And one of the things he emphasized to me

33:09.680 --> 33:18.160
was that the true religious experience is not really about these moments of certainty or about,

33:18.160 --> 33:23.840
you know, levitating or seeing the future or any of these things nice as they may be. They are not

33:23.840 --> 33:29.920
the center of it. And that in fact, they're not particularly prized by the mystics who had these

33:29.920 --> 33:39.200
experiences and not particularly prized actually by the Buddhist masters. They don't think that

33:39.200 --> 33:44.960
these amazing transformative experiences are really what it's about. But it's typical of our

33:44.960 --> 33:50.320
society that we would imagine that there is an experience of this kind. And it's not about a

33:50.320 --> 34:00.480
more humble application of a kind of disposition towards the world, which is one of awe and humility

34:01.680 --> 34:07.440
and compassion, which I believe is at the center of it. So I'm not disrespecting extraordinary

34:08.080 --> 34:15.200
experiences. I'm just saying that I'm a skeptic amongst believers and I'm a believer

34:15.200 --> 34:22.880
amongst skeptics. I've always been like this. And when people do this, I find myself suddenly

34:22.880 --> 34:29.040
running to the other part of the balance here to sort of keep things properly in perspective.

34:30.800 --> 34:35.440
Well, speaking from my own experience, I've had these moments of insight where I've just

34:36.000 --> 34:43.600
known that there's a greater consciousness than all my experience. But on a day to day basis,

34:43.600 --> 34:50.400
those are quite rare, those experiences are not like every day. And that's where spiritual practices

34:50.400 --> 34:57.920
come in. And I myself meditate in the mornings and I pray in the evenings. And I see these as

34:57.920 --> 35:04.160
different daily ways of relating. I see the meditation, I think I was more like breathing in.

35:04.720 --> 35:13.120
And I close my eyes, I try not to be occupied with the things in my room or wherever I'm doing it.

35:14.560 --> 35:22.000
I have mantras, I concentrate on the mantra and sit quietly, and thoughts go through my mind and

35:22.000 --> 35:28.480
so on. And so it's a way of withdrawing not only from the outer world, but also from the inner world

35:28.480 --> 35:34.800
of the default mode network of constant inner chatter, what it still goes on, but you detach

35:34.800 --> 35:40.800
from it and you just let it pass and so on. So that's like I think like breathing in, whereas

35:40.800 --> 35:47.360
prayer I experience in is almost the opposite direction, petitionary prayer. You start with

35:47.360 --> 35:53.600
an invocation or prayers start with an invocation, our Father who art in heaven, Hail Mary full of

35:53.600 --> 36:02.480
grace, Om Nomah Shivaya, O Allah. You start with an invocation to being graced in yourself, a form

36:02.480 --> 36:08.400
of consciousness graced in yourself. And then in petitionary prayer, we're asking for things which

36:08.400 --> 36:14.320
is the most common or common or garden form of prayer, I mean basic found all over the world in

36:14.320 --> 36:21.440
all different traditions. You then direct intention towards things that in the outer world,

36:21.920 --> 36:29.520
someone who's sick, a problem that you're worried about, some threat you want to pray for protection

36:29.520 --> 36:36.880
or defense. So it's very practical about the affairs of everyday life and the immediate

36:36.880 --> 36:41.840
problems in one's life. So in that sense, it's like breathing out, it's going from a spiritual

36:41.840 --> 36:49.360
center towards the outer world, towards actual particular problems. And so I see these as both

36:49.920 --> 36:55.280
ways. I see them as complementary to each other and breathing in and breathing out metaphor

36:56.480 --> 37:02.240
is shows I mean, we can only breathe out because we breathe in and vice versa. So

37:03.360 --> 37:10.320
have the flow in both directions. But these are a way of coming to a center within one's

37:10.320 --> 37:16.560
self where one's consciousness is connected to or one can sometimes experience this connection

37:16.560 --> 37:23.440
to a greater ground of being or consciousness. And then praying is connecting that center to

37:24.640 --> 37:30.320
the affairs of the world. Both of these increase the sense of porosity, the idea that one's

37:30.320 --> 37:35.200
consciousness is related to something greater. And also that the everyday affairs that one's

37:35.200 --> 37:41.280
concerned with and the problems in the world and hopes and fears and all that are related to

37:41.280 --> 37:47.200
something greater than oneself as well. And I think that everyone who prays and it's in if you

37:47.200 --> 37:52.880
take the whole world, most people pray, even if you take Britain, far more people pray than

37:54.240 --> 38:00.320
actually go to church or have regular religious practices. I think these are ways in which on

38:00.320 --> 38:06.720
an everyday basis, we have a greater sense of this connection. Well, I like very much that image of

38:06.720 --> 38:14.320
breathing in and breathing out naturally. And I don't, I don't in any way deny your experience, but

38:15.120 --> 38:23.920
I'm also immediately reminded of St Francis's admonition that when you pray, you should ask for

38:23.920 --> 38:30.880
nothing, nothing. He's very emphatic about it. I think Mother Teresa said much of the same thing.

38:31.520 --> 38:38.320
And I remember the words of the infant Samuel, was it speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

38:38.320 --> 38:43.760
When the one's praying, it's more about listening than talking. But it doesn't mean that one doesn't

38:43.760 --> 38:52.960
remember people that one cares for and cares about. It would be odd and counter-intuitive

38:53.840 --> 39:03.520
to do that. So I think one bears them in one's mind, in one's care, and one commends that to God.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.080
If one asks for anything, one has to, after all, couch that with the words, you know,

39:12.800 --> 39:22.640
if it so be your will. I do ask for things, I suppose, but I'm slightly conflicted about it.

39:22.640 --> 39:27.440
I think that the greater part of praying is actually creating a space in which something

39:27.440 --> 39:33.200
can come to you. Indeed, I think all creation and imagination is not about going out

39:34.000 --> 39:40.320
and doing something, but about creating a space for something to happen.

39:41.760 --> 39:48.720
As I often say, a gardener can't make a plant. All the gardener can do is create, create a space

39:48.720 --> 39:54.640
for the plant to flourish or stifle the plant, but the plant has its own existence. And I think

39:54.640 --> 40:02.160
that whatever the spirit, the divine spirit is trying to bring to us, we crowd out with our own

40:04.000 --> 40:13.040
desires, our own wishes, our own formulations, and that being open is about creating a space

40:13.040 --> 40:20.560
for things to happen. I'm going to just mention here this extraordinary notion of the creation

40:21.200 --> 40:25.840
that comes from the Lurianic cabala, the prime being, the ground of being aims off.

40:27.040 --> 40:35.120
Being relational, as God is and as love is, needs a creation to return that love, to be

40:35.120 --> 40:40.480
the object of that love, and to realize the relationship with the loved one, which must

40:40.480 --> 40:46.800
be free. And so what is the first act of aims off in creation? It's something called sim sum,

40:46.800 --> 40:52.240
which means withdrawal, and that is a withdrawal to make a space in which there can be something other

40:52.240 --> 41:04.480
than this creature, this ground of being, not a creature. And then there are 12 of them that are

41:04.480 --> 41:09.760
in this space to catch whatever it is that comes out of aims off. The single spark of fire comes

41:09.840 --> 41:16.400
out of aims off and lands on these vessels and shatters most of them. And the third

41:16.400 --> 41:23.520
act of creation is called tikkun, which means repair. And this is the particular

41:24.960 --> 41:33.040
honor, duty, purpose indeed of humanity is to repair these shattered vessels and to make

41:33.040 --> 41:40.800
them more beautiful than they were before. And in that image, I think of this Japanese

41:40.800 --> 41:46.480
art of ceramics called kintsugi, in which you repair a shattered vessel, but it's more beautiful

41:46.480 --> 41:53.920
than it was before, often repaired with lines of guilt or gold that come into the ceramics.

41:53.920 --> 42:00.560
So this idea of creating a space for things to happen, drawing back and being unknowing and

42:00.560 --> 42:07.520
undoing is, I think, very important. Well, personally, I see that as more the role of

42:07.520 --> 42:13.360
meditation. I mean, there are various forms of prayer. Contemplative prayer or meditation

42:13.360 --> 42:21.360
is creating a space. I'm meditating quite often. I mean, I'm not meditating in order to have sort

42:21.360 --> 42:28.240
of ideas, but quite often, ideas pop into my mind about things of work I'm doing, ideas,

42:28.240 --> 42:34.240
scientific experiments and so forth. But petitionary prayer, I mean, there's an amazing

42:34.240 --> 42:39.040
range of opinions. I used to belong to a group called the epiphany philosophers in Cambridge,

42:39.600 --> 42:46.640
and we had retreats together. We had Easter vigils and we had masses at various times of the year,

42:46.640 --> 42:53.280
which the priests who celebrated them for us at one stage was Ron Williams, who is a member of

42:53.280 --> 43:01.680
this group. And once I was thinking about prayer, and we prayed together, we did matins and even

43:01.680 --> 43:08.480
song every day together when we were on retreats. And I then said, well, could we go around the

43:08.480 --> 43:13.760
circle? We all knew each other very well, and just say something about how we ourselves prayed.

43:14.560 --> 43:21.040
And it was astonishing. I had just no idea these people I prayed with many times saw it say

43:21.040 --> 43:26.400
differently. Some thought that we shouldn't ever pray for anything specific, a bit like you,

43:26.400 --> 43:30.720
you know, could hold people before God and or hold them in the light of God, but not

43:30.720 --> 43:37.840
tell God what to do because God already knew everything. So absolutely not right to do that.

43:38.640 --> 43:45.120
Others prayed very, very specifically, as Jesus does in the New Testament, and Jesus is not just

43:45.120 --> 43:50.560
holding people specifically, caring specific people. He didn't care everybody when he walked

43:50.560 --> 43:57.920
into the room, he'd care one person at a time with a particular personal sort of act of healing.

43:59.200 --> 44:07.280
So it was much, it was really quite specific. And so there was a wide range of opinion about

44:07.280 --> 44:13.200
how specific we should be. And those who believed in the specificity would say it's not telling God

44:13.200 --> 44:19.360
what to do, it's being co-creators with the divine that God works through us. An idea similar to what

44:19.360 --> 44:25.600
you just said God works through us. And he asked for God's guidance in our prayers. You're not just

44:25.600 --> 44:32.080
coming up with ideas, I want to have a new car or I'd like to have more money or something like that.

44:33.200 --> 44:40.160
It's not like God in prayer is like celestial Amazon with delivery next day.

44:40.720 --> 44:49.840
Yes. I remember a joke about that. I prayed for a new bicycle, but then I realized God doesn't

44:49.840 --> 45:02.480
work like that. So I stole a bicycle and prayed for forgiveness. But I do, you see, I'm trying to hold

45:02.560 --> 45:10.240
together two uncertainties, which is always my problem. I really respect what you're saying.

45:10.800 --> 45:16.560
And of course, whether you call it prayer that caused Christ to heal people or something else,

45:16.560 --> 45:22.400
I don't know. But the C.S. Lewis pointed out the idea that prayer will produce the outcome we desire

45:22.400 --> 45:28.960
can be completely dispensary because the holiest of all petitioners in the Garden of Gethsemane

45:28.960 --> 45:34.640
prayed three times for this cup to be taken from him and it simply wasn't. So we can

45:36.160 --> 45:42.480
assume that this is not the way that prayer does work. Having said that, I believe that

45:43.440 --> 45:49.440
disposing one's mind towards an outcome and disposing many people's minds towards an outcome

45:50.000 --> 45:56.880
may help that outcome come about. I don't know quite how and it may be by modes that you're

45:56.880 --> 46:04.720
more articulate about that we call parapsychological but are probably entirely natural.

46:06.480 --> 46:13.840
Yes. I think forming the intention you see is part of this co-creation. And I think the power of

46:13.840 --> 46:18.640
praying together. I'm a regular church girl because I like praying together. I like singing

46:18.640 --> 46:25.440
together and I like being in a holy place with members of the community who pray together. So

46:25.520 --> 46:30.880
I go wherever I am on Sundays and small village churches on local parish church here in Hampstead

46:30.880 --> 46:36.800
or wherever I am. So I think that creating an intention together is very, very important.

46:38.160 --> 46:45.360
And of course the secularized version of prayer and intention is positive thinking

46:45.360 --> 46:51.360
which is huge in America. For a hundred years or more there have been all these books on

46:51.360 --> 46:59.280
the power of positive thinking. Where you form an intention and then to sell more vacuum cleaners

46:59.280 --> 47:08.240
or icopedios and then you sell more because you form the intention. And one of the most perverse

47:08.240 --> 47:14.720
examples of positive thinking is of course the former president Donald Trump who was raised in

47:14.720 --> 47:22.640
the church of positive thinking. The chap who was the prophet of positive thinking what's he

47:22.640 --> 47:28.640
called Norman. I've forgotten the name for the moment but the power of positive thinking.

47:28.640 --> 47:32.880
I don't have anything to do with these pop psychologists. Norman Vincent Peale.

47:32.880 --> 47:38.320
Oh yes, Norman Vincent Peale. That's right. I did. You know the power of positive thinking.

47:38.320 --> 47:43.600
He was the minister of something called the Marble Church in Manhattan where Trump's family went

47:43.600 --> 47:50.800
and as a teenager Trump imbibed all this. So Norman Vincent Peale married him to his first wife.

47:50.800 --> 47:55.840
So he was absolutely raised in formative on positive thinking and the idea is you just

47:55.840 --> 48:00.320
say something and you can make it come true through power of intention. So he loses the

48:00.320 --> 48:05.360
election so he says he's won it. You know this is pure positive thinking taken to its most

48:07.040 --> 48:11.120
In my terms it's pure left hemisphere thinking because the left hemisphere

48:11.120 --> 48:15.600
and believes that it has power to create the outcome at once and there's always an optimism

48:15.600 --> 48:22.480
optimism and if something doesn't work out the way it believes it will deny that black is black.

48:22.480 --> 48:31.440
It will say a paralyzed limb is such that they can use it freely and so it's power to deny

48:31.440 --> 48:37.040
reality in order to fit in with its theory about reality is the defining feature of it

48:37.040 --> 48:43.600
and I would say that you know Trumpism is just an expression of this mentality and not one that I

48:43.600 --> 48:50.480
particularly want to take as my guide. Oh I certainly don't. The point about it is you see

48:50.480 --> 48:57.760
that it's a kind of debased or secularized form. Yes I know what you're saying. It's about getting

48:57.760 --> 49:04.080
what you want through positive thinking. You have success in love and business through positive

49:04.080 --> 49:08.480
thinking. That's why these books sell so well. You know they're all about selling more of the

49:08.480 --> 49:15.520
product and getting ahead and so forth and the basic principle that forming intentions can

49:15.520 --> 49:21.680
actually have effects in the world but the point about proper prayer positive things about me

49:21.680 --> 49:27.440
getting what I want through the power of my mind and that's where the left hemisphere goes magical

49:27.520 --> 49:36.160
as it were or attempts to. Whereas the normal prayer I mean I myself being Christian always

49:36.160 --> 49:40.240
start my prayers with the Lord's Prayer and part of that is right at the beginning is

49:40.240 --> 49:46.480
Thy will be done so it's a prayer in a much as you were mentioning into a much larger context

49:46.480 --> 49:53.760
of God's will and the larger purposes of which I'm a part and I play a part within that larger

49:53.760 --> 49:59.680
pattern but if you and I suppose that would be more like a right hemisphere thing because it's

49:59.680 --> 50:05.440
part of a global vision of what's happening in the world but then you could say the secularization

50:05.440 --> 50:12.960
of prayer as it removes the right hemisphere aspect until it becomes left hemisphere activity

50:12.960 --> 50:17.600
but I think positive thinking can't be understood as a movement or a practice

50:17.600 --> 50:24.080
without its background in petitionary prayer from which it's kind of truncated derivative.

50:25.120 --> 50:30.560
Yes no I think that's fine I don't think we need to to disagree too much about this

50:32.720 --> 50:39.120
I mean I suppose that the touchstone for me is the is the holocaust I mean all these innocent

50:39.120 --> 50:45.360
people and innocent children treated with utmost barbarity and you suppose that

50:45.360 --> 50:52.800
the decent people, Jews, Christians and others did not pray that they should be spared this but

50:52.800 --> 51:01.120
they weren't so you know that that is a I can I can there is a theodicy I think which is simply that

51:02.640 --> 51:08.080
whatever God is God has to allow his creation freedom otherwise it's simply an extension

51:08.080 --> 51:15.040
of himself and it's not another that he can love it is not a creation so that that creation

51:15.040 --> 51:23.360
must have the freedom to do good or ill and unfortunately a lot of time we do evil.

51:24.480 --> 51:32.240
Anyway let's talk about many other things as the walrus said what should we move to

51:32.240 --> 51:36.880
panpsychism or would you like to talk about consciousness and matter or the nature of

51:36.880 --> 51:46.320
time or where should we go? Well I think while we're on consciousness and I think one the view

51:46.320 --> 51:50.880
that you started with you know our present bottom-up view I mean the traditional view is

51:50.880 --> 51:56.880
the opposite that starts with consciousness that consciousness underlies all things

51:58.240 --> 52:06.480
and then the whole of nature is produced through consciousness in the christian version

52:06.560 --> 52:10.800
in the creed it says the cosmic christ you know through him all things were made

52:11.600 --> 52:17.600
that there's a part of the divine the second person of the holy trinity the logast which is

52:17.600 --> 52:25.440
the realm of names and forms it's through all creation is divinely or comes forth from an

52:25.440 --> 52:31.440
ultimate source of form and structure that everything in that sense shares within the

52:31.520 --> 52:39.040
divine consciousness god is in nature nature is in god and that is not panpsychism but

52:39.040 --> 52:46.160
panentheism the idea that god is everywhere in nature and that nature is in god so god is

52:46.160 --> 52:54.640
the mind of god transcends nature it's not just nature because of pantheism and so I think what

52:54.640 --> 53:02.160
we've got at the moment now coming to panpsychism is the this the main driver for modern panpsychism

53:02.160 --> 53:07.120
is to try and as you said to solve the hard problem because the hard problem is that if you

53:07.120 --> 53:11.840
have a materialist view that the whole world is made up of unconsciousness or nothing else

53:12.800 --> 53:18.640
there's no consciousness out there the only consciousness there is is inside brains and

53:19.360 --> 53:25.840
moreover the maximum amounts inside human brains and maybe lesser amounts in dog brains and

53:25.840 --> 53:34.080
elephant brains and perhaps tiny amounts in worm brains or ant brains that that consciousness

53:34.080 --> 53:40.000
is confined to brains the entire universe is unconscious except on this planet and it's

53:40.000 --> 53:46.000
unconscious on the entire planet except for the inside of human and animal heads that's the standard

53:46.080 --> 53:51.520
view but it has the problem then of saying well if the whole universe is unconscious mass

53:51.520 --> 53:56.640
unconscious how come we're conscious everything ought to be unconscious and then as you know

53:56.640 --> 54:01.840
a lot of philosophers of mind of a materialist persuasion try to pretend we're not conscious

54:01.840 --> 54:07.840
it's an illusion it doesn't do anything that's a happy phenomenon ridiculous yes let's try and

54:07.840 --> 54:13.600
get rid of consciousness no so the panpsychist so you know the bright boy at the back of the class

54:13.600 --> 54:18.800
and among materialist philosophers of mind said well what if have we say electrons and atoms are

54:18.800 --> 54:23.840
a bit conscious then and we can explain our consciousness there's a difference of degree

54:23.840 --> 54:30.800
not of kind but they usually end there once they get to the human brain they think they've made

54:30.800 --> 54:36.320
their point and that's where panpsychism ends but as you know i've tried to carry this argument

54:36.320 --> 54:41.120
further in in my paper in the journal of consciousness studies is the silent conscious

54:41.840 --> 54:47.760
i tried to go with this panpsychist move and say okay well let's say that there really is this

54:47.760 --> 54:54.720
kind of panpsychism then why stop at the human brain the sun is self-organizing system vastly

54:54.720 --> 55:00.080
larger than our brains with vastly more complex electromagnetic patterns why can't the sun be

55:00.080 --> 55:05.200
conscious why can't other stars be conscious and indeed whole galaxies with higher levels of

55:05.200 --> 55:12.640
consciousness and then clusters of galaxies and then the entire cosmos and of course this is not a

55:12.640 --> 55:21.280
new idea then Plato and platinus and many others talked about the world soul the the whole universe

55:21.280 --> 55:27.600
having a kind of soul mind or organizing principle and that would be a kind of pantheistic

55:28.720 --> 55:34.400
global consciousness but then the traditional view is that that itself has embedded within the larger

55:35.520 --> 55:40.160
more inclusive source of consciousness which is in the end the source of nature

55:40.160 --> 55:46.480
but so panpsychism as we currently have it is a fairly limited form of panpsychism it's a kind

55:46.480 --> 55:53.760
of materialist panpsychism which just attributes kind of epiphenomenal consciousness to material

55:53.760 --> 56:02.800
structures up to indicating the human brain yes yes well as you possibly know i'm a panentist

56:02.800 --> 56:09.200
and it's a very different thing from being a pantheist but there is a way in fact of

56:10.160 --> 56:19.200
approaching what is meant by panpsychism further towards panentism and almost making it

56:20.640 --> 56:27.680
making them a union if you start from the idea that there is separate stuff in the realm of

56:27.680 --> 56:34.160
matter and that you've got to find a union to it then you have this famous combination problem

56:34.160 --> 56:44.480
but if you start from the view as i do that the promptly the ontological primitive is consciousness

56:44.480 --> 56:51.360
there is nothing you can get beyond or behind you can't go beyond or behind consciousness

56:51.360 --> 56:58.800
consciousness is the ultimate reality i was asked yesterday by clergy well is consciousness god and

56:58.800 --> 57:06.880
i suppose yes but no because i don't want to sort of limit what god is rather in the panentistic

57:06.880 --> 57:16.560
way consciousness is a divine creation but what i see is that matter is a mode of manifestation of

57:16.560 --> 57:28.160
consciousness so at times it is it is something that is immaterial or appears to be but we only

57:28.160 --> 57:34.480
know what we call material things because we have consciousness we don't know that we have

57:34.480 --> 57:39.040
consciousness because of material things such as brains but we do know the one thing where

57:39.040 --> 57:45.120
can be certain of his consciousness which is why it's so particularly annoying that people

57:46.240 --> 57:52.160
are sitting on well-paid and prestigious chairs in american universities claiming that consciousness

57:52.160 --> 57:58.800
is an illusion but anyway and consciousness is the basic reality and people say well matter

57:58.800 --> 58:04.240
doesn't look like consciousness but then i suggest that we think about it as a phase of it in the way

58:04.240 --> 58:10.800
that ice is a phase of water you know water is translucent and flowing and so forth but ice is

58:10.800 --> 58:18.160
is static and opaque and extremely hard and so hard it can split your head open and in this room

58:18.160 --> 58:23.520
there is a a tunnel more of of water in the atmosphere otherwise i couldn't breathe so

58:23.520 --> 58:27.760
they don't look like one another but which is the real water they're all real water and i think the

58:28.400 --> 58:37.120
there are all these ways in which consciousness can manifest and one of them is in what we call

58:37.120 --> 58:42.480
matter and why should there be matter well i suggest there's matter because it provides

58:42.480 --> 58:52.720
two important things for creation it provides importantly an element of resistance nothing

58:52.720 --> 59:00.480
can come into existence without there being some element of resistance or something that moves

59:01.360 --> 59:08.880
against that that trend of of creation i mean you know everything has this dual aspect you

59:09.840 --> 59:14.480
what is friction friction stops movement certainly but it also starts movement without friction you

59:14.480 --> 59:22.080
can't move and without there being some definition which means literally the the limits to things

59:22.080 --> 59:28.320
that can't be the whole world that we experience with all its magical beauty and complexity so it

59:28.320 --> 59:35.440
brings that degree of of a resistance and it brings a degree of temporary permanence in other

59:35.440 --> 59:42.480
words the things i'm saying disappear as soon as i say them may linger in somebody's mind somewhere

59:42.480 --> 59:47.680
for a few seconds but you know the desk at which i'm sitting will be here tomorrow absent a world

59:48.240 --> 59:55.760
so those are the ways i would see it and that is completely constant with what you were saying

59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.720
about the divine being what you're really saying is the divine is imminent and the

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:06.160
divine is transcendent and it's holding those two together which we can in the form of the trinity

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:12.320
trinity the trinity is the best explanation of panentism that there is you know it's like the

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:19.120
image of a book what is a book is it the thing in the mind of the creator or is it the the volume

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:23.920
here on the table or is it what happens when that volume is taken up and read by somebody

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:30.320
the book is all three of those but in different senses and this is what roomy said in one of his

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:41.120
meditation the spirit is the well spring it is the cup that conveys the water and it is the water

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.480
that quenches the thirst of those who are thirsty so i just thought i'd throw that in because i think

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:54.160
it's one way of making panpsychism a much more interesting phenomenon a much closer to panentism

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:02.400
i agree i i think that the best model of ultimate reality is trinitarian and we find it in many

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:08.400
different traditions as my favorite book on this is david bentley hart's book the experience of god

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:17.120
being is bliss where he shows that the an indian model sat chit ananda is is one way of looking

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:23.040
at this and sat is the ground of all being that which sustains all things all being and chit is

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:30.400
consciousness which is contains names and forms namarupa names and forms that the contents of

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:36.160
consciousness has is consciousness about things and these names and forms it's roughly what play

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:42.560
to call you know the platonic realm of ideas in the christian trinity is the logos and then

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:49.120
ananda joy or bliss that the divine consciousness is blissful which is why mystical experiences of

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:55.440
union with god are usually blissful because the divine consciousness is blissful now in the christian

01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:01.600
model where we have god the father is the ground of being and the logos as the the second person

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:08.480
the trinity the names and forms which give form shape structure coherence to everything which

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:14.240
underlie the order and form of the world and also the order and form of our minds which is why we

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:20.320
can the traditional view is why we can understand nature is because they have a common source their

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:26.720
minds and the natural world and then the holy spirit which is the dynamical moving principle

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:33.600
wind energy breath flames flying birds you know it's the dynamical principle

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:43.840
i find that the when we understand matter as a combination of form and energy with energy

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:50.480
according to physics matter like an electron or a proton or an atom are organized by quantum fields

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:56.320
which give form the energy within them is the same energy we see in light and light can turn

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.360
into matter and matter can turn into light energy is promiscuous and can take any form

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.960
so what we have in nature is a universal energy this is a scientific view as well as a religious

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:17.520
view and we have a whole range of possible forms that energy can take and the source of both

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:25.040
energy is is the ultimate being and the source of both and the primary metaphor is of course

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:31.760
speaking because when i speak i'm the speaker the words i'm saying have formed structure shape

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:38.000
connection with each other meaning and but in order to say them i have to be breathing up there

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:45.200
has to be a flow of air and if i have just the words they're silent in my mind if i have just

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:53.760
the flow of air it's a kind of white noise of undifferentiated energy but the two together

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.800
make the words which can then relate and communicate and give structure and meaning

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:04.960
so i think that this metaphor i find this particular metaphor of the holy trinity particularly

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:11.760
helpful yes yes well i'm glad i i would endorse every word of that but i thought that we might

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.600
segue from there to the relationship between energy and matter we know that they're interchangeable

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:26.000
and e equals mc squared is a the most famous expression of this idea and i'm i'm very interested

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:36.960
in your idea which i believe will be adopted by mainstream science eventually when they catch up

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:44.000
which is that there are form fields of energy possibly electromagnetic energy which govern

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:54.400
the shapes of things and are also the cause of memory so there are memories that are stored

01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:01.440
in form fields i believe this this is something that you would you might want to

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:08.640
demur but i think this is my understanding um because of course i mean i'm sure people are

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.560
aware but when we we've done this heroic task of decoding the genome you know which i don't want to

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:23.280
diminish in any way it was a staggeringly um clever and and and some brilliant piece of work

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.120
but at the end of the day what we discovered this is almost nothing there i mean there's

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:34.000
absolutely there's not just not quite enough information as but by many many orders of magnitude

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.080
far far too little most things are just simply not there and it reminds me slightly of that

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:46.000
episode of faulty towers i think it's number five of the first series where um the chef gets drunk

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.200
and um basal faulty has to go off to a restaurant and and get a duck for the for the gala evening

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.520
and unfortunately somebody switches the the plates around and so he takes away what he

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:03.200
believes is a duck but is in fact a blamance and he walks into the dining room with this sort of

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:10.000
i've got it here now and then he goes voila takes off of it and there's a blamance and he goes

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:19.840
nothing there and i i sort of see this as the state we're in now that we we thought we've got it

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:26.800
but actually it's not there so on a more serious note you you sent me a couple of papers that i very

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:32.160
much enjoyed um one of them was fairly technical but it explained itself at the end and what it was

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:40.800
really saying is at the lowest level of neurons and uh transmitters and so on there is no stability

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:47.120
or there is little stability not enough stability to say that any kind of memory is stored in this

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.320
pattern of neurons or whatever because it shifts it shifts in the brain after very short while it

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:59.440
may go somewhere else so but what is stable is not the manifestation in the brain substance

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:03.840
but some kind of electromagnetic field now expand on that Rupert please

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:14.880
well and i think both genes and uh brains have long been overrated um and in in the in the 1970s

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:20.480
and 80s these human genes would explain everything which is why literally billions of dollars were

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:26.240
poured into the human genome project as you say when it came when it finished you know they thought

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.880
there'd be a hundred thousand genes that you'd be able to patent them and make fortune and stuff

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:38.480
there are only 20,000 and you know rice plants have about 45,000 and see a few more than us so

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:45.120
it's not it's not it wasn't at all what was expected and then all these attempts to explain

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:51.520
hereditary in genome-wide association studies we compare tens of thousands of people's genomes

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:56.240
and they look at their height and where they get breast cancer where they you know schizophrenia

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:02.800
etc what do the genes actually explain well they explain about 2.5 percent of the inheritance of

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:08.240
schizophrenia less than 10 percent of the inheritance of breast cancer less than 20 percent of the

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:15.440
inheritance of height and yet these things are known to be heritable and so the genes don't

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:23.520
explain it so that's called the missing heritability problem in the trade and they try people have

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:28.560
tried to fill that gap with epigenetics the inheritance of quiet characters which was as

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:34.480
you know taboo in the 20th century absolutely I think it depends on morphic resonance the

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:42.080
connection of the kind of memory across time as you know is one of my favorite theories

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:49.360
and the same goes for memories in the brain that morphic resonance depends on similarity

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.880
any organism is more similar to itself in the past than to any other organism

01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:00.480
therefore the most specific resonance is from its own past I think this maintains the form

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.760
of organisms even though the cells and the molecules turn over I mean our own molecules

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:12.880
are changing time and cells coming and going but the form remains more or less the same

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:18.320
and in the realm of memory I think that we resonate with ourselves in the past and that's how memory

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:25.120
works that it's not stored as the materialists believe they have to believe that it's material

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.680
in the brain because they've got nothing but material to explain things and so it has to be

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:35.520
material traces and people have tried over and over and over again for more than a hundred years to

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:41.360
find these memory traces storing memories in brains and they've proved ever more elusive

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.960
and the paper you were referring to is where people have looked in mouse brains

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:52.480
inserting extremely detailed electrodes so you can get tremendously fine grain picture of what's

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.840
happening in the in the brain and we know that brains have waves going through them it's not

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:03.680
just granular nerve cell activity it's we've known from electroencephalographs for years that there

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:10.240
are global wave patterns what this new study shows is that these wave patterns are highly specific

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.080
and very particular patterns of waves when a mouse learns something and when it remembers it

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.800
and when they first discovered the characteristic wave patterns they said oh we've located the

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:27.280
memory here they are these waves in this bit of the brain that in between when learning and remembering

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:32.640
they must have been stored in the cells in material traces that somehow then come to life in the form

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:38.800
of waves again but then they found that the wave patterns remain the same when they remember it

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:44.800
the same pattern but the pattern can move to different bits of the brain it it's it's not

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:50.400
in particular cells it's it's the ability of the nervous tissue to produce wave patterns that

01:10:50.400 --> 01:11:00.240
underlies the memory and this is called representational drift so the standard theory of memory

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:05.440
just doesn't work and I think memory and the memory of form and the inheritance of form and

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:10.640
instinct I think instincts like habits of the species inherited by morphic resonance

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:17.840
um so I think that the the the standard materialist view trying to build it all up from granular

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:27.040
genes is simply falling apart through you know the um the inheritance problem um

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:31.680
the missing heritability problem and through things like representational drift and the

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:39.680
failure to find memories in the brain this of course has huge implications for consciousness

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:45.280
because the materialist view is that when we die if memories are all stored in the brain and the

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:52.480
brain decays then oblivion is the only possible outcome of death whereas all traditional belief

01:11:52.480 --> 01:12:00.080
systems have had some sort of life after death whether it's a shadowy ancestral realm in Hades

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:07.200
or whether it's you know life after death or whether it's reincarnation all of them involve

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:13.520
a transfer or survival of memory beyond the survive beyond the death of the brain all of those

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:18.720
possibilities are ruled out by the materialist theory which is why it so fits well with kind

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:26.080
of atheist worldview um because it rules out a lot of religion is about thinking about consciousness

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:32.640
in a big picture including the possibility of life after death or whether it's our consciousness

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:40.640
resorbed into the ultimate consciousness or whatever um it they all assume most religions

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:46.000
assume that it doesn't just stop when we die whereas the materialist theory of memory says

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:54.080
that's the only possible option quite quite but am i right in understanding i mean i know you like

01:12:54.080 --> 01:13:00.960
myself have had conversations with michael levin who is an evolutionary biologist at Tufts

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:08.160
um i think you've had conversations with him am i right yes yes i went to visit him actually i

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:15.840
admired him a few years ago when i was giving a talk at harvard i i went to um to visit him

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:22.080
and we we spent some time together in his lab and that was a purely private conversation but

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:29.600
did you find that there was um that he had moved towards i my sense is that he doesn't

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:35.120
actually want to embrace it fully or publicly but that he basically is a deeply sympathetic to

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:42.080
this way of thinking yes he is his his whole way of thinking is about holistic organizing

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:50.640
principles which are more for genetic fields that's my starting point um he's the the great

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:56.240
thrust of his work is that biology is organized by fields sort of top-down organization of the

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:02.560
development generation rather than building it up from the bottom from genes which simply doesn't

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:11.680
work no but there's a form of teleology or passive behavior in all living things that there's a

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:17.680
global organizing principles that are hierarchically organized and you've got cells within tissues

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:23.600
the cell has its own form of organization its own intelligence and the tissue containing millions

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:29.920
of cells as a higher level of organization and the organ a higher level still in the organism

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:37.280
and the society but this view is almost i mean it's very similar to what i i think and the one

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:43.040
thing he doesn't have is morphic resonance you see and um i he certainly knows about it because

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:48.480
when i went to visit him he pulled out a very well in thumb copy of my book a new science of life

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:54.800
my first about morphic resonance he asked me to sign it and and i know he's read it with great

01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.560
attention and yes i mean he's very widely read i don't claim that i'm special privilege particularly

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:07.440
for me but or my book but um he's very widely read but he's certainly very aware of the holistic

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:13.840
tradition in biology very rooted in it and very very well aware of his history um you know going

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:22.320
back to the early 20th century people like greech and and the school i mean he's very aware of that

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:28.960
in a way that most biologists aren't and i think that he's hovering i think he'd love morphic

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:35.760
resonance to be true but he doesn't mention it he doesn't talk about it he doesn't do research on it

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:44.080
because he knows that this would mean he's at present has a very influential position within

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:50.320
biology it's he's very rare uh it's very rare for someone who has a holistic perspective to have such

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:58.080
wide influence in where molecular biology has dominated things for so long if he's started coming

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:05.120
out in favor of morphic resonance you know he'd be proclaimed a heretic like me and and this would

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:11.600
fall apart so if somebody else got good evidence for morphic resonance i think he'd be pleased and

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:16.480
i think he'd start doing work on it but i think he's in a position where he could take the lead

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:25.440
yes uh while you were talking about this intelligence of cells you know which is

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:31.680
something i'm very interested in i've written about in the matter with things um even a single cell

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:40.480
can inventively repair its own form although it's not programmed any rare in its genome to do so

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:48.160
and has no experience itself of such a repair being needed and in many ways that's a small

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:56.000
element in a picture which is much bigger which is in a good point that i think was made by um

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:04.800
fsc schiller or fcs schiller uh which is that when somebody's had a brain injury

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.600
how is it that other parts of the brain sort of know that they need to reconstitute this element

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:16.640
it is entirely different from anything that the machine can do because it involves a

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:21.680
conceptual pattern of the whole where it recognizes there's something that needs to be brought into being

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:27.680
rather like the idea of a representational drift there's another part of them on a much

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:31.760
bigger scale and more dramatically that one another area of the brain must be recruited

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:37.200
to do this job and that suggests that there is a form of what is going on at a higher level

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:44.960
which is exactly what they're finding in in the brain science of memory that you are talking about

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:53.680
so i think that's that's wonderful now that's why in the 1920s when the idea of morphogenetic

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:59.680
fields was first put forward people liked the field idea because if there's a field organizing

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:06.000
the development of an organism or a cell and if you damage it the field is still there which contains

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:15.040
wholeness and can account for regeneration and the analogy was with magnetic fields because

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.880
fields are intrinsically holistic even the fields of physics and after all fields were

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:27.280
only introduced into science by faraday in the 19th century in the 1850s before that it was

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:33.360
just purely mechanistic no pushing and pulling billiard balls and things although newton's

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:41.040
gravitational theory implied interconnectedness of the entire universe but the emphasis in classical

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:46.640
mechanics was on pushing and pulling and fields in a way are still involved in pushing and pulling

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:52.400
but um that they're through what i'm pulling than pushing i make a distinction i think the

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:57.840
things that push from behind are very mechanistic and hydraulic but that actually what we need to

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:03.200
be thinking about are those things both spiritually morally intellectually and biologically that draw

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:09.440
us from in front well yes of course magnetic fields push or pull if you put the same poles

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:14.960
together yes that's true but it's not symmetrical because if you shake up a whole lot of magnets

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:21.680
i sometimes do this for fun um they they automatically line up they repel each other

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:28.160
until they pull and so it's not that repulsion attraction comes out above repulsion because

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:35.040
you end up with interconnected magnet you don't end up with lots of repelled separate ones so

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:40.880
of course i love that they're repulsion and attraction are symmetrical in in an iron magnet

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:48.640
the rhythm is the domination of attraction and that sounds a very good point which to

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.000
um have a break

01:19:54.800 --> 01:20:00.720
i have to sort of cut you off somewhere um because the conversation has been so wide

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:05.360
ranging and fascinating that you brought things out of each other um which is probably

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:10.240
you know new and fresh and that's what i think is so exciting about a dialogue

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:13.840
and where you have a creative interchange
