1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,120
and welcome everyone. My brother-in-law Alastair McWhorter once wrote a short story where he said

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,040
the boys got up earlier than anyone has ever got up before, and that seems to apply to

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,120
some of our dedicated attenders from the US. I'm going to light a candle first before I say

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:43,440
anything else. And I've got a match that works today. Yes, there we are. Good. So a warm welcome

5
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,840
to this dialogue with Rupert Sheldrake and Ian McGilkerist. I've known Ian and Rupert for over

6
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:01,520
40 years. And so our connection goes back a long way. And I'd like to start with just a remark or two

7
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:10,240
on reading. And this comes from the obituary this week in the Telegraph of John Thorne, who was headmaster

8
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,400
of Winchester when I was teaching there and when Ian was a pupil. And in 1981, he was chairman of

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:26,160
the Headmaster's Conference. And he said, I do see a cloud bigger than a man's hand in the decline

10
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,720
of reading, he told HMC. If it is not done at school, it may never be done. And I think this

11
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,280
is a prophetic remark. And at Winchester, there's something called the DIV system, which is a

12
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,360
general studies where the don, the teacher, has a lot of latitude in what is read.

13
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:54,400
And while Ian was at Winchester, one of the books he read at the recommendation of his housemaster

14
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:01,040
was William James's Varieties of Religious Experience, which is a seminal book of Gifford

15
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:10,080
Lectures in Edinburgh, 1901, 1902. And so Ian read this when he was probably about 16.

16
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,560
Rupert didn't get around to reading it until quite a bit later. And just yesterday, I'd been

17
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,000
corresponding with a former pupil who was also a scholar at Winchester, Professor Ben Morrison.

18
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,080
And Ben is now the chair of philosophy at Princeton. And my first encounter with him

19
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,920
was that Simon Elliott, one of my friends who was a don as well, he sent him round with a six-page

20
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:44,640
essay aged 14 entitled, Does God Exist? And he went through the usual arguments. And so I pointed

21
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,640
him in the direction of William James and lent him a copy of Varieties of Religious Experience,

22
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,800
which he proceeded to read. And then we discussed it. And then Rupert appeared first in my

23
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,840
horizon, as it were, at Mystics and Scientists in 1983, when I was teaching at Winchester.

24
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
And he was lecturing on his then new book or new-ish book, A New Science of Life.

25
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,480
And I gave him a spare copy of this book here, which is called Talks to Teacher on Psychology

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,360
and to Students on Some of Life's Ideals by William James, which I'm sure is still somewhere in

27
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,640
Rupert's library. And then finally, this book here is incredibly important. It's called Human

28
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:42,400
Immortality. And it's the Ingersoll Lecture on Immortality, 1898, at Harvard University. And

29
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,880
just to start, Ian and Rupert, off, I'm going to read a couple of short passages from the

30
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:57,600
inclusion of Varieties of Religious Experience. And this is my paperback copy. I read it when

31
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:06,560
I was 26. And I remember reading part of it in the Beautiful Gardens in Marburg. So he says,

32
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,640
summing up in the broadest possible way the characteristics of the religious life as we

33
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:18,160
have found them, it includes the following beliefs. One, that the visible world is part of a more

34
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,960
spiritual universe from which it draws its chief significance. Two, that union or harmonious

35
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,240
relation with that higher universe is our true end. Three, that prayer or inner communion with

36
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,560
the spirit thereof, be that spirit God or law, is a process wherein work is really done. And

37
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:46,560
spiritual energy flows in and produces effects, psychological or material, within the phenomenal

38
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:57,120
world. And then another very short piece on the self. We have in the fact that the conscious person

39
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,320
is continuous with a wider self through which saving experiences come, a positive content

40
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,400
religious experience, which it seems to me is literally and objectively true as far as it goes.

41
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,520
And the other thing I just wanted to observe about Rupert and Ian is that they are both

42
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:25,200
voracious readers, and they have read widely and deeply all their lives. And their libraries are

43
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,840
pretty impressive. I have a fairly impressive library as well. So between us, I think we

44
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:39,680
we span a considerable range. And so I'm going to hand over to you, Ian and Rupert. And I think Ian,

45
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:49,600
you were going to open the batting as it were. Okay, yes, yes, that's good. I should refer to

46
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,360
Schopenhauer's view that never read books, reading books is for people who got no ideas of their own.

47
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,520
But anyway, can we spotlight Ian, please? And Rupert,

48
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:13,520
just wait to Rupert appear on the screen. There we are. Yes, I'm speaking from the bedroom of the

49
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:23,760
daughter of a friend in a flat in London. And yes, it's hard to get my I feel so

50
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,960
so much that I belong where I live that it's quite hard to sort of reconstitute my mental

51
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:39,040
world here for the moment. But I think what I want to say is that I've become more and more

52
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,240
convinced that none of the things that we desperately need to do to solve the various

53
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:52,320
problems that we we face and that we talk about a great deal, none of this in the end

54
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:03,200
will matter unless we are able to get back to the spiritual ground of our being. And in other

55
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,440
words, we could, by some sort of a miracle, we could, we could reverse the pollution of the seas,

56
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:17,360
we could perhaps do something to at least slow climate change, we could make it harder for people

57
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,080
to carry on felling ancient forests, all this I believe in powerfully. But I also think that

58
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:31,920
none of it will add up to a hill of beans unless we re-engage with the spiritual basis of a human

59
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,280
life. I don't think it will be any longer know what it is to be a human being. I think people

60
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,560
haven't the foggiest idea what they're doing here, what the cosmos in which they come into being

61
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,520
come into being is like and what their relationship with the earth that is their home is like.

62
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,200
And I'm just going to say a few things for you, but then ask you to respond to them really.

63
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:05,040
In the new book I wrote The Matter With Things, I suggest first of all that

64
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:12,960
many of the ways in which we look at the the constitution of the cosmos are upside down or

65
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,160
back to front. So in other words, we tend to think for example that the first of all there are

66
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,120
things and then there are relations between them, some of which we make in our minds, and that's

67
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,080
the way it is. Whereas I argue throughout a very long book that in fact relations are absolutely

68
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,080
primary. There is nothing that truly exists that is not a relation and is not in fact in process,

69
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:44,240
as Whitehead pointed out. So in other words, relations and processes are primary, not status

70
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,560
and things. And I also believe that for example, it's not that there's literal truth and that's

71
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,200
really the important thing and metaphorical truths are just some kind of semi-imaginary

72
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,560
extension of literal truth. In fact, I believe that all fundamental truths are metaphorical in

73
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,040
nature and that literal truth is just a very special kind that we've invented to describe

74
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,240
a small subset of things that occur at a very everyday level. But for the purposes of what

75
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,920
we're talking about now, I want to suggest that it's not that somehow there is anonymity and then

76
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:36,080
there is life and then there is consciousness and then there is a sense of the great values,

77
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,880
goodness, beauty, truth and the sacred. I think it's the other way around that what actually exists

78
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:50,240
fundamentally is a consciousness, which is a field of consciousness, which is divine, which

79
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:58,080
which has the qualities of attending to and drawing us towards goodness, beauty and truth

80
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:06,080
and the sense of the holy and sacred. And that it's for this that we've developed

81
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:14,320
our complexity as human beings, since we are not better than animals, but we are in this sense

82
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:22,320
above them that we can hope to respond to, to receive, to resonate with and to give

83
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,200
a full and fulfilling response to those leading values that draw us forward.

84
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,160
So that's the way I would like to think of it, Rupert. What would you say to that?

85
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,720
Well, I think of it in a very similar way and so do most people in the world for that matter.

86
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,960
If you actually look at, we live in a particularly godless part of the world, Western Europe,

87
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,120
but it's not quite the same if you go to Africa or India or many other parts of the world, or

88
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:04,960
Iraq or Iran or I mean the Middle East. Most people are religious in the world and

89
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:13,280
this kind of secularist, secular humanist, atheist, tinted culture that we have

90
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,680
is a historical anomaly. Most people were religious in Europe. And as Charles Taylor

91
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,760
in his wonderful book, A Secular Age, points out in the year 1500 in Europe,

92
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,680
everyone believed in God, everyone believed in the kind of vision you've just put forward.

93
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,800
It was almost impossible not to, not because people were coerced into believing that,

94
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,000
but because there was just no credible alternative. And what's happened is through the growth of,

95
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,200
first through the Protestant Reformation, the disenchantment of the world that happened

96
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:59,280
in part through the Protestant Reformation, a lack of emphasis on nature, a focus entirely on human

97
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,760
consciousness. And then through the Scientific Revolution, the Mechanistic Materialist worldview

98
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,120
that's grown out of it, we now have this very secular world where people think that

99
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,560
evolution and life starts from the bottom up, you know, from genes and molecules and cells.

100
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,560
And everything builds up until you've got big enough brains where the light of consciousness

101
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,840
mysteriously comes on. And then we start thinking about bigger things like God, but they're all

102
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,440
just inventions inside our own minds, and hence inside our own brains. And you'd be able to tell

103
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:51,680
us exactly where. No, I wouldn't do that. I mean, both you and I are discussing in what, in fact,

104
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,840
a whole scientific medical network has been concerned with right from the start is

105
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,480
trying to find a way back to a worldview that is still consonant with science, because science

106
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,520
isn't going to go away. And we've learned a great many things about nature through the scientific

107
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:17,760
process. But to recover a sense of this connection, which is actually there in all traditions, I mean,

108
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,160
shamanic traditions, all admit that there's a war or all just assume that there's some realm,

109
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,560
they have different views of it, but there are realms beyond our own that what we see is not

110
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,520
all there is. And as my main teacher, Father Bede Griffiths used to point out that, you know,

111
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:45,040
the center of all religious and spiritual culture is a direct experience of our minds, our consciousness

112
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,800
being part of something vastly greater than ourselves. And as he pointed out, all religions

113
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,280
start from that experience is not a dogma, it's an experience. And then they interpret it. I mean,

114
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,480
his favorite metaphor was the hand and that sort of central experience of unity is like the palm of

115
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,920
the hand. And then it's interpreted in different cultures, in different traditions, different

116
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,920
languages. They like the fingers of the hand, all the different interpretations of this primary

117
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,920
unit of experiences, sense of ultimate unity, which are interpreted in all these different

118
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,880
cultural ways. But that is the central foundation of all these religious traditions. And as far as

119
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,040
we know, this intuition that we're part of something greater than ourselves is very ancient. I mean,

120
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,840
all these cave paintings from 2030, 40,000 years ago, the practice of burying the dead and so on,

121
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,400
all the or dealing with the dead in a ritual way, all these things suggest that this has been part of

122
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:55,200
human consciousness for a very, very long time. No doubt the forms have changed and the development

123
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:02,240
of the great religions has sort of put a more unifying aspect on these insights. But it seems

124
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,000
to me that it's been foundational to human life for throughout almost all human history,

125
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,320
with the brief anomaly of Western Europe and parts of North America in the last 150 years.

126
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,400
Yes, of course. And it is worth reflecting on the fact that it would be entirely irrational

127
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,400
to suppose that we were aware of everything in the cosmos. Why on earth would we? I mean,

128
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,480
we know in the very simplest level that there are sounds that we can't hear but that bears and bats

129
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:46,640
can hear. So what we know is limited by our senses and by the relative unsophistication of our brains.

130
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,080
I say relative because relative to what there is for us to approach, if one has any kind of

131
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,800
sense of imagination, one can see that things that we sense are there and that, as you say,

132
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,960
throughout the world people have believed were there. This is not irrational. This is a very

133
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:12,480
reasonable supposition. And there are people in, for example, Australia, the native people there who

134
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,560
say they can hear and see things at a distance. They can hear people, ancestors speaking to them.

135
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,640
And who are we, frankly, to say that they don't hear those things? I like the, I think,

136
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:33,040
I'm sure you would agree, the very important idea of Goethe's that we develop senses to perceive

137
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:45,120
things in response to the bits of experience that we are able to get. And that, therefore,

138
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,240
if we don't actually allow ourselves to experience certain things, then an organ that we might have

139
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,280
will atrophy. And I suggest that we've allowed organs that would help us to see these things and

140
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,560
hear these things and know these things. We've allowed them to atrophy and that people that we

141
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,320
consider more primitive than us and indeed our own children up to an age before they're

142
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,280
they're told that it's not it's not wise or intelligent to say that you see these things

143
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:24,480
of you're fantasizing. I mean, these people have the organs of perception that we need in order to

144
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,160
to reach the divine or to have any inklings of it. And I suppose that we all have enough

145
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,480
of an inkling of that that unless we shut it down, we can follow it and one hopes to grow it.

146
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,880
You know, Keats called this world a veil of soul making. And in other words, we are we are

147
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:53,520
nourishing or stunting the soul by the way in which we live. Yes, well, I think the

148
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:04,400
one way of looking at it is Charles Taylor suggests that in in Europe in say up to 1500 or

149
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:12,880
later, people had the idea that minds of porous porosity is a word he uses. And the anthropologist

150
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,280
Tanya Lerman, who's at Stanford, is I think one of the most interesting anthropologists of religion

151
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,600
writing at the moment. And in her latest paper, she talks about porosity in all religions, it's

152
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:33,600
assumed that our minds of porous to influences from each other influences from spirits, gods, angels,

153
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,920
other beings, that minds are porous. And what Charles Taylor shows is that since the 17th century,

154
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,280
there's been this shutting down. So the idea we've ended up ended up with is our minds are

155
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,520
completely insulated with inside the privacy of our skulls, nothing but the electrical

156
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,760
activity of our brains or other activities of the brains inside our heads. And they're all

157
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:10,560
separated off from everything else, completely privatized. And what Tanya Lerman shows is that

158
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:19,360
she wrote her most recent book is called How God Becomes Real. And the previous one was called

159
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:27,840
How God Talks Back. She's done anthropological studies of charismatic Christians, evangelical

160
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:35,520
groups, women, women praying in Tehran, Muslim women praying in Tehran, shamanic cultures and

161
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,320
so forth. She's done and she shows that in all these traditions, there's the idea that we're open

162
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,680
to spirits or beings of other kinds. But she also points out that this is actually something that

163
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:57,120
requires a cultural reinforcement and effort on our part. You know, if you believe in God,

164
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,680
it's not just a kind of passive belief that people who believe in God pray, they go to temples,

165
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:10,160
churches, services, they meet with others, they pray together, they have annual ceremonies,

166
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:18,560
rituals, practices, etc. There's a lot of work goes into making these beliefs more apparent and more

167
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,240
directly experienced. And I think something similar happens with people who have to put in

168
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,800
quite a lot of work to maintain the secular worldview, to maintain the secular atheist

169
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,640
worldview. Denying all these things involves quite a lot of hard work on denial. You first of all

170
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:46,240
have to deny all your own telepathic experiences and 85% of people have these experiences with

171
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,920
telepathic telephone calls. You have to deny that you can really tell when someone's staring

172
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:58,000
at you from behind and 95% of people have experienced that. You have to deny that you have

173
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,080
flashes of insight or mystical experience that appear to connect you with a consciousness

174
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,560
greater than your own. If you take psychedelics, which give a wonderful sense of connection with

175
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,800
something greater than yourself, you have to deny that that's real. But you just have to say, well,

176
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:24,480
that's just because chemical disturbances inside the brain. So even atheism and secularism

177
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:33,200
require quite a lot of effort in denial. And the motive for the denial, I suppose,

178
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:41,040
is fitting in with the secular world. And what the only positive side of it or is a self-congratulatory

179
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,840
feeling, you're smarter than everyone else, because you've seen through all these false

180
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:52,080
beliefs and childish attitudes that children have and so-called primitive people do.

181
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,560
When you were reading the Varieties of Religious Experience at school, I had a housemaster who

182
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:07,360
he was trying to show me the limitations of the orthodox Christianity in which the school chapel

183
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:17,200
we all had to go there every day. And I was reading bits of J.G. Fraser's The Golden Bow

184
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:24,080
and Robert Green's White Goddess. His aim was to prove to me that Christianity was no better

185
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:31,440
than these primitive, superstitious beliefs found all over the world. And since we were

186
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,960
quite happy to dismiss all of them as mumbo jumbo, the same applied to Christianity, it was

187
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,160
no better than them. And the first I was persuaded, I thought this was an appalling weakness because

188
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:48,880
it presumed to be superior to these other beliefs. I've later come to see this as tremendous strength

189
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,040
that it has so much in common with myth and archetypal patterns found all over the world.

190
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But the idea that we're smarter than others, Fraser and all those late 19th century figures,

191
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,240
early 20th century figures, had the view that we've risen above the sort of animistic superstition

192
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,840
and then you get religion, which is a bit better, not much better. And then you go beyond that to

193
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,400
science and then you realize all that stuff, basically childish rubbish we've drove great

194
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,200
and out of. So I think that that's how we've got here. And I think it does take quite a lot of

195
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,400
effort, as I say, for people to maintain that belief. And I suppose that you would map some of

196
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:43,600
this, I'm just guessing, onto actors of different parts of the brain. Yes, maybe. I mean, before

197
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:58,640
we go there, though, you raised a number of interesting points. I argue also in my chapter

198
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:09,520
28 of the matter with things of the sense of the sacred, from evidence given by psychological

199
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:17,920
studies that actually it takes more effort to deny. It's not true that as Dawkins suggests that

200
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,160
we are indoctrinated into religion. In fact, it's the opposite that it takes more cognitive effort

201
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:32,080
to inhibit these ideas. That doesn't mean that they're wrong, of course. But it is interesting

202
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:39,920
that if you have people, and maybe that is to do with the brain, that some people, especially

203
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:47,920
people with autism, and who are something like a 10 times more likely to be atheistic,

204
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:59,200
the normal brain is actually allowing us to, if we will not suppress it, to experience the

205
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,400
sort of things that you're talking about. And going back to my idea that the things that we

206
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:13,680
think are primary are not, and the things that we think are secondary are not. So in the case of

207
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:21,280
oneness, you were talking about how we have to go back to an idea of being porous. But this is,

208
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:27,520
as you're suggesting, I think this is the natural state to see ourselves as in connection with the

209
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:39,200
world. And you get in panpsychism a very interesting phenomenon, which is that people say, okay,

210
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,040
so how do we, okay, maybe the logical position, since we can't see how to get

211
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,640
consciousness out of mere lumpen matter, maybe the answer is everything's got consciousness in it.

212
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,960
But then how do we recompose it? You know, how do we put this together? It's actually called

213
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,280
the combination problem. This is typical of the left hemisphere, which having, first of all,

214
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,360
ruptured a unity, then doesn't know how to, quote, recreate the unity. But the unity is there.

215
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,840
The unity is primary, not a secondary phenomenon that has to be put together and achieved.

216
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:20,160
So I think that that kind of panpsychism is, is somewhat irrational and left hemisphere dominated.

217
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,240
Now, you've brought me to the position where, of course, I've mentioned hemispheres.

218
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,080
And I should say to anybody listening that my position is not that the brain

219
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,840
creates our experience at all. I say that logically, there are three possibilities,

220
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:44,480
the brain either imits experience, or it transmits experience, or it permits experience.

221
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,560
And I, I believe that in fact, the brain is a permitter of experience that shapes it,

222
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,280
much as the vocal chords, as William James pointed out, are what shape his voice,

223
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,920
a restriction, a constriction and inhibition and negation, some kind of molding or

224
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:13,200
no saying to the breath that would come through. If there was no such molding or permitting,

225
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:21,120
then there would be no voice at all. But coming to the boring stuff about brain correlates,

226
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,920
we do know that I'm afraid it just isn't a matter of fact. And I give, I think it's appendix

227
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:36,320
seven or something in the matter of things. I do go over the science on hemisphere difference in

228
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:48,080
spirituality in relation to mindfulness, meditation in general, and shamanism, religious

229
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:55,280
experiences of certain kinds. And the overwhelming evidence is that this requires a shift of balance

230
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:06,080
away from the normal slight, uh, bias towards the left hemisphere. In these experiences, one finds

231
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,640
that this imbalance, if you like, is redressed and not only redressed, but that the centers

232
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:21,280
that are subtending these kinds of experience are very clearly right hemisphere related. So

233
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:29,840
in a culture which I believe promotes the values of the left hemisphere, sees the world as particulate,

234
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:39,360
made up of isolated things that are fixed, that are unchanging, inanimate, abstracted,

235
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:47,600
explicit. There is no room for this kind of, this kind of experience. Indeed, I was talking yesterday

236
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,200
to clergy in Canterbury, and I don't know what they thought of it. But I was trying to explain

237
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,400
that all the sort of things that you need in order to open your mind to the existence of a divine

238
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,400
being are militated against by the natural mode of the left hemisphere, which is to pin things down,

239
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:12,960
to look for certainty, to focus on the explicit rather than the implicit, to see things as naturally

240
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:22,480
inanimate rather than animate, and to be all the time cataloging and charting experience as on a map,

241
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:29,200
or having a theory about it rather than actually allowing experience to come to you. To do that,

242
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,920
you've got to have an opposite cast of mind, which is in fact the cast of mind that the right

243
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:42,240
hemisphere enables for us in daily life, which is the voice of a way of seeing things in which there

244
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,680
is no final certainty. There are things that are probable, and there are things that are more likely

245
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:53,360
than others, but there's no final certainty. Nothing is finally separated from anything else.

246
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,640
Nothing is ever completely fixed. It's always moving, changing and flowing. All the really

247
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,560
important stuff cannot be put into language. Anybody who's been in love knows how incredibly

248
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:12,320
feeble the language is to deal with this extraordinary experience. And of course,

249
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:19,520
any of you who are listening who are persuaded that there is a spiritual realm, a divine realm,

250
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:28,320
that you can have intimations of, this again is beyond conceptual reduction in language.

251
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:38,560
The right hemisphere enables us to be more willing to accept paradox, to accept things

252
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:45,200
that are not certain. And this is the realm where we find the spiritual life.

253
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:55,200
Yes, the sense of not certainty, I mean, there is a sense though in some spiritual experiences

254
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,400
where there is a great certainty. I mean, for example, people have had near death experiences,

255
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:06,080
or mystical experiences spontaneously, or as a result of spiritual practices,

256
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:14,080
or as a lot of psychedelics. I mean, I myself, when I've had some of these types of experiences,

257
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,640
one of the things that people say about them is that you know that it's real, that it's

258
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:26,000
more real than normal reality. And near death experiences which last a few minutes,

259
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,040
change people's lives because they feel they've contacted a realm, a reality which is

260
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,320
more real, more certain in a way than the ordinary world we live in. And they don't

261
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,880
have any doubt that there's this spiritual reality because they've directly experienced it.

262
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,840
Now, I don't know whether that, to what extent that depends on one or both hemispheres,

263
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:59,280
or whether it goes beyond the brain altogether. But what's so convincing for many people about

264
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,880
these experiences is precisely that they seem unquestionably real.

265
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,560
Yes, raises two points really. One is this. I would make a distinction between

266
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:19,120
the absolutely certain and an asymptotic approach to certainty. And the left hemisphere

267
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,840
has a category of things that are yes and no. And I don't think that experience, well,

268
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,120
not in my experience, there is ever this, I'm not lucky enough to have had one of these experiences,

269
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,080
but I imagine if I had one, I'd say I'm almost as certain of this as I can be of anything,

270
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,240
which is different from claiming absolute certainty or absolute truth. But the other

271
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,840
thing about it is something that my housemaster Martin Scott, the man who really modeled for me

272
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:56,640
the wonderful relation between a man who was profoundly sane, very funny, hyperalert to the

273
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,520
ridiculous, was also a deeply spiritual and in that sense, a very serious person. And he

274
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:09,680
modeled and conveyed to me that way of looking at things. And one of the things he emphasized to me

275
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:18,160
was that the true religious experience is not really about these moments of certainty or about,

276
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,840
you know, levitating or seeing the future or any of these things nice as they may be. They are not

277
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,920
the center of it. And that in fact, they're not particularly prized by the mystics who had these

278
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:39,200
experiences and not particularly prized actually by the Buddhist masters. They don't think that

279
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,960
these amazing transformative experiences are really what it's about. But it's typical of our

280
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,320
society that we would imagine that there is an experience of this kind. And it's not about a

281
00:33:50,320 --> 00:34:00,480
more humble application of a kind of disposition towards the world, which is one of awe and humility

282
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,440
and compassion, which I believe is at the center of it. So I'm not disrespecting extraordinary

283
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:15,200
experiences. I'm just saying that I'm a skeptic amongst believers and I'm a believer

284
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:22,880
amongst skeptics. I've always been like this. And when people do this, I find myself suddenly

285
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:29,040
running to the other part of the balance here to sort of keep things properly in perspective.

286
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,440
Well, speaking from my own experience, I've had these moments of insight where I've just

287
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,600
known that there's a greater consciousness than all my experience. But on a day to day basis,

288
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:50,400
those are quite rare, those experiences are not like every day. And that's where spiritual practices

289
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:57,920
come in. And I myself meditate in the mornings and I pray in the evenings. And I see these as

290
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,160
different daily ways of relating. I see the meditation, I think I was more like breathing in.

291
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:13,120
And I close my eyes, I try not to be occupied with the things in my room or wherever I'm doing it.

292
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:22,000
I have mantras, I concentrate on the mantra and sit quietly, and thoughts go through my mind and

293
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,480
so on. And so it's a way of withdrawing not only from the outer world, but also from the inner world

294
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,800
of the default mode network of constant inner chatter, what it still goes on, but you detach

295
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,800
from it and you just let it pass and so on. So that's like I think like breathing in, whereas

296
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,360
prayer I experience in is almost the opposite direction, petitionary prayer. You start with

297
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:53,600
an invocation or prayers start with an invocation, our Father who art in heaven, Hail Mary full of

298
00:35:53,600 --> 00:36:02,480
grace, Om Nomah Shivaya, O Allah. You start with an invocation to being graced in yourself, a form

299
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,400
of consciousness graced in yourself. And then in petitionary prayer, we're asking for things which

300
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,320
is the most common or common or garden form of prayer, I mean basic found all over the world in

301
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:21,440
all different traditions. You then direct intention towards things that in the outer world,

302
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:29,520
someone who's sick, a problem that you're worried about, some threat you want to pray for protection

303
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,880
or defense. So it's very practical about the affairs of everyday life and the immediate

304
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,840
problems in one's life. So in that sense, it's like breathing out, it's going from a spiritual

305
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:49,360
center towards the outer world, towards actual particular problems. And so I see these as both

306
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,280
ways. I see them as complementary to each other and breathing in and breathing out metaphor

307
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,240
is shows I mean, we can only breathe out because we breathe in and vice versa. So

308
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:10,320
have the flow in both directions. But these are a way of coming to a center within one's

309
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,560
self where one's consciousness is connected to or one can sometimes experience this connection

310
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:23,440
to a greater ground of being or consciousness. And then praying is connecting that center to

311
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,320
the affairs of the world. Both of these increase the sense of porosity, the idea that one's

312
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,200
consciousness is related to something greater. And also that the everyday affairs that one's

313
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:41,280
concerned with and the problems in the world and hopes and fears and all that are related to

314
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,200
something greater than oneself as well. And I think that everyone who prays and it's in if you

315
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,880
take the whole world, most people pray, even if you take Britain, far more people pray than

316
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,320
actually go to church or have regular religious practices. I think these are ways in which on

317
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,720
an everyday basis, we have a greater sense of this connection. Well, I like very much that image of

318
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:14,320
breathing in and breathing out naturally. And I don't, I don't in any way deny your experience, but

319
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:23,920
I'm also immediately reminded of St Francis's admonition that when you pray, you should ask for

320
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,880
nothing, nothing. He's very emphatic about it. I think Mother Teresa said much of the same thing.

321
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,320
And I remember the words of the infant Samuel, was it speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

322
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,760
When the one's praying, it's more about listening than talking. But it doesn't mean that one doesn't

323
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:52,960
remember people that one cares for and cares about. It would be odd and counter-intuitive

324
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:03,520
to do that. So I think one bears them in one's mind, in one's care, and one commends that to God.

325
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,080
If one asks for anything, one has to, after all, couch that with the words, you know,

326
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:22,640
if it so be your will. I do ask for things, I suppose, but I'm slightly conflicted about it.

327
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,440
I think that the greater part of praying is actually creating a space in which something

328
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,200
can come to you. Indeed, I think all creation and imagination is not about going out

329
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,320
and doing something, but about creating a space for something to happen.

330
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,720
As I often say, a gardener can't make a plant. All the gardener can do is create, create a space

331
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,640
for the plant to flourish or stifle the plant, but the plant has its own existence. And I think

332
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:02,160
that whatever the spirit, the divine spirit is trying to bring to us, we crowd out with our own

333
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:13,040
desires, our own wishes, our own formulations, and that being open is about creating a space

334
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:20,560
for things to happen. I'm going to just mention here this extraordinary notion of the creation

335
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,840
that comes from the Lurianic cabala, the prime being, the ground of being aims off.

336
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:35,120
Being relational, as God is and as love is, needs a creation to return that love, to be

337
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,480
the object of that love, and to realize the relationship with the loved one, which must

338
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,800
be free. And so what is the first act of aims off in creation? It's something called sim sum,

339
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,240
which means withdrawal, and that is a withdrawal to make a space in which there can be something other

340
00:40:52,240 --> 00:41:04,480
than this creature, this ground of being, not a creature. And then there are 12 of them that are

341
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,760
in this space to catch whatever it is that comes out of aims off. The single spark of fire comes

342
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:16,400
out of aims off and lands on these vessels and shatters most of them. And the third

343
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,520
act of creation is called tikkun, which means repair. And this is the particular

344
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:33,040
honor, duty, purpose indeed of humanity is to repair these shattered vessels and to make

345
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,800
them more beautiful than they were before. And in that image, I think of this Japanese

346
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,480
art of ceramics called kintsugi, in which you repair a shattered vessel, but it's more beautiful

347
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:53,920
than it was before, often repaired with lines of guilt or gold that come into the ceramics.

348
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,560
So this idea of creating a space for things to happen, drawing back and being unknowing and

349
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:07,520
undoing is, I think, very important. Well, personally, I see that as more the role of

350
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,360
meditation. I mean, there are various forms of prayer. Contemplative prayer or meditation

351
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:21,360
is creating a space. I'm meditating quite often. I mean, I'm not meditating in order to have sort

352
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:28,240
of ideas, but quite often, ideas pop into my mind about things of work I'm doing, ideas,

353
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,240
scientific experiments and so forth. But petitionary prayer, I mean, there's an amazing

354
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,040
range of opinions. I used to belong to a group called the epiphany philosophers in Cambridge,

355
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:46,640
and we had retreats together. We had Easter vigils and we had masses at various times of the year,

356
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,280
which the priests who celebrated them for us at one stage was Ron Williams, who is a member of

357
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:01,680
this group. And once I was thinking about prayer, and we prayed together, we did matins and even

358
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,480
song every day together when we were on retreats. And I then said, well, could we go around the

359
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,760
circle? We all knew each other very well, and just say something about how we ourselves prayed.

360
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,040
And it was astonishing. I had just no idea these people I prayed with many times saw it say

361
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,400
differently. Some thought that we shouldn't ever pray for anything specific, a bit like you,

362
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,720
you know, could hold people before God and or hold them in the light of God, but not

363
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,840
tell God what to do because God already knew everything. So absolutely not right to do that.

364
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:45,120
Others prayed very, very specifically, as Jesus does in the New Testament, and Jesus is not just

365
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,560
holding people specifically, caring specific people. He didn't care everybody when he walked

366
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:57,920
into the room, he'd care one person at a time with a particular personal sort of act of healing.

367
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:07,280
So it was much, it was really quite specific. And so there was a wide range of opinion about

368
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,200
how specific we should be. And those who believed in the specificity would say it's not telling God

369
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,360
what to do, it's being co-creators with the divine that God works through us. An idea similar to what

370
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:25,600
you just said God works through us. And he asked for God's guidance in our prayers. You're not just

371
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:32,080
coming up with ideas, I want to have a new car or I'd like to have more money or something like that.

372
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:40,160
It's not like God in prayer is like celestial Amazon with delivery next day.

373
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:49,840
Yes. I remember a joke about that. I prayed for a new bicycle, but then I realized God doesn't

374
00:44:49,840 --> 00:45:02,480
work like that. So I stole a bicycle and prayed for forgiveness. But I do, you see, I'm trying to hold

375
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:10,240
together two uncertainties, which is always my problem. I really respect what you're saying.

376
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,560
And of course, whether you call it prayer that caused Christ to heal people or something else,

377
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,400
I don't know. But the C.S. Lewis pointed out the idea that prayer will produce the outcome we desire

378
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,960
can be completely dispensary because the holiest of all petitioners in the Garden of Gethsemane

379
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,640
prayed three times for this cup to be taken from him and it simply wasn't. So we can

380
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,480
assume that this is not the way that prayer does work. Having said that, I believe that

381
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,440
disposing one's mind towards an outcome and disposing many people's minds towards an outcome

382
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,880
may help that outcome come about. I don't know quite how and it may be by modes that you're

383
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:04,720
more articulate about that we call parapsychological but are probably entirely natural.

384
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,840
Yes. I think forming the intention you see is part of this co-creation. And I think the power of

385
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,640
praying together. I'm a regular church girl because I like praying together. I like singing

386
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:25,440
together and I like being in a holy place with members of the community who pray together. So

387
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,880
I go wherever I am on Sundays and small village churches on local parish church here in Hampstead

388
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,800
or wherever I am. So I think that creating an intention together is very, very important.

389
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:45,360
And of course the secularized version of prayer and intention is positive thinking

390
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:51,360
which is huge in America. For a hundred years or more there have been all these books on

391
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:59,280
the power of positive thinking. Where you form an intention and then to sell more vacuum cleaners

392
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:08,240
or icopedios and then you sell more because you form the intention. And one of the most perverse

393
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:14,720
examples of positive thinking is of course the former president Donald Trump who was raised in

394
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:22,640
the church of positive thinking. The chap who was the prophet of positive thinking what's he

395
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,640
called Norman. I've forgotten the name for the moment but the power of positive thinking.

396
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,880
I don't have anything to do with these pop psychologists. Norman Vincent Peale.

397
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,320
Oh yes, Norman Vincent Peale. That's right. I did. You know the power of positive thinking.

398
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,600
He was the minister of something called the Marble Church in Manhattan where Trump's family went

399
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:50,800
and as a teenager Trump imbibed all this. So Norman Vincent Peale married him to his first wife.

400
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,840
So he was absolutely raised in formative on positive thinking and the idea is you just

401
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,320
say something and you can make it come true through power of intention. So he loses the

402
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,360
election so he says he's won it. You know this is pure positive thinking taken to its most

403
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,120
In my terms it's pure left hemisphere thinking because the left hemisphere

404
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,600
and believes that it has power to create the outcome at once and there's always an optimism

405
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:22,480
optimism and if something doesn't work out the way it believes it will deny that black is black.

406
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:31,440
It will say a paralyzed limb is such that they can use it freely and so it's power to deny

407
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:37,040
reality in order to fit in with its theory about reality is the defining feature of it

408
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:43,600
and I would say that you know Trumpism is just an expression of this mentality and not one that I

409
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:50,480
particularly want to take as my guide. Oh I certainly don't. The point about it is you see

410
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:57,760
that it's a kind of debased or secularized form. Yes I know what you're saying. It's about getting

411
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:04,080
what you want through positive thinking. You have success in love and business through positive

412
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:08,480
thinking. That's why these books sell so well. You know they're all about selling more of the

413
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:15,520
product and getting ahead and so forth and the basic principle that forming intentions can

414
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,680
actually have effects in the world but the point about proper prayer positive things about me

415
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,440
getting what I want through the power of my mind and that's where the left hemisphere goes magical

416
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:36,160
as it were or attempts to. Whereas the normal prayer I mean I myself being Christian always

417
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,240
start my prayers with the Lord's Prayer and part of that is right at the beginning is

418
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,480
Thy will be done so it's a prayer in a much as you were mentioning into a much larger context

419
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:53,760
of God's will and the larger purposes of which I'm a part and I play a part within that larger

420
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,680
pattern but if you and I suppose that would be more like a right hemisphere thing because it's

421
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:05,440
part of a global vision of what's happening in the world but then you could say the secularization

422
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:12,960
of prayer as it removes the right hemisphere aspect until it becomes left hemisphere activity

423
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,600
but I think positive thinking can't be understood as a movement or a practice

424
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:24,080
without its background in petitionary prayer from which it's kind of truncated derivative.

425
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,560
Yes no I think that's fine I don't think we need to to disagree too much about this

426
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:39,120
I mean I suppose that the touchstone for me is the is the holocaust I mean all these innocent

427
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:45,360
people and innocent children treated with utmost barbarity and you suppose that

428
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:52,800
the decent people, Jews, Christians and others did not pray that they should be spared this but

429
00:50:52,800 --> 00:51:01,120
they weren't so you know that that is a I can I can there is a theodicy I think which is simply that

430
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,080
whatever God is God has to allow his creation freedom otherwise it's simply an extension

431
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:15,040
of himself and it's not another that he can love it is not a creation so that that creation

432
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:23,360
must have the freedom to do good or ill and unfortunately a lot of time we do evil.

433
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:32,240
Anyway let's talk about many other things as the walrus said what should we move to

434
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,880
panpsychism or would you like to talk about consciousness and matter or the nature of

435
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:46,320
time or where should we go? Well I think while we're on consciousness and I think one the view

436
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,880
that you started with you know our present bottom-up view I mean the traditional view is

437
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,880
the opposite that starts with consciousness that consciousness underlies all things

438
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:06,480
and then the whole of nature is produced through consciousness in the christian version

439
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,800
in the creed it says the cosmic christ you know through him all things were made

440
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:17,600
that there's a part of the divine the second person of the holy trinity the logast which is

441
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:25,440
the realm of names and forms it's through all creation is divinely or comes forth from an

442
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,440
ultimate source of form and structure that everything in that sense shares within the

443
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:39,040
divine consciousness god is in nature nature is in god and that is not panpsychism but

444
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:46,160
panentheism the idea that god is everywhere in nature and that nature is in god so god is

445
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:54,640
the mind of god transcends nature it's not just nature because of pantheism and so I think what

446
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:02,160
we've got at the moment now coming to panpsychism is the this the main driver for modern panpsychism

447
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,120
is to try and as you said to solve the hard problem because the hard problem is that if you

448
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,840
have a materialist view that the whole world is made up of unconsciousness or nothing else

449
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,640
there's no consciousness out there the only consciousness there is is inside brains and

450
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:25,840
moreover the maximum amounts inside human brains and maybe lesser amounts in dog brains and

451
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:34,080
elephant brains and perhaps tiny amounts in worm brains or ant brains that that consciousness

452
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:40,000
is confined to brains the entire universe is unconscious except on this planet and it's

453
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
unconscious on the entire planet except for the inside of human and animal heads that's the standard

454
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:51,520
view but it has the problem then of saying well if the whole universe is unconscious mass

455
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,640
unconscious how come we're conscious everything ought to be unconscious and then as you know

456
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,840
a lot of philosophers of mind of a materialist persuasion try to pretend we're not conscious

457
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:07,840
it's an illusion it doesn't do anything that's a happy phenomenon ridiculous yes let's try and

458
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:13,600
get rid of consciousness no so the panpsychist so you know the bright boy at the back of the class

459
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,800
and among materialist philosophers of mind said well what if have we say electrons and atoms are

460
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,840
a bit conscious then and we can explain our consciousness there's a difference of degree

461
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:30,800
not of kind but they usually end there once they get to the human brain they think they've made

462
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,320
their point and that's where panpsychism ends but as you know i've tried to carry this argument

463
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:41,120
further in in my paper in the journal of consciousness studies is the silent conscious

464
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:47,760
i tried to go with this panpsychist move and say okay well let's say that there really is this

465
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:54,720
kind of panpsychism then why stop at the human brain the sun is self-organizing system vastly

466
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,080
larger than our brains with vastly more complex electromagnetic patterns why can't the sun be

467
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,200
conscious why can't other stars be conscious and indeed whole galaxies with higher levels of

468
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:12,640
consciousness and then clusters of galaxies and then the entire cosmos and of course this is not a

469
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:21,280
new idea then Plato and platinus and many others talked about the world soul the the whole universe

470
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:27,600
having a kind of soul mind or organizing principle and that would be a kind of pantheistic

471
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,400
global consciousness but then the traditional view is that that itself has embedded within the larger

472
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,160
more inclusive source of consciousness which is in the end the source of nature

473
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:46,480
but so panpsychism as we currently have it is a fairly limited form of panpsychism it's a kind

474
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:53,760
of materialist panpsychism which just attributes kind of epiphenomenal consciousness to material

475
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:02,800
structures up to indicating the human brain yes yes well as you possibly know i'm a panentist

476
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:09,200
and it's a very different thing from being a pantheist but there is a way in fact of

477
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:19,200
approaching what is meant by panpsychism further towards panentism and almost making it

478
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:27,680
making them a union if you start from the idea that there is separate stuff in the realm of

479
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:34,160
matter and that you've got to find a union to it then you have this famous combination problem

480
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:44,480
but if you start from the view as i do that the promptly the ontological primitive is consciousness

481
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:51,360
there is nothing you can get beyond or behind you can't go beyond or behind consciousness

482
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:58,800
consciousness is the ultimate reality i was asked yesterday by clergy well is consciousness god and

483
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:06,880
i suppose yes but no because i don't want to sort of limit what god is rather in the panentistic

484
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:16,560
way consciousness is a divine creation but what i see is that matter is a mode of manifestation of

485
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:28,160
consciousness so at times it is it is something that is immaterial or appears to be but we only

486
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:34,480
know what we call material things because we have consciousness we don't know that we have

487
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,040
consciousness because of material things such as brains but we do know the one thing where

488
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:45,120
can be certain of his consciousness which is why it's so particularly annoying that people

489
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:52,160
are sitting on well-paid and prestigious chairs in american universities claiming that consciousness

490
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:58,800
is an illusion but anyway and consciousness is the basic reality and people say well matter

491
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:04,240
doesn't look like consciousness but then i suggest that we think about it as a phase of it in the way

492
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:10,800
that ice is a phase of water you know water is translucent and flowing and so forth but ice is

493
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:18,160
is static and opaque and extremely hard and so hard it can split your head open and in this room

494
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:23,520
there is a a tunnel more of of water in the atmosphere otherwise i couldn't breathe so

495
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,760
they don't look like one another but which is the real water they're all real water and i think the

496
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:37,120
there are all these ways in which consciousness can manifest and one of them is in what we call

497
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:42,480
matter and why should there be matter well i suggest there's matter because it provides

498
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:52,720
two important things for creation it provides importantly an element of resistance nothing

499
00:58:52,720 --> 00:59:00,480
can come into existence without there being some element of resistance or something that moves

500
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:08,880
against that that trend of of creation i mean you know everything has this dual aspect you

501
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:14,480
what is friction friction stops movement certainly but it also starts movement without friction you

502
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:22,080
can't move and without there being some definition which means literally the the limits to things

503
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:28,320
that can't be the whole world that we experience with all its magical beauty and complexity so it

504
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:35,440
brings that degree of of a resistance and it brings a degree of temporary permanence in other

505
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:42,480
words the things i'm saying disappear as soon as i say them may linger in somebody's mind somewhere

506
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,680
for a few seconds but you know the desk at which i'm sitting will be here tomorrow absent a world

507
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:55,760
so those are the ways i would see it and that is completely constant with what you were saying

508
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,720
about the divine being what you're really saying is the divine is imminent and the

509
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:06,160
divine is transcendent and it's holding those two together which we can in the form of the trinity

510
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:12,320
trinity the trinity is the best explanation of panentism that there is you know it's like the

511
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:19,120
image of a book what is a book is it the thing in the mind of the creator or is it the the volume

512
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:23,920
here on the table or is it what happens when that volume is taken up and read by somebody

513
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:30,320
the book is all three of those but in different senses and this is what roomy said in one of his

514
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:41,120
meditation the spirit is the well spring it is the cup that conveys the water and it is the water

515
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:46,480
that quenches the thirst of those who are thirsty so i just thought i'd throw that in because i think

516
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:54,160
it's one way of making panpsychism a much more interesting phenomenon a much closer to panentism

517
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:02,400
i agree i i think that the best model of ultimate reality is trinitarian and we find it in many

518
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:08,400
different traditions as my favorite book on this is david bentley hart's book the experience of god

519
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:17,120
being is bliss where he shows that the an indian model sat chit ananda is is one way of looking

520
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:23,040
at this and sat is the ground of all being that which sustains all things all being and chit is

521
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:30,400
consciousness which is contains names and forms namarupa names and forms that the contents of

522
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:36,160
consciousness has is consciousness about things and these names and forms it's roughly what play

523
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:42,560
to call you know the platonic realm of ideas in the christian trinity is the logos and then

524
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:49,120
ananda joy or bliss that the divine consciousness is blissful which is why mystical experiences of

525
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:55,440
union with god are usually blissful because the divine consciousness is blissful now in the christian

526
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:01,600
model where we have god the father is the ground of being and the logos as the the second person

527
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:08,480
the trinity the names and forms which give form shape structure coherence to everything which

528
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:14,240
underlie the order and form of the world and also the order and form of our minds which is why we

529
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:20,320
can the traditional view is why we can understand nature is because they have a common source their

530
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:26,720
minds and the natural world and then the holy spirit which is the dynamical moving principle

531
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,600
wind energy breath flames flying birds you know it's the dynamical principle

532
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:43,840
i find that the when we understand matter as a combination of form and energy with energy

533
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:50,480
according to physics matter like an electron or a proton or an atom are organized by quantum fields

534
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:56,320
which give form the energy within them is the same energy we see in light and light can turn

535
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:01,360
into matter and matter can turn into light energy is promiscuous and can take any form

536
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:08,960
so what we have in nature is a universal energy this is a scientific view as well as a religious

537
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:17,520
view and we have a whole range of possible forms that energy can take and the source of both

538
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:25,040
energy is is the ultimate being and the source of both and the primary metaphor is of course

539
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:31,760
speaking because when i speak i'm the speaker the words i'm saying have formed structure shape

540
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:38,000
connection with each other meaning and but in order to say them i have to be breathing up there

541
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,200
has to be a flow of air and if i have just the words they're silent in my mind if i have just

542
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:53,760
the flow of air it's a kind of white noise of undifferentiated energy but the two together

543
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,800
make the words which can then relate and communicate and give structure and meaning

544
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:04,960
so i think that this metaphor i find this particular metaphor of the holy trinity particularly

545
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:11,760
helpful yes yes well i'm glad i i would endorse every word of that but i thought that we might

546
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,600
segue from there to the relationship between energy and matter we know that they're interchangeable

547
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:26,000
and e equals mc squared is a the most famous expression of this idea and i'm i'm very interested

548
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:36,960
in your idea which i believe will be adopted by mainstream science eventually when they catch up

549
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:44,000
which is that there are form fields of energy possibly electromagnetic energy which govern

550
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:54,400
the shapes of things and are also the cause of memory so there are memories that are stored

551
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:01,440
in form fields i believe this this is something that you would you might want to

552
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:08,640
demur but i think this is my understanding um because of course i mean i'm sure people are

553
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:14,560
aware but when we we've done this heroic task of decoding the genome you know which i don't want to

554
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:23,280
diminish in any way it was a staggeringly um clever and and and some brilliant piece of work

555
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,120
but at the end of the day what we discovered this is almost nothing there i mean there's

556
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:34,000
absolutely there's not just not quite enough information as but by many many orders of magnitude

557
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,080
far far too little most things are just simply not there and it reminds me slightly of that

558
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:46,000
episode of faulty towers i think it's number five of the first series where um the chef gets drunk

559
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:53,200
and um basal faulty has to go off to a restaurant and and get a duck for the for the gala evening

560
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,520
and unfortunately somebody switches the the plates around and so he takes away what he

561
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:03,200
believes is a duck but is in fact a blamance and he walks into the dining room with this sort of

562
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:10,000
i've got it here now and then he goes voila takes off of it and there's a blamance and he goes

563
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:19,840
nothing there and i i sort of see this as the state we're in now that we we thought we've got it

564
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:26,800
but actually it's not there so on a more serious note you you sent me a couple of papers that i very

565
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:32,160
much enjoyed um one of them was fairly technical but it explained itself at the end and what it was

566
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:40,800
really saying is at the lowest level of neurons and uh transmitters and so on there is no stability

567
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:47,120
or there is little stability not enough stability to say that any kind of memory is stored in this

568
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:52,320
pattern of neurons or whatever because it shifts it shifts in the brain after very short while it

569
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:59,440
may go somewhere else so but what is stable is not the manifestation in the brain substance

570
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,840
but some kind of electromagnetic field now expand on that Rupert please

571
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:14,880
well and i think both genes and uh brains have long been overrated um and in in the in the 1970s

572
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,480
and 80s these human genes would explain everything which is why literally billions of dollars were

573
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:26,240
poured into the human genome project as you say when it came when it finished you know they thought

574
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,880
there'd be a hundred thousand genes that you'd be able to patent them and make fortune and stuff

575
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:38,480
there are only 20,000 and you know rice plants have about 45,000 and see a few more than us so

576
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:45,120
it's not it's not it wasn't at all what was expected and then all these attempts to explain

577
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:51,520
hereditary in genome-wide association studies we compare tens of thousands of people's genomes

578
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:56,240
and they look at their height and where they get breast cancer where they you know schizophrenia

579
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:02,800
etc what do the genes actually explain well they explain about 2.5 percent of the inheritance of

580
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:08,240
schizophrenia less than 10 percent of the inheritance of breast cancer less than 20 percent of the

581
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:15,440
inheritance of height and yet these things are known to be heritable and so the genes don't

582
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:23,520
explain it so that's called the missing heritability problem in the trade and they try people have

583
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,560
tried to fill that gap with epigenetics the inheritance of quiet characters which was as

584
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,480
you know taboo in the 20th century absolutely I think it depends on morphic resonance the

585
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:42,080
connection of the kind of memory across time as you know is one of my favorite theories

586
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:49,360
and the same goes for memories in the brain that morphic resonance depends on similarity

587
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:54,880
any organism is more similar to itself in the past than to any other organism

588
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:00,480
therefore the most specific resonance is from its own past I think this maintains the form

589
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,760
of organisms even though the cells and the molecules turn over I mean our own molecules

590
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:12,880
are changing time and cells coming and going but the form remains more or less the same

591
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,320
and in the realm of memory I think that we resonate with ourselves in the past and that's how memory

592
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:25,120
works that it's not stored as the materialists believe they have to believe that it's material

593
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,680
in the brain because they've got nothing but material to explain things and so it has to be

594
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:35,520
material traces and people have tried over and over and over again for more than a hundred years to

595
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:41,360
find these memory traces storing memories in brains and they've proved ever more elusive

596
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,960
and the paper you were referring to is where people have looked in mouse brains

597
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:52,480
inserting extremely detailed electrodes so you can get tremendously fine grain picture of what's

598
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,840
happening in the in the brain and we know that brains have waves going through them it's not

599
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:03,680
just granular nerve cell activity it's we've known from electroencephalographs for years that there

600
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:10,240
are global wave patterns what this new study shows is that these wave patterns are highly specific

601
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:16,080
and very particular patterns of waves when a mouse learns something and when it remembers it

602
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,800
and when they first discovered the characteristic wave patterns they said oh we've located the

603
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:27,280
memory here they are these waves in this bit of the brain that in between when learning and remembering

604
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:32,640
they must have been stored in the cells in material traces that somehow then come to life in the form

605
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:38,800
of waves again but then they found that the wave patterns remain the same when they remember it

606
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:44,800
the same pattern but the pattern can move to different bits of the brain it it's it's not

607
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:50,400
in particular cells it's it's the ability of the nervous tissue to produce wave patterns that

608
01:10:50,400 --> 01:11:00,240
underlies the memory and this is called representational drift so the standard theory of memory

609
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:05,440
just doesn't work and I think memory and the memory of form and the inheritance of form and

610
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:10,640
instinct I think instincts like habits of the species inherited by morphic resonance

611
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:17,840
um so I think that the the the standard materialist view trying to build it all up from granular

612
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:27,040
genes is simply falling apart through you know the um the inheritance problem um

613
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:31,680
the missing heritability problem and through things like representational drift and the

614
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:39,680
failure to find memories in the brain this of course has huge implications for consciousness

615
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:45,280
because the materialist view is that when we die if memories are all stored in the brain and the

616
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:52,480
brain decays then oblivion is the only possible outcome of death whereas all traditional belief

617
01:11:52,480 --> 01:12:00,080
systems have had some sort of life after death whether it's a shadowy ancestral realm in Hades

618
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:07,200
or whether it's you know life after death or whether it's reincarnation all of them involve

619
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:13,520
a transfer or survival of memory beyond the survive beyond the death of the brain all of those

620
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,720
possibilities are ruled out by the materialist theory which is why it so fits well with kind

621
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:26,080
of atheist worldview um because it rules out a lot of religion is about thinking about consciousness

622
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:32,640
in a big picture including the possibility of life after death or whether it's our consciousness

623
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:40,640
resorbed into the ultimate consciousness or whatever um it they all assume most religions

624
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:46,000
assume that it doesn't just stop when we die whereas the materialist theory of memory says

625
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:54,080
that's the only possible option quite quite but am i right in understanding i mean i know you like

626
01:12:54,080 --> 01:13:00,960
myself have had conversations with michael levin who is an evolutionary biologist at Tufts

627
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:08,160
um i think you've had conversations with him am i right yes yes i went to visit him actually i

628
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:15,840
admired him a few years ago when i was giving a talk at harvard i i went to um to visit him

629
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:22,080
and we we spent some time together in his lab and that was a purely private conversation but

630
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:29,600
did you find that there was um that he had moved towards i my sense is that he doesn't

631
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:35,120
actually want to embrace it fully or publicly but that he basically is a deeply sympathetic to

632
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:42,080
this way of thinking yes he is his his whole way of thinking is about holistic organizing

633
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:50,640
principles which are more for genetic fields that's my starting point um he's the the great

634
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:56,240
thrust of his work is that biology is organized by fields sort of top-down organization of the

635
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:02,560
development generation rather than building it up from the bottom from genes which simply doesn't

636
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:11,680
work no but there's a form of teleology or passive behavior in all living things that there's a

637
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:17,680
global organizing principles that are hierarchically organized and you've got cells within tissues

638
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:23,600
the cell has its own form of organization its own intelligence and the tissue containing millions

639
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:29,920
of cells as a higher level of organization and the organ a higher level still in the organism

640
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:37,280
and the society but this view is almost i mean it's very similar to what i i think and the one

641
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:43,040
thing he doesn't have is morphic resonance you see and um i he certainly knows about it because

642
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:48,480
when i went to visit him he pulled out a very well in thumb copy of my book a new science of life

643
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:54,800
my first about morphic resonance he asked me to sign it and and i know he's read it with great

644
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:00,560
attention and yes i mean he's very widely read i don't claim that i'm special privilege particularly

645
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:07,440
for me but or my book but um he's very widely read but he's certainly very aware of the holistic

646
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:13,840
tradition in biology very rooted in it and very very well aware of his history um you know going

647
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:22,320
back to the early 20th century people like greech and and the school i mean he's very aware of that

648
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:28,960
in a way that most biologists aren't and i think that he's hovering i think he'd love morphic

649
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:35,760
resonance to be true but he doesn't mention it he doesn't talk about it he doesn't do research on it

650
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:44,080
because he knows that this would mean he's at present has a very influential position within

651
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:50,320
biology it's he's very rare uh it's very rare for someone who has a holistic perspective to have such

652
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:58,080
wide influence in where molecular biology has dominated things for so long if he's started coming

653
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:05,120
out in favor of morphic resonance you know he'd be proclaimed a heretic like me and and this would

654
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:11,600
fall apart so if somebody else got good evidence for morphic resonance i think he'd be pleased and

655
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,480
i think he'd start doing work on it but i think he's in a position where he could take the lead

656
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:25,440
yes uh while you were talking about this intelligence of cells you know which is

657
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:31,680
something i'm very interested in i've written about in the matter with things um even a single cell

658
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:40,480
can inventively repair its own form although it's not programmed any rare in its genome to do so

659
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:48,160
and has no experience itself of such a repair being needed and in many ways that's a small

660
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:56,000
element in a picture which is much bigger which is in a good point that i think was made by um

661
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:04,800
fsc schiller or fcs schiller uh which is that when somebody's had a brain injury

662
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,600
how is it that other parts of the brain sort of know that they need to reconstitute this element

663
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:16,640
it is entirely different from anything that the machine can do because it involves a

664
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,680
conceptual pattern of the whole where it recognizes there's something that needs to be brought into being

665
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,680
rather like the idea of a representational drift there's another part of them on a much

666
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,760
bigger scale and more dramatically that one another area of the brain must be recruited

667
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:37,200
to do this job and that suggests that there is a form of what is going on at a higher level

668
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:44,960
which is exactly what they're finding in in the brain science of memory that you are talking about

669
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:53,680
so i think that's that's wonderful now that's why in the 1920s when the idea of morphogenetic

670
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:59,680
fields was first put forward people liked the field idea because if there's a field organizing

671
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:06,000
the development of an organism or a cell and if you damage it the field is still there which contains

672
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:15,040
wholeness and can account for regeneration and the analogy was with magnetic fields because

673
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,880
fields are intrinsically holistic even the fields of physics and after all fields were

674
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:27,280
only introduced into science by faraday in the 19th century in the 1850s before that it was

675
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:33,360
just purely mechanistic no pushing and pulling billiard balls and things although newton's

676
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:41,040
gravitational theory implied interconnectedness of the entire universe but the emphasis in classical

677
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:46,640
mechanics was on pushing and pulling and fields in a way are still involved in pushing and pulling

678
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:52,400
but um that they're through what i'm pulling than pushing i make a distinction i think the

679
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:57,840
things that push from behind are very mechanistic and hydraulic but that actually what we need to

680
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:03,200
be thinking about are those things both spiritually morally intellectually and biologically that draw

681
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:09,440
us from in front well yes of course magnetic fields push or pull if you put the same poles

682
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:14,960
together yes that's true but it's not symmetrical because if you shake up a whole lot of magnets

683
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:21,680
i sometimes do this for fun um they they automatically line up they repel each other

684
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:28,160
until they pull and so it's not that repulsion attraction comes out above repulsion because

685
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:35,040
you end up with interconnected magnet you don't end up with lots of repelled separate ones so

686
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:40,880
of course i love that they're repulsion and attraction are symmetrical in in an iron magnet

687
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:48,640
the rhythm is the domination of attraction and that sounds a very good point which to

688
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,000
um have a break

689
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:00,720
i have to sort of cut you off somewhere um because the conversation has been so wide

690
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:05,360
ranging and fascinating that you brought things out of each other um which is probably

691
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,240
you know new and fresh and that's what i think is so exciting about a dialogue

692
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:13,840
and where you have a creative interchange
