0	10720	What am I going to do this evening? I'm going to try to do the impossible. In the old days,
10720	15280	students used to have nothing very much to do at university, so they used to entertain themselves
15280	19520	with pranks, like how many people can you fit into a telephone box? And it's going to be a
19520	25520	little bit like that tonight. I'm going to see how many ideas I can cram into whatever time has
25520	32880	allowed me. I want to begin by talking a bit about what I call the hemisphere hypothesis,
34240	41760	the question of the difference between the hemispheres, but mainly as a portal to a further
41760	49920	exploration of reality. It seems to me that at the moment we're puzzled about reality because
50240	57840	there are messages that come to us, particularly from some areas of postmodernism, that there is no
57840	63520	such thing as truth. Everything is just whatever you make up. I don't believe that for an instant.
63520	70640	I believe passionately that we are truths. They are rarely simple and they may sometimes conflict
70640	77840	with one another. So it is hard to set up a program of them, but we can learn to look for them and be
77840	85200	more successful in finding them. And it's in that project that I've been writing for 30 years,
85840	90320	first the master and his emissary, and then the matter with things which came out a couple of
90320	98720	years ago. Well, less than that now, November 21. And in it I try to take strands from what we know
98720	106800	about the brain, what we know about our thinking patterns in consciousness, and what we know from
106800	114240	physics. These seem like three pretty core ways of looking into the nature of reality. I'm not
114240	121040	suggesting there is one single easy reality. I'm not suggesting there is one ever-knowable truth.
121040	128720	I'm suggesting we mustn't ever give up on the idea that it is worthwhile for a human life. In fact,
128720	136160	it is imperative for a human life to be searching for such a reality and such a truth. Otherwise,
136160	143280	we are frankly deluded. And I believe that much of the world I now live in is
143280	152480	suicidally deluded. But I come on to that later. Now, let me see. Oh, that's good. So this is a
152480	158560	quote from Pascal. The twofold nature of man is so evident that some have thought that we had two
158560	165280	souls. But he's not the only person to have said something like this. Kant said something like
165280	174720	this Schopenhauer, Bergson, Goethe, Nietzsche, the wonderful German philosopher Max Sch√§ler,
174720	182560	who in my view is underrated and underread these days. They all had this instinct that there were
182560	188960	two sort of almost people or points of view within us that were somewhat in conflict. Each could be
189760	195760	helpful for some things, but neither of them was complete in themselves. And in fact, incidentally,
195760	200880	in writing this book, I found that there are stories like the story of the master and his
200880	207680	emissary, which gave me the title of my earlier book 2009 from all around the world. The story I
207680	213360	took there was supposed to resituate the way in which we think about the left and right hemisphere.
213360	218240	When I was in medical school, it was said that the left hemisphere sort of was terribly important
218240	223520	because it controls the right hand with which you do the grasping, and it controls certain elements
223520	231040	of language, mainly speech, through which we say we grasp things. But actually, it turns out that
231040	238080	the right hemisphere is far, far more important for getting a hold on the world than the left
238080	242560	hemisphere. And indeed, when people have had a stroke, it is harder for them to recover from
242560	247360	a stroke in the right hemisphere than a stroke in the left hemisphere, even though the left
247360	254320	hemisphere's stroke often affects their speech and affects their ability to use their right hand.
256080	264960	So, I could say at this point that in the later book that I've written, The Mashable Things,
264960	270880	which came out, as I say, November 21, I begin by looking at what I call the various portals
270880	278560	through which we can get a grasp of the world at all, get some kind of understanding of it,
278560	284560	receive information from it. And I take it that those are attention, perception, which is not
284560	290400	the same as attention, judgment, the ideas we form on the basis of what we attend to and what we
290400	296880	perceive, emotional and social intelligence, cognitive intelligence, in other words, IQ,
297760	303280	and creativity, because that enters into our ability to interpret what it is we're seeing.
303280	310960	And in all of these, I demonstrate at length, over 400 pages, and I draw on 5,600 pieces of
310960	315920	research, I can demonstrate conclusively that all of these are better carried out by the right
315920	321760	hemisphere. It is more veridical, it is more intelligent, more perceptive, and much better
321760	325600	guide to reality. And when people have right hemisphere, damages has been commented on by
325600	331600	neurologists over the Easter century, they lose any sense of reality, they become deluded,
331600	338560	start hallucinating. And indeed, in schizophrenia, which is the topic that probably rings bells for
338560	343680	most people when one mentions delusions and hallucinations, what is going on there is something
343680	350640	like a defunct or deficient right hemisphere, which has been compensated for by an overactive
350640	357680	left hemisphere. Anyway, that's all by way of an introduction. But first of all, let me just ask
357680	362800	this question, most of you here will have heard something like this, what hemisphere differences,
362800	368400	that's all complete rubbish, that was all blown out of the water 30 years ago, it's all nonsense,
368400	374240	don't even listen to it. And there's a sort of circular thing that happens here, this is what
374240	379120	people were taught, so they never looked, because they never looked, they never found anything
379120	383920	different from what they've been told. So much later in their careers, they don't want to spend 30
383920	388400	years like me actually finding out what are the differences between the hemispheres, because it
388400	392160	would mean the end of their career, they'd be despised by their colleagues, they wouldn't get
392160	399760	promotion. So I'm afraid this is a question of a, and what you might call an urban myth,
400480	406320	it is an idea that itself needs powerfully to be debunked. If you don't believe me,
406320	412720	read my work, it is enormously well referenced, you can look up everywhere what it is that I'm
412720	418160	referring to, and why it is scientifically based. I'd just like to ask you three simple questions,
418160	424800	why is the brain divided? This is a picture by the Salius, and we were in Basel the other day,
424800	432240	and passed by accident a house, it said here lived the Salius. So in 1542, this slightly grumpy looking
432240	438480	man had the top of his head lifted off, and here you see the left hemisphere pushed slightly to
438480	443600	decide to expose this band of fibres at the base of the brain called the corpus callosum.
444560	450320	Why is the brain divided in this way? If the power of the brain is in making connections,
450320	456160	why have it so massively divided? And it's not just our brains, by the way, it's all the brains
456160	461200	we've ever looked at, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, right down to insects having separate
461200	467760	different ganglions. Wherever you look, and in fact, the oldest creature that we know has a neural
467760	474240	network, which is said to be the ancestor of the mammalian brain, a sea creature called nematosella
474240	480960	vectensis, the brain is the neural network is somewhat divided and asymmetrical, which is the
480960	486000	next thing I'm coming on to. Why is the brain asymmetrical? Here you're looking up at the base
486000	490880	of the brain, as if you were looking up your own spinal column, and you can see that the
491840	499200	right hemisphere, which is hopefully on the left, is larger than the corresponding frontal
499200	504160	layer of the left hemisphere. And similarly at the back, the left hemisphere is larger than the
504160	508720	right. When I was in medical school, that was always said to be because of language, but we
508720	514400	know it is nothing to do with language. It has become used by language now that the brain has
514400	520320	its expansion, that the expansion was not caused by language, because it's there in chimpanzees,
520320	525520	gorillas, orangutans, and other creatures that we've tried to teach language to and got nowhere.
527360	534720	And the third thing is the corpus callosum itself, this band of fibres, which only 2% of brain
534720	541840	fibres actually cross from one hemisphere to the other. It's rather wonderful, this suburban doorbell
541840	551440	suddenly coming in from the cosmic reaches. What I've got here is a normal human brain over, whoops,
551440	560480	there. And over here, I was very privileged, I got a slice through Donald Trump's brain,
560480	567520	and, oh no, sorry, it's a dog's brain. But anyway, what you see is that the dog's brain
567520	575440	is smaller than a human brain, quite a lot, but the corpus callosum, which is, if I can do this,
576080	582800	this, oh, band of fibres here, and the same thing in white over here, in the, whoops, in the,
584240	590720	there. The dog didn't have a drink. And so you can see that it's not as big
591600	597440	comparatively with the brain. So the corpus callosum is getting smaller over evolution,
597440	602160	and it only started in mammals, prior to mammals that wasn't a corpus callosum at all.
603280	608240	And get this, the main purpose of the corpus callosum is to inhibit, to tell one hemisphere
608800	615040	to the other one, keep out of it. Many of the fibres that cross the corpus callosum, for those
615040	620320	of you who are neuroscientists are excitedly, they're glutamatergic, but they abut on GABA
620960	631360	ergic neurons, which are functionally inhibitory. And that, why this might have a reference to
631360	636800	human culture is expanded in this book, The Master and His Emissive. Why would this have
636800	641520	anything to do with human culture? Well, I'm going to explain to you that the two hemispheres have
641520	646480	evolved to do completely different things. And in this book, I go into that and the philosophy of
646480	652000	it. But I also look at the history of human culture and suggest that there are times when we
652000	659520	have got these two aspects of our brains out of balance. I'll come on to that. Now, as was
659520	665280	mentioned by Amir, a central concept for me is attention. When I discovered that one of the
665280	670000	most important distinctions between the two brain hemispheres was the way in which they pay attention
670000	676560	to the world. It didn't immediately dawn on me why this was so significant, because I had been
676560	681840	trained in a mechanistic way of thinking about the brain, which was that attention is just another
681840	686400	cognitive function that can be measured in the lab, and it could be simulated by a machine.
686400	693200	A machine can be directed towards something, but it can't pay attention to it. And attention
693200	698640	is something very special indeed, because I believe it actually creates the world,
698640	705360	the only world that any of us can know is the world that comes into being for us. And that world
706160	713680	is a combination of something coming from us and something out there. And I believe that this is
713680	719680	a two way relationship. In fact, that all things in the cosmos have two way relationships are
719680	725600	reverberative in their nature. And I'm trying to get away from naive realism on the one hand,
725600	732400	and the naive idealism on the other. Naive realism, I call rot, that the reality is out
732400	738000	there, R-O-T. And that's just nonsense, that there's just a world out there and we record it
738000	744320	passively like a photographic plate or a sound recorder. No, something of us goes into what we
744320	749920	find there, which is why what we find there has some very general common ground, but it is not
749920	755040	identical in every experience, even by the same person, never mind by different persons.
755680	763760	But I also don't think that it is what you might call mumbo made up miraculously by ourselves,
763760	769680	M-U-M-B-O, which is the kind of postmodern idea that it's just a fantasy out of our brains.
769680	775200	It is something that happens between, in what I call a betweenness. And a betweenness is not
775200	781440	just a gap between. It is like an electric current. Where is the electric current? Is it in the
781440	786640	positive terminal? No. Is it in the negative terminal? No. It needs them. Is it in the space
786640	792480	between? No. It's in the whole ensemble. And betweenness is what happens when two things come
792480	800480	into a new unit and something comes about that is different from either of any of its component
800480	806880	parts, but subsumes them. So they're necessary but not sufficient. Now this is the mountain behind
806880	813520	my house. Its name derives from a Norse word, which means a sloping rock. And you can see why,
813520	821680	because from the sea, this mountain was a signal to the Vikings who came there a thousand years ago
821680	828000	that this was a very dangerous bay in which they would be shipwrecked. So to them, this mountain
828080	833360	was a landmark that meant life and death. But there were people here before the Vikings. There
833360	838480	were the Picts and they've left their broths, their stone houses. And we know that for them,
839200	844880	this mountain was the home of the gods. Then in the 18th century, people came to draw and paint in
844880	849760	Scotland. It's a very beautiful landscape. And they would have seen this as a many-coloured,
849760	855920	many-textured form of beauty. And then in the 19th century, people came and they were interested
856000	861120	in geology. And it just happens to be an extremely good example of columnar basalt formation.
862560	866720	So to all these people, it was something different. And then to a physicist, you ask a physicist what
866720	876080	it does. But 99.99% of it is empty space. And the other bit, 0.01%, we don't really know what it is
876080	882880	after all. So which of these is the real mountain, I ask you. Now my answer to that is that no one
882880	887280	of them is the full story. But each of them is the real mountain. Each of them is a real way of
887280	891440	looking at the mountain. And if you say to me, yeah, but come on, it's just a big lump of rock.
891440	897440	That already is a very specialist way of looking at it, which betrays your values and your particular
897440	903360	narrowness of way of viewing. Because it's many, many things. If you apply that across the world,
903360	909520	you realise that attention is a creative act. Attention is a moral act. Because what you make
909600	915040	of the world is something that really comes out. When I attend to you in a certain way,
915040	923120	I can bring something that is warm, good, beneficent, perhaps healing as a good therapist or
923120	928640	doctor might be able to do. If I pay attention to you in a clinically detached way, I can make
928640	934880	you feel very small, very alien, and so on. We create the world around us. We actually make
934880	942560	things through our attention. So how you attend matters, because it forms up like this. Once you
942560	947680	start looking in one way, you find only the bits of the world that respond to the way you look.
947680	952640	The world is a machine. So you look at it. This is mechanical. That's mechanical. The other is
952640	957520	mechanical. The whole thing is a machine. But that's because looking at it as a machine,
957520	963760	all you see are the bits that respond to that mechanistic view. And if you do, you then start
964400	969040	to look further in this same way, thinking that was a good start. And now you just harden up. So
969040	974560	after a few decades, it's very difficult to break out of a habit of mind that we are instilling
974560	980880	into people in the West, which was never held at any other time in human history, never held in
980880	985680	other parts of the world and the West until very recently, and is extremely odd.
986640	992240	This is the kind of attention paid by the left hemisphere targeted on something. The reason that
992240	996960	we have these two hemispheres, you measure why do we have these two hemispheres, is because the
996960	1005040	left is good at one thing only. It's much better than the right at grabbing, at grasping. And even
1005040	1013520	the processes whereby we say we have grasped something, we have big glyphin, or indigene,
1014320	1025760	or indeed, comprendre, is to grasp hold of, or apprehend, is to grasp onto. Comprehend is probably
1025760	1030160	different. It's sort of see the whole together, which is what the right hemisphere alone can do.
1030160	1037920	But this is how the left hemisphere looks at the world. A leads to be job done. But the broad view
1037920	1042560	of the right hemisphere sees that A and B are connected, but not as directly as you thought,
1042560	1049360	and that the system is living, hence the birds and the tree, and complex, not just complicated.
1051840	1056160	You may say it's very facile to talk about one hemisphere as a whole. And of course,
1057040	1061600	I am neurologically trained. I'm psychologically trained. I know that there are different areas
1061600	1065520	in the brain. I know they have different functions. If you read my writing, you will find that the
1065520	1071600	different areas do. But it is also now known that instead of thinking in a modular way about the
1071600	1078880	brain, we should be thinking more in terms of whole networks. And indeed, when you excite one part of
1079920	1086080	the left or the right hemisphere, there will be excitations that spread much more widely
1086080	1090480	throughout that hemisphere. And this is to show you a couple of, sort of, if you like,
1091120	1096720	superhighways of transmission, the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the insonant fasciculus,
1096720	1101280	showing connections between the posterior part of the brain and the frontal lobes and between
1101280	1108000	the frontal lobes and the temporal lobe. So this pains me. I'm going to do something
1108000	1114880	it's extremely simple-minded and much more black and white than I would like it to be. But because
1114880	1120400	I just don't have time, you'll have to take it as a bit of a caricature, but broadly speaking,
1121440	1126080	it is what you can accept. And if you want to know the finesse and all the details,
1126080	1137040	then read my books. So there are various differences. And one is that the left, I put the left hemisphere
1137040	1142960	version on the left and the right hemisphere version on the right. And in these dichotomies,
1142960	1148640	there are somewhat false dichotomies because nothing can be cut and dried when it comes to
1148640	1154080	anything as complicated as the brain. But nonetheless, there are strong tendencies
1154080	1161760	for the right hemisphere to be able to apprehend new experiences of whatever kind, new music,
1161760	1168240	new person, new shape, whatever it might be. Whereas the left hemisphere latches on to what
1168240	1174080	is already known and familiar because it's looking for food. It's looking for things to pick up
1174080	1181520	with its right hand. And the evolutionary point here is that if you're only attending to food
1182160	1187840	and a twig to build a nest and all the utilization of the world, the manipulation of the world,
1187840	1193040	which the left hemisphere is good for, you'll soon be eaten by another creature while you're
1193040	1197680	getting your own lunch, because you need to be looking out for predators, for your mate,
1197680	1204880	for your constasifics. And so you have to have some part of your brain that is holding the whole
1204880	1210160	picture together while you go about grabbing and picking what you know. It prefers what is certain
1210160	1215280	to what is possible. In other words, it likes things to be cut and dried, black and white.
1215280	1225760	Whereas the right hemisphere is more open to ambiguity. The left hemisphere prefers fixity.
1226960	1232640	It likes to fix things. And literally, when people have a certain kind of damage to the right
1233600	1240400	posterior hemisphere, they begin to see normal flow of motion broken up into
1242160	1250400	like a sort of an old fashioned cine film that's got stuck or stop go animation.
1251760	1256080	Because after all, it's targeting something and wants to catch it. So it fixes it and picks it up.
1256080	1260720	So it sees a lot of static bits, whereas the right hemisphere sees that everything is flowing.
1261680	1265920	The left hemisphere sees parts where the right hemisphere sees the whole.
1266960	1271120	The right hemisphere has the body image in it, which is the whole image of the body and all
1271120	1279680	modalities. The left hemisphere has a nose, an elbow, a knee, a foot. Explicit versus implicit.
1279680	1284960	So the left hemisphere understands what is explicit, what if you have a dictionary and a grammar,
1284960	1290560	and perhaps a computer could put them together. But all that is implicit, which is nine tenths
1290560	1298160	of what matters to us, things like love and a sense of the sacred and the meaning of music
1298160	1305040	and the understanding of poetry, the understanding of humor, sarcasm, irony, all these things that
1305040	1312000	change the way the world is to be interpreted are taken at face value by the left hemisphere,
1312000	1317680	though understood by the right. The left hemisphere tends to abstract things from their context.
1317680	1321120	And if you take things out of their context, they change their meaning completely.
1321840	1326560	And the best way to understand something is to see it in the context, which makes it what it is.
1326560	1332400	Nothing is something outside of its context. The context is what actually creates it,
1333040	1339200	which is one of the reasons I say that relations are prior to things. The title of my later book
1339200	1344800	is the matter with things, which is a pun about our obsession with matter and our obsession with
1344800	1352400	things. But things, I say, arise secondarily out of a web of relationships. They are the things
1352400	1358640	that catch our attention. They are the little hubs where things cross, but actually they are
1358640	1365600	only what they are because of their relations. In abstracting, it turns whatever it has into a
1365600	1370160	general case, not a unique one. And here, because I'm in Switzerland, this first time I've ever
1370160	1376880	talked about this with two wonderfully described cases, rather sad cases. One is of a woman who
1376880	1384080	spent her whole life describing and writing about the birds of Switzerland. And you have a wonderful
1384720	1392880	bird life here in Switzerland. And she had a right posterior temporal parietal stroke.
1393360	1401680	And afterwards, she said, all the birds look the same. This is pretty tragic. And another is a
1401680	1408160	case of a farmer, Swiss farmer, who knew all his cattle by name. But after a stroke, he had difficulty
1408160	1414880	telling a cow from a horse. So you see, it deals in very broad categories, but the right hemisphere
1414880	1420240	sees the unique case, sees the ewness of you, and the vesseness of your friend.
1422720	1427360	The left hemisphere is mainly interested in how much of something the right hemisphere mourn,
1427360	1435200	but how, what is the quality of it? Naturally, this world becomes inanimate. And the right
1435200	1440400	hemisphere sees the animosity. And you can actually isolate one hemisphere at a time,
1440400	1446880	painlessly, experimentally, using something called transcranial magnetic stimulation. And if you
1447920	1455360	suppress the right hemisphere, people see what they would normally think of as living as inanimate.
1455360	1460800	If you suppress the left hemisphere, they see things that we would normally think of as inanimate,
1460800	1468000	like the sun, as a living being. The left hemisphere is remarkably optimistic,
1468080	1474000	ridiculously optimistic. Again, you can isolate one hemisphere at a time. And this is done sometimes
1474000	1482480	prior to brain surgery. And it's called the WADA test. And while one hemisphere is isolated,
1482480	1486320	the other one is not contributing. It lasts for about 15 minutes. During that time,
1487280	1492480	some psychologists administered a personality inventory to the subject and also to the subject's
1492480	1498080	relatives and friends and discovered that the left hemisphere has a very high opinion of itself
1498080	1502960	compared with what other people think. But when it was the right hemisphere's turn, the right hemisphere
1502960	1507920	was a little bit too negative about itself, but more realistic. And the most extraordinary
1509040	1514560	demonstration of this is denial. This is terribly important because I believe we now live in an age
1514560	1521600	of denial. All around us, we are denying a whole host of things, trying to not see them at all or
1521680	1528960	saying the opposite is the case. And this is very literal. After the left hemisphere stroke,
1528960	1534160	somebody may have a paralyzed right arm or right leg, and they'll be very unhappy about this. They
1534160	1540080	will weep about it, complain to the doctor. But if they've had a stroke in the right hemisphere and
1540080	1545520	the left side is paralyzed, they may completely deny there's anything wrong. So you can see them in
1545520	1549120	the morning after they come into the stroke in the night and say, how are you? And they say,
1549920	1554880	fine. They say, oh, that's very good. And any difficulty moving anything? No, no. Can you move
1554880	1559600	your left arm? Yep. Can you show me? And they go there, but nothing actually moved. And if you
1559600	1564320	bring it round in front of them and say, move that, they say, that's not my arm. That belongs to that
1564320	1571040	person over there, or it belongs to you, doctor. And the most important, but least exciting,
1571040	1576880	perhaps, of this list is the difference between something that is truly present and something
1576960	1582480	that is represented. Now, represented literally means presented again, after which is no longer
1582480	1590400	present, is therefore already past finished dead. And presenting is something that we don't allow
1590400	1595280	the world to do nowadays, because we're so quick with our representations. Oh, it's one of those.
1595280	1600640	It's a picturesque scene. It's a lake. It's a car. It's a water. We don't, only if we practice
1600640	1610800	mindfulness, are we able to get back to that state in which we are fully present and the world
1610800	1619600	is fully present to us? Okay, that's because I didn't know how to build that slide. Hello.
1619600	1626080	Yes, we've heard from you before. Now, so effectively, what you've got here, I'd like
1626080	1631200	to draw this together. So you see the kind of world that the left hemisphere brings into being
1631200	1638000	for us. It's effectively, I think we may have more problems with my poor skills at building slides,
1638000	1644320	but let's see. Ooh, that's all right. So first of all, you've got a world in what we take for reality.
1644320	1656560	Better?
1665280	1666880	Yeah, yeah. Has it stopped working?
1667120	1674960	Well, it's been very quiet all along. I'd have liked it to be louder, but I'm not a technician.
1679280	1682320	No, I'm fine. Oh, that's better. That's a bit too much.
1682320	1696800	Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So first of all, what we take to be reality is in fact,
1696800	1704160	just a representation, a map, a picture, a diagram, but not the complex living home.
1705120	1712880	One that is, in fact, made up of isolated things, things moreover than known, familiar,
1712880	1720800	decontextualized, fixed, predetermined, and made up of bits, fragments, disembodied,
1720800	1728000	having no meaning or coherence until we give it to them, where all is abstract,
1728960	1735680	generic in nature, infinitely reproducible and quantifiable, and therefore inanimate
1737360	1743680	and mechanical. And the future is a fantasy which would be only better if we could get
1743680	1754400	more of it under our control. Whereas, in the right hemisphere, one sees that nothing is ever
1754480	1760720	entirely certain or predictable, that all things are ultimately interconnected,
1761520	1767600	that there is nothing that is ever fixed, but in fact that, as Heraclitus said, everything flows,
1769280	1774800	that what exists are holds, the parts are an artifact of the left hemisphere's way of looking at
1774800	1783520	it, that meaning is implicit, and that the world of uniqueness is real, not just categories that
1783520	1788880	can be quantified, but having different qualities, and an essentially animate world.
1789760	1795200	And here there's a future that is a product of realism, not denial. We've got one
1795840	1801840	hemisphere that sees just a theory of the world, it's very simple and pleasing and is only going
1801840	1810080	to get better. The right hemisphere is seeing the whole embodied, impassioned business of vitality
1810080	1814000	and seeing that it is not necessarily leading somewhere we want to go.
1815680	1820160	And there is a relationship between the brain and the structure of the cosmos.
1822160	1826640	That's something I'm going to try and explain now. There is a sort of hierarchy of the right
1826640	1831200	and left, let me say this first of all. I think I've explained that the right hemisphere is more
1831280	1839920	veridical, that it is a better transmitter of producer of reality, and the left hemisphere
1839920	1846640	has certain limited uses. What it sees is not wrong, it's not that it's got no use,
1846640	1852320	it's just that its use is very limited and its knowledge is limited. The problem only becomes
1852320	1857600	when it thinks it knows more and we pay attention to that very narrow way of thinking as though it
1857600	1862320	gives us the full picture, which it doesn't. So there's a hierarchy there and I think this is
1862320	1868560	also demonstrable in physics, I've explained that. And I would say that when we're talking about
1868560	1873760	how we would like to make a world, it's a fantasy for us to imagine that we can just make up a world
1873760	1880160	without understanding both our own brains and the cosmos. And so this is where we need to start from
1880160	1882560	in all our exercises of imagination.
1886960	1893600	In whatever exists, there is a replication of this thing about the brain, which is that the
1893600	1899360	left hemisphere tends to divide in order to understand, but then cannot put it together again.
1899360	1906320	But the right hemisphere tends to see the whole and see the whole picture of which what the left
1906320	1911360	hemisphere has been looking at is just a part. Now, we need both these kinds of attention,
1911360	1915840	but one of them is more important than the other, the capacity to see the whole.
1916560	1923520	And there are these forces for division and forces for union throughout the physical cosmos as well
1923520	1930560	as the metaphysical one. And what we need is the unity of the forces of division and union,
1930560	1937840	not the division of the forces of division and union. Do you understand? I sometimes say we
1937840	1949280	don't want either, either or or both and we need both either or and both and. I hope that's entirely
1949280	1959600	clear. So this idea of the unity of difference and unity is the first asymmetry. The cosmos is founded
1959600	1968560	on asymmetry. So this is all played out in this recent book of mine in two volumes,
1969440	1978400	1300 pages of text, 1500 all together. Now it's based on this idea that science and philosophy
1978400	1983920	should never have been divorced. The word science in English only began being used to
1983920	1990720	specialize meaning in 1830. Until then science meant knowledge. And indeed what we call science
1990720	1997600	is called natural philosophy because in fact, what scientists don't see anymore is there is no such
1997600	2004240	thing as just looking because the way you attend the preconceptions of which you attend alters
2004240	2009680	what you find. If you don't know anything about philosophy, you just think it's obvious that
2009680	2015840	everything is mechanical because that is the philosophy of our age. That is what people suck up
2015840	2022480	from all around them as they grow, that everything is mechanical, but it is not actually mechanical.
2022480	2028960	Organisms in particular are not like machines in at least eight ways which I explain in this book.
2028960	2033520	And here I'm quoting from my favorite English philosopher of the last 100 years, the antagonism
2033520	2039360	between science and metaphysics is like all family quarrels being disastrous and from calling
2039360	2044480	words science and metaphysics are inextricably united and stand all four together. Any of you
2044480	2052400	who hear a scientist, please take that away and think about it. It does matter. And one of the
2052400	2059680	things that I wanted to talk about was the centrality of attention to what comes into existence. I've
2059680	2066560	talked a bit about that already. Then the coincidence of opposites. Now to our way of thinking now,
2066560	2072480	how can opposites coincide? It sounds impossible. We're taught at school that if it's this then
2072480	2077840	the opposite is as far away from it as possible. But this is not the case actually because mental
2077840	2083840	space, metaphysical space and indeed physical space is curved. It's not linear. And the further
2083840	2088320	you go in a certain direction, the more you find yourself coming back to what you are running away
2088320	2097840	from. It's a truism that anarchy leads to tyranny, that something extreme gives rise to its opposite
2097840	2103120	because it has its opposite in it. I've always thought that politicians is extreme left and
2103120	2107440	extreme right. You can hardly get a razor blade between them. They've got the same mentality
2107440	2114000	which is to miss all the shades, the complexities, the subtleties of human existence.
2114960	2121600	And I've already mentioned that I believe that relations come before a lot of the things that
2121600	2126800	are related. And then I just want to say something about limit cases being inverted. This is my view
2126800	2135360	of reality that in the old world, in the old world of physics, we thought that this was a
2135360	2141040	Newtonian world, that things are naturally static and they don't move unless they're given a push.
2141120	2145440	But now we know that there is nothing that is actually static in the entire cosmos. Everything
2145440	2152400	is in motion and stasis would be the limit case of motion, not motion, the limit case of stasis.
2153360	2161120	Representation is the limit case of what is actually real. Total independence is the limit
2161120	2167120	case of interdependence because everything is interdependent. There is no such thing as total
2167120	2172880	independence but if it exists at all, it will be the limit case of the norm which is interdependence.
2173680	2181280	Discontinuity is not the norm which then gets connected. Continuity is the norm. You may say
2181280	2187440	why do you say that? I can quote physicists who say this. Metaphysically, I believe it to be the
2187440	2195200	case. From observation of the world, I believe it to be the case. But discontinuity is the limit
2195200	2202720	case of the continuous. The explicit is not the norm and the implicit, some very strange thing that
2202720	2210800	happens in a poem. Implicit is what all our knowledge is. Explicit knowledge is a very special case
2210800	2220480	that we learn how to say in words through the process of education. The literal is the limit
2220480	2226960	case of the metaphorical. Everything is metaphorical. Even the words, in fact, particularly the words
2226960	2231040	used by science and philosophy, a point that has been made by philosophers themselves,
2231680	2237120	are based on metaphors because they're dealing in an abstract realm and they therefore have to draw
2237120	2242320	things from a real world. In fact, the word abstract is itself, something that means being
2242320	2248960	dragged away. I mean, it's very physical. So meaning is effectively metaphorical and the
2248960	2253680	literal is only a special case of the metaphorical in which you privilege one kind of meaning.
2254480	2259200	Randomness, which actually doesn't exist anywhere in the cosmos, would merely, if it existed,
2259200	2266640	be the limit case of order, which is everywhere. Simplicity represents a special case of complexity
2266640	2275360	because the more you go down, even into the quantum vacuum, this is the simplest thing that we know.
2275440	2280480	According to David Tong, Professor of Physics at Cambridge, it's unbelievably complex.
2281760	2287680	Simplicity is what we make when we clear away all the complexity. Ah, I've got a mechanism.
2287680	2294960	How lovely. That gives me a little tweak power. The determinant is the limit of the indeterminate.
2294960	2301280	Everything is actually ultimately indeterminate, but in very special cases, if you take the window
2301280	2306960	narrow enough, you can say it looks determinate. And straight lines are the limit case of curves,
2306960	2312320	not curves, some special case of straight lines. So all that exists is a kind of form.
2312320	2316720	And in the words of Whitehead, beyond all questions of quantity, there lie questions
2316720	2322320	of pattern, which are essential to the understanding of nature. And form is a matter of tension.
2324560	2327760	Can I go back? Yes. This is from my favorite
2328720	2332960	presocratic philosopher, Heraclitus, or my favorite philosopher, frankly,
2332960	2338240	they do not understand how a thing agrees with variance at variance with itself.
2339440	2344880	It is an attunement turning back on itself like that of the bow and lair. What did he mean?
2344880	2350640	He meant that things are always in balance of their opposites, that wherever something exists,
2350640	2358240	its dark side, the other end of it is there as well. And that what you look for is not to collapse
2358240	2364640	this creative tension into just this or just that, but to hold the tension. For us, this is
2364640	2368880	uncomfortable. Therefore, we try to collapse it. Oh, it's just that or it's just that. No,
2368880	2376080	you have to hold the two opposites. And the bow and the lair is the string of the bow,
2376080	2382560	the string of the lair gives rise to the note that gives rise to the flying arrow. And if you
2382560	2387840	let that tension go slack and didn't pull into opposite directions, pulling in opposite directions
2387840	2392320	is logically a waste of time. But actually, it's essential to everything that exists,
2392320	2397360	because this tension is creative. You want to make a good apple pie, you don't get boring,
2397360	2401120	bland apples, you get nice tart apples and put lots of honey with it.
2402080	2409680	And this is one of his deepest sayings, grasping, which means the coming together of things,
2409680	2416320	hose and not holes, convergent, divergent, constant dissonant from all things one,
2416320	2420400	and from one thing all. I would love to have time to unpack that for you, but
2421680	2427920	take it away and read it and think about it. And that relates to the idea of one and all.
2427920	2432320	I have a chapter on the coincidental or positive or on the coincidence opposites,
2432320	2438080	and a chapter on the one and the many. And I say it is wise, or he says it is wise,
2438080	2444160	listening not to me, but to the logos, which is like the founding ground of being,
2444160	2449840	to agree that all things are one. And I foot in brackets and that the one is all things,
2449840	2455040	because the Greek grammar allows this ambiguity of dual interpretation.
2456000	2462240	As I say, he also, and this is the second important point about physics, is that everything flows.
2462240	2466640	That's not the same as everything changes. There is a Buddhist saying that everything changes.
2466640	2472320	It's good as far as it goes, but everything flows is better, because not only does it suggest
2472320	2476560	there's a difference between the meaning of flow and just the succession of things,
2477120	2482640	but also it contains within it the important idea that when things flow,
2482640	2489680	they both are different and the same. The river that flows by my house is always the same river,
2489680	2494800	but the water is always different. And Heraclitus said famously, you can't step into the same water
2494800	2502240	twice. But that is beautiful, because he also said by changing things remain the same.
2502240	2506320	See, this very interesting idea that comes from observing the flow,
2506320	2510080	that in the flowing it remains what it is, but it also becomes something other.
2510960	2516880	Then here is Democritus, another early Greek philosopher. The cause of coming into being of
2516880	2522080	all things is the vortex. The vortex, of course, is a whirlpool. And this is terribly important,
2522720	2530000	because, well, this is about flow really. This is David Tong again from Cambridge.
2530000	2535360	At a fundamental level, nature is nature discreet or continuous. I see no evidence,
2535360	2540400	whatever for discreteness. All the discreteness we see in the world is something which emerges
2540400	2546080	from an underlying continuum. Contra are emergent, they're not built into the heart of nature.
2546080	2550080	So there we need discontinuity and we need continuity, but continuity
2550960	2555680	trumps, if you like, discontinuity. It is able to overarch the two.
2557760	2562880	And here is the vortex. And there's various interesting things about the vortex. First
2562880	2568880	of all, if you look at a whirlpool in a stream, a whirlpool is photographed or measurable. It can
2568880	2576720	move stones. Is it in the water? No, it's not in the water like the stone is in the water. It is
2576720	2584000	water. For that moment, it is that water. And I believe that beings, including every one of you
2584000	2590160	here, if you think about your nature and your being, you are like this whirlpool in that you are not
2590160	2596480	distinct from whatever it is that constitutes as a sort of indigestible lump. You are from
2596480	2601760	something that is already there, that takes the form you take at the moment. And when you go,
2601760	2607200	it will be passed on and will still be part of the flow of the river. So there are various things
2607200	2615600	about vortex. One is that it has the nature of a spiral, as you see. And spiral staircases are
2615600	2622640	very important because they are a good image of how we progress in life. TS Eliot said that the end
2622640	2627680	of all our voyaging is to return to the point where we started from and know it for the first time.
2628480	2633920	But that's not actually true. We don't ever return. We can't ever return to the point we started from
2633920	2639200	because it's gone. We come back somewhere higher on the spiral and look down at where we had been
2639280	2644320	before. But nonetheless, the progress is in one sense circular, but it's also up.
2647680	2653040	And this is Jacob's Ladder, as depicted by the poet and painter William Blake,
2653040	2658240	romantic poet and painter. And it's the only Jacob's Ladder I know, which shows it not as a
2658240	2663440	straight line to heaven, but as a spiral that climbs in this way forever.
2664080	2675680	And this is really just to say, if you look at a spiral down its axis, you see a perfect circle,
2675680	2681280	which is static and eternal. But if you look along the side of the spiral, you see that it's
2681280	2687520	actually not a particle, but a waveform, and that it is extending somewhere in space. It has
2687520	2695920	circularity, recurrence and newness in one. This is just to show that in flow, there is always
2695920	2701040	movement, which is reciprocal. That's one of the things that flow gives rise to.
2702880	2709920	And these are rather interesting. These are photographs taken of the flow in water.
2709920	2720640	And what has been done is simply a straight line of rectangular rods that are rectangular in cross
2720640	2728400	section immersed in the stream. So absolute rigidity, straight pieces, bars in a line.
2728400	2734080	And what you get is this completely wonderful creative newness, which flows and changes.
2734320	2744240	This is something called the Karman Vortex Street, which is created by an obstruction simply stuck
2744240	2750400	into the flow of water. And it results in this amazingly beautiful form. This is suggesting that
2750400	2756480	flow and the obstruction of flow are creative. In my philosophy, resistance to flow is as
2756480	2762240	important as flow. Resistance is creative. Without resistance, nothing can happen. What is friction?
2762880	2768640	It's what stops movement, but it's also what starts movement. Without friction, I can't take a step.
2769200	2775040	So these things come together in this way. And this is from Leonardo. He's showing an old man
2775040	2781120	leaning on a stick in the water. And there he shows the patterns that follow, which he describes as
2781120	2790320	like braided hair coming from the stick. And the most beautiful ratio on which many aesthetic
2792800	2798640	figures and pictures and so on are based is the so-called golden section, which is asymmetric.
2799440	2805760	It has this interesting asymmetry built into it. And this is just to say that each of those rectangles
2805760	2813680	is in relation to the next rectangle in the ratio of 1 to 1.61, which is roughly speaking,
2813680	2821200	that of the golden ratio. And it relates to a spiral. Here you can see the generation of the
2821200	2828720	spiral out of it. This spiral is, again, part of the asymmetry of nature. And they're both going
2829680	2835200	forward from something, but completing something at the same time. These are snowflakes. They are all
2836000	2845600	the random, we say, expression of form. They are all beautifully, in one sense, themselves,
2845600	2851840	but they are also fractal. So as you go down the stem, you see further expressions, which are of the
2851840	2860400	overall nature of the whole snowflake. And this is fractality, which is another expression
2860400	2869360	of difference in unity. So there is a unity. And as you go down into it, and things differentiate,
2869360	2876080	they become more and more versions of the same thing in the way that beautiful things often have
2876080	2889280	this asymmetry built into them. I mentioned the golden ratio. But here is an example,
2889280	2895040	so many of them from Japanese art, where there is both symmetry and asymmetry. And get this,
2895040	2903680	it's not just asymmetry that matters. It's the asymmetry of symmetry with asymmetry. Look at that.
2903680	2907520	In a way, it is symmetrical, but in an important way, it's also asymmetrical.
2908240	2913840	And it's the coming together of these two opposites that creates beauty. This is very profound in
2913840	2920400	beauty. Here is Palladier's villa, the Villa Capra, now known as the Villa Rotonda,
2922320	2931280	in the region of Vicenza Padua. And you see that in this, in some ways, very formally perfect,
2931360	2942240	symmetrical facade. There are little signs of life. There are these figures that these figures
2942240	2948880	that are living and asymmetrical. And here there is a goat, which was the coat of arms of the
2948880	2956640	Capra family. And so it has a sense of the beautiful symmetry, but complemented by asymmetry.
2956640	2961840	Now look at this, which is a copy of it basically, built at the University of Virginia by Thomas
2961840	2972480	Jefferson, who is a not inconsiderable architect. It's just symmetrical. I had to put that in,
2974000	2979040	because there's asymmetry and symmetry and the asymmetry of symmetry and asymmetry.
2980960	2985440	So something about sameness and difference is very important. We don't just want
2985440	2992480	difference or sameness, but both together. And this is from Goethe, from his father,
2993680	3000400	dividing the united, uniting the divided is the very life of nature. This is the eternal
3000400	3007760	cistern and diasterly, the eternal coalescence and separation, the inhalation and exhalation
3007760	3014960	of the world in which we live and where our existence is woven. And cistern and diasterly
3014960	3022240	are the two beats of the heart, cisterly is the lup and diasterly is the dup of relaxation.
3024400	3031440	Now, just to finish on physics, I wanted to quote Pasteur, who of course was a biologist,
3032080	3037120	the universe as a whole is asymmetrical. And I've come to believe that life, as it is
3037120	3046960	manifest, is a function of the asymmetry of the universe. I would even say that living
3046960	3053040	species are primordially in their structure, in their external forms, functions of the cosmic
3053040	3062000	asymmetry from his inaugural lecture in 1854 at Lille. And here, some 40 years later,
3062720	3069200	is Pierre Cooley, of course, a great physicist, certain elements of symmetry may coexist with
3069200	3074800	certain phenomena, but they're not necessary. What is necessary is that certain elements of
3074800	3081040	symmetry do not exist. It is asymmetry which creates the phenomenon, the effects produced maybe
3081040	3090080	more symmetrical than the causes. And I just put this here, in 1956, this Chinese lady made this
3090080	3097440	discovery of the violation of parity, which means the left and right hand are not symmetrical,
3097440	3101200	in the case of the weak interaction, all the other forces that have been discovered were
3101200	3107360	symmetrical, but then she discovered this is asymmetrical. And I'm sorry to report to you that
3108080	3112480	about three or four years later, two men got the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
3112480	3119920	There we are. Now, what has this got to do with the world we live in? I'm going to do this very
3119920	3128000	quickly, you'll be glad to know. I believe that over the course of the history of the West,
3128000	3133920	we've gone through phases. In the Greek civilization, there was a sudden efflorescence of everything,
3133920	3139840	of the arts, of the sciences together. Then in the Roman world, there was something similar.
3140400	3146000	And in each of those cases, it tailed off over 300 or 400 years and that civilization disappeared.
3146000	3151920	And then again, in our age, the sudden eruption of wonderful working together of the right and
3151920	3156320	left hemisphere, which are both necessary for science. In fact, the more important one is the
3156320	3161120	right hemisphere. So don't ever quote Mia saying that left hemisphere is science and the right
3161120	3167120	hemisphere is the arts. We need both for both. And in both cases, the right hemisphere asymmetrically
3167120	3175280	is more important than the left, even in science. I believe that in our world, like those worlds,
3175280	3180000	in which I've shown in the second part of the masternism, that things have drifted further
3180000	3185200	and further to the left hemisphere point of view, it's happening to us now. Now, if I'm right, let's
3185200	3195280	do a little fantasy. Let's imagine that actually, the left hemisphere was the only one we were
3195280	3201040	listening to. What would the world look like? Well, there'll be a loss of the broader picture.
3202560	3208880	Knowledge would be replaced by information's tokens or representations of true understanding.
3208880	3213920	Wisdom wouldn't get anywhere near it because wisdom is much too unmeasurable. The product of a
3213920	3218000	properly lived human life has nothing there that the left hemisphere can get hold of.
3218800	3224400	Can't be operationalized. There'll be the loss of the concepts, therefore, of skill and judgment,
3224400	3231520	which are essential to being a fully functioning human being. They'd all be taken over by machines
3231520	3236800	that had algorithms and things like that. So we'd spend hours talking to machines and getting nowhere
3236800	3241680	instead of talking to people who would exercise skill and judgment. I'd hate to live in that world.
3242320	3248000	And there'll be simultaneous abstraction and reification. So one of the same time,
3248000	3252640	things would become more and more abstract. The stuff you read would have more and more
3252640	3258240	abstract nouns in it. It wouldn't refer to reality. At the same time, matter would become just lump
3258240	3263520	and matter. I always say that materialists are not people who overvalue matter but undervalue
3263520	3267760	matter because matter is very, very special. Even if you believe there is only matter, then you've
3267760	3272640	got to accept that matter gave rise to Bach's and John's passions. So it's pretty amazing stuff.
3274000	3278080	Bureaucracy would have a field day because, according to Peter Berger, a great sociologist,
3278080	3287520	these are the characteristics of bureaucracy. I'll let you read them. And there'd be a loss
3287520	3293200	of the sense of uniqueness, just categories. On those things, you had to fill out which box.
3293200	3298320	There's never a box for me. But wait a minute, with whom, on which day, in what circumstances,
3299200	3306480	and in what mood, quantity would become the only criteria, not quality. There'd be a sort of either
3306480	3311200	ornus. No, you can't have, well, it might be this, it might be that. You've got to go, yes,
3311200	3318400	it's this or yes, it's that. Reasonableness would be replaced by pure raciocination,
3318400	3322640	which is not the same thing. In German, there's a distinction, as you know, the German speakers
3322640	3328240	here between Vernunft and Frischland. And we don't have this distinction in English. So I make the
3328240	3333600	distinction between reason, which is an embodied thing that comes with experience and being able
3333600	3340240	to think clearly, whereas rationalization is just the application of logical rules.
3340240	3344640	There'd be a failure of what we call common sense, and there's now extremely uncommon.
3345360	3350480	There'd be systems designed simply to maximize utility, loss of social cohesion,
3350480	3356000	depersonalization, paranoia and lack of trust, because the left hemisphere wants to control.
3356000	3361120	Its only power is control. So if it thinks things are slipping out of control, it's starting,
3361120	3366400	how can I control them better? We need more cameras. We need perhaps a database. Yes,
3366400	3371680	let's have a database of the genomes of the population. There'd be a need, in other words,
3371680	3378400	for total control and anger and aggression would be the term of our conversations.
3378400	3383360	People think the bad old days used to say, oh, the left hemisphere is down to earth,
3383360	3389440	reliable, but not emotional. Whereas the right hemisphere is a bit given to moods,
3389440	3394640	you know, that's terrible. But actually, the emotion that most strongly lateralizes,
3394640	3399520	of all emotions, is anger, and it lateralizes to the left hemisphere, not to the right.
3402080	3406560	And we would, you remember how when something doesn't work, oh, it's nothing to do with me,
3406560	3411760	I can't be responsible, remember that? Well, we would be the passive victims of other people's
3411760	3419680	doings, never a problem with us. And in this world, art would become pretty conceptual. It would have
3421840	3427200	Latin, a sense of depth and bizarre perspectives. These are things that only the right hemisphere
3427200	3432240	can fully understand, and therefore came into being three times in Greece, in Rome. It wasn't
3432240	3439760	just invented in Florence in 1453. It was invented serially, and then lost the civilization decayed,
3439760	3444640	because it's how the right hemisphere sees depth in the world, not just the screen in front of it.
3445520	3449600	Music would reduce a little more than rhythm, because that's the only bit the left hemisphere
3449600	3455760	gets. The complexities of melody and harmony are interpreted by the right hemisphere, that is
3455760	3460240	the distinction in professional musicians who train their brains especially, but that's the norm.
3461200	3466720	And language would become, I hope not too much like mine, diffuse, excessive, lacking in concrete
3466720	3471920	reference. There'd be a deliberate undercutting of the sense of awe or wonder, because what does
3471920	3476320	that mean? It just means you haven't done enough research yet. Of course, we understand everything.
3476320	3481360	One more experiment, and we really have got it, that actually to be fully present in the world and
3481360	3487360	to understand it, and to be appreciative of it with gratitude, which is the secret of a fulfilling
3487360	3494640	and happy life, we need to be able to rediscover the sense of awe or wonder. And flow would just
3494640	3500800	become an infinite series of pieces like a goods train. There'd be discarding of all tacit forms
3500800	3506240	of knowing, everything having to be explicit, network of small complicated rules strangling us.
3506240	3514960	This is what the top fill saw in America in 1837. That was a very prescient man. And we would be like
3516400	3521840	Descartes proudly calling ourselves spectators rather than actors in the world sitting on the
3521840	3528800	sofa with a six-pack, watching it all go by on the telly. And all this would be accompanied by
3528800	3534160	a dangerously unwarranted optimism. Well, thank goodness we don't live in that world.
3538160	3547440	So this is my last words, values. Shaila created this pyramid of values. And I say these are the
3547440	3553040	only ones that we now respect, the values of utility and pleasure. All the other ones, what
3553040	3562880	he meant by Laban's verta was courage, magnanimity, fidelity, generosity. All of that seems to be the
3562880	3567920	sort of thing that nowadays only suckers do that. And other people profit from it. So why would you
3567920	3573520	do that? Why don't it just be a dog with each dog? Values of the intellect, geistig verta, of course
3573520	3578880	you know that geist means both mind and soul. These would be things like beauty, goodness and
3578880	3584720	truth, the platonic virtues. And at the top is das Heilige, the holy. And I believe we have inverted
3584720	3590320	this. So in our left hemisphere world, the holy is just a fiction that enables certain priests to
3590320	3596080	have power. The values of the intellect are really just to do with sexual selection. The values of
3596080	3601600	vitality, as I say, are those espoused by people who don't know any better. And thank God they do
3601600	3606000	because we can take advantage of them. And really it's all in the service of use and pleasure.
3606000	3613200	Well, we live in an upside down world, my friends. This is where we are now. We've lost value. We
3613200	3620080	have a lust for the power to manipulate, which is the left emitter's raison d'etre. We seem to have
3620080	3625520	lost any sense of purpose, because we think of purpose in the utilitarian way. The purpose of the
3626480	3629440	of the copy of the copying machine is to
3631840	3641520	purpose the copying machine and whereas we have a purpose, even when it's not a utilitarian
3641520	3648320	purpose. And lastly, there's a blaring of boundaries between truth and falsehood now.
3649280	3655440	There's a war on truth, basically, all around us, from politicians and from various sectors
3655440	3663840	of society, which is that of bureaucracy and AI, turning everything that is living into
3663840	3669760	a series of processes. And I can talk, as you can well imagine, for a very great
3669760	3682880	deal of time about those and have done on other occasions that I'm not going to do now. Thank you.
