Checking COST DKG/Ilaria Tiddi： ＂Explainability with Knowledge Graphs： what have we learnt？＂ (COST DKG Talk Series).txt
 In the conversation, the topic of multimodal knowledge graphs was brought up, highlighting the integration of both abstract concepts and physical world data. This raises interesting possibilities for generating explanations that incorporate multiple types of data, such as image labels or other modalities. The approach developed by the speaker, which was based on dereferencing links in a traditional web crawling fashion, could potentially be applied to multimodal data points as well.

The speaker's subsequent methods after moving away from dereferencing have primarily focused on a global view for generating embeddings, which can encode a lot of information in a compact form. This approach is flexible and could work in distributed and decentralized settings, as long as there are connections or pointers between data points. The challenge lies in identifying relevant links and filtering out irrelevant information, regardless of whether the data is centralized or decentralized.

The speaker emphasized that the main concern was not about storing the graph but rather about managing the vast amount of information and determining which connections are meaningful. This aspect remains valid in any context, whether dealing with a web of data or other forms of stored information.

The speaker thanked the audience for their questions and engagement during the talk and the previous TNA session. The next event was announced for January 31st at the same time, and attendees were encouraged to check out the CODE-X project's website, follow them on social media (formerly known as Twitter), and find recordings of all the talks, including this one, on their YouTube channel.
