00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Hey everyone, welcome to this reading of my essay, Masculinity and Nothingness.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,480
So since the topic of masculinity has been on the news with the rise of controversial

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,520
figures like Andrew Tay, I decided to write this essay on masculinity from an existentialist

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,000
perspective, particularly inspired by the work of John Posatra and Martin Heidegger.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,200
So without further ado, let's get started, Masculinity and Nothingness.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,320
Do you become a man instead of being born one?

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,120
Because we have, for millennia, made moral, aesthetic, religious demands on the world,

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,880
looked upon it with blind desire, passion or fear, and abandoned ourselves to the bad

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,280
habits of illogical thinking.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,440
This world has gradually become so marvelously variegated, frightful, meaningful, soulful.

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,800
It is a quiet color, but we have been the colorists, favorite nature, human or too human.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,400
You are condemned to be a man, not because we live amidst a so-called masculinity crisis

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,040
where young men are purposeless and lost.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,880
These are secondary concerns.

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,440
Instead it's because you're thrown into this world with circumstances you never chose.

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,840
You're born into a specific time, family, culture, gender and body that you never asked

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
for.

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,080
You have no idea why you are here, but still expected to follow arbitrary customs, social

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,120
conventions, with ties of kinship, duty and so on.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:42,200
As the song Riders on the Storm goes, into this world we are thrown like a dog without

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,520
a bone.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,720
If you momentarily pause and think of the uncanny nature of existence and your position

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:56,480
in an ostensibly meaningless universe where you nevertheless seek meaning, you discover

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,640
life is downright absurd.

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,160
Accordingly grasping this absurdity is a starting point to realizing that masculinity, as defined

26
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,400
by society, does not exist.

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:17,440
Therefore what Simone de Beauvoir said about women also applies to men albeit differently.

28
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,240
One is not born but rather becomes a woman, a second sex.

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,520
Respective of your biological sex, what you think of as a real man that is how you should

30
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,760
conduct yourself both socially and privately is a sociohistorical construct where you become

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,920
a man instead of being born one.

32
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,480
Since man lacks any masculine essence, you are free.

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,600
And man's freedom amongst his throneness is the actual crisis.

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,640
To understand throneness, a concept introduced by Martin Heidegger as Guofenheim, lets exemplify

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,600
using the body which inescapably constitutes one's being.

36
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,000
As Jean-Paul Sartre argued, you are a transcendent consciousness that allows you to transcend

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,880
a subjective body and experience freedom, a tearing away from oneself, a rashmaswa.

38
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,200
So perhaps you've had the bizarre experience one goes through in life, apropos one's body.

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,920
You may stand naked in front of a mirror and see that you, whatever you or I mean, Heidegger

40
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,360
calls it a Dasein, Dasein, their being.

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,120
Dasein's being is always at issue for it and its very being as having to take a stand

42
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,920
upon that issue by living its life in one way or another.

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,480
The Cambridge Heidegger lexicon.

44
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:51,000
Have a body that seems alien, which you may not even like and yet you as a self cannot

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,840
be in this world without it.

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,080
In fact, it's impossible to imagine what it's like to live without a body.

47
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,600
For a moment, leave aside the vain attributes, e.g. fatness, scrawniness, stretch marks,

48
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:12,160
pimples, etc. and look at your body phenomenologically as part of things themselves, meaning back

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,160
to the ways that things of the world are actually given an experience.

50
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,480
Then you realize, as elucidated by Maurice Molopointe, the body is something that's

51
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,920
a factical part of you.

52
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,840
It's endowed to you automatically as a brute fact of your existence.

53
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,040
Although at first glance your body looks like any other object in the world, if you keep

54
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,480
staring at that mirror, you'll realize this body of yours isn't merely a set of properties

55
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,200
and mechanisms, rather it's what allows you to exist.

56
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,080
In fact, when you act in the world by going for a walk, let's say, and duck a protruding

57
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,240
tree branch, you never experience the body as a thing utilized to duck that branch.

58
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,160
Instead, as you're engaged in the act, the body disappears, and your intentionality,

59
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,440
not to let that branch touch you, constitutes your experience.

60
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,400
Paradoxically, the disappearance of the body is what allows your intent to actualize.

61
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,240
The body also allows you to make sense of the world and how the broader ecological context

62
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,480
you're immersed within is structured.

63
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,720
Like in our example, that of an unpredictable environment where tree branches are jutting

64
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,360
out.

65
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,440
One ought to realize that the body isn't a mere vessel to carry our conscious experience

66
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,160
around the world, but rather it's a part of us innately.

67
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,680
Of course, such a prosaic experience doesn't necessarily lead to the aforementioned incongruity

68
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,800
of the body-feeling alien, as your body seems to be doing what it's supposed to do by following

69
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,440
your commands, so to speak.

70
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,960
Nonetheless, it's indicative of how you're thrown into your body, and that it isn't something

71
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,200
you can dispose of by uploading your consciousness to a computer or some such nonsense.

72
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,960
However, something saliently particular to the body you'll see on that mirror is your

73
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,560
penis, the phallic, fleshy, hairy bulge between your legs that St. Augustine says God gave

74
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,560
us as punishment for original sin, because as most men know, it doesn't work when you

75
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,000
want it to, think of a one-night stand, and works when you don't want it to, think of

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,960
a random erection in public.

77
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,360
Your penis is the quintessential indicator of the bizarreness of life, as it shows the

78
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,680
antagonism between your freedom as a conscious and transcendent human being, while also having

79
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:54,040
your existence physically embodied with biological drives such as an unfitted libido, in our case.

80
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,960
When wanting to duck that branch, your body follows your intentionality, but rarely does

81
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,440
a man control his sexual drives, or lack thereof.

82
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,880
As Haruki Murakami writes, the penis is a strange organ that has a mind of its own and

83
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,000
thinks thoughts not shared by my brain, Kafka on the show, and Augustine knows this best

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,600
because he really couldn't keep it in his pants back in the 4th century.

85
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,640
So your penis is illustrative of the real masculinity crisis, because it shows the paradox of existence.

86
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,880
Considering that, unlike objects, e.g. trees, chairs, iPhones, etc., that are being in the

87
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,440
world, onsua, a mode of existence that is static, unconscious, and simply is, you are

88
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:49,360
infinite freedom, a being for itself, posua, that is a conscious being aware of their own

89
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,840
consciousness, but is also incomplete, ambiguous, and non-determined.

90
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,280
This lacking of a predetermined essence forces man to create himself out of nothingness,

91
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,760
and man is nothing when the nothingness is primarily realized to us through negation,

92
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,480
that is, when a person's absence is accurately apprehended.

93
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,720
The most vivid example he, Sartre, provides to illustrate this pre-reflective negation

94
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,160
as the apprehension of Peir's absence from a café.

95
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,640
Sartre describes Peir's absence as pervading the whole café.

96
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,920
The café is cast in the metaphorical shade of Peir, not being there at the time he had

97
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,560
been expected.

98
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,680
This experience depends on human expectations, of course.

99
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,720
Sartre argues that if, by contrast, we imagine or reflect that someone else is not present,

100
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,920
say the Duke of Wellington, an elephant, etc., these abstract negative facts are not existentially

101
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,840
given in the same manner as our pre-reflective encounter with Peir's absence.

102
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,800
They're not given as an objective fact, as a component of the real.

103
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,960
Inomenologically speaking, the nothingness of Peir is a reality.

104
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,040
In your experience, his palpable lack is salient about everything else, in this hypothetical

105
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
café.

106
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,800
Therefore, it gives non-being an ontological place.

107
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,160
Everything that's already at being in the café, from the other patrons, baristas, waiters,

108
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:29,120
the furniture, etc., ceases to exist and your attention goes solely to the absence of Peir.

109
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,880
This pre-reflective negative apprehension penetrates you, but you don't directly intend

110
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,680
not to see Peir, but rather you dramatically encounter the non-being of Peir, or as Sartre

111
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,920
writes, Peir absent haunts this café, being a nothingness.

112
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,200
In that sense, the fact of your pre-reflective negation, apropos Peir, also applies to you

113
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,160
because let's say if Peir showed up and you were absent, then he would encounter your

114
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,920
non-being because you're a Dazain, much like him.

115
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,520
So what makes your being stand out is not any grounded positive affirmation, i.e. reputation,

116
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,200
personality, psychological type, and so on, but everything you're not.

117
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,920
The ambiguity of your existence, you are what you are, and you're not what you are, is the

118
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Sartre and nothingness.

119
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,680
It imbues the tension between your being in itself and being for itself.

120
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,320
That is between you being a biological, psychological, and socio-historical creature, and your self-perception

121
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:41,800
as negating those observable or descriptive properties of your being in support of an aspirational

122
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,480
or ideal view of yourself that's learning, growing, philosophizing, etc.

123
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:54,240
In that vein, your starting point to being you is by declaring I am not that thing, which

124
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,680
perhaps is why your starting point to being a man is by declaring I reject masculinity.

125
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,120
For that reason, your nothingness condemns you to be free, because if you're nothing,

126
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,040
you only exist in this world qua infinite possibilities, presenting themselves to you.

127
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,800
Similar to standing on the edge of a cliff and knowing very well you have the freedom

128
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,720
to jump, nonetheless, you must choose from these possibilities every conscious moment

129
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,920
of your life.

130
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,640
Therefore, you're constantly recreating yourself through action by projecting yourself

131
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,800
onto the world, which is a task that leaves one perturbed.

132
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,880
Fegregarde describes as angst as the dizziness of freedom.

133
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,760
Your masculinity has no essential reality.

134
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,040
It doesn't objectively exist, and the existence of a man precedes the essence of his masculinity.

135
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:52,280
That said, your body, particularly the penis, is still a reminder that while you're completely

136
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:58,440
aware of your freedom, you nonetheless throne into a life of finitude that constrains this

137
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,600
freedom of your consciousness.

138
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,440
Though you're not trapped in it, thinking so is a piezolanumist response to life.

139
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,800
As Portillic writes, man is essentially finite freedom.

140
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,400
Freedom not in the sense of indeterminacy, but in the sense of being able to determine

141
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,560
himself through decision in the center of his being.

142
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,600
Man as finite freedom is free within the contingencies of his finitude, the courage to be.

143
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,320
The contradiction between freedom and throneness is irreconcilable.

144
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,240
Nor is it a mere duality one can be indifferent towards, but a fact of life to struggle with,

145
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,680
violently.

146
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:46,240
No synthesis between these conflicting truths lead to sublimated wholeness, or some higher

147
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,960
comforting truth.

148
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:54,680
Instead, the truth lies in the sheer antagonism itself, and it's this violent friction that

149
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:02,800
leads to what Gabriel Marcel calls the homoverto, the traveler, where man is never a destination,

150
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,360
but he is an unresolved contradictory and itenderant being.

151
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,320
We can never own anything, and we never truly settle anywhere, even if we stay in one place

152
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,840
all our lives, at the existentialist café.

153
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,400
Being thrown into the aforementioned paradox puts us in the unknown, and sometimes even

154
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
the uncanny.

155
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,760
Or specifically, for Marcel it leads to the mystery of existence.

156
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,880
One will never make sense of this mystery, yet it ought to be faced valiantly.

157
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,040
It isn't a mere speculative problem that's solvable a-personally at a distance, but it

158
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,640
becomes a mystery only because, above all, we are involved in the mystery as it's particular

159
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,880
to us and cannot be tackled by anybody at all, but rather it reveals itself for nobody

160
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,160
but me.

161
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,120
Facing everything delineated above requires courage, which a man should aspire to embody.

162
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,840
Paul Tillich writes on courage pertaining to anxiety stating, courage does not remove

163
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,240
anxiety.

164
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,880
Since anxiety is existential, it cannot be removed.

165
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,160
But courage takes the anxiety of non-being into itself.

166
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Courage is self-affirmation, in spite of, namely, in spite of non-being.

167
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,480
He who acts courageously takes in his self-affirmation the anxiety of non-being upon himself, the

168
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,400
courage to be.

169
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Similarly, your courage shouldn't remove the paradox and mystery of existence, but

170
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:47,320
take an opponent yourself assumed fully, and then you act in spite of and through it with

171
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,840
the awareness that only you can affirm yourself, only you can act in this particular instance.

172
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,360
Therefore, to do away with preconceived notions of masculinity is this supreme act of courage

173
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,600
for a man.

174
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,200
If you haven't experienced any of this phenomena illuminated above, you're distracting yourself

175
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,600
and being a coward.

176
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,480
If you're listening to misogynists like Andrew Tate, so-called men's podcasts like Fresh

177
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,680
and Fit, or even more positive figures like Jordan Peterson, you have no existential vitality,

178
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,680
no awareness of life, and your will to live is weakened.

179
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,680
Thereby, you refuse to take responsibility to face reality and have outsourced your living

180
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
to the other.

181
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,960
You have become a sheep refusing to think critically, you are a slave that needs a master

182
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,280
commanding you how to live.

183
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:47,680
Sathra calls such instances bad faith, mv svoa, denying our inherent freedom.

184
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,520
We know we're radically free, but we repudiate the responsibility of their freedom by conforming

185
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,840
to the other.

186
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:01,080
In our case, that's masculinity, or what a real man should be, similar to how a Parisian

187
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,600
waiter plays a performative role.

188
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,800
Let us consider this waiter in the café.

189
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,520
His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid.

190
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,880
He comes towards the patrons with a step, a little too quick.

191
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,360
He bends forward a little too eagerly.

192
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,680
His voice, his eyes express an interest, a little too solicitous for the order of the

193
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,840
customer.

194
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,400
All his behavior seems to us a gain.

195
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,200
He applies himself to training his movements as if they were mechanisms, the one regulating

196
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
the other.

197
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,280
His gestures and even his voice seem to be mechanisms.

198
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,600
He gives himself the quickness and pettiless rapidity of things.

199
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,720
He is plain.

200
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,560
He is amusing himself.

201
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,760
But what is he playing?

202
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,440
We need not watch long before we can explain it.

203
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,000
He is playing at being a waiter in a café.

204
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,160
There are indeed many precautions to impress a man in what he is, as if we lived in perpetual

205
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,760
fear, that he might escape from it, that he might break away and suddenly elude his condition,

206
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
being a nothingness.

207
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,320
This is no different to the performative role a businessman trying to sell you financial

208
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,160
freedom plays.

209
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,560
He speaks and dresses a certain way and asks questions not to understand or engage in dialogue,

210
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,360
but to sustain his performance of being a competent and astute person.

211
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,000
Much like the waiter, every action by the businessman is contrived.

212
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,640
He follows a prefabricated narrative given to him by society.

213
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,080
He is an actor following a script, performing for the public.

214
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,160
Of course, being a man is also a performance you put on.

215
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,120
That said, bad faith isn't about lies, self-deception or inauthenticity.

216
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,800
As intimated in this essay, you don't have an authentic self.

217
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,600
So there's no use trying to be your true self.

218
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,520
And concomitantly, you cannot deceive a self that doesn't exist.

219
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:11,640
Satra also doesn't believe one can escape bad faith entirely, because it's omnipresent.

220
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,920
And we all inescapably play a role, as Shakespeare writes, all the worlds a stage, and all men

221
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,320
and women merely players, as you like it.

222
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,000
Does this mean you're in a hopeless situation where you'll always be a puppet of society?

223
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes.

224
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,320
And given you're free, in typical Camusian fashion, you can still choose to embrace the

225
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:41,080
absurdity of your existence and find courage in hopelessness.

226
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,360
While you will succumb to bad faith, you can fight your cowardly demise for eternity.

227
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,560
You can orient yourself towards courage, taking radical responsibility and refusing to take

228
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,640
comfort in false masculinity.

229
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,960
You can create your subjective ideal of what being a man entails that solely appeases you

230
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
alone.

231
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,760
Indeed, it's unsurprising that Satra ends his magnum opus by writing, Man is a useless

232
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,840
passion, being a nothingness.

233
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,320
But perhaps his life showed that he tried to make himself worthy of his condition, and

234
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
so should you.

235
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,680
But on your own account, after all, Satra is just another dead philosopher.

236
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,080
Whatever the case may be, this is the reality you're born into, so do with it as you may.

237
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,120
Frankly, I choose courage, because all the ideals expounded by the phenomenologists and

238
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,160
existentialists I tackled in this essay make life the ultimate adventure worth living for,

239
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,680
if one doesn't shy away from them.

240
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,360
Coda.

241
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,760
The themes of exploding this essay certainly aren't specific to men.

242
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,680
If you're human, they apply to you, bar none.

243
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,560
However, I've intentionally used a language that'll direct this essay towards men, who

244
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,200
are told they're in a crisis in the current socio-cultural and historical position.

245
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,720
Therefore, this crisis ought to be aptly named the human crisis instead of the masculine

246
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,880
adjective, although that would generalize the situation all too much, making it an abstract

247
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,000
theory which the existentialists would detest.

248
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,400
In any case, replacing the terms man and masculine with woman and feminine, respectively, wouldn't

249
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,880
change the underlying message of this piece.
