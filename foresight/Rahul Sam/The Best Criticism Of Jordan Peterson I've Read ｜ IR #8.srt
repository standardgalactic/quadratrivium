00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the Interrelant Podcast.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:12,440
I've got to say, I'm in a really good mood today because I just sat for the AWS developer

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,900
associate examination and passed it.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,900
So I'm feeling good.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,740
It's always a good feeling to, you know, work towards something and then kind of achieve

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,180
it and well, I guess now what?

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,580
Back to the meaninglessness of life.

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,520
In any case, this is kind of an interesting episode because the previous episode I did

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,860
a few weeks ago was my first ever book review.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:47,580
And I think this is going to be the first ever article, article or let's say essay commentary.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:54,980
And it's going to be on the piece that David Dunyong, I really hope I pronounce your surname

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,980
right.

13
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,980
David, apologies.

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,540
I mean, no disrespect.

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:05,260
It's going to be on the polemical piece that David wrote on Jordan Peterson.

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:12,500
And frankly, from everything I've read on Jordan Peterson, you know, I think today this

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:20,100
is the best criticism I've read of him in a very deep sense, not in like a superficial,

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,220
you know, I don't know, the kind of the what like corporate media does, sort of dismissive

19
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,740
calling him a French far right, whatever.

20
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:37,340
But I really thought David's criticism was very apt to the current situation, but also

21
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,340
just philosophical.

22
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,620
It was quite deep and he made a lot of sense.

23
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,620
And he's a great writer.

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,180
I only hope to write like David one day.

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:54,740
Now I've got to say, of course, as I said, this piece is a polemic and like myself, unlike

26
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:04,140
myself, David is very, very critical of Peterson and doesn't like him at all.

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,460
I personally do like Jordan Peterson quite a lot.

28
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,820
I've been influenced by him, especially I'd say when I was about 20, 21, this is like

29
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:20,380
around 2016, I started watching his lectures early on and I really enjoyed his lectures.

30
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:28,300
I still very much enjoy the lectures he did on psychologists, like for example, I think

31
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,740
my best learning on John P.J. was through Jordan Peterson.

32
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,940
I'd even say Jordan Peterson was the person who introduced me to Heidegger a couple of

33
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,260
years ago, even though, you know, Peterson doesn't really go into Heidegger's philosophy

34
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,140
kind of, he lectures on him through like a psychological lens.

35
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,860
In any case, the point that I make is that I really like Jordan Peterson.

36
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,620
And that's exactly the reason I think it's important for me to make this episode and

37
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,980
record this and I'm now getting to more as to why that is later on.

38
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,340
So firstly, I want to put a quick caveat as I tend to do with these episodes.

39
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:20,220
I will truly try and keep away from the day-to-day politics or contemporary issues Peterson gets

40
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,940
himself involved in.

41
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,300
He tends to do that from time to time.

42
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,660
I think he kind of likes it.

43
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,140
Let's be honest, he likes the attention, you know, I mean, I love the doc, but he loves

44
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:37,700
the attention he gets, but rather in David's paper, I'm going to focus on the philosophical

45
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,700
critiques.

46
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,380
Oh, I didn't mention this.

47
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,780
By the way, how I came across this was actually through David's YouTube channel, Theory and

48
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:52,980
Philosophy, which I'd say now at this point in my life is my greatest source of learning

49
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:00,620
when it comes to philosophy and theory, especially being a software engineer, having no background

50
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,940
in arts or the humanities.

51
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,260
I studied computer science.

52
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,300
I didn't even know how to study or learn about all these different theories and philosophies

53
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:18,540
because I never had any proper formal academic training, even though I deeply love the humanities.

54
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,940
I really appreciate it.

55
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
It means a lot to me.

56
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,460
I spend so much of my time trying to understand it and, you know, read philosophy and literature

57
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,140
and all of that.

58
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,660
So I'd say this point in my life without a question, man, David's YouTube channel is

59
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,420
one of my greatest sources of learning.

60
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,420
It's a great resource, really, to go through, virtually any book, I'll go through some of

61
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,980
the stuff he did later on.

62
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,940
Recently I went through his Kant, a critic of pure recent series.

63
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,740
My favorite banan was the one he did on Hannah Arendt.

64
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,060
My God, such a good series, David, really, you just have an amazing ability, you're so

65
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,060
eloquent.

66
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,580
Also, I like that you speak with no pretension, which I appreciate as a layperson or as a

67
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,580
neophyte.

68
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,660
So, sorry, I'm kind of all over the place, but in the preamble, I want to say, as I said,

69
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,700
I try to stick to more of the philosophical critiques, more of the ideological critiques

70
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:27,780
and not get too enravelled in the kind of day-to-day fleeting politics, let's say.

71
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,060
And, of course, as I said, I'm a big fan of Peterson.

72
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:40,940
I also like some of the figures in the Intellectual Dark Web, and that begs the question, why should

73
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:49,220
we be skeptical and question these public intellectuals, people like Sam Harris, Jordan

74
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:56,820
Peterson, Brett Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, oh God, Harvey Weinstein.

75
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,220
That's funny, what's Brett's brother's name, Eric Weinstein, we should definitely question

76
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,220
Harvey Weinstein.

77
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,420
Ah, right, that was, that was, I swear, that was an intentional, that was just a mistake.

78
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:14,460
In any case, all these people in the Intellectual Dark Web, why we should question them, and

79
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:21,220
I think the reason is because, firstly, whenever, personally, whenever I feel that the narratives

80
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:29,260
that people give out to the world, or the philosophies people propagate and advocate

81
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,820
for, let's say, when they're too coherent, when they're too, let's say, when they're

82
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,300
too much of like a salvation, when they're too redemptive, or when they're too, this

83
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,780
is it, we've got the absolute philosophy, we've got the absolute ideology to make something

84
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,940
work, I generally take a step back and I become a bit skeptical, because for me, you know,

85
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,820
in many ways I'm an absurdist, so there really isn't the kind of coherence that a lot of

86
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,140
the people in the Intellectual Dark Web would like to portray.

87
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,220
And it's actually a point David gets to in his article, which is what I really liked.

88
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:13,540
So I think whenever we feel like we're getting easy, easy answers, easy solutions, or not

89
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:22,500
even easy really, but the kind of solutions that seem straightforward without any deeper

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,220
introspection and deeper inspection into it, I think we should be skeptical of those kind

91
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,220
of solutions.

92
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:39,100
And I would say, speaking personally, around two or three years ago, when I really started

93
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,900
to like Jordan Peterson, I realized that I was liking him a bit too much, almost to

94
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,380
the level of obsequiousness.

95
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:53,380
And that was definitely unhealthy, because I realized, wow, I can't even read an honest

96
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,540
criticism of his work without taking it personally, as if he's some of my personal savior or

97
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,540
whatever.

98
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:07,140
And, and that's when I truly wanted to only again, treat Jordan Peterson as a person who

99
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:13,700
influences me, but not as the only point of influence or like this kind of he's in Christ

100
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,860
to put it in a dramatic way.

101
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,300
And that's when I started questioning him a bit more and looking for points of view that

102
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:28,260
differ from him points of view that, you know, he's completely a versatile, let's say, and

103
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:35,020
I realized, oh, wow, I actually completely disagree or predominantly with most of his

104
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,020
points.

105
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:42,620
I disagree with his politics and even his underlying philosophy, despite, and his interesting thing,

106
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:49,860
despite truly starting to admire and like him as a person, as an individual, as a teacher

107
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,860
and as a psychologist, like I still find his work on psychology to be brilliant.

108
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:04,420
I think he's a great psychologist, even though I think he's got his politics and his philosophy

109
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,500
and I see a lot of loopholes with his worldview.

110
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,580
And as a person, you know, I've got to say, again, one, one never, one never knows, especially

111
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,780
with public figures, how they portray themselves in public, you know, that kind of distinction

112
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,620
between the private life and the person, between the personal life and the public life.

113
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,340
Peterson looks like a genuine person to me.

114
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:32,620
He looks sincere and I'm, you know, speaking purely personally, I'm the kind of person

115
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:39,700
that appreciates family and having a good relationship with your significant other,

116
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:46,460
your wife, your spouse, whatever, your children, and I find that he's got that kind of relationship

117
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,900
and it seems just that that true love of a family and I appreciate anyone who can foster

118
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:59,300
that and who can have that in life because that certainly takes work.

119
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:06,620
So yeah, those are the points of the preamble and that, of course, leads me to this point

120
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,460
and I wasn't even going to put this part in the episode, but I realized that actually

121
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,780
maybe it's something I should talk about before I get to the article itself.

122
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,900
I still don't know if David Steeleman or Strowman, Peterson's arguments.

123
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,940
I don't know if he mischaracterized him and whether he, how he portrayed Peterson's

124
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:33,940
oppositions to Bill C-16, got to keep in mind David too is a philosophy student.

125
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,220
I think he's doing a PhD in philosophy.

126
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,580
Anyway, he's an art student.

127
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,900
So, you know, I don't want to make an argument from authority, but I do think someone who's

128
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:51,660
taken the time to go and study theory and go and study philosophy in academia.

129
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,300
I sell whole academia in high regard, contrary to most people on the internet.

130
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,740
And I would say a person like that probably has a better understanding of some of the

131
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:08,940
intricacies of these debates when it comes to free speech, pronouns, all the different

132
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,820
fragments that are connected in the whole Bill C-16 controversy.

133
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,940
So I didn't get the impression that David was trying to mischaracterize Peterson, but

134
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:26,700
also that's the one reason for that is because sometimes Peterson himself isn't coherent

135
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,380
with what his arguments are in his opposition to Bill C-16.

136
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:37,540
He will say it's a purely free speech issue, but then you can see from some of the interviews,

137
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,700
which is the interview that I'm going to play right now, that it's no, no, it's not just

138
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
a free speech issue.

139
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,140
He's got an issue with the gender identification too.

140
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:52,660
So without me putting words in his mouth, let's listen to this short clip that I found

141
00:11:52,660 --> 00:12:01,580
on Majid Nawaz's show where, I mean, this was in 2018, so a bit after the whole controversy

142
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,580
broke out.

143
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,260
And I think this is the most, this is the shortest clip I could find where Peterson lays

144
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:15,180
down his points, kind of enumerates all his points as to why he opposes Bill C-16.

145
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,500
So let's take a look.

146
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,700
Bill C-16 purported to do nothing but extend human rights provisions to an excluded group,

147
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,220
let's say, to the transgender and non-gender binary types.

148
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,700
And that was the federal legislation.

149
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:36,540
It also made it a hate crime to discriminate or harass, essentially.

150
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,460
So now then the question is, well, what exactly do you mean by discriminate or harass?

151
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,580
And why exactly is that a hate crime under the criminal code?

152
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,740
Well, there was an answer to that.

153
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,420
The answer was, well, this bill will be interpreted in light of the policies generated by the

154
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,540
Ontario Human Rights Commission, very large set of policies.

155
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,180
Now the Ontario Human Rights Commission is a radically leftist organization.

156
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,940
I think it's the most dangerous organization in Canada, although you could debate that.

157
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,460
Of course, I've got to make a comment.

158
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,180
So I'm going to make comments in the middle of what he's saying.

159
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,820
I mean, if you want to watch the whole thing without me interrupting, just go and watch

160
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
the original video.

161
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,020
But you see, this is another thing what Peter said, as much as I like him, you know, when

162
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,420
he makes a statement, such a blatant statement that the Ontario Human Rights Commission is

163
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,380
the most dangerous organization in all of Canada.

164
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:35,060
That's where, you know, touching on my earlier point, one should take a step back and, oh,

165
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
is it really?

166
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,660
Like, what does he mean by that?

167
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:44,540
The most dangerous, that's quite a leap to call an organization the most dangerous organization

168
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,820
in all of Canada.

169
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,420
This is where I think we should pause the video because it's normally on YouTube that

170
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,940
he's popular and actually think and not let him, when I mean him, I mean, Peterson or

171
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,260
anyone for that matter do the thinking for us.

172
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,100
So back to the video.

173
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,460
Debate that and they said all sorts of policies about how this legislation was going to be

174
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:13,540
interpreted and the federal government linked to their website to state that Bill C16 would

175
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,580
be interpreted in light of those guidelines.

176
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,540
So I went and read all the policies.

177
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,860
Well one of the policies was that if you didn't use the preferred pronouns of a given group

178
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,620
that you could be charged essentially with a hate crime.

179
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,620
And I thought, no.

180
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,620
Which given group is that?

181
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,780
You mean talking about transgender people?

182
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,780
Yeah.

183
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,100
And so there's all these pronouns that have come up.

184
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,420
There's 70 different sets of pronouns approximately to hypothetically describe people who don't

185
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,740
fit anywhere on the gender spectrum, which is also something that I don't really understand.

186
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,740
I don't understand that conceptually.

187
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,240
We'll come to that.

188
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,340
But I just want to hear the story of this bill first.

189
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,340
Well, okay.

190
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:53,300
So now a person is compelled under Canadian law to use the pronoun of another individual's

191
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,900
choice by on pain of law.

192
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,420
And I thought, well no, that's not acceptable.

193
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,540
It's one thing to put limits on what a person can't say, like say with hate speech laws,

194
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,500
which I also don't agree with by the way.

195
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,980
But that's a different argument.

196
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,060
I think it's a narrower argument.

197
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:14,300
But to compel me to use a certain content when I'm formulating my thoughts or my actions

198
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,060
under threat of legislative action, I thought, no, what's happened there is the government

199
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,580
has introduced compelled speech legislation into the private sphere.

200
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,220
It's never happened in the history of English common law.

201
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,340
And so I said, there's no way I'm abiding by that.

202
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,260
I don't care what your damn rationale is.

203
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
We're compassionate.

204
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,500
It's like, no, you're not.

205
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
No, you're not.

206
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,060
You're playing this radical collectivist left wing game.

207
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:41,380
You're trying to gain linguistic supremacy in the area of public discourse.

208
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,980
You're doing that using compassion as a guise and you're pulling the wool over people's

209
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,580
eyes and you're not going to do it with me.

210
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,340
If I was sitting here in front of you as a transgendered male to female or female to

211
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,700
male and we began the conversation at the beginning of the conversation you stumbled

212
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,620
and called me he or she and I was perhaps identifying the other way around.

213
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,660
And then if I'd said to you, please, I'd rather go by she.

214
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,540
How would you respond to that on a personal level?

215
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,460
Well, it would depend on the situation.

216
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,780
But the way I have responded to that because I've had a number of conversations with transgendered

217
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,420
individuals is that I use whatever pronoun seems to go along with the persona that they're

218
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,900
projecting publicly.

219
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,740
It's the simplest thing to do.

220
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,660
Now, if we were if you would respect their choice on an individual level.

221
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:31,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but with a with a with a more contentious pronouns, G insurer and

222
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,860
that sort of thing, that's a whole different issue.

223
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,460
Because the question there is, well, exactly what is it that you're doing when you're

224
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,300
asking me to use those words?

225
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,180
Like are you are you compelling me to play your particular ideological game?

226
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,500
Or is this actually a matter of some personal identity that's important to you?

227
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,340
And those things are not obvious.

228
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,820
And so in a situation like that, the first thing I'd have to do is to try to figure out

229
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,380
just exactly what was going on in the situation and that's not simple.

230
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,500
And so there would be no foregone conclusion that I would address you by the pronouns

231
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
of your choice.

232
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,380
The first thing I'd want to find out is, is that just a narcissistic power play?

233
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,460
Because that's actually the most likely outcome.

234
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,460
I don't know if that's the most likely outcome.

235
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,180
And, you know, Peterson does make a good point.

236
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:20,100
Like, again, there are manipulative, almost psychopathic narcissists in this world who

237
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,540
want to manipulate people and play power games.

238
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,420
So that certainly is the case.

239
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,860
But again, this is, OK, so I've got a few points to make on what Peterson just said.

240
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:40,860
On what Majid Nawaz said about on a personal level, that's an important word he's

241
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,700
personal. I think a lot of this comes down to that.

242
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,180
It comes down to those interpersonal relations and how we treat each other.

243
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,500
We can't bureaucratize it, even though I feel like

244
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:58,900
modern society is trying to, in many ways,

245
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,740
everything is everything is abstracted out into the into the ether, into the bureaucracy,

246
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,420
you know, into like the Kafkaist bureaucracy, and then even things that are so intimate

247
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,100
and so personal, modernity is bureaucratizing it.

248
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,660
And it's kind of unfortunate because a lot of this, which should be dealt at an

249
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:27,660
individual level is trying to be dealt with with laws and policies, which,

250
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,340
frankly, I don't think works.

251
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,140
I don't firstly, it's not authentic.

252
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:36,420
And secondly, this practically, I think it fails.

253
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:41,740
And then on the point Peterson makes about what kind of game you're playing.

254
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,900
So you can clearly see that for him, it's not just a free speech issue,

255
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,940
a gender issue, just play a factor.

256
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,340
And he also is particularly averse to people who are gender fluid or people who are

257
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,940
non-binary, you can see that he doesn't, he doesn't click for him.

258
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,580
He can't comprehend what that means.

259
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,900
And, you know, fair enough, I mean,

260
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,780
to a certain extent, I never really had a problem with the whole gender fluid thing.

261
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,060
I always felt deep down in a very visceral sense that, yeah, gender certainly doesn't

262
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,300
seem something that's binary.

263
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,100
It doesn't seem like something that's fixed.

264
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,740
In fact, I don't think human nature is fixed.

265
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,420
I think human nature is way more dynamic than we think.

266
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,180
It's a lot more deeper than what,

267
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,980
you know, in modernity, the post enlightenment era, we would like to put

268
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,900
everything in comfortable boxes.

269
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,100
It's a human nature is a lot more deeper than that, in my opinion.

270
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,340
And David kind of touches on that in his article, too.

271
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:51,780
But also his thing about, see, this is where, again, I don't know whether

272
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,260
Peterson does a good job and how he articulates his points.

273
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,820
Because it seems a bit vitriolic or it seems a bit hateful the way he

274
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,420
talks about non-binary people.

275
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,260
Again, you know, these are just I'm just touching on my intuitions.

276
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,220
I'm not saying this is exactly what he's saying, not at all.

277
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,740
You know, when he says are non-binary people playing some kind of

278
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,580
narcissistic power player or trying to manipulate other people.

279
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,140
Personally, for my experience,

280
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,460
I've actually I've only really got one non-binary friend, because all of my

281
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,020
other friends are transgender, which means all the other friends in the LGBTQ community,

282
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,260
I mean, which means, you know, they still identify just by the opposite gender,

283
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,620
not the one that was assigned it.

284
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,060
But then, you know, that's that's fine.

285
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,260
And some of them, one of them, actually, I don't even know until she told me.

286
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,820
In any case, the non-binary people, yeah, it is a bit odd.

287
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,740
I'm going to be totally honest, referring someone as they.

288
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,220
But this person that I do know, in no way did I get the impression that this person

289
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,860
was playing some kind of game or this person was trying to manipulate me to,

290
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,020
you know, as Peterson says, is trying to control my linguistic territory.

291
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,660
I didn't get that impression at all.

292
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,740
And if I did, I wouldn't be that person's friend.

293
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,060
I wouldn't associate that person simple as that.

294
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,020
And I think person genuinely didn't feel like a man or a woman or felt non-binary,

295
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,700
whatever that means.

296
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,660
I don't know what that means, because I don't feel like that.

297
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,820
And that's something we've got to learn about.

298
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:32,580
Even he, you know, about life itself, that in some sense, you know,

299
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,820
this is apocryphally attributed to character God.

300
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,380
But, you know, when you label me, you negate me, I think it comes

301
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,620
from this character God's idea that in many ways, that deep

302
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,980
inanness, that subjectivity of being human,

303
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,700
that it can never be quantified.

304
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:56,300
It can never be properly betrayed or abstracted out from the individual.

305
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,500
No one will ever know what it feels like to be me.

306
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,540
Nor will I ever know what it feels like to be some other specific individual,

307
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,060
not an abstract humanity, no, no, no, a specific individual.

308
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,100
And that's for me, you know, my thinking has been heavily influenced

309
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,220
by character God in that way.

310
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,340
And, you know, far enough, Peterson, too, you know, talks a lot about character God.

311
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,660
So saying all that with that long preamble, good Lord, it's 20 minutes already.

312
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,700
And I haven't even got to David's article yet.

313
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,620
Let's discuss David's piece.

314
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,780
The article is titled

315
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,380
Jordan Peterson and the flow of scientific inquiry,

316
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:40,060
a critical evaluation of Peterson's use of science and philosophy

317
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:46,060
in his conquest against social justice by David Gagnon.

318
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,780
Again, I'm so sorry if I got to say

319
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,980
him wrong, David, I truly mean no disrespect.

320
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:56,380
So the article starts off by two quotes by Baudrillard and Nietzsche.

321
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,820
And I also want to say

322
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:04,500
I only knew of Baudrillard as his name in the French intellectual circles.

323
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,580
It's because of David that I've actually truly kind of

324
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,500
delved into his work a bit more and started to understand him.

325
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,780
So again, as I said, David's YouTube channel has had a YouTube channel,

326
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,940
has had what kind of speak?

327
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,180
David's YouTube channel has had a massive influence

328
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,980
on me in the past year or so.

329
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,060
So I'm truly grateful for that, David.

330
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,500
OK, back to the article.

331
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,020
If all enigmas are resolved, the stars go out.

332
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,660
If everything's secret is returned to the visible,

333
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,620
if all illusion is returned to transparent,

334
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,580
then heaven becomes become indifferent to the earth.

335
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,020
Jean Baudrillard, what is the purpose?

336
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,380
And worst still, what is the origin of all science?

337
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:59,420
What is scientific method, perhaps no more than fear

338
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:05,300
of and flight from pessimism, a cycle of defense against truth?

339
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,220
Or to put it in moral terms, is it something like cowardice and insincerity?

340
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,300
To put it immorally, is it a form of cunning?

341
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,060
Oh, Socrates Socrates, was that perhaps your secret?

342
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,580
Oh, mysterious ironies versus perhaps your irony?

343
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,580
Fredric Nietzsche.

344
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,100
David starts off the article saying,

345
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,180
this article argues that Peterson's challenge to postmodern port

346
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,620
as an anti-scientific doctrine is perplexing,

347
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,020
given the general general lack of consensus between his views

348
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,420
and those of the greater scientific community.

349
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,740
The article presents different theoretical frameworks attesting

350
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,100
to the reality of gender non-conforming identities,

351
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,460
as well as to the consequences of denying these identities.

352
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,020
And argues that rather than challenging oppressive systems of governance,

353
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,860
Peterson's project actually mirrors them.

354
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,700
So pretty much the article breaks down

355
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,460
JB's project into three broad conceptual domains.

356
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,380
The three of them are the first one's arguments about postmodernism.

357
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,820
So Peterson's averseness against postmodernism and how he portrays postmodernism.

358
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,740
And of course, the most interesting part, in my opinion, that I had,

359
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,020
I learned a lot from this part, really, the part where David touches

360
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,300
on the scientific discourse, truth and objectivity.

361
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,220
Brilliant, brilliant section of the article.

362
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,340
And the other part is the more of the political part, let's say,

363
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,380
on gender identity.

364
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,140
Now, I'll focus on the latter.

365
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,580
Sorry, I'll focus on the former,

366
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,660
the arguments about postmodernism and the scientific discourse, truth and

367
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,100
objectivity parts over the latter, which is the gender identity part, simply because

368
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,660
for me, I don't know if I'm speaking from a position of privilege here,

369
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,060
but I didn't really care too much about the whole gender identity issue,

370
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,180
because it didn't really personally affect me.

371
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,700
And even in this article, that was the part that I sort of

372
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,660
I did read it a couple of times for this video, but just skimmed over.

373
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,420
It didn't really speak to me in a deeper sense.

374
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,860
But certainly, the poems David make are quite interesting, especially when he

375
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,180
speaks of Judith Butler and Baudrillard.

376
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,020
I'm going to get to that part a bit later,

377
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,180
but I do recommend reading the whole thing, of course, because unlike a book,

378
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,780
this is an article, so you could just read it in one sitting.

379
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,180
David David states,

380
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,500
this article presents counter arguments and evidence that destabilized the

381
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,580
facile deployment of a scientific rationality by Peterson and his allies,

382
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:55,300
and therefore calls into question many of his central claims.

383
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,660
This paper moves through each of these domains

384
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,340
methodically, beginning with his juxtaposition of postmodernism with

385
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:10,180
neo-Marxism, all the while claiming to be a faithful reader to Frederick Nietzsche.

386
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,060
That point there, all the while claiming to be a faithful reader to Frederick

387
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,780
Nietzsche is an important one, because

388
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,580
maybe I'll get to that later on in detail, but

389
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,500
if someone

390
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:29,620
listens to Peterson's lectures and then gets this impression of who Nietzsche is

391
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,900
and then actually reads Nietzsche,

392
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,980
in my opinion, at least, it's a completely different.

393
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,100
So the contradiction is very evident,

394
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,500
because the actual Nietzsche is very much different to the kind of Nietzsche

395
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,260
Peterson portrays, in my opinion.

396
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,740
So that's an important one.

397
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,860
And I thought that was a good point, David, raised in this article.

398
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,740
This is something I started feeling

399
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,540
about two years ago when I actually started reading Nietzsche's work,

400
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,020
especially the gay science

401
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,460
and the anger and evil.

402
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,060
So

403
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,060
anyway, that's an interesting thing to think about.

404
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,100
Of course, I also found there's a problem with

405
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:20,140
Peterson's sort of prima facie associating postmodernism with totalitarianism.

406
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,420
And I think David, again, brings this point to Salience, too.

407
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,500
And furthermore, the kind of the

408
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:33,660
incommensurability between neo-Marxism, which is a metanarrative and postmodernism.

409
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:39,380
You know, David asks, is it true that postmodernism is merely a clever Marxist

410
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:47,140
side of hand seeking like its Marxist predecessor to undermine the West?

411
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,140
Well, again, if you listen to

412
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,300
Peterson, that's the impression you get.

413
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:01,940
But if you do a bit more excavating into, let's say, the over of postmodern

414
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,340
philosophy and literature, which is

415
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,940
virtually an impossible task, because there's so much.

416
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,020
You might get a different impression.

417
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:16,660
But even if you read the, let's say, the well known postmodernist or the kind

418
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,900
of postmodernist Peterson talks about like Derrida and Foucault,

419
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,700
you'd find that, oh, actually, no, you know, it's not easy to just pinpoint them

420
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,860
as Marxist. I mean, Foucault was an anarchist, for God's sake.

421
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,100
And then.

422
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,260
This is again is a good point I've spoken about as before in my previous episodes.

423
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,300
And David certainly puts in a much more

424
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,180
articulate and eloquent manner than I have ever done.

425
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,180
Scientific rationality is fragile and we can't

426
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,540
unequivocally place faith on the science.

427
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,300
I'm pretty in quotes because the science is a very

428
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,660
determined with a lot of baggage, the science.

429
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,940
We can't put this kind of faith of science being universal,

430
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,180
a historical, a cultural.

431
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,740
And most certainly when we take the scientific

432
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,220
constitution, we can't derive social values from it.

433
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,020
That's a good point David makes using Baudrillard.

434
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,580
And I was thinking about this recently.

435
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,540
The intellectual dark web, Peterson, all these, I mean, I know the intellectual

436
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,700
dark web doesn't really exist anymore, but people, you know, from that elk

437
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,060
would agree with this statement, I think, especially with what happened with covid

438
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:40,140
because most of most of them were involved with all these controversies

439
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:46,380
regarding the lockdowns as in the midst of covid, the lockdowns, the vaccinations.

440
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:52,140
And they would agree that science isn't this

441
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,620
entity, let's say, that you could just detach or science isn't this thing that

442
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,660
can just plainly be detached from the rest of society.

443
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,300
And from our, from our, let's say, our perspectives.

444
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,820
I don't know if anything really

445
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,620
being a human being, you know, this is again, Nietzsche's perspectivism.

446
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,620
Being a human being, I don't know if you can really

447
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,580
detach anything from a perspective.

448
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,100
So from a from the context, from a social context.

449
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,420
And this, again, is something I've truly begun to appreciate about postmodernist

450
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,700
that kind of skepticism, even though I understand that can easily become

451
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,220
a cynicism.

452
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,980
And that certainly isn't what I'm trying to do here,

453
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,220
even though maybe sometimes in this article, David has become a bit cynical,

454
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:36,820
but that's fine.

455
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,740
You know, we all can become,

456
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,380
life is tough, being cynical sometimes is warranted.

457
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,980
So the section that we're going to get to right now is the

458
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,580
incommensurability of Marxism and postmodernism.

459
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,380
The point David makes is simply it's wrong to claim postmodernists are

460
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,260
Marxists in disguise.

461
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,260
It's too simplistic and it's a lazy argument.

462
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,500
And David pointed out in this article,

463
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:10,140
Clare Hemmings problem problematizes this approach to postmodernism and Marxism

464
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,740
by emphasizing some of the most significant

465
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,220
differences between the two theoretical frameworks.

466
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,500
She writes that postmodernism's attention to complexity of meaning and

467
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:27,780
interpretation distracted us from the most substantive concerns with inequality,

468
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:33,780
experience, political economy and justice that Marxism attains to.

469
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,900
Hemmings extends this analysis by suggesting that without a Marxist or

470
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,300
other tangible approach to critical theory,

471
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,820
we remain powerless to alter the pernicious

472
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,940
power relations or poststructuralist tactics can cleverly identify,

473
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,620
but spectacularly fail to transform.

474
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:01,540
Hemmings's point stresses the lack of consistency between Marxist and poststructuralists theories,

475
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:08,220
demonstrating their fundamental incongruency in the domain of political action.

476
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,740
With the former emphasizing a radical transformation of capitalism into a

477
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,740
socialist system and the latter belonging to the domain of theory interested in the

478
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,140
immaterial conditions of signification.

479
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:30,940
What I got from this parallel was, you know, in a very colloquial sense, let's say,

480
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,940
Marxism is predominantly a call to political and social action.

481
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,140
You know, that's what the communist manifesto is pretty much is,

482
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,220
even though I'm not reducing Marxism just to the communist manifesto, certainly not.

483
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:48,900
But it seems clear to me, at least, as a, again, a layperson on your side,

484
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,900
that Marxism is clearly a call to action.

485
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,540
Anyone who, in my opinion, is a Marxist is sort of

486
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,940
is a concomitantly an activist.

487
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,500
There's no,

488
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,500
in my opinion, these come together,

489
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:12,060
the couple, let's say, whereas postmodernism and poststructuralism is very much

490
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,620
a theory, it's against what Clare Hemings writes about,

491
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,100
identifies here of it being

492
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,100
the importance of context, the depths and layers of meaning, all of that.

493
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,300
So it's breaking down language.

494
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,180
So it is different.

495
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:35,580
One can't just, again, as I said, prima facie attribute a postmodernist to also be

496
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:41,020
a Marxist or put it in a Petersonian way to say that postmodernism is a slight

497
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,580
of hand for Marxism.

498
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,060
And then David writes on Jean Baudrillard.

499
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:54,420
Jean Baudrillard referred to by some as the high priest of postmodernism is one

500
00:34:54,620 --> 00:35:01,980
such figure that greatly disturbs Peterson's conflation of Marxist and postmodern theories.

501
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:08,220
In the mirror of production, Baudrillard vehemently challenges Marxism asking,

502
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:14,060
are we quite simply within a mode of production at all?

503
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,340
And have we ever been in one?

504
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,900
Baudrillard extends this question by turning his critical gaze back on Marxism,

505
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,180
suggesting that Marxism is predicated on the fundamentally, this is an important

506
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,300
point, on the fundamentally Eurocentric tenants of Productivism,

507
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:40,060
scientism and historicism, and that it homogenizes

508
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:47,220
earlier societies under the light of the present structure of the capitalist economy.

509
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:52,340
Therefore, silencing specific socio-historical contexts,

510
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:57,580
projecting onto them the spectral light of political economy.

511
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,380
Oh, that was a bit dense.

512
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,060
This book marked a fundamental turning point

513
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,820
in Baudrillard's work as he grew wary of the possibility that Marxism could

514
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:15,180
actually provide the blueprints for an effective mode of societal change.

515
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:21,420
I would say as much as as much as as much of an anti-capitalist that I've become,

516
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,900
and especially in the past, say, years, so I've truly seen a lot of loopholes

517
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,820
and a lot of problems with modernity and capitalism.

518
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,940
The reason I'm still not a Marxist or I probably will never be one is because

519
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:41,540
of this coin David makes, but only Baudrillard makes, that

520
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,140
they're too materialistic.

521
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:49,060
For me, Marxism is too, it's too contemporary in that sense.

522
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,860
It's too ephemeral.

523
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:56,020
It doesn't look into the deeper realities of society and being human.

524
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,260
And again, it's too.

525
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,180
It's too, let's say, you know, I mean, there's even a term called scientific.

526
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,500
Is it called scientific socialism or scientific utopianism?

527
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:13,660
So a lot of it's heavily influenced by this post enlightenment kind of thought.

528
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,340
And it it tends to ignore so much.

529
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,660
And I want to mean it, I should say it's this is both capitalism and Marxism

530
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:25,020
tends to ignore human psychology, culture, sociology.

531
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:33,060
Therefore, Baudrillard makes a brilliant, perspicacious point here that

532
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,460
shouldn't shouldn't we be a bit critical of these

533
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,940
prescriptions we are making on society.

534
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,940
And we're saying that this will work.

535
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,260
And then David makes a comment on Foucault

536
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,260
in the order of things he systematically, when you mean he is Michel Foucault,

537
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,980
in the order of things he systematically avoids discussing Marxism.

538
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:01,140
In terms of economic theory in favor of many other liberal approaches to economics

539
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,900
indicative of the work of Adam Smith and Francois Canet.

540
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,740
Foucault does this because as he makes

541
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,100
abundantly clear, he believes that Marxism exists in 19th century thought

542
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:19,100
like a fish in water, that that is, it is unable to breathe anywhere else.

543
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,500
Foucault might the point that I was trying to make before in a much better way.

544
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,780
This is exactly what I was trying to say.

545
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,820
This sentiment resonates in harmony with the overarching themes

546
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:36,260
of his work, because he refuses to acknowledge that societal ills or power

547
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,140
can be reduced to a single structural locus.

548
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:45,340
What I read this point for a moment, I thought this was Peterson writing because

549
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,740
Peterson has made strikingly similar points to that which Foucault makes,

550
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:56,020
especially when he speaks of ideology, that the fragment can replace the whole,

551
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,220
that ideology only sees part of the picture.

552
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:06,780
So in that sense, Peterson would 100 percent agree with Foucault here.

553
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:12,060
Well, not 100 percent, because, you know, nothing works in absolutes.

554
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,180
But the point I'm trying to make is that

555
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,980
good heavens, Peterson certainly has made very similar points.

556
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,780
And back to what David's saying,

557
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,500
thus Foucault is highly skeptical of the possibility of a meaningful societal

558
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,500
revolution, because without a comprehensive evaluation of the plethora

559
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,940
of institutions that govern our daily lives, we risk perpetuating the same

560
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,580
oppressive schema.

561
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,980
And here, David makes a really interesting point.

562
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,180
He says, the thinkers that Peterson cites as

563
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,060
representatives of postmodern movement, Michel Foucault and Jacques Dorida,

564
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,820
were greatly indebted to the Western philosophical and literary canons,

565
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,300
with some commentators even labeling them neocontents.

566
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,780
Peterson's reduction of these thinkers to philosophical aberrations

567
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:11,180
detached from Western civilization, illuminates his obliviousness to said canon.

568
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,380
Great point by David here, a very important one in this article, because

569
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:21,420
this conversation Peterson had with Camille Parglayer perfectly illustrates

570
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,620
what David's saying here, because you can clearly see

571
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:29,740
both of them, Parglayer and Peterson, are being very dismissive of these

572
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,420
French intellectuals, saying that they didn't read the classics, that they weren't

573
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,380
well read in the Western canon, they were uneducated.

574
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,460
But good heavens, I mean,

575
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,900
maybe this is just my own ignorance and my lack of,

576
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,380
let's say, proper academic training.

577
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:54,420
But when I read some of, you know, I've only mostly read Sartre and Foucault.

578
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,140
I don't get the impression at all that

579
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,580
they're uneducated or that they haven't read enough Western philosophy, because

580
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,780
they seem deeply well read scholars.

581
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:11,460
And I don't think in any way one could say that their aberrations to Western

582
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,780
philosophy, in many ways,

583
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,900
as David points out, they seem to be continuing on.

584
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:24,140
I'm not saying it's just them, but they seem to be continuing on the Kantian project.

585
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:29,620
You know, all the way from Kant to Heidegger to whatever is going to come up now.

586
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,860
And I don't think the aberrations in that in that case.

587
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,140
And this conversation Peterson had with Pogliac just demonstrate,

588
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,820
I wouldn't say, like, I think the point David makes, he eliminates his own obliviousness

589
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,980
to said canon, that might be a bit unfair, but it just

590
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,820
demonstrate that deep visceral hatred

591
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:58,180
Peterson has for these French intellectuals by being sort of casually dismissive of them.

592
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,980
And then we get to another

593
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,100
very important point, and especially a point that I really enjoyed.

594
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,460
Not point a part of the essay that I really enjoyed, especially given my recent

595
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,900
let's call it an amulement with Hannah Arendt's work.

596
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:19,140
It's the section Peterson, Aaron and totalitarianism.

597
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,300
Peterson doesn't seem to mention Hannah Arendt much in his work.

598
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,100
Yes, he just speak a lot about totalitarianism for sure.

599
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,540
I mean,

600
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,820
maps of meaning was pretty much all about Peterson trying to understand,

601
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:38,820
you know, not the Nazis and totalitarianism and tyranny and all of that.

602
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:43,860
But rarely does he mention Hannah Arendt, which is quite surprising, as David points out.

603
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:49,260
He says, what is particularly striking is that Peterson makes no significant use

604
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:55,980
of Hannah Arendt, the think of fascism and totalitarianism by excellence.

605
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,820
I agree.

606
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:03,300
He just mentioned her briefly, however, suggesting that her seminal text, a text,

607
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,900
the banality of evil,

608
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,780
would have better been more appropriately titled The Evil of Banality.

609
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,420
In fact, let me find that quote so that, you know, we don't want to

610
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,540
give the impression that David's quoting Peterson out of context here.

611
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,940
It's 269.

612
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,860
I could quickly find the quote because I was going through this few days ago.

613
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,500
Peterson writes, nonetheless,

614
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,860
we are more than we see

615
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:37,940
and are more trouble than we imagine when undisciplined and unrealized.

616
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,060
The banality of evil, Hannah Arendt's

617
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:47,740
famous phrase applied to the often unprecessing Nazi personality,

618
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,380
is more accurately the evil of banality.

619
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:58,180
Our petty weaknesses accumulate and multiply and become the great evils of state.

620
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,020
As our technological power expands,

621
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:06,820
the danger we pose increases and the consequences of our voluntary stupidity

622
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:13,140
multiply is increasingly necessary that we set ourselves, not others, right.

623
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,460
And that we learn explicitly what that means.

624
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,260
Yes. So again, this is Peterson from 1999,

625
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:26,060
and he still very much talks and writes in similar prose and similar themes.

626
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,340
So again, the part I'm trying to make is David

627
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:35,020
had hasn't misquoted him in any way or quoted him out of context.

628
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:40,740
The absence of Aaron's work in Peterson's exploration of these themes is suspicious

629
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,980
and signals that his understanding of totalitarianism is missing integral

630
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,540
philosophical insight, perhaps true.

631
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,780
This is particularly true of the lineage he

632
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,260
traces between nihilism and the development of totalitarianism.

633
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,380
So another bit of an experiment I did was I went on incognito.

634
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,860
I had to and I googled

635
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,660
just plainly Jordan Peterson and Hannah Aaron.

636
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,300
And I wanted to see if there was anything that involved

637
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,860
Peterson talking about Hannah Aaron, and I couldn't find anything not in his

638
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:19,340
writing, not in his lectures. So if it is right here, in fact,

639
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,740
the only thing I found was this reddit thread of another person asking

640
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:27,620
on the Jordan Peterson subreddit, is anyone here familiar with Hannah Aaron?

641
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,940
Because both Peterson and Hannah Aaron seem to be

642
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:36,700
in the deepest possible way trying to understand totalitarianism.

643
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,140
Maybe Peterson, more from a psychological perspective, and Hannah Aaron,

644
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,940
more from a sociological and philosophical perspective.

645
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:49,260
But I would certainly imagine Peterson bringing up in more of his lectures.

646
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,940
So that is the point to keep in mind.

647
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,900
And just a completely ancillary point here.

648
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:02,820
I think what really turned me to Hannah Aaron's work again was David for sure.

649
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:08,340
But in particular, it was this series David did.

650
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,900
Hannah Aaron's The Origins of Totalitarianism.

651
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,780
In fact, I ordered the book and it's on its way.

652
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,780
I thought Amazon Prime was much faster,

653
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,180
but they're taking like weeks to build the book.

654
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,260
Doesn't matter.

655
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,980
But I want to this is going to be the next book that I read.

656
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,100
It's on my list because

657
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,220
this series David did, it was amazing.

658
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,340
I learned so much and I had to I had to read the book.

659
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,260
There was no question about it because

660
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:41,620
David converted me into an erudite, erudite.

661
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,060
Anyway,

662
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,700
and this leads to an interesting point, interesting

663
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,660
two, two, two views here, isn't it?

664
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:55,540
There's the Hannah Aaron view of the strong man, Nazi personality.

665
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:01,260
And then there's a Peterson view of the of our individual moral failings

666
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,140
that that causes nihilism and that causes the state to become corrupt.

667
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,620
So

668
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,820
how do we reconcile these two views?

669
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:09,580
I don't know.

670
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:15,420
I don't think David is set in the article, but he does point out some

671
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,540
contradictory points between Hannah Aaron's views,

672
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:23,700
where she took a much more critical philosophical lens and viewed what happened

673
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:29,660
in the 20th century and then Pearson's views that he portrays more in detail in

674
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,020
maps of meaning. Here's what David writes.

675
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,860
This idea of of of indifference and

676
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:41,180
apathy that Peterson says is what causes totalitarianism versus,

677
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,140
let's say,

678
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:48,780
taking upon responsibility, being the ubermensch or a saviour sometimes

679
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,620
and understanding that we play a role in the

680
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,860
in the birth or the imbuement of totalitarian

681
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:03,940
totalitarian states or personality or individuals or tyrants.

682
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,300
So David writes, sorry, I was very

683
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,140
inarticulate and trying to make that point.

684
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,780
I'm still learning apologies.

685
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:17,460
But David writes, as Hannah Aaron argues in the origins of totalitarianism,

686
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,220
that what is hard to pronounce?

687
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,940
It's kind of a mouthful.

688
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,260
Indifference to public affairs and new

689
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:29,580
gravity on political issues are in themselves no sufficient cause for the

690
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,820
rise of totalitarian movements.

691
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:37,140
According to Aaron, it is the strong man rather than the indifferent public that

692
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:42,060
has historically led to the rise of totalitarian regimes.

693
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:48,900
As she explains, competitive and hostile attitudes are very useful for those forms

694
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,940
of dictatorship in which a strong man takes upon himself the troublesome

695
00:48:53,940 --> 00:49:00,140
responsibility for the conduct of public affairs and hardly conforms to traditional

696
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,300
or typical definitions of nihilism.

697
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,420
This is the point.

698
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,380
This is the point.

699
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,300
This is an important point because clearly,

700
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,700
Peterson talks a lot about taking upon

701
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:16,020
carrying your own yoke to put it in Christian parlance or taking upon the world's

702
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:21,780
burdens onto oneself and then sort of being a saviour.

703
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:26,980
That in in in contrast to, let's say, apathy or indifference.

704
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:32,860
Now, Aaron says, actually, no, indifference and apathy isn't the reason that

705
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,820
totalitarianism permeates and rises.

706
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:44,780
It's rather it's this strong man, Nietzschean, ubermunch kind of personality.

707
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,700
I don't know what to make of it.

708
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:51,740
Firstly, I haven't read this book, even though I listen to David's lecture.

709
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,580
So I want to first read the book.

710
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,420
Maybe then I have a better idea.

711
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:01,060
But it certainly is something to think about, because I certainly

712
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,020
I most most definitely can see how

713
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:11,620
that idea of I think Nietzsche calls it injecting meaning into one's veins,

714
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,580
where that idea of being this

715
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,660
hyper disciplined, sort of aesthetic

716
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,980
individual who takes upon responsibility and

717
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:29,780
and has orders, hyper conscientious, how that can very easily become a peculiar kind

718
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:35,460
of hubristic, almost narcissistic

719
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:40,180
way to become a strong man and then an eventual tyrant or totalitarian, at least

720
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:44,460
psychologically, I can see how that can manifest in someone in like a sort of

721
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,700
like a psychic state.

722
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,220
And I would even say, maybe I've even seen that in some people.

723
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,020
Maybe even myself, who knows?

724
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,620
But

725
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,780
Hannah Aaron's point, it should be taken to heart.

726
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,060
It's a good point.

727
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,940
And David just laid out well here.

728
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,900
And then he gets to an interesting point here on essentialism, this idea that there

729
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,780
are essential, essential, there's an essential nature to being human, which to

730
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:17,380
some extent, I still believe I'm not a complete, in that sense, anti-essentialist.

731
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,580
But David writes,

732
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,900
Aaron's description of the strong man has founded upon the belief in a kind of

733
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:29,660
human nature, which would be subject to the same laws of growth as that of the

734
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:36,220
individual shares a strong affinity with Peterson's persistent reliance on

735
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:40,540
essentialist positions as illustrated in statements about

736
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,180
essential female and masculine pathologies.

737
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,180
Aaron elaborates on these essentialist

738
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:52,220
beliefs as irrelevant since Western philosophy and religion has been defining

739
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,620
and redefining it for more than 3,000 years.

740
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:01,060
Now, while it's true, this idea of redefining and defining, I would say,

741
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:04,140
and again, this is completely an intuition.

742
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,940
I have no firstly

743
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,660
verbal majority, but also real,

744
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:17,380
let's say, sociological and anthropological

745
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,380
evidence to back up this claim.

746
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:24,380
But I do feel intuitively when I look at many cultures and when I even just read

747
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:29,900
about cultures and even experience some cultures, there always seems to be

748
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,700
this kind of masculine and feminine, not and again, it's not a male-female thing,

749
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:40,020
because a man could be feminine and masculine both and the other way around.

750
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,860
So it's not really

751
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:49,420
a biological distinction, even though the biological distinction exists.

752
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:53,500
What I'm trying to say is this idea of the

753
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,220
of kind of an essential feminine and masculine spirit, let's say.

754
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:02,660
It does seem I don't know if it's fair to say that that doesn't exist at all,

755
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,940
because one could see it in so many different cultures all across the world.

756
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:12,860
And if something is that common, isn't that maybe pointing towards some kind

757
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,500
of deep truth? Who knows?

758
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,420
But again,

759
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:21,460
the point, David's the more deeper point David's trying to make here is that

760
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,860
that that attitude of essentialism could lead to

761
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:30,340
this totalitarian kind of mindset where you say, this is the way things should be

762
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,300
done, this absolutist,

763
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,220
almost despotic attitude that this is the way this should be done.

764
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,180
So that certainly begs the question.

765
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,740
And David doesn't really point this out in the article, but this is exactly what

766
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:47,020
I was thinking while I was reading it is,

767
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,900
is how do we properly take Peterson's,

768
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,500
this adopt responsibility or personal responsibility mantra too hard,

769
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,660
which I think is a good message.

770
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:03,140
But how do we prevent it from being pathologized as a drive to be a totalitarian?

771
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,980
Because

772
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:07,660
and this is something I realized recently,

773
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,580
enlargement thinking, we like to think that it was all about freedom and liberty

774
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,820
and equality.

775
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,820
But no, it certainly had an absolutist attitude towards it.

776
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,020
You know, Hobbes, for example.

777
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,660
So there were many enlightenment thinkers who were absolutist.

778
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:28,700
And more importantly, the deeper point is the idea of there being, let's say,

779
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,300
categories and that is essential, this attitude of enlightenment thinking

780
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:37,460
that can be certainly connected or even imbue

781
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:41,140
tyrannical, totalitarian sort of thinking.

782
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,820
So

783
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,020
it's how do we delineate that?

784
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,020
And it's very it's very nuanced there.

785
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:52,020
And I really didn't think of this until

786
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,380
maybe one or two years ago.

787
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,380
So

788
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,780
something to ponder and reflect on.

789
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,740
And now we get to the most,

790
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:06,340
in my opinion, the part I like the most and the most interesting part of the article,

791
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:10,180
especially because I'm a Nietzschean and and the more I read Nietzsche,

792
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,300
the more I thought, oh, Peterson's, there's something if people don't

793
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,980
read Nietzsche and listen to Peterson lecture on Nietzsche,

794
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:22,260
they'd get a completely different picture on who Nietzsche is.

795
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,180
But in any case, I am a Nietzschean and I really like this part.

796
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,380
And I thought David made some good points.

797
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:32,380
So the question is, is Peterson misappropriating Nietzsche?

798
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,460
What I mean by this is I'm not saying

799
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:38,980
Peterson is misquoting or quoting man of context or trying to,

800
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:45,580
yeah, intentionally misappropriate him with some kind of

801
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:50,780
underlying motive, unethical underlying motive, not at all.

802
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,900
But sometimes because like all of us,

803
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,420
Peterson's got his own ideology.

804
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:00,660
I'm wondering if what he's really doing is just taking something Nietzsche said

805
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:04,020
and just fitting it into his philosophy, his ideology.

806
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,700
And then, you know, sharing it with the public.

807
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,700
Whereas

808
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,980
this isn't what Nietzsche would say.

809
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:17,260
So as in this synthesis, let's say, of taking what Nietzsche said and

810
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,940
synthesizing it along with what Peterson's saying and whatever that result is,

811
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,980
Nietzsche would completely disagree with what the result is.

812
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:30,140
He would be totally opposed to Nietzsche's overall philosophy,

813
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:33,660
even though Nietzsche hasn't really got one set philosophy.

814
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,180
And I think he did that intentionally.

815
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,180
So there is one has to be careful.

816
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,380
One has to be careful when when they

817
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:47,620
try to understand Nietzsche through a Petersonian lens, let's say.

818
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,980
David writes,

819
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:55,100
in the birth of tragedy, Nietzsche argues that the notion of truth that runs

820
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,500
through the course of history, history, the course of history,

821
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:04,140
are founded not on their object, objectivity, but in their

822
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,900
continual self proclamation of objectivity.

823
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:12,580
For Nietzsche, the shift from language to science plays a scientific method at

824
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,380
the forefront of Western civilization,

825
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,540
making everything quantifiable under the scientific gaze.

826
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:25,940
As he explains, it is language which works on building the edifice of concepts.

827
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,300
Later, it is science.

828
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:32,580
Nietzsche expands on this idea of writing.

829
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:37,260
What I understand about the spirit of science is the belief which first came to

830
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:42,620
light in the person of Socrates, that the depths of nature can be fathomed

831
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:46,340
and that knowledge can heal all ills.

832
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:52,860
According to Nietzsche, this belief in the ultimate infallibility of science or

833
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:56,100
Socrates's tendency to murder are

834
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,300
is destructive, especially when left unacknowledged.

835
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,820
Now, Peterson here would certainly agree with this point, because

836
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,500
I've listened to a couple of interviews where Peterson comments on Stephen

837
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,740
Pinker's Enlightenment Now, and he pretty much says that he's quite

838
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,900
disappointed that in Enlightenment Now,

839
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:21,060
Stephen Pinker has all these chapters dedicated to the scientific method,

840
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,380
Enlightenment, freedom, democracy, all that.

841
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,900
And a little chapter towards the latter part of the book.

842
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,460
I haven't read the book, so I'm not really sure, even though I think I've got a copy.

843
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,700
Where he dedicates to the arts and the humanities.

844
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,820
And he says that that's unfortunate, because really it should be the other way

845
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:44,260
around, because most of life or most of what we are is, let's say,

846
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,300
we should be indebted to the arts and the humanities.

847
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,940
And science is very, very much a new phenomenon.

848
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,060
It's a new thing in our society.

849
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,780
Therefore, it is a good point.

850
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:02,060
To Nietzsche, science is truly capable of confining the individual within the

851
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,780
smallest circle of solvable tasks.

852
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:10,100
As he explains, science, spurred on by its powerful delusion,

853
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:16,020
is hurrying unstoppable to its limits, where the optimism hidden in the essence

854
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:20,300
of logic will founder and break up.

855
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,740
So then we get to Nietzsche versus 12 Rules for Life.

856
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,500
And this is kind of the point I made when I started commenting on the section

857
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:33,260
where if Nietzsche read 12 Rules for Life, he probably disagreed with most of it.

858
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,900
And David explains why.

859
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:40,420
12 Rules for Life proclaiming the necessity for people, young men.

860
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:45,780
I want to say, you know, David's put this in here kind of as like a slight comment,

861
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,580
you know, kind of being dismissive that all Peterson only caters to this certain

862
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:55,020
demographic, it seems like a straw man and a ad hominem attack.

863
00:59:55,220 --> 01:00:01,260
Because firstly, ad hominem as if helping young men makes him a particular evil person.

864
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,860
I mean, I don't see what's wrong with helping young men.

865
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,260
You know, if people need help, people should get help.

866
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,380
I'm a young man.

867
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,860
And when I was 20, 21, reading Jordan Peterson's book helped me a lot.

868
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,980
It gave me structure and meaning and purpose.

869
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,140
And those things matter.

870
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,460
Life is difficult.

871
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,460
And I'm truly grateful for that.

872
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:23,500
And other than that, Peterson,

873
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,780
I know a lot of, in fact, a lot of the people that I know who are Jordan Peterson fans,

874
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,340
let's say, are women.

875
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:37,580
Funny enough, one of my good friends, she and I, we'll be going to the

876
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,820
Jordan Peterson comes to Melbourne, he's visiting Melbourne at the end of the yard

877
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,620
and we bought tickets for his kind of talk.

878
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,100
And I'll be going with him.

879
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,980
She really, she loves Jordan Peterson.

880
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:53,020
So I don't know if it's fair that, you know, it's it's sort of like a straw man

881
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:58,180
and a hominem and also, frankly, such slight comments seem unproductive.

882
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,260
I mean, such a good article.

883
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,620
And it's just saying young men as if it's a bad thing.

884
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:07,420
It cheapens and reduces this well written article to that of a

885
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,780
headpiece by some corporate media journalists.

886
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:11,980
And that's unfortunate.

887
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:15,100
But anyway, it's just a little bit of criticism that I had,

888
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:19,020
a little bit of criticism that I have.

889
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,020
So I'll get back to it.

890
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:24,340
Twirlers for life proclaiming the necessity for people to adopt an aesthetic

891
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:29,500
lifestyle in the form of a mutated Christian conservatism, conservatism,

892
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:35,980
stands diametrically opposed to Nietzsche's central claim in the genealogy of morality,

893
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:43,540
that the aesthetic ideal is not something to strive for, but rather it is the consequence

894
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:49,580
of a life attempting to inject artificial meaning into its veins in a poor attempt

895
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:54,700
at inoculation from degeneration.

896
01:01:54,900 --> 01:02:02,060
In this capacity, Peterson resembles the ascetic priest that Nietzsche castigates.

897
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:08,060
The task of intellectual should should not be to inject arbitrary rules and

898
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,900
regulations into people, but rather to foster

899
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:18,140
a spectacular scene that welcomes more eyes, various eyes,

900
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:24,260
we are able to use to sketch a more complete understanding of our objectivity.

901
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:25,420
Superlative point.

902
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:31,620
In my opinion, this little para here or this little part sentence, let's say,

903
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,980
it's the best sentence in the whole article.

904
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:38,260
Really good point, because it's something I began to realize,

905
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:46,180
maybe again, two or three years ago, because I saw that in our new age

906
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:51,700
entrenched culture, it seems like every public intellectual is becoming a self

907
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,540
help guru, and that's kind of unfortunate because there's nothing wrong with self

908
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:58,100
help, but we should understand that everything has its place.

909
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,020
Self help should be separated from

910
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:05,300
intellectualism and public or public intellectuals, because it seems like

911
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:09,860
you know, a lot of even the Sam Harris, you know, he's got meditation and mindfulness.

912
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:13,340
A lot of public intellectuals have just become self help gurus,

913
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,380
kind of the celebrity self self help gurus, and that's unfortunate because the

914
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:21,940
what intellectual, in my opinion, should do is not reaffirm what you already believe.

915
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:27,540
But yes, as David beautifully puts it, it clearly points out.

916
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:32,140
Really make us feel uncomfortable in our beliefs, make us make us completely

917
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:35,740
change our perspectives and view the world in different lenses and give us

918
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:43,980
kind of perspectival seeing Adorno had a great quote, I think, in a aesthetic theory.

919
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:49,740
I'm completely paraphrasing here, but he says and he's talking about art here.

920
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:55,180
He says, Adorno, that the real purpose of art should be to.

921
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:57,140
Sort of.

922
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,700
I can't really remember the quote, but the idea is the purpose of art should be

923
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:07,420
to make us feel uncomfortable, to challenge our dogmas, our pre-health beliefs and really.

924
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:13,060
You know, lift, change our life radically and fundamentally in how we view the world.

925
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,620
And in my opinion, that's also what a public

926
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:18,580
intellectual should do, not become a self help guru.

927
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,220
And if they want to become self help guru, there's nothing wrong with that.

928
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,540
That's that's OK.

929
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,660
But then there's something else.

930
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:27,860
They're not a public intellectual or an intellectual for that matter.

931
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:33,260
So this is probably the best point David makes in the whole article.

932
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:37,580
Peterson's project is that is an attempt then to move away from the Nietzsche

933
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:43,460
notion of perspectival scene toward the domain of a historical, a contextual scene.

934
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:48,500
This narrowing of possibility operates to maintain the authority of those who choose

935
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:53,660
what is considered worth seeing and through that through and through what needs

936
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,580
pushing society towards sovereign and

937
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:00,260
the tutorial rule. Again, this last bit here

938
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:05,860
is quite apt to the whole covid lockdown controversy debate that a lot of people

939
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:09,060
got got into in the intellectual dark web.

940
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,980
I'm using that as an umbrella term

941
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:15,940
for like the Peterson's and the Sam Harris's.

942
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,860
That's again, that idea of perspectival

943
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:18,820
thing is quite important here.

944
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:23,420
So then we get to the section where it's the science versus Peterson.

945
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:26,580
And then David comments on

946
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:34,660
some of the Aristotelian notions of science.

947
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,940
He writes,

948
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:41,860
though Peterson's line of argumentation seems to suggest a science postmodernism

949
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:47,260
opposition, a considerable number of scientific journals have published articles

950
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:53,700
addressing the growing stigmatization and discrimination, trans and gender

951
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,900
queer people experience regularly.

952
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:57,900
It's a good point.

953
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,780
A lot of us don't spend the time to go and read up on these articles,

954
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:06,500
but there certainly is a a good amount of literature that probably uses the

955
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,020
scientific method to point this out.

956
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:09,860
So it is true.

957
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:13,060
There is that stigmatization

958
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,860
within trans people, especially maybe because it's now it's become a lot more

959
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,500
political. And that's quite unfortunate.

960
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:22,020
That is that is deep.

961
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,740
I hate saying that's quite that's quite

962
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,260
unfortunate because it's like a throwaway term for everything these days.

963
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,180
But that's that's a that's a sad truth.

964
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:32,380
And we should think about that.

965
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,980
We should think about that.

966
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:38,180
Such articles, though they conform to the same

967
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:45,420
scientific rationale utilized by Peterson, shed light on the great deal of contradictions,

968
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:51,940
oppositions and diversion, believes in this supposedly objective field of study.

969
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,580
This is an important point David makes.

970
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:58,460
These studies correspond to the domain of research that aligns with the

971
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:03,020
Aristotelian Aristotelian, God, I can't pronounce that,

972
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:08,420
aligns with the Aristotelian maxim of phronesis, which may be understood as

973
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:14,860
fostering practical intellectual activity aimed at clarifying the problems

974
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:21,220
risks and possibilities we face as humans and society, societies.

975
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:25,420
This approach, although still immersed in the scientific tradition,

976
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:32,420
stands opposed to the other domain of Aristotelian reason of episteme

977
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:36,700
that proclaims the a priori nature of scientific knowledge.

978
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,700
So this again kind of touches on that.

979
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:42,660
How do we derive Oates plainly from science?

980
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:48,980
Because it seems like the scientific institution itself is,

981
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:53,580
let's say, bifurcated into this phronesis and episteme.

982
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:59,980
And in many ways, phronesis does help us derive Oates,

983
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,820
but it is complicated because that also involves

984
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:09,620
contextual seeing, sociology, sociology, all of that.

985
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:13,340
This brand of research, while disavowed by Peterson,

986
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:18,060
presents a foray into the lives and experiences of marginalized groups

987
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,260
that would otherwise be silenced, absolutely.

988
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:26,700
And now another interesting point I would say from the whole article,

989
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:32,700
my favorite parts were Nietzsche and postmodernism and the

990
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,820
Baudrillard reality and truth.

991
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:42,460
Well worth a read, just just do those two parts.

992
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:47,660
The question asks the question that Baudrillard asks us, what is objective truth?

993
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:52,660
Job Baudrillard has vigorously challenged the position held by scholars such as

994
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:58,180
Peterson on objectivity and truth, suggesting instead that science like any

995
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:04,700
discourse is organized on the basis of a conventional logic,

996
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:09,620
adding that it explains things which have been defined

997
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:16,860
and formalized in advance, which subsequently conform to these explanations.

998
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,940
And again, Peterson would agree with this point because I've listened to his

999
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:24,540
conversations with recently Richard Dawkins and then Sam Harris,

1000
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,780
where they get into the fact value distinction.

1001
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:34,860
And again, one would assume that Peterson would find a certain

1002
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:40,220
certain validity in what Baudrillard's pointing out here, because

1003
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:43,660
in that sense, Richard Feynman, I'm I'm

1004
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:48,660
connecting many figures here, Richard Feynman, probably my favorite scientist.

1005
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,020
I love listening to his lectures.

1006
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:54,820
He is actually wrong to say the philosophy of science is as useful to

1007
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:59,060
scientists as ornithology is to birds.

1008
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:01,780
That's that's a that's a wrong statement.

1009
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:04,660
That's an invalid statement, in my opinion, because no, no, no,

1010
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:07,500
the philosophy of science is a part of the scientific process.

1011
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,500
It's a part of the scientific institution.

1012
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:15,980
In many ways, it maybe is what this Aristotelian frenesis is about.

1013
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:22,580
We need to understand what science is and how we make our presuppositions.

1014
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,020
Oh, sorry, on what

1015
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:28,860
on what presuppositions we start from, on what axioms.

1016
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,700
And that's a good heavens.

1017
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:35,900
That's probably that probably is the fundamental question of science these days.

1018
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,340
How do we make our assumptions?

1019
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,700
Where what's the starting point?

1020
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:44,660
And again, I think apart from the conversations that I've

1021
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:49,700
heard Peterson have, he probably understands that this problem inherently

1022
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,100
exists in our modern conception of science.

1023
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:57,460
It's probably why he's interested in Jung in archetypes and

1024
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:03,100
Christian Neoplatonism, symbolism and in general, religious narrative,

1025
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:09,140
because he sees those to be a sort of he sees that can be coupled with science

1026
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:14,460
to find some kind of, let's say, objective starting point for science to work off.

1027
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:18,980
And I don't know if that's possible, but it certainly at least points to the

1028
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:21,180
problem or hints at the problem.

1029
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:26,380
So David states, Baudrillard doesn't say that scientific conclusions are invalid.

1030
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,500
He actually doesn't, I think.

1031
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:33,900
I haven't read much Baudrillard, obviously, but I don't get that impression, at least.

1032
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:39,300
But what he says very clearly is that whatever these scientific conclusions are,

1033
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:46,620
these conclusions should not be transposed onto any societal or cultural context.

1034
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:53,060
So these studies, some studies that he cited above in the article,

1035
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:58,620
the studies speak to the late Baudrillard's conception of singularity.

1036
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:04,740
OK, I'm going to say this is a part that I kind of am struggling to grok yet.

1037
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:07,260
I still can't fathom it.

1038
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:11,140
I don't know, for me, it still seems incomprehensible, but I think it's because I

1039
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:14,700
haven't done enough reading, I haven't done enough studying to Baudrillard.

1040
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,580
So David writes,

1041
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:24,100
Baudrillard's conception of singularity, which holds that every detail of the world

1042
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,260
is perfect if it is not referred to some larger set.

1043
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:34,700
Reality for Baudrillard is always caught in a play of signification and suggestions

1044
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:39,380
of a naturality made by the authoritative

1045
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:44,420
scientific community, mistake the only true nature of the world as a world of

1046
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:51,860
appearances in which there may not be anything but a discourse of the real and the rational.

1047
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:57,340
Just a point here, the idea of I think this in many ways is the

1048
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:01,220
scientific question. Oh, sorry, the philosophical question and the philosophical

1049
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:09,620
battle that we've been having since time immorial, ever since Socrates, Plato, all that is.

1050
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:15,300
In our epistemology, how do we know what's true and how do we know what's

1051
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,700
appearing as true?

1052
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:21,300
It seems to be the distinction between, let's say, the

1053
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:26,900
the rationalist and the empiricists between the

1054
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:33,700
Joan Locke and the David Hume or the continental philosophers and then the

1055
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,780
English analytical philosophers.

1056
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:40,020
How do we know what's true and what appears as true?

1057
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:44,900
So that's such an important point and Baudrillard is,

1058
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:50,100
in many ways, Baudrillard's working off that here.

1059
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,740
According to Baudrillard,

1060
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:59,580
then notions of an objective truth are fundamentally flawed and any attempt to occupy

1061
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:04,700
an objective field of study is bound to fail and merely become

1062
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:10,620
signs, signifiers of a real signified.

1063
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:14,220
I hope there's a bit of a wordplay there, that's difficult to understand.

1064
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:18,900
The fundamental impossibility of performing objective studies and or

1065
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:24,580
revealing fundamental truths is understood by Baudrillard and his theory of simulation.

1066
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:30,780
For Baudrillard, simulation occurs when the world has become real beyond our

1067
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:34,180
wildest expectations

1068
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:38,620
and can be described as the outcome of calculated

1069
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:42,740
move to put the illusion of the world to death.

1070
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:50,940
Scientific discourse that rely on notions on notions of objectivity and truth,

1071
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:57,580
therefore dissolve into the imaginary of the sign or the sphere of truth

1072
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:03,700
and leaves us with reality and therefore simulation in all its glory.

1073
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:09,620
The real then is merely a particular case of that simulation that Baudrillard

1074
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:14,820
argues, loves our society to think itself

1075
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:19,340
and live itself as superior to all others.

1076
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:25,220
Baudrillard's work can be read as not necessarily opposing the domain of scientific

1077
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:30,140
inquiry, but accounting for the degree to which science,

1078
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:34,980
but accounting for the degree to which any scientific inquiry should be attuned to

1079
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:40,140
the cultural and significator conditions of the object of study.

1080
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:46,140
So now here's where, again, I completely

1081
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:50,580
attribute this to my lack of understanding, my lack of knowledge.

1082
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:54,900
The reason I'm saying that is not for some kind of false modesty or false humility.

1083
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,940
It's because genuinely, I haven't done enough study and reading.

1084
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,700
This is in my field of study.

1085
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:05,860
I haven't gone through the proper formal academic process of studying all its

1086
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:09,300
philosophers, I'm a autodidact.

1087
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:12,300
I'm doing it on my own.

1088
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,420
But really, sometimes when I read these kind

1089
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:21,260
of paragraphs, I do wonder, is this some kind of word game that these thinkers

1090
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:26,900
are playing with their brilliant verbal and intellectual capabilities

1091
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,300
with their ability to write?

1092
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:33,100
And is it some kind of game?

1093
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,980
I don't even mean game in a cynical way.

1094
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:39,700
I mean, is it truly a way to try to

1095
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:45,620
make some pre-held belief they have and try to make it look as if something

1096
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:51,100
that's true about the world and make it cohere using language?

1097
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:57,780
Is it is it a language game to sound with with with with with I don't know,

1098
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:02,540
because, OK, when I read this, even though, as I said before, I don't fully

1099
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:07,580
comprehend it or fully understand it, I certainly can see that it's it's

1100
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:15,260
intimations of something true, something that's topically true about reality.

1101
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:23,020
And it points to so many different domains of our current way of doing the world.

1102
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:26,060
And for me, that coheres, even though what they're trying to say really doesn't

1103
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,980
cohere, if that makes sense.

1104
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:31,460
Like what I'm trying to say is sort of

1105
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:35,340
it's a normatively some of what they're saying is like, oh, yeah, that I can see

1106
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:39,300
how how they come to these conclusions.

1107
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:43,900
OK, I don't know, just thinking out loud here, as I tend to do in this podcast.

1108
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:49,460
And on the topic of not understanding things, I would say, again, not David's

1109
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:54,980
fault, my own fault, my own ignorance, I truly thought it hard to understand this

1110
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:59,580
section, Baudrillard Butler and those voices of the marginalized.

1111
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:02,980
So that's about the whole essay.

1112
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,660
That's about three or four paragraphs.

1113
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:10,820
And here's the thing, I think part of it was because simply it's that section

1114
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:15,860
of the essay about the gender controversy that I didn't really care that much to be

1115
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:20,980
frank. And I think I just truly couldn't I couldn't penetrate it.

1116
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:21,940
That's what it was.

1117
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:26,020
It was the reason I found it a bit incomprehensible was because

1118
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:29,980
I could see that David's making some important points here, but I couldn't.

1119
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:31,340
I don't know. I didn't know why.

1120
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,340
But for example, the previous points, even though there were parts of it that I

1121
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:39,660
didn't really get, I at least I at least got the essence of his argument.

1122
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:43,940
I was getting at where he was going to it.

1123
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:47,060
But this section for me, I just couldn't I couldn't penetrate it.

1124
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:51,900
And it it didn't click with me to put it plainly.

1125
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,540
And apart from that,

1126
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,900
this is just a complete personal thing.

1127
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:02,860
I've recently been trying to study Heidegger, been trying to get through being in time.

1128
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:06,620
Mate, I am eternally perplexed about everything.

1129
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:10,780
I haven't really, if you can probably see from this podcast, I haven't got anything

1130
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:15,620
substantial or coherent to say, but especially phenomenology, but virtually

1131
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:20,100
anything because Heidegger has completely

1132
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,780
overturned my views on so many things.

1133
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:25,780
So

1134
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:28,060
yeah, I'm in this place of this deep.

1135
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:32,340
I'm I'm self I'm being extremely self critical of what I believe.

1136
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:37,380
And I'm also very uncertain about virtually all my beliefs.

1137
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:42,620
And that on that rather legubrious note, let's go to the conclusion.

1138
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,380
But before I do read the conclusion, I want to say something.

1139
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:50,180
Firstly, I want to say I think Peterson

1140
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:55,540
totally deeply understands everything that David points out here, even though

1141
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:57,780
he isn't very explicit about it.

1142
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:02,580
He does get his he sees this inherent

1143
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:08,300
income and stability between between what we have as modern science and how can we

1144
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,820
derive values from it?

1145
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:14,380
He sees the incomes, income and stability between what

1146
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:19,260
modernity tells us and the deeper truth that postmodernist found this idea of

1147
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:24,100
context, he's even said it in a couple of his podcasts that he does agree

1148
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:30,140
with this notion of the complexity of interpretations and how much,

1149
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:34,540
how deep that that really goes into reality in some sense, not just at,

1150
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:38,820
let's say, at the level of text or hermeneutics, but that this this this

1151
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:41,340
the problem of interpretation is a big problem.

1152
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:45,940
And he points to AI researchers, he points to many, many places within the field

1153
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:48,100
of science to to hit at that.

1154
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,700
So I think he gets it.

1155
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:54,580
And I would say it's because of that, maybe that I say that I,

1156
01:20:54,780 --> 01:21:00,100
apart from him as a person, but just at an intellectual, I began to admire him

1157
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:05,020
a lot more because he's willing to publicly flesh out these ideas and make

1158
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:09,580
mistakes publicly, especially someone like him who's got such public acclaim.

1159
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:14,060
And, and, you know, because he gets himself in all his political controversies,

1160
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:18,420
the moment he makes a mistake, he is hammered and he is,

1161
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:22,580
is there always caving critiques written about him, which can be quite difficult

1162
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:23,940
being a public figure.

1163
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:28,300
One shouldn't just think that that's it's quite hard to go through that.

1164
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,660
It's it's a lot of stress.

1165
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:36,460
So I do admire that kind of courage that he has to publicly deal with these issues.

1166
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,380
And

1167
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:42,980
I I've got to say I am a bit disheartened that I

1168
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:48,380
feel like with time, with his influence, he's becoming more and more ideological

1169
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:54,860
and even a bit more dogmatic in his in his beliefs and his views, which for me

1170
01:21:55,060 --> 01:22:00,140
is unfortunate because then this project, he has to work this out to try and reconcile

1171
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:04,540
these, if it's reconcilable, these

1172
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:07,060
incumbents or abilities,

1173
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:11,620
I feel like that then he won't have a genuine journey in doing that because if

1174
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:14,780
he becomes more and more, let's say, dogmatic in his views,

1175
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:17,780
I really hope that he doesn't go there.

1176
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:22,700
But again, all the points David makes in this article, I think is very apt to who

1177
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:27,220
Jordan Peterson is and I think he gets it.

1178
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:29,980
Secondly, I want to say, David,

1179
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:33,540
if you have, if you do watch this episode, I really hope you do.

1180
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:37,460
I want to try and treat this at you a couple of times to to try and get your

1181
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:40,940
attention. But if you do watch this episode and if you come this far,

1182
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,860
mate, I know I'm very, very long winded.

1183
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,260
It's a problem of mine.

1184
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,620
I never get to the point.

1185
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,820
But if you come this far, I would like to

1186
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:53,420
sincerely invite you on the podcast for an interview because I would love to talk

1187
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:56,580
to you and learn from you. I have so many questions.

1188
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:58,940
I got to say, David, again,

1189
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:04,180
not blowing steam up your ass, put it in a vulgar way.

1190
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:08,540
You truly have been that kind of intellectual that you talk about this

1191
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:11,020
part here about perspectival scene.

1192
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:15,340
You probably are seeing right now me learning from you and trying to

1193
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:20,620
try to see the world and see all these topics through different perspectives

1194
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:25,100
and different views, because you foster that kind of perspective of seeing in me.

1195
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:29,340
So and I'm a product of in that sense of your YouTube channel,

1196
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:33,660
a living example, let's say, to put it in a dramatic way.

1197
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:39,940
And again, your work on Hannah Irwin has made me fall in love with her in some sense.

1198
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:43,500
Maybe, you know, in fact, maybe I should have you on the podcast if you do agree

1199
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:50,580
that is, of course, after I'm done reading the origins of totalitarianism.

1200
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:53,820
Because then I'll have something a bit more substantial to discuss with you.

1201
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:56,620
But again, this is my invite to the podcast.

1202
01:23:56,820 --> 01:24:04,540
And on that note, I would read the conclusion to the article and end this episode.

1203
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:10,540
Beyond locating the various contradictions and fallacious remarks Peterson makes,

1204
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:18,340
this paper has also argued that Peterson's assault against Bill C-16 risks mirroring

1205
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:26,140
the same systemic instantiations of totalitarianism that he claims to know so much about.

1206
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,300
To reiterate,

1207
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:33,060
this is not to suggest that he represents these movements directly,

1208
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:38,540
but that there are many affinities between these oppressive ideological systems

1209
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:42,180
and Peterson's faith in a universal conception of truth.

1210
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:44,580
That's to a point.

1211
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:50,100
This paper serves the purpose of mounting a philosophically analytical rebuttal

1212
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:56,260
to Peterson's central claims by pointing an eminent critique.

1213
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:58,940
Pointing to the many shortcomings of his

1214
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:05,980
speculations and locating epistemic fallacies that may be observed in his ideas.

1215
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:11,020
This is a necessary form of critique because unlike the Hegelian model of

1216
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:18,300
oppositional politics that poses a critique from an antithetical and exterior

1217
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:24,820
positionality, this form identifies the core of the theoretical inadequacy

1218
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,300
of Peterson's project from the inside.

1219
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,700
And I think, David, you accomplished that.
