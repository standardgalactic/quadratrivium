00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Firstly, I would say, in my view, self-help is a post-modern phenomenon, and what I mean

00:05.680 --> 00:12.560
by that is that, which is perhaps why that self-help, as you said, Joanne, it doesn't

00:12.560 --> 00:18.320
really have, it doesn't question the odds, it doesn't question what's driving us towards

00:18.320 --> 00:26.400
the point B, from A to B. So it's purely focused on the systems. It's like a ruthless pragmatism.

00:26.400 --> 00:31.520
It's just get it done. This is how you get it done. Apply these frameworks. James

00:31.520 --> 00:40.800
Clears Atomic Habits or whatnot. My critique of self-help comes in two ways. Firstly, in a more

00:40.800 --> 00:46.880
existential sense, and then afterwards, certainly my political critique, where I critique the ideology

00:46.880 --> 00:55.280
of self-help. So the existential one is rather interesting because here's what I put it this

00:55.280 --> 01:01.040
way. So as you were talking, it reminded me of Camus's quote from the shoot, The Fool. He says,

01:03.040 --> 01:09.200
sorry, a man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of

01:09.200 --> 01:15.440
the life are devoted to the earning of that money. Happiness is forgotten. The means are taken for

01:15.440 --> 01:22.720
the end. So I'll just replace money with self-help there. It'll go like this then. A man wants to

01:22.800 --> 01:29.600
practice self-help in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of the life are devoted

01:29.600 --> 01:37.600
to the earnings of that money or to the practice of self-help. Happiness is forgotten. The means

01:37.600 --> 01:43.680
are taken for the end. Now, happiness is forgotten. Again, happiness is not a big deal here, but let's

01:43.680 --> 01:48.800
assume in the context of this quote, the happiness is an ought. I ought to be happy. It's the B,

01:48.800 --> 01:55.680
the person's moving towards. So within this, though, what I've seen with self-help is that

01:55.680 --> 02:03.600
essentially speaking, the means are taken, the means replace the end. The means don't become

02:04.320 --> 02:10.160
just a means to an end. They become the end in themselves. So what happens is when people get

02:10.160 --> 02:16.960
obsessed with self-help, all their life, all their life, all they do is try to optimize everything.

02:17.520 --> 02:25.120
They try to meditate, run cold showers, read myriad self-help books. In fact, I saw this

02:25.120 --> 02:30.400
really interesting statistic. I can't pull it up now because I got to find it, but it said that

02:30.400 --> 02:36.000
majority of people who buy, so majority of people that buy self-help commodities, so except for

02:36.000 --> 02:41.920
products, whatever, courses, books, all that, they're generally a really high number, like 80

02:41.920 --> 02:46.320
or 90% of it, they're recurring customers. It's the same people that keep buying this stuff.

02:46.960 --> 02:52.320
Because what happens is, I think people get to use a Lacanian term, a sense of Jewish zones,

02:52.320 --> 02:59.360
from just the act of engaging in self-help. I'm going to read 10 self-help books despite all of

02:59.360 --> 03:03.440
them virtually saying the same thing. It's not that advanced. It's just basic stuff. You don't

03:03.440 --> 03:08.320
have to be a genius to have habits, be disciplined, have some framework, have a calendar, have a to-do

03:08.320 --> 03:14.480
list. I mean, no shit Sherlock. You don't have to be a genius to know that. But then people get,

03:15.280 --> 03:20.000
like, you know, what's this, Tiago 40 is a second brain thing where you optimize everything's

03:20.000 --> 03:26.320
productive. From the processes itself, people find a great sense of pleasure, although I would use a

03:26.320 --> 03:35.120
more psychoanalytical term, Jewish zones, where then there's no real, they really aren't really

03:35.120 --> 03:40.320
doing anything apart from optimizing their lives, apart from self-helping, you know, and that that

03:40.320 --> 03:44.480
becomes a whole lot. And it's kind of a sad existence if you think about it, because like,

03:44.480 --> 03:49.840
there's no creative outlet. There's nothing, there's no creation per se. It's just this like very,

03:49.840 --> 03:56.960
in a peculiar sense, narcissistic obsession with the self. And my question, the way I like

03:56.960 --> 04:01.280
always think is like, I like to think of, for humans, you know, I'm a Hegelian, so we're historical

04:01.280 --> 04:10.720
beings, right? Imagine if Napoleon or Churchill spent, you know, six, seven hours a day focused on

04:10.720 --> 04:16.160
self-help. Like imagine Napoleon before he went to, you know, was trying to beat the Nazis, woke up

04:16.160 --> 04:21.120
in the morning, meditated, you know, had the cold shower and did all these things. We would probably

04:21.120 --> 04:24.960
all be speaking German and you and I probably wouldn't even be born. We've probably been some,

04:24.960 --> 04:28.640
our parents would have died in some concentration. One would imagine Napoleon to have been more

04:28.640 --> 04:34.480
effective, but I don't think that would be the case. You would have not stopped reading.

04:34.480 --> 04:40.240
Yeah, you see a self-help ideologue would say, oh, if Napoleon or if Churchill did all these

04:40.240 --> 04:44.960
optimization things, they would be even better at that, whatever they did as leaders, let's say.

04:44.960 --> 04:52.640
I disagree. I think the greatness that doesn't come from this very little tweaks, optimization

04:52.640 --> 04:57.040
here and there. It comes from something even beyond what you can articulate. It comes from

04:57.040 --> 05:03.440
to the ancient term from trying to be that ubermunch, you know. So it comes from, in some sense,

05:03.440 --> 05:07.760
the greatness comes from some kind of insanity. There's like a sense of insanity to what they're

05:07.760 --> 05:16.240
doing and self-help ruins all of that. It makes you a very tepid vanilla kind of person and that's

05:16.240 --> 05:20.800
why I'm going to be totally honest, man. Most people I talk to who are hyper obsessed with

05:20.800 --> 05:25.680
self-help and I used to be one of these people. So I kind of know a few people who I used to be

05:25.680 --> 05:30.480
a part of a pyramid scheme at MLM. Unfortunately, I got sucked in as a kid. So I still know a few

05:30.480 --> 05:34.960
people who are in that circle. Great people, lovely people. We all do. We all do. Yeah,

05:34.960 --> 05:39.600
everyone did a part of Amway, right? It's just like, I think Bill Clinton was a part of Amway.

05:39.600 --> 05:45.200
So anyway, lovely people, but man, they're so boring. All they do is obsess over like,

05:45.200 --> 05:50.240
focus on your dreams, your goals. I think the interesting thing is they're very,

05:50.240 --> 05:53.680
you can say they're boring, but they're also very obnoxious in a very interesting way.

05:53.760 --> 05:58.240
Oh, I mean, look, okay, I can't speak for being obnoxious because I'm an obnoxious guy.

05:58.240 --> 06:02.800
No, that's true. That's true. I tend to be this. I tend to be on the top of my head.

06:02.800 --> 06:08.560
Okay, so maybe just what I wanted to mention earlier as well, and you will tie here, it's like

06:10.080 --> 06:15.840
how self-help used to look like was morals, right? It's a lot of morals and ethics,

06:15.840 --> 06:22.240
but then there wasn't the end alone. I would say it's frenesis to use a term by Aristotle.

06:22.240 --> 06:28.320
Frenesis is kind of this like pragmatic wisdom. Very sort of easy system. Frenesis,

06:28.320 --> 06:34.320
which is like a very interesting. I haven't heard of that one. It's like how to engage in the world

06:34.320 --> 06:40.560
as a virtuous person. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. And I think that's D,

06:41.280 --> 06:45.040
like it's along the lines of how to look it up to self. It's virtue, right? But it's actually,

06:45.040 --> 06:49.120
that's like, in that case, it's not the means becoming the ends. Like I think the means are

06:49.200 --> 06:54.720
still the means and the ends are still the ends, right? Like when you look at it, people in ancient

06:54.720 --> 07:01.600
times, like you, there's no way to parade that you're someone who's, you know, someone who's

07:01.600 --> 07:05.360
thought about all of these things and someone who does all of these routines on the side,

07:05.360 --> 07:08.720
because they're actually operating things. Well, you can only embody it really. I mean,

07:08.720 --> 07:13.600
the only way to be a virtuous person is to embody it. Exactly.

07:13.600 --> 07:18.400
As in the surfer, people can vary. I mean, we all do this. I do this with philosophy, for instance.

07:19.120 --> 07:24.320
It's to use a term by Judith Butler, performativity. Be sure that, look at me, I'm doing all these

07:24.320 --> 07:32.400
things. I'm performing the role of what a self-help person would typically do, which is, yeah,

07:32.400 --> 07:38.320
productivity, meditation, all of this. But then that's, it's a bit unfair to say it's just something

07:38.320 --> 07:42.160
self-help people do. I think in postmodern, which is why I said it's a postmodern phenomena,

07:42.160 --> 07:48.320
in postmodern culture, everyone does that. We are all performing something. We are all putting

07:48.320 --> 07:54.480
on a performance, because we live in this kind of groundless existence. Our being has no...

07:55.520 --> 08:00.240
True. But I have one more point to make on the political side. Can I make that point? I'll let

08:00.240 --> 08:05.840
you go. Is that all right? Yeah, yeah, okay. Or do you want to respond, though, to the point?

08:05.840 --> 08:08.480
Actually, maybe I'll go first, because you probably take a while with that one, knowing you.

08:09.040 --> 08:13.840
Oh, no, no, no. This is actually... No, I think I already... Okay. To be honest, the existential

08:13.840 --> 08:17.360
point for me is the important one, because the political one, it's not just self-help.

08:17.360 --> 08:26.560
I think it's given our current milieu, ideology, and many things connect to this. But I would put

08:26.560 --> 08:34.240
it simply, I think self-help is also a conformist category, because it's this idea that this connects

08:34.240 --> 08:39.360
to the whole therapist and all the conversations we've been having before. The idea that I'll focus

08:39.360 --> 08:43.760
on myself, don't critique society, the Jordan Peterson thing, clean your room before you criticize

08:43.760 --> 08:49.680
the world, focus on myself, focus on improving, focus on my immediate life, getting my finances

08:49.680 --> 08:54.080
in order, getting my personal life, my personal, whatever health, wealth, whatever in order,

08:54.080 --> 08:59.920
spiritual life, whatever you may call it, and don't critique structures, don't be critical of

08:59.920 --> 09:07.440
neoliberalism, the capitalism, whatnot. So it's the moment one steps into the ideology of self-help,

09:07.440 --> 09:13.920
you already taken on many ideological... There's a lot of ideological baggage that comes along with

09:13.920 --> 09:18.960
it. It's not... So self-help certainly is not a political thing. It's not something that just

09:18.960 --> 09:23.600
exists, again, independently. This is within our culture. So which is why that... Again,

09:23.600 --> 09:29.040
the funny thing is that existentialist critique, I think it perfectly connects to the political

09:29.040 --> 09:36.400
critique, because the existential... Essentially, when you replace the means, when the means become

09:36.400 --> 09:42.400
the end, then there's no real end, right? Because it's a postmodern phenomena. The end of... Let's

09:42.400 --> 09:46.560
say, again, we want to create a more just society. We want to create a society where there are less

09:46.560 --> 09:50.160
people suffering, where we want to create a society where there's more love, let's say. We want to

09:50.160 --> 09:55.440
create a society which is perhaps a lot more like what Christ taught us. Now those things matter,

09:55.440 --> 10:00.080
because the end is already there. The end is engaging in the self-help things and not critique

10:00.080 --> 10:06.240
society. So then there's no... It's like this very kind of like... Yeah, it's a slave category.

10:06.240 --> 10:12.480
It's like this tepid existence where you never question society. You kind of live this zombie

10:12.480 --> 10:17.920
existence in many ways, which is really interesting, because if you look at people who are engaging

10:17.920 --> 10:22.400
self-help, you're right. They are rather obnoxious. You think that, man, they're people who are getting

10:22.400 --> 10:28.000
things done. They're so productive. But no, sometimes you should step back and question why

10:28.000 --> 10:33.600
you're doing what you're doing. Doing... Just do it the way Nike says it itself is a

10:33.600 --> 10:39.600
ideological imposition. It's an injunction. Do what? Do what? Do what, man? But that's why

10:39.600 --> 10:47.040
I think they're both... There are many existential drawbacks, but certainly there are many political

10:48.240 --> 10:51.600
drawbacks of self-help pissing, the ideology of self-help.
