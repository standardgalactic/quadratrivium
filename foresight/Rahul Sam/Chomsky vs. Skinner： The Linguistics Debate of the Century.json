{"text": " You said that it was, well, initially human nature or understanding human nature, but also reading Chomsky, which is clear from reading your work, your, I don't want to call you a Chomsky, and that's like a crass fear of putting it, but it seems like you're settling more on, let's say, Chomsky side over someone like BF Skinner. And so if I would, if you don't mind, I would love for you to sort of elucidate this ongoing, I don't want to call it a war, but debate between the Skinner side and Chomsky side. And in fact, in one podcast, you even said that this debate is still ongoing. It's not like it's Yeah, yeah, very much so. Nothing, nothing changes. Yeah, there's not a conclusion. This is the answer sort of thing, which is which is what's lovely about science in my view. So what's this debate in linguistics and cognitive science between Chomsky and Skinner? So that debate at the time was how to explain behavior and generally in linguistic behavior in particular, and Skinner was hoping to explain that in terms of properties of the information that's available to us, what's out there in the environment and responses and the links between them and associations that we formed between them. And basically, the idea is that to explain how we behave, which is all he cared about, all we need to do is look at the properties of what's out there rather than what the organism brings internally to that how the organism views the stimulus and how the organism chooses to response. And what Chomsky made very clear is that the study of behavior ought to start with the study of the organism, it's really kind of maybe you can think about it as a form of biology thinking about what is it that the organism brings with themselves to to this task. So to make it very, you know, very concrete. So why is it that, you know, you you understand a sentence, how is it, you know, that you have a sentence such as John is eager to please? How do you know that it's John? Who is being pleased? Being pleased? Whereas if you know, John is easy to please, then sorry, put it the other way around. So if John is easy to please, it is the one who is being pleased is John, whereas if John is eager to please, then he is pleasing Bill or somebody else, right? And what Chomsky made clear is that interpretations such like that, the only way to make sense of them is to figure out what is it that the person knows about language and how they encode information that's available to them. Any pointed out that our ability to do so to encode information that's available to us is constrained in part by innate principles of language that he called Universal Grammar. And would you say that's sort of something like innate knowledge that you write about in this book? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So as I read Chomsky, this is primarily a treatise on human nature and about innate knowledge, which he happened to advance in the domain of language. But I always read him as a philosopher, essentially. Certainly, yeah, I mean, he in fact, I believe he was the he chaired the Department of Philosophy at MIT, probably for a long time. So he has a really good background in philosophy certainly. I was professor so with the idea of Universal Grammar, I've always always been thinking about that idea like is is Universal Grammar itself, this type of innate knowledge? And is it something that that we can sort of study analytically? Oh, and empirically, empirically, beautiful. And I would say experimentally. Yeah, so. So all you need is to start with a good theory of what you think Universal Grammar is all about. And then go to the lab and try to figure out, do you have evidence for this thing? And it's not easy, but it's doable. I see, I see. So if we could play a bit of devil's advocate, because I've read, in fact, apart from Chomsky's political work, of course, I've read his book on language, which was which was an excellent read. And I found it quite hard to read as an ear five, to be totally honest. But I do know there are certain people still in the field, as you said, it's an ongoing debate that kind of are either critical or disagree with some of Chomsky's ideas, or let's say, values of Universal Grammar. So what are what are the current criticisms of this idea of innate knowledge or Universal Grammar? So to make it clear, I think that in fact, the majority of the field no longer thinks that no longer sides with Chomsky. I'm not totally convinced in my reading of the evidence that that's right. And that's the right conclusion. And the debate as a debates, as I see it in the domain of language, have always structured, or have always centered onto issues. One is, what is the machinery that you need to represent language? So what kind of representations that you have? And what, and what and do they are they structured? Are they structured in a systematic way? Do you need something that is akin to algebraic rules? Or all you have is basically associations, very rich set of associations, which apparently this is what GPT is doing, you know, AI is doing today. So A is what kind of representations do you have? And do you need explicit structure in your data, so to speak? The second question is, where these representations, and the rules, the way you operate over these representations, where is all this machinery coming from? And is it in parts specific to language? So are you born with some principles that are unique to language? And that's what allows you to acquire language? Or are you relying entirely on generic mechanisms that operate across domains? So what is your machinery? And how specific it is, where and where it's coming from? These are have always been the questions. And the debate these days are centered on a whether there are in fact algebraic rules. So this is huge debate about that, which has been increased and confounded by the rise of AI, because proponents of that state, like, look, you have the systems that seem to do just fine. And it's not clear. But some people, there is a question of whether they in fact have any algebraic representations at all. And the range of possibilities range between those who say, there aren't any structured representations in there at all, or that maybe they start without them, and they grow them somehow. And all this becomes really difficult to tell, just because there is so much data that these systems are exposed to that it's really hard. So one of the tests that you know, how do you know that there is an algebraic rules? One of the way to test it is to look at generalizations, can you generalize to items that are not similar to anything that you've seen before. But if you're basically your data set includes everything that we have, then it becomes very difficult to know whether you'd in fact generalize or not. So that makes the whole question of machinery very difficult to decide. Questions of innateness are difficult to decide for two reasons. A, the success of AI that kind of presents a big challenge. The other reason is oftentimes when you point out that there are universals across languages. So this is one of the main argument or an important argument to foreign aidness is to argue that, hey, we look at language after language, and they all show a certain property. So in my work, we looked at syllable structure and the fact that languages prefer structures such as blog to structures such as all bog, LBOG. That seems very clear. But the thing about this as well as many other preferences is that there is a correlation between what languages like to do and what the functional pressures of our body dictate. So if I ask my undergraduates why blog, then everybody tells me that what to say. And then intuitive theory behind it is that it's those functional pressures, meaning how is it is for you to say the constraints on your articulatory system and an audition that they're driving the force. And in every area of language universal, I don't in many areas of linguistic universals, you find such correspondences between what languages like to do and some functional explanation. Phonology is probably the area where you see those things most clearly. But nowadays, people are exploring those ideas elsewhere as well. And the problem is that when people find those correlations, they assume causation, meaning they if you find any functional explanation of what's going on, people kind of jump to the conclusion that it's this functional cause, or functional factor that is causing the structure that you see. So in this specific case, why do you prefer a blog? Because it's easy to say, or because it's easy to hear. That's what my undergraduates think. And so do professional scientists. And to me, it's not a done deal. To me, this is an empirical question that you need to go and explore as indeed we have. And there are ways to do so. So the fact that you find correlation in principle is ambiguous between two explanations. One is, it's not language, it's not your G, it's the functional system, the sensory and motor systems that are driving the cart here, that's what makes language the way it is. But the alternative possibility is, well, maybe it is abstract linguistic principles that are doing the driving, except for those principles are not entirely crazy, they're not entirely arbitrary, rather, they have evolved so that they optimize those sensory and motor pressures, which I don't think is super surprising. So that predicts that yes, you will find some correlation between you know, putative UG and those sensory and motor pressures, but not but what's doing the pushing was doing what's pushing the cart, so to speak, is UG rather than sensory motor system. And merely showing a correlation doesn't adjudicate between these possibilities. So in my work, we took it very seriously. So, for example, to figure out whether it's blog that's doing it, I'm sorry, whether the preference for blog is coming from, it's easier for you to say than in collaboration with my colleague, Alvaro Pascualeone, who is a neuroscientist who does transcarnial magnetic stimulation, what we did is zapped the motor system that controls the articulators, the leap specifically, and looked at what this is doing to your linguistic preferences. And conversely, what happens when you zap brokers area and what we found is a dissociation between them. So the point is, these are questions that you need to explore, you may or may like may not like the evidence that we produced, I think they're clear, but the my point is not to defend the solution, but rather to defend the method. I am very concerned about that time to jump from correlations to causation, I think this needs to be sorted out. And I think it's this disagreement that is behind a lot of the ambiguity that we're having in the field right now. April first, I did, in fact, read a blog post written on your work from your lab by Northeastern University. And so correct me if I'm wrong, in like a very elementary level, if I could put it this way, is it that you're at the moment claiming that it's as if these UG or these abstract principles, they aren't physical, they aren't arbitrary and random, but they've kind of evolved to suit our existence as home sapiens, the same way, let's say a physical limb or something has evolved. Exactly. Yeah, that's the working hypothesis. But again, I think for me, it's more important to tell people that just showing a correlation isn't necessarily proof, it's not a smoking gun of causation. It's more important for me to emphasize this methodological claim than to push my own interpretation of the data. So I think that there's, you know, there is probably a lot that need to be done, many more controls and to completely look at this question. And we have contributed some but by no means I would argue that we completely resolve the issue. What really bothers me is that the attempt to view the correlation and to jump to the conclusion that oh, we know what's going on. I think that's that's really unfortunate.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.32, "text": " You said that it was, well, initially human nature or", "tokens": [50364, 509, 848, 300, 309, 390, 11, 731, 11, 9105, 1952, 3687, 420, 50580], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19617641064547753, "compression_ratio": 1.6901960784313725, "no_speech_prob": 0.07226462662220001}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 4.32, "end": 8.48, "text": " understanding human nature, but also reading Chomsky, which is", "tokens": [50580, 3701, 1952, 3687, 11, 457, 611, 3760, 761, 4785, 4133, 11, 597, 307, 50788], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19617641064547753, "compression_ratio": 1.6901960784313725, "no_speech_prob": 0.07226462662220001}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 8.48, "end": 11.48, "text": " clear from reading your work, your, I don't want to call you a", "tokens": [50788, 1850, 490, 3760, 428, 589, 11, 428, 11, 286, 500, 380, 528, 281, 818, 291, 257, 50938], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19617641064547753, "compression_ratio": 1.6901960784313725, "no_speech_prob": 0.07226462662220001}, {"id": 3, "seek": 0, "start": 11.48, "end": 13.64, "text": " Chomsky, and that's like a crass fear of putting it, but it", "tokens": [50938, 761, 4785, 4133, 11, 293, 300, 311, 411, 257, 941, 640, 4240, 295, 3372, 309, 11, 457, 309, 51046], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19617641064547753, "compression_ratio": 1.6901960784313725, "no_speech_prob": 0.07226462662220001}, {"id": 4, "seek": 0, "start": 13.64, "end": 18.76, "text": " seems like you're settling more on, let's say, Chomsky side over", "tokens": [51046, 2544, 411, 291, 434, 33841, 544, 322, 11, 718, 311, 584, 11, 761, 4785, 4133, 1252, 670, 51302], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19617641064547753, "compression_ratio": 1.6901960784313725, "no_speech_prob": 0.07226462662220001}, {"id": 5, "seek": 0, "start": 18.76, "end": 23.18, "text": " someone like BF Skinner.
