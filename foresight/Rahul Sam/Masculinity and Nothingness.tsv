0	5680	Hey everyone, welcome to this reading of my essay, Masculinity and Nothingness.
5680	10480	So since the topic of masculinity has been on the news with the rise of controversial
10480	17520	figures like Andrew Tay, I decided to write this essay on masculinity from an existentialist
17520	24000	perspective, particularly inspired by the work of John Posatra and Martin Heidegger.
24000	28200	So without further ado, let's get started, Masculinity and Nothingness.
28200	31320	Do you become a man instead of being born one?
31320	37120	Because we have, for millennia, made moral, aesthetic, religious demands on the world,
37120	42880	looked upon it with blind desire, passion or fear, and abandoned ourselves to the bad
42880	45280	habits of illogical thinking.
45280	52440	This world has gradually become so marvelously variegated, frightful, meaningful, soulful.
52440	59800	It is a quiet color, but we have been the colorists, favorite nature, human or too human.
59800	65400	You are condemned to be a man, not because we live amidst a so-called masculinity crisis
65400	69040	where young men are purposeless and lost.
69040	71880	These are secondary concerns.
71880	77440	Instead it's because you're thrown into this world with circumstances you never chose.
77440	83840	You're born into a specific time, family, culture, gender and body that you never asked
83840	84840	for.
84840	91080	You have no idea why you are here, but still expected to follow arbitrary customs, social
91080	96120	conventions, with ties of kinship, duty and so on.
96120	102200	As the song Riders on the Storm goes, into this world we are thrown like a dog without
102200	104520	a bone.
104520	109720	If you momentarily pause and think of the uncanny nature of existence and your position
109720	116480	in an ostensibly meaningless universe where you nevertheless seek meaning, you discover
116480	119640	life is downright absurd.
119640	126160	Accordingly grasping this absurdity is a starting point to realizing that masculinity, as defined
126160	129400	by society, does not exist.
129400	137440	Therefore what Simone de Beauvoir said about women also applies to men albeit differently.
137440	142240	One is not born but rather becomes a woman, a second sex.
142240	148520	Respective of your biological sex, what you think of as a real man that is how you should
148520	155760	conduct yourself both socially and privately is a sociohistorical construct where you become
155760	158920	a man instead of being born one.
158920	164480	Since man lacks any masculine essence, you are free.
164480	169600	And man's freedom amongst his throneness is the actual crisis.
169600	176640	To understand throneness, a concept introduced by Martin Heidegger as Guofenheim, lets exemplify
176640	181600	using the body which inescapably constitutes one's being.
181600	187000	As Jean-Paul Sartre argued, you are a transcendent consciousness that allows you to transcend
187000	193880	a subjective body and experience freedom, a tearing away from oneself, a rashmaswa.
193880	199200	So perhaps you've had the bizarre experience one goes through in life, apropos one's body.
199200	204920	You may stand naked in front of a mirror and see that you, whatever you or I mean, Heidegger
204920	209360	calls it a Dasein, Dasein, their being.
209360	215120	Dasein's being is always at issue for it and its very being as having to take a stand
215120	219920	upon that issue by living its life in one way or another.
219920	223480	The Cambridge Heidegger lexicon.
223480	231000	Have a body that seems alien, which you may not even like and yet you as a self cannot
231000	233840	be in this world without it.
233840	239080	In fact, it's impossible to imagine what it's like to live without a body.
239080	245600	For a moment, leave aside the vain attributes, e.g. fatness, scrawniness, stretch marks,
245600	252160	pimples, etc. and look at your body phenomenologically as part of things themselves, meaning back
252160	257160	to the ways that things of the world are actually given an experience.
257160	263480	Then you realize, as elucidated by Maurice Molopointe, the body is something that's
263480	265920	a factical part of you.
265920	270840	It's endowed to you automatically as a brute fact of your existence.
270840	277040	Although at first glance your body looks like any other object in the world, if you keep
277040	283480	staring at that mirror, you'll realize this body of yours isn't merely a set of properties
283480	288200	and mechanisms, rather it's what allows you to exist.
288200	293080	In fact, when you act in the world by going for a walk, let's say, and duck a protruding
293200	299240	tree branch, you never experience the body as a thing utilized to duck that branch.
299240	304160	Instead, as you're engaged in the act, the body disappears, and your intentionality,
304160	308440	not to let that branch touch you, constitutes your experience.
308440	314400	Paradoxically, the disappearance of the body is what allows your intent to actualize.
314400	320240	The body also allows you to make sense of the world and how the broader ecological context
320240	322480	you're immersed within is structured.
322520	327720	Like in our example, that of an unpredictable environment where tree branches are jutting
327720	329360	out.
329360	334440	One ought to realize that the body isn't a mere vessel to carry our conscious experience
334440	339160	around the world, but rather it's a part of us innately.
339160	345680	Of course, such a prosaic experience doesn't necessarily lead to the aforementioned incongruity
345680	351800	of the body-feeling alien, as your body seems to be doing what it's supposed to do by following
351800	353440	your commands, so to speak.
353440	358960	Nonetheless, it's indicative of how you're thrown into your body, and that it isn't something
358960	365200	you can dispose of by uploading your consciousness to a computer or some such nonsense.
365200	370960	However, something saliently particular to the body you'll see on that mirror is your
370960	378560	penis, the phallic, fleshy, hairy bulge between your legs that St. Augustine says God gave
378560	384560	us as punishment for original sin, because as most men know, it doesn't work when you
384560	390000	want it to, think of a one-night stand, and works when you don't want it to, think of
390000	392960	a random erection in public.
392960	398360	Your penis is the quintessential indicator of the bizarreness of life, as it shows the
398360	404680	antagonism between your freedom as a conscious and transcendent human being, while also having
404680	414040	your existence physically embodied with biological drives such as an unfitted libido, in our case.
414040	419960	When wanting to duck that branch, your body follows your intentionality, but rarely does
419960	424440	a man control his sexual drives, or lack thereof.
424440	430880	As Haruki Murakami writes, the penis is a strange organ that has a mind of its own and
430880	437000	thinks thoughts not shared by my brain, Kafka on the show, and Augustine knows this best
437000	441600	because he really couldn't keep it in his pants back in the 4th century.
441600	448640	So your penis is illustrative of the real masculinity crisis, because it shows the paradox of existence.
448640	454880	Considering that, unlike objects, e.g. trees, chairs, iPhones, etc., that are being in the
454880	462440	world, onsua, a mode of existence that is static, unconscious, and simply is, you are
462440	469360	infinite freedom, a being for itself, posua, that is a conscious being aware of their own
469360	474840	consciousness, but is also incomplete, ambiguous, and non-determined.
474840	481280	This lacking of a predetermined essence forces man to create himself out of nothingness,
481280	486760	and man is nothing when the nothingness is primarily realized to us through negation,
486760	491480	that is, when a person's absence is accurately apprehended.
491480	497720	The most vivid example he, Sartre, provides to illustrate this pre-reflective negation
497720	501160	as the apprehension of Peir's absence from a café.
501160	505640	Sartre describes Peir's absence as pervading the whole café.
505640	510920	The café is cast in the metaphorical shade of Peir, not being there at the time he had
510920	512560	been expected.
512560	516680	This experience depends on human expectations, of course.
516680	522720	Sartre argues that if, by contrast, we imagine or reflect that someone else is not present,
522720	529920	say the Duke of Wellington, an elephant, etc., these abstract negative facts are not existentially
529920	534840	given in the same manner as our pre-reflective encounter with Peir's absence.
534840	539800	They're not given as an objective fact, as a component of the real.
539800	543960	Inomenologically speaking, the nothingness of Peir is a reality.
543960	550040	In your experience, his palpable lack is salient about everything else, in this hypothetical
550040	551040	café.
551040	555800	Therefore, it gives non-being an ontological place.
555800	561160	Everything that's already at being in the café, from the other patrons, baristas, waiters,
561160	569120	the furniture, etc., ceases to exist and your attention goes solely to the absence of Peir.
569120	574880	This pre-reflective negative apprehension penetrates you, but you don't directly intend
574880	581680	not to see Peir, but rather you dramatically encounter the non-being of Peir, or as Sartre
581680	586920	writes, Peir absent haunts this café, being a nothingness.
586920	593200	In that sense, the fact of your pre-reflective negation, apropos Peir, also applies to you
593200	598160	because let's say if Peir showed up and you were absent, then he would encounter your
598160	601920	non-being because you're a Dazain, much like him.
601920	608520	So what makes your being stand out is not any grounded positive affirmation, i.e. reputation,
608520	613200	personality, psychological type, and so on, but everything you're not.
613200	618920	The ambiguity of your existence, you are what you are, and you're not what you are, is the
618920	620920	Sartre and nothingness.
620920	626680	It imbues the tension between your being in itself and being for itself.
626680	633320	That is between you being a biological, psychological, and socio-historical creature, and your self-perception
633320	641800	as negating those observable or descriptive properties of your being in support of an aspirational
641800	647480	or ideal view of yourself that's learning, growing, philosophizing, etc.
647480	654240	In that vein, your starting point to being you is by declaring I am not that thing, which
654240	660680	perhaps is why your starting point to being a man is by declaring I reject masculinity.
660680	665120	For that reason, your nothingness condemns you to be free, because if you're nothing,
665120	671040	you only exist in this world qua infinite possibilities, presenting themselves to you.
671040	674800	Similar to standing on the edge of a cliff and knowing very well you have the freedom
674800	680720	to jump, nonetheless, you must choose from these possibilities every conscious moment
680720	681920	of your life.
682160	686640	Therefore, you're constantly recreating yourself through action by projecting yourself
686640	690800	onto the world, which is a task that leaves one perturbed.
690800	696880	Fegregarde describes as angst as the dizziness of freedom.
696880	699760	Your masculinity has no essential reality.
699760	706040	It doesn't objectively exist, and the existence of a man precedes the essence of his masculinity.
706040	712280	That said, your body, particularly the penis, is still a reminder that while you're completely
712280	718440	aware of your freedom, you nonetheless throne into a life of finitude that constrains this
718440	720600	freedom of your consciousness.
720600	725440	Though you're not trapped in it, thinking so is a piezolanumist response to life.
725440	730800	As Portillic writes, man is essentially finite freedom.
730800	735400	Freedom not in the sense of indeterminacy, but in the sense of being able to determine
735400	739560	himself through decision in the center of his being.
739560	746600	Man as finite freedom is free within the contingencies of his finitude, the courage to be.
746600	751320	The contradiction between freedom and throneness is irreconcilable.
751320	757240	Nor is it a mere duality one can be indifferent towards, but a fact of life to struggle with,
757240	758680	violently.
758680	766240	No synthesis between these conflicting truths lead to sublimated wholeness, or some higher
766240	767960	comforting truth.
767960	774680	Instead, the truth lies in the sheer antagonism itself, and it's this violent friction that
774680	782800	leads to what Gabriel Marcel calls the homoverto, the traveler, where man is never a destination,
782800	787360	but he is an unresolved contradictory and itenderant being.
787360	793320	We can never own anything, and we never truly settle anywhere, even if we stay in one place
793320	797840	all our lives, at the existentialist café.
797840	803400	Being thrown into the aforementioned paradox puts us in the unknown, and sometimes even
803400	804400	the uncanny.
804400	809760	Or specifically, for Marcel it leads to the mystery of existence.
809760	815880	One will never make sense of this mystery, yet it ought to be faced valiantly.
815880	821040	It isn't a mere speculative problem that's solvable a-personally at a distance, but it
821040	826640	becomes a mystery only because, above all, we are involved in the mystery as it's particular
826640	832880	to us and cannot be tackled by anybody at all, but rather it reveals itself for nobody
832880	836160	but me.
836160	842120	Facing everything delineated above requires courage, which a man should aspire to embody.
842120	847840	Paul Tillich writes on courage pertaining to anxiety stating, courage does not remove
847840	849240	anxiety.
849240	852880	Since anxiety is existential, it cannot be removed.
852880	857160	But courage takes the anxiety of non-being into itself.
857160	864160	Courage is self-affirmation, in spite of, namely, in spite of non-being.
864160	871480	He who acts courageously takes in his self-affirmation the anxiety of non-being upon himself, the
871480	874400	courage to be.
874400	880400	Similarly, your courage shouldn't remove the paradox and mystery of existence, but
880400	887320	take an opponent yourself assumed fully, and then you act in spite of and through it with
887320	893840	the awareness that only you can affirm yourself, only you can act in this particular instance.
893840	900360	Therefore, to do away with preconceived notions of masculinity is this supreme act of courage
900360	901600	for a man.
901600	907200	If you haven't experienced any of this phenomena illuminated above, you're distracting yourself
907200	908600	and being a coward.
908600	913480	If you're listening to misogynists like Andrew Tate, so-called men's podcasts like Fresh
913480	920680	and Fit, or even more positive figures like Jordan Peterson, you have no existential vitality,
920680	924680	no awareness of life, and your will to live is weakened.
925160	930680	Thereby, you refuse to take responsibility to face reality and have outsourced your living
930680	932680	to the other.
932680	937960	You have become a sheep refusing to think critically, you are a slave that needs a master
937960	940280	commanding you how to live.
940280	947680	Sathra calls such instances bad faith, mv svoa, denying our inherent freedom.
947680	953520	We know we're radically free, but we repudiate the responsibility of their freedom by conforming
953520	954840	to the other.
954840	961080	In our case, that's masculinity, or what a real man should be, similar to how a Parisian
961080	963600	waiter plays a performative role.
963600	966800	Let us consider this waiter in the café.
966800	971520	His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid.
971520	974880	He comes towards the patrons with a step, a little too quick.
974880	977360	He bends forward a little too eagerly.
977360	982680	His voice, his eyes express an interest, a little too solicitous for the order of the
982680	983840	customer.
983840	987400	All his behavior seems to us a gain.
987400	993200	He applies himself to training his movements as if they were mechanisms, the one regulating
993200	994200	the other.
994200	998280	His gestures and even his voice seem to be mechanisms.
998280	1002600	He gives himself the quickness and pettiless rapidity of things.
1002600	1003720	He is plain.
1003720	1005560	He is amusing himself.
1005560	1007760	But what is he playing?
1007760	1011440	We need not watch long before we can explain it.
1011440	1015000	He is playing at being a waiter in a café.
1015000	1022160	There are indeed many precautions to impress a man in what he is, as if we lived in perpetual
1022160	1029760	fear, that he might escape from it, that he might break away and suddenly elude his condition,
1029760	1031760	being a nothingness.
1031760	1036320	This is no different to the performative role a businessman trying to sell you financial
1036320	1038160	freedom plays.
1038160	1044560	He speaks and dresses a certain way and asks questions not to understand or engage in dialogue,
1044560	1050360	but to sustain his performance of being a competent and astute person.
1050360	1055000	Much like the waiter, every action by the businessman is contrived.
1055000	1059640	He follows a prefabricated narrative given to him by society.
1059640	1064080	He is an actor following a script, performing for the public.
1064080	1069160	Of course, being a man is also a performance you put on.
1069160	1074120	That said, bad faith isn't about lies, self-deception or inauthenticity.
1074120	1077800	As intimated in this essay, you don't have an authentic self.
1077800	1080600	So there's no use trying to be your true self.
1080600	1084520	And concomitantly, you cannot deceive a self that doesn't exist.
1084520	1091640	Satra also doesn't believe one can escape bad faith entirely, because it's omnipresent.
1091640	1097920	And we all inescapably play a role, as Shakespeare writes, all the worlds a stage, and all men
1097920	1102320	and women merely players, as you like it.
1102320	1108000	Does this mean you're in a hopeless situation where you'll always be a puppet of society?
1108000	1109000	Yes.
1109280	1115320	And given you're free, in typical Camusian fashion, you can still choose to embrace the
1115320	1121080	absurdity of your existence and find courage in hopelessness.
1121080	1126360	While you will succumb to bad faith, you can fight your cowardly demise for eternity.
1126360	1132560	You can orient yourself towards courage, taking radical responsibility and refusing to take
1132560	1135640	comfort in false masculinity.
1135640	1142960	You can create your subjective ideal of what being a man entails that solely appeases you
1142960	1143960	alone.
1143960	1150760	Indeed, it's unsurprising that Satra ends his magnum opus by writing, Man is a useless
1150760	1153840	passion, being a nothingness.
1153840	1160320	But perhaps his life showed that he tried to make himself worthy of his condition, and
1160320	1161320	so should you.
1161640	1166680	But on your own account, after all, Satra is just another dead philosopher.
1166680	1172080	Whatever the case may be, this is the reality you're born into, so do with it as you may.
1172080	1177120	Frankly, I choose courage, because all the ideals expounded by the phenomenologists and
1177120	1183160	existentialists I tackled in this essay make life the ultimate adventure worth living for,
1183160	1185680	if one doesn't shy away from them.
1186640	1188360	Coda.
1188360	1192760	The themes of exploding this essay certainly aren't specific to men.
1192760	1195680	If you're human, they apply to you, bar none.
1195680	1201560	However, I've intentionally used a language that'll direct this essay towards men, who
1201560	1207200	are told they're in a crisis in the current socio-cultural and historical position.
1207200	1212720	Therefore, this crisis ought to be aptly named the human crisis instead of the masculine
1212720	1218880	adjective, although that would generalize the situation all too much, making it an abstract
1218880	1222000	theory which the existentialists would detest.
1222000	1229400	In any case, replacing the terms man and masculine with woman and feminine, respectively, wouldn't
1229400	1231880	change the underlying message of this piece.
