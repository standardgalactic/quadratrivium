0	1720	And that really, this is the question
1720	4880	that I want to start off with at a high level.
4880	7600	The reason being, I've realized if anyone's
7600	10600	going to ask for me from now onwards,
10600	12040	what is philosophy of science?
12040	14360	Or can I have a bit of a brief introduction?
14360	16960	I just tell them to read chapter one of the Knowledge
16960	19760	Machine, because one of my favorite chapters
19760	24160	where you go through the history of, well, really,
24160	29760	20th century science, and this great method debate.
29800	31080	So I'd love for you to, Michael,
31080	34480	maybe like expand and lay down.
34480	37240	We've probably done this many times in previous broadcasts,
37240	40280	so I apologize if I got to repeat yourself.
40280	45480	The debate between Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn
45480	49400	and what's this ongoing great method debate
49400	51800	in the philosophy of science.
51800	57000	You know, I think it all began when a lot of intellectuals
57000	60200	in the 20th century were looking at the mess
60200	67840	that the human race had made of, or at least the kind of the
67840	71360	European part of the human race had made of the world.
71360	74920	And this is actually particularly
74920	79160	after the First World War, that's why I'm emphasizing Europe.
79160	81480	And decided that what they need to do
81480	85600	is to rebuild everything on rational principles.
85600	90400	And at that time, that really meant scientific principles
90400	91320	for them.
91320	96080	And so this question came out, what are scientific principles?
96080	99080	What is it to go about, for example,
99080	101520	constituting a state scientifically
101520	104440	or drawing up a moral code scientifically?
104440	106520	And those are deep, complicated questions
106520	110680	that I don't have answers to and I wasn't writing about in my book.
110680	115040	But of course, it turned all of these philosophers
115040	116200	into philosophers of science.
116200	119280	They had to say, here is the right way
119280	121640	to go about gaining knowledge, the scientific way,
121640	122840	as opposed to the other way.
122840	126520	So they wanted to be able to write down, in effect,
126520	131040	some rules for inquiry, not necessarily
131040	133760	a complete guide to inquiry, but some kind of set of rules
133760	137320	that was distinctive enough to separate science
137320	138200	from all the rest.
138200	140680	And what I call the great method debate
140680	143320	begins there with the attempt to say
143320	148720	what the scientific method is in a way that differentiates it
148720	152040	from all other forms of inquiry.
152040	156240	And after the early difficulties in doing that,
156240	158800	that turned into a big debate about whether there even
158800	160480	was a scientific method.
160480	165040	And you can see one way to look at Papa's and Coon's work
165040	167920	is this, that Papa was someone who thought he knew
167920	169200	what the scientific method was.
169200	171440	And he is a paradigm of one of these thinkers
171440	175680	who wanted to make the world scientific.
175680	178360	And he did write on politics as much as he did on science.
178360	180240	But anyway, so he's someone who believes
180240	182640	there's a scientific method, and he can tell you what it is,
182640	186600	and that the right sort of critical rational scientific mind
186600	188960	is the one that applies this method.
188960	192680	Probably more than anyone else in the history of,
192680	195280	at least in the history of 20th century philosophy
195280	198000	of science, Thomas Coon is identified
198000	200960	as someone who undercut Papa's project.
200960	205520	But Coon is not a negative philosophy.
205520	208440	He has his own actually quite sophisticated story
208440	209680	about how science works.
209680	215120	But it's really deeply different from the standard method
215120	215620	story.
215620	218320	And in fact, it's a story in which
218320	219880	scientists don't come out looking
219880	222520	like these kind of critical rationalists,
222520	224160	but something rather different.
224160	226640	And of course, we can talk a little bit more
226640	229080	about that in a moment, but rather than diving into it,
229080	230840	I just really want to stress this contrast
230840	233800	between, on the one hand, this single scientific method
233800	238000	that's the epitome of critical inquiry with Papa.
238000	239800	And then with Coon, you have there's
239800	242760	a distinctive social organization in science.
242760	245840	But it actually involves many different methods
245840	249040	at different times, so there's not one unchanging method.
249040	254120	And furthermore, that setup is almost, you might say,
254120	256600	well, if not irrationalist, then there's
256600	261520	many elements to it that seem quite at odds with Papa's
261520	264080	very heroic view of scientific inquiry
264080	268920	as I say, the apex of rationality.
268920	271320	Yeah, I mean, after all, Papa was also
271320	273040	a political philosopher, right?
273040	275760	I mean, I've read his book, The Open Society,
275760	279440	and it's enemies of, anyway, the book on totalitarianism.
279440	283120	And he even calls Plato the person who
283120	286120	started all of totalitarianism.
286240	288520	It's quite interesting.
288520	292840	So Professor Streamins, if you could start with Papa,
292840	296000	and then, of course, the unfortifiability principle.
296000	298080	Now, anyone could, I don't think it's that hard,
298080	299920	even for a layperson like myself,
299920	302360	to just Google what it means and get
302360	304280	a very elementary understanding.
304280	306320	So perhaps you could firstly just explain
306320	311880	what the Karl Popperian unfortifiability principle is.
311880	315920	But then also, as you've done in the book, rather well,
315960	317960	maybe lay down some of your criticisms,
317960	321880	criticisms of it just for the audience.
321880	322640	Yeah, sure.
322640	325920	So Papa thought that really the heart of the scientific method
325920	329480	was this very simple idea that if a theory makes
329480	333440	a false prediction, it has to be wrong somehow.
333440	337760	And Papa thought that at the core of the scientific inquiry
337760	341760	was the systematic elimination of all of the false theories.
341760	344640	And notionally, of course, you could imagine one day
344640	346360	having eliminated them all and just having
346360	349560	one true theory remaining, although as Papa
349560	352440	was understood as well as anyone,
352440	355160	that was not a realistic prospect.
355160	356720	But he thought we could at least think of ourselves
356720	359960	as making progress by eliminating the false theories.
359960	362200	So the thing that makes that, oh, go ahead.
362200	363880	No, I was just going to ask, please continue.
363880	366280	I'm not going to follow up on that, but keep going, yeah.
366280	368440	OK, so the thing that makes that, though,
368440	372280	now turning to where he begins to run into difficulties.
372280	375600	And he had plenty of things to say about these difficulties,
375600	379680	not as if this is some sort of one-shot undermining
379680	380200	in his view.
380200	385320	But it's really difficult when a theory does
385320	386920	make a false prediction to figure out
386920	389920	whether it was really the theory's fault or not.
389920	392840	Science is such a complicated thing.
392840	397160	And in particular, the kinds of measurement apparatus
397160	400840	that are used to make observations in cutting-edge science
400840	404760	are often very complicated, fragile things that only
404760	408760	work when conditions are exactly right.
408760	412560	99.9% of the time, when you get a false prediction,
412560	414520	it's not really the theory's fault at all.
414520	416560	It's just that something went wrong with apparatus.
416560	418800	Or maybe you made a false assumption
418800	420520	when you were making your calculations.
420520	423240	Or maybe even, and this does happen,
423240	425040	there's an error in the software that you're
425040	426640	using to analyze your results.
426640	428560	And so it's not really the theory's fault or not,
428560	431080	and it would be a terrible mistake to throw away the theory
431080	433720	just because you got this false prediction.
433720	438760	So if you're going to capture the spirit of Papa's proposal,
438760	444240	you have to figure out some way of deciding when it's OK
444240	446880	to just say, oh, something went wrong with the apparatus.
446880	450760	And when you should say, Arno, this time it's the theory's fault.
450760	453080	And so we've falsified the theory, as he says.
453080	454880	We can throw away the theory.
454880	456280	Sometimes, of course, you can just
456320	458800	see that something went wrong with the apparatus.
458800	461720	Like, you know, it's smoking, making,
461720	463160	attracting.
463160	467400	But often, in many cases in the history of science,
467400	469640	we have results that were anomalous and looked
469640	471120	like they cross problems with theories.
471120	473160	And we will never know what went wrong,
473160	477640	because it's just too late to go back and check.
477640	480120	I'm sure we'll probably end up talking about some examples
480120	480620	later on.
480620	488100	But this Papa really never fully satisfactorily
488100	493260	answered this question of when it's OK to blame the apparatus
493260	496740	or other assumptions and when you should blame the theory.
496740	500020	I think he had an interesting substantive things to say,
500020	504140	but he didn't succeed in writing down what he was really
504140	508020	after, which was a kind of a systematic calculus,
508020	510700	if you like, for making these decisions.
510700	512660	Something that took these decisions out
512660	515820	of the hands of scientists who might be indulging
515820	517220	in motivated reasoning, you know,
517220	519820	trying to see their own theory in a good light
519820	522100	and just sort of said, no, you must follow this logic.
522100	525500	And this logic says your theory is wrong.
525500	527980	Yeah, because I haven't read his book,
527980	529940	where he introduced a principle, what's
529940	531860	it called, the logic of science, I believe.
531860	534860	But I don't think of scientific discovery, that's it.
534860	537740	Yeah, I haven't read that book, although my understanding,
537740	539140	again, at a very elementary level,
539140	542060	is that it seems that Papa really
542060	546420	wanted some kind of a priori principle or even theory
546420	550060	of science that allows scientists to do science.
550060	553740	And then what you would argue for, and many others,
553740	555620	would be that, oh, well, unfortunately,
555620	559060	for better or worse, let's say, we haven't found that.
559060	559900	Yeah.
559900	561940	And so what you, in fact, have is, you know,
561940	564500	I kind of made it all sound more like a philosophical argument.
564500	566780	But the fact of science, as you have real arguments
566780	570940	over these things, should whether probably
570940	574900	the result is just an artifact of some problem
574900	576980	with the measuring apparatus or the theory really
576980	577700	is in trouble.
577700	581940	In fact, that's almost more normal than any other state
581940	582440	of affairs.
582440	586860	So some typically scientists who perform the experiment
586860	589820	will trust the apparatus more than the scientists
589820	592940	sort of a few labs over who weren't there to kind of see
592940	594620	it all operating and so on.
594620	597820	And, you know, in the end, if scientists
597820	598940	keep going for long enough, there
598940	602220	does seem to be a kind of a consensus that forms.
602220	604060	The experiments get done enough times,
604060	606060	they're enough different people.
606060	608740	It's not as if we're just totally at sea,
608740	613900	but it doesn't have this simple, crisp, objective,
613900	619460	algorithmic feel to it that Papa was really reaching for.
619460	620420	Yeah, yeah.
620420	623420	Well, I guess that leads us to, I don't know if I should call
623420	625980	it the antithesis, but at least let's say,
625980	629900	well, juxtapose Thomas Kuhn's theory, the paradigm shift,
629900	635180	the term that he popularized, with the Popperian principle.
635180	637740	Yeah, so the structures of scientific revolutions,
637740	641060	perhaps my favorite book on philosophy of science,
641060	644460	yours is a healthy contender.
644460	650580	And so in contrast to Karl Popper, Professor Ravens,
650580	651940	how does Thomas Kuhn differ?
651940	655380	Because he came after Popper, isn't that right, Sam?
655380	656860	And what were his ideas?
656860	657540	Yeah.
657540	661540	So Papa wrote his book in the 1930s,
661540	664380	and Kuhn wrote his book in the 1960s to give you some sense.
664380	667580	So Popper is, in a way, essentially into war,
667580	672220	I suppose we would now say, and Kuhn is very much post-war.
672220	675260	And Popper was still firing on all cylinders by then,
675260	679900	but he wasn't presenting whole new ideas.
679940	684140	Well, he was entitled to have a break.
684140	687020	So Kuhn's idea is actually, it doesn't dispense
687020	688540	with the idea of a scientific method,
688540	690820	as I was saying earlier, but rather the idea
690820	695140	is that at any particular time period,
695140	700420	a science, say like particle physics or molecular genetics
700420	703500	or economics, maybe microeconomics,
703500	707260	will have a particular method, a particular set of rules
707260	709780	for doing science, and actually a rather comprehensive set
709820	712420	of rules for doing science.
712420	716900	But that these methods are not fixed for all time.
716900	720060	In fact, they change from time to time
720060	724100	in dramatic episodes called scientific revolutions,
724100	728060	or the phrase that Kuhn famously popularized for this
728060	729860	is our paradigm shift.
729860	731140	And the thing, the paradigm here,
731140	734460	is this kind of big method for doing science.
734460	738300	And when it shifts, that means the old paradigm
738300	742580	has crumbled, and a new one comes along and replaces it.
742580	745580	So whereas Papa and the sort of classic,
745580	747820	the classic searches for a scientific method,
747820	750980	we're looking for a single rule that is valid for all time.
750980	753460	As you said, hopefully our priority,
753460	758460	one that we can just know is right without, with certainty.
760060	764420	Kuhn thought these methods only last for a while,
764420	766780	and then their scientists actually pushed them
766780	769620	to the point where all of their flaws are exposed,
769620	771420	because they're actually, they're very rich,
771420	772820	but they're also kind of limited.
772820	774340	They have a lot of assumptions built in,
774340	776100	and inevitably some of those assumptions
776100	777700	will turn out to be wrong.
777700	781260	And so scientists pushed them to their breaking point.
781260	785020	And in effect, they destroy their own methods
785860	789300	by exposing the faulty assumptions or whatever.
789300	791180	And then some new method has to come along
791180	793020	and supplant the old method.
793020	796020	A new paradigm comes along and supplants the old paradigm.
796020	797060	That's a paradigm shift.
797060	798340	That's a scientific revolution.
798340	802500	Then you have a whole new methodological complex
802500	804060	governing what scientists do
804060	807060	in whatever area of science it is.
808060	812180	So in this way of paradigm shifting, would it be,
812180	814460	because it's not fair to say like, for instance,
814460	817660	from the Newtonian worldview of classical mechanics,
817660	821500	I'd say, to now with quantum theory, quantum mechanics,
821500	824020	is that really a paradigm shift,
824020	827340	or is a paradigm shift something where we have an epochal,
827340	831140	something like from Aristotelian science or physics
831140	832460	to what we have in modern science?
832460	834300	Because the reality is we still,
834300	836740	despite living now in the paradigm,
836740	840180	let's say, of quantum theory and quantum mechanics,
840180	843700	we still subscribe to certain Newtonian principles,
843700	844540	for sure, right?
844540	846580	And it's not like we've completely dismissed that.
847820	851060	So how did, yeah, perhaps maybe flesh out a bit more
851060	852940	what really is a paradigm shift.
854140	859140	Yeah, well, I think that the change that is most central
861900	865020	and to a paradigm shift, although it's not the only change,
865020	868460	is a change in a kind of a whole theoretical conception
868460	870580	of how the world works.
870580	874140	So although on the superficially quantum mechanics
874140	877620	or equally Einstein's general theory of relativity,
877620	879980	so that the kind of the successor theory
879980	882620	to Newton's work on gravitation in particular,
882620	887620	although that preserves a lot of what Newton said
887700	890380	in the sense of making the same predictions,
890380	893100	the theoretical underpinnings look really different.
894220	896220	So I'll do it with gravity.
897140	900860	In Newton, there's this force that objects
900860	904020	with mass exert on one another, they pull one another,
904020	907900	and that's gravity and it causes them to accelerate
907900	912260	and has spelled out by Newton's second law.
912260	915140	But in Einstein's theory that replaced Newton's theory,
915140	918300	there's no force directly between objects like that.
918300	923300	Instead, objects impart this twist or curvature to space-time,
924540	927380	and then other objects are trying to travel
927380	929340	through that space-time, but because it's twisty,
929340	932260	they themselves take a curvy path,
932260	935140	which is just the path of, say, a body like the Earth
935140	936940	or between the sun.
936940	939460	Anyway, I probably shouldn't try to explain general,
940060	942620	I'd rather hear you put it, but the point is it's a really,
942620	946260	it's even though it makes a lot of the same predictions
946260	948700	as Newton's theory, which it had better do
948700	952140	because Newton's theory made so many correct predictions,
952140	953940	it's a really different way of thinking
953940	958300	about what's going on, and that's kind of at the core
958300	961220	of what makes it a new paradigm.
961220	964980	But it also suggests all of these new experiments
964980	968340	that just wouldn't make sense in Newton's theory.
968340	973300	So an example of that would be looking for the existence
973300	976660	of gravitational waves, Einstein's theory predicts,
976660	980580	because mass actually has an impact on space-time itself.
980580	985300	When you have, especially very dramatic events
985300	987260	like two colliding black holes,
987260	990740	where actually cause space-time itself to shiver,
990740	992820	like throwing a rock into a pool,
992820	995100	you get these waves that ripple outwards.
996100	998300	So you should be able to detect those
998300	1000420	if you build a sensitive enough apparatus,
1000420	1003780	which physicists finally succeeded in doing
1003780	1006180	in about eight years ago.
1006180	1008020	I mean, they've been building it for about 50 years,
1008020	1011260	but it finally detected gravitational waves in 2015.
1011260	1012940	So you get all of these new ideas
1012940	1014700	about what you might do with science,
1014700	1016940	and that's characteristic of a paradigm shift.
1016940	1019460	It's not just a set of new theoretical ideas,
1019460	1022620	but all of these new ideas for actually doing science,
1022620	1024580	new kinds of experiments or observations
1024660	1025660	you could perform.
1027380	1031940	So that's what makes that shift from,
1031940	1033300	oh, you mentioned quantum mechanics,
1033300	1037180	and I kind of subtly changed the example just to gravity,
1037180	1039020	because it's, I think, a bit more straightforward.
1039020	1041540	Yeah, the question stands, yeah.
1041540	1046300	But the idea is it's the new paradigm managers
1046300	1048620	to do on the surface superficially
1048620	1051060	in terms of prediction and so on,
1051060	1052860	a lot of what the old paradigm did,
1052860	1054620	but it gives you a whole new picture
1054620	1056140	of the way the universe is working
1056140	1059500	that makes sense of those predictions.
1059500	1061340	Yeah, in fact.
1061340	1062980	Your method for doing science suggests
1062980	1065780	all of these new experiments you might do and so on.
1065780	1069260	Yeah, I was thinking of more of a contemporary example of this,
1069260	1073100	and I realized, I'm reading this book also by Tim Modellin,
1073100	1077420	the philosopher of science on quantum non-locality,
1077420	1080980	and there's an interesting kind of story of Einstein,
1080980	1086700	because John Bell, he mathematically proved quantum non-locality,
1086700	1089540	I believe in the 80s or 90s,
1089540	1092260	and then Tim Modellin, he's like one of his,
1092260	1093620	John Bell is like one of his heroes,
1093620	1096940	and then I believe in the Nobel Prize in Physics
1096940	1099580	was awarded to the laureates
1099580	1103460	who proved quantum non-locality,
1103460	1106340	it's mouthful, experimentally,
1106340	1108940	and then in the book he talks about how Einstein
1108940	1112460	didn't want to accept this idea of non-locality
1112460	1114460	because his theory was in fact local,
1114460	1118380	and he called it a spooky action at a distance,
1118380	1120660	but then of course now that we have mathematical proof
1120660	1123500	and empirical evidence, let's say,
1123500	1127260	which kind of sticks to your own rule of explanation,
1127260	1129500	it seems like we're kind of going through that paradigm shift
1129500	1132260	where, well, I guess physics isn't local anymore
1132260	1133860	in the way we thought,
1133860	1136860	and I find that endlessly fascinating
1136860	1140220	how it just completely shifts not only our theories,
1140220	1142540	but just even at a very essential level
1142540	1145900	how we view the world and experience the world.
1145900	1148100	Yeah, that's a great example of, again,
1148100	1150860	of a paradigm shift where you get this new kind of
1150860	1154180	fundamental, theoretical apparatus of quantum mechanics,
1154180	1156780	and that makes these weird predictions about non-locality,
1156780	1158260	and so it suggests this,
1158260	1160220	all of these scientific experiments you might do
1160220	1162860	that wouldn't have made any sense in Newtonian physics,
1162860	1165660	and in particular those Nobel Prize winning experiments
1165660	1168420	that really established that the predictions
1168420	1170820	of the theory really were accurate.
