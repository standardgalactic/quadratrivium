00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the interval and podcast and

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,200
today I'm gonna read out guiding axiom number five which is a part of this sub

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,160
series that I've been doing where I've been reading out these axioms that I

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,960
wrote for my newsletter the unhappy man links down below in the description and

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,000
as I was writing down these axioms I realized I'm in fact setting up a

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,760
framework for sounds like someone just got shot outside that's fine we don't

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,520
live in America this is really a people don't get shot here

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,960
came back to it when I was laying down these axioms I realized that oh yeah

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,000
this is a framework for all of my creative work if it only makes sense to

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,640
read them out in this podcast given that this podcast is a part of my creative

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,760
work I'm sorry if that sounds pretentious and also it allows me to have a

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,360
bit of structured thinking and writing I think is the best way to do that today's

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,880
axiom axiom number five is undoubtedly my favorite one it's never fallen love

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,920
with your suffering or well I said never fall in love with suffering as a

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,360
category and the reason it's important for me is because from all the axioms

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,200
I've laid down in many ways these axioms are an antidote to my flaws or things

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,480
that I see are shortcomings in my character be it morally spiritually

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,160
existentially whatever you want to call it and that's why I'm writing down

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,320
these axioms so that I don't let these shortcomings in my character of who am

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,720
as a person impact the work I do and falling in love with suffering my god

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,840
I am I'm kind of ashamed how how vain it is when I really understood this

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,840
concept thanks a lot to Slavoj Zizek I think it's reading his stuff and

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,360
listening to his lectures that really influenced me as to why it's a bad idea

24
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,280
to fall in love with suffering and most of us subconsciously or unconsciously do

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,440
this therefore it's it's important to be cognizant of this phenomena without

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,240
further ado enough of a prelude let's get to the axiom so yes as I said it's

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:21,080
the unhappy man guiding axiom number five never fall in love with suffering and

28
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,600
of course I've got this painting by Goya this is an interesting one of cryos

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,200
crucified this is before I think he went through his face of depression but of

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,480
course suffering is very much connected to the archetypal story of the western

31
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,080
collective unconscious let's say of the crucifixion that's why I decided to

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,160
pick this any kirkard guardian is familiar with the captivating admission

33
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,200
in either or my melancholy is the most faithful mistress I have known what

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,680
wonder then that I love her in return most of us of the existentialist elk

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,680
have fully bought into the dogma of the depressed yet perspicacious philosopher

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,040
for us all great truths lack profundity if not written in a shopenhari and

37
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,280
pessimism about our condition the misery of existence is what those with great

38
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,320
intelligence and deep hearts have come to see to not see this verity is nothing

39
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,400
but naivety at least this is the bullshit we tell ourselves to be depressed or

40
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,400
suffer needlessly as far from the romantic beauty we give to it none of it

41
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,600
makes one so deeper and inspires philosophically penetrating poetry or

42
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,360
the staff skin literature in fact when I read my nonsensical journaling written

43
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,920
during the low points I see it as nothing but vain egotistical pabula which

44
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,880
is why I stopped journaling it's a waste of time and better drinking away your

45
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:08,200
sorrows this is a joke for them but beyond a stentatious vanity we all dwell

46
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,960
with our misery purely to feel something we often deliberately seek

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,360
pathological relationships only because the melodramatic pain of love reminds

48
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,600
us of our humanness better to feel pain than nothing at all

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:32,080
OS Dostoevsky wrote if he human beings does not find means he will contrive

50
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,320
destruction and chaos will contrive suffering of all sorts only to gain

51
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,200
his point notes from underground and of course being willing to suffer through

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,760
love particularly romantic tells us of our goodness of our higher virtues in

53
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,520
being authentically self-sacrificial for another such as why Nietzsche wrote

54
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,320
ultimately it is a desire not the desire that we love your granival I must

55
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,600
admit that I am ashamed of how pathetic we are as a species having said that I

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,000
see why modern people lust after suffering as they are given the

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,960
impossible choice of contrived pseudo happiness in the form of new age self

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,680
help which you all know is rife with empty patitudes I bullshit and the

59
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,040
finger wagging pull yourself up by your bootstraps heartless American stoicism

60
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:36,720
it seems that we're stuck in this binary the modern age is an era of nihilism so

61
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,280
as Nietzsche the man who explored the symptom to his ultimate road read from

62
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,800
a distant planet the majestical script of our earthly existence would perhaps

63
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,000
seduce the reader to the conclusion that the earth was the aesthetic planet

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,080
parks alone an outposts of discontented arrogant and nasty creatures who

65
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,400
harbored a deep disgust for themselves for the world for all life and hurt

66
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,400
themselves as much as possible out of pleasure in hurting probably their only

67
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,320
pleasure the passage above is from a skating critique of the aesthetic ideal

68
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,760
the mode of life he pillories has little to do with religious asceticism but

69
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:25,080
say but rather a cultural zeitgeist despite the characteristic phenomenon

70
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,360
being cross cultural for instance he would be as equally contemptuous of the

71
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,600
contemporary postmodern stoicism of the ryan holy types or neoliberal western

72
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,240
buddhism that turns a blind eye to the problems of the world and decides to

73
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,440
inflict suffering on oneself for the pleasure of it ie cold showers fasting

74
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,880
crossfit etc irrespective of religious connotations all such modes of being

75
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,280
manifest a drive towards the ascetic ideal so his sentiments are apt to any

76
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,160
pseudo suffering we create purely to inject artificial meaning into our barren

77
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,640
desolate veins whether in the form of modern self-help cults with their

78
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,320
unending self-flagellation or a morbid romantic relationship that's conspicuously

79
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:21,560
making everyone suffer we desire meaning perhaps the intrinsic human reality is

80
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,920
meaninglessness and the incompleteness of life therefore we ought to be cognizant

81
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,200
of how we respond to our predicament and one can only live authentically once

82
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,880
his datum is confronted in my view the only true antidote to meaninglessness

83
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,040
or nihilism of our culture is love but that's a whole other essay or book

84
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,840
listen on suffering on suffering as a psychological phenomenon i find affinity

85
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,160
with the zhezhekyan sentiments on the matter footnote influenced by zhak lakon's concept of

86
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,840
joystones and the Freudian death drive zhezhek made the following point in in his books and

87
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,400
lectures paraphrasing don't fall in love with your suffering never presume that your suffering is

88
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:14,120
in itself proof of your authenticity renunciation of pleasure can easily turn into pleasure of

89
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,600
renunciation itself back to the essay pleasure never satiates us as there's only so much of it

90
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,760
one can enjoy therefore we seek the pleasure beyond pleasure and willfully suffer for an

91
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:34,440
ostensibly noble course but in reality this is our yearning to fill the void in life we hope to

92
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,520
overcome the abyss with a deeper spiritual meaning sometimes with a touch of romanticism as we see

93
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:48,600
in fascism that's elusive for us in the technological age footnote read the question concerning

94
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,920
technology essay by martin heidegger to understand what this age entails when i mean this age i mean

95
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,040
the current age we live in or the technological age to be more specific i'll read that again that's

96
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,120
elusive for us in the technological age where to test have skis this may man has become nothing

97
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:14,120
but a piano key martyrdom for instance typifies his drive within us despite the words of tomology

98
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,920
a martyr is not a purely religious individual or some fundamentalist fanatic to a certain extent

99
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,400
everyone sees themselves as a martyr from a self-sacrificial parent and a serious employee

100
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,560
working 15 hours a day at a trendy postmodern startup to a nurse working in palliative care

101
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,480
to the martin us the pain of sacrifice and duty gives us that pleasure when the so-called

102
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,880
worldly pleasures generally a derided term but it shouldn't be are inadequate footnote

103
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,000
pleasure which could be misunderstood by how it's colloquially used in the carnal hedonic sense

104
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,080
may not be the aptus term for this instance but i've decided to stick with it since i'm speaking

105
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,920
in Freudian nomenclature i'll reread that sentence because i feel jumping to the footnotes tend to

106
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,760
break the flow of things but i kind of have to read out the footnotes because they are related

107
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,120
to what i'm writing to the martyr in us the pain of sacrifice and duty gives us that pleasure

108
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,120
when the so-called worldly pleasures generally a derided term but it shouldn't be are inadequate

109
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,560
or as G. K. Chesterton wrote pessimism is not in being tired of evil but in being tired of good

110
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,920
despair does not lie in being wary of suffering but in being wary of joy the everlasting man

111
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,400
of course none of this implies we shouldn't take upon actual responsibility in life and

112
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,560
carry the world's burdens nor does it mean above all that love is free of a sword and fire

113
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,760
Alan Burjou observed this is in his book in praise of love by the way it's a great little book

114
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,960
that i've been recommending to many people it's a lovely read reading that again Alan Burjou

115
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,560
observed that our culture is atypically in trying to sell a safety first concept of love

116
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,320
it is love comprehensively ensured against all risks you will have love but will have assessed

117
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,480
the prospective relationship so thoroughly will have selected your partner so carefully by

118
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,880
switching online by obtaining of course a photo details of his or her tastes date of birth

119
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:31,640
horoscope signs etc and putting it all in the mix you can tell yourself this is a risk-free option

120
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:40,200
but he fights back against such safetyism i'm convinced that love cannot be a gift given on

121
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,480
the basis of a complete lack of risk the mythic french online dating service approach reminds

122
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,240
me of the propaganda of the american army when promoting the idea of smart bombs and zero dead

123
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:00,360
wars in praise of love so we ought to pick up battles and be cognizant of the difference

124
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,480
between sacrifice for higher life-sustaining ideals of love justice etc that bring forth

125
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,960
genuine good and on the other hand suffering for the love of suffering itself the latter is

126
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:21,880
nothing but vanity and exhibitionism any blind renunciation of pleasure and seeking of suffering

127
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:28,200
becomes a kind of Machiavellian narcissism worse than what you'd see from a typical more explicit

128
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,560
trump-like narcissists as the former is the ultimate wolf in sheep's clothing

129
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,800
ergo as jujek candidly tells us never fall in love with your suffering suffering as a category

130
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,240
but i'd go a step further and assert never fall in love with suffering as a category period firstly

131
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,080
because it's simply un-pragmatic suffering doesn't make anyone's life better and has no

132
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:02,120
ennobling qualities in itself secondly and more importantly the fixation of suffering has imbued

133
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:09,160
unspeakable amounts of evil kiss in point i'm disgusted by how post-modern neoliberals that's

134
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:16,120
most of us fetishize poverty we implicitly believe there's some deepfound wisdom in the suffering

135
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,520
of the poor that those exploited in the mica mines in india for extortionate makeup products

136
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,640
have a profundity to their souls that we degenerate westerners have lost or we would

137
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,480
salivatingly cite an outdated statistic about bangladeshi people being happier

138
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,120
than rich americans footnote who says happiness is the purpose of life or that it's even something

139
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,880
worth measuring it doesn't matter that they're happier if the rapacious fashion industry aloves

140
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,760
for tragedies like the rana plaza collapse in such moments happiness is an unethical category

141
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:59,400
it's out of the question but isn't all of this romanticization of poverty at a nonsense isn't it

142
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:06,040
yet another example of the aforementioned suffering fetish this time despicably manifested in the

143
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:12,520
political domain i doubt any of us unpretentiously listen to a poor person except to an ideological

144
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:19,320
lens which tells us what to hear over what the person's truly saying personally whenever i've

145
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:26,440
spoken to someone struggling to survive and barely making ends meet i see nothing but despondency

146
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,680
pain and resentment not the pristine goodness in the souls of poor folk would prescribe on them

147
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,320
not the wisdom of the heart we'd read about in a charles dickens novel of course dickens knew

148
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:46,920
this better than all of us i partially blame the misappropriation of the crucifixion for the

149
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:54,920
fetishism of suffering i'm not surprised as someone deeply enamored by christ the crucifixion

150
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,000
is an infinite superhistorical event happening in the eternal now footnote

151
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:09,080
i borrow this term from poldtelics book eternal now which encapsulate most of his superlative

152
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:16,280
theology i highly recommend that book he probably gives the best description of god that i've

153
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:23,240
ever read in my life and i think he's right he's correct to describe god as the ground of all being

154
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:31,160
actually i say meditating on it has changed my life or more accurately given me a new one

155
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,560
and i shall expand on the matter in later essays in any case crucified christ is only

156
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,720
part of the christian narrative and we replace the whole with a fragment at great peril we ought to

157
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:51,160
never forget christ also resurrected as bizarre as that sounds notwithstanding one's religious

158
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:58,120
beliefs be it atheist or spiritual but not religious all of us think of ourselves as a

159
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:05,560
suffering christ carrying a cross footnote to understand why i recommend starting with

160
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:12,600
tom holland's dominion and slavojic's fragile absolutes because as don cupid wrote nobody in

161
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,680
the west can be holy non christian you make hold yourself non christian but the dreams you dream

162
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:26,120
are still christian dreams since we even migrants to the west like myself dream in christianity

163
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,880
we ought to never rush into glamorizing the suffering christ and instead be searingly

164
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,960
skeptical of our underlying humanistic intentions behind the vinnia of self-sacrificial love

165
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:46,440
perhaps christ was thinking my dad's a malevolent sedomasticistic son of a bitch who's thrown me

166
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:53,320
into gratuitous suffering because of a twisted cosmic jurisprudential atonement he's conjured

167
00:16:53,320 --> 00:17:01,800
up ex nihilo at least this is what theologians like william lane craig tell us if christ was the

168
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:08,360
gold man then for him to say ally ally lamar sabustani my god my god why have you forsaken me

169
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:16,040
is an unsurprising remark for one to make while being crucified and here as jujek points out

170
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,840
momentarily god himself becomes an atheist it's the negation and even hatred of god

171
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,560
e.g. book of job that makes christianity unique from any other religion and makes our culture

172
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,600
outlandish footnote martin scorsese's silence explores this phenomenon well with the modern

173
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:44,360
flavor of man's helpless frustration at god and gk chesterton's orthodoxy encapsulates his idea

174
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,760
best from any modern theology i've ever read we see in christianity the utmost palpable story

175
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:57,720
of existence human suffering can be so unbearable that even god once he comes down to us realizes

176
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:05,160
he can't bear it and loses faith ergo the separation from god is a part of divinity itself

177
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:11,080
and it's only the christian god that knows the alienation of being human i go on these detours

178
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,400
only to explicate my view that suffering in itself has no higher soul maturing virtue

179
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:26,120
we don't have to artificially create and fetishize it as pain tragedy and our happiness are already

180
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:33,480
concomitant with the vicissitudes of life so despite this newsletter being called the unhappy

181
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,520
man i shall never fall in love with unhappiness and suffering if i ever do i will stop writing

182
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,720
