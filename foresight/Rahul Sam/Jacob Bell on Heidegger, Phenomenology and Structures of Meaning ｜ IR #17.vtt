00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
Jacob Bell is a philosopher and writer.

00:02.800 --> 00:05.640
He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy

00:05.640 --> 00:07.920
from the American Public University

00:07.920 --> 00:11.120
and is doing his masters of research in philosophy

00:11.120 --> 00:14.500
at the University of Wales, Trinity St. David.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.400
The working title for his dissertation

00:17.400 --> 00:19.840
is a Phenomenological Analysis

00:19.840 --> 00:22.520
of the Structures of Meaningfulness.

00:22.520 --> 00:25.120
Jacob's primary academic interests

00:25.120 --> 00:28.800
include phenomenology and existentialism.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.480
So Jacob, that's like the formal definition

00:31.480 --> 00:34.040
or the formal bio, let's say.

00:34.040 --> 00:37.080
Would you want to give an introduction yourself, Mayne?

00:39.440 --> 00:42.040
I'll give a less technical introduction and say,

00:43.720 --> 00:46.480
I like thinking about weird things

00:46.480 --> 00:49.440
and philosophy is the perfect discipline

00:49.440 --> 00:50.920
that'll have me to do that.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.880
But yeah, no, I don't have anything else to add.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.920
A Bachelor of Weird Things, that sounds good.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.840
Sounds very much like what we're all interested in, isn't it?

01:01.840 --> 01:03.000
Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.040
Yeah, so let's jump into it.

01:05.040 --> 01:08.400
For starters, maybe let's get some definitions out of the way

01:08.400 --> 01:10.680
to lay some groundwork.

01:10.680 --> 01:15.320
So within your fields of interest,

01:15.320 --> 01:20.080
some, let's say, terms would be philosophy of mind,

01:20.080 --> 01:23.040
phenomenology and existentialism.

01:23.160 --> 01:27.560
So maybe you could give us a bit of a elucidation

01:27.560 --> 01:31.760
on what those terms are, how they interconnect

01:31.760 --> 01:34.320
and correlate, but also how they are a part

01:34.320 --> 01:37.960
of a broader philosophical framework or a school of thought.

01:39.840 --> 01:43.760
Yeah, so philosophy of mind,

01:43.760 --> 01:47.880
I guess I understand that as a branch of philosophy

01:47.880 --> 01:51.640
that kind of investigates things like mind and consciousness,

01:51.640 --> 01:53.600
which, I mean, to be honest, is a really bad way

01:53.600 --> 01:56.600
of defining the topic, because you don't get any further

01:56.600 --> 01:59.640
than the phrase itself.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.200
So I guess to go into it a little bit further.

02:04.040 --> 02:08.480
If anybody is familiar with philosophy,

02:08.480 --> 02:10.360
they've probably heard of things like physicalism

02:10.360 --> 02:12.120
and idealism and dualism.

02:12.120 --> 02:16.760
Those are like some, I mean, those are metaphysical theories,

02:16.760 --> 02:19.400
but they're prevalent and they're always being discussed

02:19.400 --> 02:20.800
in philosophy of mind.

02:20.840 --> 02:25.360
So you might find people in philosophy of mind working

02:25.360 --> 02:29.560
on trying to discern whether the mind is a physical thing

02:29.560 --> 02:32.960
or if it's a separate substance

02:34.400 --> 02:36.760
or if maybe it's fundamental,

02:36.760 --> 02:40.000
like maybe a panpsychist sort of take on it.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.520
So those are like some of the more popular topics

02:42.520 --> 02:45.560
that philosophers of mind are working in,

02:45.560 --> 02:50.560
I guess, something maybe a little more specific than that.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.200
You get to think about idea of the perception.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.160
What is what I'm perceiving the real world?

02:58.160 --> 02:59.960
There's a representation that kind of plays

02:59.960 --> 03:04.000
into philosophy of mind and metaphysics more broadly,

03:04.000 --> 03:05.960
which then feeds into ideas like,

03:07.160 --> 03:10.240
is the world a mental construct or is it independent of us

03:10.240 --> 03:13.800
and then you start to get into topics of realism.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.840
And so it all kind of feeds back into each other,

03:17.840 --> 03:21.560
but I think as far as contemporary philosophy goes

03:22.560 --> 03:24.280
or philosophy of mind goes,

03:24.280 --> 03:25.640
really what you're seeing,

03:25.640 --> 03:27.680
or at least what I see 90% of the time

03:27.680 --> 03:32.680
are people trying to struggle with where to place consciousness

03:33.960 --> 03:37.040
as far as in a physical world, in a mental world,

03:37.040 --> 03:39.880
in a dualistic world or as something fundamental.

03:41.080 --> 03:46.080
So one thing I've learned recently being a neophyte

03:46.200 --> 03:50.760
is that it seems that all the concepts of ideas

03:50.760 --> 03:53.600
and philosophy, it never is arbitrary.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.960
It doesn't just come sort of deos,

03:56.960 --> 03:59.160
ex machina, I don't know where.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.800
It does have an history.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.880
And where would you sort of, again,

04:05.880 --> 04:08.440
I propose philosophy of mind,

04:08.440 --> 04:11.440
where would you, is there a starting point

04:11.440 --> 04:14.720
where at one point in the history of human,

04:14.760 --> 04:17.120
let's say, human knowledge,

04:17.120 --> 04:19.320
people start getting interested in this topic,

04:19.320 --> 04:23.240
or has it in some sense been the ultimate question,

04:23.240 --> 04:26.600
time immemorial ever since the dawn of consciousness,

04:26.600 --> 04:27.440
let's say?

04:30.480 --> 04:32.480
Which question specifically you're referring to?

04:32.480 --> 04:34.800
Let's talk about philosophy of mind for now.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.320
Yeah, I mean, I think I came,

04:38.320 --> 04:41.520
I don't know if you say I was gonna,

04:41.520 --> 04:43.080
I wanna say pre-socratics,

04:43.080 --> 04:46.120
but I think maybe shortly after the pre-socratics

04:46.120 --> 04:46.960
with Plato,

04:48.560 --> 04:50.160
because with the pre-socratics,

04:50.160 --> 04:53.000
you see some pretty heavy metaphysical stuff going on,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.840
but it's mostly like, is the world made up,

04:56.840 --> 05:00.720
I mean, democratists with the very early atomic theory,

05:00.720 --> 05:03.320
is everything Adam's been avoiding moving around,

05:03.320 --> 05:08.120
or is everything water, is everything fire?

05:08.120 --> 05:11.640
So you have this idea of like monism in the pre-socratics.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.160
Sorry, maybe because that's the top,

05:14.160 --> 05:16.160
that term is quite a loaded term.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.320
So monism is the idea that,

05:19.320 --> 05:20.560
well, actually I'll let you explain,

05:20.560 --> 05:23.760
Jacob, please, if you could explain what monism is.

05:23.760 --> 05:28.760
Tom, so the term just signifies the idea that everything is

05:28.760 --> 05:31.360
one or everything's made out of one particular type.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.840
There's no duality.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.920
Yeah, and I guess that's just one way of putting it to you,

05:35.920 --> 05:38.120
because I mean, I'm saying things are made out of one type

05:38.120 --> 05:40.520
of stuff, so I'm kind of implying that we're talking

05:40.520 --> 05:42.760
about substance-based,

05:42.760 --> 05:44.600
philosophy, substance-based metaphysics,

05:44.600 --> 05:46.960
where like the pre-socratics talking

05:46.960 --> 05:48.880
about different types of material

05:48.880 --> 05:50.520
that things might be made of.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.360
And then, yeah, I guess that kind of leads

05:55.360 --> 05:57.720
into a little bit of philosophy of mind

05:57.720 --> 05:59.800
when you get to Plato and talking about the ideas

05:59.800 --> 06:02.920
and talking about theory of forms and stuff like that.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.400
And so, yeah, I guess philosophy of mind really came

06:08.400 --> 06:10.720
about around the time of Plato.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.840
I mean, I'm not a great historian of science,

06:13.840 --> 06:16.840
so somebody might be able to correct me on that, but...

06:16.840 --> 06:18.360
Oh, better than me, mate, better than me.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.360
So that's something I've always wondered

06:21.360 --> 06:24.520
where initially the idea came from,

06:24.520 --> 06:28.720
or was it more like the Aristotelian way

06:28.720 --> 06:32.040
where people instead of focusing on philosophy of mind,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.400
humanity or human beings were more focused on

06:36.400 --> 06:37.920
let's say the physical world,

06:37.920 --> 06:39.440
the way a scientist would be.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.840
How do things move, causality?

06:41.840 --> 06:44.160
But I'm coming to realize, perhaps,

06:44.160 --> 06:45.400
that it was the other way around,

06:45.400 --> 06:47.840
even before people were interested in the physical world,

06:47.840 --> 06:52.000
it was more on the world of mental constructs,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.520
even things like ethics or metaphysics.

06:54.520 --> 06:58.000
And it's, maybe we could get into, you know,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.240
fewer, fewer writings that shift

07:00.240 --> 07:03.240
where now it seems people are more physicalists

07:03.240 --> 07:05.800
over, let's say, idealists

07:05.800 --> 07:07.800
and why that change has taken place.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.720
And then in your paper, where you talk about meaning,

07:11.720 --> 07:13.880
sort of the ontology of meaning, one of your papers,

07:13.880 --> 07:16.240
you kind of discuss what the, let's say,

07:16.240 --> 07:18.760
the social consequences of that could be.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.680
But anyway, I don't want to get too carried away.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.280
Okay, now we get to the interesting stuff,

07:24.280 --> 07:26.320
whether the fields that you're interested in,

07:26.320 --> 07:28.800
and this is what really drew me to your work,

07:30.080 --> 07:32.560
that's phenomenology and existentialism,

07:32.560 --> 07:35.600
or the way you put it, weird stuff.

07:35.600 --> 07:39.320
So could you please explain in the field of weird stuff,

07:39.320 --> 07:42.440
what that is, what those two terms mean?

07:42.440 --> 07:46.320
And I guess, look, anyone could Google

07:46.320 --> 07:48.280
what phenomenology or existentialism is,

07:48.280 --> 07:53.280
but maybe personal to you, how do you give it?

07:53.880 --> 07:58.600
And maybe juxtapose it with some other schools of thought

07:58.600 --> 08:03.040
in philosophy and science to explain it, please.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.400
Sure, before I do dive into phenomenology,

08:06.400 --> 08:08.920
I just want to place one little caveat

08:08.920 --> 08:12.080
on what I was just saying with regards to philosophy in mind,

08:12.080 --> 08:14.000
and saying that I was generally speaking

08:14.000 --> 08:15.400
of Western philosophy.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.840
I mean, if we start to look at Eastern philosophy,

08:18.840 --> 08:21.120
I mean, we're going to be able to look back,

08:21.120 --> 08:24.080
way before the pre-sacratic into philosophies

08:24.080 --> 08:26.800
and different things like that to get certain ideas of,

08:26.800 --> 08:29.120
I mean, they had some ideas of idealism

08:29.120 --> 08:31.400
before I think any Westerners really did.

08:31.400 --> 08:35.240
So we could look back in history much further

08:35.240 --> 08:38.040
if we were looking to the East as well.

08:38.040 --> 08:39.680
So I just wanted to make that point.

08:39.680 --> 08:44.680
So I didn't seem ignorant to the other side of things there.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.520
Of course, and I point well taken, point well taken.

08:47.520 --> 08:51.760
Yeah, in fact, maybe now I need to kind of change

08:51.760 --> 08:56.760
what I said before or add on to it,

08:57.000 --> 09:01.320
because certainly in a lot of Eastern philosophy,

09:01.320 --> 09:05.000
consciousness in the mind, let's say, was a big part of,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.840
well, more than philosophical practices,

09:07.840 --> 09:09.680
more like spiritual practices, isn't it?

09:09.680 --> 09:13.400
But now we get to the, this is probably semantics,

09:13.400 --> 09:15.920
like how do we discern spirituality and philosophy?

09:15.920 --> 09:18.040
What's the difference?

09:18.040 --> 09:20.800
But that perhaps the whole other conversation.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.680
Yeah, yeah.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.360
Yeah, sorry, go ahead.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.920
I was going to say that'd be a big conversation

09:26.920 --> 09:28.280
just in itself.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.120
No, man.

09:29.240 --> 09:32.760
I'm hoping to, in fact, speak to John Mavaki

09:32.760 --> 09:34.440
because he seems like the perfect person

09:34.440 --> 09:37.880
to discuss those nuances and subtleties

09:37.880 --> 09:39.920
between all these terms.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.120
Yeah, but saying that.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.480
So yeah, sorry, existentialism and phenomenology.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.880
So phenomenology, I'll give a very brief,

09:50.880 --> 09:55.040
I guess like formal description of it.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.080
I guess just trying to place it in history a little bit

09:57.080 --> 09:58.320
because it's a relatively, I mean,

09:58.440 --> 10:00.480
when we're talking about philosophy,

10:00.480 --> 10:01.920
it's relatively new.

10:01.920 --> 10:06.600
I mean, early 1900s, late 1800s is when Husserl,

10:06.600 --> 10:10.160
Edmund Husserl was working on publishing

10:10.160 --> 10:13.600
the first formal definition, the descriptions

10:13.600 --> 10:16.280
of what he took phenomenology to be.

10:16.280 --> 10:20.200
So he's considered the founder of phenomenology formally.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.960
Anyway, you can find threads of it

10:21.960 --> 10:24.440
throughout the history of philosophy.

10:25.280 --> 10:30.040
But yeah, so he published in The Logical Investigations

10:30.040 --> 10:32.560
and then I think like then 12 years later in Ideas,

10:33.520 --> 10:37.520
kind of like almost like I got some guidelines

10:37.520 --> 10:40.160
as to what phenomenology is or should be.

10:40.160 --> 10:44.320
And very basically, it's the study of experience

10:44.320 --> 10:48.680
as experience and that doesn't say up a lot,

10:49.760 --> 10:54.400
but it's really about taking your first person perspective

10:55.400 --> 10:59.560
and kind of applying some rigorous analysis

10:59.560 --> 11:02.720
to your experience and trying to figure out

11:02.720 --> 11:06.880
what certain things mean, trying to make sense of things

11:06.880 --> 11:10.880
as you experience them, as opposed to kind of standing

11:10.880 --> 11:15.880
outside of your experience or trying to put the experience

11:16.280 --> 11:20.120
aside to get a more objective view of the world.

11:20.960 --> 11:25.960
So it stands in direct contrast with things like empirical

11:27.800 --> 11:28.640
science.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.040
I mean, you're not going to find an awful lot

11:31.040 --> 11:33.760
of phenomenology there, except in neuroscience.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.040
And we can talk about that later.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.240
I actually made a note because I want to talk about that

11:37.240 --> 11:38.080
a little bit.

11:39.880 --> 11:44.320
Because of phenomenology, we're taking into consideration

11:44.320 --> 11:48.160
our feelings and our moods and our personal values

11:48.200 --> 11:53.200
and things like that as ways of understanding the world,

11:54.720 --> 11:59.120
you could say, whereas as guides to understanding the world.

11:59.120 --> 12:03.000
I mean, just for example, if we're talking about meaning,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.480
which I'm sure we will get around to it later,

12:05.480 --> 12:09.200
but I'll just make a comment here about it.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.760
I mean, if we're talking about meaning in life,

12:13.440 --> 12:16.480
if you take an objective, try to take a scientific

12:16.480 --> 12:18.760
objective approach to that, you're not really going to be

12:18.760 --> 12:21.640
able to say what's meaningful to you because you're going

12:21.640 --> 12:26.640
to be kind of prevented from considering your interests

12:26.800 --> 12:29.640
and your values and some of the things that you're passionate

12:29.640 --> 12:32.560
about, the things that you're interested in in life,

12:32.560 --> 12:34.160
the way you feel about things.

12:34.160 --> 12:38.360
And if you take all of that out of consideration,

12:38.360 --> 12:41.160
I don't know how you would calculate a meaning in life.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.280
Yeah, of course.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.480
So maybe one example I enjoy, I read somewhere,

12:51.480 --> 12:55.360
is to kind of maybe use like an analogy.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.160
It probably, I probably wouldn't even call this an analogy

12:58.160 --> 13:01.120
because it's, in fact, what a phenomenologist would do.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.480
So as a phenomenologist, if I give you a,

13:04.480 --> 13:07.600
and I'm sorry to kind of put you on the spot here,

13:07.600 --> 13:11.480
but as a phenomenologist, if I give you a cup of coffee,

13:11.480 --> 13:13.720
what would you do?

13:13.720 --> 13:18.040
If you're told, let's say by Husserl himself,

13:18.040 --> 13:22.640
a guy comes back from the dead, from Resorex

13:22.640 --> 13:26.400
and tells you that, study this cup of coffee

13:26.400 --> 13:30.440
as a phenomenologist, how would you do that?

13:30.440 --> 13:31.840
What would your process be?

13:33.320 --> 13:37.080
Well, so I guess it depends on whose phenomenology we're using.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.880
So after Husserl-

13:38.880 --> 13:40.360
Spoken like a true philosopher.

13:41.360 --> 13:45.480
After Husserl, you know, kind of formally came out

13:45.480 --> 13:48.200
with the idea and it started getting,

13:49.280 --> 13:50.840
I mean, he got a lot of interest right away.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.240
I mean, it was a really,

13:52.240 --> 13:56.000
it's for such a new and kind of

13:58.120 --> 14:01.600
divergent approach to doing philosophy.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.200
It gained a lot of interest really quickly,

14:03.200 --> 14:06.480
but pretty much everybody who took over the approach

14:06.480 --> 14:08.320
took it over in their own way.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.960
And I don't think we could really say

14:09.960 --> 14:13.400
that anybody had the same sort of phenomenological method.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.560
I mean, Husserl had very specific techniques

14:16.560 --> 14:18.280
that he wanted that he thought we should apply

14:18.280 --> 14:20.960
while we're doing phenomenology, like the echocache,

14:20.960 --> 14:23.080
which is just to like suspend or bracket

14:23.080 --> 14:25.720
what he calls the natural attitude.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.120
And that's just to say like the kind of habitual way

14:28.120 --> 14:31.800
in which we interpret our experience.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.960
He said, you know, let's just like put those aside.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.120
Let's ignore that sort of stuff

14:36.120 --> 14:38.760
and try to just pay attention to the experience

14:38.760 --> 14:41.520
as we're experiencing it and describe it as such.

14:43.760 --> 14:48.400
Now, you get it, right out following that,

14:48.400 --> 14:52.120
you get Meryl Lopanti, a French phenomenologist,

14:52.120 --> 14:53.720
saying, you know, in his practice,

14:53.720 --> 14:55.280
the phenomenology of perception.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.560
One of the most important things we learned

14:57.560 --> 15:01.320
about the phenomenological reduction

15:02.000 --> 15:04.200
who Husserl described it is that

15:05.640 --> 15:07.600
a full reduction is impossible

15:07.600 --> 15:08.800
because we can never get rid of

15:08.800 --> 15:10.200
all of our interpretive strategies.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.800
If we did, we wouldn't be able to make sense

15:11.800 --> 15:13.640
or describe our experience at all.

15:15.800 --> 15:19.160
And he's not the only one that kind of criticized that.

15:19.160 --> 15:22.960
I mean, Heidegger did to a much greater degree.

15:22.960 --> 15:26.280
Heidegger has a very specific concept of phenomenology,

15:27.640 --> 15:30.560
not necessarily what you think phenomenology should study,

15:30.600 --> 15:32.360
but kind of the approach.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.960
He thinks that the approach should be a specific way.

15:35.960 --> 15:40.960
Like we're looking to derive specific truths

15:41.040 --> 15:44.000
about the world and the phenomenon in the world

15:44.000 --> 15:45.600
when we're using phenomenology.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.560
And so he's there, everybody, I mean,

15:47.560 --> 15:49.520
I guess all the phenomenologists are limiting

15:49.520 --> 15:53.480
in their views on what phenomenology should do.

15:53.480 --> 15:57.120
But I do wanna say something about the way

15:57.120 --> 15:59.560
in which Heidegger defines phenomenology

15:59.560 --> 16:03.920
because I think it's a very brilliant description of it.

16:05.720 --> 16:10.720
And so Heidegger, when he's describing phenomenology

16:12.120 --> 16:15.720
and being in time, but also in the lecture course,

16:15.720 --> 16:18.360
given a few years before he's published being in time,

16:18.360 --> 16:19.320
and that lecture course is called

16:19.320 --> 16:20.960
the History of the Concept of Time.

16:22.600 --> 16:23.920
Sorry, just to clarify.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.480
So being in time is Heidegger's Macdemopus, right?

16:26.480 --> 16:28.880
We should probably put that out.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.040
Sorry, I didn't interrupt you, Jacob, keep going, yeah.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.640
No, you're good.

16:33.640 --> 16:36.160
Yeah, being in time is what he's most famous for.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.120
Even though, I mean, he wrote a lot.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.520
He has a lot of books, he has a lot of papers.

16:41.520 --> 16:44.360
His later work differs a little bit from his early work,

16:44.360 --> 16:48.400
but there's also a dispute as to how real the turn is.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.640
The later Heidegger and the early Heidegger, yeah.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.840
Yeah, and I'm not really knowledgeable enough

16:55.840 --> 16:59.080
to comment on how different those two things are.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.840
I'm kind of working my way chronologically

17:00.840 --> 17:02.320
through this moment's work.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.440
But yeah, in being in time,

17:06.440 --> 17:08.360
and his earlier lecture course,

17:10.560 --> 17:15.040
he describes phenomenology by going back to the ways

17:15.040 --> 17:20.040
in which the Greeks use the term phenomenon in logos.

17:20.400 --> 17:24.200
So he's kind of taking apart the term phenomenology

17:24.240 --> 17:28.560
and separating it and looking

17:28.560 --> 17:31.920
to the Greek definitions of this.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.960
And in the book, Heidegger says that, you know,

17:35.960 --> 17:38.920
that the Greeks understood the term phenomenon

17:38.920 --> 17:43.800
as this is gonna sound very obscure and esoteric,

17:43.800 --> 17:45.920
but I'm gonna give hopefully an easier

17:45.920 --> 17:47.880
to understand description afterward.

17:47.880 --> 17:51.800
But he says, phenomenon is that which shows itself

17:51.800 --> 17:53.720
in itself, which is a manifest.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.200
Typical Heidegger.

17:55.200 --> 18:00.200
Yeah, and the term for the Greeks also carried connotation

18:00.480 --> 18:03.640
of like bringing something to light and illuminating.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.080
And then the logos, Heidegger explains,

18:08.080 --> 18:11.040
the Greeks understood by the logos,

18:11.040 --> 18:12.480
something like discoursing,

18:12.480 --> 18:14.760
but not just like, not just dial fuck

18:14.760 --> 18:16.280
and not just a verbal utterance,

18:16.280 --> 18:19.200
but it's more of a discursive communication

18:19.200 --> 18:22.880
that lets something be seen.

18:24.040 --> 18:29.040
And so you could think of the logos as words,

18:29.400 --> 18:32.300
whether utter or written down or what have you,

18:34.080 --> 18:37.640
that point to something, they let something be seen.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.240
It's kind of, it's bringing something to light,

18:40.240 --> 18:42.160
it's bringing the phenomenon to light.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.840
And so we wanna understand this in a less obscure

18:44.840 --> 18:47.400
and difficult way than Heidegger likes to put things.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.400
We can say something like, the logos points

18:52.400 --> 18:54.280
to the phenomenon in such a way

18:54.280 --> 18:56.600
that the phenomenon becomes un-concealed

18:56.600 --> 18:59.360
or the logos allows the phenomenon to come into view

18:59.360 --> 19:01.440
by looking and out of experience

19:01.440 --> 19:02.960
in such a way that it can be seen.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.560
And so really it's almost like your words should connect

19:06.560 --> 19:09.760
with something that can be pointed out in experience

19:09.760 --> 19:12.000
or can be shown in experience.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.200
And so we're not, and he contrasts this

19:15.200 --> 19:19.760
with the idea of free-floating concepts and words and ideas.

19:20.760 --> 19:24.160
And by that, he just means something like,

19:24.160 --> 19:27.920
we don't wanna abstract away so much from experience

19:27.920 --> 19:31.400
that we're just playing language games.

19:31.400 --> 19:35.640
We want our words to be able to meet up with experience

19:35.640 --> 19:39.840
in such a way that if I say something,

19:39.840 --> 19:41.800
so like in some of my papers about meaning

19:41.800 --> 19:43.040
what I'm trying to do,

19:43.040 --> 19:45.360
that I'm trying to point to experience,

19:45.360 --> 19:48.240
I'm trying to point to particular experiences

19:48.240 --> 19:52.320
and particular moments in particular experiences

19:52.320 --> 19:55.680
where maybe someone might find meaning.

19:55.680 --> 20:00.680
So I'm not, I'm just trying to bring something into view

20:01.360 --> 20:03.320
using words and concepts.

20:04.880 --> 20:05.920
I'm glad you said that, Jacob,

20:05.920 --> 20:09.440
because in one of your papers, I forget which one,

20:09.440 --> 20:10.760
you've sort of touched on this,

20:10.760 --> 20:14.160
but a question that came to mind was,

20:14.160 --> 20:16.520
so from the definition you gave,

20:16.520 --> 20:18.480
definition of phenomenology,

20:18.480 --> 20:21.320
how does that differ from, let's say,

20:21.320 --> 20:23.960
the empiricist tradition or the empiricist approach,

20:23.960 --> 20:27.480
which tends to be quite popular these days,

20:27.480 --> 20:30.000
especially in the world of artificial intelligence,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.880
where we think that our epistemology or our knowledge

20:33.880 --> 20:36.400
or our truths of the world is revealed

20:36.400 --> 20:38.760
purely based on empiricism,

20:38.760 --> 20:41.840
which is experiencing measuring things

20:41.840 --> 20:45.000
and that in some sense, the mind is a blank canvas

20:45.000 --> 20:48.480
and the world just gives us information and input.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.120
So from the empirical approach,

20:50.120 --> 20:51.880
how does phenomenology differ?

20:53.520 --> 20:56.040
So phenomenology is gonna differ in the sense that,

20:56.040 --> 20:58.480
okay, so if we think about the empirical approach,

20:58.480 --> 21:01.720
specifically as it pertains to the sciences,

21:05.160 --> 21:08.560
we're trying to get a collection of experiences

21:08.560 --> 21:11.040
that kind of compile and point toward the same

21:11.040 --> 21:12.440
sort of thing in experience.

21:13.200 --> 21:18.200
Now, the major difference I guess is going to be

21:18.360 --> 21:22.120
what it is we're trying to discern in empirical science

21:22.120 --> 21:24.640
as opposed to something like Heidegger's phenomenology

21:24.640 --> 21:27.040
or the way that I just described phenomenology.

21:29.840 --> 21:33.040
With a scientific and empirical approach,

21:33.040 --> 21:37.080
we're usually looking at objects

21:37.080 --> 21:38.880
and we're trying to figure out

21:38.880 --> 21:40.920
what sort of properties these objects have.

21:41.920 --> 21:46.760
And so, I mean, I guess physics or chemistry

21:46.760 --> 21:48.360
is a great example of that.

21:48.360 --> 21:51.920
And we're trying to see maybe what house to entities

21:51.920 --> 21:53.240
interact with each other.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.160
And we're going to perform experiments to do that

21:57.160 --> 22:00.360
and we're gonna try to replicate the experiments.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.600
And we're gonna try to not let our first person

22:03.600 --> 22:08.600
perspective influence exactly what we're investigating.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.360
So, phenomenology is gonna differ from that.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.040
In that we're not collecting data

22:14.040 --> 22:16.160
and we're not measuring stuff.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.200
We're experiencing, we're trying to pay attention

22:18.200 --> 22:20.560
to the experience as it's experienced.

22:20.560 --> 22:24.440
So, you're not gonna measure your experience of meaning,

22:24.440 --> 22:28.240
say you're going to more so,

22:28.240 --> 22:30.040
if you're doing a phenomenology

22:30.040 --> 22:33.920
and you're trying to discern maybe what you find meaningful,

22:33.920 --> 22:38.200
you're going to more so reflect on maybe

22:38.200 --> 22:40.000
the way that you feel

22:40.000 --> 22:42.880
when you were participating in a certain activity.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.840
And from there, you might also start to look

22:46.840 --> 22:50.800
at the structures of the experience,

22:50.800 --> 22:53.160
more so than just the feeling of the experience,

22:53.160 --> 22:56.960
which might be what's involved in this activity

22:56.960 --> 22:58.960
or what's involved in this experience.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.200
What are the things that are essential

23:02.200 --> 23:05.280
to the experience without which I could no longer say

23:05.280 --> 23:07.560
that it was a meaningful experience.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.720
Those are the sorts of things

23:08.720 --> 23:12.080
that sort of questions phenomenology is going to ask

23:12.080 --> 23:13.800
and specifically high digger

23:13.800 --> 23:16.360
because specifically for high digger,

23:16.360 --> 23:21.360
he's wanting to discern the a priori structures

23:22.800 --> 23:24.640
of existence and experience,

23:24.640 --> 23:29.120
which is just to say a priori meaning

23:30.320 --> 23:31.320
always already there.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.320
Like what's necessary?

23:34.720 --> 23:36.960
What are the, what structures are necessary

23:37.000 --> 23:38.480
for this to exist

23:38.480 --> 23:40.840
or for me to have this particular experience?

23:45.840 --> 23:47.080
Yeah, I guess I'll leave it at that for now

23:47.080 --> 23:49.360
because otherwise I'm going to get into a really deep,

23:49.360 --> 23:51.120
or you can ask a clarifying question

23:51.120 --> 23:53.120
because otherwise I'm just going to go on at the end.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.600
No, that was perfect, mate.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.800
I think in many ways you lead me to my next question.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.960
I mean, I thought we were going to discuss

24:01.960 --> 24:05.360
existentialism too because obviously it's kind of

24:05.360 --> 24:07.240
like the precursor or not the precursor,

24:07.240 --> 24:10.320
but it's highly correlated to phenomenology.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.840
But perhaps since we're already on this topic,

24:15.000 --> 24:17.800
in some sense, I kind of regret even asking that question

24:17.800 --> 24:21.360
because I'm coming to realize that maybe it's not fair

24:21.360 --> 24:25.840
to ask questions such as, oh, what's the difference

24:25.840 --> 24:27.720
or what's the stark difference

24:27.720 --> 24:30.960
between phenomenology and science?

24:30.960 --> 24:34.160
Because if you think of a field like let's say psychology

24:34.160 --> 24:36.120
or cognitive science,

24:36.120 --> 24:38.440
those fields have had a massive influence

24:38.440 --> 24:41.400
by thinkers like Merleau Ponty

24:41.400 --> 24:43.840
or Heidegger by phenomenologists.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.960
So, well, the question I was going to ask is,

24:47.960 --> 24:51.440
how does phenomenology, and I was also going to say

24:51.440 --> 24:53.360
existentialism, but we didn't get to that still,

24:53.360 --> 24:56.600
but let's just say, how does phenomenology differ

24:56.600 --> 24:59.360
from a more scientific approach?

24:59.360 --> 25:01.760
But maybe to make things even a bit more interesting,

25:01.760 --> 25:05.360
let's talk about, in fact, how does it relate

25:05.360 --> 25:07.720
to fields like psychology and cognitive science

25:07.720 --> 25:10.200
where in the scientific approach,

25:10.200 --> 25:13.240
what we always try and do is remove the subject,

25:13.240 --> 25:15.280
so remove the subjective experience.

25:15.280 --> 25:19.000
But clearly, there are some fields even within science,

25:19.000 --> 25:19.840
but you can't do that.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.440
You can't remove the subject

25:21.440 --> 25:23.880
from cognitive science or psychology.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.200
So maybe to make things a bit more interesting,

25:26.200 --> 25:28.280
how do they correlate, how do they connect

25:28.280 --> 25:30.580
to phenomenology, those fields I mentioned?

25:31.540 --> 25:32.380
Sure, sure.

25:33.740 --> 25:36.060
So I want to comment on cognitive science

25:36.060 --> 25:37.940
just a little bit first, and then I want to maybe dive

25:37.940 --> 25:39.500
into a little bit of neuroscience

25:39.500 --> 25:41.620
and how phenomenology might be related,

25:41.620 --> 25:45.740
because I actually presented a paper last year

25:45.740 --> 25:49.020
at a philosophy conference hosted by a university

25:49.020 --> 25:50.900
in the Czech Republic on this topic

25:50.900 --> 25:52.100
of phenomenology neuroscience.

25:52.100 --> 25:54.740
But before I get to that, you know,

25:54.740 --> 25:58.420
something that I really appreciate about cognitive science

25:58.420 --> 26:03.420
is that it really embraces the subjective experience.

26:06.180 --> 26:08.660
And like you said, you can't remove that

26:08.660 --> 26:12.620
from cognitive science, cognitive science necessarily.

26:12.620 --> 26:17.620
And I mean, so they're, I think the most prevailing approach

26:20.780 --> 26:23.260
in cognitive science right now is 4E cognitive science,

26:23.260 --> 26:24.740
and that's just the 440s.

26:24.740 --> 26:27.700
I always forget one, but it stands for embeddedness

26:27.780 --> 26:30.660
and embodied, inactive, and I, like I said,

26:30.660 --> 26:32.380
I always forget the fourth one.

26:32.380 --> 26:34.460
I don't know why, but...

26:34.460 --> 26:36.860
I'll leave a little caption on whatever,

26:36.860 --> 26:39.740
just too far, if it was all good, yeah.

26:39.740 --> 26:42.740
Yeah, have somebody place in the comment where I'm from.

26:42.740 --> 26:46.140
Kind of take the video, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine.

26:46.140 --> 26:51.140
But a lot of the, so a lot of those ideas really,

26:53.020 --> 26:56.060
I mean, I believe have an inception in phenomenology.

26:56.060 --> 26:59.620
I mean, they're, you know, especially in Heidegger,

26:59.620 --> 27:01.860
with Heidegger's idea of being in the world,

27:01.860 --> 27:03.780
you know, which we'll get to.

27:05.380 --> 27:08.900
But it's just this idea that there's a more holistic structure

27:08.900 --> 27:12.580
to the world and the existence

27:12.580 --> 27:14.580
that we need to take into consideration

27:14.580 --> 27:17.100
when we're trying to understand things about the world

27:17.100 --> 27:20.340
and trying to understand things about ourselves

27:20.340 --> 27:23.620
and maybe the way in which we interact with the environment.

27:24.460 --> 27:29.460
And so, I think phenomenology played at least the role

27:29.820 --> 27:31.900
in trying and getting a lot of those ideas

27:31.900 --> 27:34.060
going for cognitive science.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.540
Now, as far as neuroscience goes,

27:42.860 --> 27:45.020
Anil Seth, I'm sure you've heard of Anil Seth.

27:45.020 --> 27:46.180
Yes, I have, yeah.

27:46.180 --> 27:49.060
He recently wrote a quite a popular science book

27:49.060 --> 27:49.980
right on the brain.

27:50.980 --> 27:54.980
And so he does a lot of work trying to map

27:57.540 --> 28:01.060
the brain correlates of certain experiences.

28:01.060 --> 28:03.380
So he's trying to see like what's going on in the brain

28:03.380 --> 28:06.980
at a given time when someone's having a particular experience.

28:06.980 --> 28:10.220
And he's trying to build that map out.

28:10.220 --> 28:12.980
And you can't build that map

28:12.980 --> 28:15.540
if you don't have good phenomenology.

28:15.540 --> 28:19.220
Because if you think, just think about it,

28:19.260 --> 28:20.900
if we think about it simply,

28:20.900 --> 28:25.900
as far as, okay, let's say brain region X lights up

28:26.820 --> 28:29.820
when I have experience Y.

28:29.820 --> 28:32.980
And let's say we can gather all the data we want

28:32.980 --> 28:34.580
about the brain structure

28:34.580 --> 28:38.580
and we can reproduce it and map it as much as we want.

28:38.580 --> 28:41.180
But if we don't have a good description of the experience,

28:41.180 --> 28:42.660
we're not gonna know what we're mapping

28:42.660 --> 28:45.100
this brain activity to.

28:45.100 --> 28:49.140
And so in order to have good correlative mapping,

28:49.140 --> 28:50.620
we have to have good phenomenology.

28:50.620 --> 28:53.620
We have to have like a good description of the experience.

28:53.620 --> 28:57.540
And we have to have people, the participants in the study

28:57.540 --> 28:58.500
that they're studying,

28:58.500 --> 29:01.660
trying to get this correlative mapping going.

29:01.660 --> 29:03.980
They have to be familiar with the experience,

29:03.980 --> 29:06.140
not only as it is experienced,

29:06.140 --> 29:07.860
but they have to understand what it is

29:07.860 --> 29:10.380
that the neuroscientists are trying to map.

29:10.380 --> 29:13.380
Like what experience do you want me to have?

29:13.380 --> 29:14.780
So then I can tell you what I'm having

29:14.860 --> 29:19.860
and so you can mark down what's going on in my brain

29:19.860 --> 29:21.620
when I'm having that experience.

29:21.620 --> 29:25.420
And so you have to have a whole lot of phenomenology going on.

29:25.420 --> 29:30.220
Not only the participant being able to recognize the experience

29:30.220 --> 29:34.340
and being able to communicate that to the researchers,

29:34.340 --> 29:36.660
but the researchers also have to have

29:36.660 --> 29:38.780
a pretty rich phenomenological description

29:38.780 --> 29:43.340
of what it is they want their participants to experience.

29:43.340 --> 29:47.580
And that way they know precisely when the experience has started

29:47.580 --> 29:49.700
because I mean, there might be like a very important,

29:49.700 --> 29:50.540
as far as neuroscience,

29:50.540 --> 29:53.300
so there might be a very important spike

29:53.300 --> 29:55.460
in a particular brain region

29:55.460 --> 29:59.020
that they are trying to map to a very specific,

29:59.020 --> 30:04.020
maybe milliseconds of an experience.

30:04.420 --> 30:05.500
And if you don't get that right,

30:05.500 --> 30:06.540
it's just not going to be correct.

30:06.540 --> 30:07.660
Your description is going to be wrong

30:07.660 --> 30:09.780
and your correlative mapping isn't going to mean anything

30:09.780 --> 30:12.980
because you might have one side of it,

30:12.980 --> 30:16.900
or you're going to be missing the other side of it.

30:16.900 --> 30:21.980
But also Jacob, what makes phenomenology even beyond, let's say,

30:21.980 --> 30:24.380
that because see what we are talking about here,

30:24.380 --> 30:26.260
it's how can I put this?

30:26.260 --> 30:29.140
So, oh, by the way, so the book Anil said,

30:29.140 --> 30:32.180
the person you were talking about, it's called Being You.

30:32.180 --> 30:34.700
So it's a very, I think it's a neuroscientific approach

30:34.700 --> 30:37.940
to experience, but what that got me thinking

30:37.940 --> 30:39.580
was as you were describing things,

30:39.580 --> 30:43.340
we're thinking of very localized experiences.

30:43.340 --> 30:45.340
So like, here's this pen, it's a black pen.

30:45.340 --> 30:46.700
I'm looking at it.

30:46.700 --> 30:48.260
What's my, to use a term,

30:48.260 --> 30:50.100
philosophers use qualia, let's say,

30:50.100 --> 30:52.140
and which parts of my brain likes it.

30:52.140 --> 30:55.100
But when it comes to phenomenology, of course,

30:55.100 --> 30:56.260
we even go beyond that.

30:56.260 --> 30:59.660
We even go to what you write a lot about,

30:59.660 --> 31:02.740
which is meaning and kind of the questions

31:02.740 --> 31:05.500
that truly make us human in that sense, right?

31:05.500 --> 31:09.180
So, and is that where we could maybe connect that

31:09.180 --> 31:11.060
to fields such as psychology?

31:13.220 --> 31:15.500
So I think, I mean, yeah, we could connect to there,

31:15.500 --> 31:19.140
but I think we could still even bring it back

31:19.140 --> 31:21.980
to neuroscience in the sense of,

31:21.980 --> 31:26.940
so I know there was some research done,

31:26.940 --> 31:31.940
trying to map brain activity and experiences of happiness.

31:33.660 --> 31:38.500
And this particular study didn't even have a description

31:38.500 --> 31:41.940
of what a happy experience might be as experienced.

31:41.940 --> 31:45.140
And so, that was one of the experiments

31:45.140 --> 31:47.420
that I pointed to in my paper where I said,

31:48.780 --> 31:51.660
I mean, they admit that one of the more difficult parts

31:51.660 --> 31:52.700
of what they were trying to do

31:52.700 --> 31:56.100
is the phenomenal, a lot of logical aspect of it.

31:57.100 --> 31:58.580
But at the end of the day, it's like,

31:58.580 --> 32:00.300
I mean, it doesn't really,

32:00.300 --> 32:01.740
that research can't really mean anything

32:01.740 --> 32:05.540
until you have a good description

32:05.540 --> 32:07.180
of what a happy experience is.

32:07.420 --> 32:09.780
And it's very difficult to do

32:09.780 --> 32:12.820
because obviously not everything's gonna make everybody happy.

32:12.820 --> 32:14.460
We're gonna have different,

32:14.460 --> 32:16.780
not necessarily definitions of what happiness is,

32:16.780 --> 32:18.020
although we might have that too,

32:18.020 --> 32:21.860
but different experiences are gonna make me happy

32:21.860 --> 32:24.980
and different experiences are gonna make you happy.

32:24.980 --> 32:26.260
And that gets even more complicated

32:26.260 --> 32:28.060
when we start talking about meaning.

32:29.020 --> 32:32.180
But another good example of this in neuroscience

32:32.180 --> 32:34.020
is the flow experience.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.700
So they're trying to kind of map out

32:36.700 --> 32:37.620
what's going on in the brain

32:37.620 --> 32:39.460
when somebody has an experience of flow.

32:39.460 --> 32:41.780
And not only is flow,

32:43.260 --> 32:44.820
I wouldn't say it's a rare experience

32:44.820 --> 32:46.220
for a lot of people,

32:46.220 --> 32:50.700
but it's also not an everyday sort of experience for people.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.300
And so it can be a little elusive.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.820
And again, so I think when we're talking

32:54.820 --> 32:55.860
about something like that,

32:55.860 --> 33:00.620
we're trying to do some neuroscientific research

33:00.620 --> 33:02.740
about flow and the flow experience,

33:02.740 --> 33:04.820
we need to have good phenomenology

33:04.820 --> 33:06.180
and we need to have good communication

33:06.180 --> 33:07.860
around the experience in order,

33:10.140 --> 33:12.820
I guess really in order to have good research

33:12.820 --> 33:15.300
and to be able to expand our knowledge

33:15.300 --> 33:18.900
of what it is that's going on when we're in flow.

33:20.300 --> 33:25.300
And I'm very critical of science for a lot of reasons,

33:25.700 --> 33:28.420
but I also think it's,

33:28.420 --> 33:29.540
I mean, we need science,

33:29.540 --> 33:32.420
I'm not a science denier of any sort.

33:32.420 --> 33:36.380
And I love seeing good research around these topics.

33:36.380 --> 33:38.820
It's just unfortunate that there's a lot of the research

33:38.820 --> 33:39.660
to just poor research

33:39.660 --> 33:43.460
because they kind of shit on philosophy a lot.

33:43.460 --> 33:46.100
And so I think it's philosophical discipline.

33:46.100 --> 33:48.820
I think from what I read in one of your papers,

33:48.820 --> 33:50.460
you've even used this term,

33:50.460 --> 33:54.260
it seems like you're critical of scientism, isn't it?

33:54.260 --> 33:55.900
It's not science per se,

33:55.900 --> 33:59.140
where scientism is this, like it's an ontology.

33:59.220 --> 34:02.540
The part replaces the whole.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.740
And in fact, I was watching this interview,

34:04.740 --> 34:06.260
sorry, I'm going off on a tangent here,

34:06.260 --> 34:08.100
but that's okay, it's at the conversation.

34:08.100 --> 34:11.060
I was watching an interview and Slavoj Zizek said that,

34:11.060 --> 34:13.060
that the modern problem is,

34:13.060 --> 34:14.580
the ultimate questions,

34:14.580 --> 34:16.980
do we have free will, what is consciousness?

34:17.980 --> 34:20.180
Even questions pertaining to meaning,

34:20.180 --> 34:24.460
we've localized those questions to the scientific domain

34:24.460 --> 34:26.300
where historically,

34:26.300 --> 34:28.580
those things were normally answered by philosophers

34:28.580 --> 34:30.140
and philosophers have the ability

34:30.140 --> 34:31.420
to pull it from different disciplines

34:31.420 --> 34:33.460
and kind of connect them all together,

34:33.460 --> 34:37.060
where science, it's affected by what science is,

34:37.060 --> 34:38.140
doesn't allow that.

34:39.100 --> 34:41.540
So it seems that scientism is the problem.

34:41.540 --> 34:44.940
And okay, I'm thinking how are we gonna do this?

34:44.940 --> 34:46.700
So I wanna get to,

34:46.700 --> 34:50.220
because I think this perfectly connects to your,

34:50.220 --> 34:53.620
not your paper, but the article you wrote on Epoch Magazine,

34:53.620 --> 34:58.180
which was the structure of meaning and experience,

34:58.220 --> 35:02.020
rediscovering that which has been lost, that article.

35:03.060 --> 35:06.620
But we didn't discuss existentialism yet.

35:06.620 --> 35:09.820
So, since we're on the topic of meaning,

35:09.820 --> 35:13.260
maybe we could give like a bit of a prelude

35:13.260 --> 35:15.100
to what existentialism is

35:15.100 --> 35:16.380
and how that pertains to meaning

35:16.380 --> 35:18.020
and then we'll get to your article,

35:18.020 --> 35:20.340
because if not, I feel like we're gonna get carried away.

35:20.340 --> 35:23.100
I also have a few more questions about Heidegger,

35:23.100 --> 35:26.100
but I certainly wanna discuss what you've written.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.580
So Jacob, like maybe we'll start with existentialism

35:28.580 --> 35:31.660
and then we'll move on to your article, if that's all right.

35:34.660 --> 35:39.660
So I understand existentialism as a philosophical study

35:39.700 --> 35:43.540
of the human condition and all of its guts and glory,

35:43.540 --> 35:48.540
because I say that because a lot of existentialism

35:49.100 --> 35:52.340
is around kind of gutsy topics like death

35:52.420 --> 35:57.340
and it can seem kind of dark,

35:57.340 --> 35:58.260
especially when we're talking about things

35:58.260 --> 36:03.220
like anxiety and dread, but it's really,

36:03.220 --> 36:05.540
it's just an attempt to try to understand

36:05.540 --> 36:09.980
the human condition and all of its facets.

36:09.980 --> 36:13.380
I mean, so we have the human as the essential subject

36:13.380 --> 36:16.180
and not just like the biological human

36:16.180 --> 36:18.560
or the physical human, but more than that,

36:18.560 --> 36:23.040
we have the experiencing human.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.480
And so, I mean, we can see already

36:24.480 --> 36:27.000
how it can connect up with phenomenology nicely.

36:27.960 --> 36:31.840
But I mean, the existentialists are gonna ponder questions,

36:31.840 --> 36:34.240
like what does it mean to live and die?

36:36.440 --> 36:38.360
What should I be doing with my life?

36:39.500 --> 36:40.720
Should I act responsibly?

36:40.720 --> 36:42.640
Do I have, what kind of freedom do I have?

36:42.640 --> 36:43.800
Do I have any freedom?

36:45.240 --> 36:46.160
What does death mean?

36:46.160 --> 36:47.160
Is there meaning in life?

36:47.160 --> 36:49.440
Is everything just meaningless?

36:49.440 --> 36:54.440
So, I guess very human questions

36:55.920 --> 36:59.320
that most of us have probably thought about at some point.

37:01.520 --> 37:06.360
And it's approached in a rigorous manner, though.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.960
So I guess that's what makes it,

37:07.960 --> 37:12.960
I feel like thinking about these things in a loose manner.

37:13.960 --> 37:17.080
So it's approaching these very human clashes

37:17.080 --> 37:19.040
in a more rigorous manner.

37:19.880 --> 37:23.040
Yeah, what's interesting is we've got colloquial terms

37:23.040 --> 37:27.880
such as existential dread or existential crisis.

37:27.880 --> 37:30.360
It seems like those terms wouldn't even exist

37:30.360 --> 37:34.160
if not for the existentialists themselves

37:34.160 --> 37:35.880
writing about these topics.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.800
And even with an existentialism,

37:38.800 --> 37:40.800
it's starting from caricature to nature

37:41.160 --> 37:44.000
to the French existentialist or, of course, Heidegger,

37:44.000 --> 37:45.520
which is why, you know,

37:45.520 --> 37:47.840
what probably perhaps what makes philosophy interesting,

37:47.840 --> 37:50.960
you can never say this is what existentialism is, right?

37:50.960 --> 37:55.200
It's the thinkers themselves don't agree with each other.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.960
And in fact, people such as Camus,

37:56.960 --> 37:59.600
who we would think as an existentialist,

37:59.600 --> 38:00.760
rejected that term.

38:01.680 --> 38:05.080
But I think you put it best check.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.840
The way I think about it is that

38:06.840 --> 38:09.120
it's the ultimate human questions,

38:09.120 --> 38:11.880
leaving aside obstruous detached metaphysics

38:11.880 --> 38:15.200
and coming back to our human experience.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.880
And that, speaking about experience,

38:16.880 --> 38:19.600
that leads us to your article.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.440
So I'll reread the title,

38:21.440 --> 38:23.960
The Structure of Meaning and Experience.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.440
By the way, not to fatter you too much,

38:26.440 --> 38:28.080
you are a brilliant writer, mate.

38:28.080 --> 38:30.880
I aspire to write like you one day,

38:30.880 --> 38:33.920
especially on such obstruous topics.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.200
It's well written, it's well written.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.120
Thank you.

38:38.120 --> 38:39.760
The structure of meaning experience,

38:39.760 --> 38:42.520
we discovering that which has been lost.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.880
So obviously I read the article,

38:44.880 --> 38:47.960
but for let's say for anyone who hasn't read it,

38:47.960 --> 38:51.560
maybe give a bit of a summary

38:51.560 --> 38:52.920
of what you were trying to cover

38:52.920 --> 38:55.200
and convey in this article.

38:55.200 --> 38:58.120
Obviously all the links down below the description.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.920
And this one's on Epoch Magazine.

39:02.120 --> 39:07.120
Yeah, so I will preface what I'm going to say

39:07.960 --> 39:12.960
with the very honest answer that,

39:14.040 --> 39:15.720
honest comments that I'm a better writer

39:15.720 --> 39:16.560
than a speaker.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.600
So if you're listening to this

39:17.600 --> 39:19.440
and I sound like I'm all over the place,

39:19.440 --> 39:24.280
I would ask if you read some of my papers and articles,

39:24.280 --> 39:25.240
it might make more sense.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.000
I could be all over the place when I talk.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.320
Okay, so anyway, so in that article,

39:33.120 --> 39:36.080
you know, it was one of the first articles,

39:36.560 --> 39:37.640
I guess not one of the first,

39:37.640 --> 39:39.040
but one of the first that I published

39:39.040 --> 39:41.920
about meaning and meaningfulness.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.480
And I was really trying to work out in that article,

39:44.480 --> 39:46.480
kind of what my own perspective was on it

39:46.480 --> 39:48.280
and how I wanted to communicate

39:48.280 --> 39:50.360
what I was thinking about meaning.

39:52.440 --> 39:56.040
And so I really liked that article for that reason

39:56.040 --> 40:01.040
because I think it's almost like a foundational piece

40:01.880 --> 40:06.880
of writing that shows me the direction that I need to go

40:07.320 --> 40:10.640
and to try to illuminate these ideas a little bit more.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.880
But in general, what I'm doing in the article

40:13.880 --> 40:18.520
is trying to go through and talk about

40:18.520 --> 40:23.080
where we can find meaning and experience as it's experienced.

40:23.080 --> 40:26.360
And so I'm not appealing to analytic arguments

40:26.360 --> 40:29.640
to try to convince you that meaning is real in that article,

40:29.680 --> 40:31.960
which is what a lot of analytical philosophy is.

40:31.960 --> 40:36.760
It's kind of creating a coherent argument

40:36.760 --> 40:39.520
to try to convince or persuade someone

40:39.520 --> 40:43.040
that something is true and they're often very isolated.

40:43.040 --> 40:46.080
I try to take a holistic and phenomenological approach.

40:46.080 --> 40:49.120
And so I'm trying to point to certain experiences

40:49.120 --> 40:51.880
where I think people have found meaning

40:51.880 --> 40:53.680
and where I have personally found meaning

40:53.680 --> 40:56.320
and where people that I've talked to have said,

40:56.320 --> 40:58.480
yeah, I find this really meaningful.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.760
I've been trying to talk about the structures

40:59.760 --> 41:03.480
of that a little bit and also eliminating those structures

41:03.480 --> 41:08.480
also means describing what's necessary in the experience

41:12.040 --> 41:14.000
or what might be necessary in the experience

41:14.000 --> 41:17.120
for it to be a truly meaningful experience.

41:18.880 --> 41:23.120
And I'll leave the introduction to that at that

41:23.120 --> 41:25.360
and then see what questions you might wanna ask.

41:25.360 --> 41:26.200
Sure.

41:28.040 --> 41:30.720
So, you know, meaning seems again,

41:30.720 --> 41:33.680
like one of those terms like consciousness,

41:33.680 --> 41:36.920
which is, it seems to be a bit of a loaded term, isn't it?

41:36.920 --> 41:40.880
So what for you is a meaningful life?

41:43.480 --> 41:46.600
So I like to, so like you said,

41:46.600 --> 41:51.600
it's a meaning is a very obscure and ambiguous term.

41:52.600 --> 41:56.600
And I like to link, I like to link this back to,

41:59.880 --> 42:01.600
was it a priori or a gust, I think it was a gust,

42:01.600 --> 42:03.400
that said something about time.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.800
I know what time is and so somebody asked me what it is.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.800
And then when I'm asked, you know, I really,

42:09.800 --> 42:12.120
I can't figure it out, I can't give a description

42:12.120 --> 42:13.720
or I can't explain what time is.

42:15.720 --> 42:19.520
Or you could say, or you could say meaning is like pornography.

42:19.560 --> 42:21.480
He knew it when you see it.

42:21.480 --> 42:22.680
You know when you see it.

42:22.680 --> 42:23.880
Yeah, I mean, you know, actually,

42:23.880 --> 42:27.640
I think that's a great, a great, a great,

42:30.000 --> 42:33.200
I purposefully did not give an analytic definition

42:33.200 --> 42:37.360
of meaning in that article or really in any paper of,

42:37.360 --> 42:41.480
because I think giving a definition of it

42:41.480 --> 42:44.480
is kind of doing an injustice to it

42:44.480 --> 42:47.280
because it's a sort of thing.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.840
So you have to experience it.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.360
So you know it when you feel it,

42:50.360 --> 42:53.120
you know it when you experience it.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.680
And so that's another reason why,

42:55.680 --> 42:58.040
rather than try to tell people what meaning is,

42:58.040 --> 42:59.520
for me, a meaningful life.

42:59.520 --> 43:03.200
And I will say that I,

43:04.400 --> 43:06.760
relative, not subjective, but relative,

43:06.760 --> 43:08.840
and I think there's a very important difference.

43:08.840 --> 43:11.680
It's gonna be relative to each of our personal existences

43:11.680 --> 43:16.680
and that we find value in the things

43:17.680 --> 43:20.000
that make us feel purpose,

43:20.000 --> 43:20.840
the things that sort of,

43:20.840 --> 43:23.160
the things that like to vitalize us,

43:23.160 --> 43:24.600
give us vitality, give us,

43:26.600 --> 43:30.280
almost as zest, you know, as zest for life.

43:31.360 --> 43:35.500
That I like to point to as indicators of meaning.

43:35.500 --> 43:39.080
For me, a meaningful life is doing philosophy and writing

43:39.080 --> 43:42.480
and having a few close friendships

43:42.520 --> 43:46.800
and having a loving family.

43:46.800 --> 43:50.400
And I think all of these things are important

43:50.400 --> 43:51.960
for a holistic meaning.

43:51.960 --> 43:55.200
Now, in the article that we're talking about right now,

43:55.200 --> 43:57.360
I focused in on one type of meaning

43:57.360 --> 44:00.520
because I think it's the easiest to point to an experience

44:00.520 --> 44:02.880
and that's like a passionate activity.

44:02.880 --> 44:06.600
So I use the artist as an example in that article.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.360
But it could just as well be a scientist,

44:09.360 --> 44:12.280
it could just as well be a philosopher, a writer.

44:13.640 --> 44:16.440
You know, I don't think you can put a limitation

44:16.440 --> 44:18.120
on what sort of activities are meaningful

44:18.120 --> 44:21.360
because that would just be quite absurd

44:21.360 --> 44:24.080
because I'm sure somebody finds something very meaningful

44:24.080 --> 44:26.760
that I would absolutely dread doing.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.560
And actually I know that's the case.

44:29.560 --> 44:33.160
And so it's gonna be relative.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.640
So I can say what's meaningful for me

44:35.640 --> 44:38.640
and I can try to describe what's meaningful

44:40.360 --> 44:41.400
for other people.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.480
Not in the sense that I'm gonna tell you

44:45.480 --> 44:46.640
what you're gonna find meaningful

44:46.640 --> 44:48.920
but in the sense that this person

44:48.920 --> 44:53.920
that has practiced a specific discipline,

44:54.320 --> 44:57.360
a specific art maybe for their entire lives

44:57.360 --> 45:02.360
and it's kind of like what they breathe and live

45:04.440 --> 45:07.000
and it's their guiding passion.

45:07.360 --> 45:10.240
I mean, I think that's a very good indicator

45:10.240 --> 45:13.080
that they're finding something incredibly meaningful

45:13.080 --> 45:14.360
about that endeavor.

45:17.040 --> 45:20.900
And meaning certainly is not the same as happiness.

45:22.520 --> 45:25.080
There's a lot of times where I'm writing

45:25.080 --> 45:27.160
and studying philosophy where I'm not getting

45:27.160 --> 45:31.480
some sort of immediate happy feeling from it

45:31.480 --> 45:33.000
or pleasure out of it.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.800
Sometimes it's very difficult and frustrating

45:36.800 --> 45:41.080
but there's maybe a transcendent value that

45:44.200 --> 45:46.960
I guess to use it, I'm gonna use the phrase

45:46.960 --> 45:50.000
that you used last time we chatted.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.400
It's soul edified, it lifts the spirit

45:54.400 --> 45:58.480
in a way that is distinct from happiness and pleasure.

46:00.440 --> 46:03.720
But it's a passion.

46:07.160 --> 46:09.640
Yeah, I'll just say, I'll leave it at that.

46:09.640 --> 46:12.600
Yeah, because I mean, look, passions, it's an amazing,

46:12.600 --> 46:16.120
I in fact have a question, not pertaining to this article

46:16.120 --> 46:19.080
but one of your other papers where in fact

46:19.080 --> 46:21.640
you've used the word passion extensively,

46:22.920 --> 46:25.360
the title of the papers.

46:25.360 --> 46:28.560
You said that this is gonna be published soon in a,

46:28.560 --> 46:31.000
so sorry, let me read out the title first,

46:31.000 --> 46:34.720
passion as a disclosure of meaningfulness in life.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.440
This hasn't been published yet, isn't it?

46:36.440 --> 46:39.960
You said it's gonna be published in a journal soon.

46:39.960 --> 46:41.440
So that paper is still in review.

46:41.440 --> 46:44.960
I have not gotten a communication as to whether it will be

46:44.960 --> 46:49.960
published or not, the ontology of meaning paper,

46:52.960 --> 46:55.240
that one's gonna be published in

46:55.240 --> 46:57.480
Countess Journal of Philosophy in 2023.

46:57.480 --> 46:59.120
Sure, sure, sure.

46:59.120 --> 47:01.280
But maybe if people are interested,

47:01.280 --> 47:05.520
they could probably tweet at you if you don't mind of course

47:05.560 --> 47:07.400
and if they're interested in reading the paper,

47:07.400 --> 47:08.480
because I don't wanna leave it,

47:08.480 --> 47:09.560
because then I'll publish it,

47:09.560 --> 47:11.560
I'm not gonna share them publicly.

47:11.560 --> 47:14.280
Sure, yeah, someone's interested.

47:14.280 --> 47:17.000
So yeah, I can't really circulate it

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
until I really have a decision from the journal,

47:22.960 --> 47:24.800
but if anybody's interested in reading it

47:24.800 --> 47:26.080
or looking over it or discussing it,

47:26.080 --> 47:30.240
definitely reach out, I can send a PDF copy.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.080
Yep, great.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.600
All right, so meaning,

47:33.600 --> 47:36.280
this probably leads us to

47:36.280 --> 47:38.560
a bit of a Hadegarian question.

47:38.560 --> 47:40.520
I was gonna discuss Hadegar separately,

47:40.520 --> 47:43.680
but why discuss Hadegar abstractly?

47:43.680 --> 47:45.320
He himself wouldn't like that.

47:45.320 --> 47:46.880
Let's connect it to your work.

47:48.240 --> 47:53.240
You've said that we live in a techno-scientific era

47:55.800 --> 47:59.520
and you said that we are attempting to take a view

47:59.520 --> 48:01.560
from nowhere in the modern world.

48:02.560 --> 48:05.760
And when I read that bit,

48:05.760 --> 48:07.280
I was even trying to connect that

48:07.280 --> 48:12.280
to kind of this modern new age obsession with stoicism,

48:12.360 --> 48:15.880
where it seems that everyone talks a lot about stoicism

48:15.880 --> 48:17.480
being detached from the world.

48:18.560 --> 48:21.160
And I don't know if that tightly correlates

48:21.160 --> 48:23.520
to this idea of the view from nowhere.

48:23.520 --> 48:26.000
Everything is just a cosmic phenomenon.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.480
Nothing really matters in some sense, ultimately.

48:29.400 --> 48:34.400
So I placed this question in two parts, Jacob.

48:35.600 --> 48:40.600
Firstly, ultimately, what was Hadegar struggling with?

48:41.160 --> 48:44.280
What was he trying to figure out in his work

48:44.280 --> 48:45.760
and what were his concerns?

48:45.760 --> 48:47.720
For instance, like in the essay,

48:47.720 --> 48:51.840
a question concerning technology, essays like that.

48:51.840 --> 48:55.600
And the second part of the question is, from his work,

48:55.640 --> 48:58.640
how does that pertain to the question of meaning

48:58.640 --> 49:00.120
and human experience?

49:03.240 --> 49:08.240
So there is very upfront about the question

49:10.600 --> 49:14.320
that he's asking, and it's, what is the meaning of being?

49:14.320 --> 49:17.240
And that's so vague that nobody can get an idea

49:17.240 --> 49:18.680
of what it is until they've read the whole book.

49:18.680 --> 49:22.400
And then maybe you can understand the question after that.

49:22.400 --> 49:25.800
But he's really just asking, in what sense,

49:25.800 --> 49:28.240
in what sense do things exist?

49:28.240 --> 49:31.600
I mean, that's kind of what he's asking.

49:31.600 --> 49:34.000
Maybe an easier way to understand the question.

49:35.520 --> 49:38.680
And so he asks this question,

49:40.240 --> 49:42.560
and he says that we've, the tradition

49:42.560 --> 49:46.040
has really forgotten about being and what being is.

49:46.040 --> 49:50.040
And for Hadegar, and this is gonna kind of

49:50.040 --> 49:52.800
come back around to his approach to phenomenology

49:52.800 --> 49:56.080
as far as the idea that he thinks phenomenology should

49:59.120 --> 50:04.120
discover or disclose the apriori structures of existence.

50:04.840 --> 50:08.240
And so being for Hadegar is synonymous

50:08.240 --> 50:13.080
with the apriori ontological structures of existence.

50:13.080 --> 50:17.720
So the structures of experience and existence

50:17.720 --> 50:21.000
that are necessary for us to be having the experience

50:21.000 --> 50:22.400
that we're having right now.

50:26.480 --> 50:31.480
And this is, so we can contrast this with science,

50:33.880 --> 50:38.160
most certainly, and also traditional philosophy,

50:38.160 --> 50:40.040
because traditional philosophy and science

50:40.040 --> 50:44.280
is kind of working in this subject-object sort of framework,

50:44.320 --> 50:47.080
and they're also working within mostly

50:47.080 --> 50:49.400
a substance-based framework.

50:49.400 --> 50:53.600
So we have a substance, so we have objects,

50:53.600 --> 50:56.400
and objects are made out of a substance.

50:56.400 --> 50:58.560
And what kind of properties does these objects have?

50:58.560 --> 51:02.720
And this is another reason, I mean, and this is direct.

51:02.720 --> 51:05.000
The reason why he was so against Descartes

51:05.000 --> 51:07.280
and had a lot of criticisms of Descartes,

51:07.280 --> 51:09.720
because Descartes is kind of perpetuating

51:09.720 --> 51:12.920
these philosophical assumptions that he thinks

51:12.920 --> 51:15.040
that Hadegar thinks are completely unfounded,

51:15.040 --> 51:19.480
such as, I mean, what is it to be,

51:19.480 --> 51:21.080
like what is the human person,

51:21.080 --> 51:26.080
and Descartes's gonna say this immaterial consciousness,

51:26.080 --> 51:27.520
that's the person.

51:27.520 --> 51:30.880
So we're a substance, where he's bringing us back

51:31.960 --> 51:35.640
to the substance-based sort of metaphysics.

51:35.640 --> 51:38.920
Hadegar basically says, no, this is all wrong.

51:38.920 --> 51:41.240
We need to look at being, and we can't look at being

51:41.240 --> 51:43.400
when we're trying to look at objects and the properties,

51:43.400 --> 51:48.400
because in order for us to even look at objects

51:49.080 --> 51:50.960
in their property, so in a sense,

51:50.960 --> 51:53.760
in order to even have an empirical science

51:53.760 --> 51:57.080
that can try to discern properties

51:57.080 --> 51:59.200
of certain substances and certain objects,

52:00.280 --> 52:03.520
we need all these other things already in place,

52:03.520 --> 52:04.920
and that's what he's pointing to

52:04.920 --> 52:06.800
with the aphriora structures.

52:09.320 --> 52:11.080
And so that's kind of what Hadegar is up to,

52:11.120 --> 52:12.520
in being in time, really.

52:13.480 --> 52:18.480
And he's gonna say that we're sense-making beings.

52:18.640 --> 52:22.040
I mean, we make sense out of all of our experiences,

52:23.360 --> 52:28.360
and he goes through in very complex detail

52:32.000 --> 52:33.120
what these structures are,

52:33.120 --> 52:37.400
and kind of what the holistic structure of them is.

52:37.400 --> 52:40.320
And so we have feeling, I mean, we have a thinless sky,

52:40.320 --> 52:42.920
and that's one of the important things for my work

52:42.920 --> 52:45.520
that I take from Hadegar is this idea that,

52:47.240 --> 52:50.520
and the thinless sky is often translated as attunement.

52:50.520 --> 52:52.800
And the popular translation is translated as state of mind,

52:52.800 --> 52:54.200
but it's a very terrible translation

52:54.200 --> 52:57.720
because Hadegar wanted nothing to do with states of mind.

52:57.720 --> 53:00.520
And so attunement might be a better word for now.

53:00.520 --> 53:02.160
Some people like to use this position,

53:02.160 --> 53:05.920
but it's really just the way you find yourself in the world.

53:05.920 --> 53:07.280
How are you attuned to the world?

53:07.280 --> 53:12.280
And it has connotations of feelings and emotions

53:12.600 --> 53:14.520
and that sort of thing.

53:15.920 --> 53:20.520
And so that's just one of many apriori structures

53:20.520 --> 53:23.640
that Hadegar is gonna talk about being attached.

53:23.640 --> 53:26.800
And how does, okay, so first question is,

53:28.040 --> 53:32.200
we talk about Hadegar's idea that we are being in the world,

53:32.200 --> 53:34.760
and he's trying to make the statement that,

53:34.760 --> 53:39.240
in fact, before we even think of our states of mind,

53:39.240 --> 53:41.200
our conscious experience,

53:41.200 --> 53:43.680
there are all these other structures

53:43.680 --> 53:45.200
that presuppose all of that.

53:45.200 --> 53:47.280
For us to even ask that question,

53:47.280 --> 53:49.120
what is existence, what is consciousness?

53:49.120 --> 53:51.640
There are many other things that come before that.

53:51.640 --> 53:53.680
And is that what he kind of means by,

53:53.680 --> 53:55.600
we are, obviously we're embodied beings,

53:55.600 --> 53:59.480
but we're also in the world amongst other beings.

53:59.480 --> 54:03.240
Yes, so being in the world, and it's all hyphenated.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.640
So if somebody's listening and they haven't seen

54:05.640 --> 54:08.000
the phrase written out in his book,

54:08.000 --> 54:12.720
being hyphened in hyphened the hyphenate world is one.

54:12.720 --> 54:15.400
And it's done that way because what Hadegar's trying

54:15.400 --> 54:18.840
to signify with that is a unitary phenomenon.

54:18.840 --> 54:23.840
He's trying to say, all of this comes together.

54:24.080 --> 54:28.040
It's all codependent, it's an interdependent phenomenon.

54:28.040 --> 54:32.720
We don't first exist and then try to find the world.

54:32.720 --> 54:35.120
And our world doesn't first exist,

54:35.120 --> 54:37.520
and then we kind of come into it.

54:38.920 --> 54:43.440
But there's a interdependence and kind of co-manifestation

54:43.440 --> 54:46.760
of existence and what he means by world.

54:46.760 --> 54:49.440
And that's what being in the world is.

54:49.440 --> 54:53.400
And so it's a holistic and interdependent sort of thing.

54:57.120 --> 55:00.800
So if you look at how that pertains to meaning,

55:01.800 --> 55:05.000
firstly, this is something I've struggled with.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.600
For Hadegar, it seems like there's a world of facts,

55:08.600 --> 55:12.520
but for the world to become true,

55:12.520 --> 55:16.040
for those facts to have a truthfulness,

55:16.040 --> 55:18.720
it requires a Dasein or a human being.

55:18.720 --> 55:20.760
Dasein is the term he uses.

55:20.760 --> 55:23.600
So then would he say that in some sense,

55:23.600 --> 55:28.320
reality truly became reality as we know it now,

55:28.320 --> 55:33.000
only after we came into being, we came to exist

55:33.000 --> 55:34.720
and we were being in the world?

55:35.760 --> 55:39.360
Or is that something he doesn't really talk about too much?

55:39.360 --> 55:41.120
So he doesn't talk about it a whole lot.

55:41.120 --> 55:43.600
There are some very, very difficult passages

55:43.600 --> 55:48.040
that are still disputed today.

55:48.040 --> 55:50.200
And I've had a lot of fun conversations

55:50.200 --> 55:52.680
about these passages because they are very difficult

55:52.680 --> 55:55.920
to try to discern what the heck he was meaning.

55:55.920 --> 55:59.600
He also uses the word world

55:59.600 --> 56:02.440
in three or four different ways in being in time,

56:02.440 --> 56:04.640
but he's very precise about when he uses them

56:04.640 --> 56:06.480
and he even tells you beforehand,

56:06.480 --> 56:08.480
like if it's in quotes, this is what it means.

56:08.480 --> 56:11.560
If it's capitalized, this is what it means.

56:11.560 --> 56:15.120
So he has a good system.

56:15.120 --> 56:20.120
He's not just erratic in throwing these words out there.

56:20.320 --> 56:21.600
He knows what he means by them

56:21.600 --> 56:24.680
and he tries to convey to us what he's meaning by them.

56:25.680 --> 56:29.000
But to get back to your question,

56:29.960 --> 56:33.400
yeah, in a very real way, what Heidegger is saying is,

56:36.520 --> 56:40.120
reality as we know it, the world as we experience it,

56:41.160 --> 56:43.640
the world as we articulate it,

56:43.640 --> 56:46.400
whether that's in, you know, as facts or not,

56:49.760 --> 56:53.560
only has been, it only is when Dazan is.

56:55.360 --> 56:59.320
And the question arises, well,

56:59.320 --> 57:03.200
if all human existence was to kind of fade out overnight

57:03.200 --> 57:04.920
where the world disappeared

57:04.920 --> 57:06.120
or whether there's still the world

57:06.120 --> 57:08.120
or whether there's still the entities,

57:08.120 --> 57:08.960
that sort of thing.

57:08.960 --> 57:13.960
And Heidegger stays true to the phenomenological approach here

57:15.640 --> 57:20.120
and he stays true to it in some other areas as well.

57:20.120 --> 57:21.560
And what I mean by that is,

57:22.560 --> 57:24.920
he doesn't give a definitive answer.

57:24.920 --> 57:27.920
He kind of just says, well, if we're not here,

57:27.920 --> 57:30.120
we don't really know what would be here.

57:31.960 --> 57:36.200
So because phenomenology is looking to experience,

57:36.200 --> 57:40.680
he can't make a phenomenological judgment about that.

57:41.600 --> 57:43.680
And he is honest about that.

57:43.680 --> 57:46.120
And then something that I appreciate about his approach

57:46.120 --> 57:51.120
is that he doesn't overstep the limits of the method

57:51.360 --> 57:52.200
that he's using.

57:53.600 --> 57:58.600
And I mean, philosophy has argued about that forever,

57:59.520 --> 58:01.960
whether the world exists independently or not.

58:01.960 --> 58:04.600
And what Heidegger just says as well,

58:04.600 --> 58:07.080
as far as our experience goes,

58:09.800 --> 58:13.360
and as far as the way we articulate the meaning of being,

58:15.720 --> 58:17.720
being only is while we are.

58:17.720 --> 58:22.720
And it's obscure and it's sometimes frustrating

58:23.080 --> 58:26.040
if you want a concrete answer

58:27.080 --> 58:30.760
as to the independence or not of the world.

58:30.760 --> 58:33.560
But he just kind of then follows up by saying,

58:33.560 --> 58:36.920
well, if we're not here, we're not really gonna know.

58:36.920 --> 58:40.160
And I don't think anybody's had an experience

58:41.360 --> 58:42.360
absent the world.

58:42.360 --> 58:45.600
And so I don't think anybody knows

58:45.600 --> 58:47.320
what the answer to that is.

58:49.040 --> 58:52.600
And so it's, to me, okay, so to me,

58:52.600 --> 58:56.200
I appreciate the enigma, I appreciate the mystery behind it

58:56.200 --> 58:59.760
because if we truly can't know,

58:59.760 --> 59:03.360
maybe we can think through it and have a discourse about it

59:03.360 --> 59:08.360
and it might be a very meaningful sort of thing

59:09.720 --> 59:12.800
to talk about, but because we can't know,

59:12.800 --> 59:15.040
we shouldn't pretend that we know.

59:16.360 --> 59:21.360
Yeah, or, I mean, perhaps it even,

59:21.720 --> 59:24.880
in some sense, Hattaker probably wouldn't even like us

59:24.880 --> 59:28.720
just talking too abstractly about such things,

59:28.720 --> 59:30.600
given that, again, like you said,

59:30.600 --> 59:35.600
he would want us to stick to the phenomenological approach

59:35.600 --> 59:38.080
where we're talking about structures of experience.

59:38.080 --> 59:41.200
And for starters, if there aren't any structures,

59:41.200 --> 59:44.040
there are some conversations we can't have

59:44.400 --> 59:47.920
whereas at one point, it just becomes the term you use,

59:47.920 --> 59:50.640
which I know is by Wittgenstein's language games.

59:50.640 --> 59:54.640
At one point, which is why sometimes I think of

59:54.640 --> 59:58.640
all these pop philosophy or pop science ideas,

59:58.640 --> 01:00:03.640
like the many worlds theory or brain in a bat or what else?

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.920
Do we live in a matrix?

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.920
They really seem like futile or even useless efforts

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.880
or conversations to have because, again,

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.360
it doesn't pertain to a palpable actual experience.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.480
It's just fully abstract.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.640
And again, nothing wrong with abstracts.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.240
Mathematics is fully abstract,

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.120
but look at how useful mathematics is.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.120
But I'll get your point.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.560
I think you explained quite well.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:37.560
So Hattaker's idea of being in the world,

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.960
how does that relate to what you've discussed here?

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.280
Firstly, meaning and then,

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.560
well, perhaps more, more specifically, human meaning.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.000
Sure.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.320
Yeah, and so I will also clarify

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.040
since you added that caveat on at the end there,

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.280
I really only talked about meaning in relation to,

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.520
I have to pretend to humans,

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.920
meaning in the lives of humans.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.440
I don't know if I'll ever transcend that

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.400
and talk about meaning as such,

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.480
but again, maybe that's not a phenomenologically appropriate

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.000
topic because I don't know,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.040
outside of my human experience,

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.360
I don't know what meaning might be.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.880
But so being in the world,

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.320
I think it kind of at least starts to give us,

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.560
well, for one, that's gonna be after you are a structure

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.640
to having an experience of meaning.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.200
I mean, we're in the world,

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.280
not in a sort of container-like way,

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.880
like water is in the glass,

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:55.880
but we're the world and us are co-constituted in a sense.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.680
And we have to,

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.800
I'm trying to think about how I want to phrase this.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.840
I guess we have to involve ourselves in the world,

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.160
like we're always being in the world,

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.000
whenever abstracted away from the world

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.880
or else we wouldn't be living in,

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.040
where it would be an existing being.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.800
So it's not that we're never not being in the world,

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.240
but I think it kind of points to this idea

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.240
that us in the world are closer than we think

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.960
and we're more interconnected than we think.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.520
And if we sort of explore with,

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.400
we sort of explore the world

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.880
and various involvements that we might have with it,

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.120
we might stumble across something

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.320
that we find extremely meaningful.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.840
And I think that's really the only way

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.480
that we can discover meaning.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.360
I don't think we subjectively create meaning,

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.480
but I don't think meaning is also just objectively

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.320
out there in the world.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.440
I think it's a relational phenomenon.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.640
So I guess that the concept of being in the world

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:07.120
also points to that idea that it's a interdependent

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.480
and relational sort of thing.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.160
And we might also, in the process,

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.240
discover a lot of things that we don't like

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.720
and that we don't find meaningful

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.320
or we find the opposite there that we find meaningless.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.240
But I think that's also just closer

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.560
to what we find meaningful

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.640
because you don't really know until you have the experience.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.600
You don't really know until you involve yourself

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.840
in the activity or what have you.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.800
And so it's an experiential relational thing

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.800
and being in the world is kind of just a necessary structure

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.600
for us to be able to go out there and try to find meaning.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.880
If we weren't being in the world,

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.080
we were not existing.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.600
That's well put.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.520
That is well, I think you hit the nail on the head there.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.200
So being in the world is, in fact,

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.320
what's necessary to even discover meaning.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.560
Okay, okay.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.440
Because another thing I realized

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.000
was perhaps one of the most important things

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.360
Jerome Reiki did

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.600
to the contemporary philosophical conversation

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.840
is that he started asking the question

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.120
from meaning of life to meaning in life.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.200
And Heidegger would probably fall on the latter camp

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.040
where what he worries about

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.240
or his concerns are meaning in life.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.520
For him, meaning of life is again,

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.000
one of those useless questions.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.440
Yeah, and you know, Heidegger uses the term meaning a lot

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.640
but he generally, what he means by that

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.320
is generally the way in which I just used it,

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.080
like the sense that something has,

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.120
making sense of something.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.400
So the German term that he uses a lot of sin,

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.080
S-I-N-N, and it can be translated as meaning

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.200
but it can also be translated as sense.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:12.080
So Heidegger doesn't really talk about meaning in life

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.240
as much as like making sense of things in life

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.240
and making sense of the world.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.160
And that's another reason why I thought that

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.040
because I think Heidegger gets a lot of things right.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.360
I think he gets a lot of things correct

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.960
with his fundamental analysis.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.440
And it's very like the fundamental structures

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.800
that he's laying out seem,

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.760
something seems true about them.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:37.280
And so because of that,

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.440
and because he doesn't really talk about meaning in life,

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:45.560
I thought his framework would be a really great framework

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:49.000
to take over and to try to talk about meaning

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.880
from within that existential framework

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.000
because it is phenomenological.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.960
It is an experiential sort of phenomenon, meaning is.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.360
And so almost,

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.600
I guess taking what Heidegger has done

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.400
and adding something to it,

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:12.440
it's kind of what in a sense I'm doing.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.480
Yeah.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.840
Yeah, like all great thinkers, isn't it?

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.320
Because Heidegger himself,

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.960
even though he was trying to subvert whole of philosophy,

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.320
he still was working off,

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:27.640
like Aristotle or Kant or some great thinkers of the past.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.840
Okay, so this,

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:34.160
I want to read out an excerpt from your essay.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.880
The reason being,

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.520
I think the way you've put it here very much pertains to,

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.520
so firstly, this is a small statement you've made

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.960
in regarding apropos time

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.440
and you've discussed how time would differ

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:53.080
for a phenomenologist from, let's say, a scientist.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.680
And then you put and you've written

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:59.680
and you've quoted Heidegger in that statement you've made.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.080
And I think that statement itself

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.040
is more of like a sobered example as to,

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.240
it probably answers a lot of questions

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.400
that we were discussing, for example,

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.120
the difference between phenomenology and science

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.240
or if there is this stark difference

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.160
and then how that relates to meaning and whatnot.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.040
So firstly, I'll read out the statement

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.680
and then I'll ask the question.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.560
So here's what you've stated, Jacob.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.920
For Martin Heidegger,

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.440
past events are always projected into the future,

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:35.480
while also existing presently as having been.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:40.160
The future is not later than having been

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:43.080
and having been is not earlier than the present.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.280
What was having been arises simultaneously

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.600
with the present and the future

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.920
and human being is always towards,

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.240
toward itself in anticipation of the possible ways of being.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.240
The Heideggerian concept of time

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.120
frees the phenomenologists from thinking

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.200
of past, present and future

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.400
as sequentially ordered groupings of distinct events.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:16.240
So saying that, how does a phenomenologist

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.960
or a Heideggerian view time and meaning

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:23.040
and how that pertains to a human being

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.160
from let's say an analytical philosopher or a scientist?

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.960
So a common theme in Heidegger

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:38.960
is this idea of primordial phenomenon and deriving.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:43.040
You may have to explain that term, primordial phenomenon.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.760
So basically, what he means by that is

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:53.080
the more basic, more fundamental structure,

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.720
I guess, what you could say.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.560
And because it's a phenomenological structure,

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.000
it's gonna be an experiential thing.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.920
And Heidegger thinks that a lot of the things

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.080
that we have theories for now,

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.400
were derived from something more basic

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.640
that we had an experience.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.800
And time is one of them.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.800
And so like the sort of everyday notion of time that we have,

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.400
which I think at the end of that paragraph

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.560
that you read, kind of talked about it

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.560
as far as like the sequentially ordered groupings of events.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.060
So the idea that there's a future moment,

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.340
that's coming into the present

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:43.140
and then it's going to vanish into the past

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.740
and be gone forever.

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.300
So that's sort of everyday thinking about time and clock time.

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:52.260
Heidegger's gonna refer to as bolder time.

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:55.660
It's a derived mode of time.

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:58.420
It's not the primordial phenomenon of time.

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:05.100
And so he's gonna talk about this more basic idea of time.

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.540
And he's gonna call it temporality talk.

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:12.020
If I say time, think about, let's think about

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.260
our everyday understanding of time.

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:17.260
And if I say, we can't think about Heidegger's idea of time,

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:20.360
it might just be easier for a sake of conversation.

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:26.820
So temporality is obviously very important.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.860
He wrote a book called being and time.

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:35.620
And so the second division of being and time

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:37.700
really dives into the details of that.

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.380
I'm not going to sit here and pretend that I could,

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.500
that I know the exact meaning that Heidegger meant

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.420
with his concept of time or temporality

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:48.300
because it's very complex, very difficult.

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:52.380
But what I can say is that the basic structure,

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:54.980
the basic operator structures that he lays out

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.660
in his existential analysis,

01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:01.660
each pertain to a specific aspect of temporality.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:08.860
So we have understanding as a a priori structure

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:16.780
along with attunement, which I talked about a few moments

01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:18.020
a few minutes ago.

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.820
And he also has fallenness or discourse.

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.340
And basically what Heidegger says

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.940
is that those three things come together

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:35.940
to form the structure of disclosiveness,

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:40.180
the way we disclose the world in a basic way.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.140
And each one of those pertains to a certain aspect of time.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:49.140
And so we have, we're kind of thrown in the world,

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:51.140
we kind of find ourselves in the world

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:57.300
and we have a past that we didn't really choose for ourselves.

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:02.300
And we have the way we find ourselves in the world

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:07.620
within the Skype or attunement,

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:09.020
kind of the way we're currently attuned

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.740
and dealing with the world.

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:14.340
And that's kind of going to point toward the present

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:17.220
and then understanding is pointing towards the future

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:21.460
because understanding, and this is not going to be,

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.460
it's not a cognitive thing.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:26.180
I mean, Heidegger will say that because

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:30.460
theories of cognition are going to come after this.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.940
So again, we're talking about the a priori structures

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:35.380
that are required for you to be able to make up

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:36.620
a theory of cognition.

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.220
And so he doesn't want to,

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.180
he doesn't want people to conflate

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:41.500
what you mean by understanding.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.180
And he gives very specific definitions to all of his terms

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:45.500
and sometimes it's confusing

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:48.260
because we all think we know what we mean by understanding.

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:49.740
So if I could use that.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:54.740
But through the structure and through understanding,

01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:00.500
we find ourselves amongst a whole lot of possibilities

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.300
and we're constantly projecting ourselves

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.860
toward those possibilities,

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:04.900
whether we know it or not,

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.820
whether we're aware of it or not.

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:11.980
And it could be mundane things such as,

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.340
if I stand up right now and I go to walk

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.340
to fill my water,

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.500
I'm going to be using the door handle

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.900
and I'm going to be doing a whole lot of things

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.380
that I'm not really thinking about doing.

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:30.580
But those are all possible modes of comportment,

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.100
possible ways that I can comport myself right now.

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:39.100
So I'm constantly projecting myself into the future.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:43.020
Now to give like, to try to give a better example

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.580
of these three modes come together.

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.420
Maybe we could talk about the harvest.

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:51.420
Yeah, I was just going to ask.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.260
So the three modes, okay.

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:57.660
Let's, how about we try to use the example of the artist

01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:01.460
to expound on what temporality is

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:04.260
and expound on what hiding means by time.

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.460
But then maybe break down,

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:08.460
break down those three modes.

01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.840
Apropos the example of the artist.

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:18.220
So let's just assume that we're talking about

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.780
I'll call them a master artist,

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:29.780
somebody that's practiced for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years,

01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.460
something they've been doing their whole life.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:38.620
They've built up certain habits, right?

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:40.380
I mean, you don't get good at something,

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.900
you don't learn how to paint,

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:43.380
you don't paint your master,

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:48.380
first time you spent decades of time practicing,

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:51.180
making mistakes, and so on.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:56.300
During the time that you're practicing something

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:58.140
and you're trying to master something,

01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:05.020
you're doing that, I mean, so let's say you're,

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.220
somebody's practicing right now,

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:10.620
they're practicing their skill in some art painting.

01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:15.300
And in a very real sense,

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:19.220
the future is co-arising.

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:23.100
And the way in which it's co-arising is

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:30.980
they are cultivating an ability to do something.

01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:34.980
They're expanding the horizon of possibilities

01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:38.260
that they can project themselves upon.

01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:42.660
So through the present moment, the future is co-arising.

01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:45.180
And let's say after they moved in,

01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:50.180
they practiced, now they're the master painter

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:52.660
and they're creating a masterpiece.

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:57.260
In a very real way, their past is co-arising with them

01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:02.260
at that moment in the sense that they have these techniques

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:07.260
and they have a habitual way in which they use a brush

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:10.220
to stroke the canvas.

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:14.780
And they wouldn't have that without their past

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:16.140
practice and discipline.

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:20.180
And so the past is with them at every moment,

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:24.460
that's with us at every moment, in the present moment.

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.660
And then their future continues to co-arise

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:30.980
because they're one brush stroke, two brush strokes,

01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:33.540
it's not their masterpiece yet,

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:37.180
but in the process, the future,

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:39.980
which will be their masterpiece is co-arising,

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:43.700
being made possible through what they're doing right now

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:47.300
and what they're doing right now was only made possible

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:50.980
because of the past, which I'm saying the past,

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.500
but I'm also saying it's still with them

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.780
because it must be or else they wouldn't be a master.

01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:59.220
You can't be a master at something unless you have

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:00.900
gathered up with you,

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:04.820
years and years of practice.

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.740
You're bringing all of this together

01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:09.580
in the present moment in this one.

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.620
Which is why you say that it's not,

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:15.860
in fact, let me read out a small excerpt here.

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:19.420
You say that, during meaningful experience,

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:23.380
this Hedigerian temporality displaces

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:26.180
the vulgar understanding of time

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:28.620
for the latter loses its significance

01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:32.780
when human being is immersed in the world

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:36.500
through passionate, skilled and creative activity

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.540
or during being with others.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:43.140
So the point is, to put it very, very colloquially,

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:46.380
you say, I'm in love with a beautiful woman

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:50.020
or when I'm in this, let's say, flow state or whatever,

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.780
you lose track of time.

01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:57.420
I don't know where time goes and this is the kind of time

01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:59.860
that you're saying Hediger is talking about,

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:03.860
not time in a linear sense where it's t equals zero

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:05.740
and then it goes on from there.

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:09.020
And it's hard for us because what's interesting

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.740
about what I realized about Hediger is that

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.220
once you get it, you get it.

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:15.860
You're like, oh, it's obvious what he's talking about

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:18.180
because it's a part of our experience, isn't it?

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:22.340
But getting it is a hard part because we are so,

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.420
we are so trained or we're so,

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:29.420
let's say attuned to thinking a different way.

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:31.980
So, hmm.

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:35.420
Yeah, I think that's the beautiful thing

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:40.420
about good phenomenology is that when you get it,

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:43.260
you get it in a different way than you get

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.980
a proposition that you're struggling with.

01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:50.980
Maybe you're struggling with this analytic proposition

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:53.780
or this argument and eventually maybe you work it off,

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:54.900
you get it, you understand it

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:57.180
and you're like, okay, cool, I get it.

01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.700
But with phenomenology, I mean,

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.460
a lot of times you do have to struggle with it.

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.820
You have to struggle with Hediger.

01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:04.660
I struggled with him for a very, very long time

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.060
before I understood anything.

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.380
But once you get it, like you said,

01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:12.540
because it is a part of our experience,

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:18.340
you're not just affected cognitively or intellectually

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:22.700
by the understanding because it's deeper than that,

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.820
the understanding, I mean, it feeds back

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:27.540
into Hediger's basic structure that he's talking about.

01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.580
I mean, you feel it, you feel attuned to it.

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:32.860
You say, oh my goodness, like I can see this in my experience.

01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:34.940
You know, like how did I not notice this before?

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.900
Because again, he's pointing,

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.620
he's trying to point to things in experience

01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.140
and there's something very powerful about that,

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.580
in my opinion, over and above something

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.620
that's just propositional that you can't experience

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:48.380
for yourself or you can't notice or reflect on

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:51.220
and say, yes, that is a part of the experience.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:55.420
And it's not surprising that the existentialist,

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:58.580
Sartre, Dibabua, Kamu,

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:01.380
were all heavily influenced by Hediger

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.940
because they were, that was the question

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:05.580
they too were trying to deal with,

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.980
the philosophy they were trying to develop,

01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.180
was it was, well, the word itself is existential.

01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:14.780
There probably isn't any other word to describe it.

01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.300
Fantastic, that was a great explanation,

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:22.700
especially the, I like the analogy of the artist.

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:26.660
In fact, all great, great Hedigerian teachers

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:28.340
or teachers who do teach Hediger,

01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.660
they, like the person that comes from my mind

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:34.900
is one of my intellectual heroes, Hubert Dreyfus.

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:37.340
It's how beautifully he,

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:39.260
he first of all, he's thinking live,

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.660
he's thinking out loud,

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:43.820
but also he always tries to connect it to a phenomena,

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.260
to a phenomenon,

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.620
something that's palpable in our lives.

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.420
How are we going with time, Jacob?

01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:55.100
We're about an hour, 20 minutes

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.100
into the podcast, into the episode.

01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:59.300
Can we do a few more minutes?

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.540
So how are you going with time?

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.180
I'm good on time.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:06.580
Either talking to you today

01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:11.220
or I'm reading and working on the dissertation.

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:14.820
So I have, as long as you are.

01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:16.220
Perfect, I appreciate that, man.

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:17.780
I mean, look, I was thinking,

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.380
as we did discuss before we started recording,

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.580
I don't think we can go to all the questions,

01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.740
everything you've written,

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:28.780
especially probably the paper I like the most by you,

01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:32.780
the reinstatement of existential meaning

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:36.940
or passion as a disclosure of meaningfulness in life.

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.420
That seems a very,

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:43.380
perhaps a very contemporary topic to even talk about

01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:45.740
because passion seems to be something we talk about a lot

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.860
in our culture these days.

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:49.340
It'd be interesting to think of that

01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:50.420
in a phenomenological approach.

01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:51.620
However, saying all that,

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:54.380
I would probably leave that to a whole other episode.

01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:56.900
So let's get to the one that you said

01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:58.620
is a good starting point to your work,

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:00.980
which is your paper,

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:02.460
Ontology of Meaning.

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:07.740
So a lot of questions that I've written down on this.

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:10.620
We touched on a lot of things.

01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:12.820
We spoke about phenomenology for sure.

01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:17.660
How about we talk about something a bit interesting?

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:21.460
Firstly, like we did with the previous paper,

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:23.860
let's just get what you were trying to convey in the paper.

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:26.260
So what did you mean by Ontology of Meaning?

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:29.180
And after that, I want to talk about authenticity

01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:31.660
because it seems like this idea of,

01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.020
just like there's this cliche corporate words

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.060
like bring your authentic self to work

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.700
or be authentic online.

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:41.780
And it's perhaps worth diving into what is authenticity

01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:45.820
from more of an existential phenomenological approach.

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.460
But sorry, I'm getting carried away here.

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:48.980
Before we get there,

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:51.340
your paper, Ontology of Meaning,

01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:53.700
what's the paper about?

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.620
What were you trying to convey?

01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:56.860
And also if you could please,

01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:58.460
where can people find the paper,

01:22:58.460 --> 01:22:59.980
either now or in the future?

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:03.900
Sure, so that paper will be available

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:08.020
in the first quarter of 2023.

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:11.940
That's what I was told the anticipated publication date is.

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:16.940
Basically, they just have to do some formatting

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:20.700
and just wait for the next issue to be published

01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:21.700
and it should be out there

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:24.260
at the Conan Tuss Journal of Philosophy.

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:31.700
So in that paper, it's very apparent.

01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:34.220
I think, is it in the title, Ontology of Meaning?

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:35.460
I've written that paper so long

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.380
that I sometimes I forget what the heck I...

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:40.980
I think, because the paper,

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.420
the paper, in fact,

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.220
I made a mistake when I read out the title.

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.980
The name of the file was Ontology of Meaning.

01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:51.100
However, the title of the paper itself

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:54.460
is Reinstatement of Essential Meaning.

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:56.380
Yes, okay.

01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:58.140
So it was originally going to be named

01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:01.220
something about Ontology of Meaning.

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:08.220
I was actually playing more into the philosophical tradition

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:09.540
and I wanted with that

01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:12.220
with when I was starting the kid's day.

01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:13.780
And by that, I just mean,

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:17.260
so kind of the traditional idea of Ontology

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:18.340
is going to be very different

01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.260
than high-figures kinds of Ontology.

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:27.300
And I won't go into the details of it too much,

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:31.340
but generally in traditional philosophy,

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:33.100
Ontology is almost like,

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:36.020
you can almost take like an inventory of the world.

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.740
So you have one category,

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:40.540
broad category, Metaphysics.

01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:42.980
And then a step up from that,

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:44.340
maybe you have Ontology,

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.700
depending on how you want to define it.

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:47.500
Everybody kind of seems to play with it

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.740
a little bit differently.

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:55.380
And in any case,

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:56.500
I'll just move on because I guess,

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.300
I fixed the title right before I submitted it

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.300
because I was like, man, I don't want,

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:04.460
you know, you start to notice your own mistakes

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.940
sometimes as they're happening.

01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:09.140
So you're saying that you don't prefer

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.500
using the term Ontology

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:14.180
because you don't want to mislead the reader

01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:16.540
as to what high-figure means by Ontology.

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:19.940
Is that why you wanted to change the name of the paper?

01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:23.100
Yeah, that's ultimately why I did end up changing.

01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:25.540
Well, and also because I was kind of thinking about it

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:26.900
in a more traditional sense,

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.100
almost like meaning was a specific type of thing,

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.420
but it's not a thing, like meaning is not a thing.

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.700
Absolutely.

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.900
Giving that, I was kind of implying that

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:40.340
with the title, as far as the traditional

01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:41.660
understanding of Ontology goes.

01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:45.820
And I really did not want to give that impression

01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:50.260
or implication that I was trying to call out meaning

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.420
as a thing or an entity.

01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:56.940
Because I most certainly do not think that,

01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:00.740
but in any case, then that paper, I was really trying

01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.940
I was trying to get across

01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:15.300
and how we might be able to begin thinking about meaning

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:16.580
and more importantly,

01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:20.380
where we, well, I guess,

01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:22.740
less about where we might experience it

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:26.740
and more about how we should be thinking

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:31.740
about meaning if we want to actually talk about it

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:36.020
in a genuine manner.

01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:38.860
And I say this because, and I go,

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:42.740
I'm pretty sure that's the essay where I talk a bit

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:45.220
about science and talk a bit about logic

01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:49.820
and I try to, I mean, it's really quick.

01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:51.420
I didn't have a lot of space to do this,

01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:55.220
but I try to point out the reasons why

01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:59.100
are the wrong frameworks where we're trying to discover

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:00.740
meaning and talk about meaning.

01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:07.340
And why I did this is specifically with scientism,

01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:12.060
but with really any reductive,

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.980
any scientist that's reductive,

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:18.420
you have this idea that everything can be reduced

01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.460
down to a certain thing.

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:22.740
So we can reduce things, a physical subject,

01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:26.700
things that chemistry or we can reduce things to our biology.

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:33.860
And you pair that reductive approach with scientism

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:40.700
or the idea that we're,

01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:43.860
and then just place in physics or chemistry or biology,

01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:50.580
you're gonna, there's no word for meaning anymore

01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:54.100
in that world, and meaning is considered non-existent.

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:57.300
It's considered unreal, it's considered at best an illusion

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:02.420
or some subjective manifestation made up by our minds

01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:06.980
as opposed to a real phenomenon.

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:11.980
And so that paper was really trying to get that idea across

01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:16.340
and to try to point to phenomenology

01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:20.540
as a legitimate outside logic in science

01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:22.100
for understanding the world.

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:27.100
And I argued for soul phenomenology,

01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:33.220
like only phenomenology approach,

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:36.140
but phenomenology and other things

01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:38.740
because if ultimately, I think,

01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:41.860
a holistic approach is the best approach

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:45.020
if you want to understand as much as you can.

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:48.900
And so by placing phenomenology aside,

01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:51.740
things like science and logic,

01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:56.500
for as tools for understanding ourselves in the world

01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:01.300
and reality and by saying ourselves world reality,

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:02.260
really just mean everything.

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:06.620
I just mean that everything, our experience,

01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:08.540
the world, the cosmos, you know.

01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:09.780
All of being.

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:11.140
Yeah, all of being.

01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:15.140
This is, I'm glad we're talking about this.

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:17.500
Perhaps before we get to the, sorry, did I interrupt you,

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:18.340
Jacob?

01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:19.300
I think you were not done.

01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.140
Were you done?

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:20.980
No.

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:21.820
Apologies if I did.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:23.940
Sometimes the connection, there's a bit of a lag.

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:27.100
Okay, so this is interesting because you've said here,

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:28.980
I wanted to ask from you,

01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:30.540
and this is very, very important, I think,

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:33.980
because now, again, going back to a point I made before,

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:38.980
it seems like science has taken the place of philosophy.

01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:41.740
And I think that's to our own peril.

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:47.060
And you've said here, science is reductive.

01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:50.060
So it attempts to describe meaning, experience,

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:54.420
whatever in a reductive sense.

01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:59.180
And then you've said it's trying to take a view from nowhere.

01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:01.380
However, this got me thinking,

01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:03.340
you made a really interesting point

01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:06.540
in your previous article that we discussed.

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.260
And I'm going to read out an excerpt

01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:10.060
where you've said it, you put it this way.

01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:13.260
You've said, so this is, I propose this idea of science

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:16.620
trying to be objective and taking a view from nowhere.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:21.620
You've commented on something by Ponty, by Molluponty,

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:24.780
where you put differently.

01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:27.820
And as Maurice Molluponty made explicit

01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:31.460
in his preface to Phenomenology of Perception,

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.460
this is really important what you've said here.

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:37.940
The third-person perspective of science

01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:42.940
is only made possible through first-person human experience

01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:46.860
because we only achieve a third-person perspective

01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:51.340
via a collection of first-person human experiences.

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:56.500
The subjective first-person experience then

01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:00.900
is something that is both pervasive and inescapable.

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:03.660
So this got me thinking,

01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:07.180
is it even possible for science to ever be objective?

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:10.300
Can we have an objective science in the sense of,

01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:13.140
can we truly, given that we are designed,

01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:16.820
we are being in the world, have a view from nowhere?

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:21.220
Oh, no, I think it's a myth.

01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:24.180
I think at best, we can have intersubjective knowledge.

01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:27.260
And I think that's what most people,

01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.020
not that they mean, not that they know that they mean this,

01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:33.700
but when most people say objective knowledge,

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:36.340
what they're pointing to is intersubjective knowledge.

01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:38.980
Because, yeah, I mean, I don't think there's any way

01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:42.300
to get around what Molluponty pointed out

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:44.140
in the preface to his book.

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.140
There's no way of getting out of it.

01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.700
There's no way of getting around it.

01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:50.660
That's all we have.

01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:52.100
And so, if we're gonna collect up

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:54.260
a bunch of subjective experiences

01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:58.980
and call them objective,

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:01.780
what we're really pointing to is intersubjectivity.

01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:07.580
So a scientist would probably try to challenge you

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:10.100
on that point, on account of that point, saying that,

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:11.700
oh, no, in the scientific approach,

01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:13.620
we have the double-blind study,

01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:16.900
or we have rigorous empirical research,

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:20.460
where when you present a paper,

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.540
or when you have a hypothesis,

01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:25.260
it's picked on by many other individuals,

01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:28.100
many other, well, not individuals, let's say experts,

01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:31.540
in that field who try and break down your arguments,

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:35.300
break down what one has asserted.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:38.740
And then why are this excavation,

01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:43.740
why are this breaking down or destructuring of a hypothesis,

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:49.940
if that proves the falsity or the truthfulness

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:53.260
of a certain hypothesis?

01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:55.700
And as scientists would try to counter you saying that,

01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:58.100
eventually, as we keep doing this,

01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:03.100
we get to this to put it plainly, view from nowhere

01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.260
or an objective approach.

01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:08.180
So how would you respond to that?

01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:16.620
I would, I guess I would respond by asking maybe some,

01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:24.140
a little bit of information about each of the experts

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:28.460
in the field that was trying to check over the work

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:32.060
and see if it works or not.

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:35.260
Because I think by doing that,

01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:39.220
very quickly you get to the idea that another person,

01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:43.300
this is another dozen that has a perspective on the world.

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:47.940
And so we're collecting his perspective and this,

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:51.100
and we're collecting the next expert's perspective on this.

01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:56.100
And I guess I would conclude by asking where it is,

01:33:56.940 --> 01:34:01.940
because if there is a view, it's a view from somewhere.

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:05.340
A view implies work.

01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:07.580
You can't view something without a viewer.

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:13.020
To have a perception there must be something perceiving.

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:15.700
And so I think to further imply perspectives.

01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:21.540
And so I think it's not, I mean, I'm just objectivity.

01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:26.140
I know some people are opposed here

01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:27.420
and they want something more objective,

01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:32.420
but I just, there's no reason to believe

01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:35.460
that there's anything as such,

01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:38.180
because everybody who has ever said that

01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:42.220
is saying that from their given perspective.

01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.780
And so it's almost like a performative contradiction

01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:46.860
in a sense, like if you're going to argue for a view

01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:50.420
from, you can't actually show the view from nowhere.

01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:55.420
And if you, to have a view is to experience some things,

01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:03.900
to be an experiencer, then I think it's just,

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:09.460
you get, and so I guess, yeah,

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:13.380
I guess that's, I would just try to respond in that way.

01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:16.900
And then if they can back and push back them.

01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:18.460
I'm not much of an arguer.

01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:20.900
I don't like arguments and things.

01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:23.540
A fair enough, but I tend to be quite,

01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:25.260
you and I probably are a bit different on that

01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:28.580
because I tend to be quite confrontational with these things.

01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:32.900
Yeah, because it is interesting

01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:37.540
because I even at like leaving maybe at a bit of a higher,

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:40.780
more like a cultural level, we have a lot of these things,

01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:44.700
you know, even in politics or whatever people say,

01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:48.780
I speak the truth, unbiased facts.

01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:52.940
I throw facts at you or what's this by the Ben Shapiro guy,

01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:54.620
facts don't care about your feelings,

01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:56.260
all these such things.

01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:59.820
But it seems like people don't even question the words

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:01.540
they use as in, what do you mean by facts?

01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:02.820
What do you mean by truth?

01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:08.140
And it even gets the idea of, you know,

01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:12.220
what can't try to describe in his critic of pure reason,

01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:14.860
there's pneumonia and phenomena.

01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:19.860
And there are certain things that we can never experience.

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:24.820
They are more like upper right concepts.

01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:29.820
And it does, but then, I don't know,

01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:31.940
but then I wonder if like a Heidi Gehran would ask,

01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:35.060
oh, in fact, no, the pneumonia itself doesn't exist

01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:39.980
without someone being able to view it or perceive it.

01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:45.700
Yeah, so that's a good question.

01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:49.500
Yeah, I think, so for Heidi Gehran,

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.540
there's no two-world model.

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:56.100
I guess I always refer to like some distinction there,

01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:57.700
two-world model, because you have like,

01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.540
yeah, things and they appear a certain way,

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:02.580
but then you also have these things behind them

01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:04.540
and that's like something else.

01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:05.900
And you can't get to that.

01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:06.740
You can't get to that.

01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:09.340
So I refer to it as two-world model

01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:11.300
because you have the appearance that you can get to

01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.100
and you have this hidden world that you can't get to.

01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:16.700
Yeah.

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.300
And Heidi Gehran has the single-world model.

01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:22.540
Yeah, he was very much opposed to the Cartesian approach

01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:23.860
in that sense, wasn't it?

01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:28.260
Okay, here's an interesting one.

01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.220
You've spoken about authenticity

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:32.340
in your paper, Ontology of Meaning,

01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:33.660
oh, sorry, not Ontology of Meaning,

01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:35.780
you've spoken about authenticity.

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:38.380
You've spoken about authenticity in the paper,

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:42.060
the re-instatement of Existential Meaning.

01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:43.860
I know I read that out a couple of the times,

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:48.420
it's just to clarify what we're referring to.

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:50.380
So when it comes to the topic of authenticity,

01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:52.700
it's something we hear very much in,

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:53.660
it's quite pervasive.

01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:58.180
We hear it quite a lot in the contemporary online conversations.

01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:00.380
As I said, a lot of corporations talk about

01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:02.980
bring your authentic self to work.

01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:06.060
For a Heidi Gehran or a phenomenologist,

01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:09.220
what is authenticity?

01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:11.060
And perhaps more importantly,

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:14.100
how is there a distinction between,

01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:17.380
let's say Saad's view of authenticity

01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:19.100
to what Heidi Gehran talks about?

01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:22.620
That is if there is a difference at all.

01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:29.580
So Heidi Gehran's understanding of authenticity

01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:35.580
is going to be related to, we talk very minimally,

01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:41.460
but I guess maybe we talked about possibilities

01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:45.260
and we're always projecting ourselves on possibilities.

01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:47.340
And so Heidi Gehran thinks that,

01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.540
okay, so let's talk about authenticity first,

01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:55.220
because it'll be easier to get to authenticity

01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:57.700
because Heidi Gehran thinks that we're all,

01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:03.700
all of us are most of the time living

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:05.380
in an inauthentic manner.

01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:08.980
Now, Heidi Gehran doesn't place any judgment

01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:10.860
on authenticity or inauthenticity.

01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:12.980
He's just kind of saying like,

01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:16.180
this is the way I'm describing things

01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:20.260
from this phenomenological approach.

01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:23.900
So he's not saying that one's good or bad necessarily,

01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:26.180
but of course we all have connotations

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.660
associated with those terms.

01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:32.980
So by living inauthentically,

01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:34.540
basically what Heidi Gehran's talking about

01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:39.540
is where we're in a fallen mode of being.

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:41.820
And that's always a possibility for us.

01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:47.500
And really what that just means is we're absorbed

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:52.500
in Das Man, which can be translated as the anyone

01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:54.500
or the they.

01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:58.500
And that's just, it could be anyone.

01:39:58.500 --> 01:39:59.580
It's kind of like group thought.

01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:01.140
You can think about it as like group thought

01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:03.700
or group thinking is kind of the way.

01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:08.140
So if you come across phrases like,

01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:13.700
this is what one does in this formal setting.

01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:16.740
Like that's another, if you hear that,

01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:17.980
everybody comes into that at some point

01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:21.060
where they're going to school or you're going to a restaurant.

01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:22.460
There's like, you behave in certain ways

01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:24.420
and you don't behave in other ways.

01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:28.740
And most of the time, I mean, a lot of times that's good.

01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.620
I mean, we have to have these cultural structures in place

01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:34.660
or else things would just be chaotic and hectic

01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:37.340
and nobody would get along at all.

01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:39.700
And everything would be in this.

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:43.100
So it's a lot of the time, it's not bad to be inauthentic.

01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:50.020
But if you're just always inauthentic,

01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:52.980
then what you do and the possibilities

01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:54.460
that you project yourself upon

01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:57.780
and the understanding that you have of yourself in the world

01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:02.780
is given over to you from the day, from the group thought.

01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:06.740
You're not taking anything up as your own.

01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:11.740
You're not reflecting on things from your own experience.

01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:14.620
You're accepting what they say

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:16.260
and you're doing as they do.

01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:18.220
And if you're doing as they do

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:20.020
and you're accepting what they say,

01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:24.220
that's why it's called sometimes translated as the anyone

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:26.620
because it could be anyone, you could be anyone.

01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:28.540
I mean, you are anyone at that point.

01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:31.860
There's really no individuation between you and someone else

01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:36.860
if you're both functioning in that sort of mode all the time.

01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:43.260
And so that's just, I guess, a very crude way

01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:45.580
to describe inauthenticity.

01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:50.580
And so to project yourself authentically

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:58.100
to, I guess, even become aware of your authentic possibilities,

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:03.300
you have to, in a sense, distance yourself

01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:07.180
from the world of the day, from the anyone.

01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:11.460
You have to sort of quiet the group thought

01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:12.540
in the group chatter.

01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:19.620
And High Digger says that, he says one way of doing that is by,

01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:24.580
is through, I mean, actually it's,

01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:28.820
so this is where his concept of angst and anxiety comes into play

01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:33.820
because he says during these experiences of intense angst

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:40.300
and anxiety, you almost come into contact

01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:46.020
with and experience nothingness in a sense.

01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:50.220
And this is more akin to, I think,

01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:54.140
what maybe what we would call it in contemporary,

01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:56.860
like severe depression rather than just anxiety.

01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:01.460
And so if you think about the severely depressed,

01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:06.220
they're almost, in a sense, living in a different world

01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:10.900
in the sense that they're not making connections

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:15.380
in practical references as they would in their everyday life.

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:18.620
Like things don't necessarily, things kind of like start,

01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:20.300
they begin to fail to make sense.

01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:24.180
And it's difficult for you to do very basic,

01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:26.980
practical everyday things if you're severely depressed.

01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:29.380
And somebody, anybody who's had these experiences

01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:30.900
can probably relate.

01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:33.340
I've had these experiences throughout my life.

01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:38.460
And the reason why this is,

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:43.860
why this might get you toward authenticity is because

01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:48.860
during those experiences, the world is quiet

01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:54.500
in the sense that you're not just running from one thing

01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:56.580
into the next, into the next, into the next

01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:59.620
as the public interpretation would happen.

01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:01.540
Or you're not just doing as one does,

01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:04.380
you're probably just sitting in a room by yourself

01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:06.580
and not knowing what to do or what to think.

01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:13.340
And so that's one way that Heidegger will say,

01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:17.060
you can distance yourself from public opinion

01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:20.860
and public chatter and public interpretation

01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:24.180
and understanding if you experience this.

01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:29.180
And I guess on the other, the next step of that is

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:33.900
realizing or coming to terms with your own death.

01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:38.500
And kind of reflecting upon your own death.

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:43.500
Because Heidegger says that that's the only truly,

01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:52.100
that's the only truly self-owned possibility

01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:55.540
in the sense that it's your possibility

01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:59.460
and it's no one else, it's nobody can die for you.

01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:01.380
I mean, if they die, you don't die.

01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:03.180
So they're technically not dying for you.

01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:05.220
Nobody can take over your death.

01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:08.660
When you die, if you were, you have to die the death

01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.500
or you're not dead.

01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:12.700
And Heidegger talks about this as the,

01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:14.900
he talks about death as the impossibility

01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:19.380
or the possibility of the impossibility of existence.

01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:20.500
Again, because he's staying true

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:21.820
to the phenomenological method.

01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:26.340
So the possibility of the impossibility of existence.

01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:28.180
Because Heidegger is not gonna say

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:29.420
what he thinks happens after death

01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:31.020
because he hasn't experienced it

01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:33.160
and it's not a phenomenological,

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.440
it's not a thing to talk about.

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:38.400
And so he says that it's possible that when we die,

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.080
maybe we won't exist.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.240
And that's kind of where he leaves it.

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:45.000
But by coming to terms with this

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.240
and the way that Heidegger describes,

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:50.680
which is essentially, it's my death and it's my own

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.400
and it's nobody else's death.

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:57.400
That's the first glimpse of what he's going to say,

01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.640
what he's gonna term authenticity

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:04.160
because it's my own possibility.

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.160
Okay, well, this is my own possibility.

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.880
Maybe I have other possibilities that are my own,

01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:12.000
not anybody else's.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.600
Maybe what might those possibilities be?

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:17.920
And then maybe you can start to think about

01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:20.760
how you want to live your life

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:25.320
rather than how they want you to live your life.

01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:29.720
And you can begin to construct an existence,

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:32.000
the way that you would like,

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
as opposed to the way that they would like.

01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:36.880
And through doing that,

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:40.760
you begin to reveal authentic possibilities for yourself.

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.160
They can project yourself upon,

01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:44.840
whether it's taking up a certain discipline

01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:47.720
or for me, it was doing philosophy.

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:52.720
I actually started my formal education in a different field

01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:56.480
and really looked philosophy,

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:58.720
but everybody said that's what I should not be doing

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:01.680
in a formal setting.

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:04.280
I should get educated so I can make money.

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:06.760
And so, and I did listen to what they said

01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:08.880
for a very long time and then eventually I said,

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:11.200
you know what, I'm just gonna do this.

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.400
I can't stop reading this.

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.040
I can't stop thinking about this.

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.040
I'm obsessed with philosophy.

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:19.800
I don't know if I can force myself to go to school

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.800
for anything else, so I'm just gonna do it.

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.280
And so, I guess I like using that example

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:29.920
because it was very obvious to me

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:34.920
that I was being directed by popular opinion

01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:39.600
and what they think I should be doing.

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.520
And then when I took over my existence as my own

01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:46.120
and whatnot, then I started to

01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:49.960
reveal these authentic possibilities for my existence.

01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:54.400
And so really what authenticity for Heidegger means

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.080
is importing yourself in a way

01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:02.000
that is unique to your own existence

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.240
and in such a way that you've chosen those possibilities.

01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:07.880
You've taken them over as you're on your take.

01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:09.480
And so responsibility comes in here

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:13.640
because if you're just doing whatever you want on a whim,

01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:17.320
that's not a very great way to live either.

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.080
You might think you're being authentic,

01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:20.840
but you really don't have a self at that point.

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:23.200
I mean, you're not cultivating anything.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.120
In any real sense.

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:28.840
And so maybe you're doing what you want to do,

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:33.840
but you're not manifesting an authentic self

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:36.560
in the way that Heidegger would say

01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:40.880
that you need to if you're gonna be authentic.

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:45.880
However, does Heidegger place any moral judgments

01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:49.160
on the concept of authenticity itself

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:52.360
for a design or a human being?

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.680
In contrast, let's say someone like Sarth,

01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:59.560
who does seem to, he calls it bad faith to be inauthentic,

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:02.800
who does seem to play some kind of moral judgment

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:05.760
despite him not being a fan of moralism

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:07.800
into authentic experience.

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.800
And I guess I'm trying to ask is there even a difference

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.840
between Heidegger's version

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:17.040
and Sarth's version of authenticity?

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:21.440
I'm not incredibly familiar with Sarth's version.

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:26.080
I feel like if I don't want to say anything that,

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:28.600
yeah, I guess I just,

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:31.400
I guess I want to refrain from commenting

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:33.640
because I don't know enough to say

01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:37.560
whether or not they could basically be considered the same.

01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.560
The only thing that I will say is that,

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:47.600
I know Sarth did misinterpret Heidegger on a few things.

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.040
And one of those things was the way

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.760
in which Heidegger was using the term as essential.

01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:55.880
And if we're talking about existential possibilities

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.920
and how important existential possibilities are

01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:00.520
for Heidegger's idea of authenticity

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:04.080
and if Sarth did misinterpret Heidegger on that point,

01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:07.960
then I would think there would be a difference

01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:10.160
and maybe an important distinction

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.680
to make between the two concepts of authenticity,

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:15.480
but I don't know for certain.

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.480
But does Heidegger himself place

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:22.040
any kind of qualitative differences?

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.280
I don't want to use the word moral.

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.520
Let's say qualitative difference

01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:27.560
between being authentic and inauthentic.

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:32.600
No, no, he doesn't.

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:37.640
And I think the reason is because we,

01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:45.080
even if we're aware of our possibility

01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:49.000
for authenticity and even if we're living an authentic life

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.080
most of the time, we're still participating

01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:58.080
in cultural structures that would be considered inauthentics

01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:03.760
by Heidegger's thought on pretty much an everyday basis.

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:08.760
And it's not a bad thing to be doing.

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.240
It's necessary.

01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:16.880
We're taught when we're children

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:19.800
to look both ways when we cross the road.

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:21.840
What one does before they cross the road.

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:23.000
Yeah.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.880
So even these very mundane things

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:27.600
that you wouldn't really think about

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:31.960
in this philosophical capacity would be lumped into this idea

01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:36.960
of things, it's all term inauthenticity this way.

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:42.040
Things that we've taken over from history

01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:44.560
and culture and society

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:47.960
as far as ways to act and ways to think about things.

01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:51.200
And it's not a bad thing.

01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:54.720
I mean, I don't, I think we should all still look both ways

01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:56.320
before we cross the road.

01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.160
Yeah.

01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:58.560
That's what's prescribed.

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:01.320
Yeah, another great example of Hubert Raphis.

01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:03.760
I believe it's Hubert Raphis, pretty sure it's him.

01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:08.760
He uses on the phenomenon is when you get into an elevator

01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:11.920
the distance you stand from other people

01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:14.480
and he says that that can culturally differ in fact.

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:16.560
So when you get into an elevator

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:19.840
some people don't mind being a bit too close to each other

01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:22.520
whereas perhaps in Western countries

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:25.160
we would prefer having a bit of space

01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:27.240
and we wouldn't want to be too close to another person

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:30.000
whereas I remember growing up in Sri Lanka

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.120
if you even take public transport

01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:35.680
the other guy is just breathing down your neck

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.280
right next to you.

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:40.800
You wouldn't even see that here in Australia for instance.

01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:43.960
Yeah, and again, those just because we're a part

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:47.840
of certain kinds of cultural practices does not make,

01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:50.120
that is yes, inauthentic, but I wouldn't,

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:54.360
how would I say that makes you a morally inferior person?

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:56.400
Well, he doesn't make moral claims for starters

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:58.880
but he wouldn't even try to place any kind of

01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:01.000
qualitative judgment on it, isn't he?

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:05.000
Yeah, yeah, so sometimes there's,

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.680
I mean, the terms are so, they're translated

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:11.680
as authenticity and authenticity so much

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:14.000
that I think it would be difficult to get away

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.720
from that particular translation of them

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:21.720
but another possible translation of the term

01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:26.680
that he uses in German for authenticity,

01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:30.080
I mean, you could translate it as oneness or,

01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:35.080
so it could be like something that you chose

01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:38.960
like in a self-owned manner or something like that.

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:42.280
And so like inauthenticity, you know, might be just,

01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:47.280
it's a thing that you're doing that you didn't really,

01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:52.120
you weren't the original agent to prescribe that

01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:55.560
or something, you know, I mean, it's kind of difficult

01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:57.240
to talk about without just using the terms

01:53:57.240 --> 01:53:58.760
that are always used in the translations

01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:03.680
but I feel like in the original language,

01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:07.000
it wouldn't have such heavy connotations as it does

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.280
in Western culture as far as like acting authentically

01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:12.640
as something you must do all the time

01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.440
and you must always avoid it.

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:18.360
Yeah, and the problem is again with authenticity

01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:20.200
or even passion, which we can get to,

01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:22.520
hopefully in the next conversation I check it,

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:25.360
is that it's a colloquialism, it's used

01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:29.080
so it's pervasive colloquially and it comes

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:33.000
with a lot of baggage, so it's a bit hard to,

01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.280
here's where I really wish that I learned,

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.440
I could speak German.

01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:38.720
In fact, I'm trying to learn French

01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:40.520
to read some of the French philosophers

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:44.400
but maybe one day in life, who knows, maybe even German.

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:49.480
Oh, yeah, mate, so look, that was fantastic.

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:52.200
I am really feeling refreshed

01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:54.120
and I would even say to a certain extent,

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:55.840
I think I'm in the flow state right now,

01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:57.800
so I'm just really, really feeling it.

01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:02.960
I don't think we'll have time to go through all the paper

01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:06.400
and in fact, just to give it the time that it deserves,

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:10.760
I wanna probably have a separate episode on that.

01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:14.600
We're coming to the two-hour mark

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.720
or we've even crossed two hours now.

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:19.040
Maybe to kind of, as like a conclusive statement,

01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.440
more of just practical advice.

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:24.360
As someone who studies philosophy, as a writer,

01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:28.880
I would ask you a two-part question.

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:31.800
What advice would you have for people like myself,

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:34.240
in your fights, or even just people

01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.720
trying to get into philosophy

01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:37.880
on how to study philosophy?

01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:40.440
And secondly, what advice would you have

01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:42.760
on writing philosophy?

01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:48.840
So as far as studying philosophy goes,

01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:52.880
it's always a good idea to have an understanding

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:56.120
of the history of philosophy.

01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:00.560
That way, you kind of, so getting an idea of the history,

01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:04.840
if you reflect on that sort of study,

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:09.040
you start to come to certain realizations

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:14.040
as far as maybe how one idea inspired another idea.

01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:21.520
And you also get an idea of what's been said already.

01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:25.840
So, okay, so when you get into philosophy,

01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:27.120
sometimes it happens where you think

01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:29.120
you have a really cool novel idea

01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:30.000
based on something you've read,

01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.000
but then you realize that somebody else also said that

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.440
like a thousand years ago.

01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:37.880
And so, the thing of the history is good for that reason too.

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:41.600
So you're not just spending time reiterating something

01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:44.440
that somebody's already done a thousand or 2,000 years ago.

01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:50.120
It also gives you an idea that nothing is absolute

01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:55.120
in the sense that, I mean, you can see how much has changed

01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:59.800
over the centuries of philosophical thought

01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:04.800
and I think that's good for the ego,

01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:06.840
just to get a given understanding

01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:10.120
that they didn't have the absolute truth.

01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:11.800
I'm not gonna get the absolute truth,

01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:13.160
but we can think about these things

01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:16.680
and still maybe discern partial truths

01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:18.760
or something like that.

01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:21.200
I always like to have that in mind

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:23.880
when I'm writing things or thinking about things.

01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:28.400
So any more, like when it comes to your process

01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:31.040
of reading, writing, what's the,

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:33.600
how does it look like on a day-to-day basis?

01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:39.960
Consistency is, I think, what has helped me above all else.

01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:43.120
Like just reading a little bit every day

01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:45.280
or studying a little bit every day when you can't,

01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.720
like even if it's 20 minutes.

01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:48.240
So like the first thing,

01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:50.040
a lot of times the first thing I do in the morning

01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:55.680
is I listen to a lecture or I listen to part of an audio book

01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:00.120
or a podcast, you know, where they're discussing certain things.

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:03.720
Because that just really gets my mind going right away

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:05.520
as far as thinking about these things.

01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:10.440
And the reason why I choose, sometimes I'm too tired,

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:11.760
like for the first hour that I wake up

01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:13.320
that I can't really force myself to read,

01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:15.320
but I can listen to something.

01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:16.760
I can get my coffee.

01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:18.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can,

01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:19.960
I can listen and drink coffee.

01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:22.200
It's hard for me to read and make my coffee.

01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:27.480
So I think repetition or consistency

01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:30.600
and just persevering, like you think you don't understand

01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:32.920
some of the things, like don't just stop reading it,

01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:34.080
just read it.

01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:35.680
Even if you don't understand it, just read it

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:39.280
because you might start to understand

01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:42.240
bits of it after you're finished.

01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:43.520
And even if you don't,

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:45.800
things might start to make sense maybe months later

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:47.080
or something like that.

01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:49.440
That's the experience I had with high degree in time.

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:52.120
I read it once and came away from it saying,

01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:55.560
dude, I don't understand literally anything this guy said.

01:58:57.240 --> 01:58:59.440
But I feel like there's something really important here.

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:03.600
And so I really dove into secondary sources and lectures

01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:06.200
and going through the book multiple times after that.

01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:10.960
And so I would say just read a little bit every day

01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:14.520
and make notes right in the margins of your book.

01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:15.760
If you have a physical book,

01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:18.960
don't try to keep your book super perfect and neat.

01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:22.840
Just start writing stuff down and highlighting stuff.

01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:25.560
If you have a question about something you read

01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:27.080
and it seems like it's a good question,

01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:29.680
write the question next to the paragraph in the book.

01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:32.440
I just doing small things like that

01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:34.320
has helped me a whole lot.

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:36.600
Highlighting things you think are important.

01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:38.120
And then highlighting things in a different color

01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:39.840
that you just don't understand.

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:41.960
You know, because you can go back through

01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:46.400
and you can, it has to be an active process, I guess.

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:48.640
Maybe that's what I'm trying to get around to.

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:50.640
It involves an active process.

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:53.360
You're not just sitting there and taking in words

01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:55.440
that you're seeing with your eyes.

01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:58.360
It's an involved process of writing

01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:00.280
and thinking and reflecting.

02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:03.760
And don't be concerned with reading too quickly

02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:06.760
or saying, it's taking me forever to get to the 10 pages,

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:10.560
but it's gonna take me a year to read being in time.

02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:13.520
Just give it the time.

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:15.800
It will be quicker and easier to read.

02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:18.120
And I just like to take the approach

02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:19.960
of giving things the time that they ask.

02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:22.200
They're gonna ask you for a certain amount of time

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:24.320
and just give it to them.

02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:30.200
So do you normally pick a thinker

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.720
and then study all of that thinker's work,

02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:36.720
the whole over of the thinker's work?

02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:40.440
Or do you rather pick, let's say,

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:44.320
a fundamental philosophical text

02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:47.080
like it could be critique of pure reason

02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:50.480
or some of Plato's Republic, whatever it may be,

02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:53.320
and then focus on the text itself?

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:55.960
Or are you more thinker focused?

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:04.400
So really, I'm more thinker focused now

02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:09.240
than I have ever been, but previous to this,

02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:14.240
I almost always say I was thinking just broadly.

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:17.360
Let's just say I was thinking about topics

02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.640
and philosophy of mine.

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:26.280
And maybe I got intrigued by physicalism.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.680
Well, then I would go through and I would try to find

02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:33.120
what the history of physicalism was

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:38.000
and what the major thinkers were in kind of read along

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.640
the concept or the theory from a variety of perspectives.

02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.600
And then I really immerse myself in it

02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:49.320
and try to think from that perspective.

02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:51.560
And sometimes you do have to spend a lot of time

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.400
to get to the added areas

02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:57.320
or to get attuned to that kind of motive thought

02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:00.000
so that you have to spend more time.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.960
But then after that, I would read the opposite view.

02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:06.400
Whatever the opposite view was,

02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:08.560
not necessarily just arguments against

02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:09.800
whatever position it is,

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:13.880
but what's like a contrasting theory or idea.

02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:15.000
And then I would dive into that.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:15.840
And so I did that.

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:20.400
Honestly, that's what most of my undergrad time doing

02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:25.400
was just like kind of juxtaposing theories and concepts

02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:27.600
with contrasting theories.

02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:30.440
And just trying to get a really holistic view

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.000
of like why people think things.

02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:36.640
I don't have very strong opinions personally.

02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:40.200
It's easier for me to do that sort of study.

02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:43.800
I'm just, I'm always very skeptical of everything,

02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:46.600
but also myself at the same time and try to say,

02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:49.520
I mean, I can appreciate ideas that maybe I disagree with.

02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:57.040
And it'd be very difficult to say anything absolutely.

02:02:58.360 --> 02:02:59.200
I could-

02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:01.040
Well, it's interesting though,

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:06.040
I hear a typical trope by more public intellectuals

02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:11.400
is be skeptical, be open-minded, be critical,

02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:12.880
be objective, be rational,

02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:16.800
we hear all these terms thrown around quite a lot, isn't it?

02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:20.600
But it's also sometimes I think,

02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:25.200
I'm not trying to pick on a particular public intellectual,

02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:27.560
like someone like Steven Pinko or Sam Harris

02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:31.320
who constantly to almost like ad nauseam,

02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:33.880
talk about rationality and reason

02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:35.960
and being open-minded and whatnot.

02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:41.360
They also don't seem to get it that in fact, firstly,

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.200
being skeptical, being critical is,

02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:47.040
it's a really difficult thing to do.

02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:50.840
It's in fact quite unnerving.

02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:53.480
It leaves one in this state of angst

02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:55.560
and there's no stability in one's life.

02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:00.120
And it's, if you truly authentically do it

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:03.320
in a very genuine, sincere way,

02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:08.320
it can leave one unraveled, uprooted, you know?

02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:10.320
It's not an easy thing to do.

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:14.040
No wonder you see, it's like what Dostoevsky said,

02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:19.040
it seems that men with large hearts and deep minds

02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:22.160
seem to be the most miserable.

02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.520
And I think he says that in common punishment,

02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:27.320
I'm paraphrasing him.

02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:30.960
And then also comes the other thing where even these,

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:33.760
again, what should I call them?

02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:36.040
New Age Atheists, not New Age Atheists,

02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:39.320
like the New Atheists, so again, public intellectuals,

02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:43.440
they, for me, all of their skepticism,

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:45.160
it's not skeptical enough.

02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:47.560
They still are very much a domain,

02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:49.360
their own domain of reason or whatever.

02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:53.120
It seems like they haven't explored many other areas

02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:57.520
that probably, then probably would even unravel them

02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:59.880
because all of their work would also then deconstruct

02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:00.720
and break down.

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:04.560
And that's funny, because that's when you were talking

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:06.080
about specifically proud of,

02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:07.240
I know you didn't want to pick on anybody,

02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:09.240
but when you brought up Sam Harris, you know,

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:11.200
I just thought, yeah, he's always talking about

02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:12.120
people should be skeptical,

02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:16.120
but I don't think he's skeptical about his own thoughts at all.

02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:17.960
But just that, yeah, it's not for,

02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:21.000
he doesn't portray that, he doesn't give that impression.

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:24.280
He never, he hasn't questioned himself enough to,

02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:26.840
for me to say, yeah, he's skeptical.

02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:29.040
I don't think he's very skeptical at all.

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:31.400
Yeah, because it seems that, again,

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:33.200
I don't know why, I guess this is a very arbitrary

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:35.280
and just big Sam Harris, but even Sam Harris,

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:39.400
he has his foundational like axioms he works of,

02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:41.960
but within those axioms, he will question,

02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:45.160
he'll be critical, but he never tries to break down

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:47.240
those axioms themselves, which I feel,

02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:49.800
which is why I admire an intellectual like Heidegger,

02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:52.040
which is what Heidegger was trying to do.

02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:58.000
And that's, yeah, I guess all I would say,

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.480
Jacob, especially, thanks a lot, man.

02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:02.440
I truly am grateful.

02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:04.680
As I said, I'm a complete amateur,

02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:07.640
so it means a lot that you shared your work with me,

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:10.440
even the stuff that you haven't publicly published

02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:12.080
for me to go through and study.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
I haven't read the whole of being in time yet.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.600
Slowly working my way through it, you know,

02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:21.720
plotting along, one could say,

02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:24.200
but it's a worthwhile journey.

02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:28.800
It's also something I've realized, I do it now more as,

02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:31.040
in some sense, it's like a moral responsibility

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:33.320
that I'm obliged to do this,

02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:35.120
that I should make time for it.

02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:40.680
And that means spending a lot of time in solitude,

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:44.480
not really getting out, but the point I was trying to make

02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:46.680
is I think you're a great thinker,

02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:49.400
you're a fantastic writer.

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:51.120
We didn't really get much into the writing,

02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:52.360
hopefully in the next episode,

02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:56.440
but I can't thank you enough, Jacob, it means a lot.

02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:00.840
You're a good bloke and I'm looking forward to the work

02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:03.800
you do in the future, more and more of what you write.

02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:06.520
And when you do write the,

02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:08.800
when your being in time comes out,

02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:13.120
let's have another episode and talk about your magnum opus.

02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:16.720
That's fair, sure, certainly, yeah, I really appreciate it.

02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:20.120
Thanks for having me on and chatting.

02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:23.320
And I'll just reiterate something I said earlier,

02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:28.320
if you guys want to read any of the papers

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:31.480
and I can't find them or can't get ahold of them,

02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:37.400
feel free to contact me and they'll be happy to be over.

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:43.400
And again, I'm a better writer than I am a speaker, so.

02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:46.040
Oh, no, man, you did great, trust me.

02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:48.040
I am not good at neither,

02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:52.160
so you actually just got one thing to get out of the writing.

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:54.360
But not just, Jacob, just on that note though,

02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:57.520
you said that your website was still under construction.

02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:01.720
So if I do leave a link to the website,

02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:03.480
it's probably not going to load,

02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:07.080
but is the domain going to be the same one

02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:09.760
or are you going to change it completely?

02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:12.280
The domain will stay the same.

02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:15.320
Yeah, the website is under maintenance right now.

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:18.480
I'm kind of revamping it to,

02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:20.680
I'm trying to provide resources and information

02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:23.440
about phenomenology and existentialism

02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:25.960
and specifically meaning and meaningfulness

02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:30.800
and just trying to provide a little bit of direction

02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:33.600
for people that are looking to read more about the stuff

02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:35.560
and study it and yeah.

02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:38.520
So I can't say how soon it will be finished,

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:42.000
but I would say it's not going to be

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.800
more than maybe three weeks or four weeks from now.

02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:50.880
Fantastic, yeah, I'll try to get this up as soon as possible.

02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:55.200
In any case, I shall leave a link to your Twitter account

02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:56.440
or Twitter profile,

02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:58.120
and then if people do want to get in touch with you,

02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:00.720
they could contact you there, correct?

02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:04.080
Yep, certainly, yeah, and I think I might even have a link

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:05.160
to my website on,

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.720
if you don't put it on here or whatever,

02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:10.840
people can find it, I think on my Twitter.

02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:12.720
Perfect, thanks mate, cheers.

02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:15.720
I shall stop recording now, take care.
