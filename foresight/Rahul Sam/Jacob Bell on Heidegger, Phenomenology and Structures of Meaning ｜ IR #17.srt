1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Jacob Bell is a philosopher and writer.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,640
He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,920
from the American Public University

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,120
and is doing his masters of research in philosophy

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,500
at the University of Wales, Trinity St. David.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,400
The working title for his dissertation

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,840
is a Phenomenological Analysis

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,520
of the Structures of Meaningfulness.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,120
Jacob's primary academic interests

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,800
include phenomenology and existentialism.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,480
So Jacob, that's like the formal definition

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,040
or the formal bio, let's say.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,080
Would you want to give an introduction yourself, Mayne?

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,040
I'll give a less technical introduction and say,

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,480
I like thinking about weird things

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,440
and philosophy is the perfect discipline

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,920
that'll have me to do that.

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,880
But yeah, no, I don't have anything else to add.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,920
A Bachelor of Weird Things, that sounds good.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,840
Sounds very much like what we're all interested in, isn't it?

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,040
Yeah, so let's jump into it.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,400
For starters, maybe let's get some definitions out of the way

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,680
to lay some groundwork.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,320
So within your fields of interest,

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,080
some, let's say, terms would be philosophy of mind,

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,040
phenomenology and existentialism.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,560
So maybe you could give us a bit of a elucidation

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,760
on what those terms are, how they interconnect

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,320
and correlate, but also how they are a part

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,960
of a broader philosophical framework or a school of thought.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,760
Yeah, so philosophy of mind,

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,880
I guess I understand that as a branch of philosophy

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,640
that kind of investigates things like mind and consciousness,

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,600
which, I mean, to be honest, is a really bad way

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
of defining the topic, because you don't get any further

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,640
than the phrase itself.

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,200
So I guess to go into it a little bit further.

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,480
If anybody is familiar with philosophy,

40
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,360
they've probably heard of things like physicalism

41
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,120
and idealism and dualism.

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,760
Those are like some, I mean, those are metaphysical theories,

43
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,400
but they're prevalent and they're always being discussed

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,800
in philosophy of mind.

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,360
So you might find people in philosophy of mind working

46
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,560
on trying to discern whether the mind is a physical thing

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,960
or if it's a separate substance

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,760
or if maybe it's fundamental,

49
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,000
like maybe a panpsychist sort of take on it.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,520
So those are like some of the more popular topics

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,560
that philosophers of mind are working in,

52
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,560
I guess, something maybe a little more specific than that.

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,200
You get to think about idea of the perception.

54
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,160
What is what I'm perceiving the real world?

55
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,960
There's a representation that kind of plays

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,000
into philosophy of mind and metaphysics more broadly,

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,960
which then feeds into ideas like,

58
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,240
is the world a mental construct or is it independent of us

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,800
and then you start to get into topics of realism.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,840
And so it all kind of feeds back into each other,

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,560
but I think as far as contemporary philosophy goes

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,280
or philosophy of mind goes,

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,640
really what you're seeing,

64
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,680
or at least what I see 90% of the time

65
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,680
are people trying to struggle with where to place consciousness

66
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,040
as far as in a physical world, in a mental world,

67
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,880
in a dualistic world or as something fundamental.

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,080
So one thing I've learned recently being a neophyte

69
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,760
is that it seems that all the concepts of ideas

70
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,600
and philosophy, it never is arbitrary.

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,960
It doesn't just come sort of deos,

72
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,160
ex machina, I don't know where.

73
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,800
It does have an history.

74
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,880
And where would you sort of, again,

75
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,440
I propose philosophy of mind,

76
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,440
where would you, is there a starting point

77
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,720
where at one point in the history of human,

78
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,120
let's say, human knowledge,

79
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,320
people start getting interested in this topic,

80
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,240
or has it in some sense been the ultimate question,

81
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,600
time immemorial ever since the dawn of consciousness,

82
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,440
let's say?

83
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Which question specifically you're referring to?

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,800
Let's talk about philosophy of mind for now.

85
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
Yeah, I mean, I think I came,

86
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,520
I don't know if you say I was gonna,

87
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,080
I wanna say pre-socratics,

88
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,120
but I think maybe shortly after the pre-socratics

89
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,960
with Plato,

90
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,160
because with the pre-socratics,

91
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,000
you see some pretty heavy metaphysical stuff going on,

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,840
but it's mostly like, is the world made up,

93
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,720
I mean, democratists with the very early atomic theory,

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,320
is everything Adam's been avoiding moving around,

95
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,120
or is everything water, is everything fire?

96
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,640
So you have this idea of like monism in the pre-socratics.

97
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
Sorry, maybe because that's the top,

98
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
that term is quite a loaded term.

99
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,320
So monism is the idea that,

100
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,560
well, actually I'll let you explain,

101
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,760
Jacob, please, if you could explain what monism is.

102
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Tom, so the term just signifies the idea that everything is

103
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,360
one or everything's made out of one particular type.

104
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,840
There's no duality.

105
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,920
Yeah, and I guess that's just one way of putting it to you,

106
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,120
because I mean, I'm saying things are made out of one type

107
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,520
of stuff, so I'm kind of implying that we're talking

108
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,760
about substance-based,

109
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,600
philosophy, substance-based metaphysics,

110
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,960
where like the pre-socratics talking

111
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,880
about different types of material

112
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,520
that things might be made of.

113
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,360
And then, yeah, I guess that kind of leads

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,720
into a little bit of philosophy of mind

115
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,800
when you get to Plato and talking about the ideas

116
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,920
and talking about theory of forms and stuff like that.

117
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,400
And so, yeah, I guess philosophy of mind really came

118
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,720
about around the time of Plato.

119
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
I mean, I'm not a great historian of science,

120
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,840
so somebody might be able to correct me on that, but...

121
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,360
Oh, better than me, mate, better than me.

122
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,360
So that's something I've always wondered

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,520
where initially the idea came from,

124
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,720
or was it more like the Aristotelian way

125
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,040
where people instead of focusing on philosophy of mind,

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,400
humanity or human beings were more focused on

127
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,920
let's say the physical world,

128
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,440
the way a scientist would be.

129
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,840
How do things move, causality?

130
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,160
But I'm coming to realize, perhaps,

131
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,400
that it was the other way around,

132
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,840
even before people were interested in the physical world,

133
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,000
it was more on the world of mental constructs,

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,520
even things like ethics or metaphysics.

135
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,000
And it's, maybe we could get into, you know,

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,240
fewer, fewer writings that shift

137
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,240
where now it seems people are more physicalists

138
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,800
over, let's say, idealists

139
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
and why that change has taken place.

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,720
And then in your paper, where you talk about meaning,

141
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,880
sort of the ontology of meaning, one of your papers,

142
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,240
you kind of discuss what the, let's say,

143
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,760
the social consequences of that could be.

144
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,680
But anyway, I don't want to get too carried away.

145
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,280
Okay, now we get to the interesting stuff,

146
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,320
whether the fields that you're interested in,

147
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,800
and this is what really drew me to your work,

148
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,560
that's phenomenology and existentialism,

149
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,600
or the way you put it, weird stuff.

150
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,320
So could you please explain in the field of weird stuff,

151
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,440
what that is, what those two terms mean?

152
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,320
And I guess, look, anyone could Google

153
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,280
what phenomenology or existentialism is,

154
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,280
but maybe personal to you, how do you give it?

155
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,600
And maybe juxtapose it with some other schools of thought

156
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,040
in philosophy and science to explain it, please.

157
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,400
Sure, before I do dive into phenomenology,

158
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,920
I just want to place one little caveat

159
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,080
on what I was just saying with regards to philosophy in mind,

160
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,000
and saying that I was generally speaking

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,400
of Western philosophy.

162
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,840
I mean, if we start to look at Eastern philosophy,

163
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,120
I mean, we're going to be able to look back,

164
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,080
way before the pre-sacratic into philosophies

165
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,800
and different things like that to get certain ideas of,

166
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,120
I mean, they had some ideas of idealism

167
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,400
before I think any Westerners really did.

168
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,240
So we could look back in history much further

169
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,040
if we were looking to the East as well.

170
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,680
So I just wanted to make that point.

171
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,680
So I didn't seem ignorant to the other side of things there.

172
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Of course, and I point well taken, point well taken.

173
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,760
Yeah, in fact, maybe now I need to kind of change

174
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,760
what I said before or add on to it,

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,320
because certainly in a lot of Eastern philosophy,

176
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,000
consciousness in the mind, let's say, was a big part of,

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,840
well, more than philosophical practices,

178
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,680
more like spiritual practices, isn't it?

179
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,400
But now we get to the, this is probably semantics,

180
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,920
like how do we discern spirituality and philosophy?

181
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,040
What's the difference?

182
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,800
But that perhaps the whole other conversation.

183
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,680
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,360
Yeah, sorry, go ahead.

185
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,920
I was going to say that'd be a big conversation

186
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,280
just in itself.

187
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,120
No, man.

188
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,760
I'm hoping to, in fact, speak to John Mavaki

189
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,440
because he seems like the perfect person

190
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,880
to discuss those nuances and subtleties

191
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,920
between all these terms.

192
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,120
Yeah, but saying that.

193
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,480
So yeah, sorry, existentialism and phenomenology.

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,880
So phenomenology, I'll give a very brief,

195
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,040
I guess like formal description of it.

196
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,080
I guess just trying to place it in history a little bit

197
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,320
because it's a relatively, I mean,

198
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,480
when we're talking about philosophy,

199
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,920
it's relatively new.

200
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,600
I mean, early 1900s, late 1800s is when Husserl,

201
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,160
Edmund Husserl was working on publishing

202
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,600
the first formal definition, the descriptions

203
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,280
of what he took phenomenology to be.

204
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,200
So he's considered the founder of phenomenology formally.

205
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,960
Anyway, you can find threads of it

206
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,440
throughout the history of philosophy.

207
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,040
But yeah, so he published in The Logical Investigations

208
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,560
and then I think like then 12 years later in Ideas,

209
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,520
kind of like almost like I got some guidelines

210
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,160
as to what phenomenology is or should be.

211
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,320
And very basically, it's the study of experience

212
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,680
as experience and that doesn't say up a lot,

213
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,400
but it's really about taking your first person perspective

214
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,560
and kind of applying some rigorous analysis

215
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,720
to your experience and trying to figure out

216
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,880
what certain things mean, trying to make sense of things

217
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,880
as you experience them, as opposed to kind of standing

218
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,880
outside of your experience or trying to put the experience

219
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,120
aside to get a more objective view of the world.

220
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,960
So it stands in direct contrast with things like empirical

221
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,640
science.

222
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,040
I mean, you're not going to find an awful lot

223
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,760
of phenomenology there, except in neuroscience.

224
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,040
And we can talk about that later.

225
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,240
I actually made a note because I want to talk about that

226
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,080
a little bit.

227
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,320
Because of phenomenology, we're taking into consideration

228
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,160
our feelings and our moods and our personal values

229
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,200
and things like that as ways of understanding the world,

230
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,120
you could say, whereas as guides to understanding the world.

231
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,000
I mean, just for example, if we're talking about meaning,

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,480
which I'm sure we will get around to it later,

233
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,200
but I'll just make a comment here about it.

234
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,760
I mean, if we're talking about meaning in life,

235
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,480
if you take an objective, try to take a scientific

236
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,760
objective approach to that, you're not really going to be

237
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,640
able to say what's meaningful to you because you're going

238
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,640
to be kind of prevented from considering your interests

239
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,640
and your values and some of the things that you're passionate

240
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,560
about, the things that you're interested in in life,

241
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,160
the way you feel about things.

242
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,360
And if you take all of that out of consideration,

243
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,160
I don't know how you would calculate a meaning in life.

244
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,280
Yeah, of course.

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,480
So maybe one example I enjoy, I read somewhere,

246
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,360
is to kind of maybe use like an analogy.

247
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,160
It probably, I probably wouldn't even call this an analogy

248
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,120
because it's, in fact, what a phenomenologist would do.

249
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
So as a phenomenologist, if I give you a,

250
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,600
and I'm sorry to kind of put you on the spot here,

251
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,480
but as a phenomenologist, if I give you a cup of coffee,

252
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,720
what would you do?

253
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,040
If you're told, let's say by Husserl himself,

254
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,640
a guy comes back from the dead, from Resorex

255
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,400
and tells you that, study this cup of coffee

256
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,440
as a phenomenologist, how would you do that?

257
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,840
What would your process be?

258
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,080
Well, so I guess it depends on whose phenomenology we're using.

259
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,880
So after Husserl-

260
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,360
Spoken like a true philosopher.

261
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,480
After Husserl, you know, kind of formally came out

262
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,200
with the idea and it started getting,

263
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,840
I mean, he got a lot of interest right away.

264
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,240
I mean, it was a really,

265
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,000
it's for such a new and kind of

266
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,600
divergent approach to doing philosophy.

267
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,200
It gained a lot of interest really quickly,

268
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,480
but pretty much everybody who took over the approach

269
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
took it over in their own way.

270
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,960
And I don't think we could really say

271
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,400
that anybody had the same sort of phenomenological method.

272
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,560
I mean, Husserl had very specific techniques

273
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,280
that he wanted that he thought we should apply

274
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,960
while we're doing phenomenology, like the echocache,

275
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,080
which is just to like suspend or bracket

276
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,720
what he calls the natural attitude.

277
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,120
And that's just to say like the kind of habitual way

278
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,800
in which we interpret our experience.

279
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,960
He said, you know, let's just like put those aside.

280
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,120
Let's ignore that sort of stuff

281
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,760
and try to just pay attention to the experience

282
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,520
as we're experiencing it and describe it as such.

283
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,400
Now, you get it, right out following that,

284
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,120
you get Meryl Lopanti, a French phenomenologist,

285
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,720
saying, you know, in his practice,

286
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,280
the phenomenology of perception.

287
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,560
One of the most important things we learned

288
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,320
about the phenomenological reduction

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,200
who Husserl described it is that

290
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,600
a full reduction is impossible

291
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
because we can never get rid of

292
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,200
all of our interpretive strategies.

293
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,800
If we did, we wouldn't be able to make sense

294
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,640
or describe our experience at all.

295
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,160
And he's not the only one that kind of criticized that.

296
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,960
I mean, Heidegger did to a much greater degree.

297
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,280
Heidegger has a very specific concept of phenomenology,

298
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,560
not necessarily what you think phenomenology should study,

299
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,360
but kind of the approach.

300
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,960
He thinks that the approach should be a specific way.

301
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,960
Like we're looking to derive specific truths

302
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,000
about the world and the phenomenon in the world

303
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
when we're using phenomenology.

304
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,560
And so he's there, everybody, I mean,

305
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,520
I guess all the phenomenologists are limiting

306
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,480
in their views on what phenomenology should do.

307
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,120
But I do wanna say something about the way

308
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,560
in which Heidegger defines phenomenology

309
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,920
because I think it's a very brilliant description of it.

310
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,720
And so Heidegger, when he's describing phenomenology

311
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,720
and being in time, but also in the lecture course,

312
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,360
given a few years before he's published being in time,

313
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,320
and that lecture course is called

314
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,960
the History of the Concept of Time.

315
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,920
Sorry, just to clarify.

316
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,480
So being in time is Heidegger's Macdemopus, right?

317
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,880
We should probably put that out.

318
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,040
Sorry, I didn't interrupt you, Jacob, keep going, yeah.

319
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,640
No, you're good.

320
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,160
Yeah, being in time is what he's most famous for.

321
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,120
Even though, I mean, he wrote a lot.

322
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,520
He has a lot of books, he has a lot of papers.

323
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,360
His later work differs a little bit from his early work,

324
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,400
but there's also a dispute as to how real the turn is.

325
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,640
The later Heidegger and the early Heidegger, yeah.

326
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,840
Yeah, and I'm not really knowledgeable enough

327
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,080
to comment on how different those two things are.

328
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,840
I'm kind of working my way chronologically

329
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,320
through this moment's work.

330
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,440
But yeah, in being in time,

331
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,360
and his earlier lecture course,

332
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,040
he describes phenomenology by going back to the ways

333
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,040
in which the Greeks use the term phenomenon in logos.

334
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,200
So he's kind of taking apart the term phenomenology

335
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,560
and separating it and looking

336
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,920
to the Greek definitions of this.

337
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,960
And in the book, Heidegger says that, you know,

338
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,920
that the Greeks understood the term phenomenon

339
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,800
as this is gonna sound very obscure and esoteric,

340
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,920
but I'm gonna give hopefully an easier

341
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,880
to understand description afterward.

342
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,800
But he says, phenomenon is that which shows itself

343
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,720
in itself, which is a manifest.

344
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,200
Typical Heidegger.

345
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Yeah, and the term for the Greeks also carried connotation

346
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,640
of like bringing something to light and illuminating.

347
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,080
And then the logos, Heidegger explains,

348
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,040
the Greeks understood by the logos,

349
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,480
something like discoursing,

350
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,760
but not just like, not just dial fuck

351
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,280
and not just a verbal utterance,

352
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,200
but it's more of a discursive communication

353
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,880
that lets something be seen.

354
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,040
And so you could think of the logos as words,

355
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,300
whether utter or written down or what have you,

356
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,640
that point to something, they let something be seen.

357
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,240
It's kind of, it's bringing something to light,

358
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,160
it's bringing the phenomenon to light.

359
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,840
And so we wanna understand this in a less obscure

360
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,400
and difficult way than Heidegger likes to put things.

361
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,400
We can say something like, the logos points

362
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,280
to the phenomenon in such a way

363
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,600
that the phenomenon becomes un-concealed

364
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,360
or the logos allows the phenomenon to come into view

365
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,440
by looking and out of experience

366
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
in such a way that it can be seen.

367
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,560
And so really it's almost like your words should connect

368
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,760
with something that can be pointed out in experience

369
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,000
or can be shown in experience.

370
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,200
And so we're not, and he contrasts this

371
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,760
with the idea of free-floating concepts and words and ideas.

372
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,160
And by that, he just means something like,

373
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,920
we don't wanna abstract away so much from experience

374
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,400
that we're just playing language games.

375
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,640
We want our words to be able to meet up with experience

376
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,840
in such a way that if I say something,

377
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,800
so like in some of my papers about meaning

378
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,040
what I'm trying to do,

379
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,360
that I'm trying to point to experience,

380
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,240
I'm trying to point to particular experiences

381
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,320
and particular moments in particular experiences

382
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,680
where maybe someone might find meaning.

383
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,680
So I'm not, I'm just trying to bring something into view

384
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,320
using words and concepts.

385
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,920
I'm glad you said that, Jacob,

386
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,440
because in one of your papers, I forget which one,

387
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,760
you've sort of touched on this,

388
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,160
but a question that came to mind was,

389
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,520
so from the definition you gave,

390
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,480
definition of phenomenology,

391
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,320
how does that differ from, let's say,

392
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,960
the empiricist tradition or the empiricist approach,

393
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,480
which tends to be quite popular these days,

394
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,000
especially in the world of artificial intelligence,

395
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,880
where we think that our epistemology or our knowledge

396
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,400
or our truths of the world is revealed

397
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,760
purely based on empiricism,

398
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,840
which is experiencing measuring things

399
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,000
and that in some sense, the mind is a blank canvas

400
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,480
and the world just gives us information and input.

401
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,120
So from the empirical approach,

402
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,880
how does phenomenology differ?

403
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,040
So phenomenology is gonna differ in the sense that,

404
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,480
okay, so if we think about the empirical approach,

405
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,720
specifically as it pertains to the sciences,

406
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,560
we're trying to get a collection of experiences

407
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,040
that kind of compile and point toward the same

408
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,440
sort of thing in experience.

409
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,200
Now, the major difference I guess is going to be

410
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,120
what it is we're trying to discern in empirical science

411
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,640
as opposed to something like Heidegger's phenomenology

412
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,040
or the way that I just described phenomenology.

413
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,040
With a scientific and empirical approach,

414
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,080
we're usually looking at objects

415
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,880
and we're trying to figure out

416
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,920
what sort of properties these objects have.

417
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,760
And so, I mean, I guess physics or chemistry

418
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,360
is a great example of that.

419
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,920
And we're trying to see maybe what house to entities

420
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,240
interact with each other.

421
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,160
And we're going to perform experiments to do that

422
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,360
and we're gonna try to replicate the experiments.

423
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,600
And we're gonna try to not let our first person

424
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,600
perspective influence exactly what we're investigating.

425
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,360
So, phenomenology is gonna differ from that.

426
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,040
In that we're not collecting data

427
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,160
and we're not measuring stuff.

428
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,200
We're experiencing, we're trying to pay attention

429
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,560
to the experience as it's experienced.

430
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,440
So, you're not gonna measure your experience of meaning,

431
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,240
say you're going to more so,

432
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,040
if you're doing a phenomenology

433
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,920
and you're trying to discern maybe what you find meaningful,

434
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,200
you're going to more so reflect on maybe

435
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,000
the way that you feel

436
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,880
when you were participating in a certain activity.

437
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,840
And from there, you might also start to look

438
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,800
at the structures of the experience,

439
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,160
more so than just the feeling of the experience,

440
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,960
which might be what's involved in this activity

441
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
or what's involved in this experience.

442
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,200
What are the things that are essential

443
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,280
to the experience without which I could no longer say

444
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,560
that it was a meaningful experience.

445
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,720
Those are the sorts of things

446
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,080
that sort of questions phenomenology is going to ask

447
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,800
and specifically high digger

448
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,360
because specifically for high digger,

449
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,360
he's wanting to discern the a priori structures

450
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,640
of existence and experience,

451
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,120
which is just to say a priori meaning

452
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
always already there.

453
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
Like what's necessary?

454
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,960
What are the, what structures are necessary

455
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,480
for this to exist

456
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,840
or for me to have this particular experience?

457
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,080
Yeah, I guess I'll leave it at that for now

458
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,360
because otherwise I'm going to get into a really deep,

459
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,120
or you can ask a clarifying question

460
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
because otherwise I'm just going to go on at the end.

461
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,600
No, that was perfect, mate.

462
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,800
I think in many ways you lead me to my next question.

463
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,960
I mean, I thought we were going to discuss

464
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,360
existentialism too because obviously it's kind of

465
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,240
like the precursor or not the precursor,

466
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,320
but it's highly correlated to phenomenology.

467
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,840
But perhaps since we're already on this topic,

468
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,800
in some sense, I kind of regret even asking that question

469
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,360
because I'm coming to realize that maybe it's not fair

470
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,840
to ask questions such as, oh, what's the difference

471
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,720
or what's the stark difference

472
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,960
between phenomenology and science?

473
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,160
Because if you think of a field like let's say psychology

474
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,120
or cognitive science,

475
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,440
those fields have had a massive influence

476
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,400
by thinkers like Merleau Ponty

477
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,840
or Heidegger by phenomenologists.

478
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,960
So, well, the question I was going to ask is,

479
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,440
how does phenomenology, and I was also going to say

480
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,360
existentialism, but we didn't get to that still,

481
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,600
but let's just say, how does phenomenology differ

482
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,360
from a more scientific approach?

483
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,760
But maybe to make things even a bit more interesting,

484
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,360
let's talk about, in fact, how does it relate

485
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,720
to fields like psychology and cognitive science

486
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,200
where in the scientific approach,

487
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,240
what we always try and do is remove the subject,

488
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,280
so remove the subjective experience.

489
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,000
But clearly, there are some fields even within science,

490
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,840
but you can't do that.

491
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,440
You can't remove the subject

492
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,880
from cognitive science or psychology.

493
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,200
So maybe to make things a bit more interesting,

494
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,280
how do they correlate, how do they connect

495
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,580
to phenomenology, those fields I mentioned?

496
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,380
Sure, sure.

497
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,060
So I want to comment on cognitive science

498
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,940
just a little bit first, and then I want to maybe dive

499
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,500
into a little bit of neuroscience

500
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,620
and how phenomenology might be related,

501
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,740
because I actually presented a paper last year

502
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,020
at a philosophy conference hosted by a university

503
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,900
in the Czech Republic on this topic

504
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,100
of phenomenology neuroscience.

505
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,740
But before I get to that, you know,

506
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,420
something that I really appreciate about cognitive science

507
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:03,420
is that it really embraces the subjective experience.

508
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,660
And like you said, you can't remove that

509
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,620
from cognitive science, cognitive science necessarily.

510
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,620
And I mean, so they're, I think the most prevailing approach

511
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,260
in cognitive science right now is 4E cognitive science,

512
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,740
and that's just the 440s.

513
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,700
I always forget one, but it stands for embeddedness

514
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,660
and embodied, inactive, and I, like I said,

515
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,380
I always forget the fourth one.

516
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,460
I don't know why, but...

517
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,860
I'll leave a little caption on whatever,

518
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,740
just too far, if it was all good, yeah.

519
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,740
Yeah, have somebody place in the comment where I'm from.

520
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,140
Kind of take the video, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine.

521
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,140
But a lot of the, so a lot of those ideas really,

522
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,060
I mean, I believe have an inception in phenomenology.

523
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,620
I mean, they're, you know, especially in Heidegger,

524
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,860
with Heidegger's idea of being in the world,

525
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,780
you know, which we'll get to.

526
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,900
But it's just this idea that there's a more holistic structure

527
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,580
to the world and the existence

528
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,580
that we need to take into consideration

529
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,100
when we're trying to understand things about the world

530
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,340
and trying to understand things about ourselves

531
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,620
and maybe the way in which we interact with the environment.

532
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,460
And so, I think phenomenology played at least the role

533
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,900
in trying and getting a lot of those ideas

534
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,060
going for cognitive science.

535
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,540
Now, as far as neuroscience goes,

536
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,020
Anil Seth, I'm sure you've heard of Anil Seth.

537
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,180
Yes, I have, yeah.

538
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,060
He recently wrote a quite a popular science book

539
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,980
right on the brain.

540
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,980
And so he does a lot of work trying to map

541
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,060
the brain correlates of certain experiences.

542
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,380
So he's trying to see like what's going on in the brain

543
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,980
at a given time when someone's having a particular experience.

544
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,220
And he's trying to build that map out.

545
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,980
And you can't build that map

546
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,540
if you don't have good phenomenology.

547
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,220
Because if you think, just think about it,

548
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,900
if we think about it simply,

549
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,900
as far as, okay, let's say brain region X lights up

550
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,820
when I have experience Y.

551
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,980
And let's say we can gather all the data we want

552
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,580
about the brain structure

553
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,580
and we can reproduce it and map it as much as we want.

554
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,180
But if we don't have a good description of the experience,

555
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,660
we're not gonna know what we're mapping

556
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,100
this brain activity to.

557
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,140
And so in order to have good correlative mapping,

558
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,620
we have to have good phenomenology.

559
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,620
We have to have like a good description of the experience.

560
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,540
And we have to have people, the participants in the study

561
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,500
that they're studying,

562
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,660
trying to get this correlative mapping going.

563
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,980
They have to be familiar with the experience,

564
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,140
not only as it is experienced,

565
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,860
but they have to understand what it is

566
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,380
that the neuroscientists are trying to map.

567
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,380
Like what experience do you want me to have?

568
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,780
So then I can tell you what I'm having

569
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,860
and so you can mark down what's going on in my brain

570
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,620
when I'm having that experience.

571
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,420
And so you have to have a whole lot of phenomenology going on.

572
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:30,220
Not only the participant being able to recognize the experience

573
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,340
and being able to communicate that to the researchers,

574
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,660
but the researchers also have to have

575
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,780
a pretty rich phenomenological description

576
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:43,340
of what it is they want their participants to experience.

577
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,580
And that way they know precisely when the experience has started

578
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,700
because I mean, there might be like a very important,

579
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,540
as far as neuroscience,

580
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,300
so there might be a very important spike

581
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,460
in a particular brain region

582
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,020
that they are trying to map to a very specific,

583
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,020
maybe milliseconds of an experience.

584
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,500
And if you don't get that right,

585
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,540
it's just not going to be correct.

586
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,660
Your description is going to be wrong

587
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,780
and your correlative mapping isn't going to mean anything

588
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,980
because you might have one side of it,

589
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,900
or you're going to be missing the other side of it.

590
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,980
But also Jacob, what makes phenomenology even beyond, let's say,

591
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,380
that because see what we are talking about here,

592
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,260
it's how can I put this?

593
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,140
So, oh, by the way, so the book Anil said,

594
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,180
the person you were talking about, it's called Being You.

595
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,700
So it's a very, I think it's a neuroscientific approach

596
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,940
to experience, but what that got me thinking

597
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,580
was as you were describing things,

598
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,340
we're thinking of very localized experiences.

599
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,340
So like, here's this pen, it's a black pen.

600
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,700
I'm looking at it.

601
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,260
What's my, to use a term,

602
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,100
philosophers use qualia, let's say,

603
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,140
and which parts of my brain likes it.

604
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,100
But when it comes to phenomenology, of course,

605
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,260
we even go beyond that.

606
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,660
We even go to what you write a lot about,

607
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,740
which is meaning and kind of the questions

608
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,500
that truly make us human in that sense, right?

609
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,180
So, and is that where we could maybe connect that

610
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,060
to fields such as psychology?

611
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,500
So I think, I mean, yeah, we could connect to there,

612
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,140
but I think we could still even bring it back

613
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,980
to neuroscience in the sense of,

614
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,940
so I know there was some research done,

615
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,940
trying to map brain activity and experiences of happiness.

616
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,500
And this particular study didn't even have a description

617
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,940
of what a happy experience might be as experienced.

618
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,140
And so, that was one of the experiments

619
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,420
that I pointed to in my paper where I said,

620
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,660
I mean, they admit that one of the more difficult parts

621
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,700
of what they were trying to do

622
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,100
is the phenomenal, a lot of logical aspect of it.

623
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,580
But at the end of the day, it's like,

624
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,300
I mean, it doesn't really,

625
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,740
that research can't really mean anything

626
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,540
until you have a good description

627
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,180
of what a happy experience is.

628
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,780
And it's very difficult to do

629
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,820
because obviously not everything's gonna make everybody happy.

630
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,460
We're gonna have different,

631
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,780
not necessarily definitions of what happiness is,

632
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,020
although we might have that too,

633
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,860
but different experiences are gonna make me happy

634
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,980
and different experiences are gonna make you happy.

635
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,260
And that gets even more complicated

636
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,060
when we start talking about meaning.

637
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,180
But another good example of this in neuroscience

638
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,020
is the flow experience.

639
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,700
So they're trying to kind of map out

640
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,620
what's going on in the brain

641
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,460
when somebody has an experience of flow.

642
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,780
And not only is flow,

643
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,820
I wouldn't say it's a rare experience

644
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,220
for a lot of people,

645
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,700
but it's also not an everyday sort of experience for people.

646
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,300
And so it can be a little elusive.

647
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,820
And again, so I think when we're talking

648
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,860
about something like that,

649
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,620
we're trying to do some neuroscientific research

650
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,740
about flow and the flow experience,

651
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,820
we need to have good phenomenology

652
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,180
and we need to have good communication

653
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,860
around the experience in order,

654
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,820
I guess really in order to have good research

655
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,300
and to be able to expand our knowledge

656
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,900
of what it is that's going on when we're in flow.

657
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,300
And I'm very critical of science for a lot of reasons,

658
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,420
but I also think it's,

659
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,540
I mean, we need science,

660
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,420
I'm not a science denier of any sort.

661
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,380
And I love seeing good research around these topics.

662
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,820
It's just unfortunate that there's a lot of the research

663
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,660
to just poor research

664
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,460
because they kind of shit on philosophy a lot.

665
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,100
And so I think it's philosophical discipline.

666
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,820
I think from what I read in one of your papers,

667
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,460
you've even used this term,

668
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,260
it seems like you're critical of scientism, isn't it?

669
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,900
It's not science per se,

670
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,140
where scientism is this, like it's an ontology.

671
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,540
The part replaces the whole.

672
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,740
And in fact, I was watching this interview,

673
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,260
sorry, I'm going off on a tangent here,

674
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,100
but that's okay, it's at the conversation.

675
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,060
I was watching an interview and Slavoj Zizek said that,

676
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
that the modern problem is,

677
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,580
the ultimate questions,

678
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,980
do we have free will, what is consciousness?

679
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,180
Even questions pertaining to meaning,

680
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:24,460
we've localized those questions to the scientific domain

681
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,300
where historically,

682
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,580
those things were normally answered by philosophers

683
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,140
and philosophers have the ability

684
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,420
to pull it from different disciplines

685
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,460
and kind of connect them all together,

686
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,060
where science, it's affected by what science is,

687
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,140
doesn't allow that.

688
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,540
So it seems that scientism is the problem.

689
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,940
And okay, I'm thinking how are we gonna do this?

690
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,700
So I wanna get to,

691
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,220
because I think this perfectly connects to your,

692
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,620
not your paper, but the article you wrote on Epoch Magazine,

693
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:58,180
which was the structure of meaning and experience,

694
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,020
rediscovering that which has been lost, that article.

695
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,620
But we didn't discuss existentialism yet.

696
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,820
So, since we're on the topic of meaning,

697
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,260
maybe we could give like a bit of a prelude

698
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,100
to what existentialism is

699
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,380
and how that pertains to meaning

700
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,020
and then we'll get to your article,

701
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,340
because if not, I feel like we're gonna get carried away.

702
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,100
I also have a few more questions about Heidegger,

703
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,100
but I certainly wanna discuss what you've written.

704
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,580
So Jacob, like maybe we'll start with existentialism

705
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,660
and then we'll move on to your article, if that's all right.

706
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,660
So I understand existentialism as a philosophical study

707
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,540
of the human condition and all of its guts and glory,

708
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,540
because I say that because a lot of existentialism

709
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,340
is around kind of gutsy topics like death

710
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,340
and it can seem kind of dark,

711
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,260
especially when we're talking about things

712
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,220
like anxiety and dread, but it's really,

713
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,540
it's just an attempt to try to understand

714
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,980
the human condition and all of its facets.

715
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,380
I mean, so we have the human as the essential subject

716
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,180
and not just like the biological human

717
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,560
or the physical human, but more than that,

718
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,040
we have the experiencing human.

719
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,480
And so, I mean, we can see already

720
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,000
how it can connect up with phenomenology nicely.

721
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,840
But I mean, the existentialists are gonna ponder questions,

722
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,240
like what does it mean to live and die?

723
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,360
What should I be doing with my life?

724
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,720
Should I act responsibly?

725
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,640
Do I have, what kind of freedom do I have?

726
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,800
Do I have any freedom?

727
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,160
What does death mean?

728
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
Is there meaning in life?

729
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,440
Is everything just meaningless?

730
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,440
So, I guess very human questions

731
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,320
that most of us have probably thought about at some point.

732
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,360
And it's approached in a rigorous manner, though.

733
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,960
So I guess that's what makes it,

734
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,960
I feel like thinking about these things in a loose manner.

735
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,080
So it's approaching these very human clashes

736
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,040
in a more rigorous manner.

737
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,040
Yeah, what's interesting is we've got colloquial terms

738
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,880
such as existential dread or existential crisis.

739
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,360
It seems like those terms wouldn't even exist

740
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,160
if not for the existentialists themselves

741
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,880
writing about these topics.

742
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,800
And even with an existentialism,

743
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
it's starting from caricature to nature

744
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,000
to the French existentialist or, of course, Heidegger,

745
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,520
which is why, you know,

746
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,840
what probably perhaps what makes philosophy interesting,

747
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,960
you can never say this is what existentialism is, right?

748
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,200
It's the thinkers themselves don't agree with each other.

749
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,960
And in fact, people such as Camus,

750
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,600
who we would think as an existentialist,

751
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,760
rejected that term.

752
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,080
But I think you put it best check.

753
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,840
The way I think about it is that

754
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,120
it's the ultimate human questions,

755
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,880
leaving aside obstruous detached metaphysics

756
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,200
and coming back to our human experience.

757
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,880
And that, speaking about experience,

758
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,600
that leads us to your article.

759
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,440
So I'll reread the title,

760
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,960
The Structure of Meaning and Experience.

761
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,440
By the way, not to fatter you too much,

762
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,080
you are a brilliant writer, mate.

763
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,880
I aspire to write like you one day,

764
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,920
especially on such obstruous topics.

765
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,200
It's well written, it's well written.

766
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Thank you.

767
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,760
The structure of meaning experience,

768
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,520
we discovering that which has been lost.

769
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,880
So obviously I read the article,

770
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,960
but for let's say for anyone who hasn't read it,

771
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,560
maybe give a bit of a summary

772
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,920
of what you were trying to cover

773
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,200
and convey in this article.

774
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,120
Obviously all the links down below the description.

775
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,920
And this one's on Epoch Magazine.

776
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Yeah, so I will preface what I'm going to say

777
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,960
with the very honest answer that,

778
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,720
honest comments that I'm a better writer

779
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,560
than a speaker.

780
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,600
So if you're listening to this

781
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,440
and I sound like I'm all over the place,

782
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,280
I would ask if you read some of my papers and articles,

783
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,240
it might make more sense.

784
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,000
I could be all over the place when I talk.

785
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,320
Okay, so anyway, so in that article,

786
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,080
you know, it was one of the first articles,

787
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,640
I guess not one of the first,

788
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,040
but one of the first that I published

789
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,920
about meaning and meaningfulness.

790
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,480
And I was really trying to work out in that article,

791
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
kind of what my own perspective was on it

792
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,280
and how I wanted to communicate

793
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,360
what I was thinking about meaning.

794
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,040
And so I really liked that article for that reason

795
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,040
because I think it's almost like a foundational piece

796
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,880
of writing that shows me the direction that I need to go

797
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,640
and to try to illuminate these ideas a little bit more.

798
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,880
But in general, what I'm doing in the article

799
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,520
is trying to go through and talk about

800
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,080
where we can find meaning and experience as it's experienced.

801
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,360
And so I'm not appealing to analytic arguments

802
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,640
to try to convince you that meaning is real in that article,

803
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,960
which is what a lot of analytical philosophy is.

804
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,760
It's kind of creating a coherent argument

805
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,520
to try to convince or persuade someone

806
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,040
that something is true and they're often very isolated.

807
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,080
I try to take a holistic and phenomenological approach.

808
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,120
And so I'm trying to point to certain experiences

809
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,880
where I think people have found meaning

810
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,680
and where I have personally found meaning

811
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,320
and where people that I've talked to have said,

812
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,480
yeah, I find this really meaningful.

813
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,760
I've been trying to talk about the structures

814
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,480
of that a little bit and also eliminating those structures

815
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,480
also means describing what's necessary in the experience

816
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,000
or what might be necessary in the experience

817
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,120
for it to be a truly meaningful experience.

818
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,120
And I'll leave the introduction to that at that

819
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,360
and then see what questions you might wanna ask.

820
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,200
Sure.

821
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,720
So, you know, meaning seems again,

822
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,680
like one of those terms like consciousness,

823
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,920
which is, it seems to be a bit of a loaded term, isn't it?

824
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,880
So what for you is a meaningful life?

825
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,600
So I like to, so like you said,

826
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,600
it's a meaning is a very obscure and ambiguous term.

827
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,600
And I like to link, I like to link this back to,

828
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,600
was it a priori or a gust, I think it was a gust,

829
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,400
that said something about time.

830
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,800
I know what time is and so somebody asked me what it is.

831
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,800
And then when I'm asked, you know, I really,

832
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,120
I can't figure it out, I can't give a description

833
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,720
or I can't explain what time is.

834
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,520
Or you could say, or you could say meaning is like pornography.

835
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,480
He knew it when you see it.

836
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,680
You know when you see it.

837
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,880
Yeah, I mean, you know, actually,

838
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,640
I think that's a great, a great, a great,

839
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,200
I purposefully did not give an analytic definition

840
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,360
of meaning in that article or really in any paper of,

841
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,480
because I think giving a definition of it

842
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,480
is kind of doing an injustice to it

843
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,280
because it's a sort of thing.

844
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,840
So you have to experience it.

845
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,360
So you know it when you feel it,

846
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,120
you know it when you experience it.

847
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,680
And so that's another reason why,

848
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,040
rather than try to tell people what meaning is,

849
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,520
for me, a meaningful life.

850
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,200
And I will say that I,

851
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,760
relative, not subjective, but relative,

852
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,840
and I think there's a very important difference.

853
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,680
It's gonna be relative to each of our personal existences

854
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,680
and that we find value in the things

855
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,000
that make us feel purpose,

856
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,840
the things that sort of,

857
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,160
the things that like to vitalize us,

858
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,600
give us vitality, give us,

859
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,280
almost as zest, you know, as zest for life.

860
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,500
That I like to point to as indicators of meaning.

861
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,080
For me, a meaningful life is doing philosophy and writing

862
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,480
and having a few close friendships

863
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,800
and having a loving family.

864
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,400
And I think all of these things are important

865
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,960
for a holistic meaning.

866
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,200
Now, in the article that we're talking about right now,

867
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,360
I focused in on one type of meaning

868
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,520
because I think it's the easiest to point to an experience

869
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,880
and that's like a passionate activity.

870
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,600
So I use the artist as an example in that article.

871
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,360
But it could just as well be a scientist,

872
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,280
it could just as well be a philosopher, a writer.

873
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,440
You know, I don't think you can put a limitation

874
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,120
on what sort of activities are meaningful

875
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,360
because that would just be quite absurd

876
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,080
because I'm sure somebody finds something very meaningful

877
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,760
that I would absolutely dread doing.

878
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,560
And actually I know that's the case.

879
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,160
And so it's gonna be relative.

880
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,640
So I can say what's meaningful for me

881
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,640
and I can try to describe what's meaningful

882
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,400
for other people.

883
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,480
Not in the sense that I'm gonna tell you

884
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,640
what you're gonna find meaningful

885
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,920
but in the sense that this person

886
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,920
that has practiced a specific discipline,

887
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,360
a specific art maybe for their entire lives

888
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,360
and it's kind of like what they breathe and live

889
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,000
and it's their guiding passion.

890
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,240
I mean, I think that's a very good indicator

891
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,080
that they're finding something incredibly meaningful

892
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,360
about that endeavor.

893
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,900
And meaning certainly is not the same as happiness.

894
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,080
There's a lot of times where I'm writing

895
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,160
and studying philosophy where I'm not getting

896
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,480
some sort of immediate happy feeling from it

897
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,000
or pleasure out of it.

898
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,800
Sometimes it's very difficult and frustrating

899
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,080
but there's maybe a transcendent value that

900
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,960
I guess to use it, I'm gonna use the phrase

901
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,000
that you used last time we chatted.

902
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,400
It's soul edified, it lifts the spirit

903
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,480
in a way that is distinct from happiness and pleasure.

904
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,720
But it's a passion.

905
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,640
Yeah, I'll just say, I'll leave it at that.

906
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,600
Yeah, because I mean, look, passions, it's an amazing,

907
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,120
I in fact have a question, not pertaining to this article

908
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,080
but one of your other papers where in fact

909
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,640
you've used the word passion extensively,

910
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,360
the title of the papers.

911
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,560
You said that this is gonna be published soon in a,

912
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,000
so sorry, let me read out the title first,

913
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,720
passion as a disclosure of meaningfulness in life.

914
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,440
This hasn't been published yet, isn't it?

915
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,960
You said it's gonna be published in a journal soon.

916
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,440
So that paper is still in review.

917
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,960
I have not gotten a communication as to whether it will be

918
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,960
published or not, the ontology of meaning paper,

919
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,240
that one's gonna be published in

920
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,480
Countess Journal of Philosophy in 2023.

921
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,120
Sure, sure, sure.

922
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,280
But maybe if people are interested,

923
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,520
they could probably tweet at you if you don't mind of course

924
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,400
and if they're interested in reading the paper,

925
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,480
because I don't wanna leave it,

926
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,560
because then I'll publish it,

927
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,560
I'm not gonna share them publicly.

928
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,280
Sure, yeah, someone's interested.

929
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,000
So yeah, I can't really circulate it

930
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
until I really have a decision from the journal,

931
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,800
but if anybody's interested in reading it

932
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,080
or looking over it or discussing it,

933
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,240
definitely reach out, I can send a PDF copy.

934
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,080
Yep, great.

935
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,600
All right, so meaning,

936
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,280
this probably leads us to

937
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,560
a bit of a Hadegarian question.

938
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,520
I was gonna discuss Hadegar separately,

939
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,680
but why discuss Hadegar abstractly?

940
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,320
He himself wouldn't like that.

941
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,880
Let's connect it to your work.

942
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,240
You've said that we live in a techno-scientific era

943
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,520
and you said that we are attempting to take a view

944
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,560
from nowhere in the modern world.

945
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,760
And when I read that bit,

946
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,280
I was even trying to connect that

947
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,280
to kind of this modern new age obsession with stoicism,

948
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,880
where it seems that everyone talks a lot about stoicism

949
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,480
being detached from the world.

950
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,160
And I don't know if that tightly correlates

951
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,520
to this idea of the view from nowhere.

952
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,000
Everything is just a cosmic phenomenon.

953
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,480
Nothing really matters in some sense, ultimately.

954
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,400
So I placed this question in two parts, Jacob.

955
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,600
Firstly, ultimately, what was Hadegar struggling with?

956
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,280
What was he trying to figure out in his work

957
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,760
and what were his concerns?

958
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,720
For instance, like in the essay,

959
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,840
a question concerning technology, essays like that.

960
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,600
And the second part of the question is, from his work,

961
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,640
how does that pertain to the question of meaning

962
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,120
and human experience?

963
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,240
So there is very upfront about the question

964
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,320
that he's asking, and it's, what is the meaning of being?

965
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,240
And that's so vague that nobody can get an idea

966
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,680
of what it is until they've read the whole book.

967
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,400
And then maybe you can understand the question after that.

968
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,800
But he's really just asking, in what sense,

969
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,240
in what sense do things exist?

970
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,600
I mean, that's kind of what he's asking.

971
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,000
Maybe an easier way to understand the question.

972
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,680
And so he asks this question,

973
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,560
and he says that we've, the tradition

974
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,040
has really forgotten about being and what being is.

975
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,040
And for Hadegar, and this is gonna kind of

976
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,800
come back around to his approach to phenomenology

977
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,080
as far as the idea that he thinks phenomenology should

978
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,120
discover or disclose the apriori structures of existence.

979
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,240
And so being for Hadegar is synonymous

980
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,080
with the apriori ontological structures of existence.

981
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,720
So the structures of experience and existence

982
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,000
that are necessary for us to be having the experience

983
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,400
that we're having right now.

984
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,480
And this is, so we can contrast this with science,

985
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,160
most certainly, and also traditional philosophy,

986
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,040
because traditional philosophy and science

987
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,280
is kind of working in this subject-object sort of framework,

988
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,080
and they're also working within mostly

989
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,400
a substance-based framework.

990
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,600
So we have a substance, so we have objects,

991
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,400
and objects are made out of a substance.

992
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,560
And what kind of properties does these objects have?

993
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,720
And this is another reason, I mean, and this is direct.

994
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,000
The reason why he was so against Descartes

995
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,280
and had a lot of criticisms of Descartes,

996
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,720
because Descartes is kind of perpetuating

997
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,920
these philosophical assumptions that he thinks

998
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,040
that Hadegar thinks are completely unfounded,

999
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,480
such as, I mean, what is it to be,

1000
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,080
like what is the human person,

1001
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:26,080
and Descartes's gonna say this immaterial consciousness,

1002
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,520
that's the person.

1003
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,880
So we're a substance, where he's bringing us back

1004
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,640
to the substance-based sort of metaphysics.

1005
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,920
Hadegar basically says, no, this is all wrong.

1006
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,240
We need to look at being, and we can't look at being

1007
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,400
when we're trying to look at objects and the properties,

1008
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,400
because in order for us to even look at objects

1009
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,960
in their property, so in a sense,

1010
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,760
in order to even have an empirical science

1011
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,080
that can try to discern properties

1012
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,200
of certain substances and certain objects,

1013
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,520
we need all these other things already in place,

1014
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,920
and that's what he's pointing to

1015
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,800
with the aphriora structures.

1016
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,080
And so that's kind of what Hadegar is up to,

1017
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,520
in being in time, really.

1018
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,480
And he's gonna say that we're sense-making beings.

1019
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,040
I mean, we make sense out of all of our experiences,

1020
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,360
and he goes through in very complex detail

1021
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,120
what these structures are,

1022
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,400
and kind of what the holistic structure of them is.

1023
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,320
And so we have feeling, I mean, we have a thinless sky,

1024
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,920
and that's one of the important things for my work

1025
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,520
that I take from Hadegar is this idea that,

1026
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,520
and the thinless sky is often translated as attunement.

1027
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,800
And the popular translation is translated as state of mind,

1028
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,200
but it's a very terrible translation

1029
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,720
because Hadegar wanted nothing to do with states of mind.

1030
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,520
And so attunement might be a better word for now.

1031
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,160
Some people like to use this position,

1032
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,920
but it's really just the way you find yourself in the world.

1033
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,280
How are you attuned to the world?

1034
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,280
And it has connotations of feelings and emotions

1035
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,520
and that sort of thing.

1036
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,520
And so that's just one of many apriori structures

1037
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,640
that Hadegar is gonna talk about being attached.

1038
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,800
And how does, okay, so first question is,

1039
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,200
we talk about Hadegar's idea that we are being in the world,

1040
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,760
and he's trying to make the statement that,

1041
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,240
in fact, before we even think of our states of mind,

1042
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,200
our conscious experience,

1043
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,680
there are all these other structures

1044
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,200
that presuppose all of that.

1045
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,280
For us to even ask that question,

1046
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,120
what is existence, what is consciousness?

1047
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,640
There are many other things that come before that.

1048
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,680
And is that what he kind of means by,

1049
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,600
we are, obviously we're embodied beings,

1050
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,480
but we're also in the world amongst other beings.

1051
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,240
Yes, so being in the world, and it's all hyphenated.

1052
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,640
So if somebody's listening and they haven't seen

1053
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,000
the phrase written out in his book,

1054
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,720
being hyphened in hyphened the hyphenate world is one.

1055
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,400
And it's done that way because what Hadegar's trying

1056
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,840
to signify with that is a unitary phenomenon.

1057
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,840
He's trying to say, all of this comes together.

1058
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,040
It's all codependent, it's an interdependent phenomenon.

1059
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:32,720
We don't first exist and then try to find the world.

1060
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,120
And our world doesn't first exist,

1061
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,520
and then we kind of come into it.

1062
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,440
But there's a interdependence and kind of co-manifestation

1063
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,760
of existence and what he means by world.

1064
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,440
And that's what being in the world is.

1065
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,400
And so it's a holistic and interdependent sort of thing.

1066
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,800
So if you look at how that pertains to meaning,

1067
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,000
firstly, this is something I've struggled with.

1068
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,600
For Hadegar, it seems like there's a world of facts,

1069
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,520
but for the world to become true,

1070
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,040
for those facts to have a truthfulness,

1071
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,720
it requires a Dasein or a human being.

1072
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,760
Dasein is the term he uses.

1073
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,600
So then would he say that in some sense,

1074
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,320
reality truly became reality as we know it now,

1075
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,000
only after we came into being, we came to exist

1076
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,720
and we were being in the world?

1077
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,360
Or is that something he doesn't really talk about too much?

1078
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,120
So he doesn't talk about it a whole lot.

1079
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,600
There are some very, very difficult passages

1080
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,040
that are still disputed today.

1081
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,200
And I've had a lot of fun conversations

1082
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,680
about these passages because they are very difficult

1083
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,920
to try to discern what the heck he was meaning.

1084
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,600
He also uses the word world

1085
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,440
in three or four different ways in being in time,

1086
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,640
but he's very precise about when he uses them

1087
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,480
and he even tells you beforehand,

1088
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,480
like if it's in quotes, this is what it means.

1089
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,560
If it's capitalized, this is what it means.

1090
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,120
So he has a good system.

1091
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:20,120
He's not just erratic in throwing these words out there.

1092
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,600
He knows what he means by them

1093
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,680
and he tries to convey to us what he's meaning by them.

1094
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,000
But to get back to your question,

1095
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,400
yeah, in a very real way, what Heidegger is saying is,

1096
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,120
reality as we know it, the world as we experience it,

1097
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,640
the world as we articulate it,

1098
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,400
whether that's in, you know, as facts or not,

1099
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,560
only has been, it only is when Dazan is.

1100
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:59,320
And the question arises, well,

1101
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,200
if all human existence was to kind of fade out overnight

1102
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,920
where the world disappeared

1103
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,120
or whether there's still the world

1104
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,120
or whether there's still the entities,

1105
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,960
that sort of thing.

1106
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,960
And Heidegger stays true to the phenomenological approach here

1107
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,120
and he stays true to it in some other areas as well.

1108
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,560
And what I mean by that is,

1109
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,920
he doesn't give a definitive answer.

1110
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,920
He kind of just says, well, if we're not here,

1111
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,120
we don't really know what would be here.

1112
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,200
So because phenomenology is looking to experience,

1113
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,680
he can't make a phenomenological judgment about that.

1114
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,680
And he is honest about that.

1115
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,120
And then something that I appreciate about his approach

1116
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,120
is that he doesn't overstep the limits of the method

1117
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,200
that he's using.

1118
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,600
And I mean, philosophy has argued about that forever,

1119
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,960
whether the world exists independently or not.

1120
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,600
And what Heidegger just says as well,

1121
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,080
as far as our experience goes,

1122
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,360
and as far as the way we articulate the meaning of being,

1123
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,720
being only is while we are.

1124
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:22,720
And it's obscure and it's sometimes frustrating

1125
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,040
if you want a concrete answer

1126
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,760
as to the independence or not of the world.

1127
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,560
But he just kind of then follows up by saying,

1128
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,920
well, if we're not here, we're not really gonna know.

1129
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,160
And I don't think anybody's had an experience

1130
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,360
absent the world.

1131
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,600
And so I don't think anybody knows

1132
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,320
what the answer to that is.

1133
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,600
And so it's, to me, okay, so to me,

1134
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,200
I appreciate the enigma, I appreciate the mystery behind it

1135
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,760
because if we truly can't know,

1136
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,360
maybe we can think through it and have a discourse about it

1137
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:08,360
and it might be a very meaningful sort of thing

1138
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,800
to talk about, but because we can't know,

1139
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,040
we shouldn't pretend that we know.

1140
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:21,360
Yeah, or, I mean, perhaps it even,

1141
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,880
in some sense, Hattaker probably wouldn't even like us

1142
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,720
just talking too abstractly about such things,

1143
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,600
given that, again, like you said,

1144
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:35,600
he would want us to stick to the phenomenological approach

1145
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,080
where we're talking about structures of experience.

1146
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,200
And for starters, if there aren't any structures,

1147
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,040
there are some conversations we can't have

1148
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,920
whereas at one point, it just becomes the term you use,

1149
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,640
which I know is by Wittgenstein's language games.

1150
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,640
At one point, which is why sometimes I think of

1151
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,640
all these pop philosophy or pop science ideas,

1152
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,640
like the many worlds theory or brain in a bat or what else?

1153
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,920
Do we live in a matrix?

1154
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,920
They really seem like futile or even useless efforts

1155
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,880
or conversations to have because, again,

1156
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,360
it doesn't pertain to a palpable actual experience.

1157
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,480
It's just fully abstract.

1158
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,640
And again, nothing wrong with abstracts.

1159
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,240
Mathematics is fully abstract,

1160
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,120
but look at how useful mathematics is.

1161
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:30,120
But I'll get your point.

1162
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,560
I think you explained quite well.

1163
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:37,560
So Hattaker's idea of being in the world,

1164
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:42,960
how does that relate to what you've discussed here?

1165
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,280
Firstly, meaning and then,

1166
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,560
well, perhaps more, more specifically, human meaning.

1167
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,000
Sure.

1168
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,320
Yeah, and so I will also clarify

1169
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,040
since you added that caveat on at the end there,

1170
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,280
I really only talked about meaning in relation to,

1171
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,520
I have to pretend to humans,

1172
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,920
meaning in the lives of humans.

1173
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,440
I don't know if I'll ever transcend that

1174
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,400
and talk about meaning as such,

1175
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,480
but again, maybe that's not a phenomenologically appropriate

1176
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,000
topic because I don't know,

1177
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,040
outside of my human experience,

1178
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,360
I don't know what meaning might be.

1179
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,880
But so being in the world,

1180
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,320
I think it kind of at least starts to give us,

1181
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,560
well, for one, that's gonna be after you are a structure

1182
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,640
to having an experience of meaning.

1183
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,200
I mean, we're in the world,

1184
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,280
not in a sort of container-like way,

1185
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,880
like water is in the glass,

1186
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,880
but we're the world and us are co-constituted in a sense.

1187
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,680
And we have to,

1188
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:10,800
I'm trying to think about how I want to phrase this.

1189
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,840
I guess we have to involve ourselves in the world,

1190
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,160
like we're always being in the world,

1191
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,000
whenever abstracted away from the world

1192
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,880
or else we wouldn't be living in,

1193
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,040
where it would be an existing being.

1194
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,800
So it's not that we're never not being in the world,

1195
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,240
but I think it kind of points to this idea

1196
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,240
that us in the world are closer than we think

1197
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,960
and we're more interconnected than we think.

1198
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,520
And if we sort of explore with,

1199
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,400
we sort of explore the world

1200
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,880
and various involvements that we might have with it,

1201
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,120
we might stumble across something

1202
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,320
that we find extremely meaningful.

1203
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,840
And I think that's really the only way

1204
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,480
that we can discover meaning.

1205
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,360
I don't think we subjectively create meaning,

1206
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,480
but I don't think meaning is also just objectively

1207
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,320
out there in the world.

1208
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,440
I think it's a relational phenomenon.

1209
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,640
So I guess that the concept of being in the world

1210
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:07,120
also points to that idea that it's a interdependent

1211
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,480
and relational sort of thing.

1212
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,160
And we might also, in the process,

1213
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,240
discover a lot of things that we don't like

1214
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,720
and that we don't find meaningful

1215
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,320
or we find the opposite there that we find meaningless.

1216
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,240
But I think that's also just closer

1217
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,560
to what we find meaningful

1218
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,640
because you don't really know until you have the experience.

1219
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,600
You don't really know until you involve yourself

1220
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,840
in the activity or what have you.

1221
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,800
And so it's an experiential relational thing

1222
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,800
and being in the world is kind of just a necessary structure

1223
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,600
for us to be able to go out there and try to find meaning.

1224
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,880
If we weren't being in the world,

1225
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,080
we were not existing.

1226
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,600
That's well put.

1227
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,520
That is well, I think you hit the nail on the head there.

1228
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,200
So being in the world is, in fact,

1229
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,320
what's necessary to even discover meaning.

1230
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,560
Okay, okay.

1231
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,440
Because another thing I realized

1232
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,000
was perhaps one of the most important things

1233
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,360
Jerome Reiki did

1234
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,600
to the contemporary philosophical conversation

1235
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,840
is that he started asking the question

1236
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:30,120
from meaning of life to meaning in life.

1237
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,200
And Heidegger would probably fall on the latter camp

1238
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,040
where what he worries about

1239
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,240
or his concerns are meaning in life.

1240
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,520
For him, meaning of life is again,

1241
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,000
one of those useless questions.

1242
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,440
Yeah, and you know, Heidegger uses the term meaning a lot

1243
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,640
but he generally, what he means by that

1244
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,320
is generally the way in which I just used it,

1245
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,080
like the sense that something has,

1246
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,120
making sense of something.

1247
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,400
So the German term that he uses a lot of sin,

1248
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,080
S-I-N-N, and it can be translated as meaning

1249
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,200
but it can also be translated as sense.

1250
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:12,080
So Heidegger doesn't really talk about meaning in life

1251
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,240
as much as like making sense of things in life

1252
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,240
and making sense of the world.

1253
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,160
And that's another reason why I thought that

1254
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,040
because I think Heidegger gets a lot of things right.

1255
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,360
I think he gets a lot of things correct

1256
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,960
with his fundamental analysis.

1257
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,440
And it's very like the fundamental structures

1258
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,800
that he's laying out seem,

1259
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,760
something seems true about them.

1260
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:37,280
And so because of that,

1261
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,440
and because he doesn't really talk about meaning in life,

1262
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,560
I thought his framework would be a really great framework

1263
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,000
to take over and to try to talk about meaning

1264
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,880
from within that existential framework

1265
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,000
because it is phenomenological.

1266
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,960
It is an experiential sort of phenomenon, meaning is.

1267
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,360
And so almost,

1268
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,600
I guess taking what Heidegger has done

1269
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,400
and adding something to it,

1270
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,440
it's kind of what in a sense I'm doing.

1271
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,480
Yeah.

1272
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,840
Yeah, like all great thinkers, isn't it?

1273
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,320
Because Heidegger himself,

1274
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,960
even though he was trying to subvert whole of philosophy,

1275
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,320
he still was working off,

1276
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:27,640
like Aristotle or Kant or some great thinkers of the past.

1277
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,840
Okay, so this,

1278
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:34,160
I want to read out an excerpt from your essay.

1279
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,880
The reason being,

1280
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,520
I think the way you've put it here very much pertains to,

1281
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,520
so firstly, this is a small statement you've made

1282
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,960
in regarding apropos time

1283
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,440
and you've discussed how time would differ

1284
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:53,080
for a phenomenologist from, let's say, a scientist.

1285
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,680
And then you put and you've written

1286
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:59,680
and you've quoted Heidegger in that statement you've made.

1287
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,080
And I think that statement itself

1288
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,040
is more of like a sobered example as to,

1289
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,240
it probably answers a lot of questions

1290
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,400
that we were discussing, for example,

1291
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,120
the difference between phenomenology and science

1292
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,240
or if there is this stark difference

1293
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,160
and then how that relates to meaning and whatnot.

1294
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,040
So firstly, I'll read out the statement

1295
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,680
and then I'll ask the question.

1296
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,560
So here's what you've stated, Jacob.

1297
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,920
For Martin Heidegger,

1298
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:31,440
past events are always projected into the future,

1299
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,480
while also existing presently as having been.

1300
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:40,160
The future is not later than having been

1301
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,080
and having been is not earlier than the present.

1302
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:48,280
What was having been arises simultaneously

1303
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,600
with the present and the future

1304
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,920
and human being is always towards,

1305
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,240
toward itself in anticipation of the possible ways of being.

1306
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,240
The Heideggerian concept of time

1307
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,120
frees the phenomenologists from thinking

1308
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,200
of past, present and future

1309
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,400
as sequentially ordered groupings of distinct events.

1310
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:16,240
So saying that, how does a phenomenologist

1311
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,960
or a Heideggerian view time and meaning

1312
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:23,040
and how that pertains to a human being

1313
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,160
from let's say an analytical philosopher or a scientist?

1314
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,960
So a common theme in Heidegger

1315
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,960
is this idea of primordial phenomenon and deriving.

1316
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:43,040
You may have to explain that term, primordial phenomenon.

1317
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,760
So basically, what he means by that is

1318
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:53,080
the more basic, more fundamental structure,

1319
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,720
I guess, what you could say.

1320
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,560
And because it's a phenomenological structure,

1321
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,000
it's gonna be an experiential thing.

1322
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,920
And Heidegger thinks that a lot of the things

1323
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,080
that we have theories for now,

1324
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,400
were derived from something more basic

1325
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,640
that we had an experience.

1326
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,800
And time is one of them.

1327
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:21,800
And so like the sort of everyday notion of time that we have,

1328
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:26,400
which I think at the end of that paragraph

1329
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,560
that you read, kind of talked about it

1330
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,560
as far as like the sequentially ordered groupings of events.

1331
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,060
So the idea that there's a future moment,

1332
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:39,340
that's coming into the present

1333
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:43,140
and then it's going to vanish into the past

1334
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,740
and be gone forever.

1335
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:48,300
So that's sort of everyday thinking about time and clock time.

1336
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:52,260
Heidegger's gonna refer to as bolder time.

1337
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:55,660
It's a derived mode of time.

1338
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:58,420
It's not the primordial phenomenon of time.

1339
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:05,100
And so he's gonna talk about this more basic idea of time.

1340
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,540
And he's gonna call it temporality talk.

1341
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:12,020
If I say time, think about, let's think about

1342
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:13,260
our everyday understanding of time.

1343
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:17,260
And if I say, we can't think about Heidegger's idea of time,

1344
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:20,360
it might just be easier for a sake of conversation.

1345
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:26,820
So temporality is obviously very important.

1346
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,860
He wrote a book called being and time.

1347
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,620
And so the second division of being and time

1348
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,700
really dives into the details of that.

1349
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,380
I'm not going to sit here and pretend that I could,

1350
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:43,500
that I know the exact meaning that Heidegger meant

1351
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,420
with his concept of time or temporality

1352
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:48,300
because it's very complex, very difficult.

1353
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,380
But what I can say is that the basic structure,

1354
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,980
the basic operator structures that he lays out

1355
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,660
in his existential analysis,

1356
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:01,660
each pertain to a specific aspect of temporality.

1357
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:08,860
So we have understanding as a a priori structure

1358
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,780
along with attunement, which I talked about a few moments

1359
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,020
a few minutes ago.

1360
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:23,820
And he also has fallenness or discourse.

1361
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:28,340
And basically what Heidegger says

1362
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,940
is that those three things come together

1363
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:35,940
to form the structure of disclosiveness,

1364
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:40,180
the way we disclose the world in a basic way.

1365
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:45,140
And each one of those pertains to a certain aspect of time.

1366
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:49,140
And so we have, we're kind of thrown in the world,

1367
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,140
we kind of find ourselves in the world

1368
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:57,300
and we have a past that we didn't really choose for ourselves.

1369
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:02,300
And we have the way we find ourselves in the world

1370
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,620
within the Skype or attunement,

1371
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:09,020
kind of the way we're currently attuned

1372
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,740
and dealing with the world.

1373
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:14,340
And that's kind of going to point toward the present

1374
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,220
and then understanding is pointing towards the future

1375
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:21,460
because understanding, and this is not going to be,

1376
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,460
it's not a cognitive thing.

1377
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,180
I mean, Heidegger will say that because

1378
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:30,460
theories of cognition are going to come after this.

1379
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,940
So again, we're talking about the a priori structures

1380
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,380
that are required for you to be able to make up

1381
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:36,620
a theory of cognition.

1382
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,220
And so he doesn't want to,

1383
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,180
he doesn't want people to conflate

1384
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,500
what you mean by understanding.

1385
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,180
And he gives very specific definitions to all of his terms

1386
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,500
and sometimes it's confusing

1387
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,260
because we all think we know what we mean by understanding.

1388
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,740
So if I could use that.

1389
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:54,740
But through the structure and through understanding,

1390
01:12:55,940 --> 01:13:00,500
we find ourselves amongst a whole lot of possibilities

1391
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,300
and we're constantly projecting ourselves

1392
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,860
toward those possibilities,

1393
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:04,900
whether we know it or not,

1394
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,820
whether we're aware of it or not.

1395
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:11,980
And it could be mundane things such as,

1396
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:15,340
if I stand up right now and I go to walk

1397
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,340
to fill my water,

1398
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,500
I'm going to be using the door handle

1399
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,900
and I'm going to be doing a whole lot of things

1400
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,380
that I'm not really thinking about doing.

1401
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:30,580
But those are all possible modes of comportment,

1402
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,100
possible ways that I can comport myself right now.

1403
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:39,100
So I'm constantly projecting myself into the future.

1404
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:43,020
Now to give like, to try to give a better example

1405
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,580
of these three modes come together.

1406
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,420
Maybe we could talk about the harvest.

1407
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:51,420
Yeah, I was just going to ask.

1408
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,260
So the three modes, okay.

1409
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:57,660
Let's, how about we try to use the example of the artist

1410
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:01,460
to expound on what temporality is

1411
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:04,260
and expound on what hiding means by time.

1412
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:06,460
But then maybe break down,

1413
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,460
break down those three modes.

1414
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,840
Apropos the example of the artist.

1415
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:18,220
So let's just assume that we're talking about

1416
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:24,780
I'll call them a master artist,

1417
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:29,780
somebody that's practiced for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years,

1418
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:32,460
something they've been doing their whole life.

1419
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:38,620
They've built up certain habits, right?

1420
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:40,380
I mean, you don't get good at something,

1421
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:41,900
you don't learn how to paint,

1422
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,380
you don't paint your master,

1423
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:48,380
first time you spent decades of time practicing,

1424
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:51,180
making mistakes, and so on.

1425
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,300
During the time that you're practicing something

1426
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,140
and you're trying to master something,

1427
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:05,020
you're doing that, I mean, so let's say you're,

1428
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,220
somebody's practicing right now,

1429
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:10,620
they're practicing their skill in some art painting.

1430
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,300
And in a very real sense,

1431
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:19,220
the future is co-arising.

1432
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:23,100
And the way in which it's co-arising is

1433
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,980
they are cultivating an ability to do something.

1434
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:34,980
They're expanding the horizon of possibilities

1435
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:38,260
that they can project themselves upon.

1436
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:42,660
So through the present moment, the future is co-arising.

1437
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,180
And let's say after they moved in,

1438
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:50,180
they practiced, now they're the master painter

1439
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,660
and they're creating a masterpiece.

1440
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:57,260
In a very real way, their past is co-arising with them

1441
01:15:57,260 --> 01:16:02,260
at that moment in the sense that they have these techniques

1442
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:07,260
and they have a habitual way in which they use a brush

1443
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:10,220
to stroke the canvas.

1444
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:14,780
And they wouldn't have that without their past

1445
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,140
practice and discipline.

1446
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:20,180
And so the past is with them at every moment,

1447
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:24,460
that's with us at every moment, in the present moment.

1448
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:27,660
And then their future continues to co-arise

1449
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:30,980
because they're one brush stroke, two brush strokes,

1450
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:33,540
it's not their masterpiece yet,

1451
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:37,180
but in the process, the future,

1452
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,980
which will be their masterpiece is co-arising,

1453
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:43,700
being made possible through what they're doing right now

1454
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,300
and what they're doing right now was only made possible

1455
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:50,980
because of the past, which I'm saying the past,

1456
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:53,500
but I'm also saying it's still with them

1457
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,780
because it must be or else they wouldn't be a master.

1458
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:59,220
You can't be a master at something unless you have

1459
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,900
gathered up with you,

1460
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:04,820
years and years of practice.

1461
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,740
You're bringing all of this together

1462
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,580
in the present moment in this one.

1463
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:13,620
Which is why you say that it's not,

1464
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,860
in fact, let me read out a small excerpt here.

1465
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:19,420
You say that, during meaningful experience,

1466
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:23,380
this Hedigerian temporality displaces

1467
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:26,180
the vulgar understanding of time

1468
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:28,620
for the latter loses its significance

1469
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:32,780
when human being is immersed in the world

1470
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:36,500
through passionate, skilled and creative activity

1471
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,540
or during being with others.

1472
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:43,140
So the point is, to put it very, very colloquially,

1473
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:46,380
you say, I'm in love with a beautiful woman

1474
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:50,020
or when I'm in this, let's say, flow state or whatever,

1475
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:52,780
you lose track of time.

1476
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:57,420
I don't know where time goes and this is the kind of time

1477
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,860
that you're saying Hediger is talking about,

1478
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:03,860
not time in a linear sense where it's t equals zero

1479
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,740
and then it goes on from there.

1480
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:09,020
And it's hard for us because what's interesting

1481
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,740
about what I realized about Hediger is that

1482
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:14,220
once you get it, you get it.

1483
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,860
You're like, oh, it's obvious what he's talking about

1484
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,180
because it's a part of our experience, isn't it?

1485
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:22,340
But getting it is a hard part because we are so,

1486
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:25,420
we are so trained or we're so,

1487
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:29,420
let's say attuned to thinking a different way.

1488
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:31,980
So, hmm.

1489
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:35,420
Yeah, I think that's the beautiful thing

1490
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:40,420
about good phenomenology is that when you get it,

1491
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:43,260
you get it in a different way than you get

1492
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,980
a proposition that you're struggling with.

1493
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:50,980
Maybe you're struggling with this analytic proposition

1494
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:53,780
or this argument and eventually maybe you work it off,

1495
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:54,900
you get it, you understand it

1496
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,180
and you're like, okay, cool, I get it.

1497
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,700
But with phenomenology, I mean,

1498
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,460
a lot of times you do have to struggle with it.

1499
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,820
You have to struggle with Hediger.

1500
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,660
I struggled with him for a very, very long time

1501
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,060
before I understood anything.

1502
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:10,380
But once you get it, like you said,

1503
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:12,540
because it is a part of our experience,

1504
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:18,340
you're not just affected cognitively or intellectually

1505
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:22,700
by the understanding because it's deeper than that,

1506
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,820
the understanding, I mean, it feeds back

1507
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:27,540
into Hediger's basic structure that he's talking about.

1508
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,580
I mean, you feel it, you feel attuned to it.

1509
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:32,860
You say, oh my goodness, like I can see this in my experience.

1510
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:34,940
You know, like how did I not notice this before?

1511
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:36,900
Because again, he's pointing,

1512
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,620
he's trying to point to things in experience

1513
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:41,140
and there's something very powerful about that,

1514
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:43,580
in my opinion, over and above something

1515
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,620
that's just propositional that you can't experience

1516
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:48,380
for yourself or you can't notice or reflect on

1517
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:51,220
and say, yes, that is a part of the experience.

1518
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:55,420
And it's not surprising that the existentialist,

1519
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:58,580
Sartre, Dibabua, Kamu,

1520
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:01,380
were all heavily influenced by Hediger

1521
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,940
because they were, that was the question

1522
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,580
they too were trying to deal with,

1523
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,980
the philosophy they were trying to develop,

1524
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,180
was it was, well, the word itself is existential.

1525
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,780
There probably isn't any other word to describe it.

1526
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,300
Fantastic, that was a great explanation,

1527
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:22,700
especially the, I like the analogy of the artist.

1528
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:26,660
In fact, all great, great Hedigerian teachers

1529
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,340
or teachers who do teach Hediger,

1530
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,660
they, like the person that comes from my mind

1531
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:34,900
is one of my intellectual heroes, Hubert Dreyfus.

1532
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,340
It's how beautifully he,

1533
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:39,260
he first of all, he's thinking live,

1534
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:40,660
he's thinking out loud,

1535
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:43,820
but also he always tries to connect it to a phenomena,

1536
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,260
to a phenomenon,

1537
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,620
something that's palpable in our lives.

1538
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,420
How are we going with time, Jacob?

1539
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:55,100
We're about an hour, 20 minutes

1540
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,100
into the podcast, into the episode.

1541
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,300
Can we do a few more minutes?

1542
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,540
So how are you going with time?

1543
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,180
I'm good on time.

1544
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,580
Either talking to you today

1545
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:11,220
or I'm reading and working on the dissertation.

1546
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:14,820
So I have, as long as you are.

1547
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,220
Perfect, I appreciate that, man.

1548
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:17,780
I mean, look, I was thinking,

1549
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:21,380
as we did discuss before we started recording,

1550
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,580
I don't think we can go to all the questions,

1551
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:24,740
everything you've written,

1552
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:28,780
especially probably the paper I like the most by you,

1553
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:32,780
the reinstatement of existential meaning

1554
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:36,940
or passion as a disclosure of meaningfulness in life.

1555
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:38,420
That seems a very,

1556
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:43,380
perhaps a very contemporary topic to even talk about

1557
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:45,740
because passion seems to be something we talk about a lot

1558
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:47,860
in our culture these days.

1559
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,340
It'd be interesting to think of that

1560
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,420
in a phenomenological approach.

1561
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:51,620
However, saying all that,

1562
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:54,380
I would probably leave that to a whole other episode.

1563
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:56,900
So let's get to the one that you said

1564
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,620
is a good starting point to your work,

1565
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:00,980
which is your paper,

1566
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:02,460
Ontology of Meaning.

1567
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:07,740
So a lot of questions that I've written down on this.

1568
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,620
We touched on a lot of things.

1569
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:12,820
We spoke about phenomenology for sure.

1570
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:17,660
How about we talk about something a bit interesting?

1571
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:21,460
Firstly, like we did with the previous paper,

1572
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:23,860
let's just get what you were trying to convey in the paper.

1573
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:26,260
So what did you mean by Ontology of Meaning?

1574
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:29,180
And after that, I want to talk about authenticity

1575
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:31,660
because it seems like this idea of,

1576
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:34,020
just like there's this cliche corporate words

1577
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,060
like bring your authentic self to work

1578
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:37,700
or be authentic online.

1579
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:41,780
And it's perhaps worth diving into what is authenticity

1580
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:45,820
from more of an existential phenomenological approach.

1581
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:47,460
But sorry, I'm getting carried away here.

1582
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,980
Before we get there,

1583
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:51,340
your paper, Ontology of Meaning,

1584
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:53,700
what's the paper about?

1585
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,620
What were you trying to convey?

1586
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:56,860
And also if you could please,

1587
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,460
where can people find the paper,

1588
01:22:58,460 --> 01:22:59,980
either now or in the future?

1589
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:03,900
Sure, so that paper will be available

1590
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:08,020
in the first quarter of 2023.

1591
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:11,940
That's what I was told the anticipated publication date is.

1592
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:16,940
Basically, they just have to do some formatting

1593
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:20,700
and just wait for the next issue to be published

1594
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:21,700
and it should be out there

1595
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:24,260
at the Conan Tuss Journal of Philosophy.

1596
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:31,700
So in that paper, it's very apparent.

1597
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:34,220
I think, is it in the title, Ontology of Meaning?

1598
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,460
I've written that paper so long

1599
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,380
that I sometimes I forget what the heck I...

1600
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,980
I think, because the paper,

1601
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:43,420
the paper, in fact,

1602
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:45,220
I made a mistake when I read out the title.

1603
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,980
The name of the file was Ontology of Meaning.

1604
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:51,100
However, the title of the paper itself

1605
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:54,460
is Reinstatement of Essential Meaning.

1606
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:56,380
Yes, okay.

1607
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:58,140
So it was originally going to be named

1608
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,220
something about Ontology of Meaning.

1609
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:08,220
I was actually playing more into the philosophical tradition

1610
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,540
and I wanted with that

1611
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:12,220
with when I was starting the kid's day.

1612
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:13,780
And by that, I just mean,

1613
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:17,260
so kind of the traditional idea of Ontology

1614
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,340
is going to be very different

1615
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:20,260
than high-figures kinds of Ontology.

1616
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:27,300
And I won't go into the details of it too much,

1617
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:31,340
but generally in traditional philosophy,

1618
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:33,100
Ontology is almost like,

1619
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:36,020
you can almost take like an inventory of the world.

1620
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,740
So you have one category,

1621
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:40,540
broad category, Metaphysics.

1622
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:42,980
And then a step up from that,

1623
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:44,340
maybe you have Ontology,

1624
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:45,700
depending on how you want to define it.

1625
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,500
Everybody kind of seems to play with it

1626
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,740
a little bit differently.

1627
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:55,380
And in any case,

1628
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:56,500
I'll just move on because I guess,

1629
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,300
I fixed the title right before I submitted it

1630
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,300
because I was like, man, I don't want,

1631
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,460
you know, you start to notice your own mistakes

1632
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:06,940
sometimes as they're happening.

1633
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,140
So you're saying that you don't prefer

1634
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,500
using the term Ontology

1635
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:14,180
because you don't want to mislead the reader

1636
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:16,540
as to what high-figure means by Ontology.

1637
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:19,940
Is that why you wanted to change the name of the paper?

1638
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:23,100
Yeah, that's ultimately why I did end up changing.

1639
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,540
Well, and also because I was kind of thinking about it

1640
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:26,900
in a more traditional sense,

1641
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:31,100
almost like meaning was a specific type of thing,

1642
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,420
but it's not a thing, like meaning is not a thing.

1643
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,700
Absolutely.

1644
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,900
Giving that, I was kind of implying that

1645
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,340
with the title, as far as the traditional

1646
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:41,660
understanding of Ontology goes.

1647
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:45,820
And I really did not want to give that impression

1648
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:50,260
or implication that I was trying to call out meaning

1649
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:52,420
as a thing or an entity.

1650
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:56,940
Because I most certainly do not think that,

1651
01:25:56,940 --> 01:26:00,740
but in any case, then that paper, I was really trying

1652
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:08,940
I was trying to get across

1653
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:15,300
and how we might be able to begin thinking about meaning

1654
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,580
and more importantly,

1655
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:20,380
where we, well, I guess,

1656
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:22,740
less about where we might experience it

1657
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:26,740
and more about how we should be thinking

1658
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:31,740
about meaning if we want to actually talk about it

1659
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:36,020
in a genuine manner.

1660
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:38,860
And I say this because, and I go,

1661
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,740
I'm pretty sure that's the essay where I talk a bit

1662
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:45,220
about science and talk a bit about logic

1663
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:49,820
and I try to, I mean, it's really quick.

1664
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:51,420
I didn't have a lot of space to do this,

1665
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:55,220
but I try to point out the reasons why

1666
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:59,100
are the wrong frameworks where we're trying to discover

1667
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,740
meaning and talk about meaning.

1668
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:07,340
And why I did this is specifically with scientism,

1669
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,060
but with really any reductive,

1670
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,980
any scientist that's reductive,

1671
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:18,420
you have this idea that everything can be reduced

1672
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:19,460
down to a certain thing.

1673
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:22,740
So we can reduce things, a physical subject,

1674
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:26,700
things that chemistry or we can reduce things to our biology.

1675
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:33,860
And you pair that reductive approach with scientism

1676
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,700
or the idea that we're,

1677
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,860
and then just place in physics or chemistry or biology,

1678
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:50,580
you're gonna, there's no word for meaning anymore

1679
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:54,100
in that world, and meaning is considered non-existent.

1680
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:57,300
It's considered unreal, it's considered at best an illusion

1681
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:02,420
or some subjective manifestation made up by our minds

1682
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:06,980
as opposed to a real phenomenon.

1683
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:11,980
And so that paper was really trying to get that idea across

1684
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:16,340
and to try to point to phenomenology

1685
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:20,540
as a legitimate outside logic in science

1686
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:22,100
for understanding the world.

1687
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:27,100
And I argued for soul phenomenology,

1688
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:33,220
like only phenomenology approach,

1689
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:36,140
but phenomenology and other things

1690
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:38,740
because if ultimately, I think,

1691
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:41,860
a holistic approach is the best approach

1692
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:45,020
if you want to understand as much as you can.

1693
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:48,900
And so by placing phenomenology aside,

1694
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,740
things like science and logic,

1695
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:56,500
for as tools for understanding ourselves in the world

1696
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:01,300
and reality and by saying ourselves world reality,

1697
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:02,260
really just mean everything.

1698
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:06,620
I just mean that everything, our experience,

1699
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:08,540
the world, the cosmos, you know.

1700
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:09,780
All of being.

1701
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:11,140
Yeah, all of being.

1702
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:15,140
This is, I'm glad we're talking about this.

1703
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:17,500
Perhaps before we get to the, sorry, did I interrupt you,

1704
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,340
Jacob?

1705
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:19,300
I think you were not done.

1706
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,140
Were you done?

1707
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:20,980
No.

1708
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:21,820
Apologies if I did.

1709
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:23,940
Sometimes the connection, there's a bit of a lag.

1710
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:27,100
Okay, so this is interesting because you've said here,

1711
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,980
I wanted to ask from you,

1712
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:30,540
and this is very, very important, I think,

1713
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:33,980
because now, again, going back to a point I made before,

1714
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:38,980
it seems like science has taken the place of philosophy.

1715
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:41,740
And I think that's to our own peril.

1716
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:47,060
And you've said here, science is reductive.

1717
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:50,060
So it attempts to describe meaning, experience,

1718
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:54,420
whatever in a reductive sense.

1719
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:59,180
And then you've said it's trying to take a view from nowhere.

1720
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,380
However, this got me thinking,

1721
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:03,340
you made a really interesting point

1722
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:06,540
in your previous article that we discussed.

1723
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,260
And I'm going to read out an excerpt

1724
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:10,060
where you've said it, you put it this way.

1725
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:13,260
You've said, so this is, I propose this idea of science

1726
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:16,620
trying to be objective and taking a view from nowhere.

1727
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:21,620
You've commented on something by Ponty, by Molluponty,

1728
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,780
where you put differently.

1729
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:27,820
And as Maurice Molluponty made explicit

1730
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:31,460
in his preface to Phenomenology of Perception,

1731
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:33,460
this is really important what you've said here.

1732
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:37,940
The third-person perspective of science

1733
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:42,940
is only made possible through first-person human experience

1734
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:46,860
because we only achieve a third-person perspective

1735
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:51,340
via a collection of first-person human experiences.

1736
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:56,500
The subjective first-person experience then

1737
01:30:56,540 --> 01:31:00,900
is something that is both pervasive and inescapable.

1738
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,660
So this got me thinking,

1739
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:07,180
is it even possible for science to ever be objective?

1740
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:10,300
Can we have an objective science in the sense of,

1741
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:13,140
can we truly, given that we are designed,

1742
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:16,820
we are being in the world, have a view from nowhere?

1743
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:21,220
Oh, no, I think it's a myth.

1744
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:24,180
I think at best, we can have intersubjective knowledge.

1745
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:27,260
And I think that's what most people,

1746
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:32,020
not that they mean, not that they know that they mean this,

1747
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:33,700
but when most people say objective knowledge,

1748
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,340
what they're pointing to is intersubjective knowledge.

1749
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:38,980
Because, yeah, I mean, I don't think there's any way

1750
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:42,300
to get around what Molluponty pointed out

1751
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,140
in the preface to his book.

1752
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:46,140
There's no way of getting out of it.

1753
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:47,700
There's no way of getting around it.

1754
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:50,660
That's all we have.

1755
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,100
And so, if we're gonna collect up

1756
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,260
a bunch of subjective experiences

1757
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:58,980
and call them objective,

1758
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,780
what we're really pointing to is intersubjectivity.

1759
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:07,580
So a scientist would probably try to challenge you

1760
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:10,100
on that point, on account of that point, saying that,

1761
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:11,700
oh, no, in the scientific approach,

1762
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:13,620
we have the double-blind study,

1763
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:16,900
or we have rigorous empirical research,

1764
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:20,460
where when you present a paper,

1765
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,540
or when you have a hypothesis,

1766
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:25,260
it's picked on by many other individuals,

1767
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:28,100
many other, well, not individuals, let's say experts,

1768
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:31,540
in that field who try and break down your arguments,

1769
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:35,300
break down what one has asserted.

1770
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,740
And then why are this excavation,

1771
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:43,740
why are this breaking down or destructuring of a hypothesis,

1772
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:49,940
if that proves the falsity or the truthfulness

1773
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:53,260
of a certain hypothesis?

1774
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:55,700
And as scientists would try to counter you saying that,

1775
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:58,100
eventually, as we keep doing this,

1776
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:03,100
we get to this to put it plainly, view from nowhere

1777
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:06,260
or an objective approach.

1778
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:08,180
So how would you respond to that?

1779
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:16,620
I would, I guess I would respond by asking maybe some,

1780
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:24,140
a little bit of information about each of the experts

1781
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:28,460
in the field that was trying to check over the work

1782
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:32,060
and see if it works or not.

1783
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,260
Because I think by doing that,

1784
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:39,220
very quickly you get to the idea that another person,

1785
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:43,300
this is another dozen that has a perspective on the world.

1786
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:47,940
And so we're collecting his perspective and this,

1787
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:51,100
and we're collecting the next expert's perspective on this.

1788
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:56,100
And I guess I would conclude by asking where it is,

1789
01:33:56,940 --> 01:34:01,940
because if there is a view, it's a view from somewhere.

1790
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:05,340
A view implies work.

1791
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:07,580
You can't view something without a viewer.

1792
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:13,020
To have a perception there must be something perceiving.

1793
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:15,700
And so I think to further imply perspectives.

1794
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:21,540
And so I think it's not, I mean, I'm just objectivity.

1795
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:26,140
I know some people are opposed here

1796
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:27,420
and they want something more objective,

1797
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:32,420
but I just, there's no reason to believe

1798
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:35,460
that there's anything as such,

1799
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:38,180
because everybody who has ever said that

1800
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:42,220
is saying that from their given perspective.

1801
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,780
And so it's almost like a performative contradiction

1802
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,860
in a sense, like if you're going to argue for a view

1803
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:50,420
from, you can't actually show the view from nowhere.

1804
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:55,420
And if you, to have a view is to experience some things,

1805
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:03,900
to be an experiencer, then I think it's just,

1806
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:09,460
you get, and so I guess, yeah,

1807
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:13,380
I guess that's, I would just try to respond in that way.

1808
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:16,900
And then if they can back and push back them.

1809
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,460
I'm not much of an arguer.

1810
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:20,900
I don't like arguments and things.

1811
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:23,540
A fair enough, but I tend to be quite,

1812
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:25,260
you and I probably are a bit different on that

1813
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:28,580
because I tend to be quite confrontational with these things.

1814
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:32,900
Yeah, because it is interesting

1815
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:37,540
because I even at like leaving maybe at a bit of a higher,

1816
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:40,780
more like a cultural level, we have a lot of these things,

1817
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:44,700
you know, even in politics or whatever people say,

1818
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:48,780
I speak the truth, unbiased facts.

1819
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:52,940
I throw facts at you or what's this by the Ben Shapiro guy,

1820
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:54,620
facts don't care about your feelings,

1821
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:56,260
all these such things.

1822
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:59,820
But it seems like people don't even question the words

1823
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,540
they use as in, what do you mean by facts?

1824
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:02,820
What do you mean by truth?

1825
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:08,140
And it even gets the idea of, you know,

1826
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:12,220
what can't try to describe in his critic of pure reason,

1827
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:14,860
there's pneumonia and phenomena.

1828
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:19,860
And there are certain things that we can never experience.

1829
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:24,820
They are more like upper right concepts.

1830
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:29,820
And it does, but then, I don't know,

1831
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:31,940
but then I wonder if like a Heidi Gehran would ask,

1832
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:35,060
oh, in fact, no, the pneumonia itself doesn't exist

1833
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:39,980
without someone being able to view it or perceive it.

1834
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:45,700
Yeah, so that's a good question.

1835
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:49,500
Yeah, I think, so for Heidi Gehran,

1836
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,540
there's no two-world model.

1837
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:56,100
I guess I always refer to like some distinction there,

1838
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,700
two-world model, because you have like,

1839
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:00,540
yeah, things and they appear a certain way,

1840
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,580
but then you also have these things behind them

1841
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:04,540
and that's like something else.

1842
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:05,900
And you can't get to that.

1843
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:06,740
You can't get to that.

1844
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:09,340
So I refer to it as two-world model

1845
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:11,300
because you have the appearance that you can get to

1846
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,100
and you have this hidden world that you can't get to.

1847
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:16,700
Yeah.

1848
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,300
And Heidi Gehran has the single-world model.

1849
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:22,540
Yeah, he was very much opposed to the Cartesian approach

1850
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:23,860
in that sense, wasn't it?

1851
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:28,260
Okay, here's an interesting one.

1852
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:30,220
You've spoken about authenticity

1853
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,340
in your paper, Ontology of Meaning,

1854
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:33,660
oh, sorry, not Ontology of Meaning,

1855
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:35,780
you've spoken about authenticity.

1856
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:38,380
You've spoken about authenticity in the paper,

1857
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:42,060
the re-instatement of Existential Meaning.

1858
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,860
I know I read that out a couple of the times,

1859
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:48,420
it's just to clarify what we're referring to.

1860
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:50,380
So when it comes to the topic of authenticity,

1861
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:52,700
it's something we hear very much in,

1862
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:53,660
it's quite pervasive.

1863
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:58,180
We hear it quite a lot in the contemporary online conversations.

1864
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:00,380
As I said, a lot of corporations talk about

1865
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,980
bring your authentic self to work.

1866
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:06,060
For a Heidi Gehran or a phenomenologist,

1867
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:09,220
what is authenticity?

1868
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:11,060
And perhaps more importantly,

1869
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:14,100
how is there a distinction between,

1870
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:17,380
let's say Saad's view of authenticity

1871
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:19,100
to what Heidi Gehran talks about?

1872
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:22,620
That is if there is a difference at all.

1873
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:29,580
So Heidi Gehran's understanding of authenticity

1874
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:35,580
is going to be related to, we talk very minimally,

1875
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:41,460
but I guess maybe we talked about possibilities

1876
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:45,260
and we're always projecting ourselves on possibilities.

1877
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:47,340
And so Heidi Gehran thinks that,

1878
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:52,540
okay, so let's talk about authenticity first,

1879
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:55,220
because it'll be easier to get to authenticity

1880
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:57,700
because Heidi Gehran thinks that we're all,

1881
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:03,700
all of us are most of the time living

1882
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:05,380
in an inauthentic manner.

1883
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:08,980
Now, Heidi Gehran doesn't place any judgment

1884
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:10,860
on authenticity or inauthenticity.

1885
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:12,980
He's just kind of saying like,

1886
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:16,180
this is the way I'm describing things

1887
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:20,260
from this phenomenological approach.

1888
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:23,900
So he's not saying that one's good or bad necessarily,

1889
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:26,180
but of course we all have connotations

1890
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:27,660
associated with those terms.

1891
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:32,980
So by living inauthentically,

1892
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:34,540
basically what Heidi Gehran's talking about

1893
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:39,540
is where we're in a fallen mode of being.

1894
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:41,820
And that's always a possibility for us.

1895
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:47,500
And really what that just means is we're absorbed

1896
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:52,500
in Das Man, which can be translated as the anyone

1897
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:54,500
or the they.

1898
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:58,500
And that's just, it could be anyone.

1899
01:39:58,500 --> 01:39:59,580
It's kind of like group thought.

1900
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:01,140
You can think about it as like group thought

1901
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:03,700
or group thinking is kind of the way.

1902
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:08,140
So if you come across phrases like,

1903
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:13,700
this is what one does in this formal setting.

1904
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:16,740
Like that's another, if you hear that,

1905
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:17,980
everybody comes into that at some point

1906
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:21,060
where they're going to school or you're going to a restaurant.

1907
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:22,460
There's like, you behave in certain ways

1908
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:24,420
and you don't behave in other ways.

1909
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:28,740
And most of the time, I mean, a lot of times that's good.

1910
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:32,620
I mean, we have to have these cultural structures in place

1911
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:34,660
or else things would just be chaotic and hectic

1912
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:37,340
and nobody would get along at all.

1913
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:39,700
And everything would be in this.

1914
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:43,100
So it's a lot of the time, it's not bad to be inauthentic.

1915
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:50,020
But if you're just always inauthentic,

1916
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:52,980
then what you do and the possibilities

1917
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:54,460
that you project yourself upon

1918
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:57,780
and the understanding that you have of yourself in the world

1919
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:02,780
is given over to you from the day, from the group thought.

1920
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:06,740
You're not taking anything up as your own.

1921
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:11,740
You're not reflecting on things from your own experience.

1922
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:14,620
You're accepting what they say

1923
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:16,260
and you're doing as they do.

1924
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:18,220
And if you're doing as they do

1925
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:20,020
and you're accepting what they say,

1926
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:24,220
that's why it's called sometimes translated as the anyone

1927
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:26,620
because it could be anyone, you could be anyone.

1928
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:28,540
I mean, you are anyone at that point.

1929
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:31,860
There's really no individuation between you and someone else

1930
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:36,860
if you're both functioning in that sort of mode all the time.

1931
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:43,260
And so that's just, I guess, a very crude way

1932
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:45,580
to describe inauthenticity.

1933
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:50,580
And so to project yourself authentically

1934
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:58,100
to, I guess, even become aware of your authentic possibilities,

1935
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:03,300
you have to, in a sense, distance yourself

1936
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:07,180
from the world of the day, from the anyone.

1937
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:11,460
You have to sort of quiet the group thought

1938
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:12,540
in the group chatter.

1939
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:19,620
And High Digger says that, he says one way of doing that is by,

1940
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:24,580
is through, I mean, actually it's,

1941
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:28,820
so this is where his concept of angst and anxiety comes into play

1942
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:33,820
because he says during these experiences of intense angst

1943
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:40,300
and anxiety, you almost come into contact

1944
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:46,020
with and experience nothingness in a sense.

1945
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:50,220
And this is more akin to, I think,

1946
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:54,140
what maybe what we would call it in contemporary,

1947
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:56,860
like severe depression rather than just anxiety.

1948
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:01,460
And so if you think about the severely depressed,

1949
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:06,220
they're almost, in a sense, living in a different world

1950
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:10,900
in the sense that they're not making connections

1951
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:15,380
in practical references as they would in their everyday life.

1952
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:18,620
Like things don't necessarily, things kind of like start,

1953
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:20,300
they begin to fail to make sense.

1954
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:24,180
And it's difficult for you to do very basic,

1955
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:26,980
practical everyday things if you're severely depressed.

1956
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:29,380
And somebody, anybody who's had these experiences

1957
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:30,900
can probably relate.

1958
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:33,340
I've had these experiences throughout my life.

1959
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:38,460
And the reason why this is,

1960
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:43,860
why this might get you toward authenticity is because

1961
01:43:43,860 --> 01:43:48,860
during those experiences, the world is quiet

1962
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:54,500
in the sense that you're not just running from one thing

1963
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,580
into the next, into the next, into the next

1964
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:59,620
as the public interpretation would happen.

1965
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:01,540
Or you're not just doing as one does,

1966
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:04,380
you're probably just sitting in a room by yourself

1967
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:06,580
and not knowing what to do or what to think.

1968
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:13,340
And so that's one way that Heidegger will say,

1969
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:17,060
you can distance yourself from public opinion

1970
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:20,860
and public chatter and public interpretation

1971
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:24,180
and understanding if you experience this.

1972
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:29,180
And I guess on the other, the next step of that is

1973
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:33,900
realizing or coming to terms with your own death.

1974
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:38,500
And kind of reflecting upon your own death.

1975
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:43,500
Because Heidegger says that that's the only truly,

1976
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:52,100
that's the only truly self-owned possibility

1977
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:55,540
in the sense that it's your possibility

1978
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:59,460
and it's no one else, it's nobody can die for you.

1979
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,380
I mean, if they die, you don't die.

1980
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,180
So they're technically not dying for you.

1981
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:05,220
Nobody can take over your death.

1982
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:08,660
When you die, if you were, you have to die the death

1983
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,500
or you're not dead.

1984
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,700
And Heidegger talks about this as the,

1985
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:14,900
he talks about death as the impossibility

1986
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:19,380
or the possibility of the impossibility of existence.

1987
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:20,500
Again, because he's staying true

1988
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:21,820
to the phenomenological method.

1989
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:26,340
So the possibility of the impossibility of existence.

1990
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:28,180
Because Heidegger is not gonna say

1991
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:29,420
what he thinks happens after death

1992
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:31,020
because he hasn't experienced it

1993
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:33,160
and it's not a phenomenological,

1994
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,440
it's not a thing to talk about.

1995
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:38,400
And so he says that it's possible that when we die,

1996
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,080
maybe we won't exist.

1997
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:43,240
And that's kind of where he leaves it.

1998
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,000
But by coming to terms with this

1999
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,240
and the way that Heidegger describes,

2000
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:50,680
which is essentially, it's my death and it's my own

2001
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,400
and it's nobody else's death.

2002
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:57,400
That's the first glimpse of what he's going to say,

2003
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:00,640
what he's gonna term authenticity

2004
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:04,160
because it's my own possibility.

2005
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,160
Okay, well, this is my own possibility.

2006
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,880
Maybe I have other possibilities that are my own,

2007
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:12,000
not anybody else's.

2008
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,600
Maybe what might those possibilities be?

2009
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,920
And then maybe you can start to think about

2010
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:20,760
how you want to live your life

2011
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:25,320
rather than how they want you to live your life.

2012
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:29,720
And you can begin to construct an existence,

2013
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:32,000
the way that you would like,

2014
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
as opposed to the way that they would like.

2015
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:36,880
And through doing that,

2016
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,760
you begin to reveal authentic possibilities for yourself.

2017
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,160
They can project yourself upon,

2018
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:44,840
whether it's taking up a certain discipline

2019
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:47,720
or for me, it was doing philosophy.

2020
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:52,720
I actually started my formal education in a different field

2021
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:56,480
and really looked philosophy,

2022
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,720
but everybody said that's what I should not be doing

2023
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:01,680
in a formal setting.

2024
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:04,280
I should get educated so I can make money.

2025
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:06,760
And so, and I did listen to what they said

2026
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:08,880
for a very long time and then eventually I said,

2027
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,200
you know what, I'm just gonna do this.

2028
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,400
I can't stop reading this.

2029
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,040
I can't stop thinking about this.

2030
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:16,040
I'm obsessed with philosophy.

2031
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:19,800
I don't know if I can force myself to go to school

2032
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,800
for anything else, so I'm just gonna do it.

2033
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:27,280
And so, I guess I like using that example

2034
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,920
because it was very obvious to me

2035
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,920
that I was being directed by popular opinion

2036
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,600
and what they think I should be doing.

2037
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:43,520
And then when I took over my existence as my own

2038
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:46,120
and whatnot, then I started to

2039
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:49,960
reveal these authentic possibilities for my existence.

2040
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:54,400
And so really what authenticity for Heidegger means

2041
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,080
is importing yourself in a way

2042
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:02,000
that is unique to your own existence

2043
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,240
and in such a way that you've chosen those possibilities.

2044
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:07,880
You've taken them over as you're on your take.

2045
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:09,480
And so responsibility comes in here

2046
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:13,640
because if you're just doing whatever you want on a whim,

2047
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:17,320
that's not a very great way to live either.

2048
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:19,080
You might think you're being authentic,

2049
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,840
but you really don't have a self at that point.

2050
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:23,200
I mean, you're not cultivating anything.

2051
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,120
In any real sense.

2052
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:28,840
And so maybe you're doing what you want to do,

2053
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:33,840
but you're not manifesting an authentic self

2054
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,560
in the way that Heidegger would say

2055
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:40,880
that you need to if you're gonna be authentic.

2056
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:45,880
However, does Heidegger place any moral judgments

2057
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:49,160
on the concept of authenticity itself

2058
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:52,360
for a design or a human being?

2059
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,680
In contrast, let's say someone like Sarth,

2060
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:59,560
who does seem to, he calls it bad faith to be inauthentic,

2061
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:02,800
who does seem to play some kind of moral judgment

2062
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,760
despite him not being a fan of moralism

2063
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,800
into authentic experience.

2064
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:12,800
And I guess I'm trying to ask is there even a difference

2065
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:14,840
between Heidegger's version

2066
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:17,040
and Sarth's version of authenticity?

2067
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:21,440
I'm not incredibly familiar with Sarth's version.

2068
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:26,080
I feel like if I don't want to say anything that,

2069
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:28,600
yeah, I guess I just,

2070
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:31,400
I guess I want to refrain from commenting

2071
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,640
because I don't know enough to say

2072
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:37,560
whether or not they could basically be considered the same.

2073
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:39,560
The only thing that I will say is that,

2074
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:47,600
I know Sarth did misinterpret Heidegger on a few things.

2075
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,040
And one of those things was the way

2076
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:52,760
in which Heidegger was using the term as essential.

2077
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,880
And if we're talking about existential possibilities

2078
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:57,920
and how important existential possibilities are

2079
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:00,520
for Heidegger's idea of authenticity

2080
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:04,080
and if Sarth did misinterpret Heidegger on that point,

2081
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,960
then I would think there would be a difference

2082
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:10,160
and maybe an important distinction

2083
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:12,680
to make between the two concepts of authenticity,

2084
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:15,480
but I don't know for certain.

2085
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,480
But does Heidegger himself place

2086
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:22,040
any kind of qualitative differences?

2087
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:23,280
I don't want to use the word moral.

2088
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:24,520
Let's say qualitative difference

2089
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:27,560
between being authentic and inauthentic.

2090
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:32,600
No, no, he doesn't.

2091
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:37,640
And I think the reason is because we,

2092
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:45,080
even if we're aware of our possibility

2093
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:49,000
for authenticity and even if we're living an authentic life

2094
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,080
most of the time, we're still participating

2095
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:58,080
in cultural structures that would be considered inauthentics

2096
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:03,760
by Heidegger's thought on pretty much an everyday basis.

2097
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:08,760
And it's not a bad thing to be doing.

2098
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:10,240
It's necessary.

2099
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:16,880
We're taught when we're children

2100
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,800
to look both ways when we cross the road.

2101
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:21,840
What one does before they cross the road.

2102
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,000
Yeah.

2103
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,880
So even these very mundane things

2104
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:27,600
that you wouldn't really think about

2105
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:31,960
in this philosophical capacity would be lumped into this idea

2106
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:36,960
of things, it's all term inauthenticity this way.

2107
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:42,040
Things that we've taken over from history

2108
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:44,560
and culture and society

2109
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,960
as far as ways to act and ways to think about things.

2110
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:51,200
And it's not a bad thing.

2111
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:54,720
I mean, I don't, I think we should all still look both ways

2112
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:56,320
before we cross the road.

2113
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,160
Yeah.

2114
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:58,560
That's what's prescribed.

2115
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:01,320
Yeah, another great example of Hubert Raphis.

2116
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:03,760
I believe it's Hubert Raphis, pretty sure it's him.

2117
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:08,760
He uses on the phenomenon is when you get into an elevator

2118
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:11,920
the distance you stand from other people

2119
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:14,480
and he says that that can culturally differ in fact.

2120
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:16,560
So when you get into an elevator

2121
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:19,840
some people don't mind being a bit too close to each other

2122
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:22,520
whereas perhaps in Western countries

2123
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:25,160
we would prefer having a bit of space

2124
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:27,240
and we wouldn't want to be too close to another person

2125
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:30,000
whereas I remember growing up in Sri Lanka

2126
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,120
if you even take public transport

2127
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:35,680
the other guy is just breathing down your neck

2128
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:37,280
right next to you.

2129
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:40,800
You wouldn't even see that here in Australia for instance.

2130
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,960
Yeah, and again, those just because we're a part

2131
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:47,840
of certain kinds of cultural practices does not make,

2132
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,120
that is yes, inauthentic, but I wouldn't,

2133
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:54,360
how would I say that makes you a morally inferior person?

2134
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:56,400
Well, he doesn't make moral claims for starters

2135
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,880
but he wouldn't even try to place any kind of

2136
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,000
qualitative judgment on it, isn't he?

2137
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:05,000
Yeah, yeah, so sometimes there's,

2138
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,680
I mean, the terms are so, they're translated

2139
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:11,680
as authenticity and authenticity so much

2140
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:14,000
that I think it would be difficult to get away

2141
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,720
from that particular translation of them

2142
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:21,720
but another possible translation of the term

2143
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:26,680
that he uses in German for authenticity,

2144
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:30,080
I mean, you could translate it as oneness or,

2145
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:35,080
so it could be like something that you chose

2146
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:38,960
like in a self-owned manner or something like that.

2147
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:42,280
And so like inauthenticity, you know, might be just,

2148
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:47,280
it's a thing that you're doing that you didn't really,

2149
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:52,120
you weren't the original agent to prescribe that

2150
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:55,560
or something, you know, I mean, it's kind of difficult

2151
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:57,240
to talk about without just using the terms

2152
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:58,760
that are always used in the translations

2153
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:03,680
but I feel like in the original language,

2154
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:07,000
it wouldn't have such heavy connotations as it does

2155
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,280
in Western culture as far as like acting authentically

2156
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:12,640
as something you must do all the time

2157
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:14,440
and you must always avoid it.

2158
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:18,360
Yeah, and the problem is again with authenticity

2159
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:20,200
or even passion, which we can get to,

2160
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,520
hopefully in the next conversation I check it,

2161
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:25,360
is that it's a colloquialism, it's used

2162
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:29,080
so it's pervasive colloquially and it comes

2163
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:33,000
with a lot of baggage, so it's a bit hard to,

2164
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:35,280
here's where I really wish that I learned,

2165
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,440
I could speak German.

2166
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,720
In fact, I'm trying to learn French

2167
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:40,520
to read some of the French philosophers

2168
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:44,400
but maybe one day in life, who knows, maybe even German.

2169
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:49,480
Oh, yeah, mate, so look, that was fantastic.

2170
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:52,200
I am really feeling refreshed

2171
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:54,120
and I would even say to a certain extent,

2172
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:55,840
I think I'm in the flow state right now,

2173
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,800
so I'm just really, really feeling it.

2174
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,960
I don't think we'll have time to go through all the paper

2175
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:06,400
and in fact, just to give it the time that it deserves,

2176
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:10,760
I wanna probably have a separate episode on that.

2177
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:14,600
We're coming to the two-hour mark

2178
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,720
or we've even crossed two hours now.

2179
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:19,040
Maybe to kind of, as like a conclusive statement,

2180
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,440
more of just practical advice.

2181
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:24,360
As someone who studies philosophy, as a writer,

2182
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:28,880
I would ask you a two-part question.

2183
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,800
What advice would you have for people like myself,

2184
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:34,240
in your fights, or even just people

2185
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:35,720
trying to get into philosophy

2186
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:37,880
on how to study philosophy?

2187
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:40,440
And secondly, what advice would you have

2188
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:42,760
on writing philosophy?

2189
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:48,840
So as far as studying philosophy goes,

2190
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,880
it's always a good idea to have an understanding

2191
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:56,120
of the history of philosophy.

2192
01:55:56,120 --> 01:56:00,560
That way, you kind of, so getting an idea of the history,

2193
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:04,840
if you reflect on that sort of study,

2194
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:09,040
you start to come to certain realizations

2195
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:14,040
as far as maybe how one idea inspired another idea.

2196
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:21,520
And you also get an idea of what's been said already.

2197
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:25,840
So, okay, so when you get into philosophy,

2198
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:27,120
sometimes it happens where you think

2199
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:29,120
you have a really cool novel idea

2200
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:30,000
based on something you've read,

2201
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:33,000
but then you realize that somebody else also said that

2202
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,440
like a thousand years ago.

2203
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:37,880
And so, the thing of the history is good for that reason too.

2204
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:41,600
So you're not just spending time reiterating something

2205
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:44,440
that somebody's already done a thousand or 2,000 years ago.

2206
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:50,120
It also gives you an idea that nothing is absolute

2207
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:55,120
in the sense that, I mean, you can see how much has changed

2208
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:59,800
over the centuries of philosophical thought

2209
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:04,800
and I think that's good for the ego,

2210
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:06,840
just to get a given understanding

2211
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:10,120
that they didn't have the absolute truth.

2212
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:11,800
I'm not gonna get the absolute truth,

2213
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:13,160
but we can think about these things

2214
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:16,680
and still maybe discern partial truths

2215
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:18,760
or something like that.

2216
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,200
I always like to have that in mind

2217
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,880
when I'm writing things or thinking about things.

2218
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:28,400
So any more, like when it comes to your process

2219
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:31,040
of reading, writing, what's the,

2220
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:33,600
how does it look like on a day-to-day basis?

2221
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:39,960
Consistency is, I think, what has helped me above all else.

2222
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:43,120
Like just reading a little bit every day

2223
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:45,280
or studying a little bit every day when you can't,

2224
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:46,720
like even if it's 20 minutes.

2225
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:48,240
So like the first thing,

2226
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:50,040
a lot of times the first thing I do in the morning

2227
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:55,680
is I listen to a lecture or I listen to part of an audio book

2228
01:57:56,280 --> 01:58:00,120
or a podcast, you know, where they're discussing certain things.

2229
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:03,720
Because that just really gets my mind going right away

2230
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:05,520
as far as thinking about these things.

2231
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:10,440
And the reason why I choose, sometimes I'm too tired,

2232
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:11,760
like for the first hour that I wake up

2233
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,320
that I can't really force myself to read,

2234
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:15,320
but I can listen to something.

2235
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:16,760
I can get my coffee.

2236
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:18,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can,

2237
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:19,960
I can listen and drink coffee.

2238
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:22,200
It's hard for me to read and make my coffee.

2239
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:27,480
So I think repetition or consistency

2240
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:30,600
and just persevering, like you think you don't understand

2241
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:32,920
some of the things, like don't just stop reading it,

2242
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:34,080
just read it.

2243
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:35,680
Even if you don't understand it, just read it

2244
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:39,280
because you might start to understand

2245
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:42,240
bits of it after you're finished.

2246
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:43,520
And even if you don't,

2247
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,800
things might start to make sense maybe months later

2248
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:47,080
or something like that.

2249
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:49,440
That's the experience I had with high degree in time.

2250
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:52,120
I read it once and came away from it saying,

2251
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:55,560
dude, I don't understand literally anything this guy said.

2252
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:59,440
But I feel like there's something really important here.

2253
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:03,600
And so I really dove into secondary sources and lectures

2254
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:06,200
and going through the book multiple times after that.

2255
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:10,960
And so I would say just read a little bit every day

2256
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:14,520
and make notes right in the margins of your book.

2257
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:15,760
If you have a physical book,

2258
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,960
don't try to keep your book super perfect and neat.

2259
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:22,840
Just start writing stuff down and highlighting stuff.

2260
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:25,560
If you have a question about something you read

2261
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:27,080
and it seems like it's a good question,

2262
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,680
write the question next to the paragraph in the book.

2263
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:32,440
I just doing small things like that

2264
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:34,320
has helped me a whole lot.

2265
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,600
Highlighting things you think are important.

2266
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:38,120
And then highlighting things in a different color

2267
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:39,840
that you just don't understand.

2268
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,960
You know, because you can go back through

2269
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:46,400
and you can, it has to be an active process, I guess.

2270
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,640
Maybe that's what I'm trying to get around to.

2271
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,640
It involves an active process.

2272
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:53,360
You're not just sitting there and taking in words

2273
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,440
that you're seeing with your eyes.

2274
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:58,360
It's an involved process of writing

2275
01:59:58,360 --> 02:00:00,280
and thinking and reflecting.

2276
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:03,760
And don't be concerned with reading too quickly

2277
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:06,760
or saying, it's taking me forever to get to the 10 pages,

2278
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:10,560
but it's gonna take me a year to read being in time.

2279
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:13,520
Just give it the time.

2280
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,800
It will be quicker and easier to read.

2281
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:18,120
And I just like to take the approach

2282
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,960
of giving things the time that they ask.

2283
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:22,200
They're gonna ask you for a certain amount of time

2284
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:24,320
and just give it to them.

2285
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:30,200
So do you normally pick a thinker

2286
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:32,720
and then study all of that thinker's work,

2287
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:36,720
the whole over of the thinker's work?

2288
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:40,440
Or do you rather pick, let's say,

2289
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:44,320
a fundamental philosophical text

2290
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:47,080
like it could be critique of pure reason

2291
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:50,480
or some of Plato's Republic, whatever it may be,

2292
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:53,320
and then focus on the text itself?

2293
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:55,960
Or are you more thinker focused?

2294
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:04,400
So really, I'm more thinker focused now

2295
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:09,240
than I have ever been, but previous to this,

2296
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:14,240
I almost always say I was thinking just broadly.

2297
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:17,360
Let's just say I was thinking about topics

2298
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,640
and philosophy of mine.

2299
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:26,280
And maybe I got intrigued by physicalism.

2300
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,680
Well, then I would go through and I would try to find

2301
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:33,120
what the history of physicalism was

2302
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:38,000
and what the major thinkers were in kind of read along

2303
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:42,640
the concept or the theory from a variety of perspectives.

2304
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,600
And then I really immerse myself in it

2305
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:49,320
and try to think from that perspective.

2306
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:51,560
And sometimes you do have to spend a lot of time

2307
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:54,400
to get to the added areas

2308
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:57,320
or to get attuned to that kind of motive thought

2309
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:00,000
so that you have to spend more time.

2310
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,960
But then after that, I would read the opposite view.

2311
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:06,400
Whatever the opposite view was,

2312
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:08,560
not necessarily just arguments against

2313
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:09,800
whatever position it is,

2314
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:13,880
but what's like a contrasting theory or idea.

2315
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:15,000
And then I would dive into that.

2316
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:15,840
And so I did that.

2317
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:20,400
Honestly, that's what most of my undergrad time doing

2318
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:25,400
was just like kind of juxtaposing theories and concepts

2319
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,600
with contrasting theories.

2320
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:30,440
And just trying to get a really holistic view

2321
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:32,000
of like why people think things.

2322
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:36,640
I don't have very strong opinions personally.

2323
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:40,200
It's easier for me to do that sort of study.

2324
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:43,800
I'm just, I'm always very skeptical of everything,

2325
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:46,600
but also myself at the same time and try to say,

2326
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:49,520
I mean, I can appreciate ideas that maybe I disagree with.

2327
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:57,040
And it'd be very difficult to say anything absolutely.

2328
02:02:58,360 --> 02:02:59,200
I could-

2329
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:01,040
Well, it's interesting though,

2330
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:06,040
I hear a typical trope by more public intellectuals

2331
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:11,400
is be skeptical, be open-minded, be critical,

2332
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:12,880
be objective, be rational,

2333
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:16,800
we hear all these terms thrown around quite a lot, isn't it?

2334
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:20,600
But it's also sometimes I think,

2335
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:25,200
I'm not trying to pick on a particular public intellectual,

2336
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:27,560
like someone like Steven Pinko or Sam Harris

2337
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:31,320
who constantly to almost like ad nauseam,

2338
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:33,880
talk about rationality and reason

2339
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:35,960
and being open-minded and whatnot.

2340
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:41,360
They also don't seem to get it that in fact, firstly,

2341
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:45,200
being skeptical, being critical is,

2342
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:47,040
it's a really difficult thing to do.

2343
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:50,840
It's in fact quite unnerving.

2344
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:53,480
It leaves one in this state of angst

2345
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:55,560
and there's no stability in one's life.

2346
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:00,120
And it's, if you truly authentically do it

2347
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:03,320
in a very genuine, sincere way,

2348
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:08,320
it can leave one unraveled, uprooted, you know?

2349
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:10,320
It's not an easy thing to do.

2350
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:14,040
No wonder you see, it's like what Dostoevsky said,

2351
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:19,040
it seems that men with large hearts and deep minds

2352
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:22,160
seem to be the most miserable.

2353
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:25,520
And I think he says that in common punishment,

2354
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:27,320
I'm paraphrasing him.

2355
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:30,960
And then also comes the other thing where even these,

2356
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:33,760
again, what should I call them?

2357
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,040
New Age Atheists, not New Age Atheists,

2358
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:39,320
like the New Atheists, so again, public intellectuals,

2359
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:43,440
they, for me, all of their skepticism,

2360
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,160
it's not skeptical enough.

2361
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:47,560
They still are very much a domain,

2362
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,360
their own domain of reason or whatever.

2363
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:53,120
It seems like they haven't explored many other areas

2364
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:57,520
that probably, then probably would even unravel them

2365
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:59,880
because all of their work would also then deconstruct

2366
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:00,720
and break down.

2367
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:04,560
And that's funny, because that's when you were talking

2368
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,080
about specifically proud of,

2369
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:07,240
I know you didn't want to pick on anybody,

2370
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:09,240
but when you brought up Sam Harris, you know,

2371
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:11,200
I just thought, yeah, he's always talking about

2372
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:12,120
people should be skeptical,

2373
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:16,120
but I don't think he's skeptical about his own thoughts at all.

2374
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:17,960
But just that, yeah, it's not for,

2375
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:21,000
he doesn't portray that, he doesn't give that impression.

2376
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:24,280
He never, he hasn't questioned himself enough to,

2377
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:26,840
for me to say, yeah, he's skeptical.

2378
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:29,040
I don't think he's very skeptical at all.

2379
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:31,400
Yeah, because it seems that, again,

2380
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:33,200
I don't know why, I guess this is a very arbitrary

2381
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:35,280
and just big Sam Harris, but even Sam Harris,

2382
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:39,400
he has his foundational like axioms he works of,

2383
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:41,960
but within those axioms, he will question,

2384
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:45,160
he'll be critical, but he never tries to break down

2385
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:47,240
those axioms themselves, which I feel,

2386
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:49,800
which is why I admire an intellectual like Heidegger,

2387
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:52,040
which is what Heidegger was trying to do.

2388
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:58,000
And that's, yeah, I guess all I would say,

2389
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,480
Jacob, especially, thanks a lot, man.

2390
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:02,440
I truly am grateful.

2391
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:04,680
As I said, I'm a complete amateur,

2392
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:07,640
so it means a lot that you shared your work with me,

2393
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:10,440
even the stuff that you haven't publicly published

2394
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:12,080
for me to go through and study.

2395
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I haven't read the whole of being in time yet.

2396
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:19,600
Slowly working my way through it, you know,

2397
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:21,720
plotting along, one could say,

2398
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:24,200
but it's a worthwhile journey.

2399
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:28,800
It's also something I've realized, I do it now more as,

2400
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,040
in some sense, it's like a moral responsibility

2401
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:33,320
that I'm obliged to do this,

2402
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:35,120
that I should make time for it.

2403
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:40,680
And that means spending a lot of time in solitude,

2404
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:44,480
not really getting out, but the point I was trying to make

2405
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,680
is I think you're a great thinker,

2406
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:49,400
you're a fantastic writer.

2407
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:51,120
We didn't really get much into the writing,

2408
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:52,360
hopefully in the next episode,

2409
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:56,440
but I can't thank you enough, Jacob, it means a lot.

2410
02:06:56,440 --> 02:07:00,840
You're a good bloke and I'm looking forward to the work

2411
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:03,800
you do in the future, more and more of what you write.

2412
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:06,520
And when you do write the,

2413
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:08,800
when your being in time comes out,

2414
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:13,120
let's have another episode and talk about your magnum opus.

2415
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:16,720
That's fair, sure, certainly, yeah, I really appreciate it.

2416
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:20,120
Thanks for having me on and chatting.

2417
02:07:20,120 --> 02:07:23,320
And I'll just reiterate something I said earlier,

2418
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:28,320
if you guys want to read any of the papers

2419
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:31,480
and I can't find them or can't get ahold of them,

2420
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:37,400
feel free to contact me and they'll be happy to be over.

2421
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:43,400
And again, I'm a better writer than I am a speaker, so.

2422
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:46,040
Oh, no, man, you did great, trust me.

2423
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:48,040
I am not good at neither,

2424
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:52,160
so you actually just got one thing to get out of the writing.

2425
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:54,360
But not just, Jacob, just on that note though,

2426
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:57,520
you said that your website was still under construction.

2427
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:01,720
So if I do leave a link to the website,

2428
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:03,480
it's probably not going to load,

2429
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:07,080
but is the domain going to be the same one

2430
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:09,760
or are you going to change it completely?

2431
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:12,280
The domain will stay the same.

2432
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:15,320
Yeah, the website is under maintenance right now.

2433
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:18,480
I'm kind of revamping it to,

2434
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:20,680
I'm trying to provide resources and information

2435
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:23,440
about phenomenology and existentialism

2436
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:25,960
and specifically meaning and meaningfulness

2437
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:30,800
and just trying to provide a little bit of direction

2438
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:33,600
for people that are looking to read more about the stuff

2439
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:35,560
and study it and yeah.

2440
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:38,520
So I can't say how soon it will be finished,

2441
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:42,000
but I would say it's not going to be

2442
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,800
more than maybe three weeks or four weeks from now.

2443
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:50,880
Fantastic, yeah, I'll try to get this up as soon as possible.

2444
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:55,200
In any case, I shall leave a link to your Twitter account

2445
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:56,440
or Twitter profile,

2446
02:08:56,440 --> 02:08:58,120
and then if people do want to get in touch with you,

2447
02:08:58,120 --> 02:09:00,720
they could contact you there, correct?

2448
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:04,080
Yep, certainly, yeah, and I think I might even have a link

2449
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:05,160
to my website on,

2450
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,720
if you don't put it on here or whatever,

2451
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:10,840
people can find it, I think on my Twitter.

2452
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:12,720
Perfect, thanks mate, cheers.

2453
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:15,720
I shall stop recording now, take care.
