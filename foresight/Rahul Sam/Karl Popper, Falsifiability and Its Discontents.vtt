00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
So, Professor Streamins, if you could start with Poppa and then, of course, the

00:05.760 --> 00:10.800
unfortifiability principle. Now, anyone could, I don't think it's that hard, even for a layperson

00:10.800 --> 00:15.680
like myself, to just Google what it means and get a very elementary understanding.

00:15.680 --> 00:22.400
So perhaps you could firstly just explain what the Kyle Poppa, Popperian unfortifiability

00:22.400 --> 00:28.800
principle is. But then also, as you've done in the book, rather well, maybe lay down some of your

00:28.800 --> 00:35.920
criticisms, criticisms of it just for the audience. Yeah, sure. So Poppa thought that really the heart

00:35.920 --> 00:42.160
of the scientific method was this very simple idea that if a theory makes a false prediction,

00:42.160 --> 00:49.440
it has to be wrong somehow. And Poppa thought that at the core of the scientific inquiry was

00:49.440 --> 00:55.040
the systematic elimination of all of the false theories. And notionally, of course, you could

00:55.040 --> 00:59.280
imagine one day having eliminated them all and just having one true theory remaining, although

00:59.280 --> 01:06.960
if Poppa was understood as well as anyone, that was not a realistic prospect. But he thought

01:06.960 --> 01:10.720
we could at least think of ourselves as making progress by eliminating the false theories.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.520
So the thing that makes that, oh, go ahead. No, I'm just going to ask, please continue.

01:15.520 --> 01:19.600
I'm not going to follow up on that, but keep going. Yeah. Okay. So the thing that makes that,

01:19.600 --> 01:25.520
though, now turning to where he begins to run into difficulties, and yeah, he had plenty of

01:25.520 --> 01:29.520
things to say about these difficulties. It's not as if this is some sort of one-shot

01:30.560 --> 01:37.360
undermining in his view. But it's really difficult when a theory does make a false

01:37.360 --> 01:42.720
prediction to figure out whether it was really the theory's fault or not. Science is such a

01:42.800 --> 01:50.480
complicated thing. And in particular, the kinds of measurement apparatus that are used to make

01:50.480 --> 01:56.480
observations in cutting-edge science are often very complicated, fragile things that only work

01:56.480 --> 02:04.320
when conditions are exactly right. 99.9% of the time, when you get a false prediction, it's not

02:04.320 --> 02:08.320
really the theory's fault at all. It's just that something went wrong with the apparatus. Or maybe

02:08.320 --> 02:14.160
you made a false assumption when you were making your calculations. Or maybe even, and this does

02:14.160 --> 02:18.720
happen, there's an error in the software that you're using to analyze your results. And so it's not

02:18.720 --> 02:22.560
really the theory's fault or not, and it would be a terrible mistake to throw away the theory,

02:22.560 --> 02:29.440
just because you got this false prediction. So if you're going to capture the spirit of

02:29.440 --> 02:36.560
Papa's proposal, you have to figure out some way of deciding when it's okay to just say,

02:36.640 --> 02:40.960
oh, something went wrong with the apparatus. And when you should say, ah, no, this time,

02:40.960 --> 02:45.680
it's the theory's fault. And so we've falsified the theory, as he says, we can throw away the theory.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.600
Sometimes, of course, you can just see that something went wrong with the apparatus.

02:50.160 --> 02:58.800
Like, you know, it's smoking, making, but often, in many cases in the history of science,

02:58.800 --> 03:03.040
we have results that were anomalous and looked like they cross problems with theories and we

03:03.120 --> 03:06.560
will never know what went wrong, because it's just too late to go back and check.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.160
I'm sure we'll probably end up talking about some examples later on, but

03:14.960 --> 03:22.320
but this Papa really never fully satisfactorily answered this question of when it's okay to blame

03:23.520 --> 03:27.280
the apparatus or other assumptions, and when you should blame the theory.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.960
I think he had, you know, he had interesting substantive things to say, but he didn't succeed

03:32.960 --> 03:40.400
in writing down what he was really after, which was a kind of a systematic calculus, if you like,

03:40.400 --> 03:46.160
for making these decisions, something that took these decisions out of the hands of scientists

03:46.160 --> 03:50.960
who might be indulging in motivated reasoning, you know, trying to see their own theory in a good

03:50.960 --> 03:55.280
light and just sort of said, no, you must follow this logic and this logic says your theory is wrong.

03:55.840 --> 04:01.680
Yeah, because I haven't read his book where he introduced the principle of what's it called

04:01.680 --> 04:08.320
the logic of science, I believe, but that's it. Yeah, I haven't read that book, although my

04:08.320 --> 04:14.160
understanding, again, at a very elementary level is that it seems that Papa really wanted some kind

04:14.160 --> 04:21.840
of a priori principle or even theory of science that allows scientists to do science. And then

04:21.840 --> 04:27.920
what you would argue for and many others would be that Oh, well, unfortunately, for better or worse,

04:27.920 --> 04:33.920
let's say, we haven't found that. Yeah. And so what you in fact have is, you know, I kind of made

04:33.920 --> 04:37.680
it all sound like more like a philosophical argument, but the fact of science is you have real

04:37.680 --> 04:44.160
arguments over these things should whether when to whether whether probably the result is just an

04:44.160 --> 04:49.440
artifact of some problem with the measuring apparatus or the theory really is in trouble. In fact,

04:49.440 --> 04:56.960
that's almost more normal than any other state of affairs. So some typically scientists who performed

04:56.960 --> 05:02.560
in perform the experiment will trust the apparatus more than the scientists sort of a few labs over

05:02.560 --> 05:07.200
who who weren't there to kind of see it all operating and so on. And you know, in the end,

05:07.200 --> 05:12.080
when if scientists keep going for long enough, there does seem to be a kind of a consensus

05:12.080 --> 05:16.560
that consensus that forms the experiments get done enough times been after different people.

05:17.440 --> 05:24.000
It's not as if it's we're just totally at sea, but it doesn't have this simple crisp objective

05:25.360 --> 05:29.360
algorithmic feel to it that Papa was really reaching for.

05:30.960 --> 05:36.080
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess that leads us to, I don't know if I should call it the antithesis,

05:36.080 --> 05:42.320
but at least let's say we'll juxtapose Thomas Kuhn's theory that the paradigm shift, the term that he

05:42.320 --> 05:49.280
popularized with the Popperian principle. Yeah, so the structures of scientific revolutions,

05:49.280 --> 05:54.080
perhaps my favorite book on philosophy of science, yours is a healthy contender.

05:57.440 --> 06:03.840
So in contrast to Karl Popper, Professor Srivence, what's, how does Thomas Kuhn differ? Because

06:03.840 --> 06:10.640
he came after Popper, isn't that right? So Papa was, Papa wrote his book

06:11.600 --> 06:17.360
in the 1930s and Kuhn wrote his book in the 1960s to give you some sense. So Popper is in a way,

06:17.360 --> 06:24.320
essentially, into war, I suppose we would now say, and Kuhn is very much post-war. And Papa was

06:24.320 --> 06:29.200
still kind of firing on all cylinders by then, but he wasn't presenting whole new ideas.

06:31.360 --> 06:38.480
Well, he was entitled to kind of have a break. So Kuhn's idea is actually, it doesn't dispense

06:38.480 --> 06:43.200
with the idea of a scientific method, as I was saying earlier, but rather the idea is that at any

06:43.200 --> 06:52.160
particular time period, a science, say, like particle physics, or molecular genetics, or

06:53.120 --> 06:58.720
economics, maybe microeconomics, will have a particular method, a particular set of rules

06:58.720 --> 07:02.560
for doing science, and actually a rather comprehensive set of rules for doing science.

07:03.520 --> 07:11.520
But that these methods are not fixed for all time. In fact, they change from time to time

07:11.520 --> 07:19.280
in dramatic episodes called scientific revolutions, or the phrase that Kuhn famously popularized for

07:19.280 --> 07:25.120
this is a paradigm shift. And the thing, the paradigm here is this kind of big method for

07:25.120 --> 07:31.680
doing science. And when it shifts, that means the old paradigm has crumbled, and a new one

07:31.680 --> 07:38.480
comes along and replaces it. So whereas Papa and sort of classic, the classic searches for a

07:38.480 --> 07:43.200
scientific method, we're looking for a single rule that is valid for all time, as you said,

07:43.200 --> 07:52.000
hopefully our priority, one that we can just know is right without, with certainty. Kuhn thought

07:53.120 --> 07:58.400
these these methods only last for a while, and then their scientists actually pushed them to

07:58.400 --> 08:02.560
the point where they're all of their flaws are exposed, because they're actually, they're very

08:02.560 --> 08:06.640
rich, but they're also kind of limited, they have a lot of assumptions built in, and inevitably

08:06.640 --> 08:11.040
some of those assumptions will turn out to be wrong. And so scientists pushed them to their

08:11.040 --> 08:18.800
breaking point. And in effect, they, they destroy their own methods by by exposing the

08:18.800 --> 08:24.080
faulty assumptions or whatever. And then some new method has to come along and supplant the old

08:24.080 --> 08:28.480
method, a new paradigm comes along and supplants the old paradigm, that's a paradigm shift,

08:28.480 --> 08:34.400
that's a scientific revolution, then you have a whole new methodological complex governing

08:34.400 --> 08:38.400
what scientists do in in whatever area of science it is.
