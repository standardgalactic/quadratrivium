0	7720	Hey everyone, welcome to my May 2023 book haul video. This one in particular, I'm gonna be quite happy.
7720	9720	My frugal ass is gonna be quite happy.
10280	14560	Specifically because of this pile here. I've got more books, but this pile here is
15240	21880	is making my frugal ass very happy given that all of this costed just I think less than $20.
21880	27200	So I got some some great books here, and I only paid 20 bucks for all of this thanks to
27680	35240	secondhand shopping that I went with with with a few friends. In fact, I looked up this sociology book.
35520	40960	It's just like a kind of like not a textbook really, but more as the title suggests the key concepts
41720	47760	by Rotolidge. It was on Amazon for 35 bucks. I got this for less than five dollars, I think so
48560	50560	that is fantastic. I
50920	57160	highly highly recommend secondhand book shopping. It's not really something I've done a lot given that some of the books that I do buy
57480	59400	to be rather
59400	61400	what's it would not not as popular
61840	64760	as some like let's say a Jane Austen or a Charles Dickens.
65640	70960	So it's kind of hard to find exactly what I want outside of buying it from from Amazon or some
71400	73400	large bookseller.
73520	80640	But man, what I really do enjoy about secondhand book shopping is that kind of like spontaneity where you just pick up great books by
81200	86080	authors that you've been reading for a while and then you get it for like two bucks. It's fantastic.
86800	89200	Okay, let's start off. The first book is I've already
89800	93960	started this book as you can see from the bookmark. You actually can't see that. There you go.
94480	98000	It's Alan Kazupanchek's What Is Sex?
98520	103800	Man, I've only read like what 10 pages so far because I'm trying really quite slowly and really
104480	105440	really
105440	108560	led the idea to settle in me because
109240	111080	you know
111080	115640	sexuality, sex, these words are very loaded terms, but they're kind of the philosophical
116080	119720	and even ontological approach Alan Kazupanchek is taking in this book.
120240	128240	It's it's at least for me being a neo-fight. It seems rather unorthodox and I'm trying to like let the ideas really settle
128560	130240	and
130240	133240	kind of battle with them in some sense and
134320	139560	in fact, I'll be doing a book review on this for sure because I think it's a topic worth discussing
140720	142720	particularly given the current political climate.
143720	149880	The next book is now, you know, okay, I'll take both books out. In fact, Todd McGovern, his
150200	155680	Emancipation After Hegel and his other book Capitalism and Desire. This book, I've read parts of it,
155880	162120	but I want to get through the whole thing. This one, I haven't and man, I am excited for this because
162280	169440	so for instance, here's a review that Slavoj Zizek wrote on this book Emancipation After Hegel. Here's what he said.
170360	179520	This is the book we were waiting for after long years of being bombarded by Hegel as a clotted liberal whose last word is recognition.
180400	182400	With Todd McGovern,
182400	184400	the revolutionary Hegel is back.
184680	189200	However, it is not the old Marxist Hegel, but the Hegel After Marx.
189680	195200	The Hegel who makes us aware that revolution is an open and risk process
195920	199200	which necessarily entails catastrophic failures.
200080	206520	Hegel's problem, how to save the legacy of the French Revolution after its breakdown is our problem today.
206880	209920	How to save the project of radical emancipation
210400	214640	after the catastrophe of starvinism in a truly democratic country.
215480	223920	Emancipation After Hegel would be reprinted in hundreds of thousands of copies and distributed for free to all students.
224400	227480	Read this book or ignore it at your own risk.
227480	232920	I really like the last sentence because generally Zizek isn't a very kind of prescriptive thinker.
232920	237160	He never tells you what to do. He's more like a he's a critique and an analyst and
237680	242800	the fact that he said read this book or ignore it at your own risk, it gives very
243360	245360	Jordan Peterson vibes, in fact.
245680	248800	But now I certainly am going to get to this soon. In fact, I think after
249520	252360	too much to read, but I think after what is sex,
253320	257880	I'm going to read the emancipation after Hegel, not really even for the political aspects of it, but
258600	260440	man, I've been so
260440	264280	just obsessed with this idea of contradiction the past couple of months.
264280	266280	It's been taking up all of my thinking
266920	273960	to probably an unhealthy level because I'm trying to analyze everything via that lens of Hegelian contradiction.
274520	277000	Okay, so yeah, that's that book and then of course
277560	279400	capitalism and desire.
279480	284520	One of my, I'd say one of my personal goals in life, kind of like a dream is to get
286120	289400	Tom McGovern on my podcast and discuss this book
290120	291720	and particularly
291720	293720	let him elucidate as to why
294200	297160	Marxists really need to take psychoanalysis seriously.
298280	301960	So I'm gonna, yeah, try and work towards that and aspire towards that, but I think
302520	308600	I haven't even reached out to him yet, but before I do reach out, I think I need to attune myself more with this work and give it a bit more time
308920	310920	before having a conversation with him.
311720	315400	And the next book is Adrian Johnston's Džek's Ontology.
316040	319080	This is also something, obviously, given that I'm a huge Džek here.
319160	324600	I would certainly want to read soon, although I think this book is gonna wait till the end of the year
324680	327720	because I want to get through some of Tom McGovern's and Zupanček's work.
328920	332280	And you know, given that Džek is this huge figure,
332920	334920	Goliath of a figure in the
335880	340040	Slovenian school of, Slovenian philosophers, you know, Džek,
340840	344440	Zupanček, and in fact, I shouldn't even say that I should say
345160	351240	more of the kind of the, these new Hegelians, the way people like McGovern or Adrian Johnston
351880	353880	or of course Džek.
354680	359960	Džek is such a daunting, towering figure that we tend to focus only on his work.
360520	363320	So I want to try and focus a bit more on the other thinkers.
363800	370360	Zupanček, McGovern, Johnston, before, not long before, why I'm also paying attention to Džek's work.
370680	374920	It's also the fact that Džek is a prolific writer, so he just writes so much.
376200	381240	Okay, I think I went through all of that. Yes. So now let's get to my other book pile.
381640	384440	All of these were not really planned purchases. It's the best part of
385480	388920	you know, going secondhand book shopping, you just pick up whatever's there.
389640	394920	Yep, The Prophet by Khaled Gibran, my friend who I went with, she told me,
395000	397080	she in fact read this book and she told me she hated it.
397640	402920	But I do know some people really, really enjoy this book and it's kind of a very popular book.
403480	407000	So I probably won't read it this year. Let's be honest, I'm reading some other stuff, but
407000	414760	it's just always good to have in the collection. Ah, Jen Austen's Persuasions. I watched the film on Netflix.
415160	421160	Wasn't impressed, wasn't impressed, because to be honest, I did quite like Pride and Prejudice.
421160	425240	I thought it was quite good. But Persuasions, it wasn't all that good.
427160	434680	The next book is Charles Dickens Great Expectations. This is, yeah, I want to get to this.
435640	442520	Dickens, man, I think it's kind of hard because I really do want to spend at least six months
442520	446920	getting through most of Charles Dickens's work, particularly because I think,
447720	451320	even though I've only read Hard Times and what's the other one?
454360	458440	I've read one other Dickens book. Doesn't matter. Hard Times for sure, but there's one on the book
458440	465800	I've read. I feel like a lot of his thinking, I mean, obviously he's a literary figure, but
466760	473800	at a philosophical level, at a sociological level, what he tries to delineate in his books
473800	480040	is kind of what I try to theorize on in society and make sense of. So I gotta take him more seriously.
481080	487000	And then another Jen Austen book, Sense and Sensibility. Honestly, I don't even know
487000	490600	Jen Austen wrote a book called Sense and Sensibility. Yeah, I only picked it up when I saw
491400	497800	her name and I really liked Jen Austen. So, oh, Charlotte Bronte's Jen Air. So
498920	503800	is that how it's pronounced? Jen Air? Okay, this is really interesting. My friend, Tess, who,
503800	509720	I don't think she minds me mentioning her name. She's been reading this book right now and she
509720	516120	recently, I haven't, obviously, I love, love, love Wuthering Heights. So Charlotte Bronte's sister,
516120	522360	Emily Bronte's book, her magnum opus, let's say. And therefore, I really want to get to
522360	527720	Jen Air, too, or the Bronte sisters. I think that they're brilliant. So from this book,
527720	533160	she shared this quote with me and I thought it was excellent. It's exactly why I like the Bronte's,
533160	540760	because they're so, man, I like how crude and in some sense, so violent their writing is.
540920	548200	It just, it's so, it's such good writing. So here's a line by, I think it's Jane saying this and
548200	555480	she says, so Tess shared this with me. She says, I am not an angel. I asserted and I will not be one
555480	563880	till I die. I will be myself, Mr. Rochester. You must neither expect nor exact anything
563880	567720	so let's seal off me. Let me actually change the screen so you could read it too if
570520	576120	so let's seal off me for you will not get it any more than I shall get it of you. So this is a
576120	580760	small excerpt from Jen Air and I kind of tweeted it and I thought that was so good. I thought it was
580760	585960	so good and I even commented the divine feminists cringe. It's yet another patriarchal idea that
585960	592680	harms women. I totally agree. I am not a fan of any of this idealization of women as abstract figures.
592680	598440	In fact, that's why I like, I think, even Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights because it just shows,
599000	605080	well, love it, it's violence, but also the characters, they're such complex characters and
605080	612440	it shows a dark side of both Heathcliff and is it Elizabeth? My god, I forgot. Yeah, and Elizabeth,
612440	618920	it shows both the beauty and the ugly of these characters, which for me is what great literature
618920	624680	does. And last but not least is this book here, The Sociology Key Concepts. I'll probably never
624680	631080	read it. It's just more like a reference book that I'll probably use it as. And yeah, that's kind
631080	637640	of it. Those are the books for this book haul. In terms of quantity, a bit more books than
637720	646120	per usual. The recent being is because of, again, my great little second hand book shopping
648440	654200	thing I did with my friends, which I'm really happy about. Alrighty, thanks for watching. I hope
654200	660760	I, as per usual, gave you a few ideas, put a few books or authors in your mind, in your head
660760	666120	that they'll hopefully be an impetus for you to go read these authors. But just if you're
666120	671960	into philosophy like me, I would highly, highly recommend looking into the work of Todd McGovern.
671960	678040	He is fantastic. And he also has a podcast. Let me pull that out too, in fact, while they're added.
679640	687880	It's on Spotify. It's called Why Theory. It is really, really good, this podcast here.
687880	693160	Why Theory goes through so many concepts and I've kind of been binge listening. I was going to say
693160	698600	binge watching, but it's actually binge listening, this podcast. Sorry for the abrupt ending there.
698600	705080	I clicked stop recording on OBS by mistake. Now, the proper ending. Thanks for watching. I'll see
705080	711640	you in the next book haul video or the next video, which probably is going to be a little, little
711640	717960	vlog slash analysis on Character Guard from this book, either or perhaps it's Magnum Opus
717960	725240	on Bodom, which is going to be an interesting topic to discuss. Alrighty, see you in the next one. Cheers.
