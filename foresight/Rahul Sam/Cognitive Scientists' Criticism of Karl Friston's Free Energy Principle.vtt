00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
I completely got your critiques of predictive processing, which I concur with, but what are

00:06.000 --> 00:11.760
your views on something like the free energy principle by Carl Friston, who, after all,

00:11.760 --> 00:16.800
is a neuroscientist. Would you say it's a good model of framework to work with?

00:18.160 --> 00:25.440
No, I think it's a bogus analogy. It's obviously an analogy because the term comes from physics.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.920
In free energy, there's a perfectly well-understood idea where energy is the

00:29.920 --> 00:33.920
capacity to work, and free energy is the energy that's available in the current

00:33.920 --> 00:39.200
contest to do work. Great idea, really important. So what's the free energy principle? Well,

00:39.840 --> 00:44.240
people who are big fans of predictive processing have worked their butts off to try to figure out

00:44.240 --> 00:49.120
what it is. And Friston's a horrible writer. He writes with incredible obscurity. He writes

00:49.120 --> 00:52.880
like a postmodernist, actually, kind of postmodernist mathematician. And that's not what

00:52.960 --> 00:57.840
mathematics is supposed to be like. Mathematics is incredibly powerful because it's clear,

00:57.840 --> 01:03.120
and you can see what's going on. But his math is unclear, and the free energy principle

01:03.760 --> 01:07.840
is what I call a bogus analogy. The term comes from my book, Balance. I wrote a book on balance

01:07.840 --> 01:12.880
a couple of years ago, and it talks both about the neuroscience of balance, but it also talks

01:12.880 --> 01:18.960
about the way balance has become a metaphor that pervades human thought. But different

01:18.960 --> 01:22.800
metaphors have different values. Metaphors aren't all good. Some of them are really evil.

01:22.800 --> 01:29.280
They can be used to defend slavery, for example. So your question is, what kind of metaphor have

01:29.280 --> 01:36.960
we got here? Is it one that's good or unclear or utterly bogus? Well, here, I think it's bogus

01:36.960 --> 01:42.160
because he's trying to carry over from physics some sense of profundity from free energy.

01:42.160 --> 01:46.160
But if you look what he means by that, as much or far as anyone's been able to figure it out,

01:46.160 --> 01:50.080
and people like Anil Seth have tried to figure out what he meant by it, you say, well, it's just

01:50.080 --> 01:54.480
another way of saying predictive processing. So I'm trying to say that what the brain is doing

01:54.480 --> 02:00.640
is to make predictions about the future in order to figure out what's likely to happen and satisfy

02:00.640 --> 02:07.280
its goals. So that's not a reasonable idea. It's a real hypothesis, and I think it's one of the

02:07.280 --> 02:15.200
six things that brains do. But to elevate that into a free energy principle using a bogus physical

02:16.000 --> 02:22.320
expression for physics, as I think is frankly illegitimate. It's not a good use of metaphor.

02:22.320 --> 02:28.720
It's not a good use of analogy. It's a highly misleading term that is pseudo profundity.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.280
It's kind of like, actually, among the post-modernists you mentioned, I don't think

02:35.280 --> 02:41.280
Foucault is bogus. I think he's actually got a lot of insights into the way society works. But a lot

02:41.360 --> 02:47.200
of the other people in that category, Derrida and often Cizek, they really just don't understand

02:47.200 --> 02:54.080
the difference between obscurity and profundity. So that is, you should be able to figure out,

02:54.080 --> 02:59.280
what are they saying? Is it true or is it false? And you can do that often with Foucault. You can

02:59.280 --> 03:04.400
do that with good cognitive scientists. But the idea of free energy is just so kind of obscure

03:04.400 --> 03:09.360
that it's hard to make sense of it. And I think actually the predictive processing idea is clear

03:09.360 --> 03:14.480
enough that you can see that it's not true. Because as I said, the mind does a lot of other

03:14.480 --> 03:19.520
things besides prediction. And it does it by means other than Bayesian processing. So predictive

03:19.520 --> 03:24.880
processing is an idea that's interesting but wrong. Whereas free energy is an idea that's just

03:24.880 --> 03:33.200
too obscure to be even wrong. I see, because as a layperson, my confusion always with the free

03:33.200 --> 03:37.760
energy principle was I saw what Professor Friston was getting. And in fact, I'm currently reading

03:37.760 --> 03:43.920
his book Active Inference. But as a meta theory, as like a theory of mind that encompasses what

03:43.920 --> 03:49.840
the mind is, I always felt it lacked certain other parts of what the mind does. Like for instance,

03:49.840 --> 03:56.640
coherence, explanatory coherence. And emotion for evaluation. And appraisal and communication

03:56.640 --> 04:00.800
with others. You need all of these things. If you're going to have a full theory of mind,

04:00.800 --> 04:07.440
it's really just got one tiny corner. It commits something that I've called Thaley's disease.

04:08.240 --> 04:12.240
Thaley's was really the first philosopher and the first scientist. Absolutely brilliant thinker.

04:12.240 --> 04:16.560
But he came up with a theory that was just a little too simple. His theory is everything is

04:16.560 --> 04:23.280
water. Well, that was brilliant. It's absolutely simple. But even by Aristotelian standards,

04:23.280 --> 04:27.520
whether you also need earth, air, and fire, it just didn't cut it. And of course, now that we

04:27.520 --> 04:33.360
know there's 118 different elements. No, it doesn't work. So what I call Thaley's disease is coming

04:33.360 --> 04:38.080
up with a theory that looks brilliantly simple, but it's just way too simple. And that's definitely

04:38.080 --> 04:40.080
true of predictive processing as well.
