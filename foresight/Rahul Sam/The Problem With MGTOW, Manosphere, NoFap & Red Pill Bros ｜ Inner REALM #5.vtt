WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
everyone welcome to yet another episode of the inner realm podcast before we

00:04.840 --> 00:10.960
start off some housekeeping points I apologize if I'm a bit sniffly and I

00:10.960 --> 00:15.000
cough and I do all those things with my throat you know like scratch my throat

00:15.000 --> 00:20.320
and all that unfortunately I've got a cold I just hope that I won't be too

00:20.320 --> 00:24.960
irritable for you the listener and if it is too bad I'll edit the whole thing

00:24.960 --> 00:29.760
out and make it a bit more palatable the second thing is I've got to admit I've

00:29.760 --> 00:36.160
tried recording this episode four times already yeah I've spent four different

00:36.160 --> 00:40.520
sessions on trying to get this episode right and I don't know why but I

00:40.520 --> 00:45.160
simply seem to not be happy with it I simply seem to not be able to convey

00:45.160 --> 00:50.000
the points that I'm trying to convey I think partially is because even when I

00:50.000 --> 00:54.240
was writing the script for this episode I was a bit hesitant because you know

00:54.240 --> 01:01.560
red pill, nanosphere, MGTO doubly, NOFAP, whatever these movements or

01:01.560 --> 01:08.320
subcultures are they tend to be rather controversial and very very political

01:08.320 --> 01:14.320
by nature and as a result of that of course I I'm not a fan of this kind of

01:14.320 --> 01:19.760
casual dismissiveness of you know corporate media and anyone that does

01:19.760 --> 01:25.400
talk about these communities critically I think they've been so maligned and

01:25.400 --> 01:31.320
miscarriage that anyone who tries to even be a bit critical of these

01:31.320 --> 01:37.880
communities end up getting out of slack or end up you know being called a

01:37.880 --> 01:43.000
fraud or a liar or something like that simply because I feel like people that

01:43.000 --> 01:46.640
are part of these communities who benefited a lot including myself by the

01:46.640 --> 01:52.040
way have become very defensive of what these communities are so when I was

01:52.040 --> 01:55.600
trying to record the episode every single time I felt like I said something

01:55.600 --> 01:59.240
that I shouldn't have said I felt like I'm a spoke or I said something that was

01:59.240 --> 02:04.120
untrue so I just you know adequately I didn't feel like I could publish that

02:04.120 --> 02:09.480
episode so I kept trying again and again hey look let's hope I get it right this

02:09.480 --> 02:14.680
time in any case before I start off because of the as I said the nature of

02:14.680 --> 02:19.240
the podcast I do want to make oh I want to do want to stipulate the whole

02:19.240 --> 02:26.040
episode with some caveats it's not only because of the point I made before but

02:26.040 --> 02:30.440
also because this is probably the first podcast where I'm actually being critical

02:30.440 --> 02:35.280
of a certain ideology and certain cultural movement I generally don't

02:35.280 --> 02:39.040
tend to do that but this is the first time I'm actually I think breaking down

02:39.040 --> 02:42.760
my qualms with a certain movement and my disagreements with a certain ideology

02:43.120 --> 02:48.240
and fleshing it out on a podcast therefore I would say things that will

02:48.240 --> 02:52.680
contradict my claims especially my critique of ideology ironically I think

02:52.680 --> 02:59.480
I'm gonna critique ideology using ideology so if so facto at times I will be

02:59.480 --> 03:07.760
an utter hypocrite I will also say adding on to that point I haven't given any of

03:07.760 --> 03:12.360
these communities the time and research effort they deserve so I really do

03:12.360 --> 03:17.120
apologize if I'm being casually cynical or dismissive of the ideologies I mean

03:17.120 --> 03:21.240
it does take a lot of words to truly understand the essence of what these

03:21.240 --> 03:27.480
cultural movements and subcultures are and in no way would I like my my intent

03:27.480 --> 03:32.760
at least and and that's why I said I recorded this podcast five times already

03:32.760 --> 03:37.800
for four times already this is the fifth time because I just didn't want to

03:37.800 --> 03:44.080
misrepresent these movements the way the corporate media does so I hope at

03:44.080 --> 03:49.640
least my intent in making this recording this episode comes across and I'll

03:49.640 --> 03:54.120
definitely put in the intellectual and even experiential labor to try and

03:54.120 --> 03:57.560
understand these groups and the individuals within these groups deeply

03:57.560 --> 04:03.800
as a matter of fact I'm reading Rolo Rolo Tomasi's book The Rational Male now

04:03.800 --> 04:08.400
you know according to his own Amazon page I think he calls let me actually

04:08.400 --> 04:14.480
look it up according to his own Amazon page he calls himself the godfather of

04:14.480 --> 04:20.040
the red pill and I feel like he's very influential amongst his red pill aiding

04:20.040 --> 04:26.240
managed fair community helping men find women and get into relationships and all

04:26.240 --> 04:31.960
that and look even his book there are some some good advice I think there were

04:31.960 --> 04:37.640
some things that are it can be applicable to you know our lives and I also

04:37.640 --> 04:44.040
wanted to sort of understand the broader view of how he views sexual dynamics and

04:44.040 --> 04:49.400
relationships between men and women which is why I said that I'm much not

04:49.400 --> 04:53.960
gonna just watch a few episodes on YouTube or watch a few go through a few

04:54.000 --> 04:58.760
ready threads I'm actually gonna try and you know read the books that come

04:58.760 --> 05:05.000
out of these communities because I feel like writing is the most pulled out most

05:05.000 --> 05:10.800
precise and well detailed ports for you truly want to know a person well first

05:10.800 --> 05:16.000
look at what they do but also read what they write over what they say because

05:16.040 --> 05:24.640
what they write in some sense is more pulled out fleshed out ideas and it's

05:24.640 --> 05:28.160
because of that I would say because of all these points I made that this will

05:28.160 --> 05:33.120
definitely be my first episode on this topic of many to come because these

05:33.120 --> 05:39.240
subcultures I hate it when you know corporate media maligns them saying

05:39.240 --> 05:42.480
that there's some French far-right group or some silly thing like that because

05:42.480 --> 05:45.960
they actually are quite influential I personally know a lot of people that

05:45.960 --> 05:51.000
are that I've got great benefit from these communities and that would be

05:51.000 --> 05:58.200
including myself which is why I firstly want to make a case in defense of

05:58.200 --> 06:03.720
bro culture now we've got a delineate bro culture from the red pill communities

06:03.720 --> 06:09.040
on the internet I think bro culture is a bit more broader whereas red pill is a

06:09.040 --> 06:15.880
lot more political oh by the way I just want to add a point since obviously MGTO

06:15.880 --> 06:22.000
W manasphere no fap it's all a mouthful as a umbrella term I'll just use the word

06:22.000 --> 06:29.320
red pill community but I do think this whole bro culture and this idea of you

06:29.320 --> 06:36.040
know masculinity what would it call it hyper masculinity maybe just connect a

06:36.040 --> 06:43.440
lot with the red pill community it goes hand-in-hand in many ways I gotta say

06:43.440 --> 06:50.840
as a young man when I was maybe 17 18 or probably even a bit younger and then

06:50.840 --> 06:57.480
even into my early 20s like 1920 maybe even 21 bro culture was extremely

06:57.480 --> 07:02.520
beneficial for me as a young person and the best to define what bro culture is

07:02.520 --> 07:09.960
is through my anecdotal experience so bro culture is greatly connected to

07:10.000 --> 07:16.760
sports and and yeah like the red hole the red hole red pill thing it's

07:16.760 --> 07:21.840
interesting right because a lot of people that generally tend to be a part of

07:21.840 --> 07:27.960
really embrace that bro doctor in the bro culture they probably would consider

07:27.960 --> 07:35.480
themselves to be red-pilled or whatever and a good way to define bro culture is

07:35.880 --> 07:41.880
actually by a speech by the Roosevelt the eponymous speech called the

07:41.880 --> 07:46.160
strenuous life and I think it captures what bro culture is best in a more

07:46.160 --> 07:52.520
refined gentlemanly manner and I quote a small part from the speech it says I

07:52.520 --> 07:58.560
wish to preach not the doctrine of ignoble ease but the doctrine of the

07:58.560 --> 08:05.080
strenuous life the life of toil and effort of labor and strike to preach that

08:05.080 --> 08:11.120
highest form of success which comes not to the man who desires mere easy peace

08:11.120 --> 08:16.240
but to the man who does not shrink from danger from hardship or from bitter

08:16.240 --> 08:23.520
toil and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph so yes as I

08:23.520 --> 08:28.120
said this is kind of the message of bro culture it's the whole pull yourself up

08:28.120 --> 08:33.520
by your bootstraps message and as I I'm probably repeating myself now it's

08:33.560 --> 08:37.800
deeply associated with sports it's this embrace of masculinity the good and the

08:37.800 --> 08:42.080
bad keep in mind and it gives the message of self-reliance to nasty

08:42.080 --> 08:46.920
discipline and I feel especially for young boys and young men this is a great

08:46.920 --> 08:52.840
message you know leaving aside politics the whole you know picking up women

08:52.840 --> 08:58.720
thing and the whole all the critiques that I come to their role I still

08:58.720 --> 09:04.720
believe essentially these are good messages you know they they not just

09:04.720 --> 09:08.560
for men but even for women telling someone to take responsibility for their

09:08.560 --> 09:14.680
life it's something that we don't hear much in contemporary culture and I

09:14.680 --> 09:19.440
would also say you know on the on the topic of strength and sort of self

09:19.440 --> 09:25.240
improvement let's say a good good example is Elliot Hulse now undoubtedly

09:25.240 --> 09:32.920
Elliot Hulse is a full-on bro he's like the quintessential bro and is also very

09:32.920 --> 09:36.200
much in the whole redfoot community he's going through his own face he had the

09:36.200 --> 09:41.240
whole mega thing now I used to watch a lot of Elliot Hulse's videos because I

09:41.240 --> 09:46.560
was rather I would say enamored by strength I still am I I admire strength

09:46.560 --> 09:50.840
and you know I really like strongman and I used to watch some some of his some

09:50.840 --> 09:56.760
of his videos to you know to do strongman workouts and all that before I

09:56.760 --> 10:03.600
stopped because suddenly I felt like he became this very zealous

10:03.600 --> 10:09.080
Tradcon traditional conservative and you know he was like all he talks about is

10:09.080 --> 10:13.680
like how women should submit to men and and he really kind of embodied that

10:13.680 --> 10:20.040
whole traditional conservative I don't even know the Tradcon ethos into

10:20.040 --> 10:25.280
himself and then it frankly it became as much I still like him I still think he

10:25.280 --> 10:29.240
gives good advice like for example I'm gonna pick up a small clip from his

10:29.240 --> 10:35.040
podcast here to you know exemplify what I mean but he's became this like a

10:35.040 --> 10:40.120
knowing ideal of that constantly preached Tradcon values and and constantly

10:40.120 --> 10:44.960
evangelized his way of living and prescribed his way of living onto the

10:44.960 --> 10:52.560
world and I guess onto his videos in this case but despite all of that this is

10:52.560 --> 10:59.480
an example of why I think this whole bro culture movement and the let's say the

10:59.480 --> 11:04.000
what's the word not poorly is but the more influential people in this

11:04.000 --> 11:08.920
movement do give a good message so this one's on the whole no fat movement and

11:08.920 --> 11:15.440
which is also connected to all of this look I think the young people especially

11:15.440 --> 11:20.280
young men have a massive problem with photography I've dealt with it I would

11:20.280 --> 11:25.840
call it a behavioral addiction I think a lot of people are either ashamed to talk

11:25.840 --> 11:30.240
about it or they trivialize it but as far as I'm concerned I know a lot of my

11:30.240 --> 11:36.960
mates who sometimes ah it's like they if that isn't an addiction I don't know

11:36.960 --> 11:41.280
what it is you know like they'll go hours sometimes you know indulging

11:41.280 --> 11:45.480
themselves in porn consuming porn so it definitely is a problem it's definitely

11:45.480 --> 11:49.080
something that has to be spoken of and for the longest time the only people

11:49.080 --> 11:53.080
that spoke about porn addiction and this problem with internet pornography

11:53.080 --> 11:59.440
were the red pill grows all the people in this you know no fat movement which

11:59.440 --> 12:03.200
is connected to the bro culture they were the only people that actually spoke

12:03.240 --> 12:13.080
about how this is probably a dangerous thing that it's probably affecting young

12:13.080 --> 12:18.400
people in their cases focus more on men you know psychologically spiritually

12:18.400 --> 12:25.280
but I found this particular video by Elliot to be a rather astute take because

12:25.280 --> 12:30.880
he doesn't just say don't watch porn don't jerk off or he doesn't just say you

12:30.880 --> 12:34.640
know don't don't be a loser that just sits sitting on jocks in front of a

12:34.640 --> 12:38.560
computer all day and you know jerks off for women on the internet just jerks

12:38.560 --> 12:41.800
off to women on the internet he actually makes a very very interesting

12:41.800 --> 12:46.200
point and this is a bit bit of a longer video but I think what he's trying to say

12:46.200 --> 12:52.040
is a good example of the kind of messages one could hear from the bro

12:52.040 --> 12:57.080
culture movement and then how that could be greatly beneficial for young people

12:57.360 --> 13:05.120
mostly for young people but for anyone really I've heard you yo Elliot I've

13:05.120 --> 13:11.000
heard you say that men in their 20s should bust their nut once a week why

13:11.000 --> 13:16.480
is this I think I'd like to retain for as much longer than one week thank you

13:16.480 --> 13:23.240
I'm loving this program so first of all I have my conviction about it that comes

13:23.480 --> 13:27.880
from what I've studied right again this is I'm not an expert in this but I've

13:27.880 --> 13:30.600
often referred to this great little book called listen to your body and it's

13:30.600 --> 13:33.840
based on traditional Chinese medicine and I do think that there's some value I

13:33.840 --> 13:38.360
think there's tremendous value to Chinese medicine and natural health right

13:38.360 --> 13:42.280
essentially it's natural health how to be healthy naturally without you know big

13:42.280 --> 13:48.960
pharma and so there are ways to live that that improve longevity and vitality

13:49.000 --> 13:53.960
and make you feel good right make you make you the best you and so according to

13:53.960 --> 13:58.480
traditional Chinese medicine in this nice little cute little book he goes on

13:58.480 --> 14:01.080
and says that there are clear guidelines and traditional Chinese medicine

14:01.080 --> 14:07.400
about ejaculation of sperm so the the premise is that the more you blow your

14:07.400 --> 14:12.720
load the more you're you're losing your vitality right and I think we've all

14:12.720 --> 14:16.880
sort of experienced that right I know I've had right it took me until my 40s

14:16.880 --> 14:21.000
I didn't realize it when I was younger a lot of you guys recognize it more for

14:21.000 --> 14:25.160
whatever reason but not until my 40s I started to recognize it boy the day after

14:25.160 --> 14:31.640
I blow my load and for like you know a day or two a little off and then I also

14:31.640 --> 14:35.760
discovered takes me about 10 days personally at this point for me to feel

14:35.760 --> 14:40.200
that vigor that fire that I've had before blowing my load and now it makes it

14:40.200 --> 14:45.840
makes sense to me now after reading this pseudo scientific right I don't think

14:45.840 --> 14:48.480
there's anything wrong with pseudoscience right in fact like the whole

14:48.480 --> 14:52.560
vaccine thing is pseudoscience it's like not exactly science but they're

14:52.560 --> 14:59.040
pointing at something there see what I mean for some reason

14:59.040 --> 15:05.360
unfortunately because they get sucked into ideology suddenly everyone who's a

15:05.360 --> 15:11.040
part of the Red Bull movement also have to be you know I would say I'm fairly

15:11.080 --> 15:15.760
critical of vaccines and the whole movement or what whole whole thing that

15:15.760 --> 15:24.640
happened during COVID in any case out of the video so anyway it says clear

15:24.640 --> 15:29.640
guidelines about ejaculation of sperm in general not more than twice a month is

15:29.640 --> 15:33.800
advised because of loss of vitality other consideration includes the men's

15:33.800 --> 15:39.000
health and his age the ancient texts give the following advice for a man of 20

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
years old once in every four days just going based on that right at 30 once

15:45.000 --> 15:52.200
every eight days at 40 once every 16 days at 50 once every 20 days and at 60

15:52.200 --> 15:59.280
once a month so I come to the conclusion now this validates what was my

15:59.280 --> 16:02.000
conclusion or they kind of work together I don't know if I had this thought

16:02.000 --> 16:04.960
and then read it in the book or read the book and it helped me have thought but

16:05.000 --> 16:12.960
I've sort of sort of brought this together in my own mind that's or based on my

16:12.960 --> 16:17.680
experience as well this is I think this is a pretty solid guideline it doesn't

16:17.680 --> 16:21.720
mean that it's written in stone but one of the things that I've discovered just

16:21.720 --> 16:26.560
through my own experience but watching you guys and watching videos and

16:26.560 --> 16:31.280
noticing this whole no fat we seem in retention movement there are a few things

16:31.360 --> 16:36.400
that could be pathological about it and one of them is that it becomes starts to

16:36.400 --> 16:41.320
become a God it starts to become an obsession what I mean by that right in

16:41.320 --> 16:44.280
the same way that masturbation becomes an obsession right because he's

16:44.280 --> 16:48.640
engaging in that ritual and you're worshiping porn every day when you do

16:48.640 --> 16:54.480
this there is a sense of pride I started to notice it when I was fasting right I

16:54.480 --> 16:58.120
fasted before doing see you see me retention I fasted you know started

16:58.120 --> 17:03.720
fasting back in 2018 I only started doing see more attention this year and so

17:03.720 --> 17:07.960
I'm careful with myself because I saw what happened to me with fasting I started

17:07.960 --> 17:14.360
to get proud I started to personally identify with my streaks you catch where

17:14.360 --> 17:19.000
I'm going with this I started to make it a bigger deal than what it was and the

17:19.000 --> 17:25.240
month the monks the the month the monastery the guys in the monasteries

17:25.240 --> 17:30.200
right I think I remember reading this from Briana Shav also he talks about how

17:30.200 --> 17:38.120
not to be too austere with yourself for fear of pride he says that Satan loves

17:38.120 --> 17:43.360
it when you're really tough on yourself because then you start to become you know

17:43.360 --> 17:51.800
hmm well I did no fat for 20 days I did 30 days I did 50 days all right so then

17:51.800 --> 17:55.260
it starts to become a religion it starts to become an obsession it starts to

17:55.260 --> 18:00.640
become an idol that's barely what it ends up becoming right or I fasted wow this

18:00.640 --> 18:05.360
guy fasted for 10 days why he fasted for 20 days well I only fasted for five

18:05.360 --> 18:11.240
days I gotta live up to these guys it starts to become an ego issue and I

18:11.240 --> 18:17.320
don't and I wouldn't have been able to warn against this as it relates to see

18:17.360 --> 18:22.280
intention had I not messed up during my first season of fasting now I don't take

18:22.280 --> 18:27.400
myself too seriously with any of this stuff in other words I don't make it an

18:27.400 --> 18:31.840
idol I don't have I'm not personally identified with it I don't get my sense

18:31.840 --> 18:37.160
of value and self-worth from it so that's just that's one warning right that's

18:37.160 --> 18:40.840
more of a that's more of a spiritual warning it's a warning against pride

18:40.840 --> 18:46.080
that's all it is right start to feel like well look what I did and even that

18:46.120 --> 18:54.600
just just just the whole idea that I am going to fast is sort of an idol it's

18:54.600 --> 19:02.280
sort of a egotistical way of looking at it when the saints and the divines and

19:02.280 --> 19:06.800
the mystics right I love the orthodox tradition they even call some of their

19:06.800 --> 19:18.880
guys mystics they they they recognize that it is it's a it's a spiritual battle

19:18.880 --> 19:23.840
that you're you're gearing up for it's not a matter of challenging your yourself

19:23.840 --> 19:30.840
right it's and when it's a spiritual battle it's beyond your will and so I

19:30.840 --> 19:34.760
can will myself to get something done and then I can be proud about it because

19:34.800 --> 19:42.840
look at me or if it's a spiritual fast it's a spiritual retention or abstinence

19:42.840 --> 19:53.000
right it's God is helping me God has given me grace to do this this is a

19:53.000 --> 19:59.320
humble way of looking at life that saves us from pride but also saves us from

19:59.320 --> 20:03.520
depression because if you start to think that it's up to me to get things done and

20:03.520 --> 20:09.800
they don't get done you're gonna feel bad about yourself so both either way if we

20:09.800 --> 20:14.760
if our if our will wins or loses we lose if your will wins you will you lose

20:14.760 --> 20:21.600
because you become proud if your will loses you lose because you take that

20:21.600 --> 20:24.800
personally as well it's like the opposite of pride but it's on the same

20:24.800 --> 20:29.480
spectrum I don't even know what to call it right but like depression right

20:29.480 --> 20:34.320
depression is is on the same spectrum of pride I don't that's the right word but

20:34.320 --> 20:40.840
feeling sorry and sad about yourself is just as it's almost it's a it's a other

20:40.840 --> 20:46.200
side of the same coin of feeling proud and good about yourself because they're

20:46.200 --> 20:53.720
both wrapped up in what I can do what I didn't do as opposed to resting in the

20:53.720 --> 21:00.920
Lord and saying and asking God to give me the grace I think that perspective is

21:00.920 --> 21:10.200
good for us right again once again I don't know I know that there's spiritual

21:10.200 --> 21:14.360
wisdom in the literature and the Bible and stuff like this right I know that

21:14.360 --> 21:20.480
there are good ideas that were propounded by ascetics and such and then

21:21.240 --> 21:27.520
then there are commandments things to do and not to do but in my life I've looked

21:27.520 --> 21:31.640
at those things and I recognize them as maybe external like okay I get that I

21:31.640 --> 21:36.280
see that I understand that but it's not until and maybe we gotta all make our

21:36.280 --> 21:42.240
own mistakes is not until I've seen it in myself and others that I'm like oh this

21:42.240 --> 21:47.800
is practical advice it's not just religious weird stuff right so you know

21:47.840 --> 21:52.120
people are like oh that's all archaic religious thinking well it's actually

21:52.120 --> 21:58.760
very practical right so it's very practical to lean on God lean on the

21:58.760 --> 22:02.560
Creator lean on the Father lean on nature whatever you want to call it even

22:02.560 --> 22:08.680
though nature is a fruit of God I want to be in walking with the Creator rather

22:08.680 --> 22:14.040
than offering it up or recognizing that I am not 100% sovereign over my life but

22:14.040 --> 22:22.920
the grace and mercy of God precedes me then you can't get depressed you can't

22:22.920 --> 22:26.400
get depressed you can't get depressed because your life is in the hands of

22:26.400 --> 22:30.600
the Lord and if he sees it fit for you to have this failure then it's up to you

22:30.600 --> 22:37.480
to be grateful for and see the lining in the cloud the silver lining of the

22:37.480 --> 22:42.960
cloud right every every every bad thing that happens to us it's because God is

22:42.960 --> 22:47.720
allowing it to happen to us because we're supposed to make something of it

22:47.720 --> 22:51.080
but if you think that you're in charge and something bad happens you start

22:51.080 --> 22:55.000
going okay what did I do how do I fix this why why why me I screwed up I'm such

22:55.000 --> 23:00.580
a bad person and the same thing on the other side right it's the same coin same

23:00.580 --> 23:05.760
coin oh look what I did proud of me look at this I did it and you didn't

23:06.040 --> 23:12.120
right it's the same shit same shit you gotta stop you gotta stop and so as just

23:12.120 --> 23:16.440
a warning against that right I'm not saying that's gonna happen to you but

23:16.440 --> 23:23.520
just as a warning I advise not to push ourselves that hard I know that doesn't

23:23.520 --> 23:27.400
I know that sounds like a contradiction from you know promasculine Elliot that's

23:27.400 --> 23:33.160
telling everybody to do hard stuff but having austerity having discipline being

23:33.160 --> 23:37.360
committed to something is very different than being attached to something

23:37.360 --> 23:42.520
making something an idol and and and being personally identified with it very

23:42.520 --> 23:48.120
different things try your best in everything that you do but leave room

23:48.120 --> 23:57.160
for God that's all it is I feel like this is like you know Elliot being the

23:57.160 --> 24:05.200
as I said the quintessential example of what a you know the port leader in the

24:05.200 --> 24:12.280
broke culture movement would be this is great this is great advice he speaks

24:12.280 --> 24:17.840
about humility he speaks about he doesn't speak about mere like peace

24:17.840 --> 24:22.160
unanimous weak humility but he speaks about genuine humility he speaks about

24:22.160 --> 24:27.480
the dangers of pride and you know as our culture has become more and more secular

24:27.480 --> 24:32.960
and more materialistic we don't really talk about those let's say higher human

24:32.960 --> 24:38.160
virtues anymore and when I was younger before you know I understand Elliot was

24:38.160 --> 24:42.880
kind of evangelizing he has become very religious but even before he became sort

24:42.880 --> 24:47.440
of the track on bro he used to talk a lot about these things in the middle of

24:47.440 --> 24:51.800
the strength cam strongman videos he would give really good life advice and

24:51.800 --> 24:57.760
I wouldn't even go to his channel for life advice per se as like a teenager but

24:57.760 --> 25:02.520
he'd you know slip it in somewhere and then I'm and I think to myself oh that's

25:02.520 --> 25:05.520
actually that's a that's a gem right there that's quite interesting you know

25:05.520 --> 25:10.280
when he's for example he spoke about how depression and pride or depression and

25:10.280 --> 25:15.840
this sense of euphoria and and eternal happiness or whatever you may call it

25:15.840 --> 25:20.360
it's the same side of the same is a is a different side of the same coin that's

25:20.360 --> 25:25.240
a very very brilliant insight that that shows he's got a perspicuity a

25:25.240 --> 25:33.040
perspicuity and which is why I think messages like this all these workshops

25:33.040 --> 25:37.520
and and different seminars that they organize in these communities it

25:37.520 --> 25:42.840
provides community it provides brotherhood and fatherhood you know we I

25:42.840 --> 25:48.080
believe definitely are living in the midst of a loneliness pandemic a lot of

25:48.120 --> 25:52.680
people I can speak you know through my personal anecdotes through personal

25:52.680 --> 25:58.360
conversations conversations I've had and stuff I've read are lonely

25:58.360 --> 26:03.760
unfortunately due to unfortunately modernity after industrialized

26:03.760 --> 26:11.160
industrialization and you you know how how how how capitalism has

26:11.160 --> 26:15.960
completely been so pernicious in our society and made people into cogs in

26:15.960 --> 26:21.600
this massive machine it's alienated us and that has created a lot of loneliness

26:21.600 --> 26:29.040
that along with you know traditional little traditional small-scale communities

26:29.040 --> 26:32.440
that dying off and people are becoming more cosmopolitan and people are going

26:32.440 --> 26:37.920
to cities these smaller communities that with the epicenters of meaning and

26:37.920 --> 26:43.080
community with them dying off definitely a lot of people are feeling a lot more

26:43.080 --> 26:48.720
alienated ironically even though we think we have connected and all of this

26:48.720 --> 26:53.320
yearnings all of these yearnings that young men let me let me speak for young

26:53.320 --> 26:57.680
men from over here to young men from over here have you know the yearning for

26:57.680 --> 27:02.880
brotherhood the yearning for structure the yearning for a purpose the broculture

27:02.880 --> 27:06.880
for those years yearnings at least it gave me a structure when I was a lot

27:06.880 --> 27:13.600
younger and it really wasn't really comfortable in my own shoes let's say so

27:13.600 --> 27:18.720
the reason I wanted to put that part in the podcast is I wanted to be genuine

27:18.720 --> 27:25.240
and sincere and show that I'm not being casually dismissive I use that term a

27:25.240 --> 27:29.800
lot these days casually dismissive of these movements and I'm actually they've

27:29.800 --> 27:33.400
actually you know helped me a lot that they've benefited me a lot and I've

27:33.440 --> 27:40.080
even been a part of these movements when I was younger which is why probably I have

27:40.080 --> 27:44.960
more insight into how to criticize them because I understood how a certain

27:44.960 --> 27:51.640
person in a red pill movement with pink now the first this first point is

27:51.640 --> 27:58.480
generally the problem with subcultures not nothing particular specific to the

27:58.480 --> 28:04.360
red pill grows it is that Internet subcultures they kind of become a bit

28:04.360 --> 28:09.640
cultish for sure but they also inevitably go to the extreme and they're

28:09.640 --> 28:14.720
inherently ideological like they cannot exist without being ideological because

28:14.720 --> 28:24.080
they need a dogma they need a doctrine to attract people and then they need and

28:24.240 --> 28:29.800
then that doctrine once it's got enough people it becomes a self-perpetuating

28:29.800 --> 28:35.720
belief it becomes a self-sustaining belief the more people that join these

28:35.720 --> 28:40.400
different communities I also believe and I can't get to this get into this in

28:40.400 --> 28:47.840
this whole in this podcast because it's a it's a whole book but I also believe

28:47.920 --> 28:58.120
that unlike religion ideology never tells a full story whereas religion I

28:58.120 --> 29:02.680
believe gives the complete narrative most religious stories give the complete

29:02.680 --> 29:07.960
narrative ideology tells only one part of the story I think it was Jordan Peterson

29:07.960 --> 29:12.680
who really made this crystallized this in my mind when I heard him talk about

29:12.680 --> 29:17.200
this but I thought that makes a lot of sense so of course I've used to what

29:17.200 --> 29:20.120
ideology a lot I've said that I'm critical of these subcultures I've also

29:20.120 --> 29:24.520
said that I'm critical of the fact that they are ideological plus I'm critical

29:24.520 --> 29:29.000
of the ideology so many things I'm critical of but let's run understand

29:29.000 --> 29:35.160
what ideology is now it's a difficult thing to defend you know ideology isn't

29:35.160 --> 29:40.440
merely a set of principles or a set of beliefs that refuse to update itself it's

29:40.440 --> 29:47.120
a lot more deeper than that it affects us the subject psychologically way way

29:47.120 --> 29:53.120
more deeply than I thought until I was exposed to Slavo Gijek's work so

29:53.120 --> 29:59.000
Slavo Gijek kind of talks about ideology in his film the perverts guide to

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
ideology and he describes ideology best I think here's a short clip

30:05.040 --> 30:10.840
hey buddy you're gonna pay for that or what

30:14.280 --> 30:21.040
look buddy I don't want no house today either pay for it or put it back

30:21.040 --> 30:29.480
according to our common sense we think that ideology is something blurring

30:29.480 --> 30:37.800
confusing our straight view ideology should be glasses which distort our

30:37.800 --> 30:45.920
view and the critique of ideology should be the opposite like you take off the

30:45.920 --> 30:53.240
glasses so that you can finally see the way things really are this precisely and

30:53.240 --> 30:59.400
here the pessimism of the film of the leaf is well justified this precisely is

30:59.400 --> 31:04.880
the ultimate illusion ideology is not simply in post on ourselves

31:04.880 --> 31:13.080
ideologies our spontaneous relationship to our social world how we perceive its

31:13.080 --> 31:21.720
meaning and so on and so on we in a way enjoy our ideology alright to step out

31:21.720 --> 31:28.480
of ideology it hurts it's a painful experience you must force yourself to

31:28.480 --> 31:35.240
do it this is rendered in a wonderful way with a further scene in the film

31:35.240 --> 31:43.280
where John Nada tries to force his best friend John Armitage to also put the

31:43.280 --> 31:50.040
glasses on I don't want to fight you I don't want to fight stop it no and it's

31:50.040 --> 31:56.720
the weirdest scene in the film the fight takes eight nine minutes it may appear

31:56.720 --> 32:02.440
irrational because why does this guy reject so violently to put the glasses

32:02.440 --> 32:09.960
on it is as if he is well aware that spontaneously he lives in a lie that the

32:09.960 --> 32:16.040
glasses will make him see the truth but that this truth can be painful can

32:16.040 --> 32:29.400
shatter many of your illusions this is a paradox we have to accept the extreme

32:29.400 --> 32:37.280
violence of liberation you must be forced to be free if you trust simply

32:37.280 --> 32:43.120
your spontaneous sense of well-being or whatever you will never get free what

32:43.400 --> 32:51.640
freedom hurt brilliantly put you know I I think it was only Zizek who really

32:51.640 --> 32:58.800
made me understand how much ideology captivates or even possesses us and once

32:58.800 --> 33:05.680
it does why so difficult for us to let go of it so in that sense I actually feel

33:05.680 --> 33:12.960
a deep sense of empathy with ideologues because you know actually let me let me

33:12.960 --> 33:18.840
read a few excerpts from this essay by Mac Mac Mac Manus on the philosophy of

33:18.840 --> 33:25.600
Zizek he says the appeal of ideology is that it enables us to bring psychic

33:25.600 --> 33:31.320
stability to a social and natural world that is chaotic and broken in and of

33:31.320 --> 33:37.440
itself that's an important point a latter point is something I it took me a

33:37.440 --> 33:41.520
bit of time to understand this of what Zizek is trying to convey according to

33:41.560 --> 33:47.520
Zizek the essence of being it may be even a metaphysical ontological claim is

33:47.520 --> 33:55.320
chaotic so what ideology does it is at as Matt specifies here it gives psychic

33:55.320 --> 34:00.280
stability which is why once we are assessed by an ideology once we become

34:00.280 --> 34:03.800
a let's say the red pill ideology or the feminist ideology or some some

34:03.800 --> 34:09.400
political framework or some socio-political framework that takes hold of

34:09.440 --> 34:15.040
us it fundamentally changes our psychology it fundamentally affects our

34:15.040 --> 34:19.840
psyche and then we just don't want to let go of it because as Zizek says

34:19.840 --> 34:25.400
freedom hurts because freedom really is the is the confrontation of this chaotic

34:25.400 --> 34:32.480
nature of this chaotic essence of being and that's a scary thing and you know

34:32.480 --> 34:36.480
going on with the essay oh by the way the essay is was on a road magazine it's

34:36.480 --> 34:41.040
called the philosophy of Slavo Zizek I haven't read all of Zizek's books for

34:41.040 --> 34:45.760
sure but I've read a lot read and listen to a lot of his lectures and I would say

34:45.760 --> 34:50.160
this essay was quite apt and quite accurate as to what Zizek tries to

34:50.160 --> 34:55.000
convey through his work another excerpt is ideology provides us with a way of

34:55.000 --> 35:00.840
projecting psychic stability onto the world for instance it enables us to

35:00.840 --> 35:06.440
simplify complex socio-political and natural processes into simple party

35:06.480 --> 35:12.080
narratives once again the red pill bros would say all of the problems that men

35:12.080 --> 35:17.760
have are because of feminist or because of modernity or because of you know

35:17.760 --> 35:24.680
neoliberalism or blame it on some group blame it on the other and that is taking

35:24.680 --> 35:31.200
a very complex socio-political change and a natural process of society evolving

35:31.200 --> 35:35.320
and breaking it simply into partisan narratives or breaking it simply into

35:35.320 --> 35:39.880
something a lot more tribal and that's the danger of ideology and this again

35:39.880 --> 35:44.400
I'm still in some sense even though I'm connecting this to the red pill

35:44.400 --> 35:50.440
movement I'm still making a very general point on how anyone is susceptible any

35:50.440 --> 35:54.120
movement is susceptible to ideology including religion of course that's

35:54.120 --> 35:59.960
when it becomes fundamentalism ideology simplifies the chaotic

35:59.960 --> 36:04.480
incompleteness of society and nature and provides us with a firm sense of

36:04.480 --> 36:09.960
identity and values there you go it's what's interesting is you know the

36:09.960 --> 36:14.960
latter point there and provides us with the firm sense of identity and values so

36:14.960 --> 36:19.440
you probably remember I said initially that you know in my part where I was

36:19.440 --> 36:24.080
talking about in defense of bro culture how as a young person these red pill

36:24.080 --> 36:28.960
movements gave me structure gave me a framework to view the world through and

36:29.280 --> 36:35.800
and it took me a long time probably 21 22 and maybe even 23 took me about two to

36:35.800 --> 36:41.440
three years to break out of it because breaking out of it for me it was a

36:41.440 --> 36:47.520
daunting task it perturbed me it brought this sense of existential angst so

36:47.520 --> 36:52.840
again then I man I really hope I don't sound super serious or patronizing when

36:52.840 --> 36:56.920
I say this that's definitely not I'm not trying to say or look at me over here

36:57.000 --> 37:02.120
free from ideology I've got over the red pill movement I've got over all these

37:02.120 --> 37:06.600
different subcultures on the internet and I'm my own person and I'm so like

37:07.160 --> 37:11.480
above them and pointing fingers at them I really hope I'm not doing that I'm

37:11.480 --> 37:15.320
what I'm saying is I totally empathize with why we're attracted to these

37:15.320 --> 37:21.960
movements and how their their doctrines assess us and you know when

37:21.960 --> 37:27.800
Kedricat again was influenced sorry Zizek was again influenced by Kedricat and

37:27.800 --> 37:32.520
you know when when Zizek talks about this how the the essence of the world is

37:32.520 --> 37:37.800
is kind of broken and chaotic I think it comes a lot from absurdism you know of

37:37.800 --> 37:43.240
course popularized by Kamu but Kamu too was influenced by Kedricat and I believe

37:43.240 --> 37:49.320
Kedricat said this very famous paragraph of his in his book either or and I think

37:49.400 --> 37:53.880
this is a very this is this is like typical Kedricat you know with the humor and with the

37:53.880 --> 38:04.760
absurdity but it's also a a it's a it's a typical sentiment of kind of the existentialist it goes

38:04.760 --> 38:12.680
something like this marry and you will regret it don't marry you will also regret it marry or

38:12.680 --> 38:18.680
don't marry you will regret it either way laugh at the world's foolishness you will regret it

38:19.320 --> 38:25.240
weep over it you will regret that too laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it you will

38:25.240 --> 38:31.960
regret both believe a woman you will regret it believe her or not you will also regret it

38:32.680 --> 38:38.280
hang yourself you will regret it do not hang yourself you will regret that too

38:39.000 --> 38:44.280
hang yourself or don't hang yourself you'll regret it either way whether you hang yourself

38:44.280 --> 38:52.120
or do not hang yourself. You will regret both. This gentleman is the essence of old philosophy.

38:56.520 --> 39:01.480
There are some things that are just so true, that the only way to speak about them is through

39:01.480 --> 39:07.240
humor, through fuzz. And I think that's what character God is doing here. And then of course,

39:07.240 --> 39:13.400
another famous line from Camus, he says, man stands face to face with a rational,

39:13.400 --> 39:19.560
he feels within him, he's longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born out of this

39:19.560 --> 39:24.840
confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.

39:27.240 --> 39:35.320
This is deeply true. We all look for psychic stability of some kind to cushion ourselves and

39:35.320 --> 39:41.160
sometimes even extract ourselves from the absurd. And we have no choice. We need to confront the

39:41.160 --> 39:50.600
absurd. So my biggest problem with ideology is, in some sense, ideology makes one a coward.

39:51.480 --> 39:58.120
It tells one that, no, just be comfortable in your own little bubble in this little ideological

39:58.120 --> 40:04.280
framework and do not confront the absurd, do not confront the chaotic nature of the world,

40:04.280 --> 40:10.280
which takes courage. And I believe it's in that confrontation once, once soul matures and when

40:10.280 --> 40:15.640
develops his character and builds those higher virtues that we so rarely speak about these days.

40:17.640 --> 40:23.960
Now, I come to something maybe a bit more specific to the red pill movement. And maybe

40:23.960 --> 40:30.840
actually, since I did speak about Rollo Tomasi a bit earlier in his whole manosphere and because

40:30.840 --> 40:35.880
he even though he touches on politics, and especially he's very, very critical of feminism,

40:36.680 --> 40:43.880
he also focuses a lot on gender dynamics and sexual dynamics and relationships and dating

40:43.880 --> 40:51.160
between men and women. So in his book, The Rational Male, and I think this is the gist of

40:51.160 --> 40:56.120
what I got when I was reading it, but I didn't just want to read it, even though I felt reading

40:56.120 --> 41:02.760
is because important for this particular podcast episode. I also listened to some of his interviews

41:02.760 --> 41:10.680
and a big problem with modern society. And this really angers me. It really annoys me is

41:11.480 --> 41:18.840
we've completely lost ourselves in abstracting and categorizing at infinity. We truly stopped

41:18.840 --> 41:25.800
looking as people as individuals and rather started looking at them as abstractions. And this has

41:25.800 --> 41:32.920
got nothing to do with left, right. It's just, it's a cultural, it's a cultural zeitgeist shift.

41:33.640 --> 41:39.320
You know, because we live in such a globalized world, we've begun to bureaucratize everything.

41:39.320 --> 41:45.000
Everything is becoming rather Kafkaesque and the human individual in some sense is being negated,

41:45.000 --> 41:53.960
as being made into non-being, let's say, because we've completely begun categorizing everything.

41:53.960 --> 41:58.200
Men are this way. Women are this way. Black people are this way. White people are this way.

41:58.920 --> 42:05.400
Ah, I don't want to keep going. Gay people are this way. LGBTQ folks are that way. It never stops.

42:06.360 --> 42:15.240
And the more we do this, the more we demean and the more value we give to the individual souls,

42:16.200 --> 42:22.680
the uniqueness, the idiosyncrasies of the individual, the nuances of being an individual,

42:23.400 --> 42:31.800
we don't pay attention to that anymore. And that again, I do blame a lot for the death of religion.

42:31.800 --> 42:37.400
I do think a lot of religions speak a lot about that kind of individual spirituality, individual

42:37.400 --> 42:43.640
connection with the transcendent, with the divine, and with this kind of abstract categorizing that

42:43.640 --> 42:50.280
rarely happens, seldom does that happen. So, as I said, we've stopped looking at the souls,

42:50.280 --> 42:54.200
we've become categorized people, and it's also become kind of obsessive. You look at

42:54.200 --> 42:58.520
psychologists that talk about the big five and talk about psychometricians, because

42:58.520 --> 43:03.800
fairly, maybe that itself is its own ideology because it's easy. It's an easy way to make

43:03.800 --> 43:09.080
sense of the world when we categorize things and put things in their place and give things order.

43:11.000 --> 43:18.840
I only really started to understand this phenomenon when I read Dostoevsky, especially when I read

43:18.840 --> 43:25.080
this part in the Brothers Karamazov, where I believe Father Zezema is speaking to this

43:25.880 --> 43:30.920
young woman who says that she cannot, Father Zezema, by the way, is one of the

43:30.920 --> 43:36.760
wiser sort of sage-like characters in Dostoevsky's novel, The Brothers Karamazov. So,

43:37.480 --> 43:45.240
he's talking to this young woman who says she cannot love people, she cannot love humanity,

43:45.240 --> 43:48.200
and then he responds with this beautiful paragraph he says,

43:49.400 --> 43:55.320
it's just the same story as a doctor once told me, observe the elder. He was a man

43:55.320 --> 44:02.760
getting on in years and undoubtedly clever. He spoke as frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter

44:02.760 --> 44:10.840
jest. I love humanity, he said, but I wonder at myself, the more I love humanity in general,

44:10.840 --> 44:17.800
the less I love men in particular. In my dreams, he said, I have come, I've often come to make,

44:17.800 --> 44:24.200
to making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually have

44:24.200 --> 44:32.360
face crucifixion if it had been soundly necessary. And yet I am incapable of living in the same room

44:32.360 --> 44:38.760
with anyone for two days together, as I know by experience. As soon as anyone is near me,

44:38.760 --> 44:46.520
his personality disturbs my self complacency and restricts my freedom. In 24 hours, I begin to hate

44:46.520 --> 44:53.240
the best of men, one because he's too low over his dinner, another because he has a cold and

44:53.240 --> 45:00.760
keeps on blowing his nose. That was probably me. I become hostile to people the moment they come

45:00.760 --> 45:07.160
close to me, but it has always happened that the more I detest men individually, the more ardently

45:07.160 --> 45:16.440
my love for humanity. What a, man, you gotta read Dostoevsky, man, like what a, what a brilliant

45:16.440 --> 45:24.200
point, what an astute take on society. Many of these Internet subcultures are making the same

45:24.200 --> 45:30.600
mistake that Father Zezima talks about. As I said, people like Rollo Tomasi, the more I listen to

45:30.600 --> 45:35.960
him on what I hear is, you know, what's funny is he unknowingly does this, he'd even explicitly say,

45:35.960 --> 45:42.360
I'm not generalizing, but then he'll go ahead and generalize. I remember he was having this

45:42.360 --> 45:47.160
conversation with a, with another woman and they were kind of going at it. They were in deep

45:47.160 --> 45:54.280
disagreement. And even when she shared something about her personal life, he instantly took what

45:54.280 --> 46:00.760
the, what she said and tried to abstract it out and put her into some box. I didn't see him

46:01.400 --> 46:07.000
truly paying attention to what her as a unique individual was saying, but he had to

46:07.560 --> 46:12.200
really get the, get the gist of what she was saying and they put her in a box, you're this kind of

46:12.200 --> 46:17.960
woman. And I think that's really unfortunate because, you know, whether, whether he disagreed

46:17.960 --> 46:22.600
or agreed with her, it doesn't, it's not the case. It doesn't matter. It's paying attention to what

46:22.600 --> 46:28.840
her as an individual was saying, which is, you know, to be fair, what the psychoanalyst discovered,

46:28.920 --> 46:35.400
you know, the Freud's that you got to truly, truly listen to a person as to what they're saying.

46:35.400 --> 46:41.080
Don't try and make assumptions. Don't try and pigeonhole them. Don't try and put them in boxes.

46:41.080 --> 46:48.520
Just pay attention. So all of these subcultures, subcultures, they unknowingly categorize women,

46:48.520 --> 46:54.280
men, and relationships to the extreme. And yes, this may be beneficial for some people,

46:54.280 --> 47:00.200
but I think what that does is again, this is something, this is ineffable.

47:01.240 --> 47:03.720
It truly is, this is ineffable human experience.

47:05.560 --> 47:11.320
It can't even be spoken of. And I think we really feel it only when we pay attention.

47:12.360 --> 47:20.920
When we do this kind of categorizing and generalizing, we lose that. It's a magical,

47:20.920 --> 47:26.360
beautiful thing. It's a life sustaining thing. And I feel like a lot of us in modernity have lost

47:26.360 --> 47:34.280
that. And to be fair, this is no different to what a radical feminist or someone in Antifa or

47:34.280 --> 47:38.520
some other ideologue would do. This again is a problem with ideology. And which is why I think

47:39.080 --> 47:43.880
even though one can take certain lessons from the Red Perk community, like the lesson that

47:43.880 --> 47:51.000
Elliot gave about porn and NOFAP and all of that, one should never completely let the ideology

47:51.960 --> 48:00.360
control one and become a mouthpiece for the ideology. And not to never be afraid to think

48:00.360 --> 48:05.800
freely and think independently. It is the most important thing. It's having the courage

48:06.760 --> 48:11.240
to confront the chaos of the world and to truly be an independent thinker. One should never forget

48:11.240 --> 48:18.120
that. I would also say maybe this is a bit of an ancillary point, but I think it's connected.

48:18.840 --> 48:23.800
As the book itself says, it's the rational male. All these books are called the rational male. So

48:23.800 --> 48:31.960
Robo Tamasi deeply respects reason. And generally people who tend to be the rationalist types,

48:31.960 --> 48:38.200
the Stephen Pinkers, people who hold reason to be the highest virtue, let's say, they tend to play

48:38.280 --> 48:44.840
a lot in this abstract game, in this game of abstractions and conceptualization. So the Rolo,

48:44.840 --> 48:52.280
in some sense, one can never win a debate with Rolo because he would say the moment, let's say we

48:52.280 --> 48:57.800
make an experiential claim, not an axiomatic truth, maybe make an experiential claim from our own

48:57.800 --> 49:04.600
subjective life, not some kind of sadistic or objective claim that just generally applies to

49:04.600 --> 49:09.480
everyone, but rather a subjective claim. He'll say, you're being irrational. Therefore, you lose

49:09.480 --> 49:15.640
the debate. So he's already set the axioms or he's already set the rules for a conversation

49:16.200 --> 49:21.240
even before we get into a conversation. So there's no way, which is why Rolo Tamasi is

49:21.240 --> 49:27.560
kind of the Ben Shapiro. So some of those guys, you rarely see them lose a debate because the

49:27.560 --> 49:32.440
framework they view through is that of reason. And again, I'm not being critical of reason.

49:32.440 --> 49:38.280
Reason is important. In some sense, I'm using reason in this podcast to flesh out my points and

49:39.000 --> 49:48.200
lay out my criticisms. But reason isn't the only form of epistemology, let's say. It's not the only

49:48.200 --> 49:54.760
way at truth. There are many ways. For me, in some sense, I probably value experiential truth more

49:54.760 --> 50:02.440
than even reason-based truth. Because for me, in some sense, once experience is more palpable,

50:02.440 --> 50:09.640
it's more real. It's what one truly feels. And I would say, to end off this segment,

50:11.880 --> 50:17.640
the truth is, we're all deeply lonely. No one will truly ever understand us. We must accept this

50:17.640 --> 50:24.360
verity that we are all deeply lonely. No one, not even once wife, once partner would truly know

50:25.640 --> 50:31.000
what happens in one's mind, what experiences we have. So the loneliness itself is an

50:32.760 --> 50:37.480
existential part of life. I think Paul Tillich talks about, in his phenomenology, he talks

50:37.480 --> 50:43.320
about the concept of anxiety. And he talks about meaninglessness a lot. But meaninglessness is

50:43.320 --> 50:48.760
one thing. But even, I think Paul Tillich also touches on the idea of us as being lonely, us as

50:48.760 --> 50:54.680
being like an atom detached from being, this incongruence we feel between ourselves and the

50:54.680 --> 51:05.400
world. And we must confront this is no other way. Ideology isn't going to rescue us, I put it that

51:05.400 --> 51:15.880
way. And now, this may be, oh man, on the whole dating thing, I couldn't believe some of the messages

51:16.600 --> 51:24.040
either explicitly or tacitly that these communities give out. I'm going to be honest,

51:24.040 --> 51:30.520
it rather disgusted me. Some of the ways that they generalize women, and they say that women are

51:30.520 --> 51:38.760
like this, women are this kind of men. And I rarely, rarely hear these groups talk about love,

51:38.840 --> 51:45.960
various love in dating. I don't think I even hear the word love come out. Because essentially,

51:45.960 --> 51:51.720
for me, that's what dating is about. I date for love, for monogamy, for marriage, for deep

51:51.720 --> 51:57.960
commitment. And all these communities, you know, people, let's say from the man's sphere or the

51:58.520 --> 52:05.960
red pill dating communities, make the whole relationship thing like a game. That it's just a

52:06.200 --> 52:11.160
zero sum game where you got to one up each other and you got to win. You know, they'll use terms like

52:11.160 --> 52:18.440
sexual marketplace or sexual market value, detrimental terms. They use terms like economically

52:18.440 --> 52:27.800
attractive. And they'll completely commoditize individuals or women in this case. And you know,

52:27.800 --> 52:33.000
that definitely is because of how pernicious I think capitalism has become. And in some sense,

52:33.000 --> 52:39.240
this is what Zizek, you know, who's very, very critical of capitalism says. It's not that ideology

52:39.240 --> 52:47.160
that the ideology of capitalism has just this detached system that just exists on its own.

52:47.160 --> 52:52.920
It deeply affects us, the subjects who are involved in it. And as a result of that, which is why

52:52.920 --> 52:58.920
even something like dating, which I believe should be undergirded by love, becomes a marketplace,

52:58.920 --> 53:05.160
becomes an economical transaction. And the more I listen to, you know, even when I was reading the

53:05.160 --> 53:08.680
book, you know, they talk about concepts like hypergamy. And I understand that a hypergamy

53:08.680 --> 53:15.000
definitely has a lot of evidence for it. But still, the, they'll say some facts. So we, we,

53:15.000 --> 53:19.240
we run into the, you know, it's all problem, they'll state some facts. This is how things are. And the

53:19.240 --> 53:29.880
odd would be, the odd would be this sort of cajoled or this contrived idea of, of the ideological

53:29.880 --> 53:36.200
presuppositions. And, you know, honestly, some of them make women look like these self-serving,

53:37.240 --> 53:43.240
rapacious capitalists who only date men for, for pretty much for social status or money.

53:44.440 --> 53:48.840
I would say, man, I really recommend this video by Olivia. I'm not going to play the whole thing

53:48.840 --> 53:55.560
because it's 20 minutes. It's called Our Conception of Love is Messed Up. It's such a beautiful video.

53:55.560 --> 54:02.360
I truly resonate with what Olivia says here. She's a great YouTuber. I'll leave a link to it down in

54:02.360 --> 54:07.880
the description. I'd probably play it. And also Bell Hooks, President Peace Queen, say we need to shift

54:07.880 --> 54:11.960
our perspective. Anyway, I'm not going to, I'm not going to play the whole thing because it's 25

54:11.960 --> 54:18.840
minutes. And she talks about how a modern conception of love is all about how can I

54:19.640 --> 54:24.040
better myself? How can I look better? How can I look more healthy, you know, so that I can

54:24.040 --> 54:29.800
be more attractive to my partner? And she says, instead, why not treat love like an art? Why not

54:29.800 --> 54:35.880
treat dating of how can I give myself to the other person? How can I fulfill the other person's needs?

54:36.440 --> 54:43.640
And instead of saying, how can I better myself? How can I play this game? And then if the other

54:43.640 --> 54:49.960
person has a bad day, if the other person doesn't reciprocate, reciprocate, then this person's not

54:49.960 --> 54:55.640
for me. I don't love this person. Like love is, you know, in that sense, love is metaphysical. Love

54:55.640 --> 55:02.440
isn't a mere transactional thing. And, you know, Olivia makes a good point that love has to be

55:02.440 --> 55:09.720
detached from capitalist ideology. For me, I was talking a bit about absurdism before.

55:10.680 --> 55:16.920
For me, essentially the antidote to absurdism and this sense of meaninglessness is love.

55:16.920 --> 55:21.560
It's not just love in relationships and dating, of course, it's not just romantic love, but it's,

55:21.560 --> 55:27.720
you know, love within family, you know, what's it called? Is it filial love? I forget, love within

55:27.720 --> 55:37.000
friends, and even if possible, love for humanity as a whole, as a whole. And when we view this whole

55:37.000 --> 55:46.440
thing as some zero sum game, it truly corrupts it, it attains it. And I would say this, and I really

55:46.440 --> 55:54.040
want to make this point. Love is terrifying. It's beautiful than terrifying. I've fallen in love

55:54.040 --> 55:59.080
twice in my life. The first time it was beautiful than terrifying. The second time it's beautiful

55:59.080 --> 56:05.000
than terrifying. And in some sense, I had no, I had no, it wasn't up to my own volition. I had no

56:05.000 --> 56:11.080
choice in falling in love, which is probably why they call it the fall. And, you know, the whole

56:11.080 --> 56:17.560
red pig communities and the people like Rollo Tamasi make it look like pick some boxes and

56:17.560 --> 56:22.520
completely plan it out. And then you'll find the perfect woman, the ideal woman that you

56:22.520 --> 56:28.280
want to spend the rest of your life with. But that's not true. Life, life doesn't work like that.

56:28.280 --> 56:35.320
You know, yeah, you could write a book, you could make some very smart, rationalistic arguments

56:35.320 --> 56:40.120
and contrive them, you know, using some, using language, but in real life, and this is kind of

56:40.120 --> 56:47.240
why I said, I spoke earlier about paying attention to one's subjective experience, one's deep,

56:47.240 --> 56:57.880
personal being. Love is a risk. And, and, and I truly believe that there truly isn't any substance

56:57.880 --> 57:03.240
to one's soul without risk and faith, which is why love takes courage for sure. But, but it also

57:03.240 --> 57:09.320
takes a leap of faith. It's not a mere game or it's not a mere, it's not like a job interview

57:09.320 --> 57:13.800
where you take some boxes and you work through some framework. It's, it's metaphysical, it's

57:13.800 --> 57:19.720
spiritual, it's beyond that. And it's true that I think one truly becomes a complete person. It's

57:19.720 --> 57:24.760
through that risk, through that character guardian leap of faith. And keep in mind character guard

57:24.760 --> 57:30.600
never said, when you take the leap, the landing is soft. The landing can be terrible. Nevertheless,

57:30.600 --> 57:35.960
one has to take the leap. And which is why it is not a, I'm not making a rational case here. You

57:35.960 --> 57:41.960
might, everything I'm saying may, may sound like nonsense, but I guess I would say

57:42.280 --> 57:47.880
don't even listen to what I'm saying, pay attention to what your heart's saying, pay attention to

57:48.760 --> 57:53.400
where your heart's leading you. And that, that takes practice. It's not easy to be attentive,

57:53.400 --> 58:00.360
attentive to oneself. You know, I would also say another thing about hypergamy and women's

58:00.360 --> 58:06.600
liberation. So firstly, I want to play this clip by Djejec. He talks about marriage. I think it's

58:06.600 --> 58:15.320
a beautiful, beautiful clip from a recent interview he did. And, you know, Djejec also influenced

58:15.320 --> 58:22.360
me to get this view of love. So one thing the Red Pearl community, all the Red Pearl bros say is

58:22.360 --> 58:27.800
that because, you know, women are liberated now, you know, women don't have to rely on men.

58:28.840 --> 58:35.880
Let's say for financial needs, women can earn as much as men want to earn. They can have their

58:35.880 --> 58:41.560
own careers. They can have their own life. And therefore this whole concept of hypergamy,

58:42.520 --> 58:48.200
it's probably not, it's probably, well, hypergamy still exists, but it's not how it probably

58:48.200 --> 58:55.320
traditionally existed where women relied on men as being the providers, as being the breadwinners

58:55.320 --> 59:02.840
of a family, but rather men and women both have independence to fend for themselves.

59:03.080 --> 59:09.960
And what Djejec says, which is fantastic, is that women's liberation has actually

59:09.960 --> 59:15.160
has actually given way for genuine love. You know, and maybe this is a, there you go,

59:15.160 --> 59:19.880
a good thing about capitalism because the free market has given that kind of freedom that

59:21.560 --> 59:27.560
the liberation of the genders has given way for true genuine love where a man and woman can

59:27.560 --> 59:32.040
be in a relationship, can get married if they truly love each other and for nothing else,

59:32.040 --> 59:38.520
not for any financial benefit or not for any kind of, as I said, game in the sexual marketplace

59:38.520 --> 59:44.680
or some game of hypergamy could truly be something metaphysical in that sense. And I want to make

59:44.680 --> 59:49.160
this, play this clip by Djejec when he talks about marriage, which by the way for me

59:50.440 --> 59:56.440
is the deepest manifestation of love. It's the most, maybe the highest thing one could do

59:56.440 --> 01:00:01.240
symbolically to declare one's love. And here's what Djejec says.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:09.000
I think that precisely because it no longer has this economic function. Marriage today

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.960
can be something beautiful. It's just a pure commitment. You say basically to society,

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:22.840
I care for this person more than for anybody else. I want to be, it's just for me,

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:33.400
it can survive marriage as a commitment to share a world with somebody. For me, okay, sex is beautiful,

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:39.960
passion at night, whatever. But as we all know, then when you awaken, no, there is a problem.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:47.000
And here true love begins for me. You know, when you, it's not just we were all the night doing it,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.800
but when you have to build patiently small daily rituals, daily life, who will clean the toilet?

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:59.720
Who will do this? Who will do that? All these wonderful small rituals. How do you prepare

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:07.880
breakfast? We go there. And that's for me the true miracle of marriage, this commitment of two.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:13.480
That's why I also, maybe this will be disappointed to your readers. I don't believe in this fashionable

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.400
notion of polyamory. You know, oh, I can love more persons.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:22.760
Any other relationship? I don't, I'm not a moralist. I don't care if people do it.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:31.960
For me, but for me, there is still something absolutely exclusive about loving just one person.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:39.240
Because, you know, because, how should I put it, when you have polyamory open relationships,

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:46.120
it's usually too pragmatic. It's, I have different needs. Let's say for intelligent talks or whatever,

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:53.320
I need you for intense sex. I need you for fun. I need you. That's not love for me. Love is not

01:01:53.320 --> 01:02:00.680
about satisfying your needs. Love is kind of a more metaphysical even, absolute trust. Love is,

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:06.680
I cannot live without you. And I'm ready to change radically just to be with you. In this sense,

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:15.800
I would say, I don't know what will happen. Just let's not get rid of marriage because

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:22.840
precisely today in our crazy world of all this, you know, the ideology today is experiment with

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:28.920
yourself. This is typical American ideology. Don't get fix on something. Different partners,

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:35.720
different sexual orientations. Today, you are heterosexual, make some homosexual experiments,

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:40.760
make some group orgy experiments and so on and so on. I don't find this satisfying.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:49.560
Man, I can't even put into words how deeply I resonate with what Gijek's saying. I, you know,

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:54.920
I've never been on dating apps. And again, I'm not critical of dating apps. I know a lot of people

01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:01.880
who found great partners through dating apps. But the reason I never was on dating apps,

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.440
dating apps was because well, I was in a long term relationship for about two and a half years.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:12.200
So I really need one. But other than that, even after I broke up with my ex-partner, I

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:18.440
pulled about it for a while. And then before I met my, you know, current, the current partner

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:25.000
during that period, interim period, let's say, I realized, I don't want to play that game where,

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:30.680
you know, as Gijek was saying, the game of experimentation, you know, I tried this woman,

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:37.320
I tried this woman, I tried this woman. It felt like, again, I was reducing women to just a mere

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:46.440
commodity and just a mere bunch of boxes or categories that I'm ticking off. And for me,

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:54.280
that's not what love is. For me, love is a risk. It's love is, it's a fall and love is painful.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:59.560
But one, one must experience all of life as that, as that poem by

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:08.280
Eurelke goes, actually, let me pull it up the poem. I've got the poem, actually, I think I've got it on my,

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:16.920
I've got it saved up. Let's see. Oh, I don't want to show any of my, let me just switch the camera

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:25.000
because this is my personal notion. It's this poem called, Go to the Limits of Your Belonging by

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.720
Ren and Marie Eurelke. And there's one verse in the poem that goes, let everything happen to you,

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:39.080
beauty and terror, just keep going, no feeling is final, don't let yourself lose me. I love that

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:44.440
idea of let everything happen to you. And I think it's in love, everything happens to a person,

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:52.920
the good, the bad, the ugly. So in any case, my point being, all of these subcultures, as I've

01:04:53.560 --> 01:05:01.240
said many times, not probably ad nauseam, have their utility. They really do. But the way to

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:06.120
truly utilize these subcultures, the Red Bull Movement, the Manisphere, even, you know, books like

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:13.320
this, like by Rolo Tamasi on dating and meeting them, which again, great advice, is by having a

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:20.360
sort of paradigm shift. And it's essentially a philosophical paradigm shift of looking, of how

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:26.840
we as individuals look at other individuals and other women. I'm just being specific to the

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:32.840
whole dating thing and how we look at other people as souls and how we experience love.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:40.120
And I would even say this, you see, this whole podcast, I'm essentially giving a irrational

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:46.440
message because I'm telling to let people make mistakes. I'm telling let people even experience

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:53.240
misery by the mistakes they make without prescribing an ideology onto them. That's what I truly

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:59.480
believe. I think that's what truly develops the human soul and truly gives person the vast array

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:04.920
of the human experience. Because if not, we're perpetually going to be stuck. Not if not, we

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:10.760
actually are always perpetually stuck in a yes or problem. Yes, we have a bunch of facts,

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:17.320
but we derive the odd from it. That's the important part. How do we derive the odd from the yes?

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:24.680
And ideology will say easy, just view the odd or derive the odd through this framework and it's

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:33.160
done. It requires no risk. It requires no thinking. It requires no experience. But I think that leaves

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:41.000
a person empty and it makes one's life rather insipid to be frank. Thanks for listening.
