0	4320	You said that it was, well, initially human nature or
4320	8480	understanding human nature, but also reading Chomsky, which is
8480	11480	clear from reading your work, your, I don't want to call you a
11480	13640	Chomsky, and that's like a crass fear of putting it, but it
13640	18760	seems like you're settling more on, let's say, Chomsky side over
18760	23180	someone like BF Skinner. And so if I would, if you don't mind, I
23180	28920	would love for you to sort of elucidate this ongoing, I don't
28920	33160	want to call it a war, but debate between the Skinner side
33240	37160	and Chomsky side. And in fact, in one podcast, you even said
37160	39600	that this debate is still ongoing. It's not like it's
39600	44520	Yeah, yeah, very much so. Nothing, nothing changes.
44960	47560	Yeah, there's not a conclusion. This is the answer sort of
47560	50040	thing, which is which is what's lovely about science in my
50040	53960	view. So what's this debate in linguistics and cognitive
53960	57200	science between Chomsky and Skinner?
57760	64560	So that debate at the time was how to explain behavior and
64640	69760	generally in linguistic behavior in particular, and Skinner was
69760	75320	hoping to explain that in terms of properties of the information
75320	79000	that's available to us, what's out there in the environment and
82520	86800	responses and the links between them and associations that we
86800	92280	formed between them. And basically, the idea is that to
92320	97080	explain how we behave, which is all he cared about, all we need
97080	100800	to do is look at the properties of what's out there rather than
100800	105480	what the organism brings internally to that how the
105480	109920	organism views the stimulus and how the organism chooses to
109920	116120	response. And what Chomsky made very clear is that the study of
116120	119400	behavior ought to start with the study of the organism, it's
119400	122440	really kind of maybe you can think about it as a form of
122440	128080	biology thinking about what is it that the organism brings with
128160	134080	themselves to to this task. So to make it very, you know, very
134080	139520	concrete. So why is it that, you know, you you understand a
139520	144080	sentence, how is it, you know, that you have a sentence such as
144600	150480	John is eager to please? How do you know that it's John? Who is
150480	156320	being pleased? Being pleased? Whereas if you know, John is
156880	162880	easy to please, then sorry, put it the other way around. So if
162880	168000	John is easy to please, it is the one who is being pleased is
168000	171840	John, whereas if John is eager to please, then he is pleasing
171840	177600	Bill or somebody else, right? And what Chomsky made clear is
177600	183080	that interpretations such like that, the only way to make sense
183080	188800	of them is to figure out what is it that the person knows about
188800	191760	language and how they encode information that's available to
191760	197640	them. Any pointed out that our ability to do so to encode
197640	202400	information that's available to us is constrained in part by
202440	206520	innate principles of language that he called Universal
206520	207000	Grammar.
207760	211800	And would you say that's sort of something like innate knowledge
211800	213840	that you write about in this book?
213920	218360	Yeah, yeah, yeah. So as I read Chomsky, this is primarily a
218360	222040	treatise on human nature and about innate knowledge, which he
222040	226000	happened to advance in the domain of language. But I always read
226000	228160	him as a philosopher, essentially.
228200	232920	Certainly, yeah, I mean, he in fact, I believe he was the he
233120	236720	chaired the Department of Philosophy at MIT, probably for a
236720	239760	long time. So he has a really good background in philosophy
239760	240280	certainly.
241400	246720	I was professor so with the idea of Universal Grammar, I've
246720	251920	always always been thinking about that idea like is is Universal
251920	255360	Grammar itself, this type of innate knowledge? And is it
255360	259480	something that that we can sort of study analytically?
260240	262240	Oh, and empirically,
262280	265680	empirically, beautiful. And I would say experimentally. Yeah,
265680	270040	so. So all you need is to start with a good theory of what you
270040	274800	think Universal Grammar is all about. And then go to the lab and
274800	277920	try to figure out, do you have evidence for this thing? And it's
277920	279480	not easy, but it's doable.
280640	284320	I see, I see. So if we could play a bit of devil's advocate,
284600	288000	because I've read, in fact, apart from Chomsky's political
288000	290760	work, of course, I've read his book on language, which was which
290760	293320	was an excellent read. And I found it quite hard to read as an
293320	299080	ear five, to be totally honest. But I do know there are certain
299080	302240	people still in the field, as you said, it's an ongoing debate
302280	307400	that kind of are either critical or disagree with some of
307400	312200	Chomsky's ideas, or let's say, values of Universal Grammar. So
312800	317000	what are what are the current criticisms of this idea of innate
317000	318560	knowledge or Universal Grammar?
319080	322080	So to make it clear, I think that in fact, the majority of the
322080	328200	field no longer thinks that no longer sides with Chomsky. I'm
328200	331640	not totally convinced in my reading of the evidence that
332120	338440	that's right. And that's the right conclusion. And the debate
338440	343640	as a debates, as I see it in the domain of language, have always
343640	351400	structured, or have always centered onto issues. One is,
351560	355040	what is the machinery that you need to represent language? So
355040	359400	what kind of representations that you have? And what, and what
359480	363000	and do they are they structured? Are they structured in a
363000	366800	systematic way? Do you need something that is akin to
367000	372800	algebraic rules? Or all you have is basically associations,
372800	376680	very rich set of associations, which apparently this is what
376680	381320	GPT is doing, you know, AI is doing today. So A is what kind of
381320	386680	representations do you have? And do you need explicit structure
386720	393560	in your data, so to speak? The second question is, where these
393600	398000	representations, and the rules, the way you operate over these
398000	402400	representations, where is all this machinery coming from? And
402440	406400	is it in parts specific to language? So are you born with
406400	409080	some principles that are unique to language? And that's what
409080	413920	allows you to acquire language? Or are you relying entirely on
414760	419960	generic mechanisms that operate across domains? So what is
420000	425360	your machinery? And how specific it is, where and where it's
425360	432760	coming from? These are have always been the questions. And
432760	440120	the debate these days are centered on a whether there
440120	443960	are in fact algebraic rules. So this is huge debate about that,
443960	448280	which has been increased and confounded by the rise of AI,
448280	452400	because proponents of that state, like, look, you have the
452400	458280	systems that seem to do just fine. And it's not clear. But
458280	463000	some people, there is a question of whether they in fact have
463000	466960	any algebraic representations at all. And the range of
466960	471520	possibilities range between those who say, there aren't any
471520	475280	structured representations in there at all, or that maybe
475280	479400	they start without them, and they grow them somehow. And all
479400	483240	this becomes really difficult to tell, just because there is so
483240	487640	much data that these systems are exposed to that it's really hard.
487680	490200	So one of the tests that you know, how do you know that there
490200	493640	is an algebraic rules? One of the way to test it is to look at
494200	498320	generalizations, can you generalize to items that are not
498320	501320	similar to anything that you've seen before. But if you're
501320	506880	basically your data set includes everything that we have, then
506880	509840	it becomes very difficult to know whether you'd in fact
509840	512320	generalize or not. So that makes the whole question of
513080	519360	machinery very difficult to decide. Questions of innateness
519360	526200	are difficult to decide for two reasons. A, the success of AI
526200	531440	that kind of presents a big challenge. The other reason is
532600	535360	oftentimes when you point out that there are universals
535360	541360	across languages. So this is one of the main argument or an
541360	545360	important argument to foreign aidness is to argue that, hey,
545400	548560	we look at language after language, and they all show a
548560	552280	certain property. So in my work, we looked at syllable
552280	556720	structure and the fact that languages prefer structures
556720	563920	such as blog to structures such as all bog, LBOG. That seems
563920	568760	very clear. But the thing about this as well as many other
568760	573520	preferences is that there is a correlation between what
573520	577600	languages like to do and what the functional pressures of our
577600	582640	body dictate. So if I ask my undergraduates why blog, then
582640	589560	everybody tells me that what to say. And then intuitive theory
589560	593400	behind it is that it's those functional pressures, meaning
594200	598080	how is it is for you to say the constraints on your
598240	601440	articulatory system and an audition that they're driving
601440	607240	the force. And in every area of language universal, I don't
607480	610920	in many areas of linguistic universals, you find such
610920	615480	correspondences between what languages like to do and some
615480	619520	functional explanation. Phonology is probably the area where you
619520	622480	see those things most clearly. But nowadays, people are
622480	627020	exploring those ideas elsewhere as well. And the problem is that
627040	630540	when people find those correlations, they assume
630540	637080	causation, meaning they if you find any functional explanation
637080	642760	of what's going on, people kind of jump to the conclusion that
642760	647400	it's this functional cause, or functional factor that is
647400	651120	causing the structure that you see. So in this specific case,
651120	654640	why do you prefer a blog? Because it's easy to say, or
654640	657960	because it's easy to hear. That's what my undergraduates
658000	664280	think. And so do professional scientists. And to me, it's not
664280	669240	a done deal. To me, this is an empirical question that you need
669240	673200	to go and explore as indeed we have. And there are ways to do
673200	678320	so. So the fact that you find correlation in principle is
678640	682560	ambiguous between two explanations. One is, it's not
682560	686560	language, it's not your G, it's the functional system, the
686560	689760	sensory and motor systems that are driving the cart here,
689760	695160	that's what makes language the way it is. But the alternative
695160	701640	possibility is, well, maybe it is abstract linguistic principles
701640	706320	that are doing the driving, except for those principles are
706320	711120	not entirely crazy, they're not entirely arbitrary, rather, they
711120	716240	have evolved so that they optimize those sensory and
716240	720160	motor pressures, which I don't think is super surprising. So
720160	723920	that predicts that yes, you will find some correlation between
725160	728320	you know, putative UG and those sensory and motor pressures,
728320	732480	but not but what's doing the pushing was doing what's
732480	736680	pushing the cart, so to speak, is UG rather than sensory motor
736680	740680	system. And merely showing a correlation doesn't adjudicate
740680	744480	between these possibilities. So in my work, we took it very
744480	748320	seriously. So, for example, to figure out whether it's blog
748320	750840	that's doing it, I'm sorry, whether the preference for
750840	754560	blog is coming from, it's easier for you to say than in
754560	758200	collaboration with my colleague, Alvaro Pascualeone, who is a
758400	761600	neuroscientist who does transcarnial magnetic stimulation,
761600	765960	what we did is zapped the motor system that controls the
765960	769480	articulators, the leap specifically, and looked at what
769840	773640	this is doing to your linguistic preferences. And
773640	776880	conversely, what happens when you zap brokers area and what we
776880	782160	found is a dissociation between them. So the point is, these
782160	785560	are questions that you need to explore, you may or may like may
785560	789280	not like the evidence that we produced, I think they're clear,
789280	794480	but the my point is not to defend the solution, but rather to
794480	799320	defend the method. I am very concerned about that time to
799320	802280	jump from correlations to causation, I think this needs
802280	805840	to be sorted out. And I think it's this disagreement that is
805840	809200	behind a lot of the ambiguity that we're having in the field
809200	809800	right now.
810640	814880	April first, I did, in fact, read a blog post written on your
814880	819160	work from your lab by Northeastern University. And so
819160	822760	correct me if I'm wrong, in like a very elementary level, if I
822760	828160	could put it this way, is it that you're at the moment claiming
828200	834160	that it's as if these UG or these abstract principles, they
834160	837480	aren't physical, they aren't arbitrary and random, but they've
837480	841880	kind of evolved to suit our existence as home sapiens, the
841880	845320	same way, let's say a physical limb or something has evolved.
846240	850640	Exactly. Yeah, that's the working hypothesis. But again, I
850640	855760	think for me, it's more important to tell people that just
855760	861200	showing a correlation isn't necessarily proof, it's not a
861200	865720	smoking gun of causation. It's more important for me to emphasize
865720	870760	this methodological claim than to push my own interpretation of
870760	873000	the data. So I think that there's, you know, there is
873000	877560	probably a lot that need to be done, many more controls and to
877600	881000	completely look at this question. And we have contributed some
881000	884000	but by no means I would argue that we completely resolve the
884000	888880	issue. What really bothers me is that the attempt to view the
888880	891800	correlation and to jump to the conclusion that oh, we know what's
891800	894280	going on. I think that's that's really unfortunate.
