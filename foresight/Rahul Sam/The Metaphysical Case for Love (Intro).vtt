Hey everyone, welcome to the reading of my essay, The Metaphysical Case for Love. Now in this video

00:06.000 --> 00:11.520
I'll only be reading the introduction because the whole essay is 15,000 words long, therefore

00:11.520 --> 00:17.200
I'll probably read it in parts and upload it as a video series, but today we're gonna start off

00:17.200 --> 00:24.160
with the introduction. Here goes, The Metaphysical Case for Love. Love has to be rescued from the

00:24.160 --> 00:30.960
love industrial complex. The following is the third of my tripartite essay series on love,

00:30.960 --> 00:35.360
why it matters and the dire need for love's reinvention. I'll leave the links for part

00:35.360 --> 00:40.880
one and two in the description down below, and this is the most philosophically dense piece

00:40.880 --> 00:48.240
in the series, so risk yourself. Our culture endlessly speaks of dating, yet rarely of love.

00:48.240 --> 00:52.560
Partly the reason is the death of sincerity and our overall apathy towards life,

00:52.560 --> 00:58.880
expected in a culture void of metaphysical foundations. Most of us live innocuously,

00:58.880 --> 01:03.840
as the saying goes, we approach life by not touching it with a 10-foot pole.

01:04.640 --> 01:11.360
As is the time of nomadism, where cosmic couchsurfers seldom do we commit to anything or anyone,

01:12.000 --> 01:17.360
be it a political struggle, one's family, or a passionate romance. We'd prefer,

01:17.360 --> 01:23.760
quote-unquote, my freedom over being bothered by the messiness of an engaged and old consuming life.

01:24.800 --> 01:30.720
But, as Marxists understood, the freedom we speak of is a pseudo-freedom to sell our labor,

01:30.720 --> 01:37.360
succumb to the demands of the market economy and be a consumer. That is, the freedom to be a slave

01:37.360 --> 01:44.480
to capitalism. Footnote, consumerism acts by creating false needs in us, the subjects.

01:44.480 --> 01:49.840
They aren't genuine needs that satisfy us but are imposed by our society, or life world.

01:50.640 --> 01:57.200
When you succumb to ideological demands and strive to fulfill these needs, you realize they are

01:57.200 --> 02:03.040
unfulfillable. Nonetheless, you will keep desiring more, consequently loosing your freedom.

02:03.920 --> 02:09.680
For more context, read Chapter 1 of Herbert MacCousa's One-Dimensional Man, and watch this video

02:09.680 --> 02:15.520
by Julian de Medeiros explaining Gisex's theory of Coca-Cola, which I'll link down below, and

02:15.520 --> 02:21.440
footnote. Love also is difficult to speak of because it only makes sense in retrospect.

02:22.160 --> 02:25.120
Doesn't Soren Kerkertgaard's best known saying,

02:25.120 --> 02:31.360
life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards, apply the most to love?

02:32.240 --> 02:35.920
Footnote, the original quote from Kerkertgaard's journals,

02:36.480 --> 02:41.760
it is really true what philosophy tells us, that life must be understood backwards.

02:42.480 --> 02:47.200
But with this, one forgets the second proposition, that it must be lived forwards.

02:47.760 --> 02:54.320
The proposition which, the more it is subjected to careful thought, the more it ends up concluding

02:54.320 --> 03:00.000
precisely, that life at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood.

03:00.960 --> 03:05.520
Exactly because there is no single moment where time stops, completely,

03:05.520 --> 03:09.280
in order for me to take position to do this, going backwards.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.640
End footnote, there perhaps isn't anything more unfathomable than love.

03:15.360 --> 03:20.640
Falling in love is a bizarre experience, because it always hits you by surprise,

03:20.640 --> 03:25.280
thus it's aptly called a fall in English or Thumbehe Meiro in French.

03:26.160 --> 03:31.280
You may be casually dating someone for a while, and suddenly you realize you're in love,

03:31.280 --> 03:36.640
and afterwards, you attempt to rationalize and retrospectively give meaning to your fall.

03:37.600 --> 03:44.720
If the point of love is that, despite it appearing to be predestined, the fall always comes first,

03:44.720 --> 03:52.160
it's fully contingent and unplanned. Therefore, within eros, romance has no technical strategy,

03:52.240 --> 03:58.880
the secret of love is that there is no secret, such as why Slavoj Rizek says the modern dating

03:58.880 --> 04:04.560
approach is flawed. Start quote, the problem with online dating is that it automatically

04:04.560 --> 04:10.800
involves an aspect of self-commodification or self-manipulation. When you date online,

04:10.800 --> 04:17.920
you must present yourself in a certain way, putting forward certain qualities. You focus on your idea

04:17.920 --> 04:23.120
of how other people should perceive you, but that's not how love functions, even at a very

04:23.120 --> 04:29.360
simple level. The English term is endearing foibles, an elementary ingredient in love.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.400
You can't ever fall in love with the perfect person. There must be some tiny small disturbing

04:36.400 --> 04:42.160
element, and it is only through noticing this element that you can say, but in spite of that

04:42.160 --> 04:49.040
perfection, I love him or her. End quote. So, self-help books, dating and relationship coaches

04:49.040 --> 04:55.440
are useless in attempting to make romance a tactical game, epitomized in the self-commodification

04:55.440 --> 05:02.080
done by users of dating apps. If all of poetry, literature and cinema has shown as one thing

05:02.080 --> 05:07.280
since time immemorial, authentic love has no recipe to be conveniently followed.

05:08.240 --> 05:15.040
Does this mean speaking of love is futile? No, because as Peter Rollins writes with a twist on

05:15.040 --> 05:21.200
the famous Wittgensteinian proposition, footnote. Little bit Wittgenstein wrote,

05:21.200 --> 05:28.640
what we cannot speak about, we must pass over in silence and footnote. But Peter Rollins writes,

05:28.640 --> 05:34.480
that which we cannot speak of is the one thing about whom and to whom we must never stop speaking.

05:35.440 --> 05:40.960
Love, not unlike God, is inexhaustible, therefore it ought to be spoken of for eternity.

05:42.160 --> 05:48.640
Now more than ever, philosophers, poets, artists must tackle the subject of love.

05:48.640 --> 05:54.160
It shouldn't be left to be exploited by capitalism and violated by its actors of the

05:54.160 --> 05:59.920
love industrial complex. Dating coaches and apps, pop psychology and self-help books,

06:00.640 --> 06:08.160
relationship podcast, pickup artists, etc. Now more than ever, philosophers, poets, artists

06:08.160 --> 06:14.800
must tackle the subject of love. It shouldn't be left to be exploited by capitalism and violated

06:14.800 --> 06:21.600
by its actors of the love industrial complex, e.g. dating coaches and apps, pop psychology and

06:21.600 --> 06:28.640
self-help books, relationship podcast, pickup artists, etc. Abha Kamu famously wrote,

06:29.520 --> 06:36.400
There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life

06:36.400 --> 06:41.040
is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.

06:41.680 --> 06:47.280
All the rest, whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or

06:47.280 --> 06:53.360
twelve categories, comes afterwards. If I ask myself how to judge that this question is more

06:53.360 --> 07:01.360
urgent than that, I reply that one judges by the actions it entails. I have never seen anyone die

07:01.360 --> 07:06.960
for the ontological argument. Galileo, who held a scientific truth of great importance,

07:06.960 --> 07:12.880
exerted with the greatest ease as soon as it endangered his life. In a certain sense,

07:12.880 --> 07:19.280
he did right. That truth was not worth the stake. Whether the earth or the sun revolves around the

07:19.280 --> 07:25.920
other is a matter of profound indifference. To tell the truth, it is a futile question.

07:25.920 --> 07:31.520
On the other hand, I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living.

07:33.520 --> 07:40.400
Coincidentally, since it's been a predominant reason for people committing suicide, love too

07:40.400 --> 07:43.840
ought to be placed in the position of suicide as a philosophical question.

07:44.720 --> 07:50.240
Can we continue? Suicide has never been dealt with except as a social phenomenon.

07:50.880 --> 07:56.240
Similarly, love, in our times, is dealt with psychologically and scientifically through

07:56.240 --> 08:04.320
neuroscience, neuropsychology, sociology, etc. And this mechanization of love is to our own peril.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.920
A case in point is when psychologist Dr. Shannon Currie

08:07.920 --> 08:15.360
testified in the spectacle of the death versus her trial. Notwithstanding her necessary role

08:15.360 --> 08:22.240
in evaluating the parties for legal and judicial proceedings, she seemingly played the role of a

08:22.240 --> 08:28.480
high priestess for the general public. When her truths are absolute, especially in matters of

08:28.480 --> 08:34.640
romance and love. Of course, neither Currie nor anyone else explicitly states this. But what

08:34.640 --> 08:40.000
matters for critical analysis is what is not said over what is formally proclaimed.

08:41.200 --> 08:48.000
Society tacitly accepts what public-facing psychologists like Currie or more politically

08:48.000 --> 08:55.360
Jordan Peterson says to be truths about being as such, that is ontology, the study of the fundamental

08:55.360 --> 09:01.360
nature of reality. The psychologization of existence is distinctly manifest in our times.

09:02.320 --> 09:08.800
So when a psychologist makes claims on love or politics, for instance, we subliminally accept

09:08.800 --> 09:14.960
these as metaphysical truths. i.e. when Currie was a guest on Lex Friedman's podcast,

09:15.760 --> 09:22.320
she went on to describing falling in love as being high on heroin due to the chemicals pumping in

09:22.320 --> 09:29.680
your brain. Since she does not stipulate her statements with, this is only a neuropsychological

09:29.760 --> 09:37.040
view, we implicitly take her views to be absolute and boil down love to be a neuroscience of sorts.

09:38.880 --> 09:44.960
There is no room for the unknown and no for the speculations that are allowed, or worse,

09:44.960 --> 09:50.560
are considered a waste of time if they don't serve the aforementioned love-industrial complex.

09:51.200 --> 09:57.920
Footnote, I'm not criticizing Dr. Shannon Currie as she doesn't need to include this caveat in

09:57.920 --> 10:04.480
every public conversation. Expecting her to do so would be unreasonable. Unlike Jordan Peterson,

10:04.480 --> 10:10.400
she never claims to be more than a psychologist. However, I only point out the error of our

10:10.400 --> 10:15.040
cultural zeitgeist. Her case serves as an example of this phenomenon.

10:15.840 --> 10:21.040
End footnote. It was Fyodor Dostoevsky who critically delineated the phenomenon of

10:21.040 --> 10:27.600
psychologizing the human condition best. In the Brother's Karamazov, during Dimitri Karamazov's

10:27.600 --> 10:34.560
trial, after being accused of patricide for murdering his father, Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov's

10:34.560 --> 10:41.840
defendant Dimitri's attorney, Fetkovic, says he was forewarned in St. Petersburg and I quote,

10:41.840 --> 10:48.480
that I shouldn't counter here as my opponent a deep and most subtle psychologist who has by this

10:48.560 --> 10:55.520
quality long acquired by merit and a special reputation in our still young judicial world

10:56.080 --> 11:03.280
and continues sadonically, but profound as psychology is, it's a knife that cut both ways,

11:03.280 --> 11:09.200
end quote. In other words, psychology allows us to interpret the same facts in different ways

11:09.200 --> 11:15.360
or in a way that suits our pre-held beliefs. Ergo, we should be wary of treating the discipline

11:15.360 --> 11:21.280
as a whole form of truth because it too, like all human practices, is placed within an ideological

11:21.280 --> 11:28.000
structure. During Dostoevsky's time, forensic psychology was a discipline in nascent forms

11:28.720 --> 11:35.360
and he had a great interest in how it was practiced in the Russian courts. If he were alive today,

11:35.360 --> 11:42.400
he'd have similar comments about the depth be her trial. He wouldn't find fault with science

11:42.400 --> 11:46.960
or the practice of psychology. In fact, he'd load the findings of psychoanalysis,

11:47.520 --> 11:54.160
not a Ben A. Dostoevsky heavily influenced Sigmund Freud with his theories. Yet he would be critical

11:54.160 --> 11:59.680
of ego psychology, today's prevalent form practice in the western world. And being the

11:59.680 --> 12:05.440
romantic Dostoevsky is, he'd find the desire to reduce the human condition to an essence

12:06.080 --> 12:13.040
within the bounds of any academic discipline as an eye. The point being is, yes, love is a

12:13.040 --> 12:20.240
psychological phenomenon, but it is that and much more. To love in all its beauty and terror is the

12:20.240 --> 12:27.200
epitome of human existence. So if there's one thing philosophy needs to tackle, it's what love entails.

12:27.920 --> 12:33.600
Or the rest, whether or not artificial general intelligence is possible, whether capitalism

12:33.680 --> 12:39.920
or socialism is the viable system for our times comes afterwards. What is love is the question

12:39.920 --> 12:43.600
worth asking till the end of time.
