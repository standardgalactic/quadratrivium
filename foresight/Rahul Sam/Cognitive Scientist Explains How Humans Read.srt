1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
So the other bit is and what I love about the book is this is also in a way sort of like a book on

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:13,360
on like social psychology because it's a lot on what laypeople believe and in fact being a layperson

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:21,920
myself I kind of had this belief too for the longest time which is I've always equated what we call

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,120
human language to reading and in the the blind story teller you state in page 203

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,040
if you don't mind me reading it you say many people think of reading as a process of visual

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,960
pattern recognition for example being able to consistently register the contrast between

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,440
symmetrical letters such as D and B if that is the case then it stands to reason that when reading

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:56,160
goes ori the culprit is a visual deficit but but in reality visual patterns are just a means to an

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,040
end which is language reading is a technology that gets you there so uh professor if you could

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,880
delineate what the difference between reading and languages uh that that would be great please

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,320
so there are two things we need to explain what is reading and how it differs from language

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,600
yes so the true theory what is the true science about and the second is what people think how this

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,560
all works so there is the scientific theory and there is the intuitive theory which happens to

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,080
be in disagreement and that's where we mess things up so um so there is a sense in which reading is

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,640
very different from language um I often start my psychology of language classes uh by working really

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
hard to disabuse not people of the notion that language and reading are the same thing they aren't

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,840
language is natural you take every child they will develop language if you don't expose them to

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,880
language they will grow one naturally even they're not exposed to a language um they do it naturally

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,760
they don't need language lessons uh reading is not like that so most children if you don't teach

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,400
them how to read explicitly they will never read there are tons of societies that they're doing

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,440
just well without reading and writing um not so for language so language is universal to all human

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:27,200
societies reading is not so they're divorced in this sense for sure nonetheless there is this

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,400
interesting property of human brains that the neuroscientist Danislas de Han has pointed out

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,720
which is when human brains come to invent a new system they don't invent it completely a new

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,320
but rather what they do is recycle existing systems that are innate and kind of repurpose

26
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,280
them for the new uh for this new purpose and the link between reading and language exactly

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:05,760
follows those lines so when you look at how reading systems are designed they could have been

28
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,200
completely divorced from language they could have been completely arbitrary but that's not the case

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,880
because the letters that we use for a system like a phobetic system like English correspond to

30
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:28,800
linguistic sounds for the most part um even in writing systems as in Mandarin it's true that there

31
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,840
are visual origins of the symbols that they call they also have semantic component but eventually

32
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,160
what they stand up for is also phonological sounds they spend they they stand for syllables

33
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,920
so it turns out that when uh people come to invent language they kind of design it on the

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,920
principles of how language works you can think about it in terms of human brains when they start

35
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,680
processing language they start with the phonology and then so when you perceive speech that the

36
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,280
first thing that you get is the sound structure of language and from there you proceed to syntax

37
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,320
and so forth so it's like to go on the linguistic highway so to speak in the brain you need to start

38
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,400
by having some phonological code so if you're trying to hijack the same highway to create

39
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:31,360
reading you better start by doing by encoding phonology as well and that's how explain the

40
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,000
correspondence between how reading works and how language works reading as a system is taking the

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,200
language or or hijacking a component of the language system and repurposing it to for a new

42
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:57,520
technology and that is why all reading systems that we know encode some phonological units at

43
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,600
some level it doesn't necessarily need to be at the level of phonemes it could be syllables but

44
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:09,200
there is also some phonological component there is ton of research that shows that when you and I

45
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,320
read well I'm not a native speaker but when I read in my language and you read in your language

46
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:23,120
even though we read silently we will automatically extract all this phonological component as

47
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,560
integral part of the reading process so you think about reading as a visual affair it's something

48
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:36,960
that happens only in your eyes of course it begins with the eyes but it looks like it invariably

49
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,360
goes through the phonological system at some point or else reading does not work as it should

50
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,400
so you must get some aspects of the phonology of what you read how do we know that because if

51
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,920
you get two words that have the same phonology such as rose the flower and roses in two rows of

52
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:06,560
chairs people confuse them all the time even if you'll have ROZE which is not the word people will

53
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,440
also confuse them and using the proper experiments you can show that it's really the phonology that

54
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,600
that confuses them which shows that people have consulted this information or else they would

55
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:31,120
not have been confused so the point about showing how we stumble is to show how reading actually

56
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,560
works and the fact that it actually works is using phonology it's using this part of language

57
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,240
so that's the real theory of reading and we also know that when you know that the ability to perceive

58
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,480
sounds is so it's not just phonology but also speech when the ability to perceive speech sounds

59
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:57,440
is impaired this is a characteristic of dyslexia so people with dyslexia have problem with perceiving

60
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:07,840
speech sounds now that's not that what laypeople think so if you ask a layperson you know johnny

61
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,680
can't read here you know he's a six year old and he can't read what do you think is wrong with him

62
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,280
and invariably people tell you there is something that's wrong with their eyes and if they think

63
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,920
that there is something that's wrong with billy because of jimmy whatever i guess and that if the

64
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,680
problem is congenital which we know that's the case in dyslexia that that um it is a congenital

65
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,640
disorder people invariably think the problem can only be in the eyes it can't be the

66
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:50,560
abstract phonological thing um this arises from this intuition that people hold that what's

67
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,080
we hold innately so if you know that the problem is congenital that he was born with that then it

68
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,120
must be somewhere in their body the people don't think just genes they think like in the eyes in

69
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,600
the ears it can be something that is abstract that doesn't make sense that the ability to so what

70
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,000
dyslexia really is about is in part the mechanism that allow you to map letters to sound and which

71
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,160
is an abstract kind of cognitive mechanism and people have trouble recognizing that something

72
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:32,880
like that could possibly be um involved or or or impaired innately so this is unfortunate because

73
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:41,040
um it's uh first because people misunderstand what dyslexia is all about and and that's a problem

74
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,800
because um if you think that you know if you have a child and you think that the only signal of

75
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:55,120
dyslexia is switching letters then you will find fail to identify and and and um help these children

76
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,800
with uh early as they need to as you need to um but indirectly it also tells you some something

77
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,600
about how we think about what is innate and what is inateness and um uh and explain some of the

78
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,720
other biases that I've shown in this book uh that show how our misconception about what

79
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:27,440
about how what what is innate uh lead us to this crazy conclusion that what we know cannot possibly

80
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:39,280
have an innate basis
