1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
Paul to put it very generally is a youtuber and commentator. However to get a bit of a let's say comprehensive

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,680
Bio I'm just gonna read out his YouTube channel bio as an introduction to this episode

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,440
It starts off by saying make centrism greater gain

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,600
So you I guess you need a not a mega but like a mega. Yeah, I want to make it like the centrism great again

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,880
So mech. Oh, sorry make enlightened centrism

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,360
Would be the mecha one if they give me a vol that I can make a slogan out of that could be now make centers and great again

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,120
We'll be good for now. That could be a much idea. Um, yeah

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,760
And then you state on this channel

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,720
I upload videos that can more or less be described as cultural than political analysis

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,960
Just as importantly I talk about my experiences as a person and how they inform my beliefs and most importantly my actions

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,720
Pause just a comment there. That's something I I love about your channel. I think you

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,480
You always connect let's say

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,720
So-called abstract theory into your own personal life. I think that's quite important, especially

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,200
Given that we have embodied physical beings and we aren't just ideas

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,600
So I just want to put that out there. I really appreciate that you do that even in the wash debate

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,520
You didn't talk about your experience with Jordan Peterson, which I'm hoping we could discuss today

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,880
Anyway, I'll continue. I believe the best way to resist

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,000
ideological extremism is by offering a better path forward through

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,360
multidisciplinary

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,680
Majoritarianism making to kind of flesh out what that term means

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,640
This is a multifaceted attempt to reaffirm the beliefs that I think the southern majority of people still hold

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,360
A desire for unity individualism and common-sense reforms of my decaying

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,320
cultural and political institutions. I reached out to Paul

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,160
Asking if he'd want to do a follow-up episode after his debate with the wash

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,200
and

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,840
The floor is yours Paul. Just yeah, well you missed it. You missed the last line of my YouTube bio

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,800
The last line looking let me there's a line that you miss at the end I copy it across

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,840
Oh, is this the part about you being a comedian for

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,360
For legal purposes everything I do is comedy. I certainly have read that out

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,120
For legal purposes, this is a comedy channel. Oh, that's right

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,680
Or should I say for legal purposes? Paul is a comedian. Exactly

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,760
It's just jokes. Yes to any people who may be offended or current or future employees everything I do is comedy

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,760
Yeah, cuz you know

34
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,740
You now use your real name, isn't it the last time we spoke you went by pf young

35
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,800
I didn't even call you Paul. I was just calling you pf young. I think oh, yeah

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,960
I think early early when I first uploaded the videos. I just use my real name

37
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:06,080
I mean, I'm Paul on I've said my last name before I just I just generally don't say it to add one more step in case

38
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,400
anyone wants to

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,900
Docs me and send dead animals to my family

40
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,300
but

41
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,220
No, I made it conscious decision

42
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,620
I didn't want to pf young is a channel name and people can call me pf young

43
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,420
but I you know, I always introduce myself as Paul and it's actually interesting because

44
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,180
Usually I do

45
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,860
This Paul P

46
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,580
If

47
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,500
There that's how I usually have my

48
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,500
Message oh in zoom. No, I changed it my little name at the bottom

49
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,660
parentheses also known as

50
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:56,820
To your point about like I talk about my experiences. I am a real person here and I don't like

51
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,780
The idea of like I'm you know, I'm pf young and I'm some sort of character that I'm not yeah

52
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,620
Yeah, not behind the camera, right and

53
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,220
So, yeah, so that's there's a there's a conscious element of that

54
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,540
I would I would I would just go by my full name if I you know, wasn't worried about crazy people constantly trying to

55
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,700
ruin everyone's life, but it just one added a interesting thing

56
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,740
especially when you're on the internet man, and you I mean, I mean the other thing is

57
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,700
You're not a guy. I don't know that does let's say

58
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,860
Well, I'm gonna assume this innocuous tech reviews or

59
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,900
Something that's like, I don't know lifestyle blogs you in fact

60
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,220
Yeah, it's I talk about controversial stuff. So it's quite controversial. So I right certainly good to take some measures

61
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,220
But yeah, as I said the flow is yours Paul just I

62
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,820
Appreciate like a stream of consciousness. Just what are your thoughts on the wash debate? Sure

63
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,420
well, it was interesting so I went into that debate prepared for a wide range of

64
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,180
Potential outcomes. I did not know if Vosh was gonna come out saying

65
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,700
Jordan Peterson's a Nazi and so is this guy and he was just gonna start throwing dirt from the beginning

66
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,740
That was a potentiality. So I had to mentally prepare like I

67
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,340
Gotta get ready to do that

68
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,540
You know, I've watched plenty of Vosh's videos for like years. So I knew I

69
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:27,260
Knew what he believed. Well, I knew what part of him believed. I knew what part of him professed

70
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,700
on his videos and I knew that, you know, I at his best

71
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,660
He's a very different person from who he is at his worst, right? Which, you know

72
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,260
I think you could say that you could say that for everyone, but

73
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:47,660
Brahmin when you have an online persona, I think that's amplified that spread between who you really are and the character or the persona you play

74
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,180
So

75
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,060
yeah, I you know, I didn't know how I was gonna go so I had to prepare for a wide range of outcomes and

76
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,020
I'm not gonna lie and I said this in the my reflection

77
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,180
I was very nervous in the first couple minutes. My heart was beating

78
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,020
Like to the point where I was like I might have to turn off the camera and

79
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,900
Take a lap or something because I might have a panic attack

80
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,700
Which I was interested. I knew I'd be nervous, but you know, I just I guess when you're in the moment

81
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,180
It's different and there was a strange element of you know

82
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,580
I watch Vosh again for years and I see him on the camera talking and then

83
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,540
It was kind of a weird feeling for a minute where it was like he's responding to exactly

84
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,180
I'm on the camera next to him and he's responding to what I'm saying. So it's like

85
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,220
It was it was it was you have the virtual

86
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,900
screen and then I

87
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,180
Was somehow engaged with it in a way that I wasn't before even though it was the exact same format that I consume it in

88
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,180
So it was very interesting. It was just an interesting

89
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,460
Ah

90
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,460
feeling and perception

91
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:03,140
But overall, you know, I came it my goal is I didn't know what I had to approach this whole thing carefully because on the one hand

92
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,060
One could argue

93
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,420
What's the point of even engaging with someone like Vosh, right? There's the very cynical like okay?

94
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,340
It'd be you know, I've watched him for a while and I want to argue with him about the stuff

95
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,940
He said, you know, he's got a big audience. It's nice to get that exposure. There's like those cynical reasons

96
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,860
But the the reason of like and not I don't mean cynical as in that those are non-factors. Those are just less than the

97
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,380
It's it's ultimately more than about that

98
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
You know, it's like

99
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,660
Do I

100
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,620
Come in with a bunch of quotes prepared to like

101
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,420
Pin him down and say you said these things and I can create a bunch of clippable moments of all the dumb

102
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,820
You know of of me pulling up a quote directly at contradiction with what he said like for example

103
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:54,620
I don't know how much you wash wash or the people watching watch. Oh, I you know, just just to I guess to clarify

104
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,140
I am very much on Vosh's side politically and I pretty interesting

105
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,300
I mean, I I that's so funny the way to label myself probably would be well

106
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:11,340
I probably call myself a Christian socialist, but I think really realistically. I'm a libertarian socialist

107
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,340
So

108
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
I'm very much on Vosh's side

109
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:22,340
Probably the the trans stuff and some of his I think unwarranted criticisms of

110
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:29,500
Conservatives but politically I'm very much on his side. Yeah, so you don't think that all conservatives are the equivalent of Ku Klux Klan

111
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,960
Absolutely, not mine. I can okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. You're politically

112
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:39,380
Like from a policy prescription on certain things that makes sense. I mean, I would agree with him a lot in certain policies

113
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Um

114
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:48,460
Okay, so so yeah, so you know, so you know his drama with shoe on head. Oh, yes, okay

115
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,800
Full disclosure, I didn't follow the drama. I know it was a huge thing

116
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,300
Okay, you know, but I didn't follow that bit

117
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,940
I what I normally do is when there's some one way especially given that I live in Australia and you know

118
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,500
It's hard to keep up with what's going on in in your country, man. Cuz I'm bloody hell, man

119
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:14,600
No, it's hard to keep up. It's never ending. It's never ending. What's what like, you know, it's like I think I already told you this but when America

120
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:22,700
Sneezes the whole world gets a cold. So whatever happens to America just kind of spreads across especially the Western world

121
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,540
But whenever something breaks break, let's say there's like a news item or something

122
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,740
Happens in America. I'd generally go to like Vosh. I generally go to let's say

123
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,980
David Pacman, so I'm gonna be totally up front with you. I'm very biased

124
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,940
I'm I normally go to leftist channels cuz my so interesting

125
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,420
I would not have gathered that from at least our last conversation and but but you know

126
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:52,140
It just speaks to people are different and have different perspectives and we can still I mean, it's interesting because I I

127
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,900
Don't know. It's it's a this is where I really appreciate

128
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,620
conversations like this in many many issues

129
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,420
Amagnostic, however, I'd say when it comes to politics and especially economics

130
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:13,580
I'm pretty much a socialist almost a socialist or or to put it lightly like a social democrat and part of that is probably because I live in

131
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,700
Australia where look my like over here the the political party

132
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,220
So we've got the we've got labor and the liberals so the liberals are right wing party

133
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,300
They're you know, they're quite they kind of similar prescriptions in general like no one

134
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,220
If a politician comes here and says, let's you know, let's get rid of

135
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,860
Medicare, which is a public health care service. Yep. That's no good money by the stake

136
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,700
You know that they have mandatory voting in Australia, right? Was that don't you have mandatory voting? We do. Yes

137
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,100
I'll be look some people just pay the fine. It's like a small amount

138
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,260
But I think that's a good thing. Honestly, like even though I am quite cynical about democracy

139
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:59,300
And that's just my personal prejudice. I think it's a good thing. I think I think oh Pearson talks about this that it's

140
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,740
In fact, like a civic duty for a part of country. Sure. Yeah, sorry. I don't mean to

141
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,340
Well, yeah, so this is well tight. So back to shoe on head

142
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:15,780
So for people who are not aware or kind of aware shoe on head is an online influencer. She's like a century

143
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,180
She's a Bernie. She's like a female Bernie bro in the most stereotypical sense, right?

144
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,620
She's like socialist, but she's got some I would say common sense perspectives on when it comes to culture

145
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,300
She broke or was it had a big hand in bringing the Balenciaga scandal to light

146
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:38,100
The whole thing about the the children in the photo shoot with the very questionable to questionable to put it lightly

147
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,340
That was that was

148
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,620
Right. So she brought that to light and rightfully called it out as creepy weird

149
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Yes, yeah, and

150
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,740
Of course on the far far left. There's a small minority of people who say

151
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,460
That is like somehow

152
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
bigoted to call out

153
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,020
bdsm stuff with children

154
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,260
because there's a whole history of like

155
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Queer extreme queer

156
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,300
Like kink type stuff is a form of revolutionary

157
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,220
Engagement with the world or some shit. There's some intellectual rationalization for why

158
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:22,500
Leather fetishism around children is somehow, you know, this morally sophisticated belief and shoe on head like most people said

159
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,900
Yeah, bullshit and a big chunk of the left got upset with shoe on head and a big chunk of vosh's audience got upset with shoe on head

160
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,060
So vosh came out with this whole criticism of shoe on head saying

161
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,620
basically shoe you

162
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,900
Gave fodder to far right activists to be transphobic and and bigoted and all this stuff

163
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,660
But we're still friends because they're friends in in real life

164
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,180
So what I could have done in that debate is like and I had and I was prepared to do this if it got

165
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,940
To the point where mud was being slung back and forth, but I was I was like I'm not going to go in trying to instigate that

166
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,460
I was I could you know, I could have said something effective

167
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,740
Hey, you know how you just labeled Jordan Peterson of fascist for these reasons

168
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:10,660
Explain to me right now and I would just read off a quote. You said shoe on head is literally feeding fodder to far right

169
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,220
homophobes

170
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,500
You know

171
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,980
And and feeding into conspiracy. How does that not make shoe on head a fascist?

172
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,260
But Jordan Peterson is a fascist and that you know

173
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,540
There's all the drama of a big chunk of his audience doesn't

174
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,860
Like shoe on head for the reasons we just described because they think she's doing far right reactionary stuff somehow

175
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,340
They unironically refer to shoe on head of fascist

176
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,980
so the point of all that is

177
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,380
Had it gone south I would have been prepared, but I didn't want it to go south

178
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:47,300
I wanted to bring out the best in vosh. That was my goal was let me be as honest and authentic as possible

179
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,860
say what I believe to be true and

180
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,820
ask

181
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,620
And and talk to vosh the person rather than the persona that has all these

182
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,460
ideas that are you know intellectually interesting and

183
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
questionable

184
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,020
And I wanted to get to the person so what so what ended up happening is

185
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,940
I ended up just kind of going with the flow of the conversation a bit more than I think I would have liked to on

186
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,900
On on reflection because I would have liked to hit have engaged directly with some of his

187
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,940
Critiques about for example moral anti-realism. We had that discussion about what do you mean by evil?

188
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,020
And I knew what he wanted to get into in that level of conversation

189
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,260
But I again, I was kind of interested in sticking with the well look we can have a discussion about what we mean by evil

190
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,380
But we're going to end up on this we're going to both agree that the Nazis were evil

191
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,220
So like let's just the conversation I want to have is more about why do you call conservatives?

192
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:53,060
Kkk members and do you understand how that makes people feel and stuff like that versus just engaging at the purely intellectual level of here's why I don't think

193
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,940
You know here's morality and stuff. It would have been interesting conversation though because moral realism versus moral anti-realism is interesting

194
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,500
Um, you know one thing that factored into the whole debate was

195
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,580
A lot of my friends were watching the debate live and you know, they're not people who are really interested in these topics

196
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,460
Or you know, some of them would barely even know who Jordan Peterson is or even Karl Marx or anything like that

197
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,180
So there was a part of me. That's like I all

198
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,940
I want to speak to someone who doesn't have who's not

199
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,460
Who doesn't even know what moral realism or anti-realism is right?

200
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,860
Which is most people because most people have actual jobs and lives to live and they don't have all this free time to

201
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,580
obsess about philosophy and stuff which

202
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,820
That's a that's a cynical way of looking at things oftentimes there are that what I just described is a subset of people

203
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,100
arguably philosophy is the most important thing because it you know

204
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
We're all nested in philosophy

205
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:51,300
But but when it's just like well, it's what is evil like to the average person is just like what what kind of conversation is this?

206
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,820
What do you mean? What what it's like the Nazis were evil. Can we can we just start there and move forward?

207
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,620
so

208
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,580
You know, I was sort of like let you know, let me let me have the conversation. That's more relevant here

209
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,220
Which is boss. Do you understand why calling conservatives KKK members is not good, right?

210
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,860
independent of all this intellectual stuff

211
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,060
um, so there was that the other thing I would have liked to have gone into is the cultural Marxism bit and um

212
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,100
I you know that again that would have been the same thing. We're going to go deep into the intellectual stuff and

213
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,300
You know how

214
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,020
Relevant that is for people watching. How many minds would be changed that way? I'm not sure, you know

215
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
My perspective is

216
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,060
You don't change people's minds by logic. You change people's minds by embodying um

217
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,100
authentic

218
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,260
Behavior right honest and that's what I was trying to do. I'm not coming in to dunk. I'm not coming in to

219
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,300
Beat you on the intellectual grounds. I'm coming in to articulate what my problem is with you vosh

220
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,820
And honestly and give credit where credit is due because I know because like and I've seen him give good advice

221
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,700
And he's a real person and he's not this one-dimensional

222
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,700
Troll demon as Jordan Peterson would say right so

223
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,740
and it's funny because

224
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,380
I was talking to some people

225
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:16,260
And their opinion is no vosh is like straight up evil and like he's a bad faith bad person and I was like that's so

226
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,180
Sim simplistic and you you're getting a narrow view. You're taking him it is worst, which is bad

227
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,140
and using that to to

228
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,340
Him it is worst is him all the time and and I I've just from watching him over the years

229
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,460
Know that that's not the case and it's funny because you mentioned you you said you you agree with vosh a lot. It's like

230
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,380
This is my point. I have a friend who's a big fan of vosh

231
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,260
from from college and uh

232
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:49,780
And the idea is like if you who in my opinion, I don't know you you know, well at all really but from the conversations

233
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,300
We've had more than reasonable person, you know, we could we could easily see me, you know hanging out with you and whatnot

234
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,020
Yeah, well there you go

235
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,860
I shall introduce you to something called a chicken pama

236
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,220
And you want to change melbourne specialty

237
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,580
It is it is well, I think it's an australian thing, but uh, but in melbourne, it's huge and you

238
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,180
I'm sure I'm gonna convert you fully to an australian. You're gonna you're gonna denounce you american citizens

239
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,740
Take it. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Thanks for having to keep going. My point is

240
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,060
how I

241
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,660
I don't like you are not someone who I think would

242
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,980
I like would be a fan of someone who was genuinely evil or like a genuinely bad person, right? Like if you were a fan of

243
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,700
Who's like a like david duke? You would be you would have a different personality, right?

244
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,500
This interaction would not be going the way that it is. I mean you can not to say that

245
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,140
You know far-right people can't be polite and can't hide their beliefs

246
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,780
But like, you know, it's just the nature of it

247
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,420
Like if you really believe some people were superior to others then

248
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,220
We wouldn't be having this conversation as equals almost, right? So my my that's a roundabout way of saying

249
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,780
I wanted to bring out the best I wanted to speak to the best part of vosh

250
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,620
And I wanted to bring the best part of myself and I and I was prepared to kind of

251
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,660
Go nuclear if need be

252
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,220
But that wasn't my goal and I think part of the reason the debate didn't go as

253
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,460
Didn't dig into the topics I would have liked to it's partly because it was just

254
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,740
That navigating that split the first 20 minutes. I'm like, I don't know how this is gonna go, right?

255
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,140
and when I settled in then it was kind of like well

256
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,980
We're having more it's almost like we're having more of a conversation and of an exchange and to

257
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,860
Force the cut the debate into one topic or another then becomes a little unnatural

258
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,660
And that's that's not me being as authentic as I could otherwise be

259
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,660
But now that I've established some rapport with vosh if there's an opportunity to speak again, you know, we could I would love to

260
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,140
Go into for example, like cultural Marxism specifically and just have a whole debate about that

261
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
And the last thing I'll say it's interesting

262
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,660
When it came to the trans issues I said specifically

263
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,300
Anyone watching this I'm willing to

264
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,420
Have a debate where we can pull up the studies in advance

265
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,300
Send me one quality study that demonstrates the efficacy of medical transition in children

266
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,980
There are none the reason I said I'm confident they don't exist is because I am confident

267
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,780
They don't exist and it's funny because that debate has 200,000 views or something and I know for a fact there's a lot of

268
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,580
vosh orbiters and and and people who

269
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:29,940
If those studies existed it would be glad to take me up on that debate and I've heard nothing yet so far because it doesn't exist and so

270
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,340
You know that so the the points that I wanted to make or felt were important to make were made

271
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,860
At least from my perspective so um

272
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,980
But yeah, that's that's my initial reflection and kind of on a pastor. I guess yeah

273
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,660
Well two two points. Uh, the first thing is I think

274
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,420
And I'm I'm not trying to you know, um, I mean this sincerely. I'm not trying to like uh flatter you or anything

275
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,060
Sure, I wouldn't mind if you were though, but yeah, yeah, but you know, like sometimes flattering can be insincere, right?

276
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,420
Yes, I think for the sake of saying nice things. Uh

277
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,940
I think the because you started off

278
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,980
by kind of let's say, uh

279
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,740
What would the caveat or the proviso that you in fact have

280
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,900
personally been

281
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:24,260
helped by Jordan Peterson that you in fact just leaving aside his politics just uh applying practically applying

282
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,060
let's say his his

283
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,140
uh psychological prescriptions or his self-help prescriptions have helped your life

284
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,380
That instantly built like a bridge like a human bridge between

285
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:41,540
Wash and yourself. I might want to be like, oh no, that means you both are on the same page. In fact, look, uh,

286
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,620
This is where again, you and I may disagree. I don't believe one can be a centrist. So I'll get into that a bit later

287
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,420
Okay, very theoretical. There's a very theoretical reason for that. Uh, and I get it from Slavoj Zizek

288
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,060
Who I happen to be a big fan of like I'd consider myself essentially Zizek here. Uh, yeah, um

289
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:05,940
The second point is so I I do want to give you credit for that. Um, I I'm not a big fan of debates, man

290
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,980
to be honest, I generally after a political debate

291
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:16,020
I come off feeling dispirited feeling a bit cynical feeling like both both sides were just either

292
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,660
uh, you know

293
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,060
throwing mud at each other or just purely

294
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,620
Talking past each other, but this for the first time after this debate. I I I felt good just leaving aside all the

295
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,740
Intellectual systems. I was like that was a good conversation

296
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:37,540
Like this this guy paul who is someone I like I enjoy his videos and then there's this guy wash who I

297
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,460
Watched quite a lot now and politically we aligned quite a lot and I'd like there was a dialogue going

298
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,900
and

299
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,500
Correct me if I'm wrong didn't even wash wash say that it was the end of it that he in fact appreciated the conversation

300
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,100
Yeah, yeah, the um, it's funny. I didn't know this until afterward, you know, we

301
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,780
The debate ended and then wash was still streaming on his side

302
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,220
And I found you know as soon as the debate ended. He said

303
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,180
something like

304
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,340
I actually really did enjoy talking to paul. Um, you know, he's a real guy, you know, obviously

305
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,060
And he said what you said, you know, paul said up front. He's

306
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
emotionally invested in these issues

307
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
But he wasn't lying about it, which is like

308
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,100
Uh, you know a step above all the I think he said giggling frenetic

309
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,420
Liars that he normally argues with who you know misrepresent their views and all that stuff. Um, and

310
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,620
Yeah, and it's funny. So the first to to the point about building a bridge kind of the beginning of acknowledging my biases

311
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,100
It's almost like

312
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,580
From my the bar is so fucking

313
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,460
Forgive my french. The bar is so fucking low

314
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,620
online

315
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,660
where

316
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,660
Just being honest like hey

317
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,300
The reason I spent all this time talking about topic x y and z

318
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:03,220
Is because it is personally in you know, not just interesting but impactful to me in these ways

319
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
and for me, it's like

320
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:12,580
You know, I went to therapy and so I can I made that connection explicit of the topics I talk about versus

321
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,500
Why you know how it affects how it relates to me as a person

322
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,580
But it's it seems like just second nature almost of like

323
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,500
You know that like in most political debates, well people wouldn't do that

324
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:30,660
You know, they wouldn't say out front like hey, I'm biased and and I don't know maybe certainly the online politics space

325
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,740
there's just a lot of people who are

326
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,500
probably

327
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,420
and no names or anything but

328
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,820
Probably a good chunk of them are narcissistic and only care about the money and care about the attention and could you know

329
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,300
Would just as avidly argue for one side of the political spectrum as they would another

330
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,940
And so that's I think I totally understand when it's like I watch political debate and it's just like, okay, this was pointless

331
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,100
um

332
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
but you know, I

333
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,300
I just my thought is like

334
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:07,300
Okay, if my parents or my friends or my family or if they watch my video would they think like this is a different person than

335
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,860
who paul is in real life

336
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,940
Then I've failed somehow. It's it's a form of lie, right? You know, and there's obviously nuance in like

337
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:21,940
You know, I'm not going to have a conversation exactly as I do in private as I would if I know

338
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,900
You know, 8,000 people are watching live in 200,000 people are going to see it

339
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
But for the most part, you know, if I'm

340
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,940
Careful and conscious I can have a pretty open honest conversation and

341
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:39,460
So, yeah, I think the biggest issue online and it's funny because we're in a generation where this is a challenge for us

342
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,180
that other generations haven't faced before is

343
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,060
Exactly, how do you navigate the online persona versus who you really are?

344
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
right and some people do it by

345
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,180
You know, some people say like I don't want to talk about in private life

346
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,420
Like they're academics or or or people who do like video essays who are like I'm a private person

347
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
I don't like talking about my life at all. I just like talking about the idea

348
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,220
and that's fine, but

349
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,300
that's

350
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,740
Limited I think in a significant degree because how do I know I don't know your motivations, right?

351
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,180
You're just a disembodied voice that does a video essay. I don't know anything about why you're doing it and

352
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,100
How often I think it's important when you're evaluating the merits of like a political idea

353
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,740
You need to understand the motivations of the person reporting those ideas, right?

354
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,220
So like for a mathematics, you know, someone teaching you calculus doesn't matter if they're sociopath or not

355
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,060
The math is the math what they say can translate one to one. There's no

356
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,260
Band there's no bandwidth loss because they're a bad person

357
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,060
But when it comes to like political or psych psychological or philosophical ideas, it's the opposite

358
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,060
It's like you have to it's all about

359
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,820
The character the philosophical temperament of the person putting forth the idea

360
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,100
So I'm always trying to operate at the level of

361
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,820
I am here not just on a screen talking about ideas. I'm a person

362
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,860
You know, you know real life context coming into you in this moment

363
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,860
but to to view it anything other than that I think is

364
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,100
dangerous and

365
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
uninteresting and ineffective

366
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,980
That makes sense

367
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:16,340
Now, I see what you're saying. I think I mostly agree. Um, however a part of me also

368
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,660
So you made the point previously that most people aren't interested in theory and philosophy

369
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:29,140
Uh, yes, and I happen to be one of those weird guys that just likes reading philosophy and same. Yes, me too. I've got

370
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,060
Yeah, I've got Ian McGill chris. Master is on the map

371
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,220
Right. This is most people in it perfectly intelligent people would go

372
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:46,340
That's kind of nerdy and whatever and I'm not going to take it that any particular interest in it and that's perfectly acceptable

373
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,380
That's exactly how I feel about like quantum physics, right? I'm not really that interested in theoretical physics

374
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:57,300
Maybe eventually I will be because it appears to be merging with religion and psychedelics, but you know, that's a separate thing

375
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,140
Yeah, but well, I mean, that's what comes in. Uh, so the idea of like

376
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,580
one one

377
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,580
Well, there are many definitions of philosophy

378
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:10,100
But one definition I like is what boveky points out you take all these different disciplines

379
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,140
So you be it cognitive science or quantum physics or

380
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,260
Sociology for god's sake and you try to bridge and find connections between them

381
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,300
Which is where I think an eclectic

382
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,060
kind of thinker

383
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:28,020
Okay, uh, one of my heroes zhizhek does where he connects all these different

384
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,980
His his kind of like his magnum opus

385
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,660
Let me let me get it. Sure. Uh, I I'm slowly going through it. It's

386
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,260
It's his book on hegel. Uh, it's called less than nothing

387
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,740
By zhizhek. It's just look at that. It's a big boy

388
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,020
I'm I'm still going through this and like in this book he takes

389
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,740
There's a chapter where he connects

390
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,820
a quantum physics with this hegelian idea of of

391
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,940
He calls it the incompleteness of reality

392
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,940
uh, and

393
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,140
Some people would find that bizarre because he also brings up

394
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:08,420
Uh, you know, like pop culture movies like batman and harry porter while also ringing up on a physics. So it's it's very interesting

395
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:15,700
But yeah, but then I do think and here's where maybe I sort of disagree with you, uh, paul

396
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,100
Sure is I still think it's important

397
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,580
to focus on theory because I think thinking is quite necessary and

398
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,940
what I mean, so

399
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,740
Just just to clarify that when I'm saying it's important to focus on theory. I'm not saying

400
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:39,860
Oh, that means one is indifferent to it or apathetic to it. It's impossible. You know, I I I don't think you could just be interested in theory

401
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
without in fact

402
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:49,540
Being a a a an embodied being with a life with with motivations emotions and and all the uh,

403
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,140
It's kind of like what niche has said. He you know, niche has famously said that

404
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,740
Every philosophy is the biography of the philosopher. So for niche, uh

405
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:06,580
Philosophy doesn't just exist abstractly out there, which is why he's like the proto-exception. That's like william james philosophical temperaments, right?

406
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,820
interesting

407
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:14,100
Yeah, that's that's that's you know, there are different different personalities

408
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,060
project different philosophies. So like a super

409
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,660
Left-brained to put it simply kind of like engineer type person will have a very analytic

410
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
germy bentham, uh, I think it's

411
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,660
Rationalist philosophy. It's just pure abstract and then there's the more

412
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,380
um empiricist side rationalism versus empiricism is his dichotomy where it's like

413
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,860
In the world sensory type stuff versus at the abstract. So it's different philosophical personalities temperaments

414
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,780
So that seems to line up with niche's claim that you just made. Oh, yes, certainly. And you know, here it's funny. Um

415
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,100
Heidegger in one of his lectures on Aristotle famously said

416
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,620
Uh, Aristotle was a man that was born. He

417
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Philosophized and he died. That's all that matters

418
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,780
Nothing else about Aristotle matters and and I think what heidegger was trying to do there was in fact say

419
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:09,380
Forget about getting too kind of obsessed and building this kind of cult cult persona or Aristotle or whoever just

420
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
focus on the theory just

421
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,620
That's a theory itself. Nothing more nothing less

422
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,340
um, and I the reason I say that that's still important is because

423
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,420
Okay, this is a bit hard for me to articulate, but I'm gonna try my best. So please be with me Paul

424
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,460
uh, I think we we are making a mistake in contemporary society where we

425
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,620
medicalize and

426
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,620
Psychologize everything

427
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,980
So the even even a human being is reduced to like you said a dichotomy machine. Yeah

428
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:47,620
Yeah, the left left brain or right brain and and I see the I see the temptation to do that because like, you know, I'm a soft engineer

429
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,460
That's my day job and I love I love thinking analytically

430
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,940
And I love thinking in like a very uh systematic way. Let's say

431
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,220
However, uh, the more I've I've got

432
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:05,460
Into more deeper philosophy like Lacan for instance like Lacan believes for instance that an authentic person doesn't exist

433
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
so Lacan talks about that year of uh

434
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,460
He says that the way we form our desires

435
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:18,180
Is not but is not by what we authentically won't but in fact the other he calls it the other

436
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
Tells us what to desire

437
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,220
And someone like Gizek connects that to consumerism and you know, commodity finishes him and all that

438
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:32,100
That sounds like uh, Rene Girard mimesis too, which is interesting. I'm not familiar. I mean, I I'm only just getting introduced into Girard

439
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,860
But yeah, Rene Girard mimesis m i m e s i s

440
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,700
That's the whole

441
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:42,740
All of our desires are just other desires other desires. How do I desire what other people desire?

442
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,580
How do I how do I spell that m? Rene Girard g i r

443
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:54,820
Girard, no, I go I go Rene Girard, but the yeah mimesis m i m e s i s men mimesis

444
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,860
And then gotcha. Yes. So which is different from memetic

445
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:06,260
The Richard Dawkins idea, which is m because it's there's a medic from the Girardian

446
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,180
Yeah, so there's so there's memetic from the Girardian point of view

447
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,060
Then there's memetic from the Richard Dawkins point of view, which is like the word meme came from that

448
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:23,940
Meme mimesis in the Girardian point of view is different subtle distinction, but but no, but this is this case in point

449
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,940
Here's what I mean. So what I'm trying to say is I I do think

450
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,740
It's important that the in fact

451
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,660
Sit down and think like we so so Zizek has this really good line

452
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,220
He he and Zizek is a as a communist, right? He's a leftist. He's a radical leftist and he says

453
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:45,300
Yes, you know what I would like is the day the the the revolution in before and later

454
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:50,500
What happens after the revolution, you know, that's fine with a couple for the couples in there

455
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,540
That's my terrible Zizek impression. But the point is trying to make us

456
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,300
And and and he's this is why I like him because he's as a leftist

457
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,660
He's he's challenging the left and he's asking. Hey, okay

458
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,260
The revolution's great. It's the romantic feeling. Let's overthrow the system

459
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:12,900
But what happens the day after and here's where he says theory and philosophy matters where we don't

460
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,900
We don't say that. Oh, let's just explain everything everything

461
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,180
Via psychology. Oh, let's let's let's explain everything via

462
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,660
Neuroscience or cognitive science

463
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:28,340
Let's let's sit and think and he even connects that to this idea called

464
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:35,220
I would prefer not to what what he means by that is sometimes the the greatest act of let's say, uh

465
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,140
subversion of the system is in fact not taking part in the system

466
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,220
It's saying no, I'm not going to buy that thing

467
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,180
I'm not going to buy the next generation of the iPhone or whatever and not buy not let

468
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,260
The the desire of the other affect my own desire even though

469
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,580
Again, not to get too technical

470
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,740
But like how would say that's impossible that we are always desiring like what it means to be human is in fact

471
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
You desire which I think I agree

472
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:06,740
Uh, and and now maybe uh, Paul if you don't mind I could connect this to my my point about fascism. So

473
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,620
After

474
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,620
listening to the debate for the

475
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,980
Well, I kind of got this for some but I I re-listened to it

476
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,980
Here's where I think where wash was coming from and I'm I'm kind of here thoughts

477
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,460
so

478
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,060
for for wash

479
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,020
Fascist where he defined fascism wasn't

480
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:35,300
He was being purely theoretical about it as and he wasn't trying to say a fascist is an evil person

481
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:42,500
He was he was trying to be so the the way I put it as that he was trying to get rid of the moral baggage of what fascism is

482
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,620
And he would define it as a let's say a social structure

483
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:52,900
As a theoretical social structure as a as a phenomenon in society as to how fascism comes to comes to be

484
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,700
Uh, which is why he used uh

485
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,260
Uh, umberto echoes a list which I think is a pretty good list to be honest

486
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,340
Even though I kind of come I take my definition of fascism more from hannah arendt's

487
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,100
Book because I think she is a lot more, uh

488
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,340
comprehensive

489
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,340
And then what what he was trying to say is

490
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,500
You know, we we think of and you know, you probably would agree with this because jordan pilson talks about this

491
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,780
um

492
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:25,060
You think of a fascist as some crazy, uh, you know, forgive me for being a bit racist

493
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,060
But like german-speaking ass

494
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,460
You know, this is crazy. I've been out of the consignancies, but I can wish confancies. You know, that was a pretty good

495
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:37,060
That was a pretty good. You even did that in a debate, didn't you? Yeah. Yeah. I thought you were actually speaking german

496
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:42,980
I know, I know it's pretty good. Um, yeah, and and you think that this angry guy who who looks like

497
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,900
You know

498
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,660
The devil himself

499
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,500
But no, it's in fact fascism is a a social phenomena

500
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:56,420
It's it's it's something that's rather banal in fact and all of us can can become be fascist

501
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
If we have a certain way of thinking

502
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,980
Which is why I think it's important to to study the phenomena as a sociologist should

503
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,260
And then try and lay down some kind of theory for it because if we don't have theory then

504
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:14,340
Everything we leave to the whims of let's say emotion or psychology or we or we overtly

505
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,860
Spiritualize it, which is another thing another element of fascism

506
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,860
so

507
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,220
Again, just to reiterate. I'm sorry if I'm uh, you know being a bit like questions

508
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,140
the

509
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,660
Well, I think what wash was trying to put forward is that yes, of course

510
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:34,740
He certainly hates conservatives. You could see it vehemently, but he's also trying to state that

511
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,460
hey, uh, you know

512
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,180
Fascism isn't something that was unique to the 20th century

513
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,100
It wasn't something that was just like this once in a moment thing in human history

514
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,860
It's in fact a recurring social phenomena, which we can study theoretically historically and

515
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,740
It's it's in fact rather

516
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,540
naive and dangerous to think that

517
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:01,460
Or it was those people that were the fascist. It was those crazy Germans or the crazy italians

518
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,340
It was in but the social phenomena

519
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:13,700
In the structure of society can emerge anytime and he believes and to a certain extent. I believe this too that there's a

520
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,740
There's a kind of a let's say a

521
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,660
resurrection or

522
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,340
or there's a

523
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,580
And another form of fascism that's coming into our society right now

524
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,980
You know case in point, uh, the ccp the chinese communist party. I think they're in fact a

525
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,420
I think china is very much a fascist state

526
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,460
Sure, sure. So, um, Canada seems to be going that way a little bit too

527
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,980
Well, yes, I know that he seems to be fighting a lot about that. But yeah, but you see the point, right?

528
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,020
Yes, because you think, you know, canada or liberal democracy, right?

529
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,860
But yeah, so the merge, uh, but anyway, yeah, does that make sense? Sorry. I was wrong. Yeah. No, that all makes sense

530
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,180
and it's interesting. Yes, so I so

531
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,140
Um

532
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Well, I got a couple things

533
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,100
So first off, I absolutely understand and agree

534
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,060
With the idea that fascism is not just as some mystical

535
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,100
abstract idea it it can reemerge and is reemerging in many ways

536
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,060
that

537
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,420
and maybe

538
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,420
And again, this

539
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,780
This was partly a consequence of what conversation I was trying to have

540
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,660
rather than

541
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,060
Not

542
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,260
well

543
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,260
I didn't the conversation didn't go the way that it, you know, we might have right now

544
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,940
Because it was a debate with a, you know, there was all those other factors to consider

545
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:46,020
And I was again more interested in having the meta conversation about vosh's

546
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,940
Conversation rather than on the topic itself. So what I would say is

547
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:56,660
The idea that fascism is something that could reemerge is like that's the central idea Jordan Pearson's work, right?

548
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,780
I'm gonna teach you how to that. I'm gonna teach you that you could that you would have been an Auschwitz prison guard had

549
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,580
The same circumstances, um,

550
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:09,220
Arisen in time every one of us contains within us the capacity for evil the moment you say

551
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,940
Those people are uniquely bad

552
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,940
You are now exactly the kind of person who would do bad thing, you know, the worst type of things because you have no idea how

553
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:25,300
You have you have no understanding of your own capability of evil and therefore you have no way of preventing yourself from being tempted into that

554
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,940
So I believe that

555
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,220
The and I did say this more. I think I said this

556
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,940
I said fascism means bad person

557
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,980
and

558
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:41,780
I meant in that the average person that's what that means, right?

559
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,540
Nazi means bad person to the average person, right?

560
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:49,780
Nazi just Nazi doesn't mean a national socialist person from

561
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:56,660
1940s who was interested in the 15 point Nazi plan that Hitler laid out in 1930 Nazi just means

562
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
Nazi equals bad and it's an archetype

563
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,340
Yeah, can I

564
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,340
For but that's sorry. I know you were kind of going on a point there, but yeah, no, go ahead. This is where I think

565
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,060
Vosch in fact makes a good point because

566
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,580
you know

567
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,020
the average person who thinks Nazi means bad person just

568
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:18,980
or bad bad guy or whatever is wrong and here's where theory comes in because

569
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,180
Yes, I mean, of course, Nazi is a terrible

570
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,740
I've got to say

571
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,140
It's complicated, right because it's a nuanced point because

572
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:32,260
You know, Gizek talks about this idea of uh, you know, Henry Kimmler and Goebbels

573
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:39,620
These guys plan they they architected the holocaust and at night they were listening to Wagner and Beethoven and

574
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
Yeah, they were having dinner parties and

575
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:49,540
Yeah, you know, they were living a typical bourgeois life, you know, and and you think oh, look at these sophisticated posh people

576
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,140
Haha, and they're very educated. How could they be nazis?

577
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,100
But that that is in fact why I love uh, again, hanaro and I keep I know I keep going on about her

578
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:03,140
But she is my one of my favorite political philosophers. It's that there are these structural

579
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,020
There are these structures that can give rise to fascism, which I think is what

580
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,580
Wash is more concerned about

581
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,860
And of course, he's got his own, you know personal proclivities to hate conservatives. That's a different story

582
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,900
But I think yes, and it's not even and Russia. I think his persona hates conservatives

583
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,780
I don't even I don't believe he does personally. I think he

584
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:29,540
Plays the role of someone who hates conservatives, but he certainly doesn't I bet if a conservative

585
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,820
He met on the street

586
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,620
He would not treat them the way that he would treat a kkk member

587
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,500
He met on the street

588
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,780
So I think that's a persona that he's playing and putting forward but that's

589
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,900
Separate issue we could go into that probably

590
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,540
We have a point

591
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:48,020
I mean, I've been having this thought about uh, Peterson ever since he joined daily wire to be honest that he's now becoming this

592
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,780
You know call it up conservative guy different to what he was

593
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,820
Yeah, you know prior to his fame, let's say

594
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,460
certainly yeah

595
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,460
well, so so uh

596
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,660
Because there's multiple doors open we could go to yeah, I know I know I know

597
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,260
It's just look man. This is as I said, this was not supposed to be a structure thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

598
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,900
Well, there was there was I'm trying to remember because it was one thing. I wanted to say in particular

599
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,380
but not leave evil

600
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,740
um

601
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:19,460
Okay, so the point about the average person thinks fascist equals bad, but that does is necessarily true

602
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,780
so here is where

603
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,780
and and this it's it's

604
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,180
Life is full of paradoxes and every day I realize I'm realizing that life is a paradox in and of itself

605
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,660
It's a point Zizek makes he makes the he says in this book the only universal is conflict

606
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,180
The only yes. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Perfect. Yeah, because

607
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,620
So

608
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,340
Is it true that nazi equals bad person? They're more or less synonyms. Well

609
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,540
From a pragmatist perspective

610
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:56,020
Uh, yeah, it's like saying is it is it is it true that satan equals bad? Yeah, it's like

611
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,060
Yeah, it's like well is satan bad. It's like, yes satan is bad. You know, that's how everyone uses it

612
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,380
Something says this is a satanic act

613
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,940
You know, that's bad. Yeah, but like satan was an angel, right? And there's this whole complicated like thing of like, well, there's a

614
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,580
People

615
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,420
are embodied people act in the in the in the in the day to day world and

616
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,980
What's something whether or not a whether or not a statement is true is dependent on the behavior that it

617
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,900
Uh corresponds to so like

618
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,820
And this is the whole the the reason I said the whole paradox thing is like because pragmatism is all about truth

619
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:39,860
Is a function of utility and so if people are using that language in a certain way, then it is true

620
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,940
Then then it's true in that sense

621
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,460
But like the whole nazi is bad thing. It's like nazi is equal bad. Yes, but

622
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,820
You could you have the capacity to be a nazi. So just saying

623
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:58,100
It's bad people is wrong or that bad is something outside of you and that you're not capable of partaking yourself. That's wrong

624
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,140
and

625
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,580
my

626
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:09,060
Goal and the way I approach this channel, you know, and again, this is of course the comedy channel. So I say this as a joke

627
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,100
but

628
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,420
The root of all of comedy is truth

629
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,260
um

630
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:23,220
Like sometimes certain discussions, it's just nerd shit. That's what I call it. So like for so for example, this is my favorite

631
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,220
example I give

632
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:32,020
If someone's is it an objective fact that um, you know, I'm wearing a black hoodie. Is that an objective fact?

633
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,940
well

634
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,980
To every person who is not ingrained in philosophy the answer is does

635
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,180
Right and and you even asking that question now

636
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,580
I'm suspicious of you as a person because what kind of game you trying to play

637
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,140
Yeah, what's funny is man when you said nerd shit and the moment you asked me that I was in my head

638
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,300
I was like, well, it depends. What? Well, so this is the thing. So the so the answer

639
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:58,660
Exactly. Well, and that's nerds that like philosophy and I'm in the nerd. That's what I'm in the nerd shit as well

640
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:05,300
Because you could just as easily point out and say well colors technically do not exist in the exterior world

641
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:10,580
Right colors are the experience qualia. Right the experience of seeing

642
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,540
Beaks, you know, it's like the whole your blue is my red classic thought experiment

643
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,780
And cut like and black is a bad example. We should use green. So I've got slothers of katana over there. So that's green

644
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,900
For people who are red green colorblind

645
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,700
It's actually it's like that's a very practical example of like no no no that actually isn't just green in and of itself

646
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,420
Or I don't actually know if they only see green or red or whatever how it works

647
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,500
But theoretically if you couldn't see the color

648
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,340
It's not it's not an is it an objective fact that that's green even if

649
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:43,780
There's people who do literally don't perceive it. It gets complicated. So there's nuance

650
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,980
But

651
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:53,060
Now but then but but like if if the nuance forces you to say that it's not an objective fact that this is the color red

652
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,540
It's like you're speaking in a way that doesn't

653
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,980
That you know, most people just don't

654
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:05,700
Can't get can't even understand or get behind right and so the whole when I was saying like nazi, you know

655
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:10,420
Nazi equals bad person fashion equal bad person. I was sort of approaching it from that perspective. It's like

656
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,140
Yes, I'm aware there's nuance here

657
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,140
But the conversation that I'm trying to have

658
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,860
Is one that we can start with

659
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:25,620
Like whatever our definition of bad is we're going to come to an agreement that nazis are bad or at least doing nazi things

660
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:30,900
Are bad nazi activity is bad activity, right? Whether they're bad people it gets nuanced but

661
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:37,060
Doing things that nazis do is the same as doing bad things and it's not that it's not as simple as that

662
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:43,860
But because again vosh has a big audience and when you get to the mass media perspective

663
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,740
I would say the simpler new the simpler

664
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,020
way of thinking about things is actually the more

665
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:57,460
Relevant way of thinking about things because that's how most people interpret it. Again, you know, what most of his audience is probably like 15 16 year olds

666
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,100
You know, they probably don't know

667
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,020
the you know

668
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,940
Not that I know anything but like they don't they're not approaching these issues from a

669
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,380
philosophically interesting like okay, how can we separate it's just like

670
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:14,180
You know, uh, the the conservative kid at my school who's bullying me as an asshole

671
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:20,740
And so this guy reinforces my perspective and you can switch that around to the conservative side where oh these liberal pretentious assholes are

672
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,180
You know and now this considers guys telling me why all my liberal pretentious friends are asshole

673
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,460
So I like it, right?

674
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,780
That's the that's the plane that is more relevant because if society collapses

675
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,220
It will be at that level of analysis

676
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,380
It will be at that level of conversation that failed that will cause society to fall apart

677
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:43,060
It's not but we didn't properly articulate the differences between the objective reality and subjective reality. It's

678
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,300
nazi's bad

679
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,900
communist bad

680
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:52,340
And we need to be able to from people like me whose fundamental goal is i'm trying to avoid

681
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,060
The end of the world. That's one of my many fundamental goals. Let's prevent society

682
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,300
For a comedian. It's a laudable goal for exactly. Yes, right?

683
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,740
And i'm doing it through and and and and to that point it's kind of like

684
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,660
I need the theory is correct and I and this is like conversations

685
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:13,060
You and I are having our sort of you know my bread and butter and that's what I live for

686
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,620
That I want to engage at this level, but when it comes to

687
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,620
how do I

688
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,620
go from this abstract conversation to

689
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,020
How do I communicate this to someone who

690
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,660
You know has to work all day

691
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:30,660
To support a family and doesn't have time for all the stuff that i'm fortunate enough that I have time to dig into these books and all that stuff

692
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:35,540
Right, and that's the approach I take on things for what it's worth. So that whole thing is a

693
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,660
I don't know we compassed a lot there. No, no, no, that was perfect

694
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:45,540
I think this is exactly what I was trying to get from me Paul as in certainly like a manipulative way

695
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,540
What I was trying to

696
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:52,100
I already for I just say because I think I get it now you see

697
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,980
I'm going to be told you are front with you here

698
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,620
This is

699
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:01,140
The goal of my channel is not I don't care about saving the world. I don't care

700
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,980
But even doing I care about doing good, of course, like to a certain extent as a christian. Why not?

701
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,580
But but it's I'm purely interested in theory

702
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:14,660
Like I want I want to move my channel to its philosophy and theory and then my other love which is computer science

703
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,260
so

704
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,380
So now but but I can see and correct me if I'm wrong here, please

705
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,580
Your goal isn't pure purely to talk about

706
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,460
Juck that it does

707
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,700
So oh episteme and then go on or even jordan peterson's about that, right?

708
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:35,860
Like I will do heavy theory videos, right that are like, you know, we're I'm pulling from

709
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,580
directly from a george leikoff

710
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,660
Neuroscience lecture

711
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,380
So I do do that, but all of that is in the context of

712
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,260
utility like I'm

713
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,260
I'm pulling all this theory for the purpose of

714
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:55,380
Making a moral prescription maybe okay, okay, or at least even if that's not if I don't explicitly make that claim

715
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,500
which in those videos I often do but sometimes I won't but like

716
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:04,500
There is an element of it always comes back to how does this why is this relevant, right?

717
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,540
Versus sort of the it sounds like correct me if I'm wrong you have sort of an aesthetic appreciation of

718
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,260
The ideas and the theory themselves

719
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:16,900
There's just some it's like art where it's like there's something in and of itself that speaks to you

720
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,940
I'm not a pragmatist certainly

721
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:24,340
What's that? I'm not a pragmatist. I don't do things for pragmatic. I do right, right?

722
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:29,860
You put it perfectly aesthetic appreciation like I love and I yeah, and I again go back to paradoxes like

723
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,500
I'm not saying that that I don't have that

724
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,060
That's not like I love

725
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:40,740
Movies and I love like like Star Wars universe and fantasy type worlds and stuff like that

726
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,100
And obviously there's a huge aesthetic component of that certainly

727
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,100
but but the way but for me the the aesthetics

728
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:53,460
Are also a function of utility in some sense where it's like like I take the evolutionary perspective where

729
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:59,460
You know like you see a sunset, right? And we know from like a scientific perspective that

730
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,740
the the a sunset in particular

731
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,780
evokes a certain emotional response

732
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:12,740
That like fosters cohesion and stuff it like puts you in like a like a meta like a relaxed state of peace

733
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:18,020
And it's a you know, you can be a reductivist and say visual stimuli emotional states

734
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,100
and

735
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,580
So the aesthetic is a serving a very functional purpose

736
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,220
but I kind of turn around the head where it's like it's not like

737
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,940
it's not like

738
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:35,460
The aesthetic is still fundamental where it's like this emotional response is not just like oh, it's just for survival

739
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,980
it's like no, no, no, it's

740
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:40,420
It's it's putting yourself in contact with the metaphysical

741
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,540
foundation of reality, right? What is that sunset?

742
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,980
Represent or what is that sunset?

743
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,140
you know, I'm and I'm

744
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,420
thinking I'm

745
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:55,380
Falling apart here because it gets so complicated. I mean, yeah, but but but but

746
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,620
But

747
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:04,660
For me because of I feel like I've always been more on the how does this relate to the thing in front?

748
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,660
I hated philosophy

749
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,780
Up until about

750
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:16,740
Freshman sophomore year of college in part because I had friends who studied philosophy

751
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:22,820
Who were just intellectual masturbators who would just string together those? I told you well, no, you're not because you know

752
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:28,340
Well, at least at least you're not to the degree that okay, okay some of them were because

753
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,340
It was it was literally like

754
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,700
um

755
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,900
poetry

756
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:40,420
Where I would say something like what is it to be in relationship to the object of our desire and that

757
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,300
the metaphysical reality of this that and it was like

758
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,900
It wasn't that you were saying anything. It was the

759
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:53,300
It was the act of putting together these complicated words in with some rhythm and some poet and like, you know

760
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,020
And that can be interesting from like a you know

761
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,980
Poetry without explicitly saying anything is still interesting

762
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:05,860
But that's all that's all that it was like it wasn't helpful like like philosophy wasn't when I first encountered it in the way that I encountered it

763
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,700
It wasn't being used

764
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:14,100
To elucidate anything. It wasn't being used to improve your life. It was just hear all these abstract concepts

765
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,860
I remember saying to my friend like

766
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:20,020
It is such a privileged arrogant thing to be able to sit back and say

767
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:26,100
What is the relationship between me and my consciousness and the objects around me? It's like dude, there are people starving

768
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,820
There's the shit we have to do this is a waste of time

769
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,540
and and now

770
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,340
The reason I'm interested in philosophy is because in order to be able to to do those things

771
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,140
You know people are starving. Let's go address that there's shit to do

772
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,140
You have to like you have to get to you have to do philosophy to

773
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,580
Put yourself in the best position to be able to solve problems

774
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,980
So that's where I'm coming from

775
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,100
And you you know, it's a blend of both but it sounds like you

776
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:56,340
Maybe are also on the like there's just something about the aesthetics of it

777
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:02,740
Of you know being like being with a capital B. I remember first understanding that phrase was like oh, that's cool

778
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,740
like you know independent of

779
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:08,900
This didn't help me solve a problem or anything but like oh oh being with a capital B is

780
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:15,220
Read there's reality as it manifests in front of me, but then there's reality as I experience it and there's

781
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,940
you know, that that's an important distinction, but like

782
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,740
Some there's something about that distinction that speaks to you that that's aesthetic

783
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,540
I guess to some degree and so I value that as as well, but

784
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,460
Yeah, because you know in a way Paul and

785
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:34,820
Forgive me if this comes to the wrong way. You're kind of trying to do an impossible thing

786
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:40,820
Because it could be unfair to say or all you like if if if someone says

787
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:45,300
Pf young your channel is a self-help channel. I mean, that's besides not a self-help channel

788
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:50,260
No, it's not just because you you talk about you in fact do talk about metaphysics and theory

789
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:55,060
You talk about archetype psychology all of that and that is very much I believe

790
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,540
Grounded in your aesthetic appreciation of these concepts

791
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:05,540
Though yes, you also try and build a bridge. I don't know if that's a proper word, but you try and

792
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,700
See how that can

793
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,780
Have a material impact on the world

794
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,420
Um, and I think all philosophers do that for instance again one of my my hero Gizek

795
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,140
He'll take Hegel's metaphysics or

796
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,460
Or Hegel's lack of metaphysics different conversation and then Lacan's

797
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,180
you know psychoanalysis and then he

798
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:31,540
Takes a Marxist perspective and he connects them and he he finds a synthesis into the real world where there's political action and whatnot

799
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,140
so

800
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,140
And and that's that's where

801
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:42,100
Maybe now we could connect this back to the the fascism bit where I kind of want to maybe I want to make it like an episode in this

802
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,180
in this uh conversation so that I can

803
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:45,780
kind of

804
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,140
You know, uh have it as like one one flow. Let's say

805
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,980
um

806
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,420
It's that so Gizek was asked in one interview

807
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,060
What's the purpose of philosophy?

808
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,580
and he said oh, it's a difficult question to answer but but

809
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,620
generally

810
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:09,540
philosophy comes to salience in times of crisis because philosophy isn't about giving solutions

811
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,380
It's in fact

812
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:18,100
Learning even how to formulate the questions. It's not even about giving the answers. It's about it's about figuring out figuring out

813
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,580
What questions to ask in the first place?

814
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:26,180
That's I like that, you know, and I I certainly at a very pragmatic level. I agree with him there

815
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,260
I I think philosophy isn't even about

816
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:34,500
Going and finding solutions that can be done in different disciplines like like science of course or economics

817
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:40,500
There are many other disciplines where we could focus on on on solutions on palpable material solutions

818
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,940
But that is on philosophy, you know, and I think philosophy is the questions, which is why

819
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,140
Perhaps we could connect that to the uh

820
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,260
the fascism part where

821
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,820
okay, so

822
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:00,500
There are there are two two thinkers here. There's there's hannah arwin and then there's uh,

823
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:06,500
I keep forgetting the guy's name um burto echo and burto echo his list so

824
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:14,580
When when wash wash colds, uh pizza fascist, uh, here he is

825
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:21,380
Is it okay if you go there now to to like kind of? Yeah. Yeah a bit. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so just for the vivas

826
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,180
I'll put up the list on the screen. Uh, but

827
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,340
I'll I'll first read it out. Um, you could even if you it's up to you

828
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,940
You could share it with me now. So we're both looking at it. But that's the right. Yeah, but you know, if you don't want to have us be minimized

829
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:40,100
It's not that's the right idea. Uh, we can both then refer to the same point that could work the problem with being a nerd is man

830
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,100
I've got multiple screens and

831
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,020
I

832
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:48,420
Yeah, I'm doing like a bath the app spot. Yeah, so let me zoom in

833
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:53,060
So this is from open culture. I just found this list, but you could find it like on Wikipedia wherever

834
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:54,740
um

835
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,580
And we could probably discuss this and then if if it's okay with you

836
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:03,140
There's also a small excerpt from hannah arwin's book that I'd like to read out

837
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:09,940
Yeah, so this is the list in fact that borsch was referring to and I think this is a pretty good list to define a fascist from a

838
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,620
theoretical perspective

839
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,180
So, uh, there are 14 points here. Uh, I'm just going to firstly

840
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,780
Go through

841
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,780
Read out all 14. Uh

842
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,900
The cult of tradition the rejection of modernism

843
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:26,900
Modernism, sorry the cut of action for action's sake

844
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,100
Disagreement in treason

845
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,260
fear of difference

846
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,260
Appeal to social frustration

847
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,900
The obsession with the plot

848
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,780
The enemy is both strong and weak

849
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,820
pacifism is trafficking with the enemy

850
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,540
contempt for the weak

851
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,340
Everybody is educated to become a hero

852
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,420
uh

853
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,700
What's that word?

854
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,700
machismo machismo and weaponry

855
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:54,980
uh

856
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,980
selective populism

857
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,980
Irv fascism speaks new speak. So it's like an o'whalien thing new speak

858
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:07,060
So firstly paul, let me just ask you up front from this these 14 points

859
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:12,660
If you were to give the devil his deal, let's say in this case the devil is borsch

860
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,700
borsch, uh

861
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:20,980
Would you say is that is that a connection you can make to to any of peterson's work?

862
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:24,340
His persona even his twitter whatever he does publicly

863
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,980
From these 14 points

864
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:31,060
Yes, so I was I was looking over this, um

865
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,820
Prior to this conversation and what stood out to me is

866
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,060
A

867
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,380
Lot of these points

868
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:44,740
Are not just the descriptions of fascism, but the description of

869
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,580
tyranny in general or authoritarianism, right?

870
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,220
Now it's funny because

871
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:55,540
Uh, I think vosh has claimed like Stalin was a fascist

872
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:04,260
Right, so that to to my point it's like everyone who's a thought my own Stalin nazis

873
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,660
fascism

874
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:11,940
What we normally think of is like kind of, you know, the nazis equal fascist fascist is like a right-wing thing

875
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,340
and i'm pretty sure there's a lot of

876
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,860
Thinkers that would say that fascism is a right-wing phenomenon

877
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:24,340
Um, I think marcus. That's like his central idea his list. Yes a dono's list. Yeah, it's a right-wing phenomenon

878
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,420
Yeah, yeah, it's inherently right-wing

879
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,460
Um, which means Stalin was right-wing even though he called himself a communist so we get we immediately get into the realm of

880
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:39,380
Depending on how you define fact if fascism just means like you said ccp is fascist. It's like well, they're communist

881
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,580
but

882
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,140
I get your point if if we're going to define fascism in the way

883
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,940
Yeah

884
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,340
Yeah, so, um

885
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,860
Like cult of tradition

886
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:56,660
One only has to look at the syllabus of every fascist move to find major traditionalist thinkers

887
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:01,700
The nazi nazis was nourished by traditionalist syncretasist the cult elements

888
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,420
so

889
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,020
It's kind of like a matter of interpretation

890
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:10,980
And so is anyone who appreciates tradition at risk of are they somewhat fascist?

891
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:16,740
So if I if I have a minor appreciation for tradition if I get married and my wife takes my last name

892
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,380
For no other reason than its tradition

893
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,420
Is that am I semi-fascist in that regard?

894
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,820
Uh

895
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:31,300
I hope you know, well, I hope that's not well. I don't know if that's what vosh was say given that we're talking about

896
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,900
You know his because he brought up the the the

897
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,220
It's the reason we're having this conversation is because of him. So I'm going to refer to him. Yeah, but a lot

898
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:47,780
But well, here's where I I think of peterson as falling into some maybe let's take the color tradition, right? So

899
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,260
Partially from my understanding

900
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,980
I haven't got much of an understanding

901
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,500
Or like the details of this list by umberto echo

902
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,580
But hannah aaron certainly talks about this color tradition idea where she says

903
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,300
so, you know, uh

904
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:07,780
peterson says

905
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:11,460
The the west is in crisis from the postmodern new maxis. So

906
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:16,740
Or from these radical leftists or from woke people the west is in crisis

907
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:21,300
Where we are going through a downfall in our civilization

908
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,300
and

909
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,980
and the idea is

910
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,220
the the color tradition the way I read it is that

911
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,820
we have all these crazy people that are

912
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,860
creating havoc and chaos in society

913
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:39,460
We need to go back to something of more more ordered something more of a conservative

914
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,820
Way where there was hierarchy and structure where

915
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:48,740
Men knew men knew what men were women knew what women were everybody had a place a role and for me

916
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:52,740
That's fascist when the moment we start prescribing on how

917
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,020
individuals should should fit into

918
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,820
a certain

919
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:04,260
Let's say we prescribe how people should live their lives within broader society and we we say

920
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,100
Uh, you have a place. So, you know, it's it's funny. Uh

921
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:15,780
Nature who's a proto postmodernist in fact believed in hierarchy. He said that everybody has a place

922
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:22,980
There are the the masters and slaves. There are some people remember that yeah, we're much exactly some people fit in the hierarchy

923
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:28,180
And and which the irony there is of course that uh, he was a

924
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:34,820
Postmodernist they didn't believe in any any objective morality. Not none of that. He he didn't even he believed that we should reject

925
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:43,380
Tradition but he called Christianity slave morality. Exactly. And he he said he believes that Christianity was the worst thing that happened to the west

926
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,740
Which I women to disagree with him on but

927
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,220
Anyway, sorry, I'm going all over the place here

928
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:54,180
The idea of for me the cut of tradition is where to put it very very plainly

929
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:57,460
When people say all the good old days the good old days where

930
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:03,620
You know, where you know, where there was monogamy where there was, you know, men and women got married where you know

931
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:07,540
People all over the church, uh, everybody knew their place in society

932
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:12,100
But now we live in this chaotic times. Firstly, I don't think the good old days existed ever

933
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:15,620
There has never been the good old days in my opinion. I think in in some sense

934
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:20,260
I'm here very much as Jackie and where the only universalist is conflict

935
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:24,500
Society is forever going through this antagonism. Let's say

936
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,820
uh, but when

937
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:32,820
Yeah, when Peterson does those kinds of prescriptions, I do think I'm not gonna that's for me. That's not fascism

938
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,900
But I think there are elements of fascism that can come through him saying

939
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:39,540
People should find their place in society

940
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:44,660
If that makes well, so okay, so that we can have a whole interesting conversation on that point, I think because

941
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,460
I

942
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,460
so

943
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:55,780
I'm not sure what the difference between you said like you said prescribing people

944
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:02,100
Prescribing, you know, what people how people should live their life in a social hierarchy, correct

945
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:08,820
Yeah, perhaps we're describing their place in that society. Yeah, that's probably a bit of if putting

946
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:15,380
So, okay, so let me complicate that because I would say for example children obey their parents. Is that fascistic?

947
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:18,020
Well, to a certain extent, I would say yes

948
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:24,020
I mean, this is where this is where things get a bit iffy and you know, we go on the nerd theory shit

949
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,900
Right, which is fine. I'm had let's we're here for that. This is not

950
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:32,660
Because this is like 200,000 people will not see this. So, you know, it's not about appealing to the masses

951
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:37,700
It's about not at all man. Like I just want to purely speak about theory today if you don't mind and I know you

952
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:43,380
Well, so I don't I don't feel guilty for doing so. No, totally. Totally. Okay. So to that point to that point

953
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:49,220
You know children obey their parents is you know, it's it's it's at least in this regard. There's some element of

954
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,100
fascist fascism to it

955
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:54,420
and it's like, okay

956
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:56,180
then

957
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,180
This is where

958
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:03,060
This is where, you know, equivocation aside because we're not having a debate and it's not too a thing

959
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,820
Then fascism isn't a bad thing

960
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,700
if that's the case

961
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:12,020
or at least like or at least

962
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:19,300
The lack of fascism is a bad thing because if if if children should obey their parents

963
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,940
is

964
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:27,300
Fascistic like there's no society that's ever existed that isn't at least somewhat fascistic because every society

965
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:30,900
children obey their parents, you know, it differs what age and all that stuff, but

966
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:36,100
And in christianity too, right christianity is like there's a whole honor your mother and father

967
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:41,620
Yeah, submission is a big part of christianity. Yes. Yeah. So I guess how do you think about like

968
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,740
Do you think fascist fascism is bad?

969
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,060
And that's just so this that's too simple the question obviously, but I guess

970
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,500
Even if we're just talking about intellectually

971
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:56,420
You know as fascism purely descriptive or or is there some

972
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:01,860
You know, it's it's there's an implication that it's a negative thing, right? That's that's a good point

973
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:08,980
I would say intellectually and here's where I'm very much going back into philosophy. It is purely descriptive

974
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:14,420
Whereas the prescriptive element. Okay. I would say okay. Hannah Arendt's different. She certainly

975
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:20,900
Makes moral claims in the book like in in origins of totalitarianism. She certainly makes moral claims and

976
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:26,180
and for good reason given that she was a jew in germany and she

977
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,740
was exiled

978
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:35,300
When the nazis came into power. So she has a she has a right to make moral claims, but as as

979
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,780
at an intellectual level, I would say

980
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:44,500
It has that kind of here's where I think the descriptive element matters because

981
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:52,340
Uh, the descriptor a list like this theory, let's say is in some sense the canary in the coal mine

982
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:57,940
It's an harbinger of what's to come. It's a it's a way of of analyzing and making sense of reality

983
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:02,260
via a a theoretical framework therefore

984
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:04,740
you know, if if

985
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:10,900
For example, if I say yes, you know, forcing children to listen to their parents even though

986
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,580
Look, I'm not a I'm not a father yet. I'd like to be one

987
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:21,300
I would certainly warn my kids to to listen to me to a certain extent, you know, not all that much, but sure

988
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,700
Definitely not completely. Yeah, if there's

989
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:28,660
That's bad. Yeah, yeah, because then it then it, you know, they kind of become like

990
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,700
Cox

991
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:33,780
to you the technical tell

992
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:36,100
Yes, the technical to the theory

993
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:42,500
You got to be able to sometimes break the rules a little bit. Uh, uh, yeah. Yeah, and and I don't know so

994
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:46,820
If I could connect this to something a bit more tangible, let's say we're we're getting

995
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:51,300
Way way too abstract here and I apologize. It's my nature. I can't help myself

996
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:56,100
You know, Peterson always talks about cleaning your room, you know, personal responsibility

997
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:03,380
Look, look, look what burdens of the world you want to take upon and and live in life and and so it's it's it seems as if

998
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,100
It seems as if from his

999
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,100
rhetoric there's very little

1000
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,740
uh

1001
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:13,060
Let's say dialogue a conversation about in fact

1002
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:19,380
No, not focusing on myself not focusing on on what I can do within the structure of society

1003
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:25,940
But what about changing the structure of society itself? What about challenging these hierarchies itself?

1004
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:33,300
Because for me, that's essentially what leftism is left leftism is it's it's quite simple. It's it's simply wanting to

1005
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:35,220
uh

1006
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,220
To challenge the existing

1007
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:44,180
Social hierarchies or to a certain extent abolishing them even though that's perhaps an impossible impossibility

1008
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:50,260
Yes, I would say likely an impossibility. Yeah, nonetheless. It's it's still challenge. It's this constant challenge of existing

1009
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,660
structures and social hierarchies

1010
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:58,420
Yeah, making hierarchies more equal or stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1011
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,460
So, okay on that point in particular

1012
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,460
Well, first off, I would say

1013
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,300
Uh

1014
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,940
A thorough reading of Peterson. I don't I think would

1015
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:12,980
What's the word?

1016
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:16,020
I think would absolve not absolve. I think would

1017
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:20,900
Banish that idea that you just put forward from your head. Sure because one

1018
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:26,260
Yeah, yeah, it's a peter sony and meme almost where his phrase is

1019
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:31,300
You need to do what's good for you. What's good for your family? What's good for the society?

1020
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:35,220
What's good for your community? What's good for society, right? That's that's the p. That's the

1021
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,900
I believe that's the highest form of piagetian

1022
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:40,900
Moral

1023
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,660
It's a character. Oh

1024
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,660
no, no, no

1025
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:47,220
Piaget is concerned with moral development, right?

1026
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:52,100
Like first you play first you can like play play with another child without having explicit rules

1027
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,500
Then you can play a game with explicit rules

1028
01:11:55,140 --> 01:12:02,660
And then the final stage the highest order of moral development for human beings is being able to generate new rules to new games

1029
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,940
and another that's

1030
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,900
The a consequence of that is

1031
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,940
Human beings can act in ways that are good for themselves

1032
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,820
and also good for their families

1033
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:21,380
And also good for their communities and also and it just expands, right?

1034
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:28,340
There's and and the the fundamental peter sony and claim is like your brain is wired to tell you when you're doing that

1035
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:32,820
when you are most deeply meaningfully engaged with something whether it's pursuing art or

1036
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:38,180
You know creating some code that's useful or doing whatever when you're develop when you're developing yourself to the point

1037
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:42,740
Where you can become the kind of person that's as good for yourself and society as you can be

1038
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:48,580
You're adapted to that and so the whole idea of like hey the reason that you pursue

1039
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,620
personal responsibility the reason that you clean your room

1040
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:57,460
Is so that you put yourself in the position to be able to make those broad social changes, right?

1041
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:01,140
because you need politicians you need people that do that, you know

1042
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,820
that

1043
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,820
you know, like he's a fan of Tolstoy and

1044
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:07,700
Martin Luther King and Gandhi and all that, right? It's like

1045
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:12,020
That was clearly all social action. You know collective action

1046
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:16,180
And again, and this is funny your point about centrism. I don't know if we'll uh

1047
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:21,700
Time to go over, you know, we could we I'm more than happy to do a separate thing just on centrism. That would be really interesting

1048
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,860
Yeah, I mean, I have

1049
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,620
Theoretical reasons as to why I sure sure I'm as impossible, uh, but

1050
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:34,420
Nonetheless, sorry to interrupt sure. Well, just to preview what my at least argument would be or my perspective is is that

1051
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:38,580
The best elements of leftism and the best elements of conservatism

1052
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:44,420
Are encapsulated in centrism and it's just a matter of adapting to the circumstance. So for example leftism as you said

1053
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,780
it's about

1054
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,900
equalizing hierarchies and addressing corrupt social structures. It's like

1055
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:56,580
There you and Peterson's whole point is the whole reason there are people with personalities that we would describe as liberal

1056
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:58,660
Is because that's a necessary function

1057
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:04,980
You need people who can who when society is getting corrupt, which it always does because it always leads towards corruption

1058
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:12,260
And and the world is constantly changing new technology is created and the laws that you had in the past aren't going to apply

1059
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:18,340
Like, you know with like ai for example, we that clearly needs to be regulated, right or or anything the internet, you know

1060
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:25,700
Like free speech like, you know, we still don't allow child abuse to be videotaped and distributed

1061
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:31,860
Like that's not even a remotely contentious philosophical. Well for some people it might be a remotely just philosophically contentious at you

1062
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:34,580
but for most people it's not and rightfully so and so

1063
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:41,700
Um, why did I even bring that up? So so you need people on the on the left who can say hey

1064
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:49,860
These these traditions and these rules if they can't just be they have to be interpreted to the modern environment that we're in

1065
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:53,220
And the the process of that interpretation is inherently left-wing

1066
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,620
Well, well there

1067
01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:02,020
Right and then the conservative flip side would be like hey, I know that you guys want to change all this shit

1068
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:06,660
But we've been doing this shit for 2000 years and it turns out that all of these changes

1069
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:12,900
um didn't consider why we were doing things for 2000 years to begin with right like

1070
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:18,260
um a good example is like this like the sexual revolution, you know, the

1071
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:23,700
You know in the victorian times people were super prude and repressor sexual. Well, you know, it was clearly unhealthy

1072
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:29,380
Okay, so what was the flip side of that the sexual revolution the 60s and all that well, okay

1073
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:36,500
You know, there's clear benefits to that people are freer and you know, it's not constrictive and you know people can in principle

1074
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:41,140
You know get compatibility with partners before they get married and stuff. There's all kinds of good reasons

1075
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:42,900
I think you can make

1076
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:47,060
But what's the flip side of that? Well, you know how much sexual assault occurred at woodstock

1077
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:51,940
You know how much sexual assault occurred in the sexual liberation where oh, we were just we're just liberated. It's like

1078
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:57,140
Consent was not nearly as emphasized during the sexual revolution and it's funny because

1079
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:00,500
the current sort of left-wing perspective on

1080
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:03,380
Uh like consent and all that

1081
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:07,540
It's sort of doubling back to the conservative part where it's like you need you need, you know, it's very

1082
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:12,980
You know no room for or you know, what is it? Uh for messing around you need you need

1083
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:18,340
You know strict verbal consent on every every move you make yeah, it's it's pathetic

1084
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:22,420
I mean, I mean anyone who's been with uh, well because I'm straight. I'm gonna be with a woman

1085
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:27,060
I don't think anyone's gonna go and be like before you make out with the girl. Hey, could you sign this specific?

1086
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:33,780
Yeah, exactly. Well, dude, there's black. There's black mirror episode about like someone like can you sign off all the consent forms of

1087
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:37,540
All the things we're about to do whatever it's like something that'd be great sex, right? Yeah, imagine that. Yeah, exactly

1088
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:40,580
Yeah, that's all the that's all the mystery. Yeah, that's a foreplay

1089
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,820
Risk

1090
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,780
So so the whole point of that is to say

1091
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:49,380
The left is needed half the time or

1092
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:53,460
For half of the problems and the conservatives are needed for the other half of the problems

1093
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:57,220
And you have to adjudicate between both because the environment is shifting around you

1094
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,620
and so

1095
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:05,300
I I'm not I don't buy the idea that peterson is an anti leftist in its most positive form

1096
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:12,100
He's obviously anti extreme leftist just as he is extreme against extreme right wing to tell terrarism, right? I mean, he's whole

1097
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:16,580
analysis of Nazi Germany and his old thesis is like

1098
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:21,700
This shit was bad and I'm trying to you know get everyone to understand how bad it was and how

1099
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:29,220
You could have easily played a part in bringing about that terrible situation and why it's important to understand that so that we don't bring that about

1100
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:35,220
Yeah, okay. So here's here's a follow-up question. Um, I I think I

1101
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:40,020
Mostly agree with what you said, but then and forgive me for name dropping

1102
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:43,860
But I've got to do this because I'm a nerd. Uh, so, you know, if you ask someone like

1103
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,540
Like uh, like data, let's say uh

1104
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:53,540
What do you mean by okay, you ask from them, uh, it is truth objective

1105
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,420
Perhaps what data would say is, you know, we got a question the question itself

1106
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:02,740
He'll speak about the episteme where can we even to even have that question

1107
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:07,300
What structures do we have to ask that question? Like that's how dirty. Yeah, which is funny

1108
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:13,300
The question the question exactly. Yeah, there's a clip of Peterson doing that exact thing where it's like, well, what do you mean by god?

1109
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:16,100
What do you mean by you? What do you mean by god?

1110
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:20,180
So that's funny because it's it's he does the same thing in some and I think it's you know, you know

1111
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:25,380
In a certain to a certain extent, I like that Peterson does that. Yeah. Well, I don't know what I mean if the devil is do

1112
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:30,100
Yeah, of course. Yeah, what yeah, yeah, who knows what what do you mean by god? It's it's difficult

1113
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,220
It's it's perhaps the question what right?

1114
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:34,820
so

1115
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,820
the the way I would

1116
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:40,100
connect that to this first point the cut of tradition is

1117
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:45,220
So you said there are there are there are people in the left people people in the right

1118
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:50,580
and we're trying to find the best of both worlds and kind of create this kind of synthesis

1119
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:53,060
um, and

1120
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:56,500
And then maybe come to a higher truth or a better way of life something

1121
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:01,780
Beyond something. Yeah, let's even say morally better than what we have right now

1122
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,100
but

1123
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,300
what if

1124
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:10,580
There can't be a synthesis. What if in fact there is this inherent conflict

1125
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:16,980
Um between what right wing people believe or left left wing people believe so kissing point is

1126
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:21,940
to connect it to the gender issue, uh, which you and wash went into deeply

1127
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,700
what if

1128
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:25,380
fundamentally

1129
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:30,740
The people in the left or or people let's say in the in the in the far left or the walk moment

1130
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:34,820
Had a different idea of what gender is to

1131
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:40,420
Conservatives like a person. I'm sorry to say this but I I'm gonna say I fucking hate matt walsh

1132
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:46,180
Uh, he he really just angered me. He's a fascist. He's someone that I would describe as fascistic

1133
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:50,180
I mean, you saw his proto fascist about killing drug drug dealers

1134
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:58,580
He he tweeted beautiful airport in singapore and he was like we would have an airport like this if we kill people who smoke weed or something

1135
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:00,500
so, uh

1136
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:05,700
Yeah, I think like for example, he would easily fit into most points on this list easily

1137
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:10,820
We wouldn't even even have to have this conversation calls himself a fascist democratic fascist. So yeah, exactly

1138
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:15,220
And it's like ha ha it's a joke. It's like, yeah. Well root of all jokes. Yeah. I mean, correct

1139
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,020
Right. I mean, he's got a million followers. I don't think you know

1140
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:22,180
I disagree with that kind of cynical thing where people say, oh, everything's a joke. No, man

1141
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:28,980
Sometimes the things you say recently. I don't know if you were familiar this. Uh, oh wash in fact covered this but that's 16 year old

1142
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:35,060
Uh transgender girl. She was she was murdered in high school. Yeah, Brianna in England, right in england

1143
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:38,500
I mean, so no no no sometimes not everything is a joke and sometimes

1144
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:46,660
You what you're trying to do is very much warranted and needed where yeah, you do try to take these theoretical concepts and

1145
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:53,540
Connect them to real life because there are real material impacts. Sorry. I'm going off on a tangent here. No, no

1146
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:59,700
What I'm trying to make is so my question is what if there is that inherent conflict? What what do we do there?

1147
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,700
Well, we for well fair enough

1148
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:10,260
I think I'd say we first identify is that conflict because it's inherent or is the conflict because of breakdown of communication

1149
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,660
So like you gave the example of

1150
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:13,860
Well, go ahead

1151
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:19,300
Well, no, I would I would say at a very conceptual level. It is just fundamentally inherent. So, uh,

1152
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:24,100
I mean communication is a complicated topic. But like for for example, if

1153
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:27,780
a, uh, let's say a leftist believes that

1154
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:33,940
Gender is a a social phenomena. So, you know, speaking about people like Judith Butler

1155
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:41,220
It's it's performativity where where what gender is is a performance or it's it's how we view ourselves in the

1156
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:46,340
Gaze or the perspective of the other that society let's say for all the innocent purposes

1157
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:52,420
Whereas a person on the right would say no gender is it's it's rooted in something more innate objective

1158
01:21:53,300 --> 01:22:00,260
Be it biology or be it our hierarchies or be it our traditions gender isn't something that's malleable. It is something

1159
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:06,420
Uh, well, you don't even have to say have to say binary, but it is something that you just can't decide for yourself

1160
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:10,900
How do we find a how do we reconcile these almost

1161
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:13,780
irreconcilable, uh

1162
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:16,500
Assertions or proclamations. Yeah, well

1163
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:22,580
So my perspective is there's four

1164
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:28,180
There are four different perspectives on every single issue every single contention. There's four different perspectives. Yeah

1165
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:31,860
There's the far right

1166
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:37,940
Which is incorrect the far left perspective, which is incorrect. Then there's the reasonable left and the reasonable right perspective

1167
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:42,420
So like

1168
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,660
As a side example like abortion

1169
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:50,100
The far right perspective is the moment of sperm fertilized an egg. That's a human being that's wrong. I don't that does make any sense to me

1170
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,500
That's unintuitive. It's it's a silly position

1171
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:57,060
The far left position is we can abort a child even after it's born. Okay, so those are the two extremes

1172
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:03,060
I think yeah, yeah, so the what's what's the what's the correct left wing perspective?

1173
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:04,500
um

1174
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:08,980
The moment a sperm fertilized an egg. It's not a human being at some point it does become a human being

1175
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:11,780
but

1176
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:14,260
We have to allow abortion prior to

1177
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:18,740
Some for some time after the sperm being fertilized or the egg being fertilized, right?

1178
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:22,100
So there's some perspective where abortion should be allowed. That's a reasonable left wing perspective

1179
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:27,700
The reasonable right wing perspective is at some point that sperm that fertilized egg does become a human being

1180
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:34,740
And we need to not allow abortion for that. So the the there's two far extremes far right far left

1181
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:40,260
Those are wrong and then and then the middle left and the middle right gets synthesized

1182
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:47,620
So I that's like a and that's just one example. I believe that I believe you can take that approach on every single issue immigration abortion

1183
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:50,420
and you can even in a weird way to

1184
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:56,020
You know break it down to like if you have a personal disagreement with someone like if you're in a relationship and there's some argument

1185
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,660
You can use that map

1186
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,500
In the same way it obviously doesn't apply because it's not like a political ideology

1187
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:08,660
But every belief there's too far of one, you know, it's like the golden middle, right? Aristotelian mean, is that what it is?

1188
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:11,140
right, there's always little way

1189
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,380
to evaluate

1190
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:15,380
Any moral issue, right?

1191
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:22,180
So I don't actually so the the you're you're put you're saying if it was the case that there's a fundamental

1192
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,500
irreconcilable difference

1193
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:26,660
between

1194
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:31,460
Broadly the left or the right on a particular issue. How do we go about doing that? I would challenge

1195
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:35,220
I would say I don't believe reality is set up such that that actually exists

1196
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:43,780
I believe that so we have multiple differences. Okay. Yes. I don't think I think I think to the degree that something appears to be an irreconcilable difference

1197
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:45,300
and it's like

1198
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,380
you know to your point like to your credit like

1199
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:54,660
We are in a very polarized state right now, which would very easily lead everyone to believe of course, there's irreconcilable differences. Duh

1200
01:24:55,380 --> 01:25:02,100
But I would say that fundamentally I think is a breakdown of communication and the gender example. I think is a good example because

1201
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:04,340
like

1202
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:05,940
gender and sex

1203
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:06,740
I

1204
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:11,700
Conceptualize is different gender is socially constructed and sex is biological male female and then masculine

1205
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,780
and feminine now man and woman is just whatever dude if

1206
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:22,100
Sometimes I'll refer to it biologically and if I'm talking to a trans person. Maybe I'll you know refer to them as whatever

1207
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:24,980
it's just it's it's it's that's not a big enough deal

1208
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:27,380
to

1209
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,060
to

1210
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,860
To die on a hill of how many use the words in this way

1211
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:37,780
But certainly masculine feminine socially constructed spectrum male and female is a binary there's intersex, but

1212
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,500
for all intents and purposes, it's a binary, right?

1213
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,500
So the irreconcilable difference I think is if is just a

1214
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:49,140
If we could get all the conservatives to agree like hey, you know how like

1215
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,100
Chuck Norris is a man

1216
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:53,780
and

1217
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:54,900
uh

1218
01:25:54,900 --> 01:26:01,540
You know, who's a fucking super skinny kind of you know, you know how uh, Mick Jagger is a man, you know how like

1219
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:07,220
Yeah, yeah, you know how like they're both men, but Mick Jagger is a little bit, you know more kind of flamboyant and

1220
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:12,420
Feminine yeah, and Chuck Norris is like, you know, this kind of classic masculine type whatever

1221
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:17,380
We can recognize that there's a there's a spectrum in there, right? And it's and it's influenced by you know

1222
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,380
How they're raised and their culture and all that okay

1223
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:24,340
Boom masculinity and gender is a social construct, right? Okay

1224
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:27,460
Sex is so that we're not the concerned

1225
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,380
This the centrist's job is to get conservatives to recognize that

1226
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:33,940
okay, and then

1227
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:40,580
To the leftists or the far left or whatever so hey male and female. There's some variation, but like

1228
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:43,380
every

1229
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:45,380
possible

1230
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:50,740
Male and female are fundamental biological categories that that are older than

1231
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:53,620
uh

1232
01:26:53,620 --> 01:27:00,180
You know like billion, you know billions hundreds of millions of years old like plants have gametes, right?

1233
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:03,940
Plants have pollen and other like male and female are fundamental categories

1234
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:09,140
And there's a lot of differences between males and females that are clearly biological and not socially constructed

1235
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:10,820
and

1236
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:16,420
Our socially constructed roles do have some correlate like masculinity correlates to maleness

1237
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,300
right like a like, you know

1238
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,780
Why are what you know if we're talking about gender roles?

1239
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:26,340
Why are most of the physical labor jobs all met? Well because males on average are stronger

1240
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:31,940
So the social so the socialized role of masculine being physical labor physical

1241
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,300
Clearly has something to do with being male, but there's women who are strong as well

1242
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:39,300
So there's no reason to have that social distinction be binary

1243
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:44,420
Even though the underlying biology that the social distinctions related to is binary, right?

1244
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:50,100
There's there's room to expand things and also with technology we decouple social roles from biology

1245
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:53,060
So like as a male I I've I've never hunted

1246
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:58,180
Right, and if the world all actually went out tomorrow, I would starve. I am not

1247
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,980
I'm not

1248
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:06,340
What would you say the male the traditional male role of like hunting all that shit

1249
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:11,540
It is not it's not something I engage in because technology has decoupled the need for me to be a hunter

1250
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:17,220
Versus I can go to the grocery store and I can you know do other things right so like

1251
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:19,380
clearly

1252
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:23,380
There's a social aspect and the more technology we have and the more society changes the more we can

1253
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:30,580
Differentiate the gender role from the underlying biology right like the birth control pill, right like you know women

1254
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:33,860
It would be much more difficult for women to

1255
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:36,580
travel the world in the ancient times

1256
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:42,340
Because you know there was no birth control and no tampons and no any and like you know any of that stuff and it's like

1257
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:46,100
I'm not a woman, but I bet if I asked most most women

1258
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:50,180
Hey, if all tampons and birth control and all of that went away tomorrow

1259
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:53,220
Would that make your life more difficult in virtually every way?

1260
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:56,180
Yes, it would and so

1261
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:00,100
You know you just think like that's that was the norm for 2000 years and

1262
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,220
You know, maybe it's like okay. That's why

1263
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:08,980
Women weren't you know for we're not leading armies as often aside from not being able to fight

1264
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,340
but it's like

1265
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:13,620
You're just weighed down by this biological burden that women have that

1266
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:18,500
Technology has been able to alleviate in a lot of ways. So anyway, that's a whole roundabout way of saying

1267
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:23,540
I don't believe that was one example of where I don't think there isn't a reconcilable difference and I

1268
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:26,260
ontologically disagree that

1269
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,260
there are such things as

1270
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:30,420
irreconcilable

1271
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,060
Um

1272
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:37,620
Positions now there are people who are erect like there are people who are so far gone on either side

1273
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:43,540
That they're that they are irreconcilable and also like psychopathy exists. Yeah. Um, we're talking about

1274
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,100
Yeah, we're talking at a yeah, I see that yeah

1275
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:51,060
I think you know, this is why because like for me ontologically I'm completely in the opposite side where I think

1276
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:53,220
essentially

1277
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,220
Reality is a conflict

1278
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:58,500
You know, and this is where I'm even a christian here where

1279
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:02,340
There's a brokenness of reality. It's as if something

1280
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:05,380
went terribly wrong

1281
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:11,540
You know in christian I would call it the fall but there is so for me, which is why I think in fact

1282
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,980
There's a lecanian point

1283
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:17,380
Truth is found in the conflict itself

1284
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:20,420
And I don't think the conflict is ever reconciled

1285
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:24,580
Which is why here's where I'm sure you'd agree agree with me on this

1286
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:28,100
I'm a strong believer in dialogue

1287
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:34,980
And conversation even if conversation can be heated and it can get ugly. I still believe we ought to

1288
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:39,060
Converse at all times and I'm a free speech absolute absolutist

1289
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:41,220
um, so

1290
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:44,180
So, okay, uh, I think we kind of touched on the point a

1291
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:49,060
A lot more than we should have but I I see that I see that um, yeah, here's here's the other thing

1292
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:53,140
I was thinking let's probably go if you don't mind pull to point number five

1293
01:30:54,020 --> 01:31:01,860
Sure feel of difference the first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movements is an appeal against the intruders

1294
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:07,460
Toss or fascism is racist by definition. I believe that's how you pronounce

1295
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:13,780
So this is again

1296
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:18,900
It's I don't I don't mean to connect everything to the trans issue, but I feel like it's something that's just

1297
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:22,980
Yeah, it's a cultural touch point. It's a cultural touch point and into that

1298
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:27,780
Therefore, it's just that kind of easy thing to point to there. Suddenly. I you know is

1299
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,500
society is fundamentally

1300
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:39,060
Currently in a point of change. We have all these new ways of being we have new ways of people expressing their their gender their sexuality

1301
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:41,620
and I would say

1302
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:45,460
Peterson for me at least seems like he's touching into

1303
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:47,620
Uh

1304
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:54,820
Or at least he himself, which is quite ironic given that he is such an open person who who you know focuses on philosophy and ideas all the time

1305
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:58,340
Uh, he has hey he has this kind of

1306
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:04,100
I would probably I wouldn't even call it like a spite or a hateful thing. It's not I'm not trying to moralize it

1307
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:06,340
I'll put put any kind of moral baggage, but

1308
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:11,300
He he has this feel of difference of what's happening in the

1309
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:16,020
The the trans movement, uh, and and and and kissing point is

1310
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:23,620
Uh, I think a few months ago, uh, kyle kalensky again a person. I really like I watch him all the time secular talk

1311
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:28,660
Uh interviewed peterson and asked him would you would you ban?

1312
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,580
trans uh

1313
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:34,500
Oh a conversion surgery, uh, even for adults. Yeah for adults. Yeah

1314
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:39,700
Yeah, I was like personally for me. I would say unequivocally. No, I wouldn't if you're me too

1315
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:43,780
Just you know do what do what you want to do, uh, right?

1316
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:50,660
You know, um, but he said, uh, I've got to think about it because he was and here's where I think he was trying to play

1317
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:54,260
You know daddy who's telling society how to be you know, like you should live this way

1318
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:59,300
Which is which is which is fine. Like I mean we look I I think he's got uh, I I believe this

1319
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:04,260
Sincerely, I think he's trying to do what's right. He's got good at least to us at least

1320
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:10,340
To to to the extent that one can have good intent. He he does have good intent

1321
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,140
um, and so do you think

1322
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:16,020
He he unfortunately

1323
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:20,260
falls into this point here where he does have this kind of fear of difference where

1324
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:25,540
The trans thing isn't just merely about free speech. It is something beyond that to this idea of

1325
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,100
breaking down binaries, let's say

1326
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:31,780
Yeah, well this um, and maybe in just f y maybe this is

1327
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:35,780
The last point we can wrap up on and then because there's there's when we're done

1328
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,340
And when we're done this conversation, I want to ask you something after we're done recording

1329
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:43,540
But this yeah, maybe this is we can we can end here and have a chance for another one. Um

1330
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:46,740
This goes back to the point about

1331
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:52,500
Again, I feel like this can be used to describe basically anything that is bad

1332
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:55,140
We're like fear of difference

1333
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:58,260
That's a human universal doesn't fascism or otherwise

1334
01:33:58,820 --> 01:34:03,140
That's like tribalism. These people are different from me different equals

1335
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:07,140
Potential but also danger

1336
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:13,620
I don't know if that's true though when you say it's a human universal sort of interrupting because I would say I am very much

1337
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:16,740
enamored by difference like my my whole life is

1338
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:21,060
Looking into difference like I constantly look into what's novel what's new

1339
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,740
You know, I in fact get aesthetic pleasure from it. So

1340
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:27,460
sure, but that but

1341
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:32,500
You know, it's it's it's it's a it's relative difference, right? So for example, if I'm comparing two cars

1342
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:35,460
you know, uh

1343
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:39,540
Pick up truck in a lamborghini. There's a lot of different, you know, there's a there's a lot of difference there

1344
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:43,540
But they're both cars and if I'm comparing two different cultures a lot of difference there

1345
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:50,260
But we're both we have some common understanding if you know, like a psychopath who literally sees the world differently from you

1346
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:55,460
You know, it's like how much difference are you? I see what I'm saying like the difference

1347
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,340
I see that you know saying yeah, so

1348
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,500
and and and that's

1349
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:03,380
you know

1350
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,380
Like we loved we love to travel

1351
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:07,860
precisely because

1352
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:10,180
and it's interesting because like

1353
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,620
It's I think it's the opposite

1354
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:14,100
We love to travel not because we like to experience different cultures

1355
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:17,460
But because in the experience of the difference we recognize our commonality

1356
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:24,180
Right that wherever I go people still love each other and you know, they eat and share meals and all that stuff and it's kind of that

1357
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,340
the

1358
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:29,540
By exploring the differences we have a deeper appreciation for our commonality

1359
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:35,940
But if we truly went somewhere where it was different like we're like no children are abused for fun and ritual here

1360
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:38,820
There's a reason you'd be afraid of that, right?

1361
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,500
So fear of difference

1362
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:45,700
You know, I think

1363
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:52,580
Again, I think that's inherent and it's the quick like the quick it's like is but again Peterson's whole thing is

1364
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:55,780
No differences where opportunity lies, right?

1365
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:59,860
Like you have to you know get out like the whole Abraham story get out of your dad's tent

1366
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:02,420
get out of your dad's basement and go out into the world because

1367
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:09,780
Chaos, you know slay the dragon to get the gold you have to confront difference and fear and the you have to confront

1368
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:14,420
Confront the unknown to bring about order you have to make order out of the unknown

1369
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:18,660
Because if you're just in order all the time you have nothing to just become stagnant. Yeah

1370
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:23,380
So the fear of difference, you know, but again, I like I also think

1371
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:27,940
Well, is is is the far left, you know, the the the super

1372
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:32,900
Gender ideologues are they not also fear of difference from their orthodoxy?

1373
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:36,340
Well, yeah, yeah a conservative christian or a conservative

1374
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:38,900
Muslim or something like wouldn't they be

1375
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:42,340
Wait a second. This person has a very rigid

1376
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:45,780
Uh

1377
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,140
Appreciation for these traditions that we hold to be bad

1378
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:55,460
So they would just you know, their fear would be just as much as anyone else's right? That's why I'm saying it's a kind of universal

1379
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:59,620
So you're trying. Yeah, I see that. Yeah, I have a few points about difference

1380
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:01,060
But I think

1381
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:04,420
We're short on time and you said you've got a question to ask from me

1382
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:08,980
But before you do ask that question, Paul, could I uh, could I just request?

1383
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:11,780
I I really want to read the excerpt out of the

1384
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:17,140
Hanaran book because it's connected to a lot of the points here. It's connected. Yeah number 10

1385
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:18,740
Um

1386
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:22,980
So do you want to first ask me the question and then I'll read so I want to ask you something after we record

1387
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:30,180
Or after the recording's over when we're done. It's a logistical question unrelated to that. Oh, yeah, absolutely. So, uh, anyway

1388
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:35,620
There are there are a few other look. I'm not certainly saying from my point of view that

1389
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:41,140
Peterson perfectly aligns to all 14 of these points that would be bizarre and insane

1390
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:44,660
I'm just looking at a few points here and trying to view his work

1391
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,380
via this framework

1392
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:49,540
and a big thing

1393
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:53,380
Here's okay. This is going to be a difficult thing to articulate, but I'm going to try my best. So

1394
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:57,780
A big thing for him

1395
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,980
which I

1396
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:01,940
Was initially quite enamored by this idea of strength

1397
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:05,700
I've always appreciated strength the appreciated competence

1398
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:09,940
and this kind of being the best version of yourself to use like a

1399
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:12,740
terrible cliched cliched term

1400
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:18,900
And the the importance of putting yourself together and and and trying to in some sense

1401
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:25,460
Be be a gold, you know, just like aspire towards this highest ideal and in in many ways he himself is

1402
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:32,340
very much enamored by the strongman persona. He loves people like jaco or people like, um

1403
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,540
Even Joe Rogan, um, yeah

1404
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:37,700
Joe Rogan is a complicated

1405
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:38,980
case, but

1406
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:44,900
Sure, not all complicated. Yeah, aren't we aren't we all uh, so the point Hannah Aaron makes though is

1407
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:50,340
Peterson and in his book maps of meaning he he's I recall I read it a few years ago. He says

1408
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:57,380
The the course for a totalitarianism or fascism just to keep it within context

1409
01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:06,100
Is apathy indifference this feeling of uh, I don't care. I'm not going to carry the world's burden and do something about it

1410
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:14,260
But funny enough though Hannah Aaron makes the complete opposite point and and she says no in fact

1411
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:19,460
Indifference by itself isn't a reason for fascism or apathy by itself

1412
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:23,300
So people just minding their own business that say they're not caring about what's going on in the world

1413
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:25,700
isn't a reason for fascism, but it's

1414
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:29,940
Quite the contrary the opposite where it's people who think

1415
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:35,380
That they have to be this great person this this strongman. This this hero who

1416
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:39,780
carries the burden of the world and and lives his like Nietzschean life

1417
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:41,380
uh

1418
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:46,100
Those are the people that end up becoming fascists and so this uh, just for this conversation

1419
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:49,220
I I had I read this a while back, but I had to like I

1420
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:55,220
I was I I did highlight the point so I could find it easily. Um, this is the penguin

1421
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:59,380
The the the penguin modern classics version so page 100

1422
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:03,220
Sorry page 410

1423
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:09,940
Uh from Hannah Aaron's the origins of totalitarianism great book. I recommend it. I recommend everyone should read it

1424
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:13,540
It's it's a it's a very easy read too. Like she's a really good writer

1425
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:18,340
So I'm not gonna page 410 though. It is page 4 and 10. Yeah, I told you

1426
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:24,740
I'm into this nerdy shit. You know that, right? You probably already figured that out. Right, right. That's fair

1427
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:30,580
But here's so I'm not gonna read the whole page. That'll take way too long, but there are two excerpts the first is

1428
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:36,340
She states this is about what leads to uh totalitarianism

1429
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:40,100
Now this is in the context of post world war two

1430
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:47,620
Indifference to public affairs neutrality on political issues are in themselves no sufficient course

1431
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:50,100
for the rise of totalitarian movements

1432
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:52,420
so

1433
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:57,540
That that's the point I made before indifference isn't particularly a bad thing and then she goes on to explain

1434
01:40:58,420 --> 01:40:59,700
that

1435
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:05,300
The problem though is in fact when she calls it the bourgeois society the bourgeois society

1436
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,420
When they start feeling some of the things

1437
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:12,900
Animated in this list things like the fear of difference things like uh

1438
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:22,420
Where's the other one? I'm not content for the week. Sorry. Uh, selective populism where the the the majority of people are feeling threatened by these

1439
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:27,540
Minorities like it could be the lgbdq folks or you know migrants or whoever

1440
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:33,380
I don't think most people in the west are afraid of migrants. I would let's just focus on uh the lgbdq

1441
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:41,060
That that group so and then she says the bourgeois feel threatened by them to their way of life to their traditions

1442
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:49,140
And therefore what happens is they they look for this strongman this this failure and then she states

1443
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:52,020
sorry not this failure this uh

1444
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:54,020
this this person who's gonna um

1445
01:41:54,500 --> 01:42:00,660
Kind of embody all the the burdens of the public and do something about it like let's say even like a trumpian figure

1446
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:06,820
Uh, these but these bourgeois attitudes are very useful for those forms of dictatorship

1447
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:11,300
So the attitude she talks about is kind of what I describe as feeling of or what's going on

1448
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:15,940
We're living in uncertain times our way of life is being challenged. It's being

1449
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:18,980
Destroyed by these outsiders by the other

1450
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:26,500
These bourgeois attitudes are very useful for these forms of dictatorship in which and here's the important point

1451
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:34,020
A strong man takes upon himself the troublesome responsibility for the conduct of public affairs

1452
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:40,420
They are positive hindrance to totalitarian movements which can tolerate bourgeois individualism

1453
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:42,900
No more than any kind of individualism

1454
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:46,980
So the the the point she's trying to make is that the the latter bit didn't really matter

1455
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:49,700
but the point point point she's trying to make is when

1456
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:52,260
The strong man

1457
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:57,700
Beals the kind of burden of society and is that it places heroic role almost

1458
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:01,940
You know messianic role to to to save people

1459
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:08,420
That is what leads to this card personality and she goes on to like mob rule and whatnot and gives rise to a fascist

1460
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:11,620
Like like a Hitler or like a miscellany or

1461
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:14,500
uh, like a metwaltz sometimes, um

1462
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:16,500
so

1463
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:23,700
Anyway, just that that's the point i'm trying to make here because he does emphasize a lot on the importance of strength and the strong man and greatness

1464
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:26,580
Do you think that?

1465
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:30,020
i'm not saying there's a direct correlation, but it's a there's this like

1466
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:32,820
fine line where it could

1467
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:40,580
Either inadvertently let's say lead to fascistic tendencies in society as a whole

1468
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:43,780
In peterson's work or in waltz

1469
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:51,540
Oh, no, no, not not. I don't I don't care about waltz. I in fact think he's his penis work. Uh, peasants. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I agree here. Yeah

1470
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:54,260
um

1471
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:55,300
so

1472
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:57,380
And this is such an interesting topic because

1473
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:02,820
It gets into the archetypal structure of the human mind. Hmm where

1474
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:05,860
I believe and I think it is

1475
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:07,940
the case

1476
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:09,940
That to be human

1477
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:12,900
Means you have you have within you

1478
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:17,700
a predisposal to respond to certain

1479
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:21,620
What would you call it? Uh

1480
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:27,140
Certain

1481
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:31,300
Symbols and words and

1482
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:36,820
Psychological content, you know in a certain way you are predisposed to respond

1483
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:41,700
To certain psychological content in a certain way and the example of that would be

1484
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:45,300
Exactly your point about strength. Why why why are

1485
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:48,020
Why is it the case that all human beings

1486
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:50,420
would be wired

1487
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:51,380
for

1488
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:53,940
To admire strength inherently. Well

1489
01:44:54,660 --> 01:45:00,660
From an evolutionary perspective, the obvious reason would be you need strong people to keep you from getting eaten by, you know

1490
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:04,580
Werewolves and all that shit or not werewolves, but you know, yeah

1491
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:08,660
Well, well that affordably werewolves and all that dragon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1492
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:15,780
No, but hold on. Just just just remember mate. I think I didn't make myself clear. Hannah. Yeah, go ahead. I make a natural

1493
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:18,100
naturalistic claim. Sorry. I can't talk today

1494
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:23,540
I'm getting very kind of excited about this topic because this is something I've talked about a lot. It's more

1495
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:30,660
She's she's in fact making a very marxist point here where she's she's despite. She's not a marxist

1496
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:34,660
She's saying it's the bourgeois society. So that's essentially most of us

1497
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:40,660
Uh, yep, we kind of have this individualistic way of life. They do they do things how they do things

1498
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:46,740
And then when that way of life feels threatened, so it's not all human beings feel threatened by

1499
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:48,820
different

1500
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:51,780
Certain kind of people which is let's say the majority

1501
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:55,620
I'm not saying that's the case, but just for all the intentional purposes

1502
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:58,420
When the majority feels threatened

1503
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:03,940
A strong man comes into power and this is a cult personality. Sure. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair

1504
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:08,900
And I so I would tie that into what I said. So there's there's that universal element

1505
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:14,580
There's the archetypal element where to be human means you are wired to respond to certain

1506
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:16,580
you know

1507
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:18,580
content or behaviors or symbols

1508
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:20,580
and I would say and so

1509
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:27,940
Recognizing that so when it comes to what happens when the middle class what happens when my way of life gets threatened, you know, it's like, um

1510
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:32,420
If you know if we can talk about this like it's like the school shootings, right?

1511
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:34,420
You know how many like in america

1512
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:41,060
People view as this epidemic while these, you know, like in uvalde and newtown and all these different places. It's like, yeah, that's bad

1513
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:44,100
You know, obviously, I don't feel any

1514
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:48,580
You know, unless your psychopath you disagree

1515
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:51,700
But you have to remember like

1516
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:56,180
That happens every day in chicago and every day in these inner cities

1517
01:46:56,340 --> 01:47:00,820
You know how many kids are shot and people are shot every day and we don't hear about it

1518
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:05,860
But as soon as the massacre occurs at a place that looks like where I would have gone to school

1519
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,900
Now it's a significant issue

1520
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:11,300
and to me that

1521
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:17,620
I don't know that when you were describing what hennard was saying that evokes of that kind of idea where oh now my

1522
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:22,980
School is getting shot up. That's not supposed to happen. Everything else. That's that you know, that just

1523
01:47:23,620 --> 01:47:27,220
I don't think about that but what now it's in my the bourgeoisie kind of perspective

1524
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:30,180
and

1525
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:32,420
Yeah, it's like

1526
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:38,340
So, you know in some sense, I just agree straight up, you know, I I think uh

1527
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:41,860
Yeah, I don't I don't

1528
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:46,820
Because it is it is the people who have to live day to day and don't concern themselves with

1529
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,900
That's the shootings are their way of life. So there's no

1530
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:53,780
tension that

1531
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:55,300
catalyzes some

1532
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:57,860
broader movement because that's just how they're in on the day to day

1533
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:03,060
But yeah, when when it's the bourgeoisie so to speak that gets the privilege perspective that gets threatened

1534
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:05,140
I can see that in many ways what

1535
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:07,860
What kind of saddens me is I think

1536
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:10,420
unfortunately

1537
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:15,540
Peterson's work has now just become a way to just justify the status quo

1538
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:19,940
It's it's become a way to justify the typical bourgeois way of life

1539
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:25,940
Which as a leftist and again, I'm biased here because I come from a left-wing point of view. Um

1540
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:28,660
I'm pull on a leftist

1541
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:29,860
uh

1542
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:33,940
What even that like because you're not fully a leftist at least not my definition because

1543
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:39,380
You don't you know, if you don't buy into what I would regard as stereotypically leftist like

1544
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:44,020
Children like KKK is you know the conservatives are KKK and children

1545
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:47,300
I don't know your perspective on children being allowed to transition. I'm very

1546
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:51,780
Yeah, that's tough on man. I mean I am more on your side with that

1547
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:57,460
Right and that's a function of just the medical literature. That's almost not even a philosophical

1548
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:02,500
Exactly. Yeah, whether or not what is the empirical data say? I think yeah, look my like I

1549
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:07,460
When I was I interrupted you I interrupted you. No, no, that's that's totally fine

1550
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:11,540
But I'm just too on your point like when I was a kid. I didn't even know, you know, if

1551
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:17,940
I don't even know if I was real, you know, like it was probably my whole other traumatic different thing

1552
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:23,300
I think you psychoanalyzed myself, but therefore one should be yeah, I think I'm more on the idea of

1553
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:27,140
Over there, perhaps I'm a bit more conservative when it comes to children

1554
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:29,060
but but

1555
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:34,340
Especially when it comes to economics, you know, I I believe I strongly believe in unions, you know, I think

1556
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:41,700
Most most things should be public and and you know, anyway economically speaking. I'm certainly a leftist

1557
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:43,460
Uh

1558
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:49,860
And and my problem though is that's where that's why I was I was really keen to read out this this excerpt from hanaran's book

1559
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:55,460
Because what she says is these these people who feel threatened aren't

1560
01:49:56,580 --> 01:50:02,660
Aren't she doesn't say everyone feels threatened. She's very specific to to put it to because she's a social social philosopher

1561
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:04,100
to a

1562
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:10,260
To a certain group of people which is a majority that the bourgeois the bourgeoisie for the bourgeois way of life and and

1563
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:13,060
Here's where I mean, I get very very

1564
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:17,060
Kind of if you know, um, I would consider myself an anti capitalist

1565
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:19,620
Even though I see

1566
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:21,700
Capitalism has has its merits too

1567
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:24,820
And you know, like where Peterson says

1568
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:29,620
You know, you you go and do your thing, you know, like focus on your life be be great

1569
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:31,700
You build your business

1570
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:34,180
But but here you know at one point though

1571
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:36,980
I think we should all go back to good old Christianity and be like no

1572
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:40,980
At sometimes, you know, you shouldn't go and do your thing even though your life is in shambles

1573
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:42,180
You should probably go and

1574
01:50:42,180 --> 01:50:49,620
Be live a life of service and yeah, I said, you know, you know, maybe maybe live live via christian metaphysics and yeah

1575
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:52,660
I don't know if you saw my critique of jordan peterson

1576
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:56,900
It's called rest in peace or we need to rescue jordan peterson from the belly of the whale

1577
01:50:56,980 --> 01:51:01,140
I watched that. Yes. Yeah, my whole point was like, hey, I don't know if I mentioned it in that one

1578
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:03,700
But I mentioned it somewhere where I was good. Yeah, it's like, hey, there's

1579
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:08,900
Peterson's really fallen into this like I'm a dirt. I'm an evil capitalist and I don't apologize about it

1580
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:10,900
It's like, okay. Well, that's a problem

1581
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:15,140
Because there's problems with capitalism and like I'm gonna I think I'm gonna do a video on

1582
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:20,660
Eric Weinstein's Marxism is what I'm gonna call it something like that where Eric Weinstein has some very

1583
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:23,300
salient critiques of capitalism

1584
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:29,140
That are, you know, map on to Marxism and not derive from Marxism per se, but it's like

1585
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:32,100
So when you say you're an anti-capitalist, I'm like I

1586
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:34,900
completely

1587
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:39,460
Maybe I wouldn't go so far as to use that term, but I'm certainly sympathetic to whatever you for the same reasons

1588
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:44,820
I would call I would consider myself a post capitalist. I think we live in post sure. That's fair. Yes

1589
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:50,420
We have surplus value and we need to figure out how to make society more. Yeah, especially with AI coming

1590
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:55,300
It's like man. Last thing we need is more innovation. We need to figure out how to get this fixed

1591
01:51:55,620 --> 01:52:00,260
Yeah, and you know the reason and again, you know, here I'm very traditional the reason I am that it's because I'm a Christian

1592
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:03,620
I believe in the teachings of Christ that we in fact should

1593
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:09,060
base a society not that not a society that's transactional but rather a society that's

1594
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,540
undergirded by love

1595
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:13,780
And here I'm very much a christian so

1596
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:19,060
And then that's where I'm I'm wondering and I look paula. I may be being a bit unfair

1597
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:22,500
You know with you here because you certainly

1598
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:24,020
Uh

1599
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:28,740
Are true to what you proclaim and you do criticize Peterson like in that video

1600
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:31,380
When you you see he's wrong

1601
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:32,820
but

1602
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:35,860
In some sense by being kind of an apologist for Peterson

1603
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:40,420
I wonder if if you can't miss out on that that idea of oh

1604
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:44,740
He's just defending the status quo now. Like, you know, he's critical of

1605
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:50,820
Virtually everything is critical of Greta Thunberg's, uh, you know climate climate change book

1606
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:56,260
He's critical of any any kind of leftist movement that tries to make society a bit more egalitarian

1607
01:52:56,580 --> 01:53:02,100
It seems like and maybe this happens since you joined daily wire. I don't know, but I maybe that's great

1608
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:05,700
That's doing a little harm than good. Sure. I would push back on some of those

1609
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:09,140
I don't think he's critical of every leftist movement because again

1610
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:12,420
I think he makes in my opinion

1611
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:14,900
The best intellectual

1612
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:18,820
philosophical case for why the left needs to exist

1613
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:22,340
Right. Like his case for why we need liberals

1614
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:25,460
Is compelling even to conservatives. I think

1615
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:33,940
Um going back to that point about you need the left to be able to update the current structures to new environments. Yeah, yeah, yeah

1616
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:35,940
so

1617
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:37,700
but to your point

1618
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:42,660
In my apologia for Jordan Peterson. I may be missing the degree to which she values a status quo

1619
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:45,940
Certainly possible. I mean, I know I'm biased so I'm

1620
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:50,900
Also, I know I'm I know I'm dumb. So I'm missing things off that regard and I know I'm biased

1621
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:54,740
So I'm missing things on a whole lot. Yeah, so the the idea of I'm missing things for sure

1622
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:57,140
the I don't

1623
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:02,100
That point about I may be defending the state or you know, could be defending the status quo too much

1624
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:03,380
I would kind of

1625
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:04,900
push back and say

1626
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:08,980
The status quo needs to be defended to some degree status quo does not mean bad

1627
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:10,580
per se

1628
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:13,940
Even though like when we use that phrase like you're just defending the status quo

1629
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:20,260
The obvious implication is that that's not a good thing and the simple interpretation of why that is the case is

1630
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:26,340
Well, the status quo was you know, slavery was a thing and then black people were indiscriminated against and then status quo was women weren't getting

1631
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:28,180
Right, so

1632
01:54:28,180 --> 01:54:30,660
When people say the status quo, they're usually referring to

1633
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:33,700
The moral failings of our current society

1634
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:37,940
But if but if the status quo just means like, you know, the current state, right?

1635
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:41,620
Or I don't know what actually the latin, you know, you know, whatever that means, but like

1636
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:48,020
You could very easily say like well, the status quo includes like the first amendment like we have free speech. That's status quo

1637
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:51,380
So that needs to be defended, right? So it's so

1638
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:57,620
It's it's it's a back and forth in that way. I think I think you know, I know kyle our mutual friend

1639
01:54:57,620 --> 01:55:02,820
He's a he's very much a fan of uh, john vacay and here's where again

1640
01:55:02,820 --> 01:55:03,860
kyle

1641
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:05,860
Maxwell. Yeah, Maxwell. Yeah

1642
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:11,060
You've had you've had him on a couple of times. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. In fact, I found you via his

1643
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:15,220
Okay, that's right. Yes. I was trying to remember how how yeah, we came in contact

1644
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:18,900
Yeah, yeah, and and I kind of cause a huge fan of uh, john vacay

1645
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:20,180
vacay, yes

1646
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:25,140
Vacay and so vacay has this idea of dialogues, which is I certainly I fall on that cam too

1647
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:31,620
It's like there has to be this constant to and fro but the vacay because he comes from like a kind of like a holistic perspective

1648
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:34,740
He's like, uh, we we all have a conversation

1649
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:38,420
You know, it's like we all see kumbaya and it comes like this higher truth

1650
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:40,500
And I personally am more of

1651
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:43,780
I'm a a nazi zhikian where I think it's this

1652
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:46,740
Truth is found not in a higher truth itself

1653
01:55:47,060 --> 01:55:52,100
It's found in the conflict itself and the conflict is ongoing. It'll never end. It's like a sure

1654
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:59,140
So like the the hagel's idea a lot of people mischaracterized hagel and I am not saying I understand hagel because I absolutely don't

1655
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:02,900
But they say oh, there's a theses a theses

1656
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:05,380
Antithesis and then there's a synthesis a higher

1657
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:08,740
sublation hagel's and say that hagel says in fact, it's a

1658
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:13,300
ongoing thing where spirit unravels where it's just

1659
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:19,060
There's a theses antithesis and there's a synthesis and there's another theses antithesis synthesis

1660
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:25,700
So it's it's as if and it kind of relates to what you're saying too because the left and right have to be in conversation

1661
01:56:25,780 --> 01:56:28,100
Or sometimes conflict hopefully

1662
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:37,220
Without too much bloodshed or violence that in fact that's reality itself. It's just that it's not some higher outcome and

1663
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:42,260
and okay, I'm going off on a rant here and I'm kind of netting out on hagel but

1664
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:46,820
One thing I think we can all agree is that point you made that we are all

1665
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:49,860
equally ignorant or

1666
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:55,220
as vosh said in your debate, he said that most people are retards, but

1667
01:56:56,180 --> 01:57:00,820
No, he's right man is retarded. Yeah, but he's right, but he's right, but he didn't go fine

1668
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:04,580
Well, the way he implied it. I don't think was right, but the point

1669
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:11,620
The the charitable interpretation of that point. Yes, we're all dumb. Yeah. Yeah, because you know zhuzhek zhuzhek makes a really good point

1670
01:57:11,620 --> 01:57:12,740
He says

1671
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:17,380
I'm not saying that there are these smart intellectuals and then there are these common people who are stupid

1672
01:57:17,380 --> 01:57:22,260
He's saying everyone's stupid. Even the intellectuals are stupid. That's what and I agree with him. I agree with him

1673
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:26,100
And yeah, look, mate. I feel like

1674
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:31,700
We've been a bit over the time. I hope you don't have anything else. No, no problem. I've got no other

1675
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:37,300
Obligations today that are but I think we did touch on I don't know personally for me

1676
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:42,020
I I wasn't planning to go through the whole list because that would be I think a waste of time

1677
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:45,300
But I think we did

1678
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:47,380
I don't know if you made I wouldn't even call it progress

1679
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:51,940
Well, we did clarify some some points pertaining to fascism that is from my

1680
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:55,540
Point of view, but before I you know before I put words in your mouth

1681
01:57:55,540 --> 01:58:01,460
Is there anything else that you want to elucidate or clarify? Not just regarding to the fascism, but but even yeah

1682
01:58:01,460 --> 01:58:04,340
Yeah, well, no, I just the most interesting watchers debate. Yeah

1683
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:07,940
Yeah, well on the on the debate, you know, I think

1684
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:09,940
I

1685
01:58:09,940 --> 01:58:14,420
What I said at the beginning I think stands. I'm you know, but this other stuff I might think but in this conversation particular I was

1686
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:19,700
Again, you being a vosh fan and you being a self-described, you know

1687
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:25,220
Pretty hard leftist or certainly economically and all that and I'm I would actually like economically. I'm pretty far

1688
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:27,220
I don't do that many videos about economics

1689
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:28,980
um

1690
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:33,380
But I think that'll I might dip my toe into that to some degree. Um

1691
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:36,900
And I'm so I'm so I certainly feel you there, but it was just interesting like

1692
01:58:38,180 --> 01:58:43,460
I prior to this the last time we talked I would not have characterized you as or I would not have guessed that you were

1693
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:46,260
Like a big vosh fan or or anything like that

1694
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:49,860
um, and I and it just it just reaffirms my belief of like

1695
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:56,100
The attitude I went into that debate with of I'm going to speak to the best of vosh

1696
01:58:56,740 --> 01:59:01,380
Which in part is like I'm trying to speak to the good faith people who listen to him because they clearly are

1697
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:06,740
Right, if he was if he was as bad as people say he is people like you I don't think would be fans of them

1698
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:12,580
Right. Yeah. Yeah. So and I like I said, I have a friend of mine who's a fan of his and there's no chance

1699
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:16,660
I'm just gonna you know, he's a bad person because he likes bad people. Um

1700
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:22,420
So that that was so I enjoyed this. Yeah, it was it was just it was interesting to

1701
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:26,660
Elucidate that out and I'm I'm I'm reaffirmed in my belief that

1702
01:59:27,380 --> 01:59:28,500
You know, I could have done things better

1703
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:32,260
But I think the attitude that I went in was the right attitude and so I appreciate it

1704
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:35,940
Yeah, but we could you know turn the table so to speak and be oh

1705
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:38,420
Vosh's fans would see you

1706
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:41,140
Who I think you were

1707
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:46,340
You you you you were kind of like a great interlocutor for for wash. Let's say where

1708
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:52,420
Certainly you were coming from the the point of view you you were in a difficult place because you had to defend Peterson

1709
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:56,340
It's always harder to defend a stance than to critique and

1710
01:59:56,740 --> 01:59:59,300
And fought with a with a person or a

1711
01:59:59,540 --> 02:00:03,540
Especially when Peterson tweets so goddamn much and he says some of these stupid things, right?

1712
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:07,380
Correct. Yeah, and he's like he's everywhere and he's he's he's in fact a chaotic guy

1713
02:00:07,460 --> 02:00:11,540
Like he's all oh, yeah, he goes on all these podcasts. So it's it's not easy to do that

1714
02:00:12,020 --> 02:00:16,900
But then I I would say like for me personally because I knew you prior to the wash debate

1715
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:19,060
I knew you were a good bloke

1716
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:20,580
but

1717
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:21,700
now

1718
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:29,860
So-called radical leftist or whoever that's on washers side that think all uh, Peterson bros, uh, are these like I don't know

1719
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:32,580
White

1720
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:37,220
Idiots would probably have the same. Um, let's say

1721
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:39,940
I don't know revelation or or same kind of

1722
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:44,980
Peterson's fans the way you did about washers fans and I'm glad that there was that

1723
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:49,220
Yeah, I got probably a dozen or so comments saying yeah, hey, I'm a wash fan

1724
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:53,460
But I really appreciated the conversation, but I'm like that's good. That's a win as far as I'm concerned. Yeah

1725
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:56,020
awesome, uh

1726
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:58,020
Thanks a lot poll. I really appreciated this

1727
02:00:58,340 --> 02:01:03,460
As I said, man, I think you're a great bloke and congrats on all the success you're having with your channel recently

1728
02:01:03,860 --> 02:01:06,020
Hit 3 000 subscribers man. Yes

1729
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:10,420
I reckon you're gonna you're gonna be at 5k 10k no time

1730
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:14,980
Yes, we'll see we'll see what kind of risks and responsibilities that opens up

1731
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:19,940
So, uh, but you know, that's the point. Yeah, the risk of responsibilities is a is a

1732
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:22,980
It's certainly that comes along with great power as they say

1733
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:27,220
That great philosopher, um

1734
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:31,220
I haven't watched your video on the postmodern

1735
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:33,940
Neomaxist the recent one. I think you'd like that one

1736
02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:38,260
I probably would especially being a theory nerd. I take a look at that, but uh,

1737
02:01:38,980 --> 02:01:42,500
not very uh, it's it's very it's theory presented through the

1738
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:45,860
It's it's theory presented through the lens of

1739
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:48,820
This is nerd shit, but we need to talk about it type stuff

1740
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:55,060
I'll leave it at that. It does. It does. That's case in point there, right? It comes from the real world. Yeah. Yeah

1741
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:59,140
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just it's communicated in a way. That's not your traditional

1742
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:03,700
Oh, this is how we talk about theory. Well, you are a comedian comedy. You are a comedian. Exactly

1743
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:10,420
That's why that's why that's why I put it in there. All of this is jokes. It's just everything life is a joke, you know

1744
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:13,220
Life is a joke. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was right. It's all absurd

1745
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:18,340
All right, thanks. I think I'm gonna stop recording now and that works
