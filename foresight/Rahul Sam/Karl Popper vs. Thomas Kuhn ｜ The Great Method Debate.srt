1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
And that really, this is the question

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,880
that I want to start off with at a high level.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,600
The reason being, I've realized if anyone's

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,600
going to ask for me from now onwards,

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,040
what is philosophy of science?

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,360
Or can I have a bit of a brief introduction?

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,960
I just tell them to read chapter one of the Knowledge

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
Machine, because one of my favorite chapters

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,160
where you go through the history of, well, really,

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,760
20th century science, and this great method debate.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,080
So I'd love for you to, Michael,

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,480
maybe like expand and lay down.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,240
We've probably done this many times in previous broadcasts,

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,280
so I apologize if I got to repeat yourself.

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,480
The debate between Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,400
and what's this ongoing great method debate

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,800
in the philosophy of science.

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,000
You know, I think it all began when a lot of intellectuals

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,200
in the 20th century were looking at the mess

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:07,840
that the human race had made of, or at least the kind of the

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,360
European part of the human race had made of the world.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,920
And this is actually particularly

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,160
after the First World War, that's why I'm emphasizing Europe.

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,480
And decided that what they need to do

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,600
is to rebuild everything on rational principles.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,400
And at that time, that really meant scientific principles

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,320
for them.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,080
And so this question came out, what are scientific principles?

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,080
What is it to go about, for example,

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,520
constituting a state scientifically

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,440
or drawing up a moral code scientifically?

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,520
And those are deep, complicated questions

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,680
that I don't have answers to and I wasn't writing about in my book.

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,040
But of course, it turned all of these philosophers

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,200
into philosophers of science.

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,280
They had to say, here is the right way

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,640
to go about gaining knowledge, the scientific way,

38
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,840
as opposed to the other way.

39
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,520
So they wanted to be able to write down, in effect,

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,040
some rules for inquiry, not necessarily

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,760
a complete guide to inquiry, but some kind of set of rules

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,320
that was distinctive enough to separate science

43
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,200
from all the rest.

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,680
And what I call the great method debate

45
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,320
begins there with the attempt to say

46
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,720
what the scientific method is in a way that differentiates it

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,040
from all other forms of inquiry.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,240
And after the early difficulties in doing that,

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,800
that turned into a big debate about whether there even

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,480
was a scientific method.

51
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,040
And you can see one way to look at Papa's and Coon's work

52
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,920
is this, that Papa was someone who thought he knew

53
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,200
what the scientific method was.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,440
And he is a paradigm of one of these thinkers

55
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,680
who wanted to make the world scientific.

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,360
And he did write on politics as much as he did on science.

57
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,240
But anyway, so he's someone who believes

58
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,640
there's a scientific method, and he can tell you what it is,

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,600
and that the right sort of critical rational scientific mind

60
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,960
is the one that applies this method.

61
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,680
Probably more than anyone else in the history of,

62
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,280
at least in the history of 20th century philosophy

63
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,000
of science, Thomas Coon is identified

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,960
as someone who undercut Papa's project.

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,520
But Coon is not a negative philosophy.

66
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,440
He has his own actually quite sophisticated story

67
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,680
about how science works.

68
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,120
But it's really deeply different from the standard method

69
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,620
story.

70
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,320
And in fact, it's a story in which

71
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,880
scientists don't come out looking

72
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,520
like these kind of critical rationalists,

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,160
but something rather different.

74
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,640
And of course, we can talk a little bit more

75
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,080
about that in a moment, but rather than diving into it,

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,840
I just really want to stress this contrast

77
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,800
between, on the one hand, this single scientific method

78
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,000
that's the epitome of critical inquiry with Papa.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,800
And then with Coon, you have there's

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,760
a distinctive social organization in science.

81
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,840
But it actually involves many different methods

82
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,040
at different times, so there's not one unchanging method.

83
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,120
And furthermore, that setup is almost, you might say,

84
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,600
well, if not irrationalist, then there's

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,520
many elements to it that seem quite at odds with Papa's

86
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,080
very heroic view of scientific inquiry

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,920
as I say, the apex of rationality.

88
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,320
Yeah, I mean, after all, Papa was also

89
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,040
a political philosopher, right?

90
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,760
I mean, I've read his book, The Open Society,

91
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,440
and it's enemies of, anyway, the book on totalitarianism.

92
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,120
And he even calls Plato the person who

93
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,120
started all of totalitarianism.

94
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,520
It's quite interesting.

95
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,840
So Professor Streamins, if you could start with Papa,

96
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,000
and then, of course, the unfortifiability principle.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,080
Now, anyone could, I don't think it's that hard,

98
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,920
even for a layperson like myself,

99
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,360
to just Google what it means and get

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,280
a very elementary understanding.

101
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,320
So perhaps you could firstly just explain

102
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,880
what the Karl Popperian unfortifiability principle is.

103
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,920
But then also, as you've done in the book, rather well,

104
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
maybe lay down some of your criticisms,

105
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,880
criticisms of it just for the audience.

106
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,640
Yeah, sure.

107
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,920
So Papa thought that really the heart of the scientific method

108
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,480
was this very simple idea that if a theory makes

109
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,440
a false prediction, it has to be wrong somehow.

110
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,760
And Papa thought that at the core of the scientific inquiry

111
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,760
was the systematic elimination of all of the false theories.

112
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,640
And notionally, of course, you could imagine one day

113
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,360
having eliminated them all and just having

114
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,560
one true theory remaining, although as Papa

115
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,440
was understood as well as anyone,

116
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,160
that was not a realistic prospect.

117
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,720
But he thought we could at least think of ourselves

118
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,960
as making progress by eliminating the false theories.

119
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,200
So the thing that makes that, oh, go ahead.

120
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,880
No, I was just going to ask, please continue.

121
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm not going to follow up on that, but keep going, yeah.

122
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,440
OK, so the thing that makes that, though,

123
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,280
now turning to where he begins to run into difficulties.

124
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,600
And he had plenty of things to say about these difficulties,

125
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,680
not as if this is some sort of one-shot undermining

126
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,200
in his view.

127
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,320
But it's really difficult when a theory does

128
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,920
make a false prediction to figure out

129
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,920
whether it was really the theory's fault or not.

130
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,840
Science is such a complicated thing.

131
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,160
And in particular, the kinds of measurement apparatus

132
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,840
that are used to make observations in cutting-edge science

133
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,760
are often very complicated, fragile things that only

134
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,760
work when conditions are exactly right.

135
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,560
99.9% of the time, when you get a false prediction,

136
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,520
it's not really the theory's fault at all.

137
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,560
It's just that something went wrong with apparatus.

138
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,800
Or maybe you made a false assumption

139
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,520
when you were making your calculations.

140
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,240
Or maybe even, and this does happen,

141
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,040
there's an error in the software that you're

142
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,640
using to analyze your results.

143
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,560
And so it's not really the theory's fault or not,

144
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,080
and it would be a terrible mistake to throw away the theory

145
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,720
just because you got this false prediction.

146
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,760
So if you're going to capture the spirit of Papa's proposal,

147
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,240
you have to figure out some way of deciding when it's OK

148
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,880
to just say, oh, something went wrong with the apparatus.

149
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,760
And when you should say, Arno, this time it's the theory's fault.

150
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,080
And so we've falsified the theory, as he says.

151
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,880
We can throw away the theory.

152
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,280
Sometimes, of course, you can just

153
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,800
see that something went wrong with the apparatus.

154
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,720
Like, you know, it's smoking, making,

155
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,160
attracting.

156
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,400
But often, in many cases in the history of science,

157
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,640
we have results that were anomalous and looked

158
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,120
like they cross problems with theories.

159
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,160
And we will never know what went wrong,

160
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,640
because it's just too late to go back and check.

161
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,120
I'm sure we'll probably end up talking about some examples

162
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,620
later on.

163
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:08,100
But this Papa really never fully satisfactorily

164
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,260
answered this question of when it's OK to blame the apparatus

165
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,740
or other assumptions and when you should blame the theory.

166
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,020
I think he had an interesting substantive things to say,

167
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,140
but he didn't succeed in writing down what he was really

168
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,020
after, which was a kind of a systematic calculus,

169
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,700
if you like, for making these decisions.

170
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,660
Something that took these decisions out

171
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,820
of the hands of scientists who might be indulging

172
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,220
in motivated reasoning, you know,

173
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,820
trying to see their own theory in a good light

174
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,100
and just sort of said, no, you must follow this logic.

175
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,500
And this logic says your theory is wrong.

176
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,980
Yeah, because I haven't read his book,

177
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,940
where he introduced a principle, what's

178
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,860
it called, the logic of science, I believe.

179
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,860
But I don't think of scientific discovery, that's it.

180
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,740
Yeah, I haven't read that book, although my understanding,

181
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,140
again, at a very elementary level,

182
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,060
is that it seems that Papa really

183
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,420
wanted some kind of a priori principle or even theory

184
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,060
of science that allows scientists to do science.

185
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,740
And then what you would argue for, and many others,

186
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,620
would be that, oh, well, unfortunately,

187
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,060
for better or worse, let's say, we haven't found that.

188
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,900
Yeah.

189
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,940
And so what you, in fact, have is, you know,

190
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,500
I kind of made it all sound more like a philosophical argument.

191
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,780
But the fact of science, as you have real arguments

192
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,940
over these things, should whether probably

193
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,900
the result is just an artifact of some problem

194
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,980
with the measuring apparatus or the theory really

195
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,700
is in trouble.

196
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,940
In fact, that's almost more normal than any other state

197
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,440
of affairs.

198
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,860
So some typically scientists who perform the experiment

199
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,820
will trust the apparatus more than the scientists

200
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,940
sort of a few labs over who weren't there to kind of see

201
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,620
it all operating and so on.

202
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,820
And, you know, in the end, if scientists

203
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,940
keep going for long enough, there

204
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,220
does seem to be a kind of a consensus that forms.

205
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,060
The experiments get done enough times,

206
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,060
they're enough different people.

207
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,740
It's not as if we're just totally at sea,

208
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,900
but it doesn't have this simple, crisp, objective,

209
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,460
algorithmic feel to it that Papa was really reaching for.

210
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,420
Yeah, yeah.

211
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,420
Well, I guess that leads us to, I don't know if I should call

212
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,980
it the antithesis, but at least let's say,

213
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,900
well, juxtapose Thomas Kuhn's theory, the paradigm shift,

214
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,180
the term that he popularized, with the Popperian principle.

215
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,740
Yeah, so the structures of scientific revolutions,

216
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,060
perhaps my favorite book on philosophy of science,

217
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,460
yours is a healthy contender.

218
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:50,580
And so in contrast to Karl Popper, Professor Ravens,

219
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,940
how does Thomas Kuhn differ?

220
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,380
Because he came after Popper, isn't that right, Sam?

221
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,860
And what were his ideas?

222
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,540
Yeah.

223
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,540
So Papa wrote his book in the 1930s,

224
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,380
and Kuhn wrote his book in the 1960s to give you some sense.

225
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,580
So Popper is, in a way, essentially into war,

226
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,220
I suppose we would now say, and Kuhn is very much post-war.

227
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,260
And Popper was still firing on all cylinders by then,

228
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,900
but he wasn't presenting whole new ideas.

229
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,140
Well, he was entitled to have a break.

230
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,020
So Kuhn's idea is actually, it doesn't dispense

231
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,540
with the idea of a scientific method,

232
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,820
as I was saying earlier, but rather the idea

233
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,140
is that at any particular time period,

234
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,420
a science, say like particle physics or molecular genetics

235
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,500
or economics, maybe microeconomics,

236
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,260
will have a particular method, a particular set of rules

237
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,780
for doing science, and actually a rather comprehensive set

238
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,420
of rules for doing science.

239
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,900
But that these methods are not fixed for all time.

240
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,060
In fact, they change from time to time

241
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,100
in dramatic episodes called scientific revolutions,

242
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,060
or the phrase that Kuhn famously popularized for this

243
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,860
is our paradigm shift.

244
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,140
And the thing, the paradigm here,

245
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,460
is this kind of big method for doing science.

246
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,300
And when it shifts, that means the old paradigm

247
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,580
has crumbled, and a new one comes along and replaces it.

248
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,580
So whereas Papa and the sort of classic,

249
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,820
the classic searches for a scientific method,

250
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,980
we're looking for a single rule that is valid for all time.

251
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,460
As you said, hopefully our priority,

252
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,460
one that we can just know is right without, with certainty.

253
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,420
Kuhn thought these methods only last for a while,

254
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,780
and then their scientists actually pushed them

255
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,620
to the point where all of their flaws are exposed,

256
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,420
because they're actually, they're very rich,

257
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,820
but they're also kind of limited.

258
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,340
They have a lot of assumptions built in,

259
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,100
and inevitably some of those assumptions

260
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,700
will turn out to be wrong.

261
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,260
And so scientists pushed them to their breaking point.

262
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,020
And in effect, they destroy their own methods

263
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,300
by exposing the faulty assumptions or whatever.

264
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,180
And then some new method has to come along

265
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,020
and supplant the old method.

266
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,020
A new paradigm comes along and supplants the old paradigm.

267
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,060
That's a paradigm shift.

268
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,340
That's a scientific revolution.

269
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,500
Then you have a whole new methodological complex

270
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,060
governing what scientists do

271
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,060
in whatever area of science it is.

272
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,180
So in this way of paradigm shifting, would it be,

273
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,460
because it's not fair to say like, for instance,

274
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,660
from the Newtonian worldview of classical mechanics,

275
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,500
I'd say, to now with quantum theory, quantum mechanics,

276
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,020
is that really a paradigm shift,

277
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,340
or is a paradigm shift something where we have an epochal,

278
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,140
something like from Aristotelian science or physics

279
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,460
to what we have in modern science?

280
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,300
Because the reality is we still,

281
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,740
despite living now in the paradigm,

282
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,180
let's say, of quantum theory and quantum mechanics,

283
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,700
we still subscribe to certain Newtonian principles,

284
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,540
for sure, right?

285
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,580
And it's not like we've completely dismissed that.

286
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,060
So how did, yeah, perhaps maybe flesh out a bit more

287
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,940
what really is a paradigm shift.

288
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:19,140
Yeah, well, I think that the change that is most central

289
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,020
and to a paradigm shift, although it's not the only change,

290
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,460
is a change in a kind of a whole theoretical conception

291
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,580
of how the world works.

292
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,140
So although on the superficially quantum mechanics

293
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,620
or equally Einstein's general theory of relativity,

294
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,980
so that the kind of the successor theory

295
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,620
to Newton's work on gravitation in particular,

296
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,620
although that preserves a lot of what Newton said

297
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,380
in the sense of making the same predictions,

298
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,100
the theoretical underpinnings look really different.

299
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,220
So I'll do it with gravity.

300
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,860
In Newton, there's this force that objects

301
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,020
with mass exert on one another, they pull one another,

302
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,900
and that's gravity and it causes them to accelerate

303
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,260
and has spelled out by Newton's second law.

304
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,140
But in Einstein's theory that replaced Newton's theory,

305
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,300
there's no force directly between objects like that.

306
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Instead, objects impart this twist or curvature to space-time,

307
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,380
and then other objects are trying to travel

308
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,340
through that space-time, but because it's twisty,

309
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,260
they themselves take a curvy path,

310
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,140
which is just the path of, say, a body like the Earth

311
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,940
or between the sun.

312
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,460
Anyway, I probably shouldn't try to explain general,

313
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,620
I'd rather hear you put it, but the point is it's a really,

314
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,260
it's even though it makes a lot of the same predictions

315
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,700
as Newton's theory, which it had better do

316
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,140
because Newton's theory made so many correct predictions,

317
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,940
it's a really different way of thinking

318
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,300
about what's going on, and that's kind of at the core

319
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,220
of what makes it a new paradigm.

320
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,980
But it also suggests all of these new experiments

321
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,340
that just wouldn't make sense in Newton's theory.

322
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:13,300
So an example of that would be looking for the existence

323
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,660
of gravitational waves, Einstein's theory predicts,

324
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,580
because mass actually has an impact on space-time itself.

325
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,300
When you have, especially very dramatic events

326
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,260
like two colliding black holes,

327
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,740
where actually cause space-time itself to shiver,

328
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,820
like throwing a rock into a pool,

329
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,100
you get these waves that ripple outwards.

330
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,300
So you should be able to detect those

331
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,420
if you build a sensitive enough apparatus,

332
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,780
which physicists finally succeeded in doing

333
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,180
in about eight years ago.

334
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,020
I mean, they've been building it for about 50 years,

335
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,260
but it finally detected gravitational waves in 2015.

336
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,940
So you get all of these new ideas

337
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,700
about what you might do with science,

338
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,940
and that's characteristic of a paradigm shift.

339
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,460
It's not just a set of new theoretical ideas,

340
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,620
but all of these new ideas for actually doing science,

341
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,580
new kinds of experiments or observations

342
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
you could perform.

343
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,940
So that's what makes that shift from,

344
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,300
oh, you mentioned quantum mechanics,

345
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,180
and I kind of subtly changed the example just to gravity,

346
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,020
because it's, I think, a bit more straightforward.

347
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,540
Yeah, the question stands, yeah.

348
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,300
But the idea is it's the new paradigm managers

349
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,620
to do on the surface superficially

350
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,060
in terms of prediction and so on,

351
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,860
a lot of what the old paradigm did,

352
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,620
but it gives you a whole new picture

353
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,140
of the way the universe is working

354
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,500
that makes sense of those predictions.

355
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,340
Yeah, in fact.

356
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,980
Your method for doing science suggests

357
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,780
all of these new experiments you might do and so on.

358
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,260
Yeah, I was thinking of more of a contemporary example of this,

359
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,100
and I realized, I'm reading this book also by Tim Modellin,

360
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,420
the philosopher of science on quantum non-locality,

361
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,980
and there's an interesting kind of story of Einstein,

362
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,700
because John Bell, he mathematically proved quantum non-locality,

363
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,540
I believe in the 80s or 90s,

364
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,260
and then Tim Modellin, he's like one of his,

365
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,620
John Bell is like one of his heroes,

366
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,940
and then I believe in the Nobel Prize in Physics

367
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,580
was awarded to the laureates

368
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,460
who proved quantum non-locality,

369
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,340
it's mouthful, experimentally,

370
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,940
and then in the book he talks about how Einstein

371
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,460
didn't want to accept this idea of non-locality

372
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,460
because his theory was in fact local,

373
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,380
and he called it a spooky action at a distance,

374
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,660
but then of course now that we have mathematical proof

375
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,500
and empirical evidence, let's say,

376
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,260
which kind of sticks to your own rule of explanation,

377
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,500
it seems like we're kind of going through that paradigm shift

378
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,260
where, well, I guess physics isn't local anymore

379
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,860
in the way we thought,

380
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,860
and I find that endlessly fascinating

381
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,220
how it just completely shifts not only our theories,

382
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,540
but just even at a very essential level

383
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,900
how we view the world and experience the world.

384
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,100
Yeah, that's a great example of, again,

385
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,860
of a paradigm shift where you get this new kind of

386
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,180
fundamental, theoretical apparatus of quantum mechanics,

387
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,780
and that makes these weird predictions about non-locality,

388
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,260
and so it suggests this,

389
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,220
all of these scientific experiments you might do

390
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,860
that wouldn't have made any sense in Newtonian physics,

391
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,660
and in particular those Nobel Prize winning experiments

392
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,420
that really established that the predictions

393
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,820
of the theory really were accurate.
