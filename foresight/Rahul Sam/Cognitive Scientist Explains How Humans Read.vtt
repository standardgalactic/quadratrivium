00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
So the other bit is and what I love about the book is this is also in a way sort of like a book on

00:05.840 --> 00:13.360
on like social psychology because it's a lot on what laypeople believe and in fact being a layperson

00:13.360 --> 00:21.920
myself I kind of had this belief too for the longest time which is I've always equated what we call

00:22.000 --> 00:29.120
human language to reading and in the the blind story teller you state in page 203

00:29.760 --> 00:35.040
if you don't mind me reading it you say many people think of reading as a process of visual

00:35.040 --> 00:40.960
pattern recognition for example being able to consistently register the contrast between

00:40.960 --> 00:47.440
symmetrical letters such as D and B if that is the case then it stands to reason that when reading

00:47.440 --> 00:56.160
goes ori the culprit is a visual deficit but but in reality visual patterns are just a means to an

00:56.160 --> 01:03.040
end which is language reading is a technology that gets you there so uh professor if you could

01:03.040 --> 01:08.880
delineate what the difference between reading and languages uh that that would be great please

01:09.600 --> 01:14.320
so there are two things we need to explain what is reading and how it differs from language

01:14.320 --> 01:21.600
yes so the true theory what is the true science about and the second is what people think how this

01:21.600 --> 01:26.560
all works so there is the scientific theory and there is the intuitive theory which happens to

01:26.560 --> 01:34.080
be in disagreement and that's where we mess things up so um so there is a sense in which reading is

01:34.080 --> 01:40.640
very different from language um I often start my psychology of language classes uh by working really

01:40.640 --> 01:45.360
hard to disabuse not people of the notion that language and reading are the same thing they aren't

01:46.320 --> 01:51.840
language is natural you take every child they will develop language if you don't expose them to

01:51.840 --> 01:58.880
language they will grow one naturally even they're not exposed to a language um they do it naturally

01:58.880 --> 02:05.760
they don't need language lessons uh reading is not like that so most children if you don't teach

02:05.760 --> 02:10.400
them how to read explicitly they will never read there are tons of societies that they're doing

02:10.400 --> 02:17.440
just well without reading and writing um not so for language so language is universal to all human

02:17.440 --> 02:27.200
societies reading is not so they're divorced in this sense for sure nonetheless there is this

02:27.200 --> 02:34.400
interesting property of human brains that the neuroscientist Danislas de Han has pointed out

02:34.400 --> 02:42.720
which is when human brains come to invent a new system they don't invent it completely a new

02:43.440 --> 02:50.320
but rather what they do is recycle existing systems that are innate and kind of repurpose

02:50.320 --> 02:57.280
them for the new uh for this new purpose and the link between reading and language exactly

02:57.280 --> 03:05.760
follows those lines so when you look at how reading systems are designed they could have been

03:05.760 --> 03:11.200
completely divorced from language they could have been completely arbitrary but that's not the case

03:11.200 --> 03:18.880
because the letters that we use for a system like a phobetic system like English correspond to

03:18.960 --> 03:28.800
linguistic sounds for the most part um even in writing systems as in Mandarin it's true that there

03:28.800 --> 03:35.840
are visual origins of the symbols that they call they also have semantic component but eventually

03:35.840 --> 03:42.160
what they stand up for is also phonological sounds they spend they they stand for syllables

03:43.040 --> 03:49.920
so it turns out that when uh people come to invent language they kind of design it on the

03:49.920 --> 03:57.920
principles of how language works you can think about it in terms of human brains when they start

03:57.920 --> 04:03.680
processing language they start with the phonology and then so when you perceive speech that the

04:03.680 --> 04:09.280
first thing that you get is the sound structure of language and from there you proceed to syntax

04:09.280 --> 04:16.320
and so forth so it's like to go on the linguistic highway so to speak in the brain you need to start

04:16.320 --> 04:22.400
by having some phonological code so if you're trying to hijack the same highway to create

04:23.200 --> 04:31.360
reading you better start by doing by encoding phonology as well and that's how explain the

04:31.360 --> 04:38.000
correspondence between how reading works and how language works reading as a system is taking the

04:38.000 --> 04:45.200
language or or hijacking a component of the language system and repurposing it to for a new

04:45.840 --> 04:57.520
technology and that is why all reading systems that we know encode some phonological units at

04:57.520 --> 05:01.600
some level it doesn't necessarily need to be at the level of phonemes it could be syllables but

05:01.600 --> 05:09.200
there is also some phonological component there is ton of research that shows that when you and I

05:09.200 --> 05:14.320
read well I'm not a native speaker but when I read in my language and you read in your language

05:15.360 --> 05:23.120
even though we read silently we will automatically extract all this phonological component as

05:23.120 --> 05:28.560
integral part of the reading process so you think about reading as a visual affair it's something

05:28.640 --> 05:36.960
that happens only in your eyes of course it begins with the eyes but it looks like it invariably

05:36.960 --> 05:43.360
goes through the phonological system at some point or else reading does not work as it should

05:44.640 --> 05:50.400
so you must get some aspects of the phonology of what you read how do we know that because if

05:50.400 --> 05:57.920
you get two words that have the same phonology such as rose the flower and roses in two rows of

05:59.040 --> 06:06.560
chairs people confuse them all the time even if you'll have ROZE which is not the word people will

06:06.560 --> 06:13.440
also confuse them and using the proper experiments you can show that it's really the phonology that

06:13.440 --> 06:21.600
that confuses them which shows that people have consulted this information or else they would

06:21.600 --> 06:31.120
not have been confused so the point about showing how we stumble is to show how reading actually

06:31.120 --> 06:38.560
works and the fact that it actually works is using phonology it's using this part of language

06:38.560 --> 06:44.240
so that's the real theory of reading and we also know that when you know that the ability to perceive

06:44.240 --> 06:50.480
sounds is so it's not just phonology but also speech when the ability to perceive speech sounds

06:50.480 --> 06:57.440
is impaired this is a characteristic of dyslexia so people with dyslexia have problem with perceiving

06:57.440 --> 07:07.840
speech sounds now that's not that what laypeople think so if you ask a layperson you know johnny

07:07.840 --> 07:13.680
can't read here you know he's a six year old and he can't read what do you think is wrong with him

07:13.680 --> 07:19.280
and invariably people tell you there is something that's wrong with their eyes and if they think

07:19.280 --> 07:25.920
that there is something that's wrong with billy because of jimmy whatever i guess and that if the

07:25.920 --> 07:31.680
problem is congenital which we know that's the case in dyslexia that that um it is a congenital

07:31.680 --> 07:38.640
disorder people invariably think the problem can only be in the eyes it can't be the

07:38.720 --> 07:50.560
abstract phonological thing um this arises from this intuition that people hold that what's

07:50.560 --> 07:56.080
we hold innately so if you know that the problem is congenital that he was born with that then it

07:56.080 --> 08:03.120
must be somewhere in their body the people don't think just genes they think like in the eyes in

08:03.120 --> 08:09.600
the ears it can be something that is abstract that doesn't make sense that the ability to so what

08:10.400 --> 08:16.000
dyslexia really is about is in part the mechanism that allow you to map letters to sound and which

08:16.000 --> 08:22.160
is an abstract kind of cognitive mechanism and people have trouble recognizing that something

08:22.160 --> 08:32.880
like that could possibly be um involved or or or impaired innately so this is unfortunate because

08:32.880 --> 08:41.040
um it's uh first because people misunderstand what dyslexia is all about and and that's a problem

08:41.040 --> 08:46.800
because um if you think that you know if you have a child and you think that the only signal of

08:46.800 --> 08:55.120
dyslexia is switching letters then you will find fail to identify and and and um help these children

08:55.120 --> 09:02.800
with uh early as they need to as you need to um but indirectly it also tells you some something

09:02.800 --> 09:09.600
about how we think about what is innate and what is inateness and um uh and explain some of the

09:09.600 --> 09:16.720
other biases that I've shown in this book uh that show how our misconception about what

09:17.680 --> 09:27.440
about how what what is innate uh lead us to this crazy conclusion that what we know cannot possibly

09:27.440 --> 09:39.280
have an innate basis
