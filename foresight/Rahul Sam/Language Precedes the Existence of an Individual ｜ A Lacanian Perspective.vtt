WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
The part I sort of love most about your work

00:02.640 --> 00:07.640
is your teachings on the Lacanian perspective on language.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.280
So I kind of want to ask from you

00:11.280 --> 00:15.040
what the kind of meta psychology of Lacan

00:15.040 --> 00:19.320
tells us about human subjectivity apropos language.

00:19.320 --> 00:23.040
And if I may, I want to read out a short excerpt

00:23.040 --> 00:24.880
from your book, is that okay?

00:24.880 --> 00:27.400
Just on the topic of language.

00:27.400 --> 00:32.400
So on page 215, you say the autistic subjects in this case,

00:34.840 --> 00:36.800
there's no other as language for them.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.400
But then in the introduction,

00:38.400 --> 00:40.880
there's this really good excerpt that you give,

00:40.880 --> 00:42.560
which I love to be honest.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.280
It says, yeah, according to Lacan,

00:44.280 --> 00:48.480
language precedes the existence of an individual

00:48.480 --> 00:52.840
in the sense that if it exists before he or she is born

00:52.840 --> 00:56.720
and subsists after his or her death,

00:56.720 --> 01:00.200
as Fink emphasizes in his book, The Lacanian Subject,

01:00.200 --> 01:01.760
before a child is born,

01:01.760 --> 01:06.040
he or she is already endowed with a name as well

01:06.040 --> 01:08.440
as assigned with the personality,

01:08.440 --> 01:13.440
all of which are imagined by his or her parents

01:13.640 --> 01:17.240
through their use of signifiers.

01:17.240 --> 01:21.000
These signifiers used to endow the child

01:21.000 --> 01:25.400
with an existence in language are not uniquely invented

01:25.440 --> 01:29.280
by the parents, but are acquired from a symbolic order

01:29.280 --> 01:31.880
that has been accumulating for centuries

01:31.880 --> 01:34.800
preceding his or her conception.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.920
This system of signifiers is governed by a set of laws

01:38.920 --> 01:43.600
and is determined by Lacan as the other of language.

01:43.600 --> 01:47.240
And I was thinking if anyone needs

01:47.240 --> 01:49.600
kind of some kind of motivation to read more Lacan,

01:49.600 --> 01:51.760
this excerpt itself should be good enough,

01:51.760 --> 01:54.520
especially if you're interested in philosophy.

01:54.560 --> 01:58.200
So Leon, what is Lacan have to say about language

01:58.200 --> 02:01.560
and why in particular is language so important

02:01.560 --> 02:06.000
or I would say crucial for Lacanian psychoanalysis?

02:06.000 --> 02:09.760
Yes, you know, it is language that is important.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.400
And I'll just say it here,

02:14.400 --> 02:19.400
but it is the way that language impacts the body

02:21.560 --> 02:23.200
which is at stake.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.080
So we have to remember that.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.880
But let's get to it maybe when we continue

02:27.880 --> 02:32.240
and I'll just try and say this a common sensically.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.880
There's a certain idea

02:36.800 --> 02:39.400
that we might simplify by saying that

02:41.920 --> 02:46.920
when we look at, let's say, or organisms like humans,

02:47.920 --> 02:51.480
we clearly notice that our existence

02:51.480 --> 02:54.520
has a certain continuity to it.

02:54.520 --> 02:57.240
Many philosophers tried to think about this

02:57.240 --> 03:01.400
and I think John Locke had a certain idea

03:01.400 --> 03:04.000
of sort of a string of consciousness

03:04.000 --> 03:06.640
as long as the same consciousness remains there.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.760
So that I can say, I was here three months ago,

03:09.760 --> 03:12.560
it's still me, then we say,

03:13.560 --> 03:18.560
oh, there's a certain identity to this prolonged experience.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.640
But even prior to this question,

03:23.200 --> 03:26.240
in order to conceive of a certain continuation,

03:27.720 --> 03:30.560
a certain, let's say, relationship between

03:30.560 --> 03:32.720
what one experienced that point A

03:32.720 --> 03:35.840
and what one experiences today,

03:35.840 --> 03:38.600
we have to assume that something is,

03:38.600 --> 03:40.640
let's say, inscribed somewhere.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.560
I'll give you an example, a very simple one,

03:43.560 --> 03:48.560
let's say a camera has a lens and has some film.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.560
Now, if we take out the film,

03:52.560 --> 03:55.560
the camera, the lens will still see the world.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.040
The futons will still go through it.

03:58.040 --> 04:01.920
So things will be, let's say, perceived in the world.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.240
But in order for there to be a memory

04:04.240 --> 04:09.240
or to have a certain testimony to that thing that happened,

04:09.280 --> 04:12.800
we need a film, we need something to be written.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.240
So language for me, and I think for Lacan,

04:16.240 --> 04:18.600
it's this very essential thing.

04:18.600 --> 04:23.360
It is whatever is used to write, to inscribe.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.360
So in this sense, it is not the English language

04:25.360 --> 04:30.360
or the Farsi language or the Japanese language.

04:31.400 --> 04:35.680
It is whatever means one uses

04:35.680 --> 04:38.720
in order to inscribe something that remains.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.880
So it could be just something like this.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.200
We speak about it in many ways.

04:45.200 --> 04:49.520
Psychiatrists speak about it as sort of neuronal connections.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.280
It is a writing in the flesh.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.080
So this is language.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.320
Now, why language is so important for humans?

04:57.320 --> 04:59.920
And this is something that Lacan already says

04:59.920 --> 05:01.480
in his paper on the mirror stage.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.600
It's a very early paper.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.600
And he says, look, human beings are born underdeveloped.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.000
They're born half-paked.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.280
And you see it in comparison to other animals,

05:14.280 --> 05:15.520
some of which are born

05:15.520 --> 05:20.080
and just start roaming the world if we speak about,

05:20.080 --> 05:23.880
I don't know, insects or lizards or stuff like that.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.640
But also mammals, if you look at mammals,

05:26.640 --> 05:28.440
they are born, they can start walking,

05:28.440 --> 05:31.560
they can start sniffing, many of them.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.240
So when we think about the organism

05:34.240 --> 05:38.200
and sort of the hard-wired level of the instinct,

05:39.120 --> 05:43.400
for many animals, these instincts are sufficient

05:43.400 --> 05:47.000
for them to exist in a world, in their world,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.360
from the moment of birth.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.360
But for humans, this is not the case.

05:51.360 --> 05:54.240
Our instincts, all the things that we are born with

05:54.240 --> 05:57.040
instinctually are completely insufficient

05:57.040 --> 05:59.200
for our survival in the beginning.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.360
A baby cannot do anything, basically.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.440
And without the caretaker,

06:04.440 --> 06:08.840
there will not be any chance for survival.

06:09.920 --> 06:14.920
So we say that the baby is in the womb, let's say.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.920
The baby has a need and these needs are answered.

06:19.920 --> 06:23.840
But as soon as the baby is born, it might be hungry,

06:23.840 --> 06:28.360
it might be, I don't know, it might need a diaper change,

06:28.360 --> 06:31.880
but this does not happen automatically, immediately.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.240
So we say that after birth,

06:34.240 --> 06:37.440
there is necessarily a certain lack

06:37.440 --> 06:40.880
that is presented in the child's libidinal economy.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.000
Something is needed, but it's not satisfied.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.680
Let's say, mom is at the toilet, dad is not here,

06:46.680 --> 06:48.200
the child is hungry.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.480
Now the child is not fed immediately.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.960
What the child has to do is to take on itself

06:55.960 --> 07:00.440
a certain representation that is linguistic

07:00.440 --> 07:03.560
and address it to another person.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.520
So this is the cry, the baby cries

07:06.520 --> 07:11.520
and then the parent starts to guess what is at stake

07:12.160 --> 07:14.600
and then maybe the baby is fed.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.200
But what you see here is the fact

07:16.200 --> 07:20.800
that language is necessary in order to,

07:20.800 --> 07:24.960
let's say, compensate for this inherent

07:25.160 --> 07:28.800
born gap between the level of the instinct

07:28.800 --> 07:32.720
and the world for the human baby.

07:32.720 --> 07:37.720
Humans are born into a reality where our instincts

07:38.360 --> 07:41.880
and our, let's say, reality, our human reality,

07:41.880 --> 07:46.880
the humanized world are in a complete separation.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.760
There's a schism.

07:50.840 --> 07:52.600
And the only way to connect them

07:52.600 --> 07:56.920
to gain access to this world is by addressing an other,

07:56.920 --> 08:00.200
using a language that is not mine.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.760
This language is used to inscribe something

08:05.760 --> 08:08.960
in this gap between the instinctual level

08:08.960 --> 08:10.760
and the humanized world.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.480
And let's say this inscription

08:13.480 --> 08:16.560
and the way that languages use to inscribe

08:17.800 --> 08:21.280
is what we might identify in the clinic

08:21.280 --> 08:22.600
as a clinical structure.

08:23.640 --> 08:28.640
So everyone relies on language to attempt to compensate

08:28.680 --> 08:32.760
for an inherent gap, an inherent schism,

08:32.760 --> 08:37.000
inherent split in every human's existence.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.760
And we use language in different ways

08:38.760 --> 08:40.560
in order to compensate for it.

08:40.560 --> 08:43.120
No one is able to bridge this gap.

08:43.120 --> 08:47.440
There is no one that lives in nirvana, sadly,

08:48.520 --> 08:50.720
in a place where it is true.

08:50.720 --> 08:55.600
The inner world and the environment are in complete

08:55.600 --> 08:56.480
unicity.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.240
There is no such thing only in our fantasies.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.600
So everyone uses language in a different way to do it.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.080
And what Freud was identifying,

09:04.080 --> 09:06.640
I think in his beginning on his work,

09:06.640 --> 09:09.200
is these particular ways

09:09.200 --> 09:11.960
that people use language in order to compensate.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.080
And he was saying, look at this,

09:13.080 --> 09:15.920
this is the neurotic way to compensate

09:15.920 --> 09:20.040
for this inherent schism in human existence.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.240
This is the psychotic way

09:22.240 --> 09:24.360
to compensate for this inherent schism.

09:24.360 --> 09:28.680
And what I argue in my book is that there is an autistic way

09:28.680 --> 09:31.600
to compensate for this inherent schism.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.120
I go to great lengths to describe it

09:35.120 --> 09:37.160
because I think it is very different

09:37.160 --> 09:40.440
from the neurotic and psychotic way.

09:40.440 --> 09:44.400
And I say that it is different to such an extent

09:44.400 --> 09:48.400
that it necessitates a different clinical approach.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.920
And this is why I say that autism is distinct,

09:50.920 --> 09:52.440
is a distinct structure.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.400
Because I'm basically saying,

09:54.400 --> 09:58.280
when we work with particular subjects

09:58.280 --> 10:01.840
that compensate for this schism using language

10:01.840 --> 10:03.480
in a particular way,

10:03.480 --> 10:06.480
we have to situate ourselves in the transference

10:06.480 --> 10:07.480
in a different way.
