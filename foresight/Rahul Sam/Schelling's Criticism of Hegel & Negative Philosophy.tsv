0	7200	What I see from your White Hellion work, Matt, is that in contrast to, let's say Peter Rollins or
7200	12800	even Jack, kind of the apathetic theology, it seems so much of their theology is focused on
12800	18720	negativity and probably makes sense given their Hegelians, the negative aspect of God or like
18720	24320	the self-divided God. Whereas I do see, and it's in many ways, you know, in like our kind of like
24320	31120	post-modern kind of culture, this is a breath of fresh air that Whitehead, he in fact, he asserts,
31120	37520	he puts forward a positive philosophy through especially the ideas of like creativity and
37520	45840	imagination, which is a big thing for you. So, well, what really is that kind of positive orientation
45840	52640	in Whiteheadian process theology, would you say, in contrast to more of the kind of the negative
52640	58960	apathetic theology that we hear more from the Jackians in our times?
61280	66080	I think, you know, it's very, I don't know if this is intentional on your part or if you know
66080	73280	much about Shelling's positive philosophy, which was his late philosophical contribution at the
73280	80320	University of Berlin after Hegel's death, where, you know, this connects to process theology
80320	84560	and Whitehead's work as well, where Shelling basically looked back at his own earlier work
85360	92880	and the work of Hegel and criticized it as a form of negative philosophy, which
94080	101760	was merely conceptual. And if it were to have been more upfront about the fact that it's merely
101760	108240	conceptual, it wouldn't be a problem. But he thinks, you know, he's very critical in particular
108240	114160	of Hegel's attempt to transition from the logic to the philosophy of nature, where there's this
114160	120480	sense in which the logic just freely releases itself into actual existence. And, you know,
120480	133360	Shelling just didn't see how one could make that transition from the process of negation by which
133360	143280	this dialectical logic could unfold to actual positive existence. And, you know, Kierkegaard was
143280	149360	at Shelling's late lectures, and many of Kierkegaard's critiques of Hegel come straight out of
149360	158240	Shelling's late criticisms. And what Shelling wanted to offer as a remedy to this situation,
158240	163120	because he admitted his own earlier philosophy was also a negative philosophy in the sense that it,
163120	174000	you know, was relying too much on the conceptual activity of negation
176080	182800	in an attempt to derive actual knowledge, where what Shelling wanted to seek in his late philosophy
182800	191600	was a more existential relationship to actual existence. And he called it a kind of metaphysical
191600	200320	empiricism, where we're not so much concerned with what the structure, the conceptual structure
200320	210000	of reality is. We're more concerned with the fact that anything exists at all. And, you know, he says
210000	216400	that the fact that anything exists at all cannot be explained rationally would be his claim that
216400	227040	there's something unprethinkable or un-oprioriable about just the sheer fact of existence. And so,
227040	232800	I mean, I think we can safely say that existentialism is kind of born in these late lectures of Shelling's.
235360	238000	And, you know, he also frames this as a kind of
238880	247440	critique of feeling, Shelling does. And he says, he makes this interesting comment. I think I
247440	254320	mentioned it in my book about how Yakkant tried to do in his third critique, this examination,
254320	264720	a transcendental examination of feeling and esthesis and so on. But, you know, he didn't follow
264720	269200	through fully and he discovered things in that final critique of judgment, as I said earlier,
269200	275360	about the living world, but also about aesthetics and our relationship to the sublime and so on,
275360	281520	that in many ways undermined some of the systematic claims he made in his first critique.
283360	288000	And so, you know, Shelling just drops this hint about that we still need a critique of feeling.
288640	293360	And Whitehead later in Process and Reality, I don't, I'm pretty sure, I'm almost certain he
293360	298240	didn't read these late lectures of Shelling's. I know he had read at least some excerpts of Shelling's
298800	304000	in a book by a Russian philosopher named Velosky, so he was aware of Shelling.
304960	309520	But he almost certainly didn't read these late lectures on positive philosophy.
309520	316960	But Whitehead says, again, in response to Kant, that he wants to replace this critique of pure
316960	322960	reason with a critique of pure feeling. And his whole process philosophy is an attempt
323760	327520	to do so. And he also says, you know, in the first critique of pure reason,
327520	334720	Kant has these 20 pages on the transcendental aesthetic, where he, you know, articulates
334720	340160	his view of space and time as forms of our own intuition. And Whitehead says,
341040	348000	his whole book should have been about that, and not just this quick little 20 page aside.
349760	352640	You mentioned crossing the threshold, yeah.
352640	359920	Yeah, exactly. And so, you know, and then basically Whitehead's philosophy of organism
359920	363520	in the final interpretation ends up being a lot like absolute idealism,
363760	367600	in terms of the relationship between God and the world and the human
369360	378800	self-consciousness and the divine. But as he himself puts it, he's putting
380960	385760	philosophy on a realistic basis instead of an idealistic basis, because he's not
386880	392400	doing philosophy in an attempt to build up this hierarchy of categories of thought,
392400	400160	he says, but rather a hierarchy of feeling. And once to root all of our human knowing,
401360	411760	thinking activity and our knowledge in a kind of, I think of him as basically saying that knowledge
411760	418080	itself is a form of feeling. Our conceptual activity, conceptual prehension in his terms,
418080	422480	is a form of feeling, just we're feeling possibilities rather than feeling actualities.
423120	427360	And so he wants to put reason and mind back in the world, back in the body,
428240	434400	and put the body back in the context of a living universe. And so in this context, you know, positive
435440	442400	philosophy is another way of thinking about this recharged form of empiricism.
443200	448560	Shelling called it metaphysical empiricism. William James, very influential for Whitehead,
448560	456160	called it radical empiricism, where it's not that Whitehead wasn't aware of the importance
457120	468560	of negation in the context of logical dialectics, but he accepts this pragmatist critique of
468560	475920	idealistic philosophy and really wants our concepts to be adequate to experience and
476720	482320	applicable to experience and, yeah, pragmatically useful. And like the test of any concept
482880	487200	for Whitehead is, well, to what extent does it elucidate our experience, including our practical
487200	495920	experience? So, yeah, hopefully, hopefully that gets at this question of the shift from the negative
495920	500160	to the positive. Most certainly does, most certainly does. And in fact, just to answer your
500160	506960	question, Matt, but I'm aware of Shelling's late lectures. The answer is no, because my only
506960	512640	education of Shelling is from Frederick Beyser, and this great guy on the internet called Footnotes
512640	518000	to Play Doh. So I need to, I probably need to, well, do you know what those lectures are called?
518000	523600	I just, I just, I may just call Shelling's late lectures or? The grounding of positive
523600	529760	philosophy. I mean, so only, only, only some of those lectures have been translated up to this
529760	535360	point into English. I don't know if you read German. I don't, I don't, I'm working on it,
535360	542720	but I don't, I don't yet have the ability to really study the original. But SUNY, the State
542720	549680	University of New York has published a lot of Shelling's late lectures. And under the title,
549680	555520	The Grounding of Positive Philosophy, Bruce Matthews is the translator. They've also,
555520	562800	SUNY has published some of his Philosophy of Mythology. I think it's under the title,
562800	565840	The Historical Critical Introduction to the Philosophy of Mythology.
569120	573440	So that's what's available in English at this point. Yeah. And these, these were all lectures
573440	579920	he gave in the University of Berlin beginning in 1841, I believe. Yeah.
580560	589360	Excellent. Excellent. If I could find that, I'll leave a link down below in the description.
