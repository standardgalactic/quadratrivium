0	8000	Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the Interrealm Podcast, and in this one I'll be reading a piece of my writing.
8000	19000	So, like every other overly and sometimes unwarrantedly, opinionated person on the internet, I too started a newsletter.
19000	27000	It's called The Unhappy Man, and despite the dramatic, histrionic title of the newsletter, The Unhappy Man,
27000	33000	it's essentially the same as what I talk about in this podcast.
33000	43000	I try to cover philosophy with a heavy emphasis on phenomenology, existentialism, and of course religion, because those are the topics that I'm interested in.
43000	51000	I didn't want to separate it from what I create here on the podcast, because I don't even know if that's possible, because it's me who's creating.
51000	57000	It's my perspective, it's me who's engaging with these topics and with these subjects.
57000	71000	And one thing I did though is I wrote a couple of axioms for the newsletter, and as I was laying down my points and sort of delineating what the details of these axioms are,
71000	81000	I realized, wow, I'm pretty much setting up a framework for all of my creative work, and it only makes sense to read them out here in the podcast,
81000	89000	because as I do release the axioms, I think there are six axioms, I'll be following them for the podcast too.
89000	96000	So, since this podcast is still in its nascent forms, just starting off, it's a good...
96000	118000	I just thought it was a good idea to set some ground rules, so to speak, even though not ground rules in a tyrannical sense, rather more of a framework to prevent myself from getting lost in abstractions and nebulous ideas, so to speak.
118000	134000	Now, I'm not going to read the whole introduction to the newsletter, this was the first piece that I sent out, rather I'd focus purely on the first axiom that I shared, and I did already share a couple other axioms, I'll be reading them out in the upcoming episodes.
135000	158000	But of course, I can't deny, or I can't help myself to not read one of my favorite poems by Reina Marelka, because this poem is kind of like... it kind of heralds me in what I do, it's my guiding light, and I love it so much, I've read it to so many people,
158000	171000	and so, what better way to start off this episode than other than reading this great poem by Reina Marelka, and it goes like this...
189000	212000	Go to the limits of your longing, embody me, flare up like a flame, and make big shadows I can move in, let everything happen to you, beauty and terror, just keep going, no feeling is final, don't let yourself lose me,
212000	221000	nearby is the country they call life, you will know it by its seriousness, give me your hand.
223000	236000	And I've said, it's with such intent, I orient myself in starting this newsletter, and I might add, it's with the same intent, that I orient myself in this podcast.
237000	244000	Having said that, without spending too much time on a unnecessarily prolonged introduction, let me get to the guiding axioms.
245000	255000	Your audacity to write about the human experience seems like a ludicrous endeavor, due to its uncanny ubiquity from poetry to quantum mechanics.
255000	265000	I might as well say I'm writing a newsletter about everything and anything that could ever be written about, which becomes meaningless due to its nebulousness.
266000	276000	Hence, to contain my propensity to wander off into senseless obscurity and out of respect for the reader, or in this case, for the listener,
276000	288000	I'll outline in no particular order of importance and share these guiding axioms for the unhappy man or the inner realm podcast in the next few weeks.
289000	304000	I do want to add, before I start off on the first axiom, I think as you did notice from that first para, I'm setting these up more for myself than for anyone else, if I'm being honest.
304000	318000	Because I do know I have the problem of wandering off into obscurity and not sticking to the point, and that can be very, very frustrating when trying to consume.
319000	323000	Sometimes coherence and eloquence matters a lot.
323000	339000	So that's why I poured it's important for me to share these axioms in the podcast, but also in some way, reiterate the framework I want to work through when I'm creating content or when I'm writing.
340000	346000	Starting off with the first one, axiom number one, which is the only one that I'll be reading out today.
347000	352000	Restrain the urge to overcome unhappiness with ideological prescription.
354000	361000	Like love, ideology is blind. Even if people caught up in it are not. Slavo Žižek.
362000	374000	We face the pressure of meaning. Kemu was right when he said, man stands face to face with irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason.
375000	383000	The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.
384000	396000	Our predicament lies not in the meaninglessness of the universe, but that from all the sentient beings, we are the only ones that yearn for meaning in this desolate place.
397000	405000	If God created man not to desire meaning, then the meaninglessness of life wouldn't be a tribulation.
406000	421000	In that sense, God is more malevolent than we can ever imagine, because he not only allows unreasonable suffering, but even plays that lonesome trick on humanity by creating meaning, desiring beings and a meaningless world.
421000	432000	Therefore, our penchant for becoming ideologues, for finding psychic stability through the prescription and imposition of dogmas onto the world is unsurprising.
433000	447000	The profound unhappiness this angst brings to our souls makes our capitulation to totalitarian ideologies, for example Marxism, capitalism, religious fundamentalism, etc. understandable.
448000	453000	Such facts of a human heart have to be acknowledged and dealt with at infinitum.
453000	462000	But on that legubrious note, I ought to specify that ideology doesn't intend to seek truth, nor does it increase human freedom.
463000	470000	Ideology exists for its own sake, for its perpetuation, it's a sanitary and nothingness.
471000	480000	So I will ardently interdict my natural desire to make this newsletter, or this podcast, a forum for ideological evangelism.
481000	488000	Pause, I apologize, I hope I didn't ruin the flow of the essay, but I did realize that I didn't mention something quite important.
488000	493000	If you do want to subscribe to the newsletter, the link is down below in the description.
493000	508000	As you probably have noticed, I did skip a whole lot of paras in the introduction, only because I want to focus purely on the axioms in this podcast, as if you want to read the whole newsletter, just go and subscribe to it.
509000	511000	But yeah, I just want to mention that point.
512000	515000	Alright, back to it, I really hope I didn't kill the flow.
516000	523000	To write or live for that matter, authentically and non-ideologically, is the strangest of all things.
524000	530000	In many ways, it's being the quintessential struggle to be an individual since time immemorial.
531000	541000	And apart from authenticity being an existential predicament, modern society seems to hinder us from even raising questions about authentic living.
542000	552000	For instance, contemporary culture reeks of the call for constant deliberation, self-expression, and bringing one's true self to the world.
553000	560000	Yet, as some Frankfurt School sociologists, namely Adorno, Hochheimer and Herbermas, propose,
560000	568000	industrial bureaucratized society allows us only to be free within the confines of the ruling ideology.
569000	575000	And freedom itself is a tool used to coax an individual to submit to the establishment.
576000	590000	They argued in the 1940s, popular culture does its best through the cultural goods of mass media, film, music, and commercialized sports that make people docile, passive consumers.
591000	600000	For them, a true miracle would be if one of the NFL Super Bowl commercials said, you don't need another pair of shoes to be happy.
600000	612000	Through this critical lens, even the ostensible social justice messaging, like the direct championing for liberation and equality, is a facade for ideological control.
613000	622000	Case in point, telling a woman to be a boss bait, or a CEO, is simply the prevailing capitalist ideology telling her what to become.
623000	646000	The establishment tells her to partake in a company that's yet another overpriced fashion brand, telling young girls to find their self-esteem and work as an individual through owning some product, leading to further exacerbation of the anxiety and insecurity we see in teenagers, especially girls, prevalent these days.
647000	655000	Most of this happens subconsciously, unbeknownst to us, but vis-à-vis women's empowerment.
656000	663000	A donor would ask, how this would be true freedom? How does this allow an individual to be authentic?
663000	679000	In Marxist parlance, he manages to bridge commodity finishization with reification, where such a woman has forfeited her inner freedom by committing to objects, i.e. fashion products outside herself.
680000	696000	She's made the object a subject, while relinquishing her subjectivity. This is the case only if the subject-object economy is true. Nevertheless, the existential point of losing one's inner-ness still stands.
697000	709000	Such control is worse than overt despotism of an authoritarian regime, as in our case, we don't even know we are being controlled and how our psyche is changing as a result of it.
709000	717000	Having said that, I doubt even being aware of this stadium allows one to be truly authentic if such a thing exists.
718000	731000	For instance, a donor was scathing the critical of contemporary Western culture and its concomitant cultural goods, especially the burgeoning Americanism with its jazz music.
731000	741000	No, that wasn't a typo. He, in fact, hated jazz. Simply put, footnote, I've greatly simplified and reduced his arguments here for brevity's sake.
741000	755000	You can read his original paper on jazz for the particularities or connecustics, a donor's philosophy of music, which a neophyte like myself would find more palatable.
755000	776000	Simply put, he thought jazz was a true art, but rather a banal commodity that chained people's spirits to the capitalist machine. It was merely aesthetically pleasing, in contrast to so-called serious art produced by high culture like Mozart, which penetrated and changed one's soul fundamentally.
776000	793000	In typical leftist thinking for a donor, true art makes us question our bland comforts, conformism, ignorance, and subservience to the prevailing dogmas. Art cannot be simply enjoyed for its own sake.
793000	807000	Art ought to transform a man by none. As he states in aesthetic theory, art respects the masses by confronting them as that which they could be rather than conforming to them in their degraded state.
807000	813000	But who's to say that he too isn't in this degraded state, along with the rest of us?
814000	825000	Perhaps a donor is evading his true inner self by indulging in higher culture and intellectual life, where his authentic self never comes to light.
825000	851000	Anna Freud expounds on this phenomenon in a psychoanalytical theory of defense mechanisms. She highlights how our unconscious users of a variety of defenses, sublimation, rationalization, intellectualization, etc., to name a few, as an outlet for protecting our ego to avoid distressing, excited-producing thoughts and internal conflicts about our own life.
851000	865000	So being in a steeped, immersing oneself in serious intellectual work, learning new languages, and traveling the world to experience cultures all seem like objects our subjective defense mechanisms exploit.
865000	876000	No different from engaging in mindless consumerism or superficial capitalistic accumulation of wealth solely for the sake of accumulation.
876000	878000	Footnote
879000	886000	While it seems like I'm making a relativistic argument about one's life choices, I'm not.
886000	895000	One could undoubtedly make a qualitative distinction between different modes of life, but perhaps not intellectually.
895000	911000	For instance, I'd say it's qualitatively better to learn a new language and broaden one's worldview than to buy yet another luxury watch that has a price tag that's equivalent to the cost of feeding a whole village.
911000	926000	It's better to read philosophy and literature over watching Married at Versailles. It's better to travel and experience different cultures than doing vodka shots to the point of passing out on weekends.
926000	938000	Or as Wither D. Scutter wrote, creation is a better means of self-expression than possession. It is true creating, not possessing, that life is revealed.
938000	949000	Having said that, while distinct individual decisions could be qualitatively compared and judged, the essence of two individuals can never be.
949000	958000	As to be an individual is infinitely deeper and multifaceted than one's temporal choices, the fragments can't replace the whole.
958000	963000	Kerkregard elucidates the essence of this datum, best in either role.
963000	974000	Wherein attempting to outline a theory of human existence, he intimates how we all inescapably live a transient aesthetic life.
974000	978000	The life of celebrating constant change and titillation.
978000	981000	The life of desire and sensuousness.
981000	984000	The life of immediacy and aesthetic reflection.
984000	992000	This is in contradiction to the ethical life Kerkregard's judge Wilhelm delineates in his letters to the esteemed.
992000	997000	For the person who lives aesthetically sees only possibilities everywhere.
997000	1006000	For him, it is these that form the content of the future, whereas the person who lives ethically sees tasks everywhere.
1006000	1018000	And yet, in his moral phenomenology, one could argue for a subtler reading to find that even the ethical societal and civic duty collapses to the aesthetic.
1018000	1022000	As it becomes motivated by self-fulfillment.
1022000	1029000	To do good because goodness makes one happy is nevertheless one's ethical passions and effect.
1029000	1034000	And ultimately, the highest stage of life for Kerkregard is the religious fear.
1034000	1038000	Beyond the binary of the aesthetic and the ethical.
1038000	1042000	When one arrives here, an inner metaphysical phenomenon occurs.
1042000	1052000	In his temporality, one makes an absolute unconditional commitment to the ground of all being that transcends logical reasoning.
1052000	1055000	The prevalent ethics and social norms of the day.
1055000	1069000	We see this radical transposition epitomized in Dostoevsky's crime and punishment where, towards the end of the novel, the protagonist Raskolnikov simply accepts his role without any explanation.
1069000	1074000	And perhaps we see this in figures like Martin Luther King Jr. too.
1074000	1084000	They've come in touch with a self-transcending, deeper reality beyond coherent truth itself that's scandalous to human reason.
1084000	1093000	Having gone on the tangential point in the spirit of authenticity, I have to admit that I've never experienced this latter religious stage.
1093000	1096000	Kerkregard writes off with such zeal.
1096000	1101000	Nor am I sure if I won't do after having read Fear and Trembling.
1101000	1107000	My life has been a constant oscillation between the aesthetic and the ethical.
1107000	1116000	Even reading and writing about the religious life is an intellectual thrill for me rather than a sincere expedition for truth.
1116000	1118000	Kant wrote, paraphrasing,
1118000	1121000	If truth shall kill them, let them die.
1121000	1125000	But then I wonder if any of us really see truth.
1125000	1130000	If truth made us miserable to the point of suicide, would we want it?
1130000	1137000	The problem, as Nietzsche wrote, is that no one has yet been truthful enough about what truthfulness is.
1137000	1143000	The fundamental epistemic confusion will always make ideology attractive to us.
1143000	1145000	And perhaps we can never abandon it.
1145000	1153000	A chance true authenticity lies in thinking less of being authentic, of trying to be in a particular stage of life,
1153000	1156000	whether it be aesthetic, ethical or religious,
1156000	1165000	rather simply discovering reality without expectations or suppositions, if such a thing is possible.
1165000	1173000	Much like happiness, the more one thinks of being authentic, the less of one's true self one becomes.
1173000	1182000	Ergo, I will write non-telelogically, non-prescriptively, but also not merely descriptively,
1182000	1189000	as writing or recording a podcast in this case always has a point of view, a perspective.
1189000	1197000	In that regard, I can only try to allow what I read and write to seize me than I try to seize it.
1197000	1202000	Thanks for listening, I hope you found me sharing this axiom useful,
1202000	1208000	and perhaps you got an intimation of what's to come in this podcast.
