0	4160	Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the NRLN podcast.
4160	9520	I shall continue what I've been doing in the previous episodes where I read out these guiding
9520	15440	axioms that I laid down for my newsletter, The Unhappy Man, and in case you didn't watch the
15440	24240	previous episodes to repeat the same old introduction, sort of ad nauseam, I laid down
24320	29120	seven axioms for my writing for the newsletter and in the middle of it I realized, oh wow,
29840	35360	what I'm writing here, it's not just for the newsletter, in fact it's sort of a framework for
35360	41360	all of my creative work and this podcast certainly is a part of what I consider to be my creative
41360	46960	work so it just makes sense to read out these axioms so that, you know, since the podcast just
46960	56000	started and if you're a new variable listener, whatever you may be, you'll see where I'm coming at
56000	62160	when I'm trying to produce content for the podcast, not just my monologues or my pieces,
64640	70240	even the interviews I hope to do through the axioms that I've been laying down.
70240	76400	And today's axiom is axiom number three. If you did miss the other two, please go and watch them.
76480	80080	It's part of the playlist, it's all on the YouTube channel on Spotify.
81040	89120	But without further ado, let's get started. The guiding axiom number three for the unhappy man,
89120	93920	for the inner realm podcast, for all of my creative work is, and this is very, very important,
93920	98640	I wrote this with a lot of passion, I would say. It's something that's very, very close to my heart.
99600	102320	Never mistake cynicism for wisdom.
106640	112000	In Dostoevsky's Kraman punishment, Raskolnikov has a point when he says,
112960	115600	pain and suffering are always inevitable.
117920	124720	For a large intelligence and a deep heart, the really great men must, I think, have a great sadness
124720	134320	on earth. Perhaps it's true that men of higher intellectual acuity are more aware of the world's
134320	141840	tragedy and folly. So their contempt for the deluded masses who are lost in superficial vanity
141840	148080	and worldly self-indulgence probably has some warrant. But I wonder if those ancient critiques
148080	155280	with their eruditeness and polemical virtuosity tend to fall in love with their own ingenious.
155280	161120	In truth, the highbrows rarely believe about themselves what Socrates declared of himself.
162160	170240	I neither know nor think I know. Most casual, critical philosophizing is merely one's
170240	174800	cynicism being projected onto the world masquerading as wisdom.
175520	181120	The only thing worse than a cynic is an accompanying sharp intellect to tantalize
181120	187920	a cynicism. For instance, if we take happiness, something elusive for us humans, such a person
187920	195200	refuses to believe that someone could be genuinely happy in this world, and is dismissive or even
195200	200960	hates anyone trying to do so. Let's see a man who's sincerely endeavoring to make something of
201920	207760	himself as merely a show, one puts on to please the cultural overlords,
207760	214720	pusillanimously and slavishly living by an emasculating moral duty. For the cynic,
214720	221600	the ordinary person, playing his part as a steadfast citizen, fulfilling his responsibilities
221600	227040	towards his family, paying his dues to the divine, without overtly theologizing God,
227040	232640	and maybe even volunteering at a homeless shelter once in a while is all but puppetry.
233440	239680	The cynic sneers at all of this effort and says it's all futile and only for the credulous.
239680	246320	They are in utter disbelief of sincerity and anyone striving towards the good. In their
246320	252800	enlightenment state, they think of themselves as being beyond the trivialities of ordinary life and
252800	259200	basic morality, despite being willing to even suffer for their cynical ideologies.
260560	265840	But the irony is that a cynic is critical of everything and anything but their hubristic
265840	272080	cynicism. The cynical attitude of the heart always comes first and the rationalization second.
272640	279280	Whenever I encounter a cynic, which sometimes is someone I meet within my own soul, I'm reminded
279280	287680	of what G.K. Chesterton wrote about the new rebel in orthodoxy. But the new rebel is a skeptic
287680	294480	and will not entirely trust anything. He has no loyalty, therefore he can never be really a
294480	301360	revolutionist. And the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants
301360	307200	to denounce anything. For all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind,
307840	313520	and the modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces, but the doctrine by
313520	320640	which he denounces it. Thus he writes one book complaining that imperial oppression insults
320640	327040	the purity of women and then he writes another book about the sex problem in which he insults it
327040	334160	himself. He curses a sultan because christian girls lose their virginity and then curses
334160	341120	Mrs. Grandi because they kept it. As a politician, he would cry out that war is a waste of life and
341120	348320	then as a philosopher that all of life is a waste of time. A russian pessimist will denounce a policeman
348320	353120	for killing a peasant and then proved by the highest philosophical principles that the peasant
353120	361760	ought to have killed himself. A man denounces marriage as a lie and then denounces aristocratic
361760	367600	profligates for treating it as a lie. He calls a flag a bubble and then blames the oppressors of
367600	374000	poland or island because they take away that bubble. The man of this school goes first to a
374000	380160	political meeting where he complains that savages are treated as if they were beasts, then he takes
380160	386400	his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting where he proves that they practically
386400	394480	are beasts. In short, the modern revolutionist being an infinite skeptic is always engaged
394480	403360	in undermining his own minds. In his book on politics, he attacks men for trampling on morality.
403360	409440	In his book on ethics, he attacks morality for trampling on men. Therefore, the modern man
409440	415840	in revolt has practically become useless for all purposes of revolt. A rebelling against
415840	422240	everything, he has lost a right to rebel against anything. So before I do read out my commentary
422240	428480	on that paragraph, the good thing about doing a podcast is I can sort of impromptuly add notes
428480	434560	and ancillary points to reading the essay. So think of this as more of a footnote. A lot of people
434560	440240	think of Chesterton as being a typical orthodox conservative kind of thinker and theologian,
441120	448240	but I wouldn't necessarily simplify him to that level. I think he's a much deeper,
448240	455760	profound thinker than merely someone defending the orthodoxy. So in that spirit,
455760	462480	I read him and in that spirit, I wrote this little bit as a commentary on what I just read.
463200	470720	To explicate his sentiments, Chesterton writes not of his averseness or disdain of the
470720	479040	revolutionary, but of the rebel who's a cynic, where his ideological affiliations merely a projection
479760	487520	of an essential spiritual attitude. And the problem with the cynicism is that it becomes a lazy way
487600	493840	to opt out of life. Echoing a more contemporary religious thinker, Jordan Pearson's sentiments,
494720	500560	we're met with an ultimate outlook on life. Either everything wonders matters, which comes
500560	506640	with the concomitant and crushing burden of responsibility. The striving man chooses his
506640	513840	path and recognizes that his striving, no matter how arduous and demanding, is meaningful and necessary.
514800	519920	Or the other is nothing matters, therefore one refuses to partake in life.
521200	527440	This man is super-seriously contemptuous of the striving man and his so-called higher virtues,
528960	534400	which is too simple and naive. It's only a matter of time when such a person's cynicism
534400	541760	becomes resentment and they've created hell for themselves. He'd say better to be a king in hell
541760	547120	than a slave in heaven. Funnily enough, I've begun to notice the latter type in the more cerebral
547120	553840	intellectual types. But that's a whole other conversation. In any case, existential apathy
553840	560160	and resignation cannot be a mere negation because being, which we all in escapably are,
561040	564320	requires the void to be filled with something meaningful.
564320	572640	Free will itself is mostly a curse, as one does not look into the niche in abyss.
578480	583600	But the infinite boundlessness of one's possibilities, which Kierkegaard called
583600	589920	the dizziness of freedom that everyone confronts in life when we are met with freedom's
589920	596640	actuality as the possibility of possibility. This is why the philosophers try to convince
596640	602240	themselves that men are not free. Most of us are petrified of truly being free.
603600	610560	I do believe that. Having said that, I'm not as optimistic as Peterson or any other run-of-the-mill
610560	616960	conservative. Unequivocally adopting responsibility, much like the striving man Ipsofacto, cannot be
616960	623920	the antidote to rescue one from the gazing abyss or the dizziness imbued by the endless possibility
623920	633040	of possibility. I could see how most of us modern humans could be a Joseph K. or a Gregor Samsa
633040	640000	stuck in a Kafkaesque nightmare, lost in triviality and vanity, doing meaningless alienating work,
640960	648160	knowing very well our life entails nothingness, but refusing to unshackle ourselves from the
648160	657360	ideological chains as freedom hurts. Kafka himself wrote, I'm in chains, don't touch my chains.
658000	664560	Yeah, that paragraph clearly is my Marxist side. I think the conservatives are way too optimistic
664560	670640	and to some sense even naive about this question of meaning. In any case, the final paragraph.
672080	680320	Ergo, in typical absurdist fashion, I go even a step further from my previous claim of humans being
680320	686720	lousy at being happy to conclude that we're equally or even lousier at finding meaning,
686720	693360	despite being the only beings in the universe that yearns for it desperately. The predominant
693440	700640	ideologies and modes of being prescribed to us by the wisest of men, stoicism, revolt or rebellion,
702000	709360	adopting responsibility, piety, cosmic resignation, sartrean, radical freedom, the postmodern notion
709360	717040	of existence, perceived essence, etc. are inadequate for the human heart. While there are
717120	723600	pronounced ways to be unhappy, miserable, loveless and meaningless in life, there's no ideal
724960	732880	predestined way to be happy, content and living meaningfully. In that case, I have no choice but
732880	739600	to be wholeheartedly happy for the happiness of another, even though it may seem ludicrous to me.
740560	746960	I ought to never assume someone's happiness is a sign of inauthenticity or God forbid naivety.
747600	755920	And indeed, this means never to mistake my cynicism for wisdom. And in this podcast,
755920	763680	I shall always strive to never, ever make that mistake. Thanks for watching. Cheers.
