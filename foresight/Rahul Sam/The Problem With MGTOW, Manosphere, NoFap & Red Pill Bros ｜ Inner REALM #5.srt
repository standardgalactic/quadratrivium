1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
everyone welcome to yet another episode of the inner realm podcast before we

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,960
start off some housekeeping points I apologize if I'm a bit sniffly and I

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,000
cough and I do all those things with my throat you know like scratch my throat

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,320
and all that unfortunately I've got a cold I just hope that I won't be too

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,960
irritable for you the listener and if it is too bad I'll edit the whole thing

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,760
out and make it a bit more palatable the second thing is I've got to admit I've

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,160
tried recording this episode four times already yeah I've spent four different

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,520
sessions on trying to get this episode right and I don't know why but I

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,160
simply seem to not be happy with it I simply seem to not be able to convey

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,000
the points that I'm trying to convey I think partially is because even when I

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,240
was writing the script for this episode I was a bit hesitant because you know

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,560
red pill, nanosphere, MGTO doubly, NOFAP, whatever these movements or

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:08,320
subcultures are they tend to be rather controversial and very very political

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,320
by nature and as a result of that of course I I'm not a fan of this kind of

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,760
casual dismissiveness of you know corporate media and anyone that does

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,400
talk about these communities critically I think they've been so maligned and

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,320
miscarriage that anyone who tries to even be a bit critical of these

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,880
communities end up getting out of slack or end up you know being called a

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,000
fraud or a liar or something like that simply because I feel like people that

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,640
are part of these communities who benefited a lot including myself by the

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,040
way have become very defensive of what these communities are so when I was

22
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,600
trying to record the episode every single time I felt like I said something

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,240
that I shouldn't have said I felt like I'm a spoke or I said something that was

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,120
untrue so I just you know adequately I didn't feel like I could publish that

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,480
episode so I kept trying again and again hey look let's hope I get it right this

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,680
time in any case before I start off because of the as I said the nature of

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,240
the podcast I do want to make oh I want to do want to stipulate the whole

28
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,040
episode with some caveats it's not only because of the point I made before but

29
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,440
also because this is probably the first podcast where I'm actually being critical

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,280
of a certain ideology and certain cultural movement I generally don't

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,040
tend to do that but this is the first time I'm actually I think breaking down

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,760
my qualms with a certain movement and my disagreements with a certain ideology

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,240
and fleshing it out on a podcast therefore I would say things that will

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,680
contradict my claims especially my critique of ideology ironically I think

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,480
I'm gonna critique ideology using ideology so if so facto at times I will be

36
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:07,760
an utter hypocrite I will also say adding on to that point I haven't given any of

37
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,360
these communities the time and research effort they deserve so I really do

38
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,120
apologize if I'm being casually cynical or dismissive of the ideologies I mean

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,240
it does take a lot of words to truly understand the essence of what these

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,480
cultural movements and subcultures are and in no way would I like my my intent

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,760
at least and and that's why I said I recorded this podcast five times already

42
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,800
for four times already this is the fifth time because I just didn't want to

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,080
misrepresent these movements the way the corporate media does so I hope at

44
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,640
least my intent in making this recording this episode comes across and I'll

45
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,120
definitely put in the intellectual and even experiential labor to try and

46
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,560
understand these groups and the individuals within these groups deeply

47
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,800
as a matter of fact I'm reading Rolo Rolo Tomasi's book The Rational Male now

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,400
you know according to his own Amazon page I think he calls let me actually

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,480
look it up according to his own Amazon page he calls himself the godfather of

50
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,040
the red pill and I feel like he's very influential amongst his red pill aiding

51
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,240
managed fair community helping men find women and get into relationships and all

52
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,960
that and look even his book there are some some good advice I think there were

53
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,640
some things that are it can be applicable to you know our lives and I also

54
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:44,040
wanted to sort of understand the broader view of how he views sexual dynamics and

55
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,400
relationships between men and women which is why I said that I'm much not

56
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,960
gonna just watch a few episodes on YouTube or watch a few go through a few

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,760
ready threads I'm actually gonna try and you know read the books that come

58
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,000
out of these communities because I feel like writing is the most pulled out most

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,800
precise and well detailed ports for you truly want to know a person well first

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,000
look at what they do but also read what they write over what they say because

61
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:24,640
what they write in some sense is more pulled out fleshed out ideas and it's

62
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,160
because of that I would say because of all these points I made that this will

63
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,120
definitely be my first episode on this topic of many to come because these

64
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,240
subcultures I hate it when you know corporate media maligns them saying

65
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,480
that there's some French far-right group or some silly thing like that because

66
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,960
they actually are quite influential I personally know a lot of people that

67
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,000
are that I've got great benefit from these communities and that would be

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,200
including myself which is why I firstly want to make a case in defense of

69
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,720
bro culture now we've got a delineate bro culture from the red pill communities

70
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,040
on the internet I think bro culture is a bit more broader whereas red pill is a

71
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,880
lot more political oh by the way I just want to add a point since obviously MGTO

72
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,000
W manasphere no fap it's all a mouthful as a umbrella term I'll just use the word

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,320
red pill community but I do think this whole bro culture and this idea of you

74
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:36,040
know masculinity what would it call it hyper masculinity maybe just connect a

75
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:43,440
lot with the red pill community it goes hand-in-hand in many ways I gotta say

76
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,840
as a young man when I was maybe 17 18 or probably even a bit younger and then

77
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:57,480
even into my early 20s like 1920 maybe even 21 bro culture was extremely

78
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,520
beneficial for me as a young person and the best to define what bro culture is

79
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:09,960
is through my anecdotal experience so bro culture is greatly connected to

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,760
sports and and yeah like the red hole the red hole red pill thing it's

81
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,840
interesting right because a lot of people that generally tend to be a part of

82
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,960
really embrace that bro doctor in the bro culture they probably would consider

83
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:35,480
themselves to be red-pilled or whatever and a good way to define bro culture is

84
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,880
actually by a speech by the Roosevelt the eponymous speech called the

85
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,160
strenuous life and I think it captures what bro culture is best in a more

86
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,520
refined gentlemanly manner and I quote a small part from the speech it says I

87
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,560
wish to preach not the doctrine of ignoble ease but the doctrine of the

88
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,080
strenuous life the life of toil and effort of labor and strike to preach that

89
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,120
highest form of success which comes not to the man who desires mere easy peace

90
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,240
but to the man who does not shrink from danger from hardship or from bitter

91
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,520
toil and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph so yes as I

92
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,120
said this is kind of the message of bro culture it's the whole pull yourself up

93
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,520
by your bootstraps message and as I I'm probably repeating myself now it's

94
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,800
deeply associated with sports it's this embrace of masculinity the good and the

95
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,080
bad keep in mind and it gives the message of self-reliance to nasty

96
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,920
discipline and I feel especially for young boys and young men this is a great

97
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,840
message you know leaving aside politics the whole you know picking up women

98
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,720
thing and the whole all the critiques that I come to their role I still

99
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,720
believe essentially these are good messages you know they they not just

100
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,560
for men but even for women telling someone to take responsibility for their

101
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,680
life it's something that we don't hear much in contemporary culture and I

102
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,440
would also say you know on the on the topic of strength and sort of self

103
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,240
improvement let's say a good good example is Elliot Hulse now undoubtedly

104
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:32,920
Elliot Hulse is a full-on bro he's like the quintessential bro and is also very

105
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,200
much in the whole redfoot community he's going through his own face he had the

106
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,240
whole mega thing now I used to watch a lot of Elliot Hulse's videos because I

107
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,560
was rather I would say enamored by strength I still am I I admire strength

108
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,840
and you know I really like strongman and I used to watch some some of his some

109
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,760
of his videos to you know to do strongman workouts and all that before I

110
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:03,600
stopped because suddenly I felt like he became this very zealous

111
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,080
Tradcon traditional conservative and you know he was like all he talks about is

112
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,680
like how women should submit to men and and he really kind of embodied that

113
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,040
whole traditional conservative I don't even know the Tradcon ethos into

114
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,280
himself and then it frankly it became as much I still like him I still think he

115
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,240
gives good advice like for example I'm gonna pick up a small clip from his

116
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,040
podcast here to you know exemplify what I mean but he's became this like a

117
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,120
knowing ideal of that constantly preached Tradcon values and and constantly

118
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,960
evangelized his way of living and prescribed his way of living onto the

119
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,560
world and I guess onto his videos in this case but despite all of that this is

120
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,480
an example of why I think this whole bro culture movement and the let's say the

121
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,000
what's the word not poorly is but the more influential people in this

122
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,920
movement do give a good message so this one's on the whole no fat movement and

123
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,440
which is also connected to all of this look I think the young people especially

124
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,280
young men have a massive problem with photography I've dealt with it I would

125
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,840
call it a behavioral addiction I think a lot of people are either ashamed to talk

126
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,240
about it or they trivialize it but as far as I'm concerned I know a lot of my

127
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,960
mates who sometimes ah it's like they if that isn't an addiction I don't know

128
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,280
what it is you know like they'll go hours sometimes you know indulging

129
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,480
themselves in porn consuming porn so it definitely is a problem it's definitely

130
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,080
something that has to be spoken of and for the longest time the only people

131
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,080
that spoke about porn addiction and this problem with internet pornography

132
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:59,440
were the red pill grows all the people in this you know no fat movement which

133
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,200
is connected to the bro culture they were the only people that actually spoke

134
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:13,080
about how this is probably a dangerous thing that it's probably affecting young

135
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,400
people in their cases focus more on men you know psychologically spiritually

136
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:25,280
but I found this particular video by Elliot to be a rather astute take because

137
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,880
he doesn't just say don't watch porn don't jerk off or he doesn't just say you

138
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,640
know don't don't be a loser that just sits sitting on jocks in front of a

139
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,560
computer all day and you know jerks off for women on the internet just jerks

140
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,800
off to women on the internet he actually makes a very very interesting

141
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,200
point and this is a bit bit of a longer video but I think what he's trying to say

142
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,040
is a good example of the kind of messages one could hear from the bro

143
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,080
culture movement and then how that could be greatly beneficial for young people

144
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:05,120
mostly for young people but for anyone really I've heard you yo Elliot I've

145
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,000
heard you say that men in their 20s should bust their nut once a week why

146
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,480
is this I think I'd like to retain for as much longer than one week thank you

147
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,240
I'm loving this program so first of all I have my conviction about it that comes

148
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,880
from what I've studied right again this is I'm not an expert in this but I've

149
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,600
often referred to this great little book called listen to your body and it's

150
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,840
based on traditional Chinese medicine and I do think that there's some value I

151
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,360
think there's tremendous value to Chinese medicine and natural health right

152
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,280
essentially it's natural health how to be healthy naturally without you know big

153
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:48,960
pharma and so there are ways to live that that improve longevity and vitality

154
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,960
and make you feel good right make you make you the best you and so according to

155
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,480
traditional Chinese medicine in this nice little cute little book he goes on

156
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,080
and says that there are clear guidelines and traditional Chinese medicine

157
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:07,400
about ejaculation of sperm so the the premise is that the more you blow your

158
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,720
load the more you're you're losing your vitality right and I think we've all

159
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,880
sort of experienced that right I know I've had right it took me until my 40s

160
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,000
I didn't realize it when I was younger a lot of you guys recognize it more for

161
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,160
whatever reason but not until my 40s I started to recognize it boy the day after

162
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,640
I blow my load and for like you know a day or two a little off and then I also

163
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,760
discovered takes me about 10 days personally at this point for me to feel

164
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,200
that vigor that fire that I've had before blowing my load and now it makes it

165
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,840
makes sense to me now after reading this pseudo scientific right I don't think

166
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,480
there's anything wrong with pseudoscience right in fact like the whole

167
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,560
vaccine thing is pseudoscience it's like not exactly science but they're

168
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,040
pointing at something there see what I mean for some reason

169
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,360
unfortunately because they get sucked into ideology suddenly everyone who's a

170
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,040
part of the Red Bull movement also have to be you know I would say I'm fairly

171
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,760
critical of vaccines and the whole movement or what whole whole thing that

172
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:24,640
happened during COVID in any case out of the video so anyway it says clear

173
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,640
guidelines about ejaculation of sperm in general not more than twice a month is

174
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,800
advised because of loss of vitality other consideration includes the men's

175
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,000
health and his age the ancient texts give the following advice for a man of 20

176
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
years old once in every four days just going based on that right at 30 once

177
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,200
every eight days at 40 once every 16 days at 50 once every 20 days and at 60

178
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:59,280
once a month so I come to the conclusion now this validates what was my

179
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,000
conclusion or they kind of work together I don't know if I had this thought

180
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,960
and then read it in the book or read the book and it helped me have thought but

181
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,960
I've sort of sort of brought this together in my own mind that's or based on my

182
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,680
experience as well this is I think this is a pretty solid guideline it doesn't

183
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,720
mean that it's written in stone but one of the things that I've discovered just

184
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,560
through my own experience but watching you guys and watching videos and

185
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,280
noticing this whole no fat we seem in retention movement there are a few things

186
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,400
that could be pathological about it and one of them is that it becomes starts to

187
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,320
become a God it starts to become an obsession what I mean by that right in

188
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,280
the same way that masturbation becomes an obsession right because he's

189
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,640
engaging in that ritual and you're worshiping porn every day when you do

190
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,480
this there is a sense of pride I started to notice it when I was fasting right I

191
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,120
fasted before doing see you see me retention I fasted you know started

192
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,720
fasting back in 2018 I only started doing see more attention this year and so

193
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,960
I'm careful with myself because I saw what happened to me with fasting I started

194
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:14,360
to get proud I started to personally identify with my streaks you catch where

195
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm going with this I started to make it a bigger deal than what it was and the

196
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,240
month the monks the the month the monastery the guys in the monasteries

197
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,200
right I think I remember reading this from Briana Shav also he talks about how

198
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:38,120
not to be too austere with yourself for fear of pride he says that Satan loves

199
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,360
it when you're really tough on yourself because then you start to become you know

200
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:51,800
hmm well I did no fat for 20 days I did 30 days I did 50 days all right so then

201
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,260
it starts to become a religion it starts to become an obsession it starts to

202
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,640
become an idol that's barely what it ends up becoming right or I fasted wow this

203
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,360
guy fasted for 10 days why he fasted for 20 days well I only fasted for five

204
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,240
days I gotta live up to these guys it starts to become an ego issue and I

205
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,320
don't and I wouldn't have been able to warn against this as it relates to see

206
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,280
intention had I not messed up during my first season of fasting now I don't take

207
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,400
myself too seriously with any of this stuff in other words I don't make it an

208
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,840
idol I don't have I'm not personally identified with it I don't get my sense

209
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,160
of value and self-worth from it so that's just that's one warning right that's

210
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,840
more of a that's more of a spiritual warning it's a warning against pride

211
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,080
that's all it is right start to feel like well look what I did and even that

212
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:54,600
just just just the whole idea that I am going to fast is sort of an idol it's

213
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:02,280
sort of a egotistical way of looking at it when the saints and the divines and

214
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,800
the mystics right I love the orthodox tradition they even call some of their

215
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:18,880
guys mystics they they they recognize that it is it's a it's a spiritual battle

216
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,840
that you're you're gearing up for it's not a matter of challenging your yourself

217
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:30,840
right it's and when it's a spiritual battle it's beyond your will and so I

218
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,760
can will myself to get something done and then I can be proud about it because

219
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:42,840
look at me or if it's a spiritual fast it's a spiritual retention or abstinence

220
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:53,000
right it's God is helping me God has given me grace to do this this is a

221
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,320
humble way of looking at life that saves us from pride but also saves us from

222
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,520
depression because if you start to think that it's up to me to get things done and

223
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,800
they don't get done you're gonna feel bad about yourself so both either way if we

224
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,760
if our if our will wins or loses we lose if your will wins you will you lose

225
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:21,600
because you become proud if your will loses you lose because you take that

226
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,800
personally as well it's like the opposite of pride but it's on the same

227
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,480
spectrum I don't even know what to call it right but like depression right

228
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,320
depression is is on the same spectrum of pride I don't that's the right word but

229
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,840
feeling sorry and sad about yourself is just as it's almost it's a it's a other

230
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,200
side of the same coin of feeling proud and good about yourself because they're

231
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:53,720
both wrapped up in what I can do what I didn't do as opposed to resting in the

232
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:00,920
Lord and saying and asking God to give me the grace I think that perspective is

233
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:10,200
good for us right again once again I don't know I know that there's spiritual

234
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,360
wisdom in the literature and the Bible and stuff like this right I know that

235
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,480
there are good ideas that were propounded by ascetics and such and then

236
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,520
then there are commandments things to do and not to do but in my life I've looked

237
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,640
at those things and I recognize them as maybe external like okay I get that I

238
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,280
see that I understand that but it's not until and maybe we gotta all make our

239
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:42,240
own mistakes is not until I've seen it in myself and others that I'm like oh this

240
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,800
is practical advice it's not just religious weird stuff right so you know

241
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,120
people are like oh that's all archaic religious thinking well it's actually

242
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,760
very practical right so it's very practical to lean on God lean on the

243
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,560
Creator lean on the Father lean on nature whatever you want to call it even

244
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,680
though nature is a fruit of God I want to be in walking with the Creator rather

245
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,040
than offering it up or recognizing that I am not 100% sovereign over my life but

246
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:22,920
the grace and mercy of God precedes me then you can't get depressed you can't

247
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,400
get depressed you can't get depressed because your life is in the hands of

248
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,600
the Lord and if he sees it fit for you to have this failure then it's up to you

249
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:37,480
to be grateful for and see the lining in the cloud the silver lining of the

250
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,960
cloud right every every every bad thing that happens to us it's because God is

251
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,720
allowing it to happen to us because we're supposed to make something of it

252
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,080
but if you think that you're in charge and something bad happens you start

253
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,000
going okay what did I do how do I fix this why why why me I screwed up I'm such

254
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,580
a bad person and the same thing on the other side right it's the same coin same

255
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,760
coin oh look what I did proud of me look at this I did it and you didn't

256
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:12,120
right it's the same shit same shit you gotta stop you gotta stop and so as just

257
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,440
a warning against that right I'm not saying that's gonna happen to you but

258
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:23,520
just as a warning I advise not to push ourselves that hard I know that doesn't

259
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,400
I know that sounds like a contradiction from you know promasculine Elliot that's

260
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,160
telling everybody to do hard stuff but having austerity having discipline being

261
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,360
committed to something is very different than being attached to something

262
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,520
making something an idol and and and being personally identified with it very

263
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,120
different things try your best in everything that you do but leave room

264
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:57,160
for God that's all it is I feel like this is like you know Elliot being the

265
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:05,200
as I said the quintessential example of what a you know the port leader in the

266
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,280
broke culture movement would be this is great this is great advice he speaks

267
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,840
about humility he speaks about he doesn't speak about mere like peace

268
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,160
unanimous weak humility but he speaks about genuine humility he speaks about

269
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,480
the dangers of pride and you know as our culture has become more and more secular

270
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,960
and more materialistic we don't really talk about those let's say higher human

271
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,160
virtues anymore and when I was younger before you know I understand Elliot was

272
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,880
kind of evangelizing he has become very religious but even before he became sort

273
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,440
of the track on bro he used to talk a lot about these things in the middle of

274
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,800
the strength cam strongman videos he would give really good life advice and

275
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,760
I wouldn't even go to his channel for life advice per se as like a teenager but

276
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,520
he'd you know slip it in somewhere and then I'm and I think to myself oh that's

277
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,520
actually that's a that's a gem right there that's quite interesting you know

278
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,280
when he's for example he spoke about how depression and pride or depression and

279
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,840
this sense of euphoria and and eternal happiness or whatever you may call it

280
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,360
it's the same side of the same is a is a different side of the same coin that's

281
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,240
a very very brilliant insight that that shows he's got a perspicuity a

282
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:33,040
perspicuity and which is why I think messages like this all these workshops

283
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,520
and and different seminars that they organize in these communities it

284
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,840
provides community it provides brotherhood and fatherhood you know we I

285
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,080
believe definitely are living in the midst of a loneliness pandemic a lot of

286
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,680
people I can speak you know through my personal anecdotes through personal

287
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:58,360
conversations conversations I've had and stuff I've read are lonely

288
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,760
unfortunately due to unfortunately modernity after industrialized

289
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:11,160
industrialization and you you know how how how how capitalism has

290
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,960
completely been so pernicious in our society and made people into cogs in

291
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,600
this massive machine it's alienated us and that has created a lot of loneliness

292
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:29,040
that along with you know traditional little traditional small-scale communities

293
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,440
that dying off and people are becoming more cosmopolitan and people are going

294
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,920
to cities these smaller communities that with the epicenters of meaning and

295
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:43,080
community with them dying off definitely a lot of people are feeling a lot more

296
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,720
alienated ironically even though we think we have connected and all of this

297
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,320
yearnings all of these yearnings that young men let me let me speak for young

298
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,680
men from over here to young men from over here have you know the yearning for

299
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,880
brotherhood the yearning for structure the yearning for a purpose the broculture

300
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,880
for those years yearnings at least it gave me a structure when I was a lot

301
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,600
younger and it really wasn't really comfortable in my own shoes let's say so

302
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,720
the reason I wanted to put that part in the podcast is I wanted to be genuine

303
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,240
and sincere and show that I'm not being casually dismissive I use that term a

304
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,800
lot these days casually dismissive of these movements and I'm actually they've

305
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,400
actually you know helped me a lot that they've benefited me a lot and I've

306
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,080
even been a part of these movements when I was younger which is why probably I have

307
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,960
more insight into how to criticize them because I understood how a certain

308
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,640
person in a red pill movement with pink now the first this first point is

309
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:58,480
generally the problem with subcultures not nothing particular specific to the

310
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,360
red pill grows it is that Internet subcultures they kind of become a bit

311
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,640
cultish for sure but they also inevitably go to the extreme and they're

312
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,720
inherently ideological like they cannot exist without being ideological because

313
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:24,080
they need a dogma they need a doctrine to attract people and then they need and

314
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,800
then that doctrine once it's got enough people it becomes a self-perpetuating

315
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,720
belief it becomes a self-sustaining belief the more people that join these

316
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,400
different communities I also believe and I can't get to this get into this in

317
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:47,840
this whole in this podcast because it's a it's a whole book but I also believe

318
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:58,120
that unlike religion ideology never tells a full story whereas religion I

319
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,680
believe gives the complete narrative most religious stories give the complete

320
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,960
narrative ideology tells only one part of the story I think it was Jordan Peterson

321
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,680
who really made this crystallized this in my mind when I heard him talk about

322
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,200
this but I thought that makes a lot of sense so of course I've used to what

323
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,120
ideology a lot I've said that I'm critical of these subcultures I've also

324
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,520
said that I'm critical of the fact that they are ideological plus I'm critical

325
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,000
of the ideology so many things I'm critical of but let's run understand

326
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,160
what ideology is now it's a difficult thing to defend you know ideology isn't

327
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,440
merely a set of principles or a set of beliefs that refuse to update itself it's

328
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,120
a lot more deeper than that it affects us the subject psychologically way way

329
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,120
more deeply than I thought until I was exposed to Slavo Gijek's work so

330
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,000
Slavo Gijek kind of talks about ideology in his film the perverts guide to

331
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
ideology and he describes ideology best I think here's a short clip

332
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,840
hey buddy you're gonna pay for that or what

333
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:21,040
look buddy I don't want no house today either pay for it or put it back

334
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:29,480
according to our common sense we think that ideology is something blurring

335
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:37,800
confusing our straight view ideology should be glasses which distort our

336
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:45,920
view and the critique of ideology should be the opposite like you take off the

337
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:53,240
glasses so that you can finally see the way things really are this precisely and

338
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,400
here the pessimism of the film of the leaf is well justified this precisely is

339
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,880
the ultimate illusion ideology is not simply in post on ourselves

340
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:13,080
ideologies our spontaneous relationship to our social world how we perceive its

341
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:21,720
meaning and so on and so on we in a way enjoy our ideology alright to step out

342
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:28,480
of ideology it hurts it's a painful experience you must force yourself to

343
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,240
do it this is rendered in a wonderful way with a further scene in the film

344
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:43,280
where John Nada tries to force his best friend John Armitage to also put the

345
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:50,040
glasses on I don't want to fight you I don't want to fight stop it no and it's

346
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:56,720
the weirdest scene in the film the fight takes eight nine minutes it may appear

347
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,440
irrational because why does this guy reject so violently to put the glasses

348
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:09,960
on it is as if he is well aware that spontaneously he lives in a lie that the

349
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,040
glasses will make him see the truth but that this truth can be painful can

350
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:29,400
shatter many of your illusions this is a paradox we have to accept the extreme

351
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:37,280
violence of liberation you must be forced to be free if you trust simply

352
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:43,120
your spontaneous sense of well-being or whatever you will never get free what

353
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:51,640
freedom hurt brilliantly put you know I I think it was only Zizek who really

354
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:58,800
made me understand how much ideology captivates or even possesses us and once

355
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,680
it does why so difficult for us to let go of it so in that sense I actually feel

356
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:12,960
a deep sense of empathy with ideologues because you know actually let me let me

357
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,840
read a few excerpts from this essay by Mac Mac Mac Manus on the philosophy of

358
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:25,600
Zizek he says the appeal of ideology is that it enables us to bring psychic

359
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,320
stability to a social and natural world that is chaotic and broken in and of

360
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,440
itself that's an important point a latter point is something I it took me a

361
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,520
bit of time to understand this of what Zizek is trying to convey according to

362
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:47,520
Zizek the essence of being it may be even a metaphysical ontological claim is

363
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:55,320
chaotic so what ideology does it is at as Matt specifies here it gives psychic

364
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,280
stability which is why once we are assessed by an ideology once we become

365
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,800
a let's say the red pill ideology or the feminist ideology or some some

366
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,400
political framework or some socio-political framework that takes hold of

367
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,040
us it fundamentally changes our psychology it fundamentally affects our

368
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,840
psyche and then we just don't want to let go of it because as Zizek says

369
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:25,400
freedom hurts because freedom really is the is the confrontation of this chaotic

370
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:32,480
nature of this chaotic essence of being and that's a scary thing and you know

371
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,480
going on with the essay oh by the way the essay is was on a road magazine it's

372
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,040
called the philosophy of Slavo Zizek I haven't read all of Zizek's books for

373
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,760
sure but I've read a lot read and listen to a lot of his lectures and I would say

374
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,160
this essay was quite apt and quite accurate as to what Zizek tries to

375
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,000
convey through his work another excerpt is ideology provides us with a way of

376
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,840
projecting psychic stability onto the world for instance it enables us to

377
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:06,440
simplify complex socio-political and natural processes into simple party

378
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,080
narratives once again the red pill bros would say all of the problems that men

379
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,760
have are because of feminist or because of modernity or because of you know

380
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,680
neoliberalism or blame it on some group blame it on the other and that is taking

381
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:31,200
a very complex socio-political change and a natural process of society evolving

382
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,320
and breaking it simply into partisan narratives or breaking it simply into

383
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,880
something a lot more tribal and that's the danger of ideology and this again

384
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,400
I'm still in some sense even though I'm connecting this to the red pill

385
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,440
movement I'm still making a very general point on how anyone is susceptible any

386
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,120
movement is susceptible to ideology including religion of course that's

387
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,960
when it becomes fundamentalism ideology simplifies the chaotic

388
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,480
incompleteness of society and nature and provides us with a firm sense of

389
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,960
identity and values there you go it's what's interesting is you know the

390
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,960
latter point there and provides us with the firm sense of identity and values so

391
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,440
you probably remember I said initially that you know in my part where I was

392
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,080
talking about in defense of bro culture how as a young person these red pill

393
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,960
movements gave me structure gave me a framework to view the world through and

394
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,800
and it took me a long time probably 21 22 and maybe even 23 took me about two to

395
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,440
three years to break out of it because breaking out of it for me it was a

396
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,520
daunting task it perturbed me it brought this sense of existential angst so

397
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,840
again then I man I really hope I don't sound super serious or patronizing when

398
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,920
I say this that's definitely not I'm not trying to say or look at me over here

399
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,120
free from ideology I've got over the red pill movement I've got over all these

400
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,600
different subcultures on the internet and I'm my own person and I'm so like

401
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,480
above them and pointing fingers at them I really hope I'm not doing that I'm

402
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,320
what I'm saying is I totally empathize with why we're attracted to these

403
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:21,960
movements and how their their doctrines assess us and you know when

404
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,800
Kedricat again was influenced sorry Zizek was again influenced by Kedricat and

405
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,520
you know when when Zizek talks about this how the the essence of the world is

406
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,800
is kind of broken and chaotic I think it comes a lot from absurdism you know of

407
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,240
course popularized by Kamu but Kamu too was influenced by Kedricat and I believe

408
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,320
Kedricat said this very famous paragraph of his in his book either or and I think

409
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,880
this is a very this is this is like typical Kedricat you know with the humor and with the

410
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:04,760
absurdity but it's also a a it's a it's a typical sentiment of kind of the existentialist it goes

411
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:12,680
something like this marry and you will regret it don't marry you will also regret it marry or

412
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,680
don't marry you will regret it either way laugh at the world's foolishness you will regret it

413
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:25,240
weep over it you will regret that too laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it you will

414
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,960
regret both believe a woman you will regret it believe her or not you will also regret it

415
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:38,280
hang yourself you will regret it do not hang yourself you will regret that too

416
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,280
hang yourself or don't hang yourself you'll regret it either way whether you hang yourself

417
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:52,120
or do not hang yourself. You will regret both. This gentleman is the essence of old philosophy.

418
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,480
There are some things that are just so true, that the only way to speak about them is through

419
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:07,240
humor, through fuzz. And I think that's what character God is doing here. And then of course,

420
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,400
another famous line from Camus, he says, man stands face to face with a rational,

421
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,560
he feels within him, he's longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born out of this

422
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:24,840
confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.

423
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:35,320
This is deeply true. We all look for psychic stability of some kind to cushion ourselves and

424
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:41,160
sometimes even extract ourselves from the absurd. And we have no choice. We need to confront the

425
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:50,600
absurd. So my biggest problem with ideology is, in some sense, ideology makes one a coward.

426
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:58,120
It tells one that, no, just be comfortable in your own little bubble in this little ideological

427
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:04,280
framework and do not confront the absurd, do not confront the chaotic nature of the world,

428
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,280
which takes courage. And I believe it's in that confrontation once, once soul matures and when

429
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,640
develops his character and builds those higher virtues that we so rarely speak about these days.

430
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:23,960
Now, I come to something maybe a bit more specific to the red pill movement. And maybe

431
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,840
actually, since I did speak about Rollo Tomasi a bit earlier in his whole manosphere and because

432
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,880
he even though he touches on politics, and especially he's very, very critical of feminism,

433
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:43,880
he also focuses a lot on gender dynamics and sexual dynamics and relationships and dating

434
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:51,160
between men and women. So in his book, The Rational Male, and I think this is the gist of

435
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,120
what I got when I was reading it, but I didn't just want to read it, even though I felt reading

436
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:02,760
is because important for this particular podcast episode. I also listened to some of his interviews

437
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:10,680
and a big problem with modern society. And this really angers me. It really annoys me is

438
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:18,840
we've completely lost ourselves in abstracting and categorizing at infinity. We truly stopped

439
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:25,800
looking as people as individuals and rather started looking at them as abstractions. And this has

440
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:32,920
got nothing to do with left, right. It's just, it's a cultural, it's a cultural zeitgeist shift.

441
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,320
You know, because we live in such a globalized world, we've begun to bureaucratize everything.

442
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:45,000
Everything is becoming rather Kafkaesque and the human individual in some sense is being negated,

443
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,960
as being made into non-being, let's say, because we've completely begun categorizing everything.

444
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,200
Men are this way. Women are this way. Black people are this way. White people are this way.

445
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:05,400
Ah, I don't want to keep going. Gay people are this way. LGBTQ folks are that way. It never stops.

446
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:15,240
And the more we do this, the more we demean and the more value we give to the individual souls,

447
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:22,680
the uniqueness, the idiosyncrasies of the individual, the nuances of being an individual,

448
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:31,800
we don't pay attention to that anymore. And that again, I do blame a lot for the death of religion.

449
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,400
I do think a lot of religions speak a lot about that kind of individual spirituality, individual

450
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:43,640
connection with the transcendent, with the divine, and with this kind of abstract categorizing that

451
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:50,280
rarely happens, seldom does that happen. So, as I said, we've stopped looking at the souls,

452
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,200
we've become categorized people, and it's also become kind of obsessive. You look at

453
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,520
psychologists that talk about the big five and talk about psychometricians, because

454
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,800
fairly, maybe that itself is its own ideology because it's easy. It's an easy way to make

455
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:09,080
sense of the world when we categorize things and put things in their place and give things order.

456
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,840
I only really started to understand this phenomenon when I read Dostoevsky, especially when I read

457
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:25,080
this part in the Brothers Karamazov, where I believe Father Zezema is speaking to this

458
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,920
young woman who says that she cannot, Father Zezema, by the way, is one of the

459
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,760
wiser sort of sage-like characters in Dostoevsky's novel, The Brothers Karamazov. So,

460
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:45,240
he's talking to this young woman who says she cannot love people, she cannot love humanity,

461
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,200
and then he responds with this beautiful paragraph he says,

462
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,320
it's just the same story as a doctor once told me, observe the elder. He was a man

463
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:02,760
getting on in years and undoubtedly clever. He spoke as frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter

464
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:10,840
jest. I love humanity, he said, but I wonder at myself, the more I love humanity in general,

465
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:17,800
the less I love men in particular. In my dreams, he said, I have come, I've often come to make,

466
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:24,200
to making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually have

467
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:32,360
face crucifixion if it had been soundly necessary. And yet I am incapable of living in the same room

468
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,760
with anyone for two days together, as I know by experience. As soon as anyone is near me,

469
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:46,520
his personality disturbs my self complacency and restricts my freedom. In 24 hours, I begin to hate

470
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:53,240
the best of men, one because he's too low over his dinner, another because he has a cold and

471
00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:00,760
keeps on blowing his nose. That was probably me. I become hostile to people the moment they come

472
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:07,160
close to me, but it has always happened that the more I detest men individually, the more ardently

473
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:16,440
my love for humanity. What a, man, you gotta read Dostoevsky, man, like what a, what a brilliant

474
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:24,200
point, what an astute take on society. Many of these Internet subcultures are making the same

475
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:30,600
mistake that Father Zezima talks about. As I said, people like Rollo Tomasi, the more I listen to

476
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,960
him on what I hear is, you know, what's funny is he unknowingly does this, he'd even explicitly say,

477
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:42,360
I'm not generalizing, but then he'll go ahead and generalize. I remember he was having this

478
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:47,160
conversation with a, with another woman and they were kind of going at it. They were in deep

479
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:54,280
disagreement. And even when she shared something about her personal life, he instantly took what

480
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:00,760
the, what she said and tried to abstract it out and put her into some box. I didn't see him

481
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:07,000
truly paying attention to what her as a unique individual was saying, but he had to

482
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,200
really get the, get the gist of what she was saying and they put her in a box, you're this kind of

483
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,960
woman. And I think that's really unfortunate because, you know, whether, whether he disagreed

484
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,600
or agreed with her, it doesn't, it's not the case. It doesn't matter. It's paying attention to what

485
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:28,840
her as an individual was saying, which is, you know, to be fair, what the psychoanalyst discovered,

486
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:35,400
you know, the Freud's that you got to truly, truly listen to a person as to what they're saying.

487
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,080
Don't try and make assumptions. Don't try and pigeonhole them. Don't try and put them in boxes.

488
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:48,520
Just pay attention. So all of these subcultures, subcultures, they unknowingly categorize women,

489
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:54,280
men, and relationships to the extreme. And yes, this may be beneficial for some people,

490
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:00,200
but I think what that does is again, this is something, this is ineffable.

491
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,720
It truly is, this is ineffable human experience.

492
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:11,320
It can't even be spoken of. And I think we really feel it only when we pay attention.

493
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:20,920
When we do this kind of categorizing and generalizing, we lose that. It's a magical,

494
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,360
beautiful thing. It's a life sustaining thing. And I feel like a lot of us in modernity have lost

495
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:34,280
that. And to be fair, this is no different to what a radical feminist or someone in Antifa or

496
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,520
some other ideologue would do. This again is a problem with ideology. And which is why I think

497
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,880
even though one can take certain lessons from the Red Perk community, like the lesson that

498
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:51,000
Elliot gave about porn and NOFAP and all of that, one should never completely let the ideology

499
00:47:51,960 --> 00:48:00,360
control one and become a mouthpiece for the ideology. And not to never be afraid to think

500
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:05,800
freely and think independently. It is the most important thing. It's having the courage

501
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,240
to confront the chaos of the world and to truly be an independent thinker. One should never forget

502
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:18,120
that. I would also say maybe this is a bit of an ancillary point, but I think it's connected.

503
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:23,800
As the book itself says, it's the rational male. All these books are called the rational male. So

504
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:31,960
Robo Tamasi deeply respects reason. And generally people who tend to be the rationalist types,

505
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:38,200
the Stephen Pinkers, people who hold reason to be the highest virtue, let's say, they tend to play

506
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,840
a lot in this abstract game, in this game of abstractions and conceptualization. So the Rolo,

507
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:52,280
in some sense, one can never win a debate with Rolo because he would say the moment, let's say we

508
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,800
make an experiential claim, not an axiomatic truth, maybe make an experiential claim from our own

509
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:04,600
subjective life, not some kind of sadistic or objective claim that just generally applies to

510
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,480
everyone, but rather a subjective claim. He'll say, you're being irrational. Therefore, you lose

511
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:15,640
the debate. So he's already set the axioms or he's already set the rules for a conversation

512
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,240
even before we get into a conversation. So there's no way, which is why Rolo Tamasi is

513
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,560
kind of the Ben Shapiro. So some of those guys, you rarely see them lose a debate because the

514
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,440
framework they view through is that of reason. And again, I'm not being critical of reason.

515
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:38,280
Reason is important. In some sense, I'm using reason in this podcast to flesh out my points and

516
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:48,200
lay out my criticisms. But reason isn't the only form of epistemology, let's say. It's not the only

517
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:54,760
way at truth. There are many ways. For me, in some sense, I probably value experiential truth more

518
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:02,440
than even reason-based truth. Because for me, in some sense, once experience is more palpable,

519
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:09,640
it's more real. It's what one truly feels. And I would say, to end off this segment,

520
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:17,640
the truth is, we're all deeply lonely. No one will truly ever understand us. We must accept this

521
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:24,360
verity that we are all deeply lonely. No one, not even once wife, once partner would truly know

522
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:31,000
what happens in one's mind, what experiences we have. So the loneliness itself is an

523
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,480
existential part of life. I think Paul Tillich talks about, in his phenomenology, he talks

524
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:43,320
about the concept of anxiety. And he talks about meaninglessness a lot. But meaninglessness is

525
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:48,760
one thing. But even, I think Paul Tillich also touches on the idea of us as being lonely, us as

526
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:54,680
being like an atom detached from being, this incongruence we feel between ourselves and the

527
00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:05,400
world. And we must confront this is no other way. Ideology isn't going to rescue us, I put it that

528
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:15,880
way. And now, this may be, oh man, on the whole dating thing, I couldn't believe some of the messages

529
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:24,040
either explicitly or tacitly that these communities give out. I'm going to be honest,

530
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:30,520
it rather disgusted me. Some of the ways that they generalize women, and they say that women are

531
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:38,760
like this, women are this kind of men. And I rarely, rarely hear these groups talk about love,

532
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:45,960
various love in dating. I don't think I even hear the word love come out. Because essentially,

533
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:51,720
for me, that's what dating is about. I date for love, for monogamy, for marriage, for deep

534
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:57,960
commitment. And all these communities, you know, people, let's say from the man's sphere or the

535
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:05,960
red pill dating communities, make the whole relationship thing like a game. That it's just a

536
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,160
zero sum game where you got to one up each other and you got to win. You know, they'll use terms like

537
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:18,440
sexual marketplace or sexual market value, detrimental terms. They use terms like economically

538
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:27,800
attractive. And they'll completely commoditize individuals or women in this case. And you know,

539
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:33,000
that definitely is because of how pernicious I think capitalism has become. And in some sense,

540
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,240
this is what Zizek, you know, who's very, very critical of capitalism says. It's not that ideology

541
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:47,160
that the ideology of capitalism has just this detached system that just exists on its own.

542
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,920
It deeply affects us, the subjects who are involved in it. And as a result of that, which is why

543
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:58,920
even something like dating, which I believe should be undergirded by love, becomes a marketplace,

544
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:05,160
becomes an economical transaction. And the more I listen to, you know, even when I was reading the

545
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,680
book, you know, they talk about concepts like hypergamy. And I understand that a hypergamy

546
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:15,000
definitely has a lot of evidence for it. But still, the, they'll say some facts. So we, we,

547
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,240
we run into the, you know, it's all problem, they'll state some facts. This is how things are. And the

548
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:29,880
odd would be, the odd would be this sort of cajoled or this contrived idea of, of the ideological

549
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:36,200
presuppositions. And, you know, honestly, some of them make women look like these self-serving,

550
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:43,240
rapacious capitalists who only date men for, for pretty much for social status or money.

551
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,840
I would say, man, I really recommend this video by Olivia. I'm not going to play the whole thing

552
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:55,560
because it's 20 minutes. It's called Our Conception of Love is Messed Up. It's such a beautiful video.

553
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:02,360
I truly resonate with what Olivia says here. She's a great YouTuber. I'll leave a link to it down in

554
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,880
the description. I'd probably play it. And also Bell Hooks, President Peace Queen, say we need to shift

555
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,960
our perspective. Anyway, I'm not going to, I'm not going to play the whole thing because it's 25

556
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:18,840
minutes. And she talks about how a modern conception of love is all about how can I

557
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:24,040
better myself? How can I look better? How can I look more healthy, you know, so that I can

558
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:29,800
be more attractive to my partner? And she says, instead, why not treat love like an art? Why not

559
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:35,880
treat dating of how can I give myself to the other person? How can I fulfill the other person's needs?

560
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:43,640
And instead of saying, how can I better myself? How can I play this game? And then if the other

561
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:49,960
person has a bad day, if the other person doesn't reciprocate, reciprocate, then this person's not

562
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:55,640
for me. I don't love this person. Like love is, you know, in that sense, love is metaphysical. Love

563
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:02,440
isn't a mere transactional thing. And, you know, Olivia makes a good point that love has to be

564
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:09,720
detached from capitalist ideology. For me, I was talking a bit about absurdism before.

565
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:16,920
For me, essentially the antidote to absurdism and this sense of meaninglessness is love.

566
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,560
It's not just love in relationships and dating, of course, it's not just romantic love, but it's,

567
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:27,720
you know, love within family, you know, what's it called? Is it filial love? I forget, love within

568
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:37,000
friends, and even if possible, love for humanity as a whole, as a whole. And when we view this whole

569
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:46,440
thing as some zero sum game, it truly corrupts it, it attains it. And I would say this, and I really

570
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:54,040
want to make this point. Love is terrifying. It's beautiful than terrifying. I've fallen in love

571
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,080
twice in my life. The first time it was beautiful than terrifying. The second time it's beautiful

572
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:05,000
than terrifying. And in some sense, I had no, I had no, it wasn't up to my own volition. I had no

573
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:11,080
choice in falling in love, which is probably why they call it the fall. And, you know, the whole

574
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:17,560
red pig communities and the people like Rollo Tamasi make it look like pick some boxes and

575
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,520
completely plan it out. And then you'll find the perfect woman, the ideal woman that you

576
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:28,280
want to spend the rest of your life with. But that's not true. Life, life doesn't work like that.

577
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:35,320
You know, yeah, you could write a book, you could make some very smart, rationalistic arguments

578
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:40,120
and contrive them, you know, using some, using language, but in real life, and this is kind of

579
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:47,240
why I said, I spoke earlier about paying attention to one's subjective experience, one's deep,

580
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:57,880
personal being. Love is a risk. And, and, and I truly believe that there truly isn't any substance

581
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,240
to one's soul without risk and faith, which is why love takes courage for sure. But, but it also

582
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:09,320
takes a leap of faith. It's not a mere game or it's not a mere, it's not like a job interview

583
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,800
where you take some boxes and you work through some framework. It's, it's metaphysical, it's

584
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,720
spiritual, it's beyond that. And it's true that I think one truly becomes a complete person. It's

585
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:24,760
through that risk, through that character guardian leap of faith. And keep in mind character guard

586
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:30,600
never said, when you take the leap, the landing is soft. The landing can be terrible. Nevertheless,

587
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,960
one has to take the leap. And which is why it is not a, I'm not making a rational case here. You

588
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:41,960
might, everything I'm saying may, may sound like nonsense, but I guess I would say

589
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,880
don't even listen to what I'm saying, pay attention to what your heart's saying, pay attention to

590
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,400
where your heart's leading you. And that, that takes practice. It's not easy to be attentive,

591
00:57:53,400 --> 00:58:00,360
attentive to oneself. You know, I would also say another thing about hypergamy and women's

592
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:06,600
liberation. So firstly, I want to play this clip by Djejec. He talks about marriage. I think it's

593
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:15,320
a beautiful, beautiful clip from a recent interview he did. And, you know, Djejec also influenced

594
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:22,360
me to get this view of love. So one thing the Red Pearl community, all the Red Pearl bros say is

595
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:27,800
that because, you know, women are liberated now, you know, women don't have to rely on men.

596
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:35,880
Let's say for financial needs, women can earn as much as men want to earn. They can have their

597
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:41,560
own careers. They can have their own life. And therefore this whole concept of hypergamy,

598
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:48,200
it's probably not, it's probably, well, hypergamy still exists, but it's not how it probably

599
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:55,320
traditionally existed where women relied on men as being the providers, as being the breadwinners

600
00:58:55,320 --> 00:59:02,840
of a family, but rather men and women both have independence to fend for themselves.

601
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:09,960
And what Djejec says, which is fantastic, is that women's liberation has actually

602
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:15,160
has actually given way for genuine love. You know, and maybe this is a, there you go,

603
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,880
a good thing about capitalism because the free market has given that kind of freedom that

604
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:27,560
the liberation of the genders has given way for true genuine love where a man and woman can

605
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:32,040
be in a relationship, can get married if they truly love each other and for nothing else,

606
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:38,520
not for any financial benefit or not for any kind of, as I said, game in the sexual marketplace

607
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:44,680
or some game of hypergamy could truly be something metaphysical in that sense. And I want to make

608
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:49,160
this, play this clip by Djejec when he talks about marriage, which by the way for me

609
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:56,440
is the deepest manifestation of love. It's the most, maybe the highest thing one could do

610
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:01,240
symbolically to declare one's love. And here's what Djejec says.

611
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:09,000
I think that precisely because it no longer has this economic function. Marriage today

612
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,960
can be something beautiful. It's just a pure commitment. You say basically to society,

613
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:22,840
I care for this person more than for anybody else. I want to be, it's just for me,

614
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:33,400
it can survive marriage as a commitment to share a world with somebody. For me, okay, sex is beautiful,

615
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:39,960
passion at night, whatever. But as we all know, then when you awaken, no, there is a problem.

616
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:47,000
And here true love begins for me. You know, when you, it's not just we were all the night doing it,

617
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:53,800
but when you have to build patiently small daily rituals, daily life, who will clean the toilet?

618
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:59,720
Who will do this? Who will do that? All these wonderful small rituals. How do you prepare

619
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:07,880
breakfast? We go there. And that's for me the true miracle of marriage, this commitment of two.

620
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:13,480
That's why I also, maybe this will be disappointed to your readers. I don't believe in this fashionable

621
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,400
notion of polyamory. You know, oh, I can love more persons.

622
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:22,760
Any other relationship? I don't, I'm not a moralist. I don't care if people do it.

623
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:31,960
For me, but for me, there is still something absolutely exclusive about loving just one person.

624
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:39,240
Because, you know, because, how should I put it, when you have polyamory open relationships,

625
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:46,120
it's usually too pragmatic. It's, I have different needs. Let's say for intelligent talks or whatever,

626
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:53,320
I need you for intense sex. I need you for fun. I need you. That's not love for me. Love is not

627
01:01:53,320 --> 01:02:00,680
about satisfying your needs. Love is kind of a more metaphysical even, absolute trust. Love is,

628
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:06,680
I cannot live without you. And I'm ready to change radically just to be with you. In this sense,

629
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:15,800
I would say, I don't know what will happen. Just let's not get rid of marriage because

630
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:22,840
precisely today in our crazy world of all this, you know, the ideology today is experiment with

631
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:28,920
yourself. This is typical American ideology. Don't get fix on something. Different partners,

632
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:35,720
different sexual orientations. Today, you are heterosexual, make some homosexual experiments,

633
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:40,760
make some group orgy experiments and so on and so on. I don't find this satisfying.

634
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:49,560
Man, I can't even put into words how deeply I resonate with what Gijek's saying. I, you know,

635
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:54,920
I've never been on dating apps. And again, I'm not critical of dating apps. I know a lot of people

636
01:02:54,920 --> 01:03:01,880
who found great partners through dating apps. But the reason I never was on dating apps,

637
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,440
dating apps was because well, I was in a long term relationship for about two and a half years.

638
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:12,200
So I really need one. But other than that, even after I broke up with my ex-partner, I

639
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:18,440
pulled about it for a while. And then before I met my, you know, current, the current partner

640
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:25,000
during that period, interim period, let's say, I realized, I don't want to play that game where,

641
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,680
you know, as Gijek was saying, the game of experimentation, you know, I tried this woman,

642
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:37,320
I tried this woman, I tried this woman. It felt like, again, I was reducing women to just a mere

643
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:46,440
commodity and just a mere bunch of boxes or categories that I'm ticking off. And for me,

644
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:54,280
that's not what love is. For me, love is a risk. It's love is, it's a fall and love is painful.

645
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:59,560
But one, one must experience all of life as that, as that poem by

646
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:08,280
Eurelke goes, actually, let me pull it up the poem. I've got the poem, actually, I think I've got it on my,

647
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:16,920
I've got it saved up. Let's see. Oh, I don't want to show any of my, let me just switch the camera

648
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:25,000
because this is my personal notion. It's this poem called, Go to the Limits of Your Belonging by

649
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:31,720
Ren and Marie Eurelke. And there's one verse in the poem that goes, let everything happen to you,

650
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:39,080
beauty and terror, just keep going, no feeling is final, don't let yourself lose me. I love that

651
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:44,440
idea of let everything happen to you. And I think it's in love, everything happens to a person,

652
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:52,920
the good, the bad, the ugly. So in any case, my point being, all of these subcultures, as I've

653
01:04:53,560 --> 01:05:01,240
said many times, not probably ad nauseam, have their utility. They really do. But the way to

654
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:06,120
truly utilize these subcultures, the Red Bull Movement, the Manisphere, even, you know, books like

655
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:13,320
this, like by Rolo Tamasi on dating and meeting them, which again, great advice, is by having a

656
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:20,360
sort of paradigm shift. And it's essentially a philosophical paradigm shift of looking, of how

657
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:26,840
we as individuals look at other individuals and other women. I'm just being specific to the

658
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:32,840
whole dating thing and how we look at other people as souls and how we experience love.

659
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:40,120
And I would even say this, you see, this whole podcast, I'm essentially giving a irrational

660
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:46,440
message because I'm telling to let people make mistakes. I'm telling let people even experience

661
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:53,240
misery by the mistakes they make without prescribing an ideology onto them. That's what I truly

662
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:59,480
believe. I think that's what truly develops the human soul and truly gives person the vast array

663
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:04,920
of the human experience. Because if not, we're perpetually going to be stuck. Not if not, we

664
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:10,760
actually are always perpetually stuck in a yes or problem. Yes, we have a bunch of facts,

665
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:17,320
but we derive the odd from it. That's the important part. How do we derive the odd from the yes?

666
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:24,680
And ideology will say easy, just view the odd or derive the odd through this framework and it's

667
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:33,160
done. It requires no risk. It requires no thinking. It requires no experience. But I think that leaves

668
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:41,000
a person empty and it makes one's life rather insipid to be frank. Thanks for listening.
