00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
when I was reading that chapter and listening to your lecture

00:04.000 --> 00:07.280
on the set theoretic multiverse, obviously my head went to the

00:07.280 --> 00:11.600
current sort of ongoing debate on the the multiverse theory or the

00:11.600 --> 00:15.760
let's call the interpretation in quantum mechanics or in physics

00:15.760 --> 00:20.560
or I see yeah I'm so because according to my understanding

00:20.560 --> 00:24.160
what you're putting forward with like the set theoretic multiverses

00:24.160 --> 00:29.600
these separate multiverses or let's call it

00:29.600 --> 00:33.120
axiomatic systems for different worlds of set theory

00:33.120 --> 00:37.920
they can still talk to each other whereas I there are still correlations

00:37.920 --> 00:41.040
let's call it whereas I don't think that's the

00:41.040 --> 00:43.840
argument someone like a Sean Carroll would make

00:43.840 --> 00:48.000
when it comes to physics where there's this reality there's another reality

00:48.000 --> 00:54.160
so speaking ontologically are you are you claiming that like

00:54.160 --> 00:57.360
the nature let's say the ontology of mathematics is that

00:57.360 --> 01:02.320
yes there are some universes where the continuum hypothesis

01:02.320 --> 01:07.760
is it works and in some it doesn't do they have relations or are they

01:07.760 --> 01:12.240
completely independent realities if that makes sense

01:12.240 --> 01:16.560
so that's a good question so I guess I have a few things to say about it

01:16.560 --> 01:21.040
so first I think it's probably important to

01:21.040 --> 01:25.520
there's this unfortunate overlap in the term multiverse

01:25.680 --> 01:28.880
there's this whole physical multiverse theory that you were

01:28.880 --> 01:33.440
alluding to which I don't think of as connected at all

01:33.440 --> 01:37.680
with this sort of debate on pluralism in mathematics it's just a totally separate

01:37.680 --> 01:41.680
topic so for example the physical version is connected

01:41.680 --> 01:44.640
with you know superposition of worlds and whether they can interact and so on

01:44.640 --> 01:47.280
and I think that's part of what your question was about

01:47.280 --> 01:50.480
and there are versions of those phenomenon in the set theoretic

01:50.480 --> 01:54.320
multiverse but but I don't think of the set theoretic multiverse as connected

01:54.320 --> 01:58.080
at all with any of those physical theories it's just a different topic

01:58.080 --> 02:01.840
it has you know there's a family resemblance because it's about many

02:01.840 --> 02:05.120
different mathematical worlds and the physical one is about many

02:05.120 --> 02:09.360
different physical worlds but I think that's the end of the

02:09.360 --> 02:13.200
family resemblance and I don't I'm not claiming or

02:13.200 --> 02:17.840
positing any kind of uh deeper connection between the sort of

02:17.840 --> 02:22.080
set theoretic pluralism kinds of multiverse and these physics theories

02:22.080 --> 02:25.360
that talk about a multiverse I think they're just totally different

02:25.360 --> 02:29.600
topics but in terms of whether there's interaction I

02:29.600 --> 02:32.960
think that's extremely and extremely profound philosophical question

02:32.960 --> 02:37.280
on the mathematical side which is where most of my work is

02:37.280 --> 02:43.440
namely so we have these different models of set theory

02:43.440 --> 02:46.880
and the method of forcing and and there is a way

02:46.880 --> 02:52.720
that a one model of set theory can somehow get access to the forcing

02:52.720 --> 02:57.840
extensions because the the the ground model the smaller model

02:57.840 --> 03:01.360
has names for all the individuals that exist in the

03:01.360 --> 03:04.160
forcing extension this is one of the ways that forcing works

03:04.160 --> 03:08.160
we have this concept of having a name and then we have this forcing relation

03:08.160 --> 03:12.240
which tells which expresses in the ground model sort of the

03:12.240 --> 03:16.400
truth conditions of what could be true or might be true in the forcing

03:16.400 --> 03:20.560
extension and this is a degree of access to the extension

03:20.560 --> 03:27.120
and and so it is it like it's not just this kind of pure s5

03:27.120 --> 03:31.200
model situation where we have these totally separate set theoretic worlds

03:31.200 --> 03:33.760
that don't have any connection with one another

03:33.760 --> 03:37.760
and when you move from one another they cannot see each other or

03:37.760 --> 03:41.840
it's not like that at all rather every model of set theory can

03:41.840 --> 03:45.760
look down you know inwardly at the inner models that are defined

03:45.760 --> 03:49.840
inside it for example this is how girdle proved the consistency of ch

03:49.840 --> 03:55.600
he said well take any model of cfc and then inside that model define what's

03:55.600 --> 03:59.280
called the constructible universe which is a kind of

03:59.280 --> 04:04.080
constructible version of the cumulative universe where you only add the bare

04:04.080 --> 04:09.680
minimum at each step you iterate along and whenever you've got a sort of set

04:09.680 --> 04:13.120
that you've built so far then any subset of it that's definable

04:13.120 --> 04:16.800
in that piece you add that at the next level and so you keep

04:16.800 --> 04:20.880
iterating this definable power set operation this was

04:20.880 --> 04:26.640
girdle's uh a genius idea then you get this

04:26.640 --> 04:31.600
inner model of set theory and he proved that all the cfc axioms are true

04:31.600 --> 04:35.520
there including the axiom of choice even if it wasn't true outside

04:35.520 --> 04:39.360
and the continuum hypothesis also and that's how he proved the relative

04:39.360 --> 04:43.840
consistency of the continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice

04:43.840 --> 04:47.840
by showing that inside any model of cfc there's this

04:47.840 --> 04:53.680
deeper model called the constructible universe that satisfies dfc plus ch

04:53.680 --> 04:57.040
and the forcing extension idea is looking sort of

04:57.040 --> 05:00.960
outwardly it's a it's a measure of access that a model has

05:00.960 --> 05:04.960
to the larger models they can't have fully complete access

05:04.960 --> 05:08.720
and one can refute the idea you know there has to

05:08.720 --> 05:12.880
have to be certain kinds of limits but there is some kind of access

05:12.880 --> 05:16.240
and and i find that just fascinating when

05:16.240 --> 05:20.320
the i mean it's a deeply metaphysical

05:20.320 --> 05:24.480
issue about these sort of possible mathematical worlds with different

05:24.480 --> 05:30.160
truths and yet the because these worlds these

05:30.160 --> 05:33.600
mathematical worlds have by by means of the forcing

05:33.600 --> 05:37.120
relation this definable access to these other worlds

05:37.120 --> 05:40.880
they become mathematical questions with precise answers and you can prove

05:40.880 --> 05:44.720
theorems about it and and so it's fascinating when

05:44.720 --> 05:50.400
these deeply philosophical metaphysical mathematical metaphysics

05:50.400 --> 05:54.960
questions turn into mathematical theorems and maybe it comes back to the

05:54.960 --> 05:59.120
first question that you asked me it's really showing the way that these

05:59.120 --> 06:03.920
philosophical issues come directly into the mathematics
