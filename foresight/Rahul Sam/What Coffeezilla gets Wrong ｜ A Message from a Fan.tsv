0	5680	Hey everyone, I just want to make this quick video for one of my favorite
5680	11000	YouTubers and people on the internet right now, coffeezilla, a message from a
11000	15520	fan. I love his work. I think he's one of the most important people on the
15520	20080	internet right now. He's doing true journalism, exposing these scams and
20080	25800	just it's to a almost bizarre and absurd level when a normal guy like me just
25800	31240	sees them and it's unbelievable. And I think he's in great work. He is
31240	36960	extremely insightful, he's brilliant, he works hard and what he creates, his
36960	40920	content is of true value to society. I truly believe that and I'm not trying to
40920	45720	you know blow steam up your ass, I mean sincerely. However, saying all that, saying
45720	51520	all that, here comes the jab jab and the right hook. I do think he makes a huge
51520	55840	mistake. I think he gets one point room, especially when I see him on
55840	62000	podcasts, on huge podcasts like Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan. He portrays all
62000	69160	these scams as being anomalies to the current neoliberal capitalistic order. He
69160	72200	in fact even says that I'm a capitalism, there's really nothing wrong with
72200	76320	capitalism, it's just these things are the anomalies. And I think he makes a
76320	82440	mistake there. I think the best way to portray it is to in fact understand that
82440	88400	these scams are built into the, are built into capitalism itself. They're built
88400	93280	into the antagonisms, the deadlocks, the consumerism, the desires that capitalism
93280	99000	creates and these scams aren't anomalies and they'll only keep getting worse in
99000	105040	the current economic system and the current ideological system we live in. So
105080	110840	look, if he's interested in Epshrew's theory, I would highly recommend him read
110840	118200	anything by Slavoj Džek. Essentially any of these books probably start with the
118200	122920	plague of fantasies, but if he really wants to get some some heavy stuff,
122920	130560	perhaps start with Karl Marx's capital. Now don't get me wrong, while I am an
130560	134320	anti-capitalist, I'm not saying that Marxism is the answer. I don't know what
134320	138320	the answer is to be honest, but sometimes it's not even the answers itself, but
138320	142600	it's the questions that count and perhaps we should start questioning why do
142600	147280	these scams come up every couple of years and why is it, why does it seem like
147280	152160	things are getting worse for the middle class? Why does it seem like we're in the
152160	155680	midst of an ecological crisis and in the midst of a mental health crisis, in the
155680	161040	midst of a almost existential crisis for most people where there are terms like
161360	166880	debts of despair and those questions are perhaps important asking and maybe it is
166880	172200	because of our current ideological system, our current hegemonic system of
172200	177840	capitalism and all these scams, they never really aren't going to go away.
177840	183360	It doesn't matter how many scams Coffizula exposes, as long as things
183360	187840	remain the way they are, they'll still unfortunately still keep coming up and
188480	195280	in fact, probably even get worse. I do like the joke by Slavo Žižek where it's this kind of naive,
195280	198720	I'm not saying Coffizula is naive, I'm saying all of us, we're all naive, we have this
199600	204720	naive hope that there's a light at the end of the tunnel and then Žižek says,
204720	211200	oh, that light is in fact an oncoming train. So in fact, we make structural changes.
211200	217040	Yes, it's important to make changes in individual action and certainly do things
217040	222960	like what Coffizula does where we expose these scams, expose these frauds and even
222960	228240	partake in local communities and try to not get people caught up in MLM schemes or pyramid schemes
228240	234640	or Ponzi schemes or whatnot and all these little games that are that are imbued out of capitalism,
234640	241120	but still we have to make a structural critique and I think given Coffizula is currently
241120	245600	extremely influential and we all know how internet fame works, there's a rice,
245600	249760	you got to make good use of it and then it goes away and people just kind of forget about you,
249760	256640	but at this moment he can really embrace the opportunity and use his platform to show that
256640	262080	no, these scams aren't anomalies, they in fact are built into our system itself.
263520	272000	Simply that's what I want to say and I would highly recommend watching lectures by Žižek on
272000	278480	this matter or even Žižek is a bit too, because he comes from a very theoretical abstract angle
279200	285280	reading a book like Capital by Piketty, where yes Piketty for me isn't radical enough,
285280	293040	but still he does make some good points as to why we in fact are in deep shit
293920	296480	and we need to make some fundamental changes in society.
296480	300480	Okay, I talk too much, I shall let you go. Cheers.
