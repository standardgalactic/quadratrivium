0	6000	I completely got your critiques of predictive processing, which I concur with, but what are
6000	11760	your views on something like the free energy principle by Carl Friston, who, after all,
11760	16800	is a neuroscientist. Would you say it's a good model of framework to work with?
18160	25440	No, I think it's a bogus analogy. It's obviously an analogy because the term comes from physics.
26000	29920	In free energy, there's a perfectly well-understood idea where energy is the
29920	33920	capacity to work, and free energy is the energy that's available in the current
33920	39200	contest to do work. Great idea, really important. So what's the free energy principle? Well,
39840	44240	people who are big fans of predictive processing have worked their butts off to try to figure out
44240	49120	what it is. And Friston's a horrible writer. He writes with incredible obscurity. He writes
49120	52880	like a postmodernist, actually, kind of postmodernist mathematician. And that's not what
52960	57840	mathematics is supposed to be like. Mathematics is incredibly powerful because it's clear,
57840	63120	and you can see what's going on. But his math is unclear, and the free energy principle
63760	67840	is what I call a bogus analogy. The term comes from my book, Balance. I wrote a book on balance
67840	72880	a couple of years ago, and it talks both about the neuroscience of balance, but it also talks
72880	78960	about the way balance has become a metaphor that pervades human thought. But different
78960	82800	metaphors have different values. Metaphors aren't all good. Some of them are really evil.
82800	89280	They can be used to defend slavery, for example. So your question is, what kind of metaphor have
89280	96960	we got here? Is it one that's good or unclear or utterly bogus? Well, here, I think it's bogus
96960	102160	because he's trying to carry over from physics some sense of profundity from free energy.
102160	106160	But if you look what he means by that, as much or far as anyone's been able to figure it out,
106160	110080	and people like Anil Seth have tried to figure out what he meant by it, you say, well, it's just
110080	114480	another way of saying predictive processing. So I'm trying to say that what the brain is doing
114480	120640	is to make predictions about the future in order to figure out what's likely to happen and satisfy
120640	127280	its goals. So that's not a reasonable idea. It's a real hypothesis, and I think it's one of the
127280	135200	six things that brains do. But to elevate that into a free energy principle using a bogus physical
136000	142320	expression for physics, as I think is frankly illegitimate. It's not a good use of metaphor.
142320	148720	It's not a good use of analogy. It's a highly misleading term that is pseudo profundity.
150000	153280	It's kind of like, actually, among the post-modernists you mentioned, I don't think
155280	161280	Foucault is bogus. I think he's actually got a lot of insights into the way society works. But a lot
161360	167200	of the other people in that category, Derrida and often Cizek, they really just don't understand
167200	174080	the difference between obscurity and profundity. So that is, you should be able to figure out,
174080	179280	what are they saying? Is it true or is it false? And you can do that often with Foucault. You can
179280	184400	do that with good cognitive scientists. But the idea of free energy is just so kind of obscure
184400	189360	that it's hard to make sense of it. And I think actually the predictive processing idea is clear
189360	194480	enough that you can see that it's not true. Because as I said, the mind does a lot of other
194480	199520	things besides prediction. And it does it by means other than Bayesian processing. So predictive
199520	204880	processing is an idea that's interesting but wrong. Whereas free energy is an idea that's just
204880	213200	too obscure to be even wrong. I see, because as a layperson, my confusion always with the free
213200	217760	energy principle was I saw what Professor Friston was getting. And in fact, I'm currently reading
217760	223920	his book Active Inference. But as a meta theory, as like a theory of mind that encompasses what
223920	229840	the mind is, I always felt it lacked certain other parts of what the mind does. Like for instance,
229840	236640	coherence, explanatory coherence. And emotion for evaluation. And appraisal and communication
236640	240800	with others. You need all of these things. If you're going to have a full theory of mind,
240800	247440	it's really just got one tiny corner. It commits something that I've called Thaley's disease.
248240	252240	Thaley's was really the first philosopher and the first scientist. Absolutely brilliant thinker.
252240	256560	But he came up with a theory that was just a little too simple. His theory is everything is
256560	263280	water. Well, that was brilliant. It's absolutely simple. But even by Aristotelian standards,
263280	267520	whether you also need earth, air, and fire, it just didn't cut it. And of course, now that we
267520	273360	know there's 118 different elements. No, it doesn't work. So what I call Thaley's disease is coming
273360	278080	up with a theory that looks brilliantly simple, but it's just way too simple. And that's definitely
278080	280080	true of predictive processing as well.
