WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Okay, so to get the ball rolling, as they say, I'm going to read off

00:06.400 --> 00:13.200
Adiga's, uh, the question concerning technology, although, although it's very important, a caveat,

00:13.200 --> 00:18.560
Adiga was a serious Nazi. So whenever you read him, you need to have that in the back of your mind.

00:18.560 --> 00:24.160
He wasn't some kind of peripheral Nazi. No, no, no, he was deeply involved with the Nazi party.

00:24.160 --> 00:30.400
He was an ideological Nazi. And, you know, I even read this good analysis of Adiga that in many

00:30.400 --> 00:38.640
ways he was a metaphysical and SMI, not just the kind of the, you know, run-of-the-mill and SMI

00:38.640 --> 00:43.520
in Germany during World War II. He was a legit and SMI. So it was a Nazi. So whenever we read him,

00:44.160 --> 00:51.200
we need to keep that in mind. Regardless, I personally think one of his best essays I've ever

00:51.200 --> 00:59.120
read is the question concerning technology, which he does an analysis, a metaphysical analysis of

00:59.120 --> 01:07.440
technology. So I'm going to read really two tiny excerpts from that essay, and then we'll go from

01:07.440 --> 01:16.960
there. So here's what he says. Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology.

01:17.920 --> 01:25.440
Whether we passionately affirm or deny it, but we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way

01:25.440 --> 01:32.000
when we regard it as something neutral. So that's a really important point. For this conception of it,

01:32.000 --> 01:38.720
to which today we are particularly like to pay homage, make us utterly blind to the essence of

01:38.720 --> 01:43.280
technology. This is essentially in the second paragraph of the essay. So he starts off like

01:43.440 --> 01:47.600
that. And then this is the important bit for me, at least, which I thought was really

01:48.000 --> 01:56.080
perspicacious. He says, yeah, we're questioning concerning technology, and we have arrived now

01:56.080 --> 02:01.600
at alater, which is a Greek term, which means, well, it translates to add revealing.

02:03.040 --> 02:09.520
What has the essence of technology to do with revealing? The answer, everything. For every

02:09.600 --> 02:17.760
bringing forth is grounded in revealing. Bringing forth indeed gathers within itself

02:18.480 --> 02:24.800
the four modes of occasioning, causality, and the rules, and rules them through throughout.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.400
So the four modes he discusses as in his essay, we don't know how to get to that,

02:28.400 --> 02:30.320
but the important bit is about revealing.

02:31.040 --> 02:41.360
What's that? He writes in such a weird way, man. It's so hard to read how to go.

02:41.360 --> 02:49.840
Within its domain, belong and means as well as instrumentality. Okay. I don't know what the

02:49.840 --> 02:55.600
sentence means. Ignore that. Instrumentality is considered to be the fundamental characteristic

02:55.600 --> 03:03.600
of technology. If we inquire step by step what technology represented as means actually is,

03:04.800 --> 03:11.280
then we shall arrive at revealing. The possibility of all productive manufacturing

03:11.280 --> 03:15.600
lies in revealing. And now this is perhaps the most important little excerpt.

03:16.800 --> 03:24.800
Technology is therefore no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing. If we give heat to this,

03:24.880 --> 03:29.520
then another whole realm for the essence of technology will open itself up to us.

03:30.320 --> 03:37.360
It is in the realm of revealing, i.e. of truth. So after reading this a couple of times, my first

03:37.360 --> 03:44.160
insight and the way I connected this to kind of techno-optimism and tech bros of our time is,

03:46.000 --> 03:52.320
I feel like a lot of us, at least tacitly, view technology as a means to an end. A lot of tech

03:52.320 --> 03:57.120
bros think of it as some kind of, as Heidegger says, instrumentality. It's a way to get things

03:57.120 --> 04:04.560
done purely pragmatic, utilitarian kind of way of viewing. However, actually I have some notes here

04:04.560 --> 04:11.760
which I took down. That bit about instrument, sorry, that bit about revealing shows that

04:11.760 --> 04:19.280
technology is not a mere instrument. It's rather a way that truth reveals itself to us. And when I

04:19.280 --> 04:24.320
mean truth, I don't mean truth in like a scientific empirical sense, like facts of, let's say, the

04:24.320 --> 04:31.440
physical world, but rather truths of being as such. So the brilliant insight Heidegger had

04:31.440 --> 04:36.720
in the 20th century, which I think revolutionized philosophy afterwards, at least so-called

04:36.720 --> 04:41.360
colonial philosophy, is that he showed that, you know, truth isn't something that just

04:42.560 --> 04:47.520
kind of prima facie just presents itself to us. It's always something that's revealed through

04:47.520 --> 04:54.560
us, a subject, or as he calls it, a design. And then he used that kind of concept that truth is always

04:55.760 --> 05:00.880
something that's filtered through a framework or framework, again, reduces it to some kind of like

05:00.880 --> 05:05.920
algorithm. It's not in that sense. Rather, it's a, through a mode of being, through an orientation,

05:05.920 --> 05:12.880
let's say. He extrapolated that idea to every other part of being. So technology, art,

05:13.840 --> 05:19.280
obviously history and whatnot. This essays our technology. So the first thing is,

05:20.560 --> 05:26.400
technology is not a means to an end. It is much more deep and much more profound. It's essence,

05:26.400 --> 05:33.520
it makes metaphysical claims, which means technology deeply profoundly changes who we

05:33.520 --> 05:38.000
as human beings. And that's not an eye-opener, especially with social media. People just accept

05:38.080 --> 05:44.000
that kind of, now it's like, it's a given, right? Although it's not just in the sense of our social

05:44.000 --> 05:50.720
reality, but our metaphysics, our values itself changes with technology. And then the other critique

05:50.720 --> 05:56.000
of, let's say, tech bros or tech broism is that, you know, there's this kind of naive optimism,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.640
which I'm going to talk about, where there's like this assumption we have that, oh,

06:01.440 --> 06:06.880
technology is good just for the sake of technology. So it's just kind of, if we keep

06:08.080 --> 06:12.400
advancing and developing our technologies, that's just good for its sake. It's not so simple.

06:13.440 --> 06:19.760
What Heidegger talks about this thing called, yeah, so he has technology as revealing,

06:19.760 --> 06:24.800
but then he also has this thing called enframing, which, okay, I hate to be the

06:24.800 --> 06:29.200
annoying leftist that blames everything on capitalism, but I'm going to be that annoying leftist.

06:29.200 --> 06:38.240
And framing us, we start viewing other human beings also as technical objects, as resources to

06:38.240 --> 06:46.400
be exploited, case in point, human resources. So in that sense, the technological metaphysics

06:46.400 --> 06:52.800
have become our metaphysics. We view other human beings as means to an ends, as things

06:52.800 --> 07:00.400
to be optimized, utilized, to be used, to be technically exploited, certainly in capitalism.

07:00.400 --> 07:06.880
And, you know, a good example is when the whole, as we are going through the current AI revolution,

07:06.880 --> 07:11.680
when the whole, you know, with open AI, a judge if anything came off, the first question, a lot of

07:12.720 --> 07:19.600
the first kind of spontaneous reaction most people have is, oh, what's it going to do to this job,

07:19.600 --> 07:24.160
to marketing that job? What's it going to do to the economy? But rarely did we ask,

07:24.800 --> 07:30.240
what is it going to do to the human subject as such? And I think the reason we asked that

07:30.240 --> 07:34.720
previous question, not the latter one, the reason we asked, oh, what's it going to do to our economy?

07:34.720 --> 07:41.360
What's it going to do to, I don't know, different kinds of jobs is because again, we human beings,

07:41.360 --> 07:47.760
because we have this kind of technical metaphysics, we view human beings as agents of capital.

07:47.760 --> 07:54.400
Simply, that's all we have. We just, you know, we trade and we pretty much move around capital.

07:54.960 --> 08:00.560
So the most important thing isn't the human being, but what the human being is useful.

08:01.840 --> 08:07.520
And that's my critique of tech bros, who kind of, they have this kind of like

08:07.520 --> 08:12.640
massive optimism where technology will liberate us. It's typically on a tower of

08:12.640 --> 08:16.880
Babel from the Bible, right? Typically, it'll liberate us. It'll be a saving grace.

08:17.600 --> 08:22.960
And it's good just for its sake. And in many ways, the human being doesn't even matter what

08:22.960 --> 08:29.120
matters is the technology as such. And that is something. So by the way, Heidegger was not

08:29.120 --> 08:33.280
a Luddite. He was not saying technology is bad. I think the best way to read Heidegger is through

08:33.280 --> 08:39.760
the Hegelian lens and be like, okay, we need to see technology for what it is with its

08:39.760 --> 08:44.560
contradictions. And I'm not saying that's, oh, you see the good and bad and you kind of weigh

08:44.560 --> 08:49.040
out the pros and cons and get the pros. It doesn't work like that. Heidegger's point is more,

08:49.920 --> 08:56.480
more, I'd say more solemn even, that we, with the good, the bad comes,

08:58.240 --> 09:02.960
the bad comes along. It's concomitant to the good. We can't have our cake and eat it too.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.120
That's the point Heidegger makes, in my opinion. And I think that's the best way to read his essay

09:07.120 --> 09:15.200
on technology. Yeah, saying all that, Yun, right? I said a lot there, but the flow's yours.

09:16.560 --> 09:21.840
Yeah. Well, you know, I agree. And I have the same kind of orientation or like

09:23.920 --> 09:29.920
views on technology. And so I think what I can do is kind of build on what you've said.

09:32.560 --> 09:36.240
But first of all, yeah, like Heidegger's take on technology, I think is a really,

09:36.240 --> 09:42.080
really important one, right? Like, I think he sees very deeply, you could call him a prophet

09:42.080 --> 09:47.200
in his sense, because he wrote the book in like 1950. Was it 1950, 1900, something like that?

09:47.200 --> 09:52.320
The essay? No, 1950. I don't know when the essay was published. In fact, you keep going. I'll find

09:52.320 --> 09:56.240
out when it was published. Yeah, it was early enough. But he saw through these things that,

09:57.120 --> 10:03.360
that like he basically saw through how much of an impact to use a simple word, you know, like

10:03.680 --> 10:09.760
exactly, exactly 1950. He hit the nail on the head. Yeah, that's, that's great. But he, he saw all

10:09.760 --> 10:14.240
of this before any of it happened, right? Like in 1950, the world doesn't look like how it did

10:14.240 --> 10:19.520
today, but he saw all of this coming. But I think one of the main points again, I want to

10:19.520 --> 10:26.800
reiterate is like, an interesting thing here, I think is, I think, Raul, you made a few

10:28.240 --> 10:33.040
points around like tech bros and like techno optimism. I think in this context on what,

10:33.280 --> 10:36.560
what everything Heidegger is writing about, you can kind of extrapolate that to kind of

10:37.840 --> 10:41.920
the whole generation, at least the whole new generation, because they're all brought up within

10:41.920 --> 10:47.360
this setting, right? Like technology is inherently a part of the new generation. So in a way like

10:47.360 --> 10:52.160
tech bros have this kind of techno optimism view. But I think it's inherent in everyone who

10:52.160 --> 10:57.840
grows up, everyone who grew up in this kind of way of being, right? Which is times our religion.

10:58.640 --> 11:04.800
Yeah. So I think the important point to make is that it's one of those things now technology is

11:04.800 --> 11:12.240
one of those things now where it's, it's so deeply, it's so deeply encapsulated our ways of thinking.

11:12.880 --> 11:17.520
And I think here it's probably more accurate to say the Western way of thinking that you don't

11:17.520 --> 11:25.520
even notice it. Like no, like people on the street wouldn't be conscious, nearly conscious of like

11:25.520 --> 11:29.840
what sort of effect technology is happening to them. And I think that's kind of the real baseline

11:29.840 --> 11:37.840
idea we kind of trying to, trying to like expound on as well, right? Because as you mentioned,

11:37.840 --> 11:43.600
and like from Heidegger, it's technology is not morally neutral, right? And this is what most people

11:43.600 --> 11:49.600
think. It's not just tech bros, it's kind of most Gen Zs, even most parents, I'd say, although they

11:49.600 --> 11:54.000
have more like more of a conscious idea of like what life was like before technology. I think most

11:54.000 --> 11:59.920
people will, I think it's most, it's rather acceptable for lots of people nowadays to say

11:59.920 --> 12:06.560
technology is neutral and it's just a means to an end. But as you mentioned, like that's kind of

12:06.560 --> 12:10.320
missing like a lot of the point, right? Technology has a fundamental essence to it. There's a

12:10.320 --> 12:17.280
fundamental, fundamental metaphysics to technology. And when you pause it, when you think technology

12:17.280 --> 12:24.880
is just a means to kind of missing the deeper picture. And like, as you mentioned, one of the

12:24.880 --> 12:31.600
ways in which, in which it's affecting us, like the essence is in terms of how we view people,

12:31.600 --> 12:36.320
right? Like we view people as resources, we view nature as resources. And in a sense, it's kind

12:36.320 --> 12:41.760
of like the critique of technology is somewhat similar to a critique of capitalism, right?

12:41.760 --> 12:46.560
As more people might be familiar with. And I think that's fine, because like, if you think about it,

12:46.560 --> 12:52.800
I think like capitalism thrives on technology, right? Like, in a capitalist society, what are

12:52.800 --> 13:00.560
you looking for? Like, efficiency of production, something like that, right? Like, if you want to

13:00.560 --> 13:05.920
excel as a company, as a producer, as a whatever, like what you're trying to do, you're trying to

13:05.920 --> 13:12.880
produce more, more efficiently. And basically, technology, technological innovation is kind

13:12.880 --> 13:16.960
of what drives it. And so I think you can't really divorce technology, a critique of technology and

13:16.960 --> 13:20.160
a critique of capitalism. So you can kind of treat everything we're discussing as kind of

13:20.160 --> 13:26.560
interchangeable in this respect. But that's it, right? It's this very deep and trench thing that

13:26.560 --> 13:31.760
we're trying to kind of expound on. And like, we're trying to discuss the revelation that it's had

13:31.760 --> 13:41.440
that everyone like kind of sees past nowadays. And I suppose the biggest, the biggest

13:43.600 --> 13:48.160
threat or the biggest, the biggest kind of effect I see these days is

13:50.640 --> 13:53.520
from my point of view, and then we can kind of launch into kind of a couple of different

13:53.520 --> 13:58.800
points, because there's a lot out here as well. The biggest point of view, I think, is that people

13:58.880 --> 14:05.440
are, there is like the fundamental metaphysical idea behind technology is also a form of

14:06.640 --> 14:11.280
self-worship. It's a form of, it's a form of like,

14:13.840 --> 14:18.160
from a Nietzschean point of view, like the Nietzschean idea is like a revaluation of values,

14:18.800 --> 14:27.760
right? And so what technology is, is basically an attempt to create like a new order. It's an attempt

14:27.760 --> 14:33.600
to create a new order in which, you know, human nature or man is mechanized in different ways,

14:33.600 --> 14:37.280
let's say, like you can impose a rational order on the way we do things and make it more efficient.

14:38.960 --> 14:46.640
And I think you could then kind of interpret like the whole movement of technology

14:46.640 --> 14:51.600
being techno-optimism, kind of somewhat similar to scientism, right? It's this idea that, you know,

14:52.320 --> 14:56.480
we are our own gods and we can decide whatever the world should look like, we can do whatever we want.

14:57.360 --> 15:05.360
And our goal here is to kind of overcome nature, but then in doing so, like there are a couple of,

15:05.360 --> 15:09.840
there are lots of risks, right? Like we kind of overcome nature, then we overcome ourselves,

15:09.840 --> 15:15.280
we overcome ourselves, right? Like, and that's the point you raise with human resources as well,

15:15.280 --> 15:22.400
right? Because once you see nature as something to be overcome or something to be used as a

15:22.400 --> 15:27.760
resource, what's stopping you from seeing a human, right? As something to be like something to use

15:27.760 --> 15:32.560
as a resource and something to like kind of have power over, it's all, it kind of all exists within

15:32.560 --> 15:42.640
the same framework. And so I think the two things that kind of comes to mind firstly is

15:43.280 --> 15:48.400
where this is all taking us, because there is a kind of development, there's a development to

15:48.480 --> 15:55.440
technology, right? Like it doesn't just end with us having, being in a utopia, it's never that simple,

15:55.440 --> 16:01.600
right? And here if I want to bring it down to kind of the ground level of practical, on a more

16:01.600 --> 16:09.520
practical level, right? I think there's a lot of simple kind of simple ways, like you don't even

16:09.520 --> 16:12.960
have to talk about philosophy. There's lots of simple ways now where people are beginning to

16:12.960 --> 16:20.560
detect like certain faults or effects in which technology is putting us all at risk, right?

16:21.280 --> 16:27.600
And a simple example is like Jonathan Hyde, he's a sociologist. He talks a lot about the risk of

16:27.600 --> 16:32.960
social media and what it's doing to humanity. It's not morally neutral in that sense. And if we're

16:32.960 --> 16:37.600
going to go down the road, the route of social media, it's not a morally neutral route where it's

16:38.320 --> 16:44.960
a pure means in which we are just doing whatever, like we're just using technology for our own sake,

16:44.960 --> 16:51.120
right? Like it's doing something to us as well. And I like what CS Lewis said, I think it was in

16:51.120 --> 16:57.120
the abolishment of man. Let me try and find a quote. He said this, each new power won by man

16:57.120 --> 17:03.120
is a power over man as well. In every victory, besides being the general who triumphs, he is

17:03.120 --> 17:09.840
also the prisoner who follows the triumphal cup. Beautiful quote. And so you're being, you're kind of

17:11.600 --> 17:18.000
the more you kind of overpower nature, you overpower kind of everything, right? You're not,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.440
you're also being taken along for the right. You're in a way a prisoner of what's being done.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.120
Yeah, yeah. Actually, can we revisit that quote because that was a really good quote. I think,

17:25.840 --> 17:29.920
you know, CS Lewis and I, for me, he's a bit too conservative, but I think he's a brilliant thinker.

17:30.160 --> 17:35.920
Isn't it really interesting that you brought up Jonathan Hyde and social media and then you

17:35.920 --> 17:44.240
quoted CS Lewis because social media perhaps is the quintessential example to exemplify that quote.

17:44.240 --> 17:48.480
It shows the inherent contradiction in social media because think about social media.

17:48.480 --> 17:54.000
Its promise was we're going to be global citizens. We're all going to be connected. We're all going

17:54.080 --> 18:00.720
to be knowing what's going on. And it's just this beautiful utopian liberal dream, isn't it?

18:00.720 --> 18:07.040
But then CS Lewis would be laughing at that and saying, oh, look, now we've become slaves and then

18:07.040 --> 18:14.720
slave to social media. And this thing that was supposed to liberate us ended up enslaving us.

18:14.720 --> 18:19.840
And I think that's where he points out that, I don't know, I know he's coming from a very kind

18:20.160 --> 18:27.280
of Christian perspective and that's completely fine. So am I in many ways, but I think what's

18:27.280 --> 18:31.920
more perspicacious is that him pointing out the contradiction in what social media is.

18:31.920 --> 18:37.680
It's what it promised and what it became. No, 100%. And yeah, that's where that's what I was going to.

18:37.680 --> 18:44.240
So like to finish my point, it's where we're at now. Technology has done something to us. It's not

18:44.240 --> 18:50.240
morally neutral by any means. And one of the ways that this is reviewed is there are lots of

18:50.240 --> 18:56.080
simple practical ways in which people are becoming more conscious. But also, I think it's quite clear

18:56.080 --> 19:03.120
that going more and more further and more deeply down this path, it's not a utopia we're kind of

19:03.120 --> 19:09.120
ending up with. It's something weird. And there are lots of words that people use that are quite

19:09.120 --> 19:16.160
interesting. I like the word, I think Paul King's north as well. He used this word, like we're all

19:16.160 --> 19:23.440
kind of entering into a hyper reality. Yeah. Oh, John Baudrillard hyper reality. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.880
Like I really like that word, right? We're not, it's not like when you talk about utopia, that's

19:26.880 --> 19:32.400
kind of the thing that techno optimists look at, right? They romanticize the idea of technology,

19:32.400 --> 19:38.400
really they romanticize the idea of innovation and like overcoming nature and overcoming like

19:38.400 --> 19:42.640
human nature even, right? Like when I see human nature, I mean, like the limitations, supposedly.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.400
But what that doesn't include is this whole, you know,

19:50.000 --> 19:56.880
what's the way to put it? Yeah. Yeah. I'm getting inklings of what I was going to mention. Oh,

19:56.880 --> 20:02.560
it's so weird to like juggle many thoughts. If I'll just finish it, wherever I'm going to take

20:02.560 --> 20:08.640
it now, right? But it's like, basically, the fault of techno optimism is this whole idea of you,

20:08.640 --> 20:15.520
you romanticizing the whole idea of changing the way people do things without seeing,

20:15.520 --> 20:20.800
and this was in the CS Lewis quote, right, that you become a prisoner of what is, what becomes

20:20.800 --> 20:29.760
as well. It's like, it kind of goes both ways. And I also had a couple more. So I think, so

20:29.760 --> 20:37.280
social media is a pretty common way in which the common person can easily detect like thoughts,

20:37.280 --> 20:42.160
right? Where in where this is all taking us, it's not a perfect thing by any means. And it might be

20:42.160 --> 20:47.520
even like immoral in many senses, right? And that's the, that's, I think, like a lot of

20:47.520 --> 20:52.240
heights research around social media is like social media is affecting us badly in many ways,

20:52.240 --> 20:59.120
which we never expected. Yeah, it's already a pretty simple. That's a good example, I think.

20:59.120 --> 21:04.000
And also this morning, I read a newsletter by a tech person, so a technologist,

21:04.640 --> 21:10.080
and I saw a few interesting like things on here, which is also like what people can easily perceive

21:11.360 --> 21:16.800
like to be dangerous or risks, right? And firstly, this relates to what Heidegger mentioned,

21:16.800 --> 21:20.480
but what she wrote here, and there's much more simple language as opposed to what Heidegger

21:20.480 --> 21:25.360
would have written, but part of the problem with the lean startup mindset, lean startup

21:25.360 --> 21:30.240
meaning basically kind of the methodology around startups and tech, right? Is that it sees live

21:30.240 --> 21:34.720
and work as an optimization problem. The point is to help people live a good life, not just an

21:34.720 --> 21:39.600
efficient life. The goal is human flourishing, not convenience. The goal is a good future, not a

21:39.600 --> 21:45.920
technically advanced future. And so it's pretty like technologists and kind of everyday people

21:45.920 --> 21:50.720
are perceiving this. And this was written by, sorry, I think I'm not sure you pronounce her name,

21:50.720 --> 21:56.560
but she's a technologist. And I'll put up her. Is it a substack or what is it? Yeah, yeah,

21:56.560 --> 22:00.960
substack. Put up the substack. Yeah. And the second thing she wrote, also kind of in more

22:00.960 --> 22:06.080
simple words, it's like, I've lost a lot of faith in tech solutionism, the idea that most

22:06.080 --> 22:10.400
problems can be solved by technology. Why? Because most problems are people problems,

22:10.400 --> 22:14.960
not technology problems. I don't believe. Very important point. We need to touch on that. That's

22:14.960 --> 22:18.800
a very important point. Yeah, I don't believe we are about to surrender to a robotic new dawn,

22:18.800 --> 22:23.440
where an AI will replace McKinsey or your therapist. Why? Because a company doesn't hire

22:23.440 --> 22:28.080
McKinsey because they're better than the AI. They hire McKinsey because if something goes wrong,

22:28.080 --> 22:34.080
nobody will blame you for hiring McKinsey. Humans are complicated. And so on this level,

22:34.080 --> 22:39.040
you can kind of see as well, like lots of kind of tech solutionism, that's an interesting word,

22:39.040 --> 22:46.560
is this is the point that kind of that most problems are people problems. And even on this

22:46.560 --> 22:57.040
level, right, kind of the applied technological level, there are already gaps. You could say

22:57.040 --> 23:02.240
problems, right? For me, the word I've been using recently, thanks to Tom McGavin,

23:02.240 --> 23:08.160
is contradictions. Human existence is, ontologically, there's like this,

23:08.800 --> 23:15.520
we have built in contradictions that we can't get away with or jettison out of our existence.

23:16.640 --> 23:20.320
Okay, I took down a lot of notes here, we know what you were saying. I want to get back

23:20.320 --> 23:24.320
to the self-worship point, because that is something that I hadn't thought about much.

23:24.320 --> 23:29.600
And because pretty much everything you said, I've kind of thought about written on and obviously

23:29.600 --> 23:35.280
I resonate with. But the self-worship bit isn't something I have, I have, I have thought about.

23:35.280 --> 23:40.160
And the reason I want to talk about that is I realized in my initial long monologue, I kind of

23:40.160 --> 23:45.680
missed a certain point I was going to make, which was that technology is not neutral as we

23:45.680 --> 23:56.560
discussed, but also another misconception tech bros have is they think that all technology will do

23:56.560 --> 24:02.640
is that it'll just amplify who we already are. And that comes with a lot of assumptions and

24:02.640 --> 24:07.600
ideological presuppositions that we already know who we are, that yes, human beings are static and

24:07.600 --> 24:13.120
that we have a specific nature of some kind. And secondly, that technology will just make

24:13.120 --> 24:21.200
kind of better versions of what human beings are. Whereas I would say if a lot of, well,

24:21.200 --> 24:29.600
I would certainly religion, but also philosophy, 20th century philosophy history, and now more

24:29.600 --> 24:38.080
recent sociological and psychological research is showing us that no human beings are malleable,

24:38.080 --> 24:44.800
not in a bad sense, nor in a good sense. We are malleable as such. And therefore, it's a mistake

24:44.800 --> 24:51.680
to assume that the human subject, even at an individual level, can, can just, we can amplify

24:51.680 --> 24:58.400
who we are. That, that, that doesn't happen. Our social environment deeply affects us. But,

24:58.400 --> 25:04.000
but saying all that though, is it because I don't get it, because for me, my whole,

25:04.000 --> 25:08.960
my whole view with technology is we're moving towards a, thanks to capitalism. And I mean

25:08.960 --> 25:14.080
that obviously, sadonically, a post humanist society where human beings simply become agents

25:14.080 --> 25:19.440
of capital, they become technical agents in society. But when you talk about self worship,

25:19.440 --> 25:24.160
that kind of gives it a bit of a different thrust. So perhaps you could expand on that a bit.

25:24.160 --> 25:27.280
Yeah, yeah. But yes, also, so what you're mentioning around

25:27.680 --> 25:34.080
the technology having kind of its own essence, right, that whole thing. I

25:36.720 --> 25:42.880
think, and so most people now they see it as neutral, but that misses the point. It's like,

25:42.880 --> 25:47.920
when, because I think when you say all technology is self augmenting, you kind of assume that it's

25:47.920 --> 25:53.440
neutral, right, like it just augments. But no, it has its own essence, it has its own metaphysics,

25:53.520 --> 25:56.560
as we were discussing, right? Yes, its own reality in some sense, which

25:58.400 --> 26:01.680
yeah, it's a hyper reality as well, as you mentioned. And I think the last thing I read

26:01.680 --> 26:05.840
is from Jack, Jack's, I'm not sure you pronounce his name, but he he's also written quite a bit

26:05.840 --> 26:16.240
of on technology. And he recognized it as a self augmenting force, but one that kind of

26:16.240 --> 26:21.600
engineers the world on its own terms. And so I guess that's the way that's how that's how

26:21.680 --> 26:26.400
Heidegger ends his essay in fact. Heidegger makes the point towards the end of his essay,

26:27.120 --> 26:32.320
that technology has a being of its own, that that does change and augment the world. Yes.

26:32.320 --> 26:36.000
Yeah, because it is self augmenting in its application, right? And so in that sense,

26:36.000 --> 26:40.320
it's like it's neutral because it just augments the human subject. But no, it kind of does it

26:40.320 --> 26:44.320
on its own terms because then you create something, you create a being, almost a mode of being,

26:44.320 --> 26:48.000
right? And that has its own essence, its own metaphysics, that's what we've been repeating.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.720
And I want to give an example on that. I think kissing point would be the stock market.

26:52.720 --> 26:58.000
Majority of the stock market, it's not human beings, the actors in the stock market aren't

26:58.000 --> 27:03.600
human beings anymore. It's virtually robots. It's program machine softwares that are doing

27:04.160 --> 27:10.720
stock trading and whatnot. And yes, you could argue that the capitalist by by workers and by

27:10.720 --> 27:18.320
human beings. But regardless, the stock market now is a system with with its own metaphysics,

27:18.320 --> 27:26.560
with its own reality. And human beings are becoming unnecessary for it. We're becoming

27:28.560 --> 27:33.440
so before before we get into the self worship bit, I think it's important to kind of get into

27:34.480 --> 27:38.080
what we mean really when we think about the essence of metaphysics

27:39.040 --> 27:42.560
of technology, right? Because I think we've said this many times, but it's not I think it's not

27:42.560 --> 27:47.040
we can make it clearer like what that actually means. And so kind of self worship, if I was to

27:47.040 --> 27:52.160
talk about the art, I would kind of think about it more to like towards the end, like self worship

27:52.160 --> 27:56.720
is kind of where we're leading ourselves ourselves to. But even right now, what we're participating

27:56.720 --> 28:05.360
is in like this whole met like this whole hyper reality that we live in is it's got a it's got

28:05.440 --> 28:10.880
its own metaphysics, it's got its own essence. And what that means, right? I think the example

28:10.880 --> 28:18.480
we mentioned earlier was that we start to see people as resources. That's kind of one way to

28:18.480 --> 28:23.120
look at it. Well, okay, to really, really break this down, because I know that you and I tend to

28:23.120 --> 28:30.320
get very abstract without thinking is metaphysics in a very pragmatic way of putting it is it's

28:30.400 --> 28:37.200
simply telling us an art. That means what are we supposed to do? Now, of course, if you go to

28:37.200 --> 28:42.160
Aristotelian metaphysics, you could you could look for the metaphysics or the essence of a tree.

28:42.160 --> 28:46.720
What's a tree? Is there a platonic tree somewhere? Well, let's let's forget about all of that for a

28:46.720 --> 28:52.960
moment. Let's just simply think at a at a social level, metaphysics is an art. So what are we

28:52.960 --> 28:59.200
supposed to do with a without given reality? And connecting that in my view, connecting that to

28:59.200 --> 29:07.040
human resources would be okay, the metaphysical sort of injunction or what they're told to do

29:07.040 --> 29:16.640
is to take these human agents and use them to, I don't know, maximize profit or maximize

29:16.640 --> 29:23.120
productivity, optimize or be more efficient. So that is kind of the metaphysical injunction or

29:23.840 --> 29:28.880
ideological injunction that is metaphysical after all. And that's the kind of the way I view

29:29.760 --> 29:33.680
the the metaphysics of technology, although, although, and I want to kind of put this caveat

29:33.680 --> 29:38.640
here. So because we started off with Heidegger, look, this port isn't on Heidegger, but we started

29:38.640 --> 29:42.240
off with Heidegger. So it doesn't have to be about Heidegger, but for Heidegger, it's not just

29:42.240 --> 29:47.920
that it's also he's looking for an essence of technology and what that entails. But sorry,

29:47.920 --> 29:50.960
did my kind of point about the, you know, that's good. That's good. So it's kind of

29:52.320 --> 29:55.840
and I think there's one more layer to it as well. Like, I think, you know, we see each other's,

29:55.840 --> 29:59.920
we see each other as as capital resources, essentially, and that's a danger to her, obviously,

29:59.920 --> 30:06.560
right? But I think there's one, like, another layer of art as well is I think

30:07.920 --> 30:13.360
we kind of blend on this idea, like this intrinsic idea that we don't talk about that.

30:14.800 --> 30:22.400
If we, if we liberate ourselves from everything, we would be happier. It's that kind of,

30:23.280 --> 30:26.960
like it's just the classic capitalist kind of ideology, right? And that's something very

30:26.960 --> 30:33.360
inherent in technology, right? It's like the thing that causes us unhappiness is like systems

30:33.360 --> 30:39.600
or structures that we have to be liberated from. And that's, that's sometimes true. But I think now

30:39.600 --> 30:44.800
we're getting to the point where we, we're trying to liberate ourselves from reality itself.

30:46.080 --> 30:50.960
Right. And so, but then the thing is that in a far more fundamental way, it's just making

30:50.960 --> 30:56.960
far more people more unhappy, which is, which is, which is a contradiction, almost ironic

30:56.960 --> 31:01.760
contradiction you pointed out before. And you know, you would, you, you in fact hit the nail on

31:01.760 --> 31:07.520
the head because this guy Ray Kurzweil, who is kind of like a futurist, he, I remember reading,

31:07.520 --> 31:11.920
I haven't read any of his books, but he is kind of known as well. He, he perhaps is like before

31:11.920 --> 31:18.640
Balaji and Elon Musk and all these types. He was kind of the OG tech bro. And he was writing about

31:18.640 --> 31:25.600
these things, you know, in like the nineties. And he has this really interesting essay, which I read,

31:25.600 --> 31:34.160
I forget where, but he talks about how you could just live in a simulation and you won't be limited

31:34.160 --> 31:39.280
by your physical reality. So you could live kind of the mind in a back machine. So if you, one day,

31:39.280 --> 31:44.640
if you feel like a woman, you are a woman. And not to go to the whole gender, you know,

31:44.720 --> 31:47.440
debate about that, like forget about it. But no, I think it's true.

31:47.440 --> 31:53.600
Like if you feel like, look, let's say a biological female, right? You just all you got to do is

31:54.480 --> 32:01.040
kind of cognize that in your, in your, in your brain. And then you become that thing. So

32:01.760 --> 32:08.400
we kind of completely let go of our physical embodied reality, which for Heidegger, Maurice

32:08.400 --> 32:15.760
Molleponti or modern Cogsci, a cognitive science would be an, and complete abomination,

32:15.760 --> 32:18.560
given that we are deeply embodied creatures to be human.

32:18.560 --> 32:25.840
Yeah. Well, at the end of the day, we try and liberate ourselves from reality. So precisely,

32:25.840 --> 32:34.800
that's what we're doing. Yes. Because also that Heidegger is kind of metaphysics, right? It's

32:34.880 --> 32:40.480
not just about you, but it's about, it's not just about subject and object. That's kind of

32:40.480 --> 32:44.000
his metaphysics. He breaks it. Yeah. No differentiation there. It's kind of the

32:44.000 --> 32:48.880
subject participating, subject and object are one. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, he has got many,

32:48.880 --> 32:54.160
like he calls it that's man, he calls it life. Well, the idea being that you can't just, yeah,

32:54.160 --> 32:59.920
you can't isolate the subject from their life world as such. Yeah. Yeah. So to put it simply,

33:00.160 --> 33:06.000
it's like kind of man has a certain relation to nature, right? Man has a certain relation to

33:06.000 --> 33:11.440
others, like the other, right? And there's a certain kind of,

33:14.160 --> 33:17.920
without going into what that should look like, I think what technology does is it comes in

33:17.920 --> 33:23.760
and imposes a certain view on that, right? Like, because traditionally, like pre-modernity,

33:24.400 --> 33:30.880
like man so nature as something to be worked with. Correct. Like man so fellow man as like

33:30.880 --> 33:35.920
something to be treasured as friends. In fact, the kind of what technology does,

33:35.920 --> 33:41.680
what the whole technological worldview does, this is, again, talking of discussing its essence,

33:42.800 --> 33:49.280
is firstly, kind of nature is seen as something to be used as a resource, right? Slash is to be

33:50.240 --> 33:56.320
overpowered, right? And overpowered means used, right? It's kind of the same thing. And the danger

33:56.320 --> 34:00.160
is that the same thing is applied to man, right? Like man becomes human resources, as you say,

34:00.160 --> 34:04.960
it's something to be used. And so in that sense, you can kind of see how technology is not neutral,

34:04.960 --> 34:09.600
it imposes a worldview, that's the essence. I mean, also, on your point on pre-modernity,

34:09.600 --> 34:15.040
the Hegelian point there would be in pre-modern society, and obviously I'm not a historian,

34:15.120 --> 34:22.560
but from what I've read, it's not even that we, that individuals, so other individuals as,

34:23.200 --> 34:29.680
as, oh, that's someone that I'm related to. No, no, no, they saw their subjectivity in them. As in,

34:30.400 --> 34:34.640
I am you as much as you are me. Yeah. Oh, no, no. Oh, yeah. No, but I'll give you the

34:34.640 --> 34:39.120
technological spin, right? It's not like, because nowadays, what's the phenomenon we call the social

34:39.120 --> 34:43.280
phenomenon? Everything is kind of networking, right? Yes. Oh my god, dude, you read my mind again.

34:44.240 --> 34:48.480
But like, when you speak to other people, you are like, what's the career gain here?

34:48.480 --> 34:54.560
Correct. I hate the term networking. It's a total term. It's just even something as

34:54.560 --> 34:58.640
intimate as friendship becomes something where I need to get something from that person

34:58.640 --> 35:05.360
for me to rise in the social hierarchy or whatnot. Exactly. So that's the imposition of

35:05.360 --> 35:10.800
technology, right? Sorry, sorry, sorry. I interrupt you. Can you say that, make that point again,

35:10.800 --> 35:14.080
a bit more, like fresher out a bit more, because I feel like you were getting out,

35:14.080 --> 35:20.720
making a really good point and I got excited. So again, clearly, so people get what you're

35:20.720 --> 35:24.720
saying is really, really, it happens between us. But yeah, so technology has an essence, right?

35:24.720 --> 35:28.880
And two clear examples where I can see it playing out. And I think which Heidegger touched on in

35:28.880 --> 35:37.680
book as well is like nature and fellow men, right? So you, we used to see nature as something to

35:37.760 --> 35:43.040
work with. We used to see men and women as friends, right? Friendships would be cultivated.

35:43.760 --> 35:47.840
We kind of saw everything on equal ground. But then when the capitalistic slash technological

35:48.800 --> 35:55.840
ideals, ideas started playing in the picture, then we, that started twisting our worldview, right?

35:55.840 --> 36:02.400
It started twisting our relation to the things around us. And as Heidegger's metaphysics goes,

36:02.400 --> 36:09.440
and which I actually, I personally agree with, like man is not just an individual, right? That

36:09.440 --> 36:14.960
uses things. No, like it's not just a subject and a relation to the object, like being separate in

36:14.960 --> 36:19.200
any way, right? In the subject very much participates in the object in a very,

36:20.880 --> 36:28.240
like you can't, you can't separate them in a very inseparable way. And so when technology comes in

36:28.240 --> 36:35.600
and twists certain views, you know, it's, it affects the human, it affects the mind to an

36:35.600 --> 36:40.480
understated degree. And that's why I think these days, right? It's something that's so heavily

36:40.480 --> 36:44.560
encapsulates everyone's thinking that they kind of not, you're not even conscious of it.

36:45.600 --> 36:49.200
I mean, it changes you. It makes you something human.

36:50.000 --> 36:55.840
Yeah. Yes. Like nowadays, like meeting someone purely for career gains normal,

36:55.920 --> 37:01.440
whereas it wasn't 50 years ago. And that's what technology does to us. And like using nature

37:02.320 --> 37:08.240
is normal to us, right? Yeah. I mean, we can't use it. We can't exploit. We can't exploit. We

37:08.240 --> 37:14.000
commoditize nature. But if you tell that to like an indigenous, you know, someone in, in this,

37:14.000 --> 37:18.400
I don't know, 1400s, 1300s, that would sound absolutely. Even our own Aboriginal people in

37:18.400 --> 37:22.160
Australia, like, I mean, I'm sure, obviously, don't get me wrong. I'm not making, I hate to

37:22.160 --> 37:26.720
make the racist argument or their primitive native one with nature. None of that nonsense.

37:26.720 --> 37:33.840
But if you, if you speak to, let's say, it doesn't have to be, leave aside the Aboriginal people,

37:33.840 --> 37:40.640
because I hate that argument, you know, noble savage, it's very racist. But if you study, if you

37:40.640 --> 37:47.840
do like, listen, anthropological study, anthropological study and explore these communities,

37:48.400 --> 37:55.520
certainly they don't have this concept of exploiting nature or using seeing nature as a resource.

37:55.520 --> 38:03.840
For them, nature was very much alive. And it was, it was a part of them as much as they were part of

38:04.720 --> 38:09.920
it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, precisely. And that's, and that's one of the things, right? Because now the

38:09.920 --> 38:16.080
danger, I think, is the kind of metaphysical problem. Like it's a, it's a kind of a spiritual crisis,

38:16.080 --> 38:22.480
right? As you will call it. That is, we're losing our relation to everything around us, right?

38:22.480 --> 38:26.320
We start to see nature as something to be used. We start to see humans as something to be used.

38:27.280 --> 38:30.880
And there's something that you lose there. There's something that you lose there. And I think

38:30.880 --> 38:34.880
that's where kind of my whole idea around self worship comes in, because that's a position of

38:34.880 --> 38:41.520
pride, right? That's to say that, you know, kind of my imperative here is to have power over

38:41.840 --> 38:47.040
everything. It's to kind of reinvent, like impose a new order and everything.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.600
It becomes a Hobbesian nightmare, you know, it's just.

38:49.600 --> 38:53.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think like, and that's probably the Christian worldview in me

38:53.440 --> 38:58.320
speaking as opposed to the Nietzschean, because the Nietzschean ideals will be like, no, let's reinvent

38:58.320 --> 39:02.880
the way things are done. But I don't think that's possible in many ways. And that's why I kind of

39:02.880 --> 39:10.320
refer to C.S. Lewis, because like in the abolishment of man, abolishment of, abolishment of man.

39:11.280 --> 39:16.640
My favorite Lewis book by myself, right? He basically writes precisely about this subject,

39:16.640 --> 39:21.360
right? Which is like the Nietzschean ideal kind of falls on its own head, because you can't

39:22.480 --> 39:29.520
revalue values using the values, using the values themselves, right? And so there's,

39:29.520 --> 39:33.360
there's a lot to be. I have a slight disagreement there, but we don't have to get to that. I have

39:33.360 --> 39:39.520
a slight philosophical debate there. We can do it another time. But the whole danger there is one

39:39.520 --> 39:44.560
of pride, right? And I think putting aside the Nietzschean idea, which I think there's some problems

39:44.560 --> 39:49.440
there. I think if you look at it from a Christian point of view, it's like pride goes before a fall

39:49.440 --> 39:57.600
to put it more simply. And also to cover a bit of what Lewis prophesied in the abortion of

39:57.600 --> 40:06.080
ban book is if we keep on trying to go down this path of like gaining power over everything,

40:06.080 --> 40:13.120
we gain power over nature, we can use, we can extract everything as resources, we start doing

40:13.120 --> 40:18.640
the same to other people. And eventually we start doing the thing to human nature itself, right?

40:18.640 --> 40:27.200
And there's the whole kind of thing around the whole he prophesies this endpoint to be kind of

40:27.200 --> 40:35.360
the eugenic event, right? The event at which basically man takes on the position of God as a

40:35.360 --> 40:40.640
creator. Yeah, yeah. And you know, connecting that to a bit of what Heidegger is talking about here,

40:40.640 --> 40:46.000
that's sort of what he means by enframing. And the grand irony of all of that was Heidegger was a

40:46.000 --> 40:51.920
big old Nazi. And the Jews were exactly, they were enframed, they were just used things to be

40:53.040 --> 41:01.680
powered to exploit and used upon. And certainly, you know, even the Nazi ideal has an element of

41:01.760 --> 41:08.080
self-worship. But for them, it's more that they worship a system, they worship the organic unity

41:08.080 --> 41:15.840
or the whole of being, which for me is a fascistic idea. So as you were, as you were

41:15.840 --> 41:22.640
expounding on the self-worship, but I was trying to figure out, how can I juxtapose this with kind

41:22.640 --> 41:28.240
of my thesis, which is the post-humanist idea that we are becoming, we're becoming something that is

41:29.200 --> 41:34.800
not human. The future of humanity is going to be without human beings, so to speak.

41:36.880 --> 41:42.320
I'm going to try to make a point here, but you were going to say something. You go first?

41:42.320 --> 41:48.000
Yeah, yeah. I think that's the hyper-reality element to it. Yeah, yeah. So I don't think

41:48.000 --> 41:52.640
Louis saw it from that lens, right? So says Louis specifically saw it from the lens of eugenics. And

41:52.720 --> 41:58.800
I think there's something to that point as well, which is the final stage of man's conquest over

41:58.800 --> 42:08.000
nature is basically when, you know, in the course of reality, when someone, like when one age,

42:08.560 --> 42:14.480
one age really attains, you know, by eugenics, the power to make its descendants as whatever it

42:14.480 --> 42:19.360
pleases. Yeah. I mean, for me now, I would still say that's post-humanist, because the post-humanist

42:19.360 --> 42:25.360
idea is that there's no, there's no human being per se. We're just, again, we're biological entities

42:25.360 --> 42:31.680
and we can be optimized, we're used. And so, and so what Louis points out is that in a way,

42:31.680 --> 42:39.680
all men who live after this age are patients of that power. So then they are weaker, not stronger.

42:39.680 --> 42:43.200
Yeah. So like, no matter what kind of power. That's a supreme irony. Yeah.

42:43.200 --> 42:47.840
The things we put in their hands, it's this people in this age which has preordained how

42:47.840 --> 42:52.400
they are to use them. So in a very interesting way, Louis prophesied this endpoint, this event

42:52.400 --> 42:58.960
at which we are bringing ourselves to this route, which is we, our conquest becomes over human nature

42:58.960 --> 43:05.120
itself. And I think a very vivid image of this is in Huxley's Brave New World, right? This human

43:05.120 --> 43:10.480
nature is the last part of nature to surrender to men, right? And in Brave New World, in Huxley's

43:10.480 --> 43:14.880
Brave New World, there's eugenics, there's like prenatal conditioning, I believe, right? Yeah.

43:15.520 --> 43:20.320
And of course, happiness drop, yeah. Perfected the human species, right?

43:21.280 --> 43:25.360
And there's like a perfect, I don't know, applied psychology, whatever, and man has

43:25.360 --> 43:29.600
perfect control over it. Behaviorism, BF skin and behaviorism, man, it's a monastic, yeah.

43:29.600 --> 43:33.120
Yeah. Yeah. And basically, Louis points out that that's the point at which

43:34.240 --> 43:37.200
man reaches the pinnacle of the power and everyone else is kind of,

43:38.880 --> 43:44.400
you know, a prisoner of that. Yeah. So that's something I find interesting. But the artificial

43:44.400 --> 43:49.920
piece, artificial intelligence is something else. It might be something else or it might not be.

43:49.920 --> 43:53.520
I'm also wondering how we can kind of dive into this. Well, in fact, when I was going to bring

43:53.520 --> 43:59.280
this up to you at the end of the part, but I think we, this whole conversation, we can end on a

43:59.280 --> 44:03.920
positive note. And I'll tell you why. And as you know, I'm very cynical. I don't really end things

44:03.920 --> 44:12.320
on positive notes generally. But this, this topic of technology, there is in the typical

44:12.320 --> 44:18.240
Hegelian move in the failure, there can, there can be something good that comes out of it, I believe.

44:20.560 --> 44:25.920
So firstly, the reason, you know, I was a bit initially a bit confused about the

44:25.920 --> 44:30.960
self-worship point was the way I, the way I view the kind of post-humanist idea is that

44:32.080 --> 44:40.560
human subjects, they, they, they stop viewing themselves as human beings. Whatever this deep

44:40.640 --> 44:45.440
down identity we have as human beings, it's just, it's jenisin. But then I realized, in fact,

44:45.440 --> 44:50.800
no, the self-worship point is perhaps more perspicacious because in post-modern society,

44:50.800 --> 44:57.920
we live in this kind of ruthless pragmatism. So being a self-worshipping, egoistic,

44:57.920 --> 45:04.400
narcissist is one of the best ways to get around post-modern capitalist society if you are a bit

45:04.400 --> 45:10.400
Machiavellian, because then, you know, as we were discussing, if we view other human beings as not

45:10.400 --> 45:17.600
really human, but rather some other biological agents to be used and exploited, then pretty much

45:17.600 --> 45:23.680
the best way is to play the game, play the game and get to the top, whatever the top and, and the,

45:23.680 --> 45:27.680
and the funny thing is in post-modernism, the top doesn't even matter, it's just climb the hierarchy

45:27.760 --> 45:33.920
for the sake of climbing the hierarchy. There, there's no, there's no, there aren't the, let's say

45:33.920 --> 45:40.160
the, the, the, the typical values of, of beauty, love, truth or God, none of that. It's just climb

45:40.160 --> 45:44.960
the hierarchy. We discussed this in the previous pods, isn't it? So, and then in that self-worship

45:44.960 --> 45:50.880
kind of works because it's not self-worship in the sense that you think, I don't know, at least

45:50.880 --> 45:55.280
this is my interpretation of it, but there's something special about me that I'm unique,

45:55.280 --> 46:01.280
I'm divine and none of that, it's just, I am, I am who I am. It doesn't even matter, but what matters

46:01.280 --> 46:07.440
is the, is the game, is the, is the task, it's the, it's the, it's partaking in, in, in the, in the

46:07.440 --> 46:17.920
social game, so to speak. Um, yeah, yeah. Well, I think there are two ways to look at it, right? And

46:17.920 --> 46:21.600
earlier, as I mentioned, like there's kind of a Nietzsche approach, which is to lean into it,

46:22.240 --> 46:26.960
because if you are going to think about, like, because Nietzsche's idea is like,

46:26.960 --> 46:31.040
the Ubermanches, like the Superman, that's the ideal you want to, you want to be, right? You

46:31.040 --> 46:38.800
want to be the person to kind of revalue valuations, right? Yeah. Rebuild and kind of, I mean, you want

46:38.800 --> 46:43.920
to even, you want to rebuild the, the meta values itself, not just values, but reevaluate what values

46:44.000 --> 46:53.520
are itself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so kind of, as we discussed, technology is a major imposition

46:53.520 --> 46:59.040
on like the way things are done and how like worldviews, like, like to do the modern worldviews,

46:59.040 --> 47:03.760
right? If you were to work and build within that space, you kind of have the opportunity to do

47:03.760 --> 47:10.160
something like that, right? Well, I mean, actually, I was like, sorry, like, I guess the

47:10.640 --> 47:18.560
easiest way to say how much of an impact technology is, is if we were to boil down the ages

47:19.600 --> 47:27.360
into one word, like you wouldn't call this current age we're in and, you know, a post-modern age,

47:27.360 --> 47:31.680
like that does some, that's mean something. If you call it an atheistic age, like, yeah,

47:31.680 --> 47:35.280
that's something, I think people usually call you a technological age. Correct. Because I mean,

47:35.280 --> 47:39.760
post-modern age, you could even call it the last century, but our specific age is perhaps

47:39.760 --> 47:45.280
the technological age. So I think you can conclude from that. Say to say, technology has been like

47:45.280 --> 47:50.640
the genre, like the era defining thing, right? And so if you were to pursue the Nietzsche ideal,

47:50.640 --> 47:54.720
you have the opportunity to redefine the way everything starts, right, in that lens. I think,

47:55.280 --> 48:01.040
although on the Christian kind of religious path, I think there's a, there's quite something to the

48:01.040 --> 48:07.520
whole idea of, I think I saw this coin somewhere, but it's like technological acesis, I think, like,

48:08.320 --> 48:13.760
like acicism, like being a technological aesthetic, right? Basically, distancing yourself from

48:13.760 --> 48:21.520
technology and its metaphysics. And the whole imperative there is like, be aware that, you know,

48:21.520 --> 48:26.080
technology in everything, there is a trade-off, right? Like, no technology is perfect,

48:26.080 --> 48:32.400
everything comes at a price, and prices that we're not aware of. And more importantly,

48:32.400 --> 48:37.120
that you can't have your cake and eat it too. Exactly. Because the trade-off argument for

48:37.120 --> 48:40.400
me, that's too pragmatic. Because that kind of makes the assumption that, oh, you can have the

48:40.400 --> 48:44.400
good without the bad. I don't think that's how the reality works. I agree. But I think, firstly,

48:44.400 --> 48:49.760
you'll become aware of it, right? You'll be aware of it. Certainly. The whole imperative there from

48:49.760 --> 48:53.680
the Christian point of view is to kind of keep the means, the means, and keep the ends, the ends,

48:53.680 --> 49:00.400
right? Yes. I actually made a note earlier, but I think Ivan Illich, I think that's his name,

49:00.400 --> 49:05.200
he's also written quite a bit on technology. You may have to send me all these things because

49:05.280 --> 49:10.880
I need to put them in the show. But he argues for what he calls a convivial use of technology.

49:10.880 --> 49:14.480
Sorry, what was that word? Convivial. Right. I don't actually don't know what it means.

49:16.320 --> 49:22.000
That's what he called it. But what that entails basically is firstly, technology

49:22.800 --> 49:28.880
exists to fulfill man's existing needs and desires, instead of generating new needs and desires.

49:29.600 --> 49:35.920
And so, technology, capitalism, you can kind of, that's when you place the means as means and

49:35.920 --> 49:40.160
ends as ends, I think. The other point is quite simple. Increases man's freedom,

49:40.160 --> 49:46.400
independence, enhances welfare, physical man. Okay, okay. Now here's where my cynical side is

49:46.400 --> 49:53.040
coming out. As a Zhezhekian lecanian, I don't know if that's possible. This is the way I become

49:53.040 --> 50:00.720
very cynical. I don't know if it's possible for us to purely use technology as something that,

50:01.440 --> 50:07.840
as a tool, which is how most of us think it was used. As a pure tool that fulfills our desires.

50:07.840 --> 50:13.200
Because firstly, I don't think human desire can ever be fulfilled. We are desiring beings. And

50:13.200 --> 50:20.720
for me here, lecan is, he is a prophet, he gets it, he gets it precisely. Which again,

50:20.720 --> 50:27.600
is the problem. Which the problem is that our desires are unfulfillable. Therefore, the technological

50:27.600 --> 50:33.360
metaphysics or whatever you may call it, can exploit those desires. And for me though, for me

50:33.360 --> 50:40.320
though, I don't know, as far as I can say, my only way to approach this is to take on that

50:40.320 --> 50:48.160
contradiction. It's not to, it's not to try and take the good without the bad. Because that,

50:48.240 --> 50:53.200
as C.S. Loews points out, would make things worse, is to take on the contradiction. And of

50:53.200 --> 50:57.360
course, that doesn't mean succumbing and giving into the bad. I'm not saying, oh, go and become a

50:57.360 --> 51:02.960
porn addict in, I don't know, Mark Zuckerberg's meta word and just like that. I don't mean that.

51:02.960 --> 51:08.960
I mean, as you said, first be aware of it. And then the only solution I see is through critique,

51:08.960 --> 51:16.240
through perpetual critique, through working through the contradictions and doing all these

51:16.240 --> 51:20.000
things which some people who are a bit more intellectual might find silly. Things like,

51:20.000 --> 51:25.680
you know, social media detoxes, digital minimalism. Those are good things. We should not sneer at them

51:25.680 --> 51:30.960
and kind of look down upon them. Because that's the, again, that's our life world. We can't,

51:32.160 --> 51:36.880
don't play the Buddhist game or the quasi-Buddhist game where you, oh, everything's a cosmic

51:36.880 --> 51:42.000
phenomenon. Detach us. No, no, no. For me, it's partaking the contradictions and work through them.

51:42.240 --> 51:44.960
Which is hard, which is difficult work.

51:44.960 --> 51:48.800
Right. You know, that's a good point. But also, yeah, I guess from a psycho and analytical

51:48.800 --> 51:52.960
point of view, it's like desire is everything. Yeah. Desire is fundamental because we are

51:52.960 --> 52:00.240
lacking beings. That's an interesting one. But I think very much there are kind of different

52:00.240 --> 52:06.560
levels to it. And where my mind goes with that is like to go back to kind of the whole essence

52:06.560 --> 52:14.080
of technology, right? I think one of the major, like one, I'd say even it's, it's driving force

52:14.880 --> 52:20.560
is that within technology itself, it's essence. It's not just that you're engineering tools,

52:20.560 --> 52:27.440
but you're engineering desires. Certainly. Because it reveals. It reveals. Yeah, you're kind of,

52:27.440 --> 52:32.560
and it's, that's a very deliberate thing, right? And that's the whole, that's the whole concept of,

52:32.560 --> 52:41.520
that's not concept. The whole driving force of capitalism and social engineering or propaganda,

52:41.520 --> 52:47.760
right? I mean, I mean, social engineering, ideology, it's also kind of how like people

52:47.760 --> 52:51.680
like Balaji, they talk about the network state where in the network state, we can create it,

52:51.680 --> 52:56.400
where it's not top down planning, but it's bottom up planning. But nonetheless, there still is an

52:56.400 --> 53:01.360
ideology that tells people what to do, which, which communities. But it's like, that's, like,

53:01.360 --> 53:08.000
that's, that's technology. Oh, yeah, certainly. Yeah, he, I mean, he is like technology. It's

53:08.000 --> 53:12.240
like that to me, that is technology. And you know something interesting as, as, I mean, I'm kind

53:12.240 --> 53:16.480
of braver, you know, your, your, your line of thought that I'm sorry for like interrupting

53:17.360 --> 53:22.080
or breaking a lot of thought. So Techne, here's where I really like Heidegger because he placed

53:22.560 --> 53:29.920
his, he's brilliant. Like he's his knowledge on language is unbelievable. Techne in ancient Greek

53:29.920 --> 53:36.320
was also used for art. So art was referred to as Techne and art is perhaps one of the,

53:37.040 --> 53:42.560
you know, perhaps the typical example of something that reveals, right? Art reveals to it. It reveals

53:42.560 --> 53:47.840
new realities, reveals truths. So what's really interesting is that word Techne that was used

53:47.840 --> 53:54.720
for art historically, especially in ancient Greece, is now used for, for technical tools,

53:54.720 --> 54:00.560
for technology. And I don't, I don't know what to make of it, but Heidegger thinks, oh, what,

54:00.560 --> 54:03.760
he's like, okay, why is that? Just got a question why that is. That's really,

54:03.760 --> 54:08.400
Yeah, no, that's just a really good point. But then, yeah, though it becomes clear, right? It's

54:08.400 --> 54:15.040
like, kind of propaganda is, is not part of it. It's like propaganda is almost like,

54:15.840 --> 54:19.520
breathing air. It's like the breathing air for technology itself, right? Yeah, it's not like

54:19.520 --> 54:25.040
a byproduct. No, no, no, it is it. It is the ideology is it? Yeah. Yeah. There's, there's

54:25.040 --> 54:29.920
obviously this very interesting layer as well, where to the whole worldview or essence of technology,

54:29.920 --> 54:34.800
where it's like, engineer, the engineering of desires. And obviously that's kind of

54:36.080 --> 54:41.840
its own, like we can run a whole separate discussion on. Well, yeah, I mean, one thing I

54:41.840 --> 54:45.440
want to do, in fact, one thing I want to do is, because I know we're going to do some book

54:45.440 --> 54:50.640
discussions in the future is to discuss, because I think, you know, this book here by Todd MacGowden,

54:52.080 --> 54:54.960
capitalism and desire, you know, I've spoken about this a couple of times.

54:56.960 --> 55:01.840
I mean, this, this book could easily be technology and desire and the message of the book would

55:01.840 --> 55:08.960
still stand. If we could just, because they did the two things go hand in hand that tightly

55:08.960 --> 55:16.320
related. Yeah, well, is there any insights from that book that relate to what? Well, I mean,

55:16.320 --> 55:22.800
it's the idea of, the idea of desire is metanomic that it desire, desires for the sake of desiring.

55:23.440 --> 55:27.520
And, and then the idea of object, we don't desire something that exists, it's a virtual

55:27.520 --> 55:32.400
category. And then he connects that to our capitalism functions. But like, I haven't,

55:32.560 --> 55:38.880
I need to like prepare properly if I'm gonna do like, I might do a pod that kind of it's on the book.

55:40.640 --> 55:44.960
Yeah, well, because I guess like the, you know, the accompanying idea there is like,

55:44.960 --> 55:50.880
it's ruling by desires, right? Like it's, it's to bring back the brave new world, right? Like,

55:50.880 --> 55:58.880
because what that contrast is, in a few centuries ago, Orwell wrote 1984. And that was basically

55:58.880 --> 56:06.400
the ruling of a nation, whatever you call it, the ruling of people via control and power, right?

56:06.400 --> 56:13.360
Totalitarian top down, basically. But then Huxley, I think Huxley wrote Brave New World before,

56:14.320 --> 56:18.160
Orwell actually wrote 1984. Oh, is that right? I think Huxley, I think Huxley was right.

56:20.880 --> 56:24.880
Huxley was actually Orwell's lecturer, I think I got the order right. And the very

56:24.880 --> 56:28.320
interesting thing is they had some correspondence between each other, where basically Huxley

56:28.320 --> 56:35.440
disagreed with Orwell. So it was like great writing and whatnot. But he thinks that, you know,

56:35.440 --> 56:42.960
at some point, the totalitarians of the 1984 idea will realize that it's a lot more efficient to

56:42.960 --> 56:52.720
control people by means of desire alone, right? I mean, we live more in and Huxley in reality than

56:52.880 --> 56:57.680
Orwellian. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's like, it's power by giving us what we want, basically.

56:58.960 --> 57:05.520
Or by creating false needs. But giving us what we want, just enough. And that's the point

57:05.520 --> 57:10.480
Tottenham government makes. Capitalism works in the contradiction of it works by not working.

57:11.120 --> 57:18.720
It gives us just enough. Yeah, even like, I think probably like Stalin and Mao even would be impressed.

57:19.440 --> 57:25.680
Yeah. So much control can be. Yeah, yeah. I mean, what's interesting is, you know,

57:25.680 --> 57:28.960
Rijek talks about having a Soviet Union. They always

57:29.680 --> 57:35.280
allowed people a certain level of freedom. They always gave people so you could make jokes

57:35.920 --> 57:41.680
against the state against the party. There was a certain level of, you know, kind of

57:41.680 --> 57:48.880
unsaid humor and that that allowed people to that that this that's exactly how control works.

57:49.440 --> 57:54.480
It's not this kind of the way Orwell imagine. I think personally, Orwell is a bit overrated.

57:54.480 --> 58:01.280
This kind of where it's just tight. You can't say anything. You can't can't utter a word. It's

58:01.280 --> 58:05.840
complete censorship. No, no. It's like, it's kind of like teasing us with a bit of freedom.

58:05.840 --> 58:11.200
We're kept in control, which is why I think we live more in a Huxley in reality than

58:11.600 --> 58:18.000
or within reality. Hey, look, I don't know. Pretty much what I've kind of wanted to discuss,

58:18.000 --> 58:23.280
I think I've made the points, although I did say that I have, I'm a bit optimistic about all of

58:23.280 --> 58:28.720
this, right, regardless of my cynicism. So shall we shall we get there? Or are there any more points

58:28.720 --> 58:33.280
you want to make? Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, we can talk about optimism, because I think

58:33.760 --> 58:43.120
even though that's the kind of ruling the ideology, happiness ideology, technology is going to save

58:43.120 --> 58:48.000
the world, you know, but what Dostoevsky wrote, beauty will save the world. I think the modern

58:48.000 --> 58:55.520
consensus is something more like technology, which obviously for me, I side with beauty over

58:55.520 --> 59:01.280
technology. But okay, my okay, I don't even know if this is optimistic. All I'm saying is this,

59:01.920 --> 59:08.160
the way I view in the failure, there'll be something good that comes out of it is, in fact,

59:08.160 --> 59:14.000
this is interestingly, the part I did with Dr. Grace Tapie, the Lacanian psychoanalyst,

59:15.040 --> 59:18.960
she kind of put this thought in my head. But before that, I've also been thinking about this a bit.

59:19.760 --> 59:27.680
I think given the fact that technology is doing what it's doing to us, it's kind of

59:28.640 --> 59:33.680
taking us towards this hyper-reality or post-humans' reality, people are starting to have these kinds

59:33.680 --> 59:38.720
of conversations. And I know this is like a very cliche thing to say, but people are starting to

59:38.720 --> 59:45.680
question what is the human subject. People are delving more into metaphysics and philosophy.

59:45.680 --> 59:54.000
And if you think about it, Stephen Hawking, he said that philosophy is dead. For me, now philosophy

59:54.400 --> 59:57.680
is revuifying, because first of all, we are seeing the drawbacks in science

59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.200
with quantum theory or the interpretation. Artificial intelligence, people are questioning.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:08.080
And AI is, for me, the ultimate, the epitome of where it concludes, where with AI now is where

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:14.480
philosophy, religion, or certainly religion, philosophy, religion, and religion not at this

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:21.120
kind of fundamentalist naive, but the platonic, neoplatonic, that sense of religion,

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.720
or mysticism, whatnot. Because we're starting to ask questions about what is the human subject,

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:32.720
what's our relationship to reality, what is reality as such. And therefore, that's why,

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:44.080
you know, I believe with the failures of our society, it creates way for potential successes,

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:51.200
but not, again, not successes or not good in the techno-optimist sense, where it's going to

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.560
move towards some kind of synthesis and everything's going to work out. No, no.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.480
The best way to approach this is to take the contradictions on and critique them and work

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.360
through them individually, do the hard work. It's certainly true, because we're critiquing

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.080
technology while using technology. Yeah, I mean, look at, this is the ultimate irony, right? This

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.800
is the ultimate irony, isn't it? Yeah. And, you know, we'll go one step further. You and I both

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:21.360
are tech bros. We work in tech. You work for a Web3 accelerator, which is the full

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:27.520
front of technology. I'm a software engineer. So this is the example of that.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:35.520
Yeah, no, but we're actually full on tech bros. Yeah, I mean, the problem with tech bros is,

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:40.480
I would say tech bro-ism. It's, again, it's the ideology. And it's, again, it's not that you

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:47.520
can step outside of ideology, but the problem is this kind of, yeah. Yeah, look, I'm going to say

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:54.400
despite this is going to sound very arrogant, but naive and rather an infantile way of viewing

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.240
technology without any depth. And again, the point I made before, Heidegger wasn't a Luddite.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:05.040
He was full of science and technology. He makes the point, in fact, to his end of the essay that,

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:11.120
but we need to start asking these questions about what is technology and what's, what's

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:16.560
its relationship to us as human subjects. And then again, what are human subjects? And I think AI

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:23.760
is allowing us to really have those conversations, which is why AI is an interdisciplinary field,

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.160
you know? So for me, that's kind of where the bit of the optimism comes in, although I'm very

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:34.400
careful when it comes to optimism, because again, it's the prevalent ideology of our day. So I'd

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.760
rather be cynical and pessimistic. I think you're right. And that's, yeah, that's a very important

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:43.040
thing to make clear, right? It's like Heidegger wasn't against technology, right? It's like,

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.200
Heidegger, I think you could say Heidegger was against the mode of being that kind of

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:52.800
encompassed technology, like kind of, let's be aware of that. But it's, what Heidegger is not

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.200
saying is like, do away with technology, become an aesthetic, right? And just, yeah, although he

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.520
kind of was like an aesthetic, he lived in a heart most of his life. Oh, right. I didn't know that.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:07.680
Yeah, look, he's a Nazi weird guy. Honestly, Heidegger personally wouldn't want to be him,

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.560
but take his take his philosophy, you know, yeah, but yeah, obviously, I think there is

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:18.240
reason to be optimistic, right? Like as you say, and even from our like, what we're doing now,

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.240
this is enabled by technology, right? Like the fact that I can have this conversation,

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:27.440
like remotely, and that we can put it up and we can, like it's scalable, right? Like people can

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.400
watch it from wherever they want. And whenever, right, that's something, right? That's not

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.040
something that we could do. We talk a lot, we might, we might romanticize pre-modernity and like

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.640
this and that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I romanticize certain parts of it, but if you ask from me,

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.960
what's the best time to be alive? It's now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree, I agree. And so like right

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.120
now we're a lot more technologically able, like enable than we were before. We have like

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.440
extract, we have machines everywhere we look, right? We can do a lot more than we once did.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:04.160
And that gives a lot of like power in terms of ideas such as this, right? Like it means that we

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:09.680
can discuss ideas such as this and like have much more reach and other people can discuss ideas like

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:15.600
this and have much more reach. And so like that's the reason to be optimistic within the information

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.080
age, I suppose. Okay, you and I think you misunderstood me there. My point wasn't even the

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:25.440
functionalist pragmatic point. That is true, that I agree with you certainly. But mine was more,

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:31.840
I was still working on the level of the metaphysics of technology. So given we're doing this

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:38.320
metaphysical analysis and we've, technologies reveal these things to us about being as such,

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:46.880
what I'm saying is, because technology does that, that allows us to, okay, I'll put it this way.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:53.040
Let's say all of these tools, modern technology, whatever, the zoom, all these things weren't

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.520
there, they didn't exist. But technology, the metaphysics of technology was still there.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:04.320
That's a bad view of putting it. What I'm trying to say is it's not the, I'm not trying to make

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:09.920
and it's not the instances or it's not this mic or zoom or the internet or what not. What I'm

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:19.600
saying is what, what technology reveals metaphysically, that itself allows us to have a conversation

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.560
about what the human subject is. If you could say it's kind of like, like Christianity technology

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:32.320
allows itself to be questioned and doubted. Yes, yes. In fact, yes, the Nietzschean point about

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:37.520
Christianity. Yeah. Yeah. So that's kind of the point I'm trying to make. I mean, of course,

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:43.440
these things are great, but by what technology reveals, we start having these questions on being

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:51.600
as such ontologically, ontological questions. But not man. Yeah. And that's, I think I kind of

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.520
exhausted everything I had to say. Anything else you want to add? I think I got the main points too.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:03.920
But like, I always find it interesting, like even a line of thought that my mind's heading to right

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:10.640
now is, you know, even though we're so much more technologically enable now, we can do a lot more.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:17.040
We've got power. It's all, you know, an interesting questionable sort of power, right? Perhaps it's

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:23.680
a good way to kind of conclude. And I think there's a certain element. There's a certain element to

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:30.640
human existence that's, I haven't quite figured this out, but it's the element of purity, right?

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:36.080
Like with, with the purity of being human, the purity of engaging with nature, there's a purity

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:41.200
of engaging with fellow humans, and somehow technology defiles that. And if we already discussed,

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:48.960
we've already discussed how that looks like, right? But I do wonder if there's a kind of, you know,

01:06:49.040 --> 01:07:01.120
ideal state between, an ideal relation between man, nature, and, you know, other people in which

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.040
technology can be a part of the picture. That's probably a crucial, one of the crucial questions

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:10.560
that we have to ask, right, these days. But not one, it's not one that I have, you know, a proper

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.880
answer to. It's like, there are many different ways to approach it. And it's kind of like, I don't

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.960
know, do you want to lean into it? You know, do you want to become a techno futurist and like

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.480
reinvent how everyone does things? There's something there. Do you want to become, you know,

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.600
a primitive, you know, like, like, go and retreat into nature and like, you know, like,

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:34.320
like, yeah, like, yeah, like, there's also something there. So, yeah, they are not

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.960
co-primitivists. I'm not a fan of that. Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess we both want to conclude

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.800

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:50.560

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:57.280
say. Yes. And make it a truth that shakes you, because the Kierkegaardian truths are always

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:00.400
the kind of truths that uproot you. And that's important.
