0	2800	Jacob Bell is a philosopher and writer.
2800	5640	He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy
5640	7920	from the American Public University
7920	11120	and is doing his masters of research in philosophy
11120	14500	at the University of Wales, Trinity St. David.
15400	17400	The working title for his dissertation
17400	19840	is a Phenomenological Analysis
19840	22520	of the Structures of Meaningfulness.
22520	25120	Jacob's primary academic interests
25120	28800	include phenomenology and existentialism.
28800	31480	So Jacob, that's like the formal definition
31480	34040	or the formal bio, let's say.
34040	37080	Would you want to give an introduction yourself, Mayne?
39440	42040	I'll give a less technical introduction and say,
43720	46480	I like thinking about weird things
46480	49440	and philosophy is the perfect discipline
49440	50920	that'll have me to do that.
52120	54880	But yeah, no, I don't have anything else to add.
55880	58920	A Bachelor of Weird Things, that sounds good.
58920	61840	Sounds very much like what we're all interested in, isn't it?
61840	63000	Yeah.
63000	65040	Yeah, so let's jump into it.
65040	68400	For starters, maybe let's get some definitions out of the way
68400	70680	to lay some groundwork.
70680	75320	So within your fields of interest,
75320	80080	some, let's say, terms would be philosophy of mind,
80080	83040	phenomenology and existentialism.
83160	87560	So maybe you could give us a bit of a elucidation
87560	91760	on what those terms are, how they interconnect
91760	94320	and correlate, but also how they are a part
94320	97960	of a broader philosophical framework or a school of thought.
99840	103760	Yeah, so philosophy of mind,
103760	107880	I guess I understand that as a branch of philosophy
107880	111640	that kind of investigates things like mind and consciousness,
111640	113600	which, I mean, to be honest, is a really bad way
113600	116600	of defining the topic, because you don't get any further
116600	119640	than the phrase itself.
119640	122200	So I guess to go into it a little bit further.
124040	128480	If anybody is familiar with philosophy,
128480	130360	they've probably heard of things like physicalism
130360	132120	and idealism and dualism.
132120	136760	Those are like some, I mean, those are metaphysical theories,
136760	139400	but they're prevalent and they're always being discussed
139400	140800	in philosophy of mind.
140840	145360	So you might find people in philosophy of mind working
145360	149560	on trying to discern whether the mind is a physical thing
149560	152960	or if it's a separate substance
154400	156760	or if maybe it's fundamental,
156760	160000	like maybe a panpsychist sort of take on it.
160000	162520	So those are like some of the more popular topics
162520	165560	that philosophers of mind are working in,
165560	170560	I guess, something maybe a little more specific than that.
171040	174200	You get to think about idea of the perception.
175480	178160	What is what I'm perceiving the real world?
178160	179960	There's a representation that kind of plays
179960	184000	into philosophy of mind and metaphysics more broadly,
184000	185960	which then feeds into ideas like,
187160	190240	is the world a mental construct or is it independent of us
190240	193800	and then you start to get into topics of realism.
193800	196840	And so it all kind of feeds back into each other,
197840	201560	but I think as far as contemporary philosophy goes
202560	204280	or philosophy of mind goes,
204280	205640	really what you're seeing,
205640	207680	or at least what I see 90% of the time
207680	212680	are people trying to struggle with where to place consciousness
213960	217040	as far as in a physical world, in a mental world,
217040	219880	in a dualistic world or as something fundamental.
221080	226080	So one thing I've learned recently being a neophyte
226200	230760	is that it seems that all the concepts of ideas
230760	233600	and philosophy, it never is arbitrary.
233600	236960	It doesn't just come sort of deos,
236960	239160	ex machina, I don't know where.
239160	242800	It does have an history.
242800	245880	And where would you sort of, again,
245880	248440	I propose philosophy of mind,
248440	251440	where would you, is there a starting point
251440	254720	where at one point in the history of human,
254760	257120	let's say, human knowledge,
257120	259320	people start getting interested in this topic,
259320	263240	or has it in some sense been the ultimate question,
263240	266600	time immemorial ever since the dawn of consciousness,
266600	267440	let's say?
270480	272480	Which question specifically you're referring to?
272480	274800	Let's talk about philosophy of mind for now.
276400	278320	Yeah, I mean, I think I came,
278320	281520	I don't know if you say I was gonna,
281520	283080	I wanna say pre-socratics,
283080	286120	but I think maybe shortly after the pre-socratics
286120	286960	with Plato,
288560	290160	because with the pre-socratics,
290160	293000	you see some pretty heavy metaphysical stuff going on,
293000	296840	but it's mostly like, is the world made up,
296840	300720	I mean, democratists with the very early atomic theory,
300720	303320	is everything Adam's been avoiding moving around,
303320	308120	or is everything water, is everything fire?
308120	311640	So you have this idea of like monism in the pre-socratics.
312080	314160	Sorry, maybe because that's the top,
314160	316160	that term is quite a loaded term.
316160	319320	So monism is the idea that,
319320	320560	well, actually I'll let you explain,
320560	323760	Jacob, please, if you could explain what monism is.
323760	328760	Tom, so the term just signifies the idea that everything is
328760	331360	one or everything's made out of one particular type.
331360	332840	There's no duality.
332840	335920	Yeah, and I guess that's just one way of putting it to you,
335920	338120	because I mean, I'm saying things are made out of one type
338120	340520	of stuff, so I'm kind of implying that we're talking
340520	342760	about substance-based,
342760	344600	philosophy, substance-based metaphysics,
344600	346960	where like the pre-socratics talking
346960	348880	about different types of material
348880	350520	that things might be made of.
353280	355360	And then, yeah, I guess that kind of leads
355360	357720	into a little bit of philosophy of mind
357720	359800	when you get to Plato and talking about the ideas
359800	362920	and talking about theory of forms and stuff like that.
365480	368400	And so, yeah, I guess philosophy of mind really came
368400	370720	about around the time of Plato.
370720	373840	I mean, I'm not a great historian of science,
373840	376840	so somebody might be able to correct me on that, but...
376840	378360	Oh, better than me, mate, better than me.
378360	381360	So that's something I've always wondered
381360	384520	where initially the idea came from,
384520	388720	or was it more like the Aristotelian way
388720	392040	where people instead of focusing on philosophy of mind,
393000	396400	humanity or human beings were more focused on
396400	397920	let's say the physical world,
397920	399440	the way a scientist would be.
399440	401840	How do things move, causality?
401840	404160	But I'm coming to realize, perhaps,
404160	405400	that it was the other way around,
405400	407840	even before people were interested in the physical world,
407840	412000	it was more on the world of mental constructs,
412000	414520	even things like ethics or metaphysics.
414520	418000	And it's, maybe we could get into, you know,
418000	420240	fewer, fewer writings that shift
420240	423240	where now it seems people are more physicalists
423240	425800	over, let's say, idealists
425800	427800	and why that change has taken place.
427800	431720	And then in your paper, where you talk about meaning,
431720	433880	sort of the ontology of meaning, one of your papers,
433880	436240	you kind of discuss what the, let's say,
436240	438760	the social consequences of that could be.
438760	441680	But anyway, I don't want to get too carried away.
441680	444280	Okay, now we get to the interesting stuff,
444280	446320	whether the fields that you're interested in,
446320	448800	and this is what really drew me to your work,
450080	452560	that's phenomenology and existentialism,
452560	455600	or the way you put it, weird stuff.
455600	459320	So could you please explain in the field of weird stuff,
459320	462440	what that is, what those two terms mean?
462440	466320	And I guess, look, anyone could Google
466320	468280	what phenomenology or existentialism is,
468280	473280	but maybe personal to you, how do you give it?
473880	478600	And maybe juxtapose it with some other schools of thought
478600	483040	in philosophy and science to explain it, please.
483040	486400	Sure, before I do dive into phenomenology,
486400	488920	I just want to place one little caveat
488920	492080	on what I was just saying with regards to philosophy in mind,
492080	494000	and saying that I was generally speaking
494000	495400	of Western philosophy.
496800	498840	I mean, if we start to look at Eastern philosophy,
498840	501120	I mean, we're going to be able to look back,
501120	504080	way before the pre-sacratic into philosophies
504080	506800	and different things like that to get certain ideas of,
506800	509120	I mean, they had some ideas of idealism
509120	511400	before I think any Westerners really did.
511400	515240	So we could look back in history much further
515240	518040	if we were looking to the East as well.
518040	519680	So I just wanted to make that point.
519680	524680	So I didn't seem ignorant to the other side of things there.
525520	527520	Of course, and I point well taken, point well taken.
527520	531760	Yeah, in fact, maybe now I need to kind of change
531760	536760	what I said before or add on to it,
537000	541320	because certainly in a lot of Eastern philosophy,
541320	545000	consciousness in the mind, let's say, was a big part of,
545000	547840	well, more than philosophical practices,
547840	549680	more like spiritual practices, isn't it?
549680	553400	But now we get to the, this is probably semantics,
553400	555920	like how do we discern spirituality and philosophy?
555920	558040	What's the difference?
558040	560800	But that perhaps the whole other conversation.
561640	562680	Yeah, yeah.
562680	565360	Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
565360	566920	I was going to say that'd be a big conversation
566920	568280	just in itself.
568280	569120	No, man.
569240	572760	I'm hoping to, in fact, speak to John Mavaki
572760	574440	because he seems like the perfect person
574440	577880	to discuss those nuances and subtleties
577880	579920	between all these terms.
580880	582120	Yeah, but saying that.
582120	585480	So yeah, sorry, existentialism and phenomenology.
587000	590880	So phenomenology, I'll give a very brief,
590880	595040	I guess like formal description of it.
595040	597080	I guess just trying to place it in history a little bit
597080	598320	because it's a relatively, I mean,
598440	600480	when we're talking about philosophy,
600480	601920	it's relatively new.
601920	606600	I mean, early 1900s, late 1800s is when Husserl,
606600	610160	Edmund Husserl was working on publishing
610160	613600	the first formal definition, the descriptions
613600	616280	of what he took phenomenology to be.
616280	620200	So he's considered the founder of phenomenology formally.
620200	621960	Anyway, you can find threads of it
621960	624440	throughout the history of philosophy.
625280	630040	But yeah, so he published in The Logical Investigations
630040	632560	and then I think like then 12 years later in Ideas,
633520	637520	kind of like almost like I got some guidelines
637520	640160	as to what phenomenology is or should be.
640160	644320	And very basically, it's the study of experience
644320	648680	as experience and that doesn't say up a lot,
649760	654400	but it's really about taking your first person perspective
655400	659560	and kind of applying some rigorous analysis
659560	662720	to your experience and trying to figure out
662720	666880	what certain things mean, trying to make sense of things
666880	670880	as you experience them, as opposed to kind of standing
670880	675880	outside of your experience or trying to put the experience
676280	680120	aside to get a more objective view of the world.
680960	685960	So it stands in direct contrast with things like empirical
687800	688640	science.
688640	691040	I mean, you're not going to find an awful lot
691040	693760	of phenomenology there, except in neuroscience.
693760	695040	And we can talk about that later.
695040	697240	I actually made a note because I want to talk about that
697240	698080	a little bit.
699880	704320	Because of phenomenology, we're taking into consideration
704320	708160	our feelings and our moods and our personal values
708200	713200	and things like that as ways of understanding the world,
714720	719120	you could say, whereas as guides to understanding the world.
719120	723000	I mean, just for example, if we're talking about meaning,
723000	725480	which I'm sure we will get around to it later,
725480	729200	but I'll just make a comment here about it.
729200	731760	I mean, if we're talking about meaning in life,
733440	736480	if you take an objective, try to take a scientific
736480	738760	objective approach to that, you're not really going to be
738760	741640	able to say what's meaningful to you because you're going
741640	746640	to be kind of prevented from considering your interests
746800	749640	and your values and some of the things that you're passionate
749640	752560	about, the things that you're interested in in life,
752560	754160	the way you feel about things.
754160	758360	And if you take all of that out of consideration,
758360	761160	I don't know how you would calculate a meaning in life.
761160	762280	Yeah, of course.
767000	771480	So maybe one example I enjoy, I read somewhere,
771480	775360	is to kind of maybe use like an analogy.
775360	778160	It probably, I probably wouldn't even call this an analogy
778160	781120	because it's, in fact, what a phenomenologist would do.
781120	784480	So as a phenomenologist, if I give you a,
784480	787600	and I'm sorry to kind of put you on the spot here,
787600	791480	but as a phenomenologist, if I give you a cup of coffee,
791480	793720	what would you do?
793720	798040	If you're told, let's say by Husserl himself,
798040	802640	a guy comes back from the dead, from Resorex
802640	806400	and tells you that, study this cup of coffee
806400	810440	as a phenomenologist, how would you do that?
810440	811840	What would your process be?
813320	817080	Well, so I guess it depends on whose phenomenology we're using.
817080	818880	So after Husserl-
818880	820360	Spoken like a true philosopher.
821360	825480	After Husserl, you know, kind of formally came out
825480	828200	with the idea and it started getting,
829280	830840	I mean, he got a lot of interest right away.
830840	832240	I mean, it was a really,
832240	836000	it's for such a new and kind of
838120	841600	divergent approach to doing philosophy.
841600	843200	It gained a lot of interest really quickly,
843200	846480	but pretty much everybody who took over the approach
846480	848320	took it over in their own way.
848360	849960	And I don't think we could really say
849960	853400	that anybody had the same sort of phenomenological method.
853400	856560	I mean, Husserl had very specific techniques
856560	858280	that he wanted that he thought we should apply
858280	860960	while we're doing phenomenology, like the echocache,
860960	863080	which is just to like suspend or bracket
863080	865720	what he calls the natural attitude.
865720	868120	And that's just to say like the kind of habitual way
868120	871800	in which we interpret our experience.
871800	873960	He said, you know, let's just like put those aside.
873960	876120	Let's ignore that sort of stuff
876120	878760	and try to just pay attention to the experience
878760	881520	as we're experiencing it and describe it as such.
883760	888400	Now, you get it, right out following that,
888400	892120	you get Meryl Lopanti, a French phenomenologist,
892120	893720	saying, you know, in his practice,
893720	895280	the phenomenology of perception.
896320	897560	One of the most important things we learned
897560	901320	about the phenomenological reduction
902000	904200	who Husserl described it is that
905640	907600	a full reduction is impossible
907600	908800	because we can never get rid of
908800	910200	all of our interpretive strategies.
910200	911800	If we did, we wouldn't be able to make sense
911800	913640	or describe our experience at all.
915800	919160	And he's not the only one that kind of criticized that.
919160	922960	I mean, Heidegger did to a much greater degree.
922960	926280	Heidegger has a very specific concept of phenomenology,
927640	930560	not necessarily what you think phenomenology should study,
930600	932360	but kind of the approach.
932360	935960	He thinks that the approach should be a specific way.
935960	940960	Like we're looking to derive specific truths
941040	944000	about the world and the phenomenon in the world
944000	945600	when we're using phenomenology.
945600	947560	And so he's there, everybody, I mean,
947560	949520	I guess all the phenomenologists are limiting
949520	953480	in their views on what phenomenology should do.
953480	957120	But I do wanna say something about the way
957120	959560	in which Heidegger defines phenomenology
959560	963920	because I think it's a very brilliant description of it.
965720	970720	And so Heidegger, when he's describing phenomenology
972120	975720	and being in time, but also in the lecture course,
975720	978360	given a few years before he's published being in time,
978360	979320	and that lecture course is called
979320	980960	the History of the Concept of Time.
982600	983920	Sorry, just to clarify.
983920	986480	So being in time is Heidegger's Macdemopus, right?
986480	988880	We should probably put that out.
989520	992040	Sorry, I didn't interrupt you, Jacob, keep going, yeah.
992040	993640	No, you're good.
993640	996160	Yeah, being in time is what he's most famous for.
997920	999120	Even though, I mean, he wrote a lot.
999120	1001520	He has a lot of books, he has a lot of papers.
1001520	1004360	His later work differs a little bit from his early work,
1004360	1008400	but there's also a dispute as to how real the turn is.
1010600	1012640	The later Heidegger and the early Heidegger, yeah.
1012640	1015840	Yeah, and I'm not really knowledgeable enough
1015840	1019080	to comment on how different those two things are.
1019080	1020840	I'm kind of working my way chronologically
1020840	1022320	through this moment's work.
1024240	1026440	But yeah, in being in time,
1026440	1028360	and his earlier lecture course,
1030560	1035040	he describes phenomenology by going back to the ways
1035040	1040040	in which the Greeks use the term phenomenon in logos.
1040400	1044200	So he's kind of taking apart the term phenomenology
1044240	1048560	and separating it and looking
1048560	1051920	to the Greek definitions of this.
1051920	1055960	And in the book, Heidegger says that, you know,
1055960	1058920	that the Greeks understood the term phenomenon
1058920	1063800	as this is gonna sound very obscure and esoteric,
1063800	1065920	but I'm gonna give hopefully an easier
1065920	1067880	to understand description afterward.
1067880	1071800	But he says, phenomenon is that which shows itself
1071800	1073720	in itself, which is a manifest.
1073720	1075200	Typical Heidegger.
1075200	1080200	Yeah, and the term for the Greeks also carried connotation
1080480	1083640	of like bringing something to light and illuminating.
1085080	1088080	And then the logos, Heidegger explains,
1088080	1091040	the Greeks understood by the logos,
1091040	1092480	something like discoursing,
1092480	1094760	but not just like, not just dial fuck
1094760	1096280	and not just a verbal utterance,
1096280	1099200	but it's more of a discursive communication
1099200	1102880	that lets something be seen.
1104040	1109040	And so you could think of the logos as words,
1109400	1112300	whether utter or written down or what have you,
1114080	1117640	that point to something, they let something be seen.
1117640	1120240	It's kind of, it's bringing something to light,
1120240	1122160	it's bringing the phenomenon to light.
1122160	1124840	And so we wanna understand this in a less obscure
1124840	1127400	and difficult way than Heidegger likes to put things.
1129120	1132400	We can say something like, the logos points
1132400	1134280	to the phenomenon in such a way
1134280	1136600	that the phenomenon becomes un-concealed
1136600	1139360	or the logos allows the phenomenon to come into view
1139360	1141440	by looking and out of experience
1141440	1142960	in such a way that it can be seen.
1142960	1146560	And so really it's almost like your words should connect
1146560	1149760	with something that can be pointed out in experience
1149760	1152000	or can be shown in experience.
1152000	1155200	And so we're not, and he contrasts this
1155200	1159760	with the idea of free-floating concepts and words and ideas.
1160760	1164160	And by that, he just means something like,
1164160	1167920	we don't wanna abstract away so much from experience
1167920	1171400	that we're just playing language games.
1171400	1175640	We want our words to be able to meet up with experience
1175640	1179840	in such a way that if I say something,
1179840	1181800	so like in some of my papers about meaning
1181800	1183040	what I'm trying to do,
1183040	1185360	that I'm trying to point to experience,
1185360	1188240	I'm trying to point to particular experiences
1188240	1192320	and particular moments in particular experiences
1192320	1195680	where maybe someone might find meaning.
1195680	1200680	So I'm not, I'm just trying to bring something into view
1201360	1203320	using words and concepts.
1204880	1205920	I'm glad you said that, Jacob,
1205920	1209440	because in one of your papers, I forget which one,
1209440	1210760	you've sort of touched on this,
1210760	1214160	but a question that came to mind was,
1214160	1216520	so from the definition you gave,
1216520	1218480	definition of phenomenology,
1218480	1221320	how does that differ from, let's say,
1221320	1223960	the empiricist tradition or the empiricist approach,
1223960	1227480	which tends to be quite popular these days,
1227480	1230000	especially in the world of artificial intelligence,
1230000	1233880	where we think that our epistemology or our knowledge
1233880	1236400	or our truths of the world is revealed
1236400	1238760	purely based on empiricism,
1238760	1241840	which is experiencing measuring things
1241840	1245000	and that in some sense, the mind is a blank canvas
1245000	1248480	and the world just gives us information and input.
1248480	1250120	So from the empirical approach,
1250120	1251880	how does phenomenology differ?
1253520	1256040	So phenomenology is gonna differ in the sense that,
1256040	1258480	okay, so if we think about the empirical approach,
1258480	1261720	specifically as it pertains to the sciences,
1265160	1268560	we're trying to get a collection of experiences
1268560	1271040	that kind of compile and point toward the same
1271040	1272440	sort of thing in experience.
1273200	1278200	Now, the major difference I guess is going to be
1278360	1282120	what it is we're trying to discern in empirical science
1282120	1284640	as opposed to something like Heidegger's phenomenology
1284640	1287040	or the way that I just described phenomenology.
1289840	1293040	With a scientific and empirical approach,
1293040	1297080	we're usually looking at objects
1297080	1298880	and we're trying to figure out
1298880	1300920	what sort of properties these objects have.
1301920	1306760	And so, I mean, I guess physics or chemistry
1306760	1308360	is a great example of that.
1308360	1311920	And we're trying to see maybe what house to entities
1311920	1313240	interact with each other.
1314560	1317160	And we're going to perform experiments to do that
1317160	1320360	and we're gonna try to replicate the experiments.
1320360	1323600	And we're gonna try to not let our first person
1323600	1328600	perspective influence exactly what we're investigating.
1329400	1332360	So, phenomenology is gonna differ from that.
1332360	1334040	In that we're not collecting data
1334040	1336160	and we're not measuring stuff.
1336160	1338200	We're experiencing, we're trying to pay attention
1338200	1340560	to the experience as it's experienced.
1340560	1344440	So, you're not gonna measure your experience of meaning,
1344440	1348240	say you're going to more so,
1348240	1350040	if you're doing a phenomenology
1350040	1353920	and you're trying to discern maybe what you find meaningful,
1353920	1358200	you're going to more so reflect on maybe
1358200	1360000	the way that you feel
1360000	1362880	when you were participating in a certain activity.
1363960	1366840	And from there, you might also start to look
1366840	1370800	at the structures of the experience,
1370800	1373160	more so than just the feeling of the experience,
1373160	1376960	which might be what's involved in this activity
1376960	1378960	or what's involved in this experience.
1380440	1382200	What are the things that are essential
1382200	1385280	to the experience without which I could no longer say
1385280	1387560	that it was a meaningful experience.
1387600	1388720	Those are the sorts of things
1388720	1392080	that sort of questions phenomenology is going to ask
1392080	1393800	and specifically high digger
1393800	1396360	because specifically for high digger,
1396360	1401360	he's wanting to discern the a priori structures
1402800	1404640	of existence and experience,
1404640	1409120	which is just to say a priori meaning
1410320	1411320	always already there.
1411320	1413320	Like what's necessary?
1414720	1416960	What are the, what structures are necessary
1417000	1418480	for this to exist
1418480	1420840	or for me to have this particular experience?
1425840	1427080	Yeah, I guess I'll leave it at that for now
1427080	1429360	because otherwise I'm going to get into a really deep,
1429360	1431120	or you can ask a clarifying question
1431120	1433120	because otherwise I'm just going to go on at the end.
1433120	1434600	No, that was perfect, mate.
1436680	1439800	I think in many ways you lead me to my next question.
1439800	1441960	I mean, I thought we were going to discuss
1441960	1445360	existentialism too because obviously it's kind of
1445360	1447240	like the precursor or not the precursor,
1447240	1450320	but it's highly correlated to phenomenology.
1450320	1452840	But perhaps since we're already on this topic,
1455000	1457800	in some sense, I kind of regret even asking that question
1457800	1461360	because I'm coming to realize that maybe it's not fair
1461360	1465840	to ask questions such as, oh, what's the difference
1465840	1467720	or what's the stark difference
1467720	1470960	between phenomenology and science?
1470960	1474160	Because if you think of a field like let's say psychology
1474160	1476120	or cognitive science,
1476120	1478440	those fields have had a massive influence
1478440	1481400	by thinkers like Merleau Ponty
1481400	1483840	or Heidegger by phenomenologists.
1485200	1487960	So, well, the question I was going to ask is,
1487960	1491440	how does phenomenology, and I was also going to say
1491440	1493360	existentialism, but we didn't get to that still,
1493360	1496600	but let's just say, how does phenomenology differ
1496600	1499360	from a more scientific approach?
1499360	1501760	But maybe to make things even a bit more interesting,
1501760	1505360	let's talk about, in fact, how does it relate
1505360	1507720	to fields like psychology and cognitive science
1507720	1510200	where in the scientific approach,
1510200	1513240	what we always try and do is remove the subject,
1513240	1515280	so remove the subjective experience.
1515280	1519000	But clearly, there are some fields even within science,
1519000	1519840	but you can't do that.
1519840	1521440	You can't remove the subject
1521440	1523880	from cognitive science or psychology.
1523880	1526200	So maybe to make things a bit more interesting,
1526200	1528280	how do they correlate, how do they connect
1528280	1530580	to phenomenology, those fields I mentioned?
1531540	1532380	Sure, sure.
1533740	1536060	So I want to comment on cognitive science
1536060	1537940	just a little bit first, and then I want to maybe dive
1537940	1539500	into a little bit of neuroscience
1539500	1541620	and how phenomenology might be related,
1541620	1545740	because I actually presented a paper last year
1545740	1549020	at a philosophy conference hosted by a university
1549020	1550900	in the Czech Republic on this topic
1550900	1552100	of phenomenology neuroscience.
1552100	1554740	But before I get to that, you know,
1554740	1558420	something that I really appreciate about cognitive science
1558420	1563420	is that it really embraces the subjective experience.
1566180	1568660	And like you said, you can't remove that
1568660	1572620	from cognitive science, cognitive science necessarily.
1572620	1577620	And I mean, so they're, I think the most prevailing approach
1580780	1583260	in cognitive science right now is 4E cognitive science,
1583260	1584740	and that's just the 440s.
1584740	1587700	I always forget one, but it stands for embeddedness
1587780	1590660	and embodied, inactive, and I, like I said,
1590660	1592380	I always forget the fourth one.
1592380	1594460	I don't know why, but...
1594460	1596860	I'll leave a little caption on whatever,
1596860	1599740	just too far, if it was all good, yeah.
1599740	1602740	Yeah, have somebody place in the comment where I'm from.
1602740	1606140	Kind of take the video, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine.
1606140	1611140	But a lot of the, so a lot of those ideas really,
1613020	1616060	I mean, I believe have an inception in phenomenology.
1616060	1619620	I mean, they're, you know, especially in Heidegger,
1619620	1621860	with Heidegger's idea of being in the world,
1621860	1623780	you know, which we'll get to.
1625380	1628900	But it's just this idea that there's a more holistic structure
1628900	1632580	to the world and the existence
1632580	1634580	that we need to take into consideration
1634580	1637100	when we're trying to understand things about the world
1637100	1640340	and trying to understand things about ourselves
1640340	1643620	and maybe the way in which we interact with the environment.
1644460	1649460	And so, I think phenomenology played at least the role
1649820	1651900	in trying and getting a lot of those ideas
1651900	1654060	going for cognitive science.
1656700	1658540	Now, as far as neuroscience goes,
1662860	1665020	Anil Seth, I'm sure you've heard of Anil Seth.
1665020	1666180	Yes, I have, yeah.
1666180	1669060	He recently wrote a quite a popular science book
1669060	1669980	right on the brain.
1670980	1674980	And so he does a lot of work trying to map
1677540	1681060	the brain correlates of certain experiences.
1681060	1683380	So he's trying to see like what's going on in the brain
1683380	1686980	at a given time when someone's having a particular experience.
1686980	1690220	And he's trying to build that map out.
1690220	1692980	And you can't build that map
1692980	1695540	if you don't have good phenomenology.
1695540	1699220	Because if you think, just think about it,
1699260	1700900	if we think about it simply,
1700900	1705900	as far as, okay, let's say brain region X lights up
1706820	1709820	when I have experience Y.
1709820	1712980	And let's say we can gather all the data we want
1712980	1714580	about the brain structure
1714580	1718580	and we can reproduce it and map it as much as we want.
1718580	1721180	But if we don't have a good description of the experience,
1721180	1722660	we're not gonna know what we're mapping
1722660	1725100	this brain activity to.
1725100	1729140	And so in order to have good correlative mapping,
1729140	1730620	we have to have good phenomenology.
1730620	1733620	We have to have like a good description of the experience.
1733620	1737540	And we have to have people, the participants in the study
1737540	1738500	that they're studying,
1738500	1741660	trying to get this correlative mapping going.
1741660	1743980	They have to be familiar with the experience,
1743980	1746140	not only as it is experienced,
1746140	1747860	but they have to understand what it is
1747860	1750380	that the neuroscientists are trying to map.
1750380	1753380	Like what experience do you want me to have?
1753380	1754780	So then I can tell you what I'm having
1754860	1759860	and so you can mark down what's going on in my brain
1759860	1761620	when I'm having that experience.
1761620	1765420	And so you have to have a whole lot of phenomenology going on.
1765420	1770220	Not only the participant being able to recognize the experience
1770220	1774340	and being able to communicate that to the researchers,
1774340	1776660	but the researchers also have to have
1776660	1778780	a pretty rich phenomenological description
1778780	1783340	of what it is they want their participants to experience.
1783340	1787580	And that way they know precisely when the experience has started
1787580	1789700	because I mean, there might be like a very important,
1789700	1790540	as far as neuroscience,
1790540	1793300	so there might be a very important spike
1793300	1795460	in a particular brain region
1795460	1799020	that they are trying to map to a very specific,
1799020	1804020	maybe milliseconds of an experience.
1804420	1805500	And if you don't get that right,
1805500	1806540	it's just not going to be correct.
1806540	1807660	Your description is going to be wrong
1807660	1809780	and your correlative mapping isn't going to mean anything
1809780	1812980	because you might have one side of it,
1812980	1816900	or you're going to be missing the other side of it.
1816900	1821980	But also Jacob, what makes phenomenology even beyond, let's say,
1821980	1824380	that because see what we are talking about here,
1824380	1826260	it's how can I put this?
1826260	1829140	So, oh, by the way, so the book Anil said,
1829140	1832180	the person you were talking about, it's called Being You.
1832180	1834700	So it's a very, I think it's a neuroscientific approach
1834700	1837940	to experience, but what that got me thinking
1837940	1839580	was as you were describing things,
1839580	1843340	we're thinking of very localized experiences.
1843340	1845340	So like, here's this pen, it's a black pen.
1845340	1846700	I'm looking at it.
1846700	1848260	What's my, to use a term,
1848260	1850100	philosophers use qualia, let's say,
1850100	1852140	and which parts of my brain likes it.
1852140	1855100	But when it comes to phenomenology, of course,
1855100	1856260	we even go beyond that.
1856260	1859660	We even go to what you write a lot about,
1859660	1862740	which is meaning and kind of the questions
1862740	1865500	that truly make us human in that sense, right?
1865500	1869180	So, and is that where we could maybe connect that
1869180	1871060	to fields such as psychology?
1873220	1875500	So I think, I mean, yeah, we could connect to there,
1875500	1879140	but I think we could still even bring it back
1879140	1881980	to neuroscience in the sense of,
1881980	1886940	so I know there was some research done,
1886940	1891940	trying to map brain activity and experiences of happiness.
1893660	1898500	And this particular study didn't even have a description
1898500	1901940	of what a happy experience might be as experienced.
1901940	1905140	And so, that was one of the experiments
1905140	1907420	that I pointed to in my paper where I said,
1908780	1911660	I mean, they admit that one of the more difficult parts
1911660	1912700	of what they were trying to do
1912700	1916100	is the phenomenal, a lot of logical aspect of it.
1917100	1918580	But at the end of the day, it's like,
1918580	1920300	I mean, it doesn't really,
1920300	1921740	that research can't really mean anything
1921740	1925540	until you have a good description
1925540	1927180	of what a happy experience is.
1927420	1929780	And it's very difficult to do
1929780	1932820	because obviously not everything's gonna make everybody happy.
1932820	1934460	We're gonna have different,
1934460	1936780	not necessarily definitions of what happiness is,
1936780	1938020	although we might have that too,
1938020	1941860	but different experiences are gonna make me happy
1941860	1944980	and different experiences are gonna make you happy.
1944980	1946260	And that gets even more complicated
1946260	1948060	when we start talking about meaning.
1949020	1952180	But another good example of this in neuroscience
1952180	1954020	is the flow experience.
1954020	1956700	So they're trying to kind of map out
1956700	1957620	what's going on in the brain
1957620	1959460	when somebody has an experience of flow.
1959460	1961780	And not only is flow,
1963260	1964820	I wouldn't say it's a rare experience
1964820	1966220	for a lot of people,
1966220	1970700	but it's also not an everyday sort of experience for people.
1970700	1972300	And so it can be a little elusive.
1972300	1974820	And again, so I think when we're talking
1974820	1975860	about something like that,
1975860	1980620	we're trying to do some neuroscientific research
1980620	1982740	about flow and the flow experience,
1982740	1984820	we need to have good phenomenology
1984820	1986180	and we need to have good communication
1986180	1987860	around the experience in order,
1990140	1992820	I guess really in order to have good research
1992820	1995300	and to be able to expand our knowledge
1995300	1998900	of what it is that's going on when we're in flow.
2000300	2005300	And I'm very critical of science for a lot of reasons,
2005700	2008420	but I also think it's,
2008420	2009540	I mean, we need science,
2009540	2012420	I'm not a science denier of any sort.
2012420	2016380	And I love seeing good research around these topics.
2016380	2018820	It's just unfortunate that there's a lot of the research
2018820	2019660	to just poor research
2019660	2023460	because they kind of shit on philosophy a lot.
2023460	2026100	And so I think it's philosophical discipline.
2026100	2028820	I think from what I read in one of your papers,
2028820	2030460	you've even used this term,
2030460	2034260	it seems like you're critical of scientism, isn't it?
2034260	2035900	It's not science per se,
2035900	2039140	where scientism is this, like it's an ontology.
2039220	2042540	The part replaces the whole.
2042540	2044740	And in fact, I was watching this interview,
2044740	2046260	sorry, I'm going off on a tangent here,
2046260	2048100	but that's okay, it's at the conversation.
2048100	2051060	I was watching an interview and Slavoj Zizek said that,
2051060	2053060	that the modern problem is,
2053060	2054580	the ultimate questions,
2054580	2056980	do we have free will, what is consciousness?
2057980	2060180	Even questions pertaining to meaning,
2060180	2064460	we've localized those questions to the scientific domain
2064460	2066300	where historically,
2066300	2068580	those things were normally answered by philosophers
2068580	2070140	and philosophers have the ability
2070140	2071420	to pull it from different disciplines
2071420	2073460	and kind of connect them all together,
2073460	2077060	where science, it's affected by what science is,
2077060	2078140	doesn't allow that.
2079100	2081540	So it seems that scientism is the problem.
2081540	2084940	And okay, I'm thinking how are we gonna do this?
2084940	2086700	So I wanna get to,
2086700	2090220	because I think this perfectly connects to your,
2090220	2093620	not your paper, but the article you wrote on Epoch Magazine,
2093620	2098180	which was the structure of meaning and experience,
2098220	2102020	rediscovering that which has been lost, that article.
2103060	2106620	But we didn't discuss existentialism yet.
2106620	2109820	So, since we're on the topic of meaning,
2109820	2113260	maybe we could give like a bit of a prelude
2113260	2115100	to what existentialism is
2115100	2116380	and how that pertains to meaning
2116380	2118020	and then we'll get to your article,
2118020	2120340	because if not, I feel like we're gonna get carried away.
2120340	2123100	I also have a few more questions about Heidegger,
2123100	2126100	but I certainly wanna discuss what you've written.
2126100	2128580	So Jacob, like maybe we'll start with existentialism
2128580	2131660	and then we'll move on to your article, if that's all right.
2134660	2139660	So I understand existentialism as a philosophical study
2139700	2143540	of the human condition and all of its guts and glory,
2143540	2148540	because I say that because a lot of existentialism
2149100	2152340	is around kind of gutsy topics like death
2152420	2157340	and it can seem kind of dark,
2157340	2158260	especially when we're talking about things
2158260	2163220	like anxiety and dread, but it's really,
2163220	2165540	it's just an attempt to try to understand
2165540	2169980	the human condition and all of its facets.
2169980	2173380	I mean, so we have the human as the essential subject
2173380	2176180	and not just like the biological human
2176180	2178560	or the physical human, but more than that,
2178560	2183040	we have the experiencing human.
2183040	2184480	And so, I mean, we can see already
2184480	2187000	how it can connect up with phenomenology nicely.
2187960	2191840	But I mean, the existentialists are gonna ponder questions,
2191840	2194240	like what does it mean to live and die?
2196440	2198360	What should I be doing with my life?
2199500	2200720	Should I act responsibly?
2200720	2202640	Do I have, what kind of freedom do I have?
2202640	2203800	Do I have any freedom?
2205240	2206160	What does death mean?
2206160	2207160	Is there meaning in life?
2207160	2209440	Is everything just meaningless?
2209440	2214440	So, I guess very human questions
2215920	2219320	that most of us have probably thought about at some point.
2221520	2226360	And it's approached in a rigorous manner, though.
2226360	2227960	So I guess that's what makes it,
2227960	2232960	I feel like thinking about these things in a loose manner.
2233960	2237080	So it's approaching these very human clashes
2237080	2239040	in a more rigorous manner.
2239880	2243040	Yeah, what's interesting is we've got colloquial terms
2243040	2247880	such as existential dread or existential crisis.
2247880	2250360	It seems like those terms wouldn't even exist
2250360	2254160	if not for the existentialists themselves
2254160	2255880	writing about these topics.
2255880	2258800	And even with an existentialism,
2258800	2260800	it's starting from caricature to nature
2261160	2264000	to the French existentialist or, of course, Heidegger,
2264000	2265520	which is why, you know,
2265520	2267840	what probably perhaps what makes philosophy interesting,
2267840	2270960	you can never say this is what existentialism is, right?
2270960	2275200	It's the thinkers themselves don't agree with each other.
2275200	2276960	And in fact, people such as Camus,
2276960	2279600	who we would think as an existentialist,
2279600	2280760	rejected that term.
2281680	2285080	But I think you put it best check.
2285080	2286840	The way I think about it is that
2286840	2289120	it's the ultimate human questions,
2289120	2291880	leaving aside obstruous detached metaphysics
2291880	2295200	and coming back to our human experience.
2295200	2296880	And that, speaking about experience,
2296880	2299600	that leads us to your article.
2299600	2301440	So I'll reread the title,
2301440	2303960	The Structure of Meaning and Experience.
2303960	2306440	By the way, not to fatter you too much,
2306440	2308080	you are a brilliant writer, mate.
2308080	2310880	I aspire to write like you one day,
2310880	2313920	especially on such obstruous topics.
2313920	2316200	It's well written, it's well written.
2317120	2318120	Thank you.
2318120	2319760	The structure of meaning experience,
2319760	2322520	we discovering that which has been lost.
2322520	2324880	So obviously I read the article,
2324880	2327960	but for let's say for anyone who hasn't read it,
2327960	2331560	maybe give a bit of a summary
2331560	2332920	of what you were trying to cover
2332920	2335200	and convey in this article.
2335200	2338120	Obviously all the links down below the description.
2338120	2339920	And this one's on Epoch Magazine.
2342120	2347120	Yeah, so I will preface what I'm going to say
2347960	2352960	with the very honest answer that,
2354040	2355720	honest comments that I'm a better writer
2355720	2356560	than a speaker.
2356560	2357600	So if you're listening to this
2357600	2359440	and I sound like I'm all over the place,
2359440	2364280	I would ask if you read some of my papers and articles,
2364280	2365240	it might make more sense.
2365240	2368000	I could be all over the place when I talk.
2368000	2371320	Okay, so anyway, so in that article,
2373120	2376080	you know, it was one of the first articles,
2376560	2377640	I guess not one of the first,
2377640	2379040	but one of the first that I published
2379040	2381920	about meaning and meaningfulness.
2381920	2384480	And I was really trying to work out in that article,
2384480	2386480	kind of what my own perspective was on it
2386480	2388280	and how I wanted to communicate
2388280	2390360	what I was thinking about meaning.
2392440	2396040	And so I really liked that article for that reason
2396040	2401040	because I think it's almost like a foundational piece
2401880	2406880	of writing that shows me the direction that I need to go
2407320	2410640	and to try to illuminate these ideas a little bit more.
2410640	2413880	But in general, what I'm doing in the article
2413880	2418520	is trying to go through and talk about
2418520	2423080	where we can find meaning and experience as it's experienced.
2423080	2426360	And so I'm not appealing to analytic arguments
2426360	2429640	to try to convince you that meaning is real in that article,
2429680	2431960	which is what a lot of analytical philosophy is.
2431960	2436760	It's kind of creating a coherent argument
2436760	2439520	to try to convince or persuade someone
2439520	2443040	that something is true and they're often very isolated.
2443040	2446080	I try to take a holistic and phenomenological approach.
2446080	2449120	And so I'm trying to point to certain experiences
2449120	2451880	where I think people have found meaning
2451880	2453680	and where I have personally found meaning
2453680	2456320	and where people that I've talked to have said,
2456320	2458480	yeah, I find this really meaningful.
2458480	2459760	I've been trying to talk about the structures
2459760	2463480	of that a little bit and also eliminating those structures
2463480	2468480	also means describing what's necessary in the experience
2472040	2474000	or what might be necessary in the experience
2474000	2477120	for it to be a truly meaningful experience.
2478880	2483120	And I'll leave the introduction to that at that
2483120	2485360	and then see what questions you might wanna ask.
2485360	2486200	Sure.
2488040	2490720	So, you know, meaning seems again,
2490720	2493680	like one of those terms like consciousness,
2493680	2496920	which is, it seems to be a bit of a loaded term, isn't it?
2496920	2500880	So what for you is a meaningful life?
2503480	2506600	So I like to, so like you said,
2506600	2511600	it's a meaning is a very obscure and ambiguous term.
2512600	2516600	And I like to link, I like to link this back to,
2519880	2521600	was it a priori or a gust, I think it was a gust,
2521600	2523400	that said something about time.
2524720	2526800	I know what time is and so somebody asked me what it is.
2526800	2529800	And then when I'm asked, you know, I really,
2529800	2532120	I can't figure it out, I can't give a description
2532120	2533720	or I can't explain what time is.
2535720	2539520	Or you could say, or you could say meaning is like pornography.
2539560	2541480	He knew it when you see it.
2541480	2542680	You know when you see it.
2542680	2543880	Yeah, I mean, you know, actually,
2543880	2547640	I think that's a great, a great, a great,
2550000	2553200	I purposefully did not give an analytic definition
2553200	2557360	of meaning in that article or really in any paper of,
2557360	2561480	because I think giving a definition of it
2561480	2564480	is kind of doing an injustice to it
2564480	2567280	because it's a sort of thing.
2567280	2568840	So you have to experience it.
2568840	2570360	So you know it when you feel it,
2570360	2573120	you know it when you experience it.
2573120	2575680	And so that's another reason why,
2575680	2578040	rather than try to tell people what meaning is,
2578040	2579520	for me, a meaningful life.
2579520	2583200	And I will say that I,
2584400	2586760	relative, not subjective, but relative,
2586760	2588840	and I think there's a very important difference.
2588840	2591680	It's gonna be relative to each of our personal existences
2591680	2596680	and that we find value in the things
2597680	2600000	that make us feel purpose,
2600000	2600840	the things that sort of,
2600840	2603160	the things that like to vitalize us,
2603160	2604600	give us vitality, give us,
2606600	2610280	almost as zest, you know, as zest for life.
2611360	2615500	That I like to point to as indicators of meaning.
2615500	2619080	For me, a meaningful life is doing philosophy and writing
2619080	2622480	and having a few close friendships
2622520	2626800	and having a loving family.
2626800	2630400	And I think all of these things are important
2630400	2631960	for a holistic meaning.
2631960	2635200	Now, in the article that we're talking about right now,
2635200	2637360	I focused in on one type of meaning
2637360	2640520	because I think it's the easiest to point to an experience
2640520	2642880	and that's like a passionate activity.
2642880	2646600	So I use the artist as an example in that article.
2647520	2649360	But it could just as well be a scientist,
2649360	2652280	it could just as well be a philosopher, a writer.
2653640	2656440	You know, I don't think you can put a limitation
2656440	2658120	on what sort of activities are meaningful
2658120	2661360	because that would just be quite absurd
2661360	2664080	because I'm sure somebody finds something very meaningful
2664080	2666760	that I would absolutely dread doing.
2666760	2668560	And actually I know that's the case.
2669560	2673160	And so it's gonna be relative.
2673160	2675640	So I can say what's meaningful for me
2675640	2678640	and I can try to describe what's meaningful
2680360	2681400	for other people.
2683200	2685480	Not in the sense that I'm gonna tell you
2685480	2686640	what you're gonna find meaningful
2686640	2688920	but in the sense that this person
2688920	2693920	that has practiced a specific discipline,
2694320	2697360	a specific art maybe for their entire lives
2697360	2702360	and it's kind of like what they breathe and live
2704440	2707000	and it's their guiding passion.
2707360	2710240	I mean, I think that's a very good indicator
2710240	2713080	that they're finding something incredibly meaningful
2713080	2714360	about that endeavor.
2717040	2720900	And meaning certainly is not the same as happiness.
2722520	2725080	There's a lot of times where I'm writing
2725080	2727160	and studying philosophy where I'm not getting
2727160	2731480	some sort of immediate happy feeling from it
2731480	2733000	or pleasure out of it.
2733000	2736800	Sometimes it's very difficult and frustrating
2736800	2741080	but there's maybe a transcendent value that
2744200	2746960	I guess to use it, I'm gonna use the phrase
2746960	2750000	that you used last time we chatted.
2750000	2754400	It's soul edified, it lifts the spirit
2754400	2758480	in a way that is distinct from happiness and pleasure.
2760440	2763720	But it's a passion.
2767160	2769640	Yeah, I'll just say, I'll leave it at that.
2769640	2772600	Yeah, because I mean, look, passions, it's an amazing,
2772600	2776120	I in fact have a question, not pertaining to this article
2776120	2779080	but one of your other papers where in fact
2779080	2781640	you've used the word passion extensively,
2782920	2785360	the title of the papers.
2785360	2788560	You said that this is gonna be published soon in a,
2788560	2791000	so sorry, let me read out the title first,
2791000	2794720	passion as a disclosure of meaningfulness in life.
2794720	2796440	This hasn't been published yet, isn't it?
2796440	2799960	You said it's gonna be published in a journal soon.
2799960	2801440	So that paper is still in review.
2801440	2804960	I have not gotten a communication as to whether it will be
2804960	2809960	published or not, the ontology of meaning paper,
2812960	2815240	that one's gonna be published in
2815240	2817480	Countess Journal of Philosophy in 2023.
2817480	2819120	Sure, sure, sure.
2819120	2821280	But maybe if people are interested,
2821280	2825520	they could probably tweet at you if you don't mind of course
2825560	2827400	and if they're interested in reading the paper,
2827400	2828480	because I don't wanna leave it,
2828480	2829560	because then I'll publish it,
2829560	2831560	I'm not gonna share them publicly.
2831560	2834280	Sure, yeah, someone's interested.
2834280	2837000	So yeah, I can't really circulate it
2837000	2842000	until I really have a decision from the journal,
2842960	2844800	but if anybody's interested in reading it
2844800	2846080	or looking over it or discussing it,
2846080	2850240	definitely reach out, I can send a PDF copy.
2850240	2851080	Yep, great.
2852000	2853600	All right, so meaning,
2853600	2856280	this probably leads us to
2856280	2858560	a bit of a Hadegarian question.
2858560	2860520	I was gonna discuss Hadegar separately,
2860520	2863680	but why discuss Hadegar abstractly?
2863680	2865320	He himself wouldn't like that.
2865320	2866880	Let's connect it to your work.
2868240	2873240	You've said that we live in a techno-scientific era
2875800	2879520	and you said that we are attempting to take a view
2879520	2881560	from nowhere in the modern world.
2882560	2885760	And when I read that bit,
2885760	2887280	I was even trying to connect that
2887280	2892280	to kind of this modern new age obsession with stoicism,
2892360	2895880	where it seems that everyone talks a lot about stoicism
2895880	2897480	being detached from the world.
2898560	2901160	And I don't know if that tightly correlates
2901160	2903520	to this idea of the view from nowhere.
2903520	2906000	Everything is just a cosmic phenomenon.
2906000	2908480	Nothing really matters in some sense, ultimately.
2909400	2914400	So I placed this question in two parts, Jacob.
2915600	2920600	Firstly, ultimately, what was Hadegar struggling with?
2921160	2924280	What was he trying to figure out in his work
2924280	2925760	and what were his concerns?
2925760	2927720	For instance, like in the essay,
2927720	2931840	a question concerning technology, essays like that.
2931840	2935600	And the second part of the question is, from his work,
2935640	2938640	how does that pertain to the question of meaning
2938640	2940120	and human experience?
2943240	2948240	So there is very upfront about the question
2950600	2954320	that he's asking, and it's, what is the meaning of being?
2954320	2957240	And that's so vague that nobody can get an idea
2957240	2958680	of what it is until they've read the whole book.
2958680	2962400	And then maybe you can understand the question after that.
2962400	2965800	But he's really just asking, in what sense,
2965800	2968240	in what sense do things exist?
2968240	2971600	I mean, that's kind of what he's asking.
2971600	2974000	Maybe an easier way to understand the question.
2975520	2978680	And so he asks this question,
2980240	2982560	and he says that we've, the tradition
2982560	2986040	has really forgotten about being and what being is.
2986040	2990040	And for Hadegar, and this is gonna kind of
2990040	2992800	come back around to his approach to phenomenology
2992800	2996080	as far as the idea that he thinks phenomenology should
2999120	3004120	discover or disclose the apriori structures of existence.
3004840	3008240	And so being for Hadegar is synonymous
3008240	3013080	with the apriori ontological structures of existence.
3013080	3017720	So the structures of experience and existence
3017720	3021000	that are necessary for us to be having the experience
3021000	3022400	that we're having right now.
3026480	3031480	And this is, so we can contrast this with science,
3033880	3038160	most certainly, and also traditional philosophy,
3038160	3040040	because traditional philosophy and science
3040040	3044280	is kind of working in this subject-object sort of framework,
3044320	3047080	and they're also working within mostly
3047080	3049400	a substance-based framework.
3049400	3053600	So we have a substance, so we have objects,
3053600	3056400	and objects are made out of a substance.
3056400	3058560	And what kind of properties does these objects have?
3058560	3062720	And this is another reason, I mean, and this is direct.
3062720	3065000	The reason why he was so against Descartes
3065000	3067280	and had a lot of criticisms of Descartes,
3067280	3069720	because Descartes is kind of perpetuating
3069720	3072920	these philosophical assumptions that he thinks
3072920	3075040	that Hadegar thinks are completely unfounded,
3075040	3079480	such as, I mean, what is it to be,
3079480	3081080	like what is the human person,
3081080	3086080	and Descartes's gonna say this immaterial consciousness,
3086080	3087520	that's the person.
3087520	3090880	So we're a substance, where he's bringing us back
3091960	3095640	to the substance-based sort of metaphysics.
3095640	3098920	Hadegar basically says, no, this is all wrong.
3098920	3101240	We need to look at being, and we can't look at being
3101240	3103400	when we're trying to look at objects and the properties,
3103400	3108400	because in order for us to even look at objects
3109080	3110960	in their property, so in a sense,
3110960	3113760	in order to even have an empirical science
3113760	3117080	that can try to discern properties
3117080	3119200	of certain substances and certain objects,
3120280	3123520	we need all these other things already in place,
3123520	3124920	and that's what he's pointing to
3124920	3126800	with the aphriora structures.
3129320	3131080	And so that's kind of what Hadegar is up to,
3131120	3132520	in being in time, really.
3133480	3138480	And he's gonna say that we're sense-making beings.
3138640	3142040	I mean, we make sense out of all of our experiences,
3143360	3148360	and he goes through in very complex detail
3152000	3153120	what these structures are,
3153120	3157400	and kind of what the holistic structure of them is.
3157400	3160320	And so we have feeling, I mean, we have a thinless sky,
3160320	3162920	and that's one of the important things for my work
3162920	3165520	that I take from Hadegar is this idea that,
3167240	3170520	and the thinless sky is often translated as attunement.
3170520	3172800	And the popular translation is translated as state of mind,
3172800	3174200	but it's a very terrible translation
3174200	3177720	because Hadegar wanted nothing to do with states of mind.
3177720	3180520	And so attunement might be a better word for now.
3180520	3182160	Some people like to use this position,
3182160	3185920	but it's really just the way you find yourself in the world.
3185920	3187280	How are you attuned to the world?
3187280	3192280	And it has connotations of feelings and emotions
3192600	3194520	and that sort of thing.
3195920	3200520	And so that's just one of many apriori structures
3200520	3203640	that Hadegar is gonna talk about being attached.
3203640	3206800	And how does, okay, so first question is,
3208040	3212200	we talk about Hadegar's idea that we are being in the world,
3212200	3214760	and he's trying to make the statement that,
3214760	3219240	in fact, before we even think of our states of mind,
3219240	3221200	our conscious experience,
3221200	3223680	there are all these other structures
3223680	3225200	that presuppose all of that.
3225200	3227280	For us to even ask that question,
3227280	3229120	what is existence, what is consciousness?
3229120	3231640	There are many other things that come before that.
3231640	3233680	And is that what he kind of means by,
3233680	3235600	we are, obviously we're embodied beings,
3235600	3239480	but we're also in the world amongst other beings.
3239480	3243240	Yes, so being in the world, and it's all hyphenated.
3243240	3245640	So if somebody's listening and they haven't seen
3245640	3248000	the phrase written out in his book,
3248000	3252720	being hyphened in hyphened the hyphenate world is one.
3252720	3255400	And it's done that way because what Hadegar's trying
3255400	3258840	to signify with that is a unitary phenomenon.
3258840	3263840	He's trying to say, all of this comes together.
3264080	3268040	It's all codependent, it's an interdependent phenomenon.
3268040	3272720	We don't first exist and then try to find the world.
3272720	3275120	And our world doesn't first exist,
3275120	3277520	and then we kind of come into it.
3278920	3283440	But there's a interdependence and kind of co-manifestation
3283440	3286760	of existence and what he means by world.
3286760	3289440	And that's what being in the world is.
3289440	3293400	And so it's a holistic and interdependent sort of thing.
3297120	3300800	So if you look at how that pertains to meaning,
3301800	3305000	firstly, this is something I've struggled with.
3305000	3308600	For Hadegar, it seems like there's a world of facts,
3308600	3312520	but for the world to become true,
3312520	3316040	for those facts to have a truthfulness,
3316040	3318720	it requires a Dasein or a human being.
3318720	3320760	Dasein is the term he uses.
3320760	3323600	So then would he say that in some sense,
3323600	3328320	reality truly became reality as we know it now,
3328320	3333000	only after we came into being, we came to exist
3333000	3334720	and we were being in the world?
3335760	3339360	Or is that something he doesn't really talk about too much?
3339360	3341120	So he doesn't talk about it a whole lot.
3341120	3343600	There are some very, very difficult passages
3343600	3348040	that are still disputed today.
3348040	3350200	And I've had a lot of fun conversations
3350200	3352680	about these passages because they are very difficult
3352680	3355920	to try to discern what the heck he was meaning.
3355920	3359600	He also uses the word world
3359600	3362440	in three or four different ways in being in time,
3362440	3364640	but he's very precise about when he uses them
3364640	3366480	and he even tells you beforehand,
3366480	3368480	like if it's in quotes, this is what it means.
3368480	3371560	If it's capitalized, this is what it means.
3371560	3375120	So he has a good system.
3375120	3380120	He's not just erratic in throwing these words out there.
3380320	3381600	He knows what he means by them
3381600	3384680	and he tries to convey to us what he's meaning by them.
3385680	3389000	But to get back to your question,
3389960	3393400	yeah, in a very real way, what Heidegger is saying is,
3396520	3400120	reality as we know it, the world as we experience it,
3401160	3403640	the world as we articulate it,
3403640	3406400	whether that's in, you know, as facts or not,
3409760	3413560	only has been, it only is when Dazan is.
3415360	3419320	And the question arises, well,
3419320	3423200	if all human existence was to kind of fade out overnight
3423200	3424920	where the world disappeared
3424920	3426120	or whether there's still the world
3426120	3428120	or whether there's still the entities,
3428120	3428960	that sort of thing.
3428960	3433960	And Heidegger stays true to the phenomenological approach here
3435640	3440120	and he stays true to it in some other areas as well.
3440120	3441560	And what I mean by that is,
3442560	3444920	he doesn't give a definitive answer.
3444920	3447920	He kind of just says, well, if we're not here,
3447920	3450120	we don't really know what would be here.
3451960	3456200	So because phenomenology is looking to experience,
3456200	3460680	he can't make a phenomenological judgment about that.
3461600	3463680	And he is honest about that.
3463680	3466120	And then something that I appreciate about his approach
3466120	3471120	is that he doesn't overstep the limits of the method
3471360	3472200	that he's using.
3473600	3478600	And I mean, philosophy has argued about that forever,
3479520	3481960	whether the world exists independently or not.
3481960	3484600	And what Heidegger just says as well,
3484600	3487080	as far as our experience goes,
3489800	3493360	and as far as the way we articulate the meaning of being,
3495720	3497720	being only is while we are.
3497720	3502720	And it's obscure and it's sometimes frustrating
3503080	3506040	if you want a concrete answer
3507080	3510760	as to the independence or not of the world.
3510760	3513560	But he just kind of then follows up by saying,
3513560	3516920	well, if we're not here, we're not really gonna know.
3516920	3520160	And I don't think anybody's had an experience
3521360	3522360	absent the world.
3522360	3525600	And so I don't think anybody knows
3525600	3527320	what the answer to that is.
3529040	3532600	And so it's, to me, okay, so to me,
3532600	3536200	I appreciate the enigma, I appreciate the mystery behind it
3536200	3539760	because if we truly can't know,
3539760	3543360	maybe we can think through it and have a discourse about it
3543360	3548360	and it might be a very meaningful sort of thing
3549720	3552800	to talk about, but because we can't know,
3552800	3555040	we shouldn't pretend that we know.
3556360	3561360	Yeah, or, I mean, perhaps it even,
3561720	3564880	in some sense, Hattaker probably wouldn't even like us
3564880	3568720	just talking too abstractly about such things,
3568720	3570600	given that, again, like you said,
3570600	3575600	he would want us to stick to the phenomenological approach
3575600	3578080	where we're talking about structures of experience.
3578080	3581200	And for starters, if there aren't any structures,
3581200	3584040	there are some conversations we can't have
3584400	3587920	whereas at one point, it just becomes the term you use,
3587920	3590640	which I know is by Wittgenstein's language games.
3590640	3594640	At one point, which is why sometimes I think of
3594640	3598640	all these pop philosophy or pop science ideas,
3598640	3603640	like the many worlds theory or brain in a bat or what else?
3604120	3605920	Do we live in a matrix?
3605920	3610920	They really seem like futile or even useless efforts
3611920	3613880	or conversations to have because, again,
3613880	3617360	it doesn't pertain to a palpable actual experience.
3617360	3619480	It's just fully abstract.
3619480	3621640	And again, nothing wrong with abstracts.
3621640	3623240	Mathematics is fully abstract,
3623240	3626120	but look at how useful mathematics is.
3626120	3630120	But I'll get your point.
3630120	3632560	I think you explained quite well.
3632560	3637560	So Hattaker's idea of being in the world,
3638560	3642960	how does that relate to what you've discussed here?
3644240	3646280	Firstly, meaning and then,
3647920	3651560	well, perhaps more, more specifically, human meaning.
3652960	3654000	Sure.
3654000	3658320	Yeah, and so I will also clarify
3658320	3662040	since you added that caveat on at the end there,
3662040	3666280	I really only talked about meaning in relation to,
3666280	3668520	I have to pretend to humans,
3668520	3670920	meaning in the lives of humans.
3672120	3674440	I don't know if I'll ever transcend that
3674440	3676400	and talk about meaning as such,
3676400	3679480	but again, maybe that's not a phenomenologically appropriate
3679480	3681000	topic because I don't know,
3681000	3683040	outside of my human experience,
3683040	3685360	I don't know what meaning might be.
3687280	3689880	But so being in the world,
3691120	3695320	I think it kind of at least starts to give us,
3695320	3698560	well, for one, that's gonna be after you are a structure
3698560	3700640	to having an experience of meaning.
3700640	3703200	I mean, we're in the world,
3706160	3709280	not in a sort of container-like way,
3709280	3710880	like water is in the glass,
3710880	3715880	but we're the world and us are co-constituted in a sense.
3719760	3724680	And we have to,
3726320	3730800	I'm trying to think about how I want to phrase this.
3732720	3735840	I guess we have to involve ourselves in the world,
3735840	3737160	like we're always being in the world,
3737160	3739000	whenever abstracted away from the world
3739000	3740880	or else we wouldn't be living in,
3740880	3743040	where it would be an existing being.
3743040	3745800	So it's not that we're never not being in the world,
3747640	3749240	but I think it kind of points to this idea
3749240	3752240	that us in the world are closer than we think
3752240	3753960	and we're more interconnected than we think.
3753960	3757520	And if we sort of explore with,
3757520	3759400	we sort of explore the world
3759400	3762880	and various involvements that we might have with it,
3764080	3766120	we might stumble across something
3766120	3767320	that we find extremely meaningful.
3767320	3768840	And I think that's really the only way
3768840	3771480	that we can discover meaning.
3771480	3773360	I don't think we subjectively create meaning,
3773360	3776480	but I don't think meaning is also just objectively
3776480	3777320	out there in the world.
3777320	3780440	I think it's a relational phenomenon.
3780440	3782640	So I guess that the concept of being in the world
3782680	3787120	also points to that idea that it's a interdependent
3787120	3789480	and relational sort of thing.
3792000	3796160	And we might also, in the process,
3796160	3798240	discover a lot of things that we don't like
3798240	3799720	and that we don't find meaningful
3799720	3802320	or we find the opposite there that we find meaningless.
3802320	3805240	But I think that's also just closer
3805240	3806560	to what we find meaningful
3806560	3809640	because you don't really know until you have the experience.
3809640	3812600	You don't really know until you involve yourself
3813200	3815840	in the activity or what have you.
3818240	3821800	And so it's an experiential relational thing
3821800	3826800	and being in the world is kind of just a necessary structure
3830760	3833600	for us to be able to go out there and try to find meaning.
3833600	3834880	If we weren't being in the world,
3834880	3836080	we were not existing.
3837440	3838600	That's well put.
3838600	3842520	That is well, I think you hit the nail on the head there.
3842520	3845200	So being in the world is, in fact,
3845200	3849320	what's necessary to even discover meaning.
3851440	3853560	Okay, okay.
3853560	3856440	Because another thing I realized
3856440	3859000	was perhaps one of the most important things
3859000	3860360	Jerome Reiki did
3860360	3862600	to the contemporary philosophical conversation
3862600	3865840	is that he started asking the question
3865840	3870120	from meaning of life to meaning in life.
3870120	3872200	And Heidegger would probably fall on the latter camp
3873040	3875040	where what he worries about
3875040	3877240	or his concerns are meaning in life.
3877240	3878520	For him, meaning of life is again,
3878520	3880000	one of those useless questions.
3881280	3885440	Yeah, and you know, Heidegger uses the term meaning a lot
3885440	3889640	but he generally, what he means by that
3889640	3893320	is generally the way in which I just used it,
3893320	3895080	like the sense that something has,
3896520	3898120	making sense of something.
3898960	3902400	So the German term that he uses a lot of sin,
3902400	3906080	S-I-N-N, and it can be translated as meaning
3906080	3908200	but it can also be translated as sense.
3908200	3912080	So Heidegger doesn't really talk about meaning in life
3912080	3914240	as much as like making sense of things in life
3914240	3916240	and making sense of the world.
3916240	3918160	And that's another reason why I thought that
3918160	3921040	because I think Heidegger gets a lot of things right.
3921040	3923360	I think he gets a lot of things correct
3923360	3924960	with his fundamental analysis.
3924960	3927440	And it's very like the fundamental structures
3927440	3929800	that he's laying out seem,
3929800	3932760	something seems true about them.
3932760	3937280	And so because of that,
3937280	3941440	and because he doesn't really talk about meaning in life,
3941440	3945560	I thought his framework would be a really great framework
3945560	3949000	to take over and to try to talk about meaning
3949000	3951880	from within that existential framework
3953320	3955000	because it is phenomenological.
3955000	3957960	It is an experiential sort of phenomenon, meaning is.
3959200	3960360	And so almost,
3963560	3966600	I guess taking what Heidegger has done
3966600	3968400	and adding something to it,
3968400	3972440	it's kind of what in a sense I'm doing.
3972440	3973480	Yeah.
3973480	3974840	Yeah, like all great thinkers, isn't it?
3974840	3976320	Because Heidegger himself,
3976320	3978960	even though he was trying to subvert whole of philosophy,
3978960	3981320	he still was working off,
3981320	3987640	like Aristotle or Kant or some great thinkers of the past.
3987640	3989840	Okay, so this,
3989840	3994160	I want to read out an excerpt from your essay.
3994160	3995880	The reason being,
3995880	3999520	I think the way you've put it here very much pertains to,
3999520	4002520	so firstly, this is a small statement you've made
4002520	4004960	in regarding apropos time
4004960	4008440	and you've discussed how time would differ
4008520	4013080	for a phenomenologist from, let's say, a scientist.
4013080	4014680	And then you put and you've written
4014680	4019680	and you've quoted Heidegger in that statement you've made.
4020280	4022080	And I think that statement itself
4022080	4025040	is more of like a sobered example as to,
4025040	4027240	it probably answers a lot of questions
4027240	4029400	that we were discussing, for example,
4029400	4032120	the difference between phenomenology and science
4032120	4035240	or if there is this stark difference
4035240	4038160	and then how that relates to meaning and whatnot.
4038160	4041040	So firstly, I'll read out the statement
4041040	4042680	and then I'll ask the question.
4042680	4045560	So here's what you've stated, Jacob.
4045560	4046920	For Martin Heidegger,
4046920	4051440	past events are always projected into the future,
4051440	4055480	while also existing presently as having been.
4056680	4060160	The future is not later than having been
4060160	4063080	and having been is not earlier than the present.
4064080	4068280	What was having been arises simultaneously
4068280	4070600	with the present and the future
4070600	4073920	and human being is always towards,
4073920	4078240	toward itself in anticipation of the possible ways of being.
4079800	4082240	The Heideggerian concept of time
4082240	4085120	frees the phenomenologists from thinking
4085120	4087200	of past, present and future
4087200	4091400	as sequentially ordered groupings of distinct events.
4091480	4096240	So saying that, how does a phenomenologist
4096240	4099960	or a Heideggerian view time and meaning
4099960	4103040	and how that pertains to a human being
4103040	4107160	from let's say an analytical philosopher or a scientist?
4110240	4113960	So a common theme in Heidegger
4113960	4118960	is this idea of primordial phenomenon and deriving.
4119200	4123040	You may have to explain that term, primordial phenomenon.
4124200	4126760	So basically, what he means by that is
4128080	4133080	the more basic, more fundamental structure,
4134360	4136720	I guess, what you could say.
4136720	4139560	And because it's a phenomenological structure,
4139560	4142000	it's gonna be an experiential thing.
4142000	4143920	And Heidegger thinks that a lot of the things
4143920	4147080	that we have theories for now,
4147080	4150400	were derived from something more basic
4150400	4152640	that we had an experience.
4153920	4156800	And time is one of them.
4156800	4161800	And so like the sort of everyday notion of time that we have,
4162840	4166400	which I think at the end of that paragraph
4166400	4168560	that you read, kind of talked about it
4168560	4173560	as far as like the sequentially ordered groupings of events.
4173600	4177060	So the idea that there's a future moment,
4177580	4179340	that's coming into the present
4179340	4183140	and then it's going to vanish into the past
4183140	4184740	and be gone forever.
4184740	4188300	So that's sort of everyday thinking about time and clock time.
4188300	4192260	Heidegger's gonna refer to as bolder time.
4192260	4195660	It's a derived mode of time.
4195660	4198420	It's not the primordial phenomenon of time.
4200100	4205100	And so he's gonna talk about this more basic idea of time.
4206100	4208540	And he's gonna call it temporality talk.
4208540	4212020	If I say time, think about, let's think about
4212020	4213260	our everyday understanding of time.
4213260	4217260	And if I say, we can't think about Heidegger's idea of time,
4217260	4220360	it might just be easier for a sake of conversation.
4221820	4226820	So temporality is obviously very important.
4228700	4230860	He wrote a book called being and time.
4231860	4235620	And so the second division of being and time
4235620	4237700	really dives into the details of that.
4237700	4240380	I'm not going to sit here and pretend that I could,
4240380	4243500	that I know the exact meaning that Heidegger meant
4243500	4246420	with his concept of time or temporality
4246420	4248300	because it's very complex, very difficult.
4248300	4252380	But what I can say is that the basic structure,
4252380	4254980	the basic operator structures that he lays out
4254980	4256660	in his existential analysis,
4257660	4261660	each pertain to a specific aspect of temporality.
4263860	4268860	So we have understanding as a a priori structure
4273060	4276780	along with attunement, which I talked about a few moments
4276780	4278020	a few minutes ago.
4279060	4283820	And he also has fallenness or discourse.
4283820	4288340	And basically what Heidegger says
4288340	4290940	is that those three things come together
4290940	4295940	to form the structure of disclosiveness,
4296740	4300180	the way we disclose the world in a basic way.
4302260	4305140	And each one of those pertains to a certain aspect of time.
4305140	4309140	And so we have, we're kind of thrown in the world,
4309140	4311140	we kind of find ourselves in the world
4312140	4317300	and we have a past that we didn't really choose for ourselves.
4317300	4322300	And we have the way we find ourselves in the world
4324420	4327620	within the Skype or attunement,
4327620	4329020	kind of the way we're currently attuned
4329020	4330740	and dealing with the world.
4330740	4334340	And that's kind of going to point toward the present
4334340	4337220	and then understanding is pointing towards the future
4337380	4341460	because understanding, and this is not going to be,
4342660	4344460	it's not a cognitive thing.
4344460	4346180	I mean, Heidegger will say that because
4348180	4350460	theories of cognition are going to come after this.
4350460	4352940	So again, we're talking about the a priori structures
4352940	4355380	that are required for you to be able to make up
4355380	4356620	a theory of cognition.
4356620	4358220	And so he doesn't want to,
4358220	4360180	he doesn't want people to conflate
4360180	4361500	what you mean by understanding.
4361500	4364180	And he gives very specific definitions to all of his terms
4364180	4365500	and sometimes it's confusing
4365500	4368260	because we all think we know what we mean by understanding.
4368260	4369740	So if I could use that.
4369740	4374740	But through the structure and through understanding,
4375940	4380500	we find ourselves amongst a whole lot of possibilities
4380500	4382300	and we're constantly projecting ourselves
4382300	4383860	toward those possibilities,
4383860	4384900	whether we know it or not,
4384900	4386820	whether we're aware of it or not.
4387820	4391980	And it could be mundane things such as,
4391980	4395340	if I stand up right now and I go to walk
4396180	4397340	to fill my water,
4399220	4400500	I'm going to be using the door handle
4400500	4403900	and I'm going to be doing a whole lot of things
4403900	4406380	that I'm not really thinking about doing.
4406380	4410580	But those are all possible modes of comportment,
4410580	4413100	possible ways that I can comport myself right now.
4416420	4419100	So I'm constantly projecting myself into the future.
4419100	4423020	Now to give like, to try to give a better example
4424020	4426580	of these three modes come together.
4428060	4430420	Maybe we could talk about the harvest.
4430420	4431420	Yeah, I was just going to ask.
4431420	4433260	So the three modes, okay.
4433260	4437660	Let's, how about we try to use the example of the artist
4437660	4441460	to expound on what temporality is
4441460	4444260	and expound on what hiding means by time.
4444260	4446460	But then maybe break down,
4446460	4448460	break down those three modes.
4449420	4451840	Apropos the example of the artist.
4453220	4458220	So let's just assume that we're talking about
4462940	4464780	I'll call them a master artist,
4464780	4469780	somebody that's practiced for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years,
4470460	4472460	something they've been doing their whole life.
4476140	4478620	They've built up certain habits, right?
4478620	4480380	I mean, you don't get good at something,
4480380	4481900	you don't learn how to paint,
4481900	4483380	you don't paint your master,
4483380	4488380	first time you spent decades of time practicing,
4488580	4491180	making mistakes, and so on.
4493300	4496300	During the time that you're practicing something
4496300	4498140	and you're trying to master something,
4500220	4505020	you're doing that, I mean, so let's say you're,
4505020	4506220	somebody's practicing right now,
4506220	4510620	they're practicing their skill in some art painting.
4512900	4515300	And in a very real sense,
4516940	4519220	the future is co-arising.
4520540	4523100	And the way in which it's co-arising is
4527060	4530980	they are cultivating an ability to do something.
4530980	4534980	They're expanding the horizon of possibilities
4536180	4538260	that they can project themselves upon.
4538260	4542660	So through the present moment, the future is co-arising.
4542660	4545180	And let's say after they moved in,
4545180	4550180	they practiced, now they're the master painter
4550180	4552660	and they're creating a masterpiece.
4552660	4557260	In a very real way, their past is co-arising with them
4557260	4562260	at that moment in the sense that they have these techniques
4562260	4567260	and they have a habitual way in which they use a brush
4568180	4570220	to stroke the canvas.
4570220	4574780	And they wouldn't have that without their past
4574780	4576140	practice and discipline.
4577020	4580180	And so the past is with them at every moment,
4580180	4584460	that's with us at every moment, in the present moment.
4584460	4587660	And then their future continues to co-arise
4587660	4590980	because they're one brush stroke, two brush strokes,
4590980	4593540	it's not their masterpiece yet,
4593540	4597180	but in the process, the future,
4597180	4599980	which will be their masterpiece is co-arising,
4599980	4603700	being made possible through what they're doing right now
4603700	4607300	and what they're doing right now was only made possible
4607300	4610980	because of the past, which I'm saying the past,
4610980	4613500	but I'm also saying it's still with them
4613500	4615780	because it must be or else they wouldn't be a master.
4615780	4619220	You can't be a master at something unless you have
4619220	4620900	gathered up with you,
4621900	4624820	years and years of practice.
4624820	4627740	You're bringing all of this together
4627740	4629580	in the present moment in this one.
4631020	4633620	Which is why you say that it's not,
4633620	4635860	in fact, let me read out a small excerpt here.
4635860	4639420	You say that, during meaningful experience,
4639420	4643380	this Hedigerian temporality displaces
4643380	4646180	the vulgar understanding of time
4646180	4648620	for the latter loses its significance
4648620	4652780	when human being is immersed in the world
4652780	4656500	through passionate, skilled and creative activity
4656500	4658540	or during being with others.
4658540	4663140	So the point is, to put it very, very colloquially,
4663140	4666380	you say, I'm in love with a beautiful woman
4666380	4670020	or when I'm in this, let's say, flow state or whatever,
4670020	4672780	you lose track of time.
4672780	4677420	I don't know where time goes and this is the kind of time
4677420	4679860	that you're saying Hediger is talking about,
4679860	4683860	not time in a linear sense where it's t equals zero
4683860	4685740	and then it goes on from there.
4685740	4689020	And it's hard for us because what's interesting
4689020	4691740	about what I realized about Hediger is that
4691740	4694220	once you get it, you get it.
4694220	4695860	You're like, oh, it's obvious what he's talking about
4695860	4698180	because it's a part of our experience, isn't it?
4698180	4702340	But getting it is a hard part because we are so,
4702340	4705420	we are so trained or we're so,
4706420	4709420	let's say attuned to thinking a different way.
4709420	4711980	So, hmm.
4711980	4715420	Yeah, I think that's the beautiful thing
4715420	4720420	about good phenomenology is that when you get it,
4721060	4723260	you get it in a different way than you get
4725740	4727980	a proposition that you're struggling with.
4727980	4730980	Maybe you're struggling with this analytic proposition
4730980	4733780	or this argument and eventually maybe you work it off,
4733780	4734900	you get it, you understand it
4735100	4737180	and you're like, okay, cool, I get it.
4737180	4738700	But with phenomenology, I mean,
4738700	4740460	a lot of times you do have to struggle with it.
4740460	4742820	You have to struggle with Hediger.
4742820	4744660	I struggled with him for a very, very long time
4744660	4746060	before I understood anything.
4747460	4750380	But once you get it, like you said,
4750380	4752540	because it is a part of our experience,
4754140	4758340	you're not just affected cognitively or intellectually
4758340	4762700	by the understanding because it's deeper than that,
4762700	4764820	the understanding, I mean, it feeds back
4764820	4767540	into Hediger's basic structure that he's talking about.
4767540	4769580	I mean, you feel it, you feel attuned to it.
4769580	4772860	You say, oh my goodness, like I can see this in my experience.
4772860	4774940	You know, like how did I not notice this before?
4774940	4776900	Because again, he's pointing,
4776900	4778620	he's trying to point to things in experience
4778620	4781140	and there's something very powerful about that,
4781140	4783580	in my opinion, over and above something
4783580	4785620	that's just propositional that you can't experience
4785620	4788380	for yourself or you can't notice or reflect on
4788380	4791220	and say, yes, that is a part of the experience.
4791220	4795420	And it's not surprising that the existentialist,
4795420	4798580	Sartre, Dibabua, Kamu,
4798580	4801380	were all heavily influenced by Hediger
4801380	4803940	because they were, that was the question
4803940	4805580	they too were trying to deal with,
4805580	4807980	the philosophy they were trying to develop,
4807980	4812180	was it was, well, the word itself is existential.
4812180	4814780	There probably isn't any other word to describe it.
4816100	4818300	Fantastic, that was a great explanation,
4818300	4822700	especially the, I like the analogy of the artist.
4822700	4826660	In fact, all great, great Hedigerian teachers
4826660	4828340	or teachers who do teach Hediger,
4828340	4830660	they, like the person that comes from my mind
4830660	4834900	is one of my intellectual heroes, Hubert Dreyfus.
4834900	4837340	It's how beautifully he,
4837340	4839260	he first of all, he's thinking live,
4839260	4840660	he's thinking out loud,
4840660	4843820	but also he always tries to connect it to a phenomena,
4843820	4845260	to a phenomenon,
4845300	4848620	something that's palpable in our lives.
4850980	4852420	How are we going with time, Jacob?
4852420	4855100	We're about an hour, 20 minutes
4855100	4858100	into the podcast, into the episode.
4858100	4859300	Can we do a few more minutes?
4859300	4861540	So how are you going with time?
4861540	4863180	I'm good on time.
4864660	4866580	Either talking to you today
4866580	4871220	or I'm reading and working on the dissertation.
4871220	4874820	So I have, as long as you are.
4874820	4876220	Perfect, I appreciate that, man.
4876220	4877780	I mean, look, I was thinking,
4879340	4881380	as we did discuss before we started recording,
4881380	4883580	I don't think we can go to all the questions,
4883580	4884740	everything you've written,
4884740	4888780	especially probably the paper I like the most by you,
4888780	4892780	the reinstatement of existential meaning
4892780	4896940	or passion as a disclosure of meaningfulness in life.
4896940	4898420	That seems a very,
4900220	4903380	perhaps a very contemporary topic to even talk about
4903380	4905740	because passion seems to be something we talk about a lot
4905740	4907860	in our culture these days.
4907860	4909340	It'd be interesting to think of that
4909340	4910420	in a phenomenological approach.
4910420	4911620	However, saying all that,
4911620	4914380	I would probably leave that to a whole other episode.
4914380	4916900	So let's get to the one that you said
4916900	4918620	is a good starting point to your work,
4918620	4920980	which is your paper,
4920980	4922460	Ontology of Meaning.
4923540	4927740	So a lot of questions that I've written down on this.
4928940	4930620	We touched on a lot of things.
4930620	4932820	We spoke about phenomenology for sure.
4935820	4937660	How about we talk about something a bit interesting?
4937660	4941460	Firstly, like we did with the previous paper,
4941460	4943860	let's just get what you were trying to convey in the paper.
4943860	4946260	So what did you mean by Ontology of Meaning?
4946260	4949180	And after that, I want to talk about authenticity
4949180	4951660	because it seems like this idea of,
4951660	4954020	just like there's this cliche corporate words
4954020	4956060	like bring your authentic self to work
4956060	4957700	or be authentic online.
4958260	4961780	And it's perhaps worth diving into what is authenticity
4961780	4965820	from more of an existential phenomenological approach.
4965820	4967460	But sorry, I'm getting carried away here.
4967460	4968980	Before we get there,
4968980	4971340	your paper, Ontology of Meaning,
4972420	4973700	what's the paper about?
4973700	4975620	What were you trying to convey?
4975620	4976860	And also if you could please,
4976860	4978460	where can people find the paper,
4978460	4979980	either now or in the future?
4980900	4983900	Sure, so that paper will be available
4984900	4988020	in the first quarter of 2023.
4988020	4991940	That's what I was told the anticipated publication date is.
4993020	4996940	Basically, they just have to do some formatting
4996940	5000700	and just wait for the next issue to be published
5000700	5001700	and it should be out there
5001700	5004260	at the Conan Tuss Journal of Philosophy.
5006700	5011700	So in that paper, it's very apparent.
5012580	5014220	I think, is it in the title, Ontology of Meaning?
5014220	5015460	I've written that paper so long
5015460	5017380	that I sometimes I forget what the heck I...
5017380	5020980	I think, because the paper,
5020980	5023420	the paper, in fact,
5023420	5025220	I made a mistake when I read out the title.
5025220	5027980	The name of the file was Ontology of Meaning.
5027980	5031100	However, the title of the paper itself
5031100	5034460	is Reinstatement of Essential Meaning.
5035460	5036380	Yes, okay.
5036380	5038140	So it was originally going to be named
5038580	5041220	something about Ontology of Meaning.
5043220	5048220	I was actually playing more into the philosophical tradition
5048540	5049540	and I wanted with that
5049540	5052220	with when I was starting the kid's day.
5052220	5053780	And by that, I just mean,
5053780	5057260	so kind of the traditional idea of Ontology
5057260	5058340	is going to be very different
5058340	5060260	than high-figures kinds of Ontology.
5063460	5067300	And I won't go into the details of it too much,
5067300	5071340	but generally in traditional philosophy,
5071340	5073100	Ontology is almost like,
5073100	5076020	you can almost take like an inventory of the world.
5076020	5077740	So you have one category,
5079180	5080540	broad category, Metaphysics.
5081740	5082980	And then a step up from that,
5082980	5084340	maybe you have Ontology,
5084340	5085700	depending on how you want to define it.
5085700	5087500	Everybody kind of seems to play with it
5087500	5088740	a little bit differently.
5093540	5095380	And in any case,
5095380	5096500	I'll just move on because I guess,
5096500	5099300	I fixed the title right before I submitted it
5099300	5101300	because I was like, man, I don't want,
5102900	5104460	you know, you start to notice your own mistakes
5104460	5106940	sometimes as they're happening.
5106940	5109140	So you're saying that you don't prefer
5109140	5110500	using the term Ontology
5110500	5114180	because you don't want to mislead the reader
5114180	5116540	as to what high-figure means by Ontology.
5116540	5119940	Is that why you wanted to change the name of the paper?
5119940	5123100	Yeah, that's ultimately why I did end up changing.
5123100	5125540	Well, and also because I was kind of thinking about it
5125540	5126900	in a more traditional sense,
5126900	5131100	almost like meaning was a specific type of thing,
5131100	5133420	but it's not a thing, like meaning is not a thing.
5133420	5134700	Absolutely.
5134700	5136900	Giving that, I was kind of implying that
5136900	5140340	with the title, as far as the traditional
5140340	5141660	understanding of Ontology goes.
5141660	5145820	And I really did not want to give that impression
5145820	5150260	or implication that I was trying to call out meaning
5150260	5152420	as a thing or an entity.
5153420	5156940	Because I most certainly do not think that,
5156940	5160740	but in any case, then that paper, I was really trying
5165420	5168940	I was trying to get across
5170900	5175300	and how we might be able to begin thinking about meaning
5175300	5176580	and more importantly,
5177260	5180380	where we, well, I guess,
5180380	5182740	less about where we might experience it
5182740	5186740	and more about how we should be thinking
5186740	5191740	about meaning if we want to actually talk about it
5192180	5196020	in a genuine manner.
5196020	5198860	And I say this because, and I go,
5198860	5202740	I'm pretty sure that's the essay where I talk a bit
5202740	5205220	about science and talk a bit about logic
5206220	5209820	and I try to, I mean, it's really quick.
5209820	5211420	I didn't have a lot of space to do this,
5211420	5215220	but I try to point out the reasons why
5215220	5219100	are the wrong frameworks where we're trying to discover
5219100	5220740	meaning and talk about meaning.
5222340	5227340	And why I did this is specifically with scientism,
5229780	5232060	but with really any reductive,
5232060	5233980	any scientist that's reductive,
5233980	5238420	you have this idea that everything can be reduced
5238420	5239460	down to a certain thing.
5239460	5242740	So we can reduce things, a physical subject,
5242740	5246700	things that chemistry or we can reduce things to our biology.
5248860	5253860	And you pair that reductive approach with scientism
5257860	5260700	or the idea that we're,
5260780	5263860	and then just place in physics or chemistry or biology,
5266020	5270580	you're gonna, there's no word for meaning anymore
5270580	5274100	in that world, and meaning is considered non-existent.
5274100	5277300	It's considered unreal, it's considered at best an illusion
5278540	5282420	or some subjective manifestation made up by our minds
5282420	5286980	as opposed to a real phenomenon.
5286980	5291980	And so that paper was really trying to get that idea across
5293300	5296340	and to try to point to phenomenology
5296340	5300540	as a legitimate outside logic in science
5300540	5302100	for understanding the world.
5302100	5307100	And I argued for soul phenomenology,
5311100	5313220	like only phenomenology approach,
5313220	5316140	but phenomenology and other things
5316140	5318740	because if ultimately, I think,
5320260	5321860	a holistic approach is the best approach
5321860	5325020	if you want to understand as much as you can.
5325020	5328900	And so by placing phenomenology aside,
5328900	5331740	things like science and logic,
5333740	5336500	for as tools for understanding ourselves in the world
5336500	5341300	and reality and by saying ourselves world reality,
5341300	5342260	really just mean everything.
5342260	5346620	I just mean that everything, our experience,
5346620	5348540	the world, the cosmos, you know.
5348540	5349780	All of being.
5349780	5351140	Yeah, all of being.
5352620	5355140	This is, I'm glad we're talking about this.
5355140	5357500	Perhaps before we get to the, sorry, did I interrupt you,
5357500	5358340	Jacob?
5358340	5359300	I think you were not done.
5359300	5360140	Were you done?
5360140	5360980	No.
5360980	5361820	Apologies if I did.
5361820	5363940	Sometimes the connection, there's a bit of a lag.
5364940	5367100	Okay, so this is interesting because you've said here,
5367100	5368980	I wanted to ask from you,
5368980	5370540	and this is very, very important, I think,
5370540	5373980	because now, again, going back to a point I made before,
5373980	5378980	it seems like science has taken the place of philosophy.
5379980	5381740	And I think that's to our own peril.
5382780	5387060	And you've said here, science is reductive.
5387060	5390060	So it attempts to describe meaning, experience,
5390060	5394420	whatever in a reductive sense.
5394420	5399180	And then you've said it's trying to take a view from nowhere.
5399220	5401380	However, this got me thinking,
5401380	5403340	you made a really interesting point
5403340	5406540	in your previous article that we discussed.
5406540	5408260	And I'm going to read out an excerpt
5408260	5410060	where you've said it, you put it this way.
5410060	5413260	You've said, so this is, I propose this idea of science
5413260	5416620	trying to be objective and taking a view from nowhere.
5416620	5421620	You've commented on something by Ponty, by Molluponty,
5421900	5424780	where you put differently.
5424780	5427820	And as Maurice Molluponty made explicit
5427860	5431460	in his preface to Phenomenology of Perception,
5431460	5433460	this is really important what you've said here.
5434460	5437940	The third-person perspective of science
5437940	5442940	is only made possible through first-person human experience
5443060	5446860	because we only achieve a third-person perspective
5446860	5451340	via a collection of first-person human experiences.
5452460	5456500	The subjective first-person experience then
5456540	5460900	is something that is both pervasive and inescapable.
5460900	5463660	So this got me thinking,
5464540	5467180	is it even possible for science to ever be objective?
5467180	5470300	Can we have an objective science in the sense of,
5470300	5473140	can we truly, given that we are designed,
5473140	5476820	we are being in the world, have a view from nowhere?
5478220	5481220	Oh, no, I think it's a myth.
5481220	5484180	I think at best, we can have intersubjective knowledge.
5484180	5487260	And I think that's what most people,
5488740	5492020	not that they mean, not that they know that they mean this,
5492020	5493700	but when most people say objective knowledge,
5493700	5496340	what they're pointing to is intersubjective knowledge.
5496340	5498980	Because, yeah, I mean, I don't think there's any way
5498980	5502300	to get around what Molluponty pointed out
5502300	5504140	in the preface to his book.
5505020	5506140	There's no way of getting out of it.
5506140	5507700	There's no way of getting around it.
5509820	5510660	That's all we have.
5510660	5512100	And so, if we're gonna collect up
5512100	5514260	a bunch of subjective experiences
5516100	5518980	and call them objective,
5518980	5521780	what we're really pointing to is intersubjectivity.
5523140	5527580	So a scientist would probably try to challenge you
5527580	5530100	on that point, on account of that point, saying that,
5530100	5531700	oh, no, in the scientific approach,
5531700	5533620	we have the double-blind study,
5533620	5536900	or we have rigorous empirical research,
5536900	5540460	where when you present a paper,
5540500	5542540	or when you have a hypothesis,
5542540	5545260	it's picked on by many other individuals,
5545260	5548100	many other, well, not individuals, let's say experts,
5548100	5551540	in that field who try and break down your arguments,
5551540	5555300	break down what one has asserted.
5555300	5558740	And then why are this excavation,
5558740	5563740	why are this breaking down or destructuring of a hypothesis,
5564940	5569940	if that proves the falsity or the truthfulness
5570260	5573260	of a certain hypothesis?
5573260	5575700	And as scientists would try to counter you saying that,
5575700	5578100	eventually, as we keep doing this,
5578100	5583100	we get to this to put it plainly, view from nowhere
5584620	5586260	or an objective approach.
5586260	5588180	So how would you respond to that?
5591620	5596620	I would, I guess I would respond by asking maybe some,
5599940	5604140	a little bit of information about each of the experts
5604140	5608460	in the field that was trying to check over the work
5608460	5612060	and see if it works or not.
5612940	5615260	Because I think by doing that,
5615260	5619220	very quickly you get to the idea that another person,
5619220	5623300	this is another dozen that has a perspective on the world.
5623300	5627940	And so we're collecting his perspective and this,
5627940	5631100	and we're collecting the next expert's perspective on this.
5631100	5636100	And I guess I would conclude by asking where it is,
5636940	5641940	because if there is a view, it's a view from somewhere.
5643060	5645340	A view implies work.
5645340	5647580	You can't view something without a viewer.
5649540	5653020	To have a perception there must be something perceiving.
5653020	5655700	And so I think to further imply perspectives.
5656540	5661540	And so I think it's not, I mean, I'm just objectivity.
5664660	5666140	I know some people are opposed here
5666140	5667420	and they want something more objective,
5667420	5672420	but I just, there's no reason to believe
5672820	5675460	that there's anything as such,
5675460	5678180	because everybody who has ever said that
5678180	5682220	is saying that from their given perspective.
5682220	5684780	And so it's almost like a performative contradiction
5684780	5686860	in a sense, like if you're going to argue for a view
5686860	5690420	from, you can't actually show the view from nowhere.
5690420	5695420	And if you, to have a view is to experience some things,
5698900	5703900	to be an experiencer, then I think it's just,
5704460	5709460	you get, and so I guess, yeah,
5709780	5713380	I guess that's, I would just try to respond in that way.
5713380	5716900	And then if they can back and push back them.
5716900	5718460	I'm not much of an arguer.
5718460	5720900	I don't like arguments and things.
5720900	5723540	A fair enough, but I tend to be quite,
5723540	5725260	you and I probably are a bit different on that
5725260	5728580	because I tend to be quite confrontational with these things.
5730780	5732900	Yeah, because it is interesting
5732900	5737540	because I even at like leaving maybe at a bit of a higher,
5737540	5740780	more like a cultural level, we have a lot of these things,
5740780	5744700	you know, even in politics or whatever people say,
5744700	5748780	I speak the truth, unbiased facts.
5748780	5752940	I throw facts at you or what's this by the Ben Shapiro guy,
5752940	5754620	facts don't care about your feelings,
5754620	5756260	all these such things.
5756260	5759820	But it seems like people don't even question the words
5759820	5761540	they use as in, what do you mean by facts?
5761540	5762820	What do you mean by truth?
5764980	5768140	And it even gets the idea of, you know,
5768140	5772220	what can't try to describe in his critic of pure reason,
5772220	5774860	there's pneumonia and phenomena.
5774860	5779860	And there are certain things that we can never experience.
5780940	5784820	They are more like upper right concepts.
5784820	5789820	And it does, but then, I don't know,
5790060	5791940	but then I wonder if like a Heidi Gehran would ask,
5791940	5795060	oh, in fact, no, the pneumonia itself doesn't exist
5795060	5799980	without someone being able to view it or perceive it.
5802700	5805700	Yeah, so that's a good question.
5805700	5809500	Yeah, I think, so for Heidi Gehran,
5809500	5811540	there's no two-world model.
5811540	5816100	I guess I always refer to like some distinction there,
5816100	5817700	two-world model, because you have like,
5817700	5820540	yeah, things and they appear a certain way,
5820540	5822580	but then you also have these things behind them
5822580	5824540	and that's like something else.
5824540	5825900	And you can't get to that.
5825900	5826740	You can't get to that.
5826740	5829340	So I refer to it as two-world model
5829340	5831300	because you have the appearance that you can get to
5831300	5834100	and you have this hidden world that you can't get to.
5835860	5836700	Yeah.
5836700	5838300	And Heidi Gehran has the single-world model.
5839460	5842540	Yeah, he was very much opposed to the Cartesian approach
5842540	5843860	in that sense, wasn't it?
5845980	5848260	Okay, here's an interesting one.
5848260	5850220	You've spoken about authenticity
5850220	5852340	in your paper, Ontology of Meaning,
5852340	5853660	oh, sorry, not Ontology of Meaning,
5853660	5855780	you've spoken about authenticity.
5855780	5858380	You've spoken about authenticity in the paper,
5858380	5862060	the re-instatement of Existential Meaning.
5862060	5863860	I know I read that out a couple of the times,
5863860	5868420	it's just to clarify what we're referring to.
5868420	5870380	So when it comes to the topic of authenticity,
5870380	5872700	it's something we hear very much in,
5872700	5873660	it's quite pervasive.
5873660	5878180	We hear it quite a lot in the contemporary online conversations.
5878180	5880380	As I said, a lot of corporations talk about
5880380	5882980	bring your authentic self to work.
5882980	5886060	For a Heidi Gehran or a phenomenologist,
5886940	5889220	what is authenticity?
5889220	5891060	And perhaps more importantly,
5891060	5894100	how is there a distinction between,
5894100	5897380	let's say Saad's view of authenticity
5897380	5899100	to what Heidi Gehran talks about?
5900180	5902620	That is if there is a difference at all.
5904580	5909580	So Heidi Gehran's understanding of authenticity
5910580	5915580	is going to be related to, we talk very minimally,
5916460	5921460	but I guess maybe we talked about possibilities
5922060	5925260	and we're always projecting ourselves on possibilities.
5925260	5927340	And so Heidi Gehran thinks that,
5929100	5932540	okay, so let's talk about authenticity first,
5932540	5935220	because it'll be easier to get to authenticity
5935220	5937700	because Heidi Gehran thinks that we're all,
5938700	5943700	all of us are most of the time living
5943700	5945380	in an inauthentic manner.
5946260	5948980	Now, Heidi Gehran doesn't place any judgment
5948980	5950860	on authenticity or inauthenticity.
5950860	5952980	He's just kind of saying like,
5952980	5956180	this is the way I'm describing things
5956180	5960260	from this phenomenological approach.
5960260	5963900	So he's not saying that one's good or bad necessarily,
5963900	5966180	but of course we all have connotations
5966260	5967660	associated with those terms.
5969460	5972980	So by living inauthentically,
5972980	5974540	basically what Heidi Gehran's talking about
5974540	5979540	is where we're in a fallen mode of being.
5979740	5981820	And that's always a possibility for us.
5982980	5987500	And really what that just means is we're absorbed
5987500	5992500	in Das Man, which can be translated as the anyone
5993460	5994500	or the they.
5995060	5998500	And that's just, it could be anyone.
5998500	5999580	It's kind of like group thought.
5999580	6001140	You can think about it as like group thought
6001140	6003700	or group thinking is kind of the way.
6005260	6008140	So if you come across phrases like,
6009340	6013700	this is what one does in this formal setting.
6013700	6016740	Like that's another, if you hear that,
6016740	6017980	everybody comes into that at some point
6017980	6021060	where they're going to school or you're going to a restaurant.
6021060	6022460	There's like, you behave in certain ways
6022460	6024420	and you don't behave in other ways.
6024500	6028740	And most of the time, I mean, a lot of times that's good.
6028740	6032620	I mean, we have to have these cultural structures in place
6032620	6034660	or else things would just be chaotic and hectic
6034660	6037340	and nobody would get along at all.
6037340	6039700	And everything would be in this.
6039700	6043100	So it's a lot of the time, it's not bad to be inauthentic.
6045460	6050020	But if you're just always inauthentic,
6050020	6052980	then what you do and the possibilities
6053020	6054460	that you project yourself upon
6054460	6057780	and the understanding that you have of yourself in the world
6057780	6062780	is given over to you from the day, from the group thought.
6063580	6066740	You're not taking anything up as your own.
6066740	6071740	You're not reflecting on things from your own experience.
6071900	6074620	You're accepting what they say
6074620	6076260	and you're doing as they do.
6076260	6078220	And if you're doing as they do
6078220	6080020	and you're accepting what they say,
6081020	6084220	that's why it's called sometimes translated as the anyone
6084220	6086620	because it could be anyone, you could be anyone.
6086620	6088540	I mean, you are anyone at that point.
6088540	6091860	There's really no individuation between you and someone else
6091860	6096860	if you're both functioning in that sort of mode all the time.
6099820	6103260	And so that's just, I guess, a very crude way
6103260	6105580	to describe inauthenticity.
6105580	6110580	And so to project yourself authentically
6113500	6118100	to, I guess, even become aware of your authentic possibilities,
6120100	6123300	you have to, in a sense, distance yourself
6123300	6127180	from the world of the day, from the anyone.
6128060	6131460	You have to sort of quiet the group thought
6131460	6132540	in the group chatter.
6132620	6139620	And High Digger says that, he says one way of doing that is by,
6142020	6144580	is through, I mean, actually it's,
6144580	6148820	so this is where his concept of angst and anxiety comes into play
6148820	6153820	because he says during these experiences of intense angst
6155300	6160300	and anxiety, you almost come into contact
6163180	6166020	with and experience nothingness in a sense.
6167180	6170220	And this is more akin to, I think,
6170220	6174140	what maybe what we would call it in contemporary,
6174140	6176860	like severe depression rather than just anxiety.
6179020	6181460	And so if you think about the severely depressed,
6183700	6186220	they're almost, in a sense, living in a different world
6186220	6190900	in the sense that they're not making connections
6190900	6195380	in practical references as they would in their everyday life.
6195380	6198620	Like things don't necessarily, things kind of like start,
6198620	6200300	they begin to fail to make sense.
6200300	6204180	And it's difficult for you to do very basic,
6204180	6206980	practical everyday things if you're severely depressed.
6206980	6209380	And somebody, anybody who's had these experiences
6209380	6210900	can probably relate.
6210900	6213340	I've had these experiences throughout my life.
6214980	6218460	And the reason why this is,
6219380	6223860	why this might get you toward authenticity is because
6223860	6228860	during those experiences, the world is quiet
6230580	6234500	in the sense that you're not just running from one thing
6234500	6236580	into the next, into the next, into the next
6236580	6239620	as the public interpretation would happen.
6239620	6241540	Or you're not just doing as one does,
6241540	6244380	you're probably just sitting in a room by yourself
6244380	6246580	and not knowing what to do or what to think.
6249100	6253340	And so that's one way that Heidegger will say,
6253340	6257060	you can distance yourself from public opinion
6257060	6260860	and public chatter and public interpretation
6260860	6264180	and understanding if you experience this.
6264180	6269180	And I guess on the other, the next step of that is
6269780	6273900	realizing or coming to terms with your own death.
6274900	6278500	And kind of reflecting upon your own death.
6278500	6283500	Because Heidegger says that that's the only truly,
6287100	6292100	that's the only truly self-owned possibility
6293340	6295540	in the sense that it's your possibility
6296540	6299460	and it's no one else, it's nobody can die for you.
6299460	6301380	I mean, if they die, you don't die.
6301380	6303180	So they're technically not dying for you.
6303700	6305220	Nobody can take over your death.
6305220	6308660	When you die, if you were, you have to die the death
6308660	6310500	or you're not dead.
6310500	6312700	And Heidegger talks about this as the,
6312700	6314900	he talks about death as the impossibility
6314900	6319380	or the possibility of the impossibility of existence.
6319380	6320500	Again, because he's staying true
6320500	6321820	to the phenomenological method.
6321820	6326340	So the possibility of the impossibility of existence.
6326340	6328180	Because Heidegger is not gonna say
6328180	6329420	what he thinks happens after death
6329420	6331020	because he hasn't experienced it
6331020	6333160	and it's not a phenomenological,
6333160	6334440	it's not a thing to talk about.
6334440	6338400	And so he says that it's possible that when we die,
6339720	6341080	maybe we won't exist.
6341080	6343240	And that's kind of where he leaves it.
6343240	6345000	But by coming to terms with this
6345000	6346240	and the way that Heidegger describes,
6346240	6350680	which is essentially, it's my death and it's my own
6350680	6352400	and it's nobody else's death.
6352400	6357400	That's the first glimpse of what he's going to say,
6358520	6360640	what he's gonna term authenticity
6360640	6364160	because it's my own possibility.
6364160	6367160	Okay, well, this is my own possibility.
6367160	6369880	Maybe I have other possibilities that are my own,
6369880	6372000	not anybody else's.
6372000	6374600	Maybe what might those possibilities be?
6374600	6377920	And then maybe you can start to think about
6379080	6380760	how you want to live your life
6380760	6385320	rather than how they want you to live your life.
6385320	6389720	And you can begin to construct an existence,
6389720	6392000	the way that you would like,
6392000	6394000	as opposed to the way that they would like.
6395400	6396880	And through doing that,
6396880	6400760	you begin to reveal authentic possibilities for yourself.
6400760	6402160	They can project yourself upon,
6402160	6404840	whether it's taking up a certain discipline
6404840	6407720	or for me, it was doing philosophy.
6407720	6412720	I actually started my formal education in a different field
6413920	6416480	and really looked philosophy,
6416480	6418720	but everybody said that's what I should not be doing
6419080	6421680	in a formal setting.
6421680	6424280	I should get educated so I can make money.
6424280	6426760	And so, and I did listen to what they said
6426760	6428880	for a very long time and then eventually I said,
6428880	6431200	you know what, I'm just gonna do this.
6431200	6432400	I can't stop reading this.
6432400	6434040	I can't stop thinking about this.
6434040	6436040	I'm obsessed with philosophy.
6436040	6439800	I don't know if I can force myself to go to school
6439800	6441800	for anything else, so I'm just gonna do it.
6442800	6447280	And so, I guess I like using that example
6447280	6449920	because it was very obvious to me
6449920	6454920	that I was being directed by popular opinion
6456960	6459600	and what they think I should be doing.
6459600	6463520	And then when I took over my existence as my own
6463520	6466120	and whatnot, then I started to
6466120	6469960	reveal these authentic possibilities for my existence.
6471120	6474400	And so really what authenticity for Heidegger means
6474400	6477080	is importing yourself in a way
6477080	6482000	that is unique to your own existence
6482000	6486240	and in such a way that you've chosen those possibilities.
6486240	6487880	You've taken them over as you're on your take.
6487880	6489480	And so responsibility comes in here
6489480	6493640	because if you're just doing whatever you want on a whim,
6493640	6497320	that's not a very great way to live either.
6497320	6499080	You might think you're being authentic,
6499080	6500840	but you really don't have a self at that point.
6500840	6503200	I mean, you're not cultivating anything.
6505000	6506120	In any real sense.
6506120	6508840	And so maybe you're doing what you want to do,
6508840	6513840	but you're not manifesting an authentic self
6515120	6516560	in the way that Heidegger would say
6516560	6520880	that you need to if you're gonna be authentic.
6520880	6525880	However, does Heidegger place any moral judgments
6526120	6529160	on the concept of authenticity itself
6529160	6532360	for a design or a human being?
6532400	6534680	In contrast, let's say someone like Sarth,
6534680	6539560	who does seem to, he calls it bad faith to be inauthentic,
6539560	6542800	who does seem to play some kind of moral judgment
6542800	6545760	despite him not being a fan of moralism
6545760	6547800	into authentic experience.
6547800	6552800	And I guess I'm trying to ask is there even a difference
6553160	6554840	between Heidegger's version
6554840	6557040	and Sarth's version of authenticity?
6558160	6561440	I'm not incredibly familiar with Sarth's version.
6561440	6566080	I feel like if I don't want to say anything that,
6567720	6568600	yeah, I guess I just,
6568600	6571400	I guess I want to refrain from commenting
6571400	6573640	because I don't know enough to say
6573640	6577560	whether or not they could basically be considered the same.
6577560	6579560	The only thing that I will say is that,
6582600	6587600	I know Sarth did misinterpret Heidegger on a few things.
6587600	6589040	And one of those things was the way
6589040	6592760	in which Heidegger was using the term as essential.
6592760	6595880	And if we're talking about existential possibilities
6595880	6597920	and how important existential possibilities are
6597920	6600520	for Heidegger's idea of authenticity
6600520	6604080	and if Sarth did misinterpret Heidegger on that point,
6604080	6607960	then I would think there would be a difference
6607960	6610160	and maybe an important distinction
6610160	6612680	to make between the two concepts of authenticity,
6612680	6615480	but I don't know for certain.
6616480	6618480	But does Heidegger himself place
6618480	6622040	any kind of qualitative differences?
6622040	6623280	I don't want to use the word moral.
6623280	6624520	Let's say qualitative difference
6624520	6627560	between being authentic and inauthentic.
6629200	6632600	No, no, he doesn't.
6632600	6637640	And I think the reason is because we,
6640360	6645080	even if we're aware of our possibility
6645080	6649000	for authenticity and even if we're living an authentic life
6649000	6653080	most of the time, we're still participating
6653080	6658080	in cultural structures that would be considered inauthentics
6658760	6663760	by Heidegger's thought on pretty much an everyday basis.
6664440	6668760	And it's not a bad thing to be doing.
6668760	6670240	It's necessary.
6675080	6676880	We're taught when we're children
6676880	6679800	to look both ways when we cross the road.
6679800	6681840	What one does before they cross the road.
6681840	6683000	Yeah.
6683000	6685880	So even these very mundane things
6685880	6687600	that you wouldn't really think about
6687600	6691960	in this philosophical capacity would be lumped into this idea
6691960	6696960	of things, it's all term inauthenticity this way.
6697960	6702040	Things that we've taken over from history
6702040	6704560	and culture and society
6704560	6707960	as far as ways to act and ways to think about things.
6709280	6711200	And it's not a bad thing.
6711200	6714720	I mean, I don't, I think we should all still look both ways
6714720	6716320	before we cross the road.
6716320	6717160	Yeah.
6717160	6718560	That's what's prescribed.
6718560	6721320	Yeah, another great example of Hubert Raphis.
6721320	6723760	I believe it's Hubert Raphis, pretty sure it's him.
6723760	6728760	He uses on the phenomenon is when you get into an elevator
6729120	6731920	the distance you stand from other people
6731960	6734480	and he says that that can culturally differ in fact.
6734480	6736560	So when you get into an elevator
6736560	6739840	some people don't mind being a bit too close to each other
6739840	6742520	whereas perhaps in Western countries
6742520	6745160	we would prefer having a bit of space
6745160	6747240	and we wouldn't want to be too close to another person
6747240	6750000	whereas I remember growing up in Sri Lanka
6750000	6752120	if you even take public transport
6752120	6755680	the other guy is just breathing down your neck
6755680	6757280	right next to you.
6757280	6760800	You wouldn't even see that here in Australia for instance.
6760800	6763960	Yeah, and again, those just because we're a part
6763960	6767840	of certain kinds of cultural practices does not make,
6767840	6770120	that is yes, inauthentic, but I wouldn't,
6770120	6774360	how would I say that makes you a morally inferior person?
6774360	6776400	Well, he doesn't make moral claims for starters
6776400	6778880	but he wouldn't even try to place any kind of
6778880	6781000	qualitative judgment on it, isn't he?
6781920	6785000	Yeah, yeah, so sometimes there's,
6785000	6788680	I mean, the terms are so, they're translated
6788680	6791680	as authenticity and authenticity so much
6791680	6794000	that I think it would be difficult to get away
6794000	6796720	from that particular translation of them
6796720	6801720	but another possible translation of the term
6803080	6806680	that he uses in German for authenticity,
6806680	6810080	I mean, you could translate it as oneness or,
6810080	6815080	so it could be like something that you chose
6815480	6818960	like in a self-owned manner or something like that.
6818960	6822280	And so like inauthenticity, you know, might be just,
6822280	6827280	it's a thing that you're doing that you didn't really,
6828760	6832120	you weren't the original agent to prescribe that
6832120	6835560	or something, you know, I mean, it's kind of difficult
6835560	6837240	to talk about without just using the terms
6837240	6838760	that are always used in the translations
6838760	6843680	but I feel like in the original language,
6843680	6847000	it wouldn't have such heavy connotations as it does
6847000	6851280	in Western culture as far as like acting authentically
6851280	6852640	as something you must do all the time
6852640	6854440	and you must always avoid it.
6854440	6858360	Yeah, and the problem is again with authenticity
6858360	6860200	or even passion, which we can get to,
6860200	6862520	hopefully in the next conversation I check it,
6862520	6865360	is that it's a colloquialism, it's used
6865360	6869080	so it's pervasive colloquially and it comes
6869080	6873000	with a lot of baggage, so it's a bit hard to,
6873040	6875280	here's where I really wish that I learned,
6875280	6876440	I could speak German.
6877440	6878720	In fact, I'm trying to learn French
6878720	6880520	to read some of the French philosophers
6880520	6884400	but maybe one day in life, who knows, maybe even German.
6884400	6889480	Oh, yeah, mate, so look, that was fantastic.
6889480	6892200	I am really feeling refreshed
6892200	6894120	and I would even say to a certain extent,
6894120	6895840	I think I'm in the flow state right now,
6895840	6897800	so I'm just really, really feeling it.
6900080	6902960	I don't think we'll have time to go through all the paper
6902960	6906400	and in fact, just to give it the time that it deserves,
6906400	6910760	I wanna probably have a separate episode on that.
6912320	6914600	We're coming to the two-hour mark
6914600	6916720	or we've even crossed two hours now.
6916720	6919040	Maybe to kind of, as like a conclusive statement,
6919040	6921440	more of just practical advice.
6921440	6924360	As someone who studies philosophy, as a writer,
6925320	6928880	I would ask you a two-part question.
6928880	6931800	What advice would you have for people like myself,
6931800	6934240	in your fights, or even just people
6934240	6935720	trying to get into philosophy
6935720	6937880	on how to study philosophy?
6937880	6940440	And secondly, what advice would you have
6940440	6942760	on writing philosophy?
6945840	6948840	So as far as studying philosophy goes,
6950040	6952880	it's always a good idea to have an understanding
6952880	6956120	of the history of philosophy.
6956120	6960560	That way, you kind of, so getting an idea of the history,
6960760	6964840	if you reflect on that sort of study,
6964840	6969040	you start to come to certain realizations
6969040	6974040	as far as maybe how one idea inspired another idea.
6976520	6981520	And you also get an idea of what's been said already.
6982840	6985840	So, okay, so when you get into philosophy,
6985840	6987120	sometimes it happens where you think
6987120	6989120	you have a really cool novel idea
6989120	6990000	based on something you've read,
6990800	6993000	but then you realize that somebody else also said that
6993000	6994440	like a thousand years ago.
6994440	6997880	And so, the thing of the history is good for that reason too.
6997880	7001600	So you're not just spending time reiterating something
7001600	7004440	that somebody's already done a thousand or 2,000 years ago.
7005400	7010120	It also gives you an idea that nothing is absolute
7010120	7015120	in the sense that, I mean, you can see how much has changed
7015600	7019800	over the centuries of philosophical thought
7019800	7024800	and I think that's good for the ego,
7025040	7026840	just to get a given understanding
7026840	7030120	that they didn't have the absolute truth.
7030120	7031800	I'm not gonna get the absolute truth,
7031800	7033160	but we can think about these things
7033160	7036680	and still maybe discern partial truths
7036680	7038760	or something like that.
7039760	7041200	I always like to have that in mind
7041200	7043880	when I'm writing things or thinking about things.
7044880	7048400	So any more, like when it comes to your process
7048400	7051040	of reading, writing, what's the,
7051040	7053600	how does it look like on a day-to-day basis?
7054960	7059960	Consistency is, I think, what has helped me above all else.
7061440	7063120	Like just reading a little bit every day
7063120	7065280	or studying a little bit every day when you can't,
7065280	7066720	like even if it's 20 minutes.
7066720	7068240	So like the first thing,
7068240	7070040	a lot of times the first thing I do in the morning
7070680	7075680	is I listen to a lecture or I listen to part of an audio book
7076280	7080120	or a podcast, you know, where they're discussing certain things.
7081440	7083720	Because that just really gets my mind going right away
7083720	7085520	as far as thinking about these things.
7087120	7090440	And the reason why I choose, sometimes I'm too tired,
7090440	7091760	like for the first hour that I wake up
7091760	7093320	that I can't really force myself to read,
7093320	7095320	but I can listen to something.
7095320	7096760	I can get my coffee.
7096760	7098520	Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can,
7098520	7099960	I can listen and drink coffee.
7099960	7102200	It's hard for me to read and make my coffee.
7104320	7107480	So I think repetition or consistency
7107480	7110600	and just persevering, like you think you don't understand
7110600	7112920	some of the things, like don't just stop reading it,
7112920	7114080	just read it.
7114080	7115680	Even if you don't understand it, just read it
7115680	7119280	because you might start to understand
7119280	7122240	bits of it after you're finished.
7122240	7123520	And even if you don't,
7123520	7125800	things might start to make sense maybe months later
7125800	7127080	or something like that.
7127080	7129440	That's the experience I had with high degree in time.
7129440	7132120	I read it once and came away from it saying,
7132120	7135560	dude, I don't understand literally anything this guy said.
7137240	7139440	But I feel like there's something really important here.
7139440	7143600	And so I really dove into secondary sources and lectures
7143600	7146200	and going through the book multiple times after that.
7147400	7150960	And so I would say just read a little bit every day
7150960	7154520	and make notes right in the margins of your book.
7154520	7155760	If you have a physical book,
7155760	7158960	don't try to keep your book super perfect and neat.
7158960	7162840	Just start writing stuff down and highlighting stuff.
7162840	7165560	If you have a question about something you read
7165560	7167080	and it seems like it's a good question,
7167080	7169680	write the question next to the paragraph in the book.
7169680	7172440	I just doing small things like that
7172440	7174320	has helped me a whole lot.
7174320	7176600	Highlighting things you think are important.
7176600	7178120	And then highlighting things in a different color
7178120	7179840	that you just don't understand.
7179840	7181960	You know, because you can go back through
7182040	7186400	and you can, it has to be an active process, I guess.
7186400	7188640	Maybe that's what I'm trying to get around to.
7188640	7190640	It involves an active process.
7190640	7193360	You're not just sitting there and taking in words
7193360	7195440	that you're seeing with your eyes.
7195440	7198360	It's an involved process of writing
7198360	7200280	and thinking and reflecting.
7200280	7203760	And don't be concerned with reading too quickly
7203760	7206760	or saying, it's taking me forever to get to the 10 pages,
7206760	7210560	but it's gonna take me a year to read being in time.
7212160	7213520	Just give it the time.
7213520	7215800	It will be quicker and easier to read.
7215800	7218120	And I just like to take the approach
7218120	7219960	of giving things the time that they ask.
7219960	7222200	They're gonna ask you for a certain amount of time
7222200	7224320	and just give it to them.
7226560	7230200	So do you normally pick a thinker
7230200	7232720	and then study all of that thinker's work,
7232720	7236720	the whole over of the thinker's work?
7236720	7240440	Or do you rather pick, let's say,
7240440	7244320	a fundamental philosophical text
7244320	7247080	like it could be critique of pure reason
7247080	7250480	or some of Plato's Republic, whatever it may be,
7250480	7253320	and then focus on the text itself?
7253320	7255960	Or are you more thinker focused?
7259400	7264400	So really, I'm more thinker focused now
7265760	7269240	than I have ever been, but previous to this,
7269240	7274240	I almost always say I was thinking just broadly.
7274920	7277360	Let's just say I was thinking about topics
7277360	7278640	and philosophy of mine.
7281280	7286280	And maybe I got intrigued by physicalism.
7288000	7291680	Well, then I would go through and I would try to find
7291680	7293120	what the history of physicalism was
7293120	7298000	and what the major thinkers were in kind of read along
7298000	7302640	the concept or the theory from a variety of perspectives.
7302640	7305600	And then I really immerse myself in it
7305600	7309320	and try to think from that perspective.
7309320	7311560	And sometimes you do have to spend a lot of time
7311560	7314400	to get to the added areas
7314400	7317320	or to get attuned to that kind of motive thought
7317320	7320000	so that you have to spend more time.
7320000	7323960	But then after that, I would read the opposite view.
7323960	7326400	Whatever the opposite view was,
7326440	7328560	not necessarily just arguments against
7328560	7329800	whatever position it is,
7329800	7333880	but what's like a contrasting theory or idea.
7333880	7335000	And then I would dive into that.
7335000	7335840	And so I did that.
7335840	7340400	Honestly, that's what most of my undergrad time doing
7340400	7345400	was just like kind of juxtaposing theories and concepts
7345800	7347600	with contrasting theories.
7348560	7350440	And just trying to get a really holistic view
7350440	7352000	of like why people think things.
7352840	7356640	I don't have very strong opinions personally.
7357560	7360200	It's easier for me to do that sort of study.
7360200	7363800	I'm just, I'm always very skeptical of everything,
7363800	7366600	but also myself at the same time and try to say,
7366600	7369520	I mean, I can appreciate ideas that maybe I disagree with.
7372040	7377040	And it'd be very difficult to say anything absolutely.
7378360	7379200	I could-
7379800	7381040	Well, it's interesting though,
7381040	7386040	I hear a typical trope by more public intellectuals
7386880	7391400	is be skeptical, be open-minded, be critical,
7391400	7392880	be objective, be rational,
7392880	7396800	we hear all these terms thrown around quite a lot, isn't it?
7396800	7400600	But it's also sometimes I think,
7400600	7405200	I'm not trying to pick on a particular public intellectual,
7405200	7407560	like someone like Steven Pinko or Sam Harris
7407560	7411320	who constantly to almost like ad nauseam,
7411320	7413880	talk about rationality and reason
7413880	7415960	and being open-minded and whatnot.
7417880	7421360	They also don't seem to get it that in fact, firstly,
7421360	7425200	being skeptical, being critical is,
7425200	7427040	it's a really difficult thing to do.
7427040	7430840	It's in fact quite unnerving.
7430840	7433480	It leaves one in this state of angst
7433480	7435560	and there's no stability in one's life.
7436560	7440120	And it's, if you truly authentically do it
7440120	7443320	in a very genuine, sincere way,
7443320	7448320	it can leave one unraveled, uprooted, you know?
7448560	7450320	It's not an easy thing to do.
7450320	7454040	No wonder you see, it's like what Dostoevsky said,
7454040	7459040	it seems that men with large hearts and deep minds
7459800	7462160	seem to be the most miserable.
7463600	7465520	And I think he says that in common punishment,
7465520	7467320	I'm paraphrasing him.
7467320	7470960	And then also comes the other thing where even these,
7470960	7473760	again, what should I call them?
7473760	7476040	New Age Atheists, not New Age Atheists,
7476040	7479320	like the New Atheists, so again, public intellectuals,
7479320	7483440	they, for me, all of their skepticism,
7483440	7485160	it's not skeptical enough.
7485160	7487560	They still are very much a domain,
7487560	7489360	their own domain of reason or whatever.
7489360	7493120	It seems like they haven't explored many other areas
7493120	7497520	that probably, then probably would even unravel them
7497520	7499880	because all of their work would also then deconstruct
7499880	7500720	and break down.
7502320	7504560	And that's funny, because that's when you were talking
7504560	7506080	about specifically proud of,
7506080	7507240	I know you didn't want to pick on anybody,
7507240	7509240	but when you brought up Sam Harris, you know,
7509240	7511200	I just thought, yeah, he's always talking about
7511200	7512120	people should be skeptical,
7512120	7516120	but I don't think he's skeptical about his own thoughts at all.
7516120	7517960	But just that, yeah, it's not for,
7517960	7521000	he doesn't portray that, he doesn't give that impression.
7521080	7524280	He never, he hasn't questioned himself enough to,
7524280	7526840	for me to say, yeah, he's skeptical.
7526840	7529040	I don't think he's very skeptical at all.
7529040	7531400	Yeah, because it seems that, again,
7531400	7533200	I don't know why, I guess this is a very arbitrary
7533200	7535280	and just big Sam Harris, but even Sam Harris,
7535280	7539400	he has his foundational like axioms he works of,
7539400	7541960	but within those axioms, he will question,
7541960	7545160	he'll be critical, but he never tries to break down
7545160	7547240	those axioms themselves, which I feel,
7547240	7549800	which is why I admire an intellectual like Heidegger,
7549800	7552040	which is what Heidegger was trying to do.
7553240	7558000	And that's, yeah, I guess all I would say,
7558000	7561480	Jacob, especially, thanks a lot, man.
7561480	7562440	I truly am grateful.
7562440	7564680	As I said, I'm a complete amateur,
7564680	7567640	so it means a lot that you shared your work with me,
7567640	7570440	even the stuff that you haven't publicly published
7570440	7572080	for me to go through and study.
7573000	7576000	I haven't read the whole of being in time yet.
7576000	7579600	Slowly working my way through it, you know,
7579600	7581720	plotting along, one could say,
7581720	7584200	but it's a worthwhile journey.
7584200	7588800	It's also something I've realized, I do it now more as,
7588800	7591040	in some sense, it's like a moral responsibility
7591040	7593320	that I'm obliged to do this,
7593320	7595120	that I should make time for it.
7596720	7600680	And that means spending a lot of time in solitude,
7601800	7604480	not really getting out, but the point I was trying to make
7604480	7606680	is I think you're a great thinker,
7606680	7609400	you're a fantastic writer.
7609400	7611120	We didn't really get much into the writing,
7611120	7612360	hopefully in the next episode,
7612360	7616440	but I can't thank you enough, Jacob, it means a lot.
7616440	7620840	You're a good bloke and I'm looking forward to the work
7620840	7623800	you do in the future, more and more of what you write.
7623800	7626520	And when you do write the,
7626520	7628800	when your being in time comes out,
7628800	7633120	let's have another episode and talk about your magnum opus.
7633120	7636720	That's fair, sure, certainly, yeah, I really appreciate it.
7636720	7640120	Thanks for having me on and chatting.
7640120	7643320	And I'll just reiterate something I said earlier,
7643320	7648320	if you guys want to read any of the papers
7648440	7651480	and I can't find them or can't get ahold of them,
7652640	7657400	feel free to contact me and they'll be happy to be over.
7658400	7663400	And again, I'm a better writer than I am a speaker, so.
7664240	7666040	Oh, no, man, you did great, trust me.
7666040	7668040	I am not good at neither,
7668040	7672160	so you actually just got one thing to get out of the writing.
7672160	7674360	But not just, Jacob, just on that note though,
7674360	7677520	you said that your website was still under construction.
7677520	7681720	So if I do leave a link to the website,
7681720	7683480	it's probably not going to load,
7683480	7687080	but is the domain going to be the same one
7687080	7689760	or are you going to change it completely?
7689760	7692280	The domain will stay the same.
7692480	7695320	Yeah, the website is under maintenance right now.
7695320	7698480	I'm kind of revamping it to,
7698480	7700680	I'm trying to provide resources and information
7700680	7703440	about phenomenology and existentialism
7703440	7705960	and specifically meaning and meaningfulness
7705960	7710800	and just trying to provide a little bit of direction
7710800	7713600	for people that are looking to read more about the stuff
7713600	7715560	and study it and yeah.
7715560	7718520	So I can't say how soon it will be finished,
7718520	7722000	but I would say it's not going to be
7722000	7726800	more than maybe three weeks or four weeks from now.
7726800	7730880	Fantastic, yeah, I'll try to get this up as soon as possible.
7730880	7735200	In any case, I shall leave a link to your Twitter account
7735200	7736440	or Twitter profile,
7736440	7738120	and then if people do want to get in touch with you,
7738120	7740720	they could contact you there, correct?
7741680	7744080	Yep, certainly, yeah, and I think I might even have a link
7744080	7745160	to my website on,
7746000	7748720	if you don't put it on here or whatever,
7748720	7750840	people can find it, I think on my Twitter.
7750840	7752720	Perfect, thanks mate, cheers.
7752720	7755720	I shall stop recording now, take care.
