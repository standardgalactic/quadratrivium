0	5040	Hey everyone, so in the last couple of years I began to feel this sense of
5040	12300	cynicism and deep pessimism growing in our culture and I'd even say it started
12300	18080	coming into my personal and private life not at a philosophical abstract level
18080	23000	but really in my day-to-day intimate interactions and I started feeling that
23000	29040	viscerally and a part of me was like you got to give the devil his deal you know
29040	34800	I think you can't justify a certain level of cynicism in this world we live in
34800	41200	and that's what inspired this essay you know I write to think and for the
41200	46120	longest time I wrote for myself my private thoughts you know journaling
46120	51640	just taking down notes here and there and I think I finally mastered up the
51640	55320	confidence to start sharing my work publicly you know sharing my writing
55320	60840	publicly even though I tend to ramble a bit so I'm sort of plotting along and
60840	66480	trying to make sense of why I still think despite all the malevolence despite
66480	73640	all the cynicism that is that BCN is justified to a certain level that they
73640	78760	still a case to be made against it a case to be made for living life in the
78760	84880	fullest and deriving meaning out of the world we live in so anyway I hope you
84920	89680	enjoyed this essay it's actually a an essay I wrote for medium and my you know
89680	93400	personal blog and I'm just reading it out because I do know that a lot of people
93400	97840	prefer listening or watching it instead of reading it part of it is obviously
97840	103720	subjective and personal to me but then I also think most of it is really something
103720	108720	that's applicable to all of us that's like an objective truth let's say but
108720	113720	yeah I'm keen to hear your thoughts I hope you enjoy it let's get to it now
114360	120080	against cynicism my case for living life to the fullest
122600	127840	to my partners annoyance I have a running joke I make at social gatherings
127840	134560	about wanting to have 10 kids one day enough to play a 515 basketball game I
134560	140800	tell myself the reason behind the joke is for some engaging befuddling humor to
140800	144760	lighten up the mood in a room even though it mostly leaves me having to
144760	150600	explain the joke awkwardly and even then most people do not find it funny yet
150600	154640	the more I think about it I feel as if this is something my heart truly
154640	161240	desires to have many kids probably not 10 and become a father someday hopefully
161240	166880	a good one as the adage goes there's a grain of truth in every joke but then I
166920	172440	think why would I want to do something that absurdly impractical when evidence
172440	176760	suggests that as people get more educated they tend to have fewer children
176760	181320	why would I want to go against the tide leaving aside the ridiculous number of
181320	186760	kids why even bring a child into this God for second world scourged by climate
186760	195240	change pandemics a lamentable economy and alarming social unrest how selfish
195520	200520	and cruel of us to inflict such inevitable misery onto another human
200520	205560	being by bringing them into this world and even worse what if my posterity
205560	210920	becomes totalitarian and deceitful tyrants who end up exacerbating the
210920	215720	agony of people I've heard people say that loving a child is sacrificial and
215720	222960	such selfless love is the highest of all virtues utter nonsense one could argue
223000	227400	as it looks to me that most people willingly have children leaving aside
227400	233600	the accidents only to overcome the soul sucking banality of their life and don't
233600	239320	get me started on love sheer boredom drives us to find love it is a self
239320	245360	centered facade of intimacy even the unconditional love of God is conditional
245360	251280	as he necessitates for repentance prior to our salvation if God truly loved
251320	256960	his children why couldn't he just forgive us instead of sacrificing his own son
256960	261640	for atonement most people deceive themselves of being in love only when
261640	266120	it's passion and their absolute inability to live with themselves that
266120	270440	prepidatiously hold together their relationship it's why John Baptiste
270440	276600	Clemens recognized in Albert canons the fall of course true love is exceptional
276640	282400	two or three times a century more or less the rest of the time there's vanity
282400	288440	or boredom even if let's say love doesn't have to entail a higher virtue over
288440	295480	mere passion and all love necessitates is just that passion alone is in passion
295480	300240	itself a selfish pursuit supposed a man or woman audaciously follows their
300240	305560	dreams and aspirations in that case it seems like an awfully privileged
305920	310520	position handed to them by society and most people in the world wouldn't have
310520	315920	that fortune some may even say aspiration is for the spoil and ungrateful
315920	321240	desiring something more than being satisfied with the life they're given
321240	326600	as I've demonstrated above being cynical towards life isn't difficult but the
326600	331960	only question really worth asking is what to do after we've rationalized our
332000	339240	sense system that's what I try to deal with in this essay a caveat questioning
339240	344240	the answerable can leave us in a grim place the angst it brings makes us
344240	349440	bitter, misanthropic and implacable hence it's not surprising that we
349440	355160	intentionally repress these gratuitous thoughts and cling to what the rest of
355160	360240	society does with their lives the social zeitgeist protects us from insanity
360680	365040	it's more comforting to distract ourselves with a political or celebrity
365040	370240	scandal rather than looking into the festering wounds in our own lives and
370240	375960	reality itself at least for myself have it to I have been rather fortunate in my
375960	383120	life a lot of unearned good has come my way mostly through those I love and yet
383120	389040	these existential questions haunt me despite my good luck I have spent
389040	393040	countless nights trying to integrate my serendipity with the world's
393040	403080	unjust cruelty how dare I benefit from unmerited happiness it's not gratitude I
403080	409880	feel but a peculiar type of consternation at life I swear you gentlemen
409880	415520	that to be overly conscious is a sickness a real tarot sickness
415520	420720	Voidol Dostoevsky even while I'm writing this piece I question my
420720	426040	privilege and impertinence in asking such nonsensical questions about love
426040	433120	marriage and passion a part of myself is still yelling at me go do some work
433120	440840	hippie these aren't questions one should bother asking last year a friend of mine
440840	446360	unexpectedly passed away she was a beautiful soul her funeral was in
446360	451560	Sri Lanka and I couldn't attend it because I live in Australia but I saw her
451560	460080	wailing parents through the funeral livestream how cruel is the caprice of
460080	466240	life I thought and how arbitrary is the nature of suffering I particularly
466240	472720	remember her mom when I was growing up in Sri Lanka she was a loving and kind
472720	480960	lady what has she done to deserve such so crushing sorrow of losing a child how
480960	486160	could nature be so malignant my friend's death was a clear rebuttal of how life
486160	491760	ought to be as I was told parents aren't supposed to bury their children but it
491760	495720	ought to be the other way around I sit here in my comfortable apartment
495720	501360	typing and philosophizing away on my nifty computer wondering if I dug
501360	507320	myself into a hole too deep how privileged am I to dig this hole of my
507320	512560	own free will when my parents when my friend's parents were pushed into it by
512560	518520	the faded tragedy of life however privilege or misfortune angst or
518520	524960	gratitude aren't justifiable reasons to evade and hide from such questions we
524960	530000	shouldn't give way to the pretense and at times distractions of mundane life
530000	535960	that we all use to cushion ourselves from the existential blows of living nor
535960	541200	should we neolistically succumb to fatalistic resentment both these forms
541200	546840	of living are out of cowardice once a question is asked not as a mere
546840	553800	utterance but as an but as an authentic form of being itself and how we live
553840	559000	through our actions emotions words desires or whatever constitutes an
559000	565720	individual no reason we used to hide from such questions are adequate unless we
565720	570320	confront truth regardless of the consequences these questions will
570320	575520	enduringly haunt us forever every objection I brought up against children
575520	581640	or procreation marriage love passion and even gold salvation can be rebuked
581880	587360	through cogent arguments inferred from numerous intellectual propositions
587360	592720	and syllogisms a few ad hoc examples environmental activists Mike
592720	598960	Schellenberger makes a systematic case in his book apocalypse never as to why we
598960	603480	should be more optimistic about climate change and not capitulate to
603480	607600	anti-human sentiments such as not having children because of the environment
607920	612080	he emphasizes we should focus on humanitarian development and elevating
612080	616600	people from poverty as this has proven to be one of the best remedies for
616600	620760	imminent environmental problems the following tweet thread succinctly
620760	625360	highlights his worry about young people not wanting to have children due to
625360	632960	climate change I should stipulate that my intention behind using Schellenberger's
633000	638360	ideas as an example wasn't me taking a political stance on the matter of
638360	644080	climate change I stand neutral on the complicated subject as I'm grossly
644080	649280	uninformed about its nuances a big lie that pathologize society since the
649280	655040	1960s with the publication of books such as the population bomb is a myth of
655040	660360	dangerous overpopulation that lead to global famine and environmental
660480	666480	catastrophe up till now these radical claims seem unsubstantiated for
666480	672080	instance Lehman Stone from Vox states in his article why he shouldn't obsess
672080	678560	about overpopulation lowering US carbon intensity by about a third to around the
678560	684280	level of manufacturing superpower Germany today has a bigger effect than
684280	690400	preventing 100 million Americans from existing there's only one way to
690400	695240	effectively prevent alleviate or reverse dangerous climate change
695240	700960	technological geographic and social advancement population has little to do
700960	707200	with it especially not in the US despite the terrible consequences of COVID-19
707200	712200	we also made unprecedented progress in epidemiology and vaccination
712200	716880	development while I'm not reducing the suffering people went through due to the
716880	722400	pandemic modern medicines expedition is a scientific miracle we've seen in the
722400	728040	last few months UCLA health reports in a remarkable achievement of medical
728040	732480	science we've gone from identifying a new pathogen discovering an immune
732480	738200	response against it to developing and testing a safe and effective vaccine for
738200	744360	it in less than 12 months previously the fastest vaccination to go from
744360	750200	development to deployment was the mom's vaccine in the 1960s which took about four
750200	758000	years all these developments were obviously done by human beings therefore
758000	763080	using the pandemic as an example we could extrapolate the remedy to every other
763080	768280	problem we face including social unrest unfavorable economic conditions
768280	775120	environmental issues etc the answers lie in people the more talented people who
775120	780480	come to live the most solutions we will find through their skills looking through
780480	786320	a pure utilitarian ethical lens we need a bigger talent pool provided they have
786320	792800	equal opportunity to create more value in this world or crassly stating we need
792800	799400	more people to exploit more good from humanity for the world however pure
799400	804080	talent alone isn't what makes an individual remarkable it's a combination
804080	808400	of exceptional character and innate ability in their respective attitudes
808400	814720	therefore such excellence is rare and the only way to increase our plane of
814720	819920	serendipity is to increase the number of human beings the individual being a
819920	825680	central part of creation is an unbelievably ancient ideal it runs deep
825680	830200	into the mythology and stories that hold our cultures specifically the
830200	835280	Western world together the individual is the correct level of analysis as there
835280	840600	is a fundamental truth that speaks to a human beings sacredness and sublimity it
840600	845280	speaks so deeply that we couldn't even dare to question its validity for the
845320	851000	longest time in human history it would be considered sinful the book of Genesis
851000	857360	explicitly stating Imago day gold created man in his own image is a
857360	863320	proclamation of humanity being endowed by the divine to bring forth a new
863320	870200	reality into being the proposition of Imago day is a metaphysical problem that
870200	875520	philosophers are still trying to comprehend fully yet most modern
875520	881680	societies are undergirded by the concept of human rights which we invariably
881680	887360	cannot violate even the most obtruse and esoteric objections I put forward
887360	892880	earlier about gold salvation has been theologically dealt with by philosophers
892880	897760	such as William Lane Craig and Alvin Pantinger if you're interested in the
897760	902640	subject Dr. Craig recently wrote a whole book on the necessity for the death of
902640	908440	Christ for humanity's sins called atonement and the death of Christ and
908440	913040	exegetical historical and philosophical exploration additionally I could
913040	917160	recommend books like Enlightenment now by Stephen Pinker or the rational
917160	922720	optimist by Matt Ridley where both authors argue that humanity has made
922720	927400	unprecedented progress in the last few centuries they're confident we are on
927400	931600	the right track in almost every available measure for social and
931600	937160	environmental progress in the past two centuries providing ample evidence to
937160	944640	ascertain their findings from various research domains books such as these
944640	950160	delineate that we don't have to look any further for the miracle of human progress
950160	954880	and advancement than our own history notwithstanding the conspicuous
954880	960040	malvalence we see in humanity nevertheless none of these intellectual
960040	965600	arguments will satisfy the burdens of our souls at least it didn't do so for
965600	971400	mine I could find an infinite amount of philosophies from every domain of thought
971400	977840	known to human epistemology but still leave a persisting void of despair in
977840	983560	our hearts I know this to be certain as however much science and philosophy
983600	988680	intellectually stimulated me it was nothing compared to the most intimate
988680	995040	fulfillment that beauty valor and love brought to my soul life is in another
995040	1000200	tried philosophical model instead the models are created in trying to
1000200	1005800	understand life itself we do not lead our lives by making a priori decisions
1005800	1011160	weighing the pros and cons similar to a machine learning model that runs on a
1011200	1017280	supervised set of rules for starters this would undeniably drive us insane and
1017280	1022800	most saliently at the least we do not even have a proper phenomenological
1022800	1030640	framework to deal with being we patently exist but this existence isn't the end
1030640	1037040	itself the question lies in what this existence for human beings entails the
1037040	1042600	telos could life be a set of propositional deductions masqueraded as
1042600	1048160	choices or is that too simplistic disregarding copious amounts of modern
1048160	1054360	scientific research research and a an ancient wisdom found across cultures for
1054360	1061000	a moment simple observation of regular life will show that seldom do we let
1061320	1068600	PO empiricism logic and cold rationalism guide our lives nor am I sure if we
1068600	1074400	should necessarily make rationalism the highest of human virtues contrary to
1074400	1078360	what the Enlightenment think is proclaimed life can be more accurately
1078360	1084240	portrayed through inspiration romance intuition serendipity synchronicity and
1084240	1089280	all those bewildering elements of reality that would be dismissed as
1089320	1096200	superfluous occultism by modernists none of these metaphysical or spiritual
1096200	1101880	phenomena that still are meaningful occurrences can be explained through the
1101880	1108360	modern scientific method and rationalism to make sense of those transcendent
1108360	1114840	realities we need the arts we need to revivify our fading appreciation for
1114840	1120920	aesthetics as Oscar Wilde wrote paradox though it may seem and paradoxes are
1120920	1127280	always dangerous things it is nonetheless true that life imitates art far more
1127280	1133560	than art imitates life for example to elucidate my point I could use a grim
1133560	1139200	philosophy called antinatalism utilizing the work of its leading advocate in
1139200	1144760	contemporary times David Beneter the antinatalist position is that humans
1144800	1149800	should stain from procreation because it's morally wrong to bring more
1149800	1154840	children to this world and what if and it would have been better for us to never
1154840	1158640	have been born in the first place
1158640	1163960	professor Beneter asserts the following presuppositional asymmetry between
1163960	1169440	pleasure and pain which the whole philosophy rests on number one the
1169440	1175960	presence of pain is bad number two the presence of pleasure is good number three
1175960	1182300	the absence of pain is good even if that pain is not enjoyed by anyone number
1182300	1187800	four the absence of pleasure is not bad unless they somebody for whom this
1187800	1193320	absence is a deprivation therefore if human beings cease to exist it still
1193360	1199880	fulfills point number three and four theoretically miss a really David
1199880	1205440	Beneter may seem like an evil person is evidently anti-human ideas could be the
1205440	1211440	same worldviews that motivated nihilistic school shooters and ruthless tyrants
1211440	1218480	publicly unveiling the human hearts innate malevolence I remember my
1218480	1222880	emotional reaction to coming across his work how in the world could Oxford
1222880	1229960	University Press even publish such a reprehensible book yet as I delve into
1229960	1235360	his work and the individual behind those ideas I discovered a person who isn't
1235360	1241600	much worse than the rest of us fools he did not have an irrational hatred for
1241600	1246480	humanity and he certainly wasn't stating that people currently living should be
1246480	1252280	wiped off the face of the planet in fastical irony he dedicated his book
1252560	1258560	better never to have been to his progenitor stating to my parents even
1258560	1262960	though they brought me into existence Beneter is simply an academic
1262960	1267760	philosopher putting forward a set of ideas similar to what socrates all
1267760	1272640	the stoics have done historically his assertion isn't particularly novel
1272640	1277520	either it's something human beings always wondered through a discussion that
1277560	1282320	goes all the way to the book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament and
1282320	1287000	I declared that the dead who had already died are happier than the living who are
1287000	1293320	still alive but better than both is the one who has never been born who has not
1293320	1298840	seen the evil that is under the sun I'm not a philosopher nor do I care for the
1298840	1304560	sort of generative philosophy that acts only in the plane of abstractions there's
1304560	1308920	nothing more convenient than creating asymmetries and inferring conclusions
1308920	1315560	within a finite set of ad hoc rules where we define the axioms I've lazily done
1315560	1321000	that even in parts of this essay it's what Albert Camel understood in the
1321000	1326280	myth of Sisyphus which in my opinion makes him a true and rare philosopher
1326280	1331120	there is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is
1331120	1337560	suicide judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering
1337560	1343000	the fundamental question of philosophy all the rest whether or not the world
1343000	1347840	has three dimensions whether the mind has nine or twelve categories comes
1347840	1354840	afterwards these are games one must first answer and if it is true as nature
1354840	1360240	claims that a philosopher to deserve our respect must preach by example you can
1360280	1365360	appreciate the importance of that reply for it will proceed the definitive act
1365360	1372800	these are facts the heart can feel yet they call for careful study before they
1372800	1379040	can become clear to the intellect was Mike Tyson crassly said everybody has a
1379040	1382600	plan until they get punched in the mouth
1382600	1388000	nevertheless despite my objections to conceptualizing life as a philosophical
1388040	1392920	model and prescribing eschatological judgments on living I will engage in
1392920	1398200	bentis example for expediency's sake but I will not engage as a philosopher as I
1398200	1403720	don't think the age-old question that was asked in Hamlet Solakway is a
1403720	1409560	philosophical one to be or not to be that is the question the fundamental
1409560	1415600	axiom in asymmetry between pain and pleasure presupposes one that the
1415600	1421480	presence of pain is bad and to the presence of pleasure is good I disagree
1421480	1427520	with this presupposition it isn't clear that life can be good only if its pain
1427520	1432960	is entirely eliminated from being and all and all human beings had was
1432960	1439000	infinite bliss and pleasure nor does it seem like as Dostoevsky understood
1439000	1446080	human beings will desire such a mode of living one of my childhood heroes was
1446080	1452960	Lakshman Kadergama okay a Sri Lankan statesman and a lawyer during his time
1452960	1458200	as the Minister of Foreign Affairs he was a key figure in Sri Lanka civil war
1458200	1464080	against the LTE a separatist service organization for example the independent
1464080	1470000	reported on his vitality for global politics Kadergama was not just any
1470000	1474880	senior minister he was the highest ranking ethnic Tamil in the government
1474880	1480400	more than that he was the man who was responsible more than anyone for drying
1480400	1485760	up international support for the Tamil Tigers the LTE it was his
1485760	1490840	international campaign that has a tiger's name as a banned terrorist
1490840	1497400	organization in the US UK and other countries similar to similar awards in
1497400	1503680	any other country Sri Lanka's conflict has a nuanced and complicated history and
1503680	1510600	yet most Sri Lankans would unequivocally agree LK was a national hero he was
1510600	1516240	posthumously awarded the highest national honor Sri Lanka Bhimanya a title
1516240	1523600	shared by Sir Atsi Clark in hindsight I believe my father giving me LK's
1523600	1528760	biography to read was the impetus behind my interest in studying politics ethics
1528760	1536040	and philosophy outstanding his profuse security and protection on August 12th
1536040	1544200	2005 LK was assassinated by an LTE sniper in LK's biography his son Raghi
1544200	1551000	states when he was assassinated it was of course not a complete surprise part of
1551000	1559120	me had been expecting it for years his daughter Ajita concludes perhaps fate
1559120	1564560	intervened on the night of August 12th but chance he allowed it to in the
1564560	1571240	knowledge that his every move was being watched in the final analysis it is
1571240	1577800	possible that Lakshman Kaduragama shows to meet his death that night as a sniper
1577800	1582720	sat there trigger ready target in sight
1588320	1593320	Lakshman Kaduragama's life was a quintessential hero's journey in a way
1593320	1599560	he plays an archetypal role in my mind a true patriot that lived a life of
1599560	1605600	nobility who wrote in a friend's autograph book at the age of 14 how
1605600	1612760	sweet and honorable is it to die for one's country and still his biography
1612760	1618680	doesn't depict a life of bliss and pleasure without any pain instead a
1618680	1625080	life of angst grief strife and the tremendous weight of carrying the
1625080	1630840	burden of a bloody and ruthless ethnic conflict according to David Bennett's
1630840	1638280	hypothesis LK's life would be a bad one due to due to its inherent pain but most
1638280	1643440	people would agree that he'll be good life it'll be philosophically laborious or
1643440	1648880	probably impossible to reason and delineate this good but the purpose
1648880	1654200	Lakshman Kaduragama lived for transcended all of his pain for the more
1654200	1661560	his noble being created more overall good for the world stories like LK's
1661560	1667600	remind me that hypothetical philosophical models will never explain life and
1667600	1672920	reality we cannot create arbitrary axioms of good and bad to justify a living
1672920	1677840	it's impossible ever to know all the consequences of living both good and
1677840	1685160	bad intended or unintended besides how dare I adjudicate if a potential future
1685160	1693360	person was to be born after a 30 year old war that took over 100,000 lives what
1693360	1699240	would it be Trilanka's fate if Lakshman Kaduragama never came into being an
1699240	1706840	answerable yet deeply moving question it's this impenetrable enigma and
1706840	1713040	sublime inexplicability of life that mandates are so lived as we'll never
1713040	1719000	know if life's worth living until we have all together and entirely lived it as
1719000	1725160	one of Soran Kedricar's journals say it is really true what philosophy tells us
1725160	1730760	that life must be understood backwards but with this one forgets the second
1730760	1737040	proposition that it must be lived forwards a proposition which the more it
1737040	1743000	is subjected to careful thought the more it ends up concluding precisely that
1743000	1750120	life at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood exactly
1750120	1755800	exactly because there is no single moment where time stops completely in
1755840	1763240	order for me to take the position to do this going backwards often shortened to
1763240	1769360	life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards I'm a
1769360	1773800	software engineer and a few weeks ago I was having dinner at a steakhouse with
1773800	1778800	one of my collegial engineers we had a fascinating conversation that led us all
1778800	1784680	the way from discussing Roger Penrose's hypothesis on consciousness to me asking
1784680	1790760	him mate if I may ask what does love mean to you he
1790760	1797440	unhesitantly replied love gives me a reason for eternity I thought deeply
1797440	1803200	about this response only love has the metamorphosing ability to turn an
1803200	1808160	engineer who typically works in the technical realm of logic and cold
1808160	1816000	abstractions into a port and produce such beautiful statement my fortune to
1816000	1821960	fall in love with Shannon the most remarkable woman who if my luck prevails
1821960	1827320	I hope to marry someday has convinced me that love is the most irrational
1827320	1833800	chaotic and incomprehensible force of being that captivates our life like no
1833800	1840040	other many have tried but no port or philosopher could ever accurately
1840040	1846960	portray what love means to a human being I think this may be why the phrase goes
1846960	1854800	I fell in love not I willed my way into love none of us plan to fall in love it
1854800	1861960	just happens love is unplanned yet timeless unbidden it's yet yearnful
1861960	1868680	obtruse yet tangible so real yet meaningful and ultimately we find a
1868680	1874720	reason to live because of love alone this is why I think even Fitzwilliam
1874720	1880360	Darcy had to go again societal standards and his own prejudice judgment as love
1880360	1884880	drove him to profess his feelings towards Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and
1884880	1891680	Prejudice in vain have I struggled it will not do my feelings will not be
1891680	1898920	repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you
1898920	1904280	however even if love alone gives a reason to live this life still worth
1904280	1910360	living to the fullest even if the emotions evoked in us by love are good
1910360	1916480	and absolutely real does love justify doing anything that benefits oneself
1916760	1922080	like following one's passion marriage or having children firstly unless someone
1922080	1926800	can prove otherwise doing things that are beneficial and good for ourselves
1926800	1932160	isn't inherently selfish immoral or unjustifiable due to Eastern
1932160	1937880	philosophies influence with ideas like impermanence or non-self accentuated by
1937880	1944640	rampant materialism secularism and growing radical self-criticism within
1944640	1952040	Western culture Westerners have begun to feel guilty for their own being with the
1952040	1956200	loss of religion and consequently spirituality being jettisoned from the
1956200	1961960	cultural ethos Westerners feel their individual lives are a waste of space
1961960	1968760	on this planet or maybe even a pest brutally exploiting Gaia benevolent
1968760	1973840	mother nature dr. Carl you in all his brilliance and wisdom understood the
1973840	1980040	death of spirituality in 1957 and prophetically warned us of the ominous
1980040	1988280	signs in his essay the undiscovered self just as man as a social being cannot in
1988280	1994120	the long run exist without a tie to the community so the individual will never
1994120	1999400	find the real justification for his existence and his own spiritual and
1999400	2006800	moral autonomy anywhere except in an extra mundane principle capable of
2006800	2013600	relativizing the overpowering influence of external factors the individual who
2013600	2018760	is not anchored in God can offer no resistance on his own resources to the
2018760	2026040	physical and moral blandishments of the world for this he needs the evidence of
2026080	2031000	inner transcendent experience which alone can protect him from the otherwise
2031000	2038400	inevitable submersion in the mass therefore with such negation of the
2038400	2045640	individual self any act not serving the greater good but one self is looked
2045640	2051360	down upon by contemporary culture but we must ignore scornful societal
2051360	2056400	condescension and judgment as such nihilistic pessimism is futile and
2056400	2061880	serves no purpose but only breeds resentment suppose something we find
2061880	2067160	meaningful is good for us and this minimal harm nothing is entirely innocuous
2067160	2074440	to society in that case there's no good reason to not do that thing undertaking
2074440	2079280	such responsibility may even be a divine duty notwithstanding our
2079320	2086640	consciousness of our own shortcomings and unworthiness secondly a bizarre
2086640	2092280	realization we eventually come to have about life is that doing things not for
2092280	2097640	ostensible virtue but genuine goodness that gives us a real sense of meaning
2097640	2103880	mutual mutually benefits both society and ourselves getting married to a person
2103880	2108480	we love begins a family one of society's most foundational and imperative
2108480	2113840	units for it to function even if it were for entirely selfish reasons we
2113840	2120280	decide to have a child let's say as a remedy for trisinarian odum this act
2120280	2126960	results in bringing forth a new life and every human being is the epicenter of
2126960	2132480	untapped potential and creation embarking on an entrepreneurial artistic or
2132480	2138000	sporting venture merely to live out one's passion creates unforeseeable
2138000	2143240	value in society and hopefully if done portfully even benefits the planet
2143240	2149920	symbiotically not just in the cliche capitalist tenor of transactional value
2149920	2153920	creation but even through those heavenly aspects of life that cannot be
2153920	2160760	commoditized i.e. inspiration beauty elegance awe and wonder all of this
2160760	2165160	goodness comes into being despite the inherent suffering and malevolence
2165160	2171960	inexorably present in life however if we cannot see the divine ethos in this
2171960	2177760	paradoxical miracle of being alive then nothing could stand up to our nihilistic
2177760	2184520	and cruel judgment but what if we peel the onion one more layer why be good
2184520	2190320	why not wreck havoc in society and burn it all to the ground it certainly
2190480	2194920	creates circular reasoning to assert what must be good for the sake of
2194920	2201040	goodness fortunately for reasons I can't fathom Abrahamic religions have a
2201040	2205680	straightforward answer to this dilemma and I'm yet to find a better
2205680	2211440	explanation or a more truthful narrative than this ancient story as it's an
2211440	2216960	ultimate divine calling from God beginning with the Old Testament we are
2216960	2224000	told so God created mankind in his own image and the image of God he created
2224000	2232680	them male and female he created them Genesis 127 straddling to the cumulative
2232680	2238560	commandment by Jesus of Nazareth in the Gospels thou shall love thy neighbor as
2238560	2245120	thyself as many philosophers like Sartor and Dostoevsky understood there's no
2245120	2251840	God all is permitted the central stipulation of this viewpoint is
2251840	2257200	without a tangible moral absolute God specifically the monotheistic God
2257200	2263960	humanity is left in a moral miasma of ethical oblivion and a volatile values
2263960	2269480	framework it would be like trying to do theoretical physics without mathematics
2269840	2276960	William Lane Craig recents accordingly in his apologetics book on God to say
2276960	2281440	that the Holocaust was objectively raw is to say that the Holocaust was raw
2281440	2288320	even though the Nazis who carried it out thought that it was right and and it
2288320	2293520	would still have been wrong even if the Nazis had won World War two and succeeded
2293520	2298880	in brainwashing or exterminating everybody who disagreed with them so that
2298920	2304480	everyone in the world thought that the Holocaust was right and good to say that
2304480	2308880	the Holocaust was objectively raw means that it's wrong regardless of the
2308880	2314440	outcomes of World War two the premise is that if there's no God then moral
2314440	2320320	values or duties are not objective in that sense and yet my unreasonable and
2320320	2325280	rebellious heart is still unfulfilled I don't think human divinity can be
2325280	2330720	reduced to a sentence, catchphrase, proposition, philosophical stipulation,
2330720	2335720	commandment or law. Tenets could be extrapolated from our understanding of
2335720	2342320	divinity for pragmatic or applicative sake i.e. Ten Commandments, Magna Carta,
2342320	2348520	Universal Declaration of Human Rights but instances of divinity don't encompass
2348520	2355040	all of its truth they only allude to its actuality our limited cognition knowledge
2355280	2361560	and language gategoal and human divinity the moment it's instantiated for
2361560	2367760	comprehension the ultimate catch-22 a celestial provocation that's making our
2367760	2373880	predicament rather comical it's this absurdity of living that makes life both
2373880	2380320	a tragedy and comedy I see this quandary unfold in my life every day from the
2380320	2384600	moment I wake up in the morning sometimes I'm an atheistic relativist and
2384880	2391120	other times I'm a spiritual being piously carrying out my divine duty it's
2391120	2395040	not that I don't see the logical contradiction in this way of living I
2395040	2399960	perfectly understand my folly but it's the most accurate way I can portray my
2399960	2406720	dilemma and I know I'm not the only one maybe human beings created philosophy to
2406720	2411960	deal with this spontaneous morality driven mainly by emotions that emerge in
2411960	2417920	life we need coherent providence for cosmic forlorness from a cold and
2417920	2423120	indifferent universe nevertheless our salvation does not lie in a simple
2423120	2430400	postulation i.e. I'm a Christian Muslim or Jew I'm a Buddhist or Hindu I'm an
2430400	2437080	atheist or skeptic etc we are too mercurial to be herald by mere label
2437880	2443120	I'll observe myself being bizarre by ruining a perfectly good week by doing
2443120	2449480	something that I hate which makes me miserable and self-loathing the label
2449480	2453760	I used to define my identity is unavailing and meaningless during these
2453760	2462680	times so I ask knowing exactly what or what not to do why does my it define my
2462720	2468680	conscience do otherwise it is naive to think we base our lives on a philosophical
2468680	2475040	proposition or some arbitrary religious or non-religious label ask yourself how
2475040	2479840	often do you do things you hate contemporary psychology may call this
2479840	2485600	self-destructive behavior but identifying its reality doesn't answer the
2485600	2491120	fundamental question why do human beings act out in this peculiar and
2491120	2497240	nonsensical way when we observe our lives in retrospect it seems clear that
2497240	2502800	rationality explains very little about our condition I'm yet to find a
2502800	2507680	quintessential rationalist even in my highly technical field of computer
2507680	2514120	science where people mainly deal with logical abstractions people remain true
2514120	2520040	to their nature I think this is why it's poignant to see modern society reduce
2520160	2525800	the human experience to pragmatic utilitarianism and carelessly disregard
2525800	2530760	any sense of the sublime therefore given that life resembles more a symphony or
2530760	2536040	story over an a priori culturalistic mechanism how do we deal with this
2536040	2541280	existential volatility at least for now I've concluded what's ultimately left
2541280	2547400	for us to do is to take a Kierkegaardian leap of faith according to the Sanford
2547400	2551920	Encyclopedia of Philosophy for Kierkegaard Christian faith is not a
2551920	2557800	matter of regurgitating church dogma it is a matter of individual subjective
2557800	2564480	passion which cannot be mediated by the clergy or by human artifacts faith is the
2564480	2569520	most important task to be achieved by a human being because only on the basis of
2569520	2575400	faith does an individual have a chance to become a true self this self is a
2575480	2583040	lifework which God judges for eternity it has taken me years to understand what
2583040	2588840	faith meant to human beings reading Kierkegaard at least shed some light on
2588840	2594920	the matter he uses Abraham from the book of Genesis and the modifical night of
2594920	2601360	faith in his book fear and trembling to expound how he viewed faith people are
2601360	2605480	unable to bear the martyrdom unintelligently jump off the pile and
2605480	2611720	choose instead conveniently enough the world's admiration of their proficiency
2611720	2618240	the true night of faith is a witness never a teacher and in this lies the
2618240	2623560	deep humanity in him which is more word than this foolish concern for others
2623560	2629200	wheel and wall which is honored under the name of sympathy but which is
2629200	2635240	really nothing but vanity the true night of faith is always absolute
2635240	2642440	isolation the false night is sectarian this sectarianism is an attempt to leap
2642440	2648240	away from the narrow path of the paradox and become a tragic hero at a cheap
2648240	2655440	price the tragic hero expresses universal and sacrifices himself for it the
2655440	2661600	sectarian punch in yellow instead of that has a private theater i.e. several
2661600	2666800	good friends and comrades who represent the universal just about as well as the
2666800	2672440	Beatles in the golden snuff box represents justice the individual of faith on
2672440	2677440	the contrary is the paradox is the individual absolutely nothing but the
2677440	2682280	individual without connections or pretensions this is the terrible thing
2682280	2687120	which a sectarian mannequin can't endure for instead of learning from this
2687120	2691560	terror that he's not capable of performing the great deed and then
2691560	2698080	plainly admitting it an act which I cannot but approve because it is what I
2698080	2703960	do the mannequin thinks that by uniting with several other mannequins he will be
2703960	2708920	able to do it but that is quite out of the question in the world of spirit no
2708920	2715480	swindling is tolerated the narrow passage to gold is a lonely journey it has to be
2715480	2721360	or else our faith is mine you can only have faith in our individual pilgrimage
2721360	2726520	and gold when I first came across as philosophy I became depressed I only
2726520	2731240	used to term dramatically as an extra word that likes community and enjoys a
2731240	2737000	good conversation preferably over a fine steak and some whiskey I remember
2737000	2742000	thinking why does arguably the most important journey of our life the one
2742000	2748760	to God have to be a lonely endeavor but then I understood living in faith is a
2748760	2754600	state of being be embodied regardless of our public proclamations it is the only
2754600	2759560	real identity we incarnate that's unconditionally of our own will because
2759560	2765600	every other identity gender race sexuality class etc is
2765600	2772160	inescapably feted by society culture biology and the objective world there's
2772160	2777720	only a subjective spiritual journey that transcends every other material identity
2777720	2784080	given to us by simply being alive therefore refusing to accept our
2784080	2789080	divide divine adventures loneliness and trying to find it through social
2789080	2794480	institutions or the predominant cultural zeitgeist of our times with only
2794520	2800480	corrupt its essence and exacerbate our understandable nihilistic cynicism however
2800480	2806160	we must not misunderstand this journey to be a despondent one around the end of
2806160	2812840	2017 I experienced a somewhat miracle in life despite all my inadequate season
2812840	2819600	flaws I made a conscious choice to embody faith I started not to see the
2819640	2826320	transcendent as a distant deistic reality but rather to see divinity in
2826320	2831560	mundane life or the Christian parlance treat everyone as God's children and
2831560	2838800	everything as God's creation I learned that living on faith took courage most
2838800	2843680	people think it takes courage to face death it doesn't that is inevitable
2844120	2850120	what requires true courage is the will to live I still face the same trials and
2850120	2855760	tribulations of life I did in 2017 albeit I found love in 2018 and that's
2855760	2863280	redemptive to one soul but my choice my lonely leap of faith miraculously rid me
2863280	2869320	of nihilistic cynicism notwithstanding the malevolence and suffering in being
2869400	2877320	recognized every day I doubt I can argue against anti-natalism David
2877320	2882080	Bennett has the verbal virtuosity and it an intellectual prowess that I don't
2882080	2889320	even remotely possess and yet I know the best case I can make against
2889320	2895080	anti-natalism is by how I live the faith I choose to embody is the antidote to
2895080	2900240	cynicism it's at least the best I can do
2901440	2907840	cynicism is the worst form of existence it doesn't help anybody nor is it a
2907840	2912640	remedy to anything it's neither pragmatic nor does it answer the deepest
2912640	2918000	grievances in the human heart a cynic doesn't want to live nor die but only
2918000	2924560	being a state of resentful non-existence a supercilious refusal to partake in
2924560	2931600	life being cynical is just cowardly a piece of animus an unheroic reaction to
2931600	2938480	life yes a lot can and probably will go wrong our passions could be fruitless
2938480	2943360	and lame every venture we start could end up in failure and possible and
2943360	2946480	possible ruin friends will disappoint us
2946480	2952120	unapologetically marriage could end in a better divorce our children might hate
2952160	2958920	us for a pathetic ineptness as parents love could break our heart we will
2958920	2964520	witness unjust suffering and we may even be partly responsible for us for its
2964520	2971520	subsistence during these lamentable moments helpless helplessness will
2971520	2976880	haunt our souls culture will turn eyes us and society will negate our
2976920	2983360	individuality nature will try to wipe us out of existence and there will be times
2983360	2989520	where we feel abandoned and alienated from a cold and dark universe apathetic
2989520	2997400	and indifferent to our feelings but somehow in spite of everything I said
2997400	3003280	it about living by faith vindicates all the ghastly anxiety-evoking horrors of
3003280	3008960	being I can only extrapolate from my journey in the last few years as that's
3008960	3016200	the only worthy story I can tell I found that faith allows the objective and
3016200	3021320	subjective to touch by revealing a phenomenological coherence to the
3021320	3026800	faithful it shows symphony in life and the drama that unfolds as we paradoxically
3026840	3034480	take part in it as both an audience and cast member faith shows how every
3034480	3040720	instance of being is meaningful both subjective and objectively faith is the
3040720	3045720	handmade enough love so we're left with no recalls but to embody faith
3045720	3051240	undergirded by relentless courage in every moment of life we should not think
3051240	3056520	of it as a another distant and anachronistic religious ritual being
3056520	3062280	faithful is an act of bravery for what it's worth I can sincerely say that I
3062280	3066840	try to consciously exercise faith in every aspect of my life career
3066840	3071680	relationships family how I treat strangers and even software engineering
3071680	3077880	I've learned its paramount nature has to be the reason religion is primarily
3077920	3082920	revealed to us through faith as it amalgamates reality like no other
3082920	3088160	I've humbled myself to this truth it's what Kerkakar understood about the
3088160	3096040	crucifixion of Jesus as he writes in the sickness unto death the opposite of sin
3096040	3100560	is not virtue but faith
