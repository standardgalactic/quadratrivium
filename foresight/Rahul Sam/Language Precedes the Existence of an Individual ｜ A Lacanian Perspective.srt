1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
The part I sort of love most about your work

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,640
is your teachings on the Lacanian perspective on language.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,280
So I kind of want to ask from you

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,040
what the kind of meta psychology of Lacan

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,320
tells us about human subjectivity apropos language.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,040
And if I may, I want to read out a short excerpt

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,880
from your book, is that okay?

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,400
Just on the topic of language.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,400
So on page 215, you say the autistic subjects in this case,

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,800
there's no other as language for them.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,400
But then in the introduction,

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,880
there's this really good excerpt that you give,

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,560
which I love to be honest.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,280
It says, yeah, according to Lacan,

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,480
language precedes the existence of an individual

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,840
in the sense that if it exists before he or she is born

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,720
and subsists after his or her death,

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,200
as Fink emphasizes in his book, The Lacanian Subject,

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,760
before a child is born,

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,040
he or she is already endowed with a name as well

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,440
as assigned with the personality,

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,440
all of which are imagined by his or her parents

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,240
through their use of signifiers.

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,000
These signifiers used to endow the child

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,400
with an existence in language are not uniquely invented

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,280
by the parents, but are acquired from a symbolic order

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,880
that has been accumulating for centuries

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,800
preceding his or her conception.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,920
This system of signifiers is governed by a set of laws

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,600
and is determined by Lacan as the other of language.

31
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,240
And I was thinking if anyone needs

32
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,600
kind of some kind of motivation to read more Lacan,

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,760
this excerpt itself should be good enough,

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,520
especially if you're interested in philosophy.

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,200
So Leon, what is Lacan have to say about language

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,560
and why in particular is language so important

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,000
or I would say crucial for Lacanian psychoanalysis?

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,760
Yes, you know, it is language that is important.

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,400
And I'll just say it here,

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,400
but it is the way that language impacts the body

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,200
which is at stake.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,080
So we have to remember that.

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,880
But let's get to it maybe when we continue

44
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,240
and I'll just try and say this a common sensically.

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,880
There's a certain idea

46
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,400
that we might simplify by saying that

47
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,920
when we look at, let's say, or organisms like humans,

48
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,480
we clearly notice that our existence

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,520
has a certain continuity to it.

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,240
Many philosophers tried to think about this

51
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,400
and I think John Locke had a certain idea

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,000
of sort of a string of consciousness

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,640
as long as the same consciousness remains there.

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,760
So that I can say, I was here three months ago,

55
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,560
it's still me, then we say,

56
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,560
oh, there's a certain identity to this prolonged experience.

57
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,640
But even prior to this question,

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,240
in order to conceive of a certain continuation,

59
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,560
a certain, let's say, relationship between

60
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,720
what one experienced that point A

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,840
and what one experiences today,

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,600
we have to assume that something is,

63
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,640
let's say, inscribed somewhere.

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I'll give you an example, a very simple one,

65
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,560
let's say a camera has a lens and has some film.

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,560
Now, if we take out the film,

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,560
the camera, the lens will still see the world.

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,040
The futons will still go through it.

69
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,920
So things will be, let's say, perceived in the world.

70
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,240
But in order for there to be a memory

71
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,240
or to have a certain testimony to that thing that happened,

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,800
we need a film, we need something to be written.

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,240
So language for me, and I think for Lacan,

74
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,600
it's this very essential thing.

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,360
It is whatever is used to write, to inscribe.

76
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
So in this sense, it is not the English language

77
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,360
or the Farsi language or the Japanese language.

78
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,680
It is whatever means one uses

79
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,720
in order to inscribe something that remains.

80
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,880
So it could be just something like this.

81
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,200
We speak about it in many ways.

82
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,520
Psychiatrists speak about it as sort of neuronal connections.

83
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,280
It is a writing in the flesh.

84
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,080
So this is language.

85
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,320
Now, why language is so important for humans?

86
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,920
And this is something that Lacan already says

87
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,480
in his paper on the mirror stage.

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,600
It's a very early paper.

89
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,600
And he says, look, human beings are born underdeveloped.

90
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,000
They're born half-paked.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,280
And you see it in comparison to other animals,

92
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,520
some of which are born

93
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,080
and just start roaming the world if we speak about,

94
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,880
I don't know, insects or lizards or stuff like that.

95
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,640
But also mammals, if you look at mammals,

96
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,440
they are born, they can start walking,

97
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,560
they can start sniffing, many of them.

98
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,240
So when we think about the organism

99
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,200
and sort of the hard-wired level of the instinct,

100
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,400
for many animals, these instincts are sufficient

101
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,000
for them to exist in a world, in their world,

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,360
from the moment of birth.

103
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
But for humans, this is not the case.

104
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,240
Our instincts, all the things that we are born with

105
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,040
instinctually are completely insufficient

106
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,200
for our survival in the beginning.

107
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,360
A baby cannot do anything, basically.

108
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,440
And without the caretaker,

109
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,840
there will not be any chance for survival.

110
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,920
So we say that the baby is in the womb, let's say.

111
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,920
The baby has a need and these needs are answered.

112
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,840
But as soon as the baby is born, it might be hungry,

113
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,360
it might be, I don't know, it might need a diaper change,

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,880
but this does not happen automatically, immediately.

115
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,240
So we say that after birth,

116
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,440
there is necessarily a certain lack

117
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,880
that is presented in the child's libidinal economy.

118
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,000
Something is needed, but it's not satisfied.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,680
Let's say, mom is at the toilet, dad is not here,

120
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,200
the child is hungry.

121
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,480
Now the child is not fed immediately.

122
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,960
What the child has to do is to take on itself

123
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,440
a certain representation that is linguistic

124
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,560
and address it to another person.

125
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,520
So this is the cry, the baby cries

126
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,520
and then the parent starts to guess what is at stake

127
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,600
and then maybe the baby is fed.

128
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
But what you see here is the fact

129
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,800
that language is necessary in order to,

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
let's say, compensate for this inherent

131
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,800
born gap between the level of the instinct

132
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,720
and the world for the human baby.

133
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Humans are born into a reality where our instincts

134
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,880
and our, let's say, reality, our human reality,

135
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,880
the humanized world are in a complete separation.

136
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,760
There's a schism.

137
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,600
And the only way to connect them

138
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,920
to gain access to this world is by addressing an other,

139
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,200
using a language that is not mine.

140
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,760
This language is used to inscribe something

141
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,960
in this gap between the instinctual level

142
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,760
and the humanized world.

143
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,480
And let's say this inscription

144
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,560
and the way that languages use to inscribe

145
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,280
is what we might identify in the clinic

146
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,600
as a clinical structure.

147
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,640
So everyone relies on language to attempt to compensate

148
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,760
for an inherent gap, an inherent schism,

149
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,000
inherent split in every human's existence.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,760
And we use language in different ways

151
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,560
in order to compensate for it.

152
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,120
No one is able to bridge this gap.

153
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,440
There is no one that lives in nirvana, sadly,

154
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,720
in a place where it is true.

155
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,600
The inner world and the environment are in complete

156
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,480
unicity.

157
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,240
There is no such thing only in our fantasies.

158
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,600
So everyone uses language in a different way to do it.

159
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,080
And what Freud was identifying,

160
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,640
I think in his beginning on his work,

161
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,200
is these particular ways

162
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,960
that people use language in order to compensate.

163
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,080
And he was saying, look at this,

164
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,920
this is the neurotic way to compensate

165
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,040
for this inherent schism in human existence.

166
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,240
This is the psychotic way

167
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,360
to compensate for this inherent schism.

168
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,680
And what I argue in my book is that there is an autistic way

169
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,600
to compensate for this inherent schism.

170
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,120
I go to great lengths to describe it

171
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,160
because I think it is very different

172
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,440
from the neurotic and psychotic way.

173
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,400
And I say that it is different to such an extent

174
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,400
that it necessitates a different clinical approach.

175
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,920
And this is why I say that autism is distinct,

176
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,440
is a distinct structure.

177
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,400
Because I'm basically saying,

178
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,280
when we work with particular subjects

179
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,840
that compensate for this schism using language

180
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,480
in a particular way,

181
