0	5520	Speaking of David, I would like to revisit the the agony of heroes because this is certainly I
5520	10720	think but I think it's the same for you burnout and agony of heroes are my favorite. I've only read
11360	18160	probably four or five of his books. So I certainly love this book. One point I want to make about
18160	21120	the the agony of heroes and I don't know what your thoughts on this are.
23520	28560	So we talk a lot about this like the other and how the other can be a complete alien other and
28560	37680	then they kind of disturb our sameness, our controlled life. But I really like the kind
37680	43120	of the notion that Alan Bajor makes that yes, it's true that the other is completely alien.
43120	50240	You can never plan the love event in that sense. But when when when when two love he says love
50240	56720	takes two and in the event of love by allowing yourself to like opening yourself up to the other
57440	62960	there is a higher truth or a newer truth created. So love becomes a project in that sense. So it's
62960	68560	not that the other is a complete alien and then you know your life is complete chaos. But through
68560	74720	this again it's paradoxically through opening yourself up to this other you in some sense you
74720	81520	find a truth even about yourself. And I'm wondering like I don't know if that makes sense. I'm sorry
81520	85840	if I'm being a bit long winded. No, no, no, no. Just like if you want to comment on that because
85840	91920	for me that's a beautiful idea of like letting ourselves love and opening us up to the other.
93360	100160	Yeah, I think maybe something that you also are you're also expressing in that with that sentiment
100160	110720	is the idea that the other is not just outside that it's an inner inner other too that you
110720	121120	discover about yourself. That this logic of sameness is imposition that we do we also impose it on
121120	129360	ourselves. Like the idea of waking up and planning every minute since the moment you wake up until
129360	134160	the moment optimizing everything. Optimization is really based based on the assumption that I know
134160	143600	myself. I know what I can do and I know what I want to do. But it's a it's a very dull life if I
143600	148880	operate with the assumption that I know everything about myself I know what I'm what I should do.
149520	159840	So yeah, I agree that it's in our relationships that we find aspects of ourselves that we wouldn't
160320	168000	find. A long time ago I had a friend who is a very close friend and in a moment in the
168000	174800	sentimental moment she told me if I don't talk with you for too long I will forget who I am.
176240	182880	And it really made me think I feel I feel like that's a general statement that we could apply
182880	190000	to all good friendships and if we don't get in touch with our good friends we will really lose
190000	195840	touch with ourselves because they they provide us with a place a good friendship or good conversation
195840	203840	it provides provides us with with a place to be to do well get to to to express who we are
204400	212080	and then be responded to and in that dialogue we find something and that part of that
212080	220000	something is is ourselves but it's not the narcissistic self it's the is the other self
221360	227760	if you will. Yeah you know and and how have you found because I was going to read out it's a bit
227760	232400	of a mouthful so let me in fact as the book ends the the agony of heroes and I'm so glad you brought
232400	238240	up your friend because the the part I'm going to read is about friendship uh so Bianca Lan ends
238240	244400	the the book saying the philosopher is a friend a lover here the lover is not an
245040	252640	outward personality uh an empirical circumstance but a presence that is intrinsic to thought
252640	260960	the condition of possibility of thought itself a living category a transcendental lived reality
260960	266880	and this is perhaps my favorite part because this idea of thinking uh thinking in the strong
266880	274480	sense begins with heroes to be able to think one must first have been a friend a lover
275360	283520	without heroes thinking loses all vitality and turmoil and becomes repetitive and reactive
284560	293280	heroes uh infuses thinking with desire for the atopic other so you know and this your friend
293280	299680	said that um she she kind of forgets even who she is unless she's in dialogue with you and I
299680	305680	I'd say I have a lot of friends in my life where I do know if I don't talk to them eventually I
305680	314080	start forgetting even who I am I love that line thank you for reading that to be able to think
314080	324560	one must first have been a friend a lover it's so true and it you know because people who have
324560	330560	an interest in philosophy and have been involved with philosophy for years they might forget that
331200	337840	that it didn't begin with an interest in a given book or a philosophical question
338560	344560	it began as maybe in a context of a relationship with the teacher or with a friend with a person
344560	353600	who seemed very intriguing uh there was friendliness there at the bottom and uh that's why a lot of
353600	360960	times philosophical questions begin with a line of thought with something like uh what is love
360960	367680	what is true love or or you know in some movies characters ask each other can men and women really
367680	372480	be just friends and you know that's you have a relationship with someone and within that within
372480	379120	the context of a relationship friendship those questions are are posed yeah you know but the
379120	385360	engine of those questions is their relationship that's the idea but it's so easy to forget that
385360	388400	and that that itself is also interesting that we forget
