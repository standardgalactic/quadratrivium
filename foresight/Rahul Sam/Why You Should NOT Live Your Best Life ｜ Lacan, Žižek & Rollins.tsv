0	4000	Hey everyone, today I want to make the case as to why you should not live your best life
4000	9120	using the ideas of Jacques Lacourne, Slavoj Zizek, sprinkled in with a bit of the theology of Peter
9120	15040	Orleans. Now firstly, of course, let's try and understand what the thesis I'm trying to negate
15040	21280	here is. What do I mean by living your best life? I think the best way to make sense of this, let's
21280	28880	call it societal, cultural imposition is to go through podcasts that people consume and the books
28880	34400	people read. So if you look at contemporary culture and if you look at, let's say, kind of
34400	41200	consumerist, productivist, moral injunctions, if you look at, let's say, the Amazon bestseller list,
41200	48240	which I have opened right here. I just googled it for this video. You'll see some of the bestselling
48240	53440	books are in the self-help category. Books like Atomic Habits or Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for
53440	58080	Life. And yes, there's some pop fiction, but there certainly are many books that are either in the
58080	65040	personal finance or the self-help category, along with the New Age self-actualization
65600	71760	category books, books like Eckhart Tolle, people like that. And if you look at the top podcasts,
71760	76640	the podcasts like Andrew Huberman's, what's it called, the Huberman Lab podcast, which is
76640	84560	a pretty good podcast on health and well-being, but people certainly obsess over the tips that
84560	92720	Andrew Huberman gives on how to optimize your life, how to optimize your brain or your physiology
92720	99200	and whatnot. And then of course, another example, which probably is a bit more from, even before my
99200	107440	time really, is the book The Secret by, what's her name, the Australian Bern, whoever, Ronda
107440	114160	Bern, right? So this book, just according to Wikipedia, it's sold over 30 million copies worldwide.
114160	118160	That's a lot of copies. And that certainly is a bestseller that there was a documentary about
118160	124560	this book. People still talk about things like the law of attraction and this kind of, I call it
124560	134000	toxic positivity, where the, it seems like in our culture, the imposition, kind of the imposition
134000	143200	by God himself in many ways is to live your best life, to self-actualize, to be as productive as
143200	149360	you can be, to be as healthy as you can be. And not only that, to also in the more of the consumerist
149360	156320	crass, crude sense, to have as much as you want to have, not merely in the sense of just, let's say,
156880	162640	material things like clothes and shoes and cars and watches or whatnot, but even experiences,
162640	167200	travel, experience the world. And of course, we have, you know, terms, colloquial terms like
167200	174320	FOMO, the fear of missing out and whatnot. And all of this comes from this deep seated imposition
174320	180880	that we put onto ourselves, ironically, or rather, physically, I'd say, to live your best life.
181840	188560	And the question is, what does that mean? Why do we always feel guilty for not living our best
188560	193680	life? Why do we always feel guilty for missing out, not just on things that are purely entertaining,
193680	200400	but even on things like self-actualization and becoming divine in some sense and becoming whole
200400	206240	or to use a more technical term? Why do we always have this desire for ontological wholeness?
206240	211600	One way to answer that question is through the ideas of Peter Rollins, who says that we are subjects
211600	217200	of the Achievement Society. Our culture is a culture of self-help and achievement. We
217840	227440	have to live our best lives. The kind of the imperative by God himself, even though most
227440	233840	people in modernity are so-called atheists, is to self-actualize, to live your best life.
233840	238320	And unlike in the past, the categorical imperative to use a content term or simply
239040	245760	what we are ought to do, what we should do was, you know, don't lie, don't shoot, don't murder,
246240	250400	don't commit adultery, all the, you know, typical traditional Christian virtues, let's say.
251360	257360	The categorical imperative of our times, the demands of our times, is to achieve. And that's why
257360	262400	Peter Rollins says we are subjects. We are people living in Achievement Society or Achievement
262400	267040	Culture, because that is ultimately what we're supposed to do, achieve. And if you could take
267040	271440	those ideas of achievement or living your best life, which seem a bit more metaphysical and,
271440	276640	let's say, try and make them a bit more psychoanalytical, the best way to put it is in
276640	280880	Na'a Slavu Žižek's catchphrase, which is enjoy a super ego.
280880	287040	The traditional notion of psychoanalysis is that because of some inner obstacles you internalized,
287040	292640	identified excessively, excessively with paternal or other social prohibitions, you cannot
293360	299920	set yourself free to enjoy, to pleasure is not accessible for you. It is accessible to you only
300000	306560	in pathological forms of feeling guilty and so on. So then the idea is psychoanalysis allows you to
306560	314080	suspend, overcome these internalized prohibitions so that it enables you to enjoy. The problem today
314080	322480	is that the commandment of the ruling ideologies enjoy in different ways. It can be sexual enjoyment,
323440	328800	consumption, commodity enjoyment, up to spiritual enjoyment, realize yourself, whatever. And I think
329360	336240	that the problem today is not how to get rid of your inhibitions and to be able to spontaneously
336240	340800	enjoy. The problem is how to get rid of this injunction to enjoy. Now, before I get to the
340800	345760	negation to keep fleshing this idea out, I'm going to use two books by Slavu Žižek. The first one
345760	351200	is perhaps his most, one of his most accessible books, How to Read Lacan, and the second one is
351200	357120	certainly one of his hardest books to read for they know not what they do. Here's what he says
357120	362480	about super ego or enjoys super ego in How to Read Lacan and after I read from both these books,
362480	368960	I'll kind of explain what he means here. Žižek states, super ego is real, the cruel and insatiable
368960	374880	agency that bombards me with the impossible demands and then mocks my botched attempts to meet them.
375440	382480	The agency in whose eyes I am all the more guilty, the more I try to suppress my sinful
382560	388560	strivings and meet its demands. The cynical old Stalinist motto about the accused at show trials
388560	393600	who profess their innocence, the more innocent they are, the more they deserve to be shot,
393600	399360	is super ego at its purest. For Lacan, super ego has nothing to do with moral conscience as far as
399360	406240	its most obligatory demands are concerned. Super ego is, on the contrary, the anti-ethical agency,
406240	412160	the segmentation of my ethical betrayal. So that except I read is a very, I call that summarized
412400	419600	or called down version of a very perspicacious idea that Žižek has been writing about ever
419600	424960	ever since he's been writing really. The idea that the Lacanian super ego, at least in modernity
424960	430160	in our culture, is quite different to what we would, let's say, conventionally think about the
430160	437440	Freudian super ego, where generally if you ask from any person who has any idea of who Freud is
437440	443760	and you bring up the concept of the super ego, let's say the super ego is this ethical agency,
443760	447440	kind of like the, again, the Kantian categorical imperative that talks about, you know, don't
447440	453520	lie, don't cheat, be a good person, carry out your civic duties, whatnot. Although our culture,
453520	461200	things have shifted. Our super ego is the imperative, as I said many times already, to in fact be
461200	468800	anti-ethical. In fact, to not in a hedonistic sense, to an indulge, indulge, indulge, but rather
469680	476720	it's to the demand itself is to live your best life, as I said in this video. And ironically,
476720	481040	a part of living your best life is certainly being anti-ethical and doing things that are
481040	486320	moral transgressions, so to speak. But also, again, the new age of self actualization and whatnot.
486960	491680	But then comes the important point where he makes the cynical Stalinist joke that
492320	496800	the reality of the super ego demands are that they can never be met. And in fact, the more we
496800	502400	carry them out, the guiltier we feel, the more we engage in self help, the more we engage in
503200	507200	productivity, reading all these books and listening to all these podcasts or the other
507200	512880	side of things, the more consumerist we become, the more we try to experience new things and
512960	520080	constantly pursue novelty, the less emptier and more guilty we feel in the sense that we always
520080	525760	feel we aren't doing enough. And that's the cruel, sadistic nature of the super ego. So that idea
525760	530480	of the super ego demands being unfulfillable brings us to an excerpt from this book for they
530480	536400	know what they do, where initially, before I read the excerpt, Gizek states that as we probably all
536400	543280	kind of intuit at least, we all kind of feel it that in post-modern culture, we have no
543920	551920	moral laws to say. We have no substructure that guides us in how traditional societies did guide
551920	558000	us in the sense that most people are atheistic, we have no metaphysical principles, and we don't
558000	564800	have a lot of prohibitions. Now, of course, the naive way to view that is we think, oh, that means
564800	572480	we can live in infinite bliss and freedom. There isn't all these old patriarchal ways of existence,
572480	579440	we could just be free. It's not so simple. Here's what Gizek states. He states, how do we
579440	585040	account for this paradox that the absence of law universalizes prohibition? There's only one possible
585040	592560	explanation. Enjoyment itself, which we experience as transgression, is in its innermost status something
592560	599360	imposed, ordered, when we enjoy. We never do it spontaneously. We always follow a certain injunction.
600320	606240	The psychoanalytical name for this obscene injunction, for this obscene call, enjoy your super ego.
606240	613360	So here's where all the ideas connect. In the past, the universal law, the Kantian categorical
613360	621040	imperative, was prohibition. Do not do this. Whereas now, in our post-modern culture, it is
621040	626960	you ought to do this. You must do this. You should do this. You must read this many self-help books.
626960	630720	You must listen to all these productivity podcasts. You must take care of your health.
631280	637920	You must focus solely on your well-being and on your health. You must have this much money. You
637920	643280	must own this thing. You must have this experience, so on and so on. You get the point. And of course,
643280	649040	that begs the question, if the current imperative, and we can't detach ourselves from these imperatives
649040	655280	there, there, regardless of whether we like them or not, how do we live our best life? Unfortunately,
655280	659200	here's where things get a bit dark. It's impossible. It's primarily due to reasons,
659200	664880	because firstly, we don't really want to live our best life. What we want to do is to fantasize
664880	670560	about living our best life, but never really live it. You have a serious ideological deviation at the
670560	676800	very beginning of famous proclamation of independence, you know, pursuit of happiness.
676880	684480	If there is a point in psychoanalysis, it is that people do not really want or desire happiness.
684480	690000	And I think it's good that it is like that. For example, let's be serious. When you are in a
690000	696160	creative endeavor in that wonderful fever, my God, I'm on to somethings and so on, happiness
696160	701680	doesn't enter it. You are ready to suffer. Sometimes scientists, I read history of quantum
701680	707600	physics or earlier of radiation, were even ready to take into account the possibility that they will
707600	713040	die because of some radiation and so on. You know, happiness is for me an unethical category.
713040	723040	And also, we don't really want to get what we think that we want. The classical story that I like,
723040	729200	the traditional Meyshovinist scenario. I am married to a wife, relations with her are cold,
729200	734240	and I have a mistress. And all the time, I dream, oh my God, if my wife were to disappear,
734240	740800	I'm not a murderer. But let us say, drop me, it would open up new life for me with the mistress.
740800	745840	You know what? Every psychoanalyst will tell you quite often happens that then, for some reason,
745840	752800	wife goes away, you lose the mistress also. You thought, this is all I want. When you have it there,
753760	759200	you turn out that it was a much more complex situation where what you want is not really to
759200	765520	live with the mistress, but to keep her as a distance, as an object of desire about which
765520	770880	you dream. And this is not just an excessive situation. I claim that this is how things
770880	776800	function. We don't really want what we think we desire. And of course, manifest and consumerism,
776800	781760	as we all know, the more we shop, the more we buy things and purchase things, the more we want to
781760	787600	shop and buy and purchase things. What we are really looking for is in that case, not a particular
788240	794080	consumable item, not a particular commodity, but rather at a fundamental ontological level,
794080	799680	what we desire is the object, this virtual void that isn't there. But perhaps even more
799680	805520	pertinently to our times, leaving consumerism aside, because it seems rather obvious, it is also
805520	811680	the fact that we never do really want our desire to be ever met. Despite the fact that it's
811760	817760	unfulfillable, regardless, what we want to do is fantasize about this object, about getting
817760	824160	whatever this virtual category is, this empty virtual category is. And perhaps the quintessential
824160	830240	example is something like Paris syndrome, where as we all know, it's a phenomenon where many,
830240	838240	many people, many, many tourists, whoever, they always fantasize about Paris. And once they do
838320	843520	go to Paris, once they do go to France, they see that it's just the brutal reality of what it is
843520	849040	and they see that it's just another stupid country. Of course, what they really were fantasizing about
849040	855600	wasn't Paris the actual material place, rather the object. And I think Gizek puts it best
855600	860080	where he says that, if there's anything psychoanalysis has told us, that is that human beings
860080	865520	fundamentally don't want to be happy or don't want their desires to be met. So to keep expanding
865520	869760	on this idea a bit more theoretically, Todd McGovern elucidates it really well in his book,
869760	875680	Capitalism and Desire, he states, capitalism is the effect of sustaining subjects in a constant
875680	881360	state of desire. As subjects of capitalism, we are constantly on the edge of having our desire
881360	888000	realized, but never reached the point of realization. This has the effect of producing a satisfaction
888000	894640	that we don't recognize as such, that is, capitalist subjects experience satisfaction itself as
894640	901120	dissatisfying, which enables them to simultaneously enjoy themselves and believe wholeheartedly
901120	907200	that a more complete satisfaction exists just around the corner embodied in the newest commodity.
907200	911280	So of course, when McGovern talks about capitalism, he's also talking about the
912080	916560	capitalist ideology, which is the kind of the culture that I'm talking about of living your best
916560	922160	life. And I'm sorry to quote myself here, but a little commentary on what Todd McGovern wrote.
922240	926640	Here's what I wrote. And again, I'm sorry for narcissistically quoting myself.
928080	934320	Since our lack is unfulfillable and our desire is unmeetable, we are the perfect subjects for
934320	940400	capitalist dynamics because paradoxically, capitalism works by not working. We are always
940400	946800	kept on the edge of having our desires met by, in fact, not having them ever met in reality.
946800	954160	So you could replace the word capitalism with new age, with self-help, and the idea would still
954160	960000	apply. And then we come to the other concept, which is perhaps one of Lacan's deepest ideas,
960000	966400	where he famously said, desire full stop is always the desire of the other, which basically means
966400	971920	that we are always asking the other what he desires. And this is where Jujak states in his book,
971920	976640	but even in the video I just showed you, that our desires, what we are supposed to do,
976640	982160	living your best life, whatever it may be, don't come in any authentic, spontaneous sense.
982160	987680	It always comes by the other, which is our sociosymbolic reality of culture, of society,
989040	993760	and it manifests in many ways. It's true, of course, the very conspicuous marketing
994080	1001680	of celebrity culture, but even in more subtle ways, where it could be completely unconscious.
1002800	1006800	Nonetheless, our desires are always coming to us from society.
1006800	1013440	Okay, so it seems like using these Lacanian ideas of psychoanalysis and Jujak's ideas of
1013440	1019520	more cultural analysis, we seem to be in quite a dilemma, given the fact that, firstly,
1020320	1024640	our super ego demands of living your best life can never be met, and the more you try,
1024640	1030560	the guiltier you will feel. And secondly, the fact that you realize that your desire is not
1030560	1035520	some authentic desire of you, of you wanting to live your best life is never what you truly want,
1035520	1041360	but rather it's what society is telling you to want. We seem to be stuck in a rather catch-22.
1041360	1048080	What do we do? What's the solution here? Now, the purpose of this video, like all my videos,
1048080	1052960	is never to give any easy solutions, nor is it to ever, ever, absolutely not give advice,
1052960	1059120	because what the hell do I know? But, at least to end the video on a high note and not in a kind
1059120	1066480	of cynical, defeatist note, I could talk about a few things that Peter Rollins introduces to
1066480	1071520	this conversation. He too was, in fact, influenced heavily by Lacan and Jujak, but his kind of
1071520	1077600	theological understanding of what we can do, given that we, in many ways, need to try and
1077600	1083280	liberate ourselves from this culture of self-help and productivity and living your best life.
1083280	1087360	But before that, before talking about certain things we could do living amidst such a culture
1087360	1092960	and such a social reality, there's a caveat, a very important caveat that I need to put forward,
1093600	1098560	which is you cannot step outside of ideology. Now, I've spoken about ideology quite a lot in
1098560	1104400	this video, and especially post-modern capitalist ideology. Now, we could all think the way the
1104400	1110000	andrate people think, oh, that means now that I know all these things, I could just step outside
1110000	1118480	of ideology and get red-pilled and wake up to the truth. This is to quote Lacan himself,
1118480	1123600	le nom d'oeuvre air, which means those who are not d'oeuvre air most. To think that you can step
1123600	1129520	out of ideology is the most ideological thing you could do. So, whenever someone tells you,
1129520	1134320	here's the reality of our world, here's consumerism, here's all the problems we're facing,
1135760	1142960	come to me, I'll give you the solution that is instantly ideology suspect, because the solution
1142960	1148320	itself is a ideological reality, because we can never step outside of ideology. This is perhaps
1148320	1154160	one of JJ's most original and perspicacious points that the only way to live in such a reality
1154160	1159840	is to understand that ideology itself is our sociosymbolic reality that gives meaning to our
1159840	1166640	lives. So, the only way to live in such a reality is to critique ideology from within,
1166640	1170960	not to think that you can step outside of ideology and to make this argument a bit more
1170960	1178000	metaphysical in the very famous Plato's Cave example. The idea is not that you could step
1178000	1183600	outside of the cave and then see a reality, rather, reality itself presents itself to you
1184160	1188720	through the cave, and the way you understand reality is through critique of ideology, in this
1188720	1193200	case, critique of our social reality. So, with that caveat out of the way, here's one thing
1193200	1198640	Peter Rowland suggests. It is the idea of grace. It's a very Christian concept, of course, and
1199440	1204720	in such a culture, in such a culture of self-help, such a culture of obsession with living your
1204720	1212480	best life. One thing we can struggle to do is, in fact, understand how grace works. Grace is a
1213120	1217840	unearned love, and now you might think that, oh, unearned love, it's great, God's grace,
1217840	1222560	it's fantastic, but no, it's not just saying there's some abstract God out there loving me,
1222560	1228000	but rather learning in your social reality that you have the ability, the space, the freedom,
1228800	1235040	whatever you may call it, to accept love, to accept love from your friends, from your family,
1235680	1244400	and if you believe in God, from God himself, that it's okay to not fall into achievement society
1244400	1251120	and just simply, and to use a very, very cliche term, be the stupid, dumb self you are,
1251920	1257840	and still find love in this world. Find love in however way it may manifest, and this is, in fact,
1258000	1264560	what the radical notion of grace is, because grace, Christian grace particularly, is unearned love,
1264560	1269120	and you might think, oh, again, as I said before, that it's fine, I can enjoy unearned love, but no,
1269840	1277440	keep in mind that in our post-modern society, with all the super ego imperatives of achieving,
1277440	1286000	of doing the best, of getting to the top, of being your best self, receiving anything unearned
1286000	1291040	is a traumatic, even traumatic experience. It is something we struggle a lot to feel
1291040	1296640	loved in this world and to accept love, but if we learn, and that's really important, if we learn
1296640	1306560	how to accept love and to accept grace, I believe to a certain extent, this can help us to live within
1306560	1312960	such an ideological society with our current moral impositions and super ego imperatives.
1313680	1318400	And the second thing is, as much as we learn to receive love, we also learn to give love,
1318400	1324560	and to love others. Now, there are two ways I would put this. I could say, oh, of course,
1324560	1329760	it comes in interpersonal relations, romantic love, loving your friends, loving your family,
1329760	1333360	but I also think, and perhaps it is quite important, given as Aristotle said,
1333360	1338160	we are political animals, and he meant that more in the sense that we are social animals in a
1338160	1343360	social reality, not in this day to day silly, the spectacle of politics, they didn't mean that at
1343360	1350080	all. Given that we are a part of society as much as society is out there, it's also within us,
1350640	1358400	it's learning to understand that it's important to have a vocation, it's important to have an
1358400	1363040	existential project in life, whatever it may be, you could be a writer, you could be a political
1363120	1369680	activist, you could be a scientist, an engineer, an entrepreneur, whatever it may be, it has to be
1369680	1374960	something that's an existential project, not something silly like a careerism or making money,
1374960	1379440	not playing the rat race and falling into the game of capitalism, certainly not, but rather
1379440	1385280	understanding that what you do in this world matters, not only to yourself, but also to others.
1386320	1392240	And I think that in some sense, liberates us from this kind of narcissistic obsession to live your
1392240	1398800	best life and to always sub-actualize. So yeah, that's at least for me what's helped me to understand
1398800	1403760	that I don't have to live my best life, I could be the shitty stupid person I am, but at the same
1403760	1410080	time, learn to love, learn to accept love, but also to find a vocation and to commit myself to that
1410080	1416880	cause, to that vocation, and in fact to go all the way, not to live this kind of tepid life of
1416960	1422240	oh, I've got to meditate five hours a day, have my cold shower, exercise, take all my vitamins and
1422240	1426640	live this perfect, balanced, holistic life, none of that, none of that, to understand that
1427360	1434400	existence itself has an antagonism and chaos to it, and that despite that, despite that chaos,
1434400	1442080	or perhaps through it, I will learn to partake in my vocation, partake in my existential project,
1442080	1448400	while also understanding that the ultimate guiding principle, the impetus behind all of it,
1448400	1455360	is love, and that is why I would say Christian theology, the Christian idea of grace, certainly,
1456320	1461840	I would say, is perhaps most important for our culture than any other culture,
1461840	1467440	when I mean our culture, I mean neoliberal capitalist culture in the times we live in.
