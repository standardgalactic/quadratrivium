1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Firstly, I would say, in my view, self-help is a post-modern phenomenon, and what I mean

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,560
by that is that, which is perhaps why that self-help, as you said, Joanne, it doesn't

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,320
really have, it doesn't question the odds, it doesn't question what's driving us towards

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:26,400
the point B, from A to B. So it's purely focused on the systems. It's like a ruthless pragmatism.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,520
It's just get it done. This is how you get it done. Apply these frameworks. James

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:40,800
Clears Atomic Habits or whatnot. My critique of self-help comes in two ways. Firstly, in a more

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,880
existential sense, and then afterwards, certainly my political critique, where I critique the ideology

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:55,280
of self-help. So the existential one is rather interesting because here's what I put it this

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,040
way. So as you were talking, it reminded me of Camus's quote from the shoot, The Fool. He says,

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,200
sorry, a man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,440
the life are devoted to the earning of that money. Happiness is forgotten. The means are taken for

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,720
the end. So I'll just replace money with self-help there. It'll go like this then. A man wants to

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:29,600
practice self-help in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of the life are devoted

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,600
to the earnings of that money or to the practice of self-help. Happiness is forgotten. The means

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,680
are taken for the end. Now, happiness is forgotten. Again, happiness is not a big deal here, but let's

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,800
assume in the context of this quote, the happiness is an ought. I ought to be happy. It's the B,

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,680
the person's moving towards. So within this, though, what I've seen with self-help is that

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,600
essentially speaking, the means are taken, the means replace the end. The means don't become

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,160
just a means to an end. They become the end in themselves. So what happens is when people get

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,960
obsessed with self-help, all their life, all their life, all they do is try to optimize everything.

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,120
They try to meditate, run cold showers, read myriad self-help books. In fact, I saw this

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,400
really interesting statistic. I can't pull it up now because I got to find it, but it said that

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,000
majority of people who buy, so majority of people that buy self-help commodities, so except for

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,920
products, whatever, courses, books, all that, they're generally a really high number, like 80

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,320
or 90% of it, they're recurring customers. It's the same people that keep buying this stuff.

26
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,320
Because what happens is, I think people get to use a Lacanian term, a sense of Jewish zones,

27
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,360
from just the act of engaging in self-help. I'm going to read 10 self-help books despite all of

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,440
them virtually saying the same thing. It's not that advanced. It's just basic stuff. You don't

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,320
have to be a genius to have habits, be disciplined, have some framework, have a calendar, have a to-do

30
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,480
list. I mean, no shit Sherlock. You don't have to be a genius to know that. But then people get,

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,000
like, you know, what's this, Tiago 40 is a second brain thing where you optimize everything's

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,320
productive. From the processes itself, people find a great sense of pleasure, although I would use a

33
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:35,120
more psychoanalytical term, Jewish zones, where then there's no real, they really aren't really

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,320
doing anything apart from optimizing their lives, apart from self-helping, you know, and that that

35
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,480
becomes a whole lot. And it's kind of a sad existence if you think about it, because like,

36
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,840
there's no creative outlet. There's nothing, there's no creation per se. It's just this like very,

37
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,960
in a peculiar sense, narcissistic obsession with the self. And my question, the way I like

38
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,280
always think is like, I like to think of, for humans, you know, I'm a Hegelian, so we're historical

39
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:10,720
beings, right? Imagine if Napoleon or Churchill spent, you know, six, seven hours a day focused on

40
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,160
self-help. Like imagine Napoleon before he went to, you know, was trying to beat the Nazis, woke up

41
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,120
in the morning, meditated, you know, had the cold shower and did all these things. We would probably

42
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,960
all be speaking German and you and I probably wouldn't even be born. We've probably been some,

43
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,640
our parents would have died in some concentration. One would imagine Napoleon to have been more

44
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,480
effective, but I don't think that would be the case. You would have not stopped reading.

45
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,240
Yeah, you see a self-help ideologue would say, oh, if Napoleon or if Churchill did all these

46
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,960
optimization things, they would be even better at that, whatever they did as leaders, let's say.

47
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:52,640
I disagree. I think the greatness that doesn't come from this very little tweaks, optimization

48
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,040
here and there. It comes from something even beyond what you can articulate. It comes from

49
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,440
to the ancient term from trying to be that ubermunch, you know. So it comes from, in some sense,

50
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,760
the greatness comes from some kind of insanity. There's like a sense of insanity to what they're

51
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:16,240
doing and self-help ruins all of that. It makes you a very tepid vanilla kind of person and that's

52
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,800
why I'm going to be totally honest, man. Most people I talk to who are hyper obsessed with

53
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,680
self-help and I used to be one of these people. So I kind of know a few people who I used to be

54
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,480
a part of a pyramid scheme at MLM. Unfortunately, I got sucked in as a kid. So I still know a few

55
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,960
people who are in that circle. Great people, lovely people. We all do. We all do. Yeah,

56
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,600
everyone did a part of Amway, right? It's just like, I think Bill Clinton was a part of Amway.

57
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,200
So anyway, lovely people, but man, they're so boring. All they do is obsess over like,

58
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,240
focus on your dreams, your goals. I think the interesting thing is they're very,

59
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,680
you can say they're boring, but they're also very obnoxious in a very interesting way.

60
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,240
Oh, I mean, look, okay, I can't speak for being obnoxious because I'm an obnoxious guy.

61
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
No, that's true. That's true. I tend to be this. I tend to be on the top of my head.

62
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,560
Okay, so maybe just what I wanted to mention earlier as well, and you will tie here, it's like

63
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,840
how self-help used to look like was morals, right? It's a lot of morals and ethics,

64
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,240
but then there wasn't the end alone. I would say it's frenesis to use a term by Aristotle.

65
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,320
Frenesis is kind of this like pragmatic wisdom. Very sort of easy system. Frenesis,

66
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,320
which is like a very interesting. I haven't heard of that one. It's like how to engage in the world

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,560
as a virtuous person. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. And I think that's D,

68
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,040
like it's along the lines of how to look it up to self. It's virtue, right? But it's actually,

69
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,120
that's like, in that case, it's not the means becoming the ends. Like I think the means are

70
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,720
still the means and the ends are still the ends, right? Like when you look at it, people in ancient

71
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,600
times, like you, there's no way to parade that you're someone who's, you know, someone who's

72
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,360
thought about all of these things and someone who does all of these routines on the side,

73
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,720
because they're actually operating things. Well, you can only embody it really. I mean,

74
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,600
the only way to be a virtuous person is to embody it. Exactly.

75
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,400
As in the surfer, people can vary. I mean, we all do this. I do this with philosophy, for instance.

76
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,320
It's to use a term by Judith Butler, performativity. Be sure that, look at me, I'm doing all these

77
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:32,400
things. I'm performing the role of what a self-help person would typically do, which is, yeah,

78
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,320
productivity, meditation, all of this. But then that's, it's a bit unfair to say it's just something

79
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,160
self-help people do. I think in postmodern, which is why I said it's a postmodern phenomena,

80
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,320
in postmodern culture, everyone does that. We are all performing something. We are all putting

81
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,480
on a performance, because we live in this kind of groundless existence. Our being has no...

82
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,240
True. But I have one more point to make on the political side. Can I make that point? I'll let

83
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,840
you go. Is that all right? Yeah, yeah, okay. Or do you want to respond, though, to the point?

84
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,480
Actually, maybe I'll go first, because you probably take a while with that one, knowing you.

85
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,840
Oh, no, no, no. This is actually... No, I think I already... Okay. To be honest, the existential

86
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,360
point for me is the important one, because the political one, it's not just self-help.

87
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:26,560
I think it's given our current milieu, ideology, and many things connect to this. But I would put

88
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,240
it simply, I think self-help is also a conformist category, because it's this idea that this connects

89
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,360
to the whole therapist and all the conversations we've been having before. The idea that I'll focus

90
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,760
on myself, don't critique society, the Jordan Peterson thing, clean your room before you criticize

91
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,680
the world, focus on myself, focus on improving, focus on my immediate life, getting my finances

92
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,080
in order, getting my personal life, my personal, whatever health, wealth, whatever in order,

93
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,920
spiritual life, whatever you may call it, and don't critique structures, don't be critical of

94
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,440
neoliberalism, the capitalism, whatnot. So it's the moment one steps into the ideology of self-help,

95
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,920
you already taken on many ideological... There's a lot of ideological baggage that comes along with

96
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,960
it. It's not... So self-help certainly is not a political thing. It's not something that just

97
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,600
exists, again, independently. This is within our culture. So which is why that... Again,

98
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,040
the funny thing is that existentialist critique, I think it perfectly connects to the political

99
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:36,400
critique, because the existential... Essentially, when you replace the means, when the means become

100
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,400
the end, then there's no real end, right? Because it's a postmodern phenomena. The end of... Let's

101
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,560
say, again, we want to create a more just society. We want to create a society where there are less

102
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,160
people suffering, where we want to create a society where there's more love, let's say. We want to

103
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,440
create a society which is perhaps a lot more like what Christ taught us. Now those things matter,

104
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,080
because the end is already there. The end is engaging in the self-help things and not critique

105
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,240
society. So then there's no... It's like this very kind of like... Yeah, it's a slave category.

106
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,480
It's like this tepid existence where you never question society. You kind of live this zombie

107
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,920
existence in many ways, which is really interesting, because if you look at people who are engaging

108
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,400
self-help, you're right. They are rather obnoxious. You think that, man, they're people who are getting

109
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,000
things done. They're so productive. But no, sometimes you should step back and question why

110
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,600
you're doing what you're doing. Doing... Just do it the way Nike says it itself is a

111
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,600
ideological imposition. It's an injunction. Do what? Do what? Do what, man? But that's why

112
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:47,040
I think they're both... There are many existential drawbacks, but certainly there are many political

113
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
drawbacks of self-help pissing, the ideology of self-help.
