00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Hey, everyone. Welcome to this conversation that I had with Professor Iris Berent. It was a riveting,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,680
engaging and fascinating conversation. We discussed some of her work in our blindness to human nature,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,520
how that blindness is innate to human nature itself. We spoke about the twin principles of

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,360
essentialism and dualism, some amazing work she's done on how the kind of the beliefs that

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:32,800
us laypeople have. And I even managed to, in fact, ask her a lot more speculative questions,

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,480
which I really haven't heard her, you know, publicly at least discussed before,

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,000
on qualia and consciousness, and even psychoanalysis and our old mate Freud, and she gave her views

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,680
on those two. Of course, given I'm a neophyte, there were certain parts where I was in too familiar

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,880
with the specifics of her research. So forgive me if I didn't do a good job at engaging a bit more

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,600
with more of her specific points. Nonetheless, you could find most of her papers online on open

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,840
journals. And, well, firstly, a bit of a formal introduction, let's say. Professor Iris Berent

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,720
is a cognitive psychologist at North Eastern University. She's the author of The Phonological

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,840
Mind and the Blind Storyteller, which we discuss rather extensively on the podcast. Her research

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,080
seeks to unveil human nature and our intuitive understanding of it to shed light on human nature.

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,360
She explores the human capacity for language using phonology as a case study.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,880
Saying all that, without further ado, here's my conversation with Professor Iris Berent.

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,080
Firstly, if you don't mind a bit of a personal question, if I'm not mistaken, I believe you

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,760
initially studied miscology and then you sort of transitioned into studying psychology and

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,440
currently your research is more in specifically cognitive psychology. So perhaps you could just

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,600
kind of give us give us a few ideas on as to what you find interesting in this field

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,120
and what made you want to do research in cognitive psychology.

22
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:14,560
So my background is very varied, but to me, it's all a single story that's completely coherent,

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
because I think, you know, it's interesting how you look at your life history and you

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,360
discovered that in retrospect, it was all the same thing. It was all really interesting human

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:33,280
nature. It's really this question of why we know the way we do are the things that we are bound

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,960
to think about, to entertain, are there certain truths we are bound to hold,

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,520
just by virtue of the fact that we have, you know, a human genome, basically.

28
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,360
And that always really, really kind of bugged me. I think it came primarily from reading

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,400
Chomsky very early on when I was really young and it kind of stayed with me for many years.

30
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,240
And at first, this was a question that I explored with respect to music. So

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,440
there the question was, are there some structural properties that are common to all

32
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:19,360
musics, if you will, that we are born with and make us perceive music in a certain way?

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,160
And that was super difficult at the time. So we gradually transitioned into

34
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,000
easier question about language and finally kind of remain more in the domain of human nature

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,240
and itself in the sense of, can we understand our own human nature? And that's where I am right now.

36
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,480
Excellent. Yeah. I mean, before I jump into your book, of course, I kind of want to

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,440
ask a few more general questions. And so you said that it was, well,

38
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,120
initially human nature or understanding human nature, but also reading Chomsky,

39
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,920
which is clear from reading your work. I don't want to call you a Chomsky and that's

40
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,280
like a crass fear of putting it, but it seems like you're settling more on, let's say,

41
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,760
Chomsky side over someone like B.F. Skinner. And so if you don't mind, I would love for you to sort

42
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:22,880
of elucidate this ongoing, I don't want to call it a war, but debate between the Skinner side

43
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,320
and Chomsky side. And in fact, in one podcast, you even said that this debate is still ongoing.

44
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:36,160
It's not like it's done. Yeah, very much so. Nothing changes. Yeah, there's not a conclusion.

45
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
This is the answer sort of thing, which is what's lovely about science in my view.

46
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,800
So what's this debate in linguistics and cognitive science between Chomsky and Skinner?

47
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,920
So that debate at the time was how to explain behavior and generally in linguistic behavior

48
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:04,960
in particular. And Skinner was hoping to explain that in terms of properties of the information

49
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:14,480
that's available to us, what's out there in the environment and responses and the links

50
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,560
between them and associations that we formed between them. And basically the idea is that

51
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,960
to explain how we behave, which is all he cared about, all we need to do is look at the properties

52
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,160
of what's out there rather than what the organism brings internally to that, how the organism views

53
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:44,720
the stimulus and how the organism chooses to response. And what Chomsky made very clear is that

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,840
the study of behavior ought to start with the study of the organism. It's really kind of,

55
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,320
maybe you can think about it as a form of biology, thinking about what is it that the organism brings

56
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:09,120
with themselves to this task. So to make it very concrete. So why is it that you understand

57
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,800
the sentence? How is it that you have a sentence such as John is eager to please? How do you know

58
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:31,680
that it's John who is being pleased whereas if John is easy to please, then sorry, put it the other way

59
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:39,600
around. So if John is easy to please, it is the one who is being pleased is John, whereas if John is

60
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:47,440
eager to please, then he is pleasing Bill or somebody else. And what Chomsky made clear is that

61
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,960
interpretations such like that the only way to make sense of them is to figure out what is it that

62
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,680
the person knows about language and how they encode information that's available to them.

63
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,200
Any pointed out that our ability to do so to encode information that's available to us

64
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:16,560
is constrained in part by innate principles of language that he called Universal Grammar.

65
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,200
And would you say that's sort of something like innate knowledge that you write about in this

66
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:30,960
book? Yeah. So as I read Chomsky, this is primarily a treatise on human nature and about innate

67
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,240
knowledge which he happened to advance in the domain of language, but I always read him as a

68
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,760
philosopher essentially. Certainly. Yeah. I mean, he in fact, I believe he was the, he chaired the

69
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,880
Department of Philosophy at MIT probably for a long time. So he has a really good background

70
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:57,280
in philosophy certainly. Also professor, so with the idea of Universal Grammar, I've always been

71
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:05,120
thinking about that idea like is Universal Grammar itself this type of innate knowledge and is it

72
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:13,840
something that we can sort of study analytically? And empirically. Empirically. Beautiful. And I

73
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,840
would say experimentally. Yeah. So all you need is to start with a good theory of what you think

74
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,560
Universal Grammar is all about and then go to the lab and try to figure out do you have evidence for

75
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,440
this thing and it's not easy, but it's doable. I see. So if you could play a bit of devil's

76
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,560
advocate, because I've read, in fact, apart from Chomsky's political work, of course, I've read

77
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,680
his book On Language, which was an excellent read and I found it quite hard to read as a Neo5,

78
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,720
to be totally honest. But I do know there are certain people still in the field, as you said,

79
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:58,160
it's an ongoing debate that kind of are either critical or disagree with some of Chomsky's ideas,

80
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,840
or let's say values of Universal Grammar. So what are what are the current criticisms of this idea

81
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,440
of innate knowledge or Universal Grammar? So to make it clear, I think that in fact, the majority

82
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:19,200
of the field no longer thinks that no longer sides with Chomsky. I'm not totally convinced in my

83
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:30,000
reading of the evidence that that's right and that's the right conclusion. The debates as I see

84
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:41,200
it in the domain of language have always structured or have always centered on two issues. One is,

85
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,400
what is the machinery that you need to represent language? So what kind of representations that

86
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,440
you have? And what and what and do they are they structured? Are they structured in a systematic

87
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:01,280
way? Do you need something that is akin to algebraic rules? Or all you have is basically

88
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:07,920
associations, very rich set of associations, which apparently this is what GPT is doing,

89
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,200
you know, AI is doing today. So A is what kind of representations do you have? And do you need

90
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:24,720
explicit structure in your data, so to speak? The second question is where these representations

91
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,080
and the rules, the way you operate over these representations, where is all this machinery

92
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,720
coming from? And is it in part specific to language? So are you born with some principles

93
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,080
that are unique to language? And that's what allows you to acquire language? Or are you relying

94
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:50,880
entirely on generic mechanisms that operate across domains? So what is your machinery and

95
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,320
how specific it is, where and where it's coming from? These are have always been the questions.

96
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:11,840
And the debate these days are centered on a whether there are in fact algebraic rules. So this

97
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,400
is huge debate about that, which has been increased and confounded by the rise of AI because

98
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,800
proponents of that state like, look, you have the systems that seem to do just fine. And

99
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,040
it's not clear, but some people, there is a question of whether they in fact have any

100
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,880
algebraic representations at all. And the range of possibilities range between those who say

101
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,160
there aren't any structured representations in there at all, or that maybe they start without them

102
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,720
and they grow them somehow. And all this becomes really difficult to tell just because there is

103
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,560
so much data that these systems are exposed to that it's really hard. So one of the tests that

104
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,200
you know, how do you know that there is an algebraic rules? One of the way to test it is to look at

105
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,360
generalizations. Can you generalize to items that are not similar to anything that you've seen

106
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:17,360
before? But if you basically your data set includes everything that we have, then it becomes very

107
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,920
difficult to know whether you'd in fact generalize or not. So that makes the whole question of

108
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,560
machinery very difficult to decide. Questions of innateness are difficult to decide

109
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:40,880
for two reasons. A, the success of AI that kind of presents a big challenge. The other reason is

110
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,080
often time when you point out that there are universals across languages. So and this is one

111
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:55,680
of the main argument or an important argument to foreign aidness is to argue that, hey, we look at

112
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,440
language of other language and they all show a certain property. So in my work, we looked at

113
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,600
syllable structure and the fact that languages prefer structures such as blog to structures such as

114
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:18,480
all bog, L, B, O, G. That seems very clear. But the thing about this as well as many other

115
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,840
preferences is that there is a correlation between what languages like to do and what the

116
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:32,880
functional pressures of our body dictate. So if I ask my undergraduates why blog, then everybody

117
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:41,920
tells me that. What to say. And then intuitive theory behind it is that it's those functional

118
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,680
pressures, meaning how is it is for you to say that the constraints are you,

119
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:55,680
articulatory system and an addition that they are driving the force. In every area of language

120
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:03,200
universal, in many areas of linguistic universals, you find such correspondences between what languages

121
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,840
like to do and some functional explanation. Phonology is probably the area where you see those things

122
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,240
most clearly, but nowadays people are exploring those ideas elsewhere as well. And the problem is

123
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:25,200
that when people find those correlations, they assume causation, meaning they, if you find any

124
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,800
functional explanation of what's going on, people kind of jump to the conclusion that it's this

125
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,760
functional cause or functional factor that is causing the structure that you see. So in this

126
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,840
specific case, why do you prefer a blog? Because it's easy to say or because it's easy to hear.

127
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:53,920
That's what my undergraduates think. And so do professional scientists. And to me, it's not a

128
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,520
done deal. To me, this is an empirical question that you need to go and explore as indeed we have

129
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,640
and there are ways to do so. So the fact that you find correlation in principle is ambiguous

130
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:15,200
between two explanations. One is it's not language, it's not your G, it's the functional system,

131
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,920
the sensory and motor systems that are driving the cart here. That's what makes language the way it is.

132
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:31,280
But the alternative possibility is, well, maybe it is abstract linguistic principles that

133
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,720
are doing the driving, except for those principles are not entirely crazy. They're not entirely

134
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:46,640
arbitrary, rather they have evolved so that they optimize those sensory and motor pressures,

135
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,720
which I don't think is super surprising. So that predicts that, yes, you will find some correlation

136
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:01,200
between putative UG and those sensory and motor pressures, but what's doing the pushing was

137
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,680
doing what's pushing the cart, so to speak, is UG rather than sensory motor system. And merely

138
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,680
showing a correlation doesn't adjudicate between these possibilities. So in my work, we took it

139
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,680
very seriously. So for example, to figure out whether it's blog that's doing, I'm sorry, whether the

140
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,120
preference for blog is coming from, it's easier for you to say than in collaboration with my

141
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,040
colleague Alvaro Pascualeone, who is a neuroscientist who does transcarnal magnetic stimulation,

142
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,080
what we did is zapped the motor system that controls the articulators, the leaps specifically,

143
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,680
and looked at what this is doing to your linguistic preferences. And conversely,

144
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,400
what happens when you zap Broca's area? And what we found is a dissociation between them.

145
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,680
So the point is, these are questions that you need to explore. You may or may not like the

146
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:03,520
evidence that we produced. I think they're clear, but my point is not to defend the solution, but

147
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,400
rather to defend the method. I am very concerned about that time to jump from correlations to

148
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,680
causation. I think this needs to be sorted out. And I think it's this disagreement that is behind

149
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:23,360
a lot of the ambiguity that we're having in the field right now. I did in fact read a blog post

150
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,680
written on your work from your lab by Northeastern University. And so correct me if I'm wrong, in

151
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:37,760
like a very elementary level, if I could put it this way, is it that you're at the moment claiming

152
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,880
that it's as if these UG or these abstract principles, they aren't physical, they aren't

153
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,200
arbitrary and random, but they've kind of evolved to suit our existence as home sapiens,

154
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,760
the same way let's say a physical limb or something has evolved. Exactly. Yeah, that's the working

155
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:05,920
hypothesis. But again, I think for me, it's more important to tell people that just showing a

156
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,080
correlation isn't necessarily proof. It's not a smoking gun of causation. It's more important for

157
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:21,040
me to emphasize this methodological claim than to push my own interpretation of the data. So I

158
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,920
think that there is probably a lot that need to be done, many more controls and to completely look

159
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,040
at this question. And we have contributed some, but by no means I would argue that we completely

160
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:39,440
resolved the issue. What really bothers me is that the attempt to view the correlation and to jump

161
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,760
to the conclusion that, oh, we know what's going on. I think that's really unfortunate.

162
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,960
I see, as any honorable scientist would say, we need more empiricism, more testing, more

163
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,240
experimentation. Love it. In fact, Professor, maybe this kind of opens the way for us to jump

164
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,760
into a question that I've been fascinated by pretty much all my life and kind of obsessed with.

165
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,920
I'm so glad you mentioned this in your book. So if you don't mind, I'm just going to jump

166
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:15,280
to your book at once here. And this is this question on abstract knowledge and embodied

167
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:22,560
cognition. And I love the part in your book. So if you don't mind me just reading out a small

168
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:30,400
excerpt in page 138 you state in chapter nine that abstraction and embodiment are not mutually

169
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:38,800
exclusive. Cognition could well encompass multiple distinct mechanisms that run according to different

170
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:45,840
computational principles. The conclusion that one mechanism exists does not automatically preclude

171
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:54,080
the other. Again, as I said, I loved what you wrote on this. So this also seems like one of those

172
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,600
ongoing quote unquote wars in the world of cognitive psychology. If you don't mind, please

173
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,520
elucidating and educating us on why you believe that they don't have to be mutually exclusive.

174
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,160
They're not at conflict with each other between abstract knowledge and embodied cognition and

175
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:19,120
what's your current working thesis on these two ideas? So I think why they don't have to be mutually

176
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,840
exclusive is pretty simple. Logically, maybe we should start by talking about what should we

177
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:38,880
clarify what they each mean. Yes, that would be great. So the notion, the so-called classical

178
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,280
view of cognition, which more precisely is known as the computational theory of mind,

179
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:50,960
assume that what's doing the causal work in cognition is algebraic representation that

180
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,160
are structured. So there are symbols and the symbols have form and structure of these symbols that

181
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:07,760
drive mental computations. So for example, if you know that I have a big ball, you know that I have

182
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,200
a ball and that's a property of human cognition. Every time I say I have a big ball, it implies that

183
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:22,160
I have a ball. The goal of cognitive science in this view was to explain what is it about the

184
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:29,840
structure of, what is it about the structure of my representation that not only enables that,

185
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,840
but in fact require that each time you think about a big ball, you imply a ball.

186
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:43,840
And they said, well, you have these complex symbols. Every time you represent the big ball,

187
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:52,400
it's not like a whole complex, it's not an analyzed item for big ball, but rather it has

188
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,960
formal components that correspond to the semantic components. So there's going to be

189
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,360
a representation of your brain that for the ball and for the big, and therefore if you have big

190
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:15,840
ball, it literally implies ball as well because the interpretation of the complex symbol depends

191
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,760
on its part. So that's kind of the computational theory of mind. It's the view of language basically

192
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:29,360
as literally a mechanical system that works on those symbols. And since the symbols have

193
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,920
structure, formal structure, and they have certain meaning, it follows that if you know

194
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,320
the A component of A and B, you must know, if you know A, B, you must know A, for instance.

195
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,440
So all this has to do with the structure for having these abstract symbols and mental representations.

196
00:22:51,440 --> 00:23:02,720
Now, embedded cognition rejects this for the most part. So why is it that your encoding

197
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,400
of concept is not based on this algebraic discrete symbols with this combinatorial structure,

198
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:20,640
but rather by all my experiences with events in the world. So why is it that this ball,

199
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,040
this, you know, battle is blue? What is my concept of a battle? Well, I don't have any

200
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:33,840
abstract symbol in my brain. It's how this battle feels. It's how it's how cold it is and how

201
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,560
shiny it is and how round it is in my hand. And if I didn't have a hand, I would not have the same

202
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:47,280
concept of the battle because my physical interaction with the battle forms part of what I

203
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,760
understand as a battle. So this is the notion of embedded cognition. It's really

204
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,240
embodiment. It's the interaction of my body below my brain with the world that

205
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,240
dictates my understanding of it. In principle, you could have both, right? You can have a rich

206
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,360
sense of sensory-motor interactions and symbolic machinery. And, you know, you can encode them in

207
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:22,480
both and encode the world in both ways. But proponents, many proponents of embedded cognition

208
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,520
take the strong position that not only you have it, but you only have it. So you don't need,

209
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,200
so all this business of structured representations, the computational theory of mine is completely

210
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,960
baloney. You don't need it. You can explain everything in terms of these sensory-motor

211
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,960
interactions. And when stated in this way, I think this is an empirical claim that, again,

212
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,760
you can test. So as we said before, if your understanding of phonology was entirely dependent

213
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,360
on the motor system, then breaking the motor system, disrupting it, say by TMS, or to have

214
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,440
disrupted your understanding of language. And it doesn't look like it's the case. Only it doesn't

215
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,280
completely eliminate your understanding of phonology, which is an area that should be

216
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,600
very strongly dependent on the motor system. So I'm not arguing against the motor theory.

217
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,640
And in fact, there are certainly other aspects, low-level aspects of speech perception,

218
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,120
such as how do you tell Bach from Pa, where there's very strong evidence that you rely on

219
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,280
embodiment. So I think I jump to this notion of motor simulation.

220
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:44,400
Part of what this embodied cognition theory is saying is that not only what you know consists

221
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,760
of these sensory and motor interactions, but in order for you to conceive of a notion,

222
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:58,480
you need to simulate what it would be for you to act on this in a particular way. So for me to

223
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,560
think of battle, I need to simulate what it would be for me from my hand to grab the battle and how

224
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:13,600
it would feel and so forth. And this is an empirical claim. So you can see whether, so as I started

225
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,680
saying, sorry, at the low levels of cognition, there is evidence that indeed such simulations

226
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:26,400
take place. So what we have found and many other people have found is that when you hear the sound

227
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:33,600
Ba, you enact the lip motor area of the brain that control the lips. And therefore, if you're going

228
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:41,120
to disrupt it, you're going to selectively impair your ability to say, perceive the sound Ba and not

229
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,880
the sound Ta, which involves the tongue. So evidence like that suggests that, yes, there is

230
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:56,000
embodiment and there is motor simulation just as this view predicts. So the view is not incorrect

231
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,800
categorically. What seems to me incorrect is the strong claim that this is sufficient to get

232
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:13,520
language off the ground at all levels. And then if we, so how then, how do you propose then that

233
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,640
these, both of these can kind of, let's say, you said, yes, logically, they could coexist.

234
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:27,440
But what would be an example when you say that embodied cognition on its own can't explain how

235
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,240
languages form? So the example that I gave you came from this case of syllable structure. So

236
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,680
we asked, why do you prefer a blog to a blog across languages, which does seem to be the case.

237
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,120
In fact, it's not just these two structures. There is a whole hierarchy there that certain

238
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,080
syllables are better than others and those are better than others and so forth. So it's a complex

239
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,120
hierarchy there. And the question is, is it that because the good guys are easy to say,

240
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:06,880
and the bad guys are hard to say. And embodied cognition predicts that that should matter even

241
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:15,200
if the task at hand is just to listen. So even if all I'm asking you is listen to blah, tell me if

242
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:22,880
it has one syllable or two. You're not supposed to say anything. And yet, according to embodied

243
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:30,320
cognition, for you to just hear it, you need to simulate what it would be for you to say it.

244
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,320
So if this thing is presumably easy to say, you should be accurate. If it's hard to say,

245
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:43,840
it's you should be less accurate. But critically, this ability to say, to literally control the

246
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:52,080
motor program of, in this case, you lips is going to be causal, play a causal role in your ability

247
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,320
to perceive it such that if you can do that, if you can move your lips, you should not be able

248
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:05,840
to perceive it properly, to hear it properly. So perceiving depend on acting, perceiving

249
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:16,080
and perception and action are intimately linked together. And that predicts that if we would not

250
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:25,120
enable you, if we disable the motor system, then perception of language structure ought to be

251
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,920
impaired. So if language structure is all about this simulation and how easy it is to compute,

252
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,280
then if there's no simulation, you shouldn't care about language structure. You should know

253
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:42,080
no evidence that you are sensitive to that. And that's not at all what we found.

254
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:49,760
I see. And that's where you would say, okay, there's some kind of, let's call it UG or abstract

255
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:58,640
knowledge that does still allow us to. So abstraction and UG are not synonyms. From this,

256
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,840
all you can conclude is whatever you know is not just the result of motor simulation,

257
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,080
whether or not it's universal is a separate question that we have explored elsewhere.

258
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,040
But it tells you something about the role of abstraction, which is further strengthened

259
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:25,120
by the fact that in the second paper in this series that came last fall, if I remember,

260
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,160
what we did is simultaneously in the same participants looked at both how they respond to,

261
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:40,240
how they identify simple sounds like bah versus bah, so very low level properties versus how they

262
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:47,200
look at syllable structure. And what we found is, yes, the lip motor area, this motor simulation

263
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,160
business certainly plays a role in low level perception just everybody else thought. It's

264
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,840
specifically in the syllable hierarchy that we didn't find in language structure, namely,

265
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,160
that we didn't find a role. So that's the selectivity really suggests to us, whereas

266
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,760
rockers area did play a role. So this double dissociation as it's called technically suggests

267
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,880
to us that you might need both. Excellent. Yeah, you truly are a bona fide scientist,

268
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,320
Professor, because I tried to jump across and kind of conclude that the your experiment on

269
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,760
embodied cognition probably means we kind of, we need abstract knowledge too, but then you claim

270
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,560
that no, no, what that really says is that it falsifies the theory that all we need is abstract,

271
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,880
sorry, embodied cognition. So I'm glad he clarified that. So just to clarify again,

272
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,280
what they the experiments show is that you need abstraction, they don't necessarily show you

273
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:55,440
need the neediness. I see, I see. I understood. Yeah. Okay, so again, I'm going to jump back to

274
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,000
like a vague more and more like a naive question. Clearly, you probably can see that I'm still a

275
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,360
neophyte. I'm still getting my hang around this field. But great question so far. Oh, thank you

276
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:15,200
very much. I appreciate it. But I guess this is, I don't even know whether this is an unfair

277
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,920
question to ask, because this is pretty much a question we've been trying to answer since

278
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,120
time immemorial really. What is unique about human language?

279
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,120
We don't know for sure. Again, like everything else, it's an empirical question, but we have some

280
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:43,360
clues. So people so so I think we need to distinguish between two questions.

281
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:50,000
Is this a definition to the notion of natural language? So is natural language

282
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,200
a kind in the sense that there is something that defines all languages? So English and French and

283
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,600
Swahili and Mandarin, is there something that's common to all of them? And the second is, is it

284
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:09,120
unique to them? So is it only defining these languages and not other systems?

285
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,360
Right, so that there are different questions at hand. You can look for those characteristics at

286
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:25,200
two levels. One is to ask, are there some, as the linguist Charles Hockett said, are there some

287
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:34,960
design principles that are shared across all languages? And you can then look at more intricate

288
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,360
aspects of language structure. And that's really what Universal Grammar is asking. This is really

289
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,560
a question of, is there something that defines human languages as such, because they're all

290
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,920
molded by the same cookie cutter, so to speak, but the same by Universal Grammar.

291
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:58,720
We talked about Universal Grammar, and I see some evidence for the possibility that maybe it plays

292
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,680
a role, although, as we had discussed, this is only open to discussion and debate in the field.

293
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:14,640
With respect to design properties, so the linguist Hockett came with all these design

294
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:22,960
principles of language, and the fact that all languages have meaning, and they talk about

295
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,440
things that are not here and now, and so forth, but many of those things are also shared with other

296
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,080
systems of non-human animals, for instance. There is one component, though, that seems to be

297
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:42,160
one design principle that seems to be unique to language, and that is this notion that is called

298
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:53,920
duality of patterning, and that is, so it's kind of the double helix of language, so to speak,

299
00:34:53,920 --> 00:35:00,080
in the sense that language has patterns, so the whole point about language is that it's not just,

300
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:06,880
you don't just memorize and analyze whole, but rather there are patterns with structure,

301
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,760
but those patterns exist in two levels. The one level that everybody is aware of is syntax,

302
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,680
so if I say the dog, you know, dogs bite men, or men bite dogs, it gets you completely different

303
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:27,040
meaning, which means that, in this case, the syntactic organization matters, and if you change it,

304
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:35,120
you change meaning. So that is this area in which you take, to simplify, you take words,

305
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,840
which have meaning, and how you order them, how you pattern them makes a difference.

306
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:52,240
This is one level, but there is a second level, which is every such word is not an atom, but rather

307
00:35:52,240 --> 00:36:02,000
it's a molecule that is further constructed from meaningless elements, so if I say dog,

308
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:09,680
you get the dog, one combination of those sounds, you get one meaning, if I say dog, you get a

309
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,200
different, completely different meaning, right? So the ordering, there is pattern, that's the

310
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,640
fact that when you change the ordering, you change the significance of this, of the sequence, means

311
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,320
that the patterning matters, but this is not a pattern of meaningful units, but rather of

312
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:36,400
meaning less units. In spoken language, those elements are sounds, are phonies, but you can

313
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:43,760
also have other types of meaningless elements in sign languages, so there are head movements,

314
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,800
hand shapes, and so forth, but they too are meaningless elements. So it turns out that

315
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,880
every human language has this trick, every human language has these two levels of patterning, and

316
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm not aware of any exception to this rule. We are not aware of any system of animal communication

317
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:14,480
that has this trick, so animals can communicate in very complex ways, they even have rules,

318
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:24,560
so animal communication is great, but the design is different to ours, it's not a value statement

319
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,120
of which one is better and which one is worse, it's different. We have this double layer of

320
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:37,120
patterning and we are not, we are yet to find an animal that has that, so I think that's such

321
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:43,920
as something that's unique to human. But again, the field is very much divided as to whether there

322
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,560
is anything beyond that, in fact it defines language, that is unique to language and whether

323
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:58,080
it's specific to language and this debate is ongoing. Yeah, and of course, I'm assuming this opens

324
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:05,040
up many other avenues such as if you want to create an agent, let's say an AI agent, that engages in

325
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,320
language the way humans do, we need to understand first of all what our design principles are,

326
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:17,120
to even build something. Well, this is where we get to the Skinner-Chomsky debate, right, because

327
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:25,600
the AI, the current AI view, takes the view of let this all emerge, if you feed it enough data and

328
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:33,520
you have a very good learning algorithm, the system will figure it out and we don't know what is it

329
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:45,440
that it figures out. Something it figures out and this is really open to a big debate right now.

330
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:52,240
In fact, I heard Chomsky, which is unbelievable, he's in his I think late 90s and he's still doing

331
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:01,120
interviews and podcasts, truly. He was saying that with LLMs, that yes, marvelous engineering

332
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,560
tools, but he disagrees with the kind of the notion that as you said, if you just keep feeding it more

333
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:13,520
data in like a black box kind of way, eventually we'll have some sort of AI, let's say an AI agent

334
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,920
that engages the language the way we do. I think his concern is what does it really tell you,

335
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,520
so it's a piece of engineering, but what kind of explanation does it give you about

336
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,960
what is the cause of every child speaking a language, so obviously children are not exposed

337
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:40,960
to this massive data, so what it's giving you is kind of, it's mimicking the ability of a child

338
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,480
to form sentences, but it's not clear that it's doing it in any way that is remotely

339
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:54,240
similar to what the child is doing and so doing this does not provide an explanation

340
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:01,360
of how human language actually works. I agree with this concern, so again, this is getting to

341
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,680
this notion of to what extent do we need to worry about what human beings bring with them

342
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,160
to the learning acquisition task as organisms, so to what extent do you need to look at the organism

343
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:21,120
as opposed to assuming it's all out there in the data, so the AI answer is it's mostly out there,

344
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:28,800
we need to just find a good way to milk it and Chomsky's approach was to start from the inside

345
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:38,160
and it remains in a huge debate to be determined. Yes, certainly and sometimes even a contentious

346
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:46,560
one, so the other bit is and what I love about the book is this is also in a way sort of like a

347
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:54,640
book on social psychology because it's a lot on what laypeople believe and in fact being a layperson

348
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:02,880
myself I kind of had this belief too for the longest time which is I always equated what we

349
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:11,120
call human language to reading and in the the blind story teller you state in page 203 if you

350
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:16,640
don't mind me reading it you say many people think of reading as a process of visual pattern

351
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,880
recognition for example being able to consistently register the contrast between symmetrical letters

352
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:30,400
such as D and B if that is the case then it stands to reason that when reading goes ory the

353
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:37,920
culprit is a visual deficit but but in reality visual patterns are just a means to an end which

354
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,200
is language, reading is a technology that gets you there, so professor if you could delineate what

355
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:51,360
the difference between reading and languages that that would be great please. So there are two

356
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,680
things we need to explain what is reading and how it differs from language yes so the true theory

357
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,840
what is the true science about and the second is what people think how this all works so there is

358
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,800
that scientific theory and there is the intuitive theory which happens to be in disagreement and

359
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:16,000
that's where we mess things up so um so there is a sense in which reading is very different from

360
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,320
language I often start my psychology of language classes by working really hard to

361
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,480
disabuse people of the notion that language and reading are the same thing they aren't

362
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,800
language is natural you take every child they will develop language if you don't expose them

363
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,440
to language they will grow one naturally even they're not exposed to a language they do it

364
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:46,640
naturally they don't need language lessons reading is not like that so most children if you don't

365
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,120
teach them how to read explicitly they will never read there are tons of societies that

366
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,880
are doing just well without reading and writing not so for language so language is

367
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,680
universal to all human societies reading is not so they're divorced in this sense for sure

368
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:14,160
nonetheless there is this interesting property of human brains that the neuroscientist Stanislaw

369
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:21,920
Dahan has pointed out which is when human brains come to invent a new system they don't

370
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:30,240
invent it completely an you but rather what they do is recycle existing systems that are innate

371
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:37,920
and kind of repurpose them for the new for this new purpose and the link between reading and language

372
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:46,960
exactly follows those lines so when you look at how reading systems are designed they could have been

373
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,400
completely divorced from language they could have been completely arbitrary but that's not the case

374
00:43:52,400 --> 00:44:00,080
because the letters that we use for a system like a phobetic system like English correspond to

375
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:10,320
linguistic sounds for the most part even in writing systems as in Mandarin it's true that there are

376
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:16,960
visual origins of the symbols that they call they also have some banding component but eventually

377
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,360
what they stand up for is also phonological sounds they spend they they stand for syllables

378
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:31,760
so it turns out that when people come to invent language they kind of design it on the principles

379
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:39,760
of how language works you can think about it in terms of human brains when they start processing

380
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,360
language they start with the phonology and then so when you perceive speech that the first thing

381
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:51,600
that you get is the sound structure of language and from there you proceed to syntax and so forth

382
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:58,080
so it's like to go on the linguistic highway so to speak in the brain you need to start by having

383
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:06,000
some phonological code so if you're trying to hijack the same highway to create reading you

384
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,360
better start by doing by encoding phonology as well and that's how explain the correspondence

385
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:20,160
between how reading works and how language works reading as a system is taking the language or

386
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:31,360
hijacking a component of the language system and repurposing it for a new technology and that is why

387
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,760
all reading systems that we know encode some phonological units at some level it doesn't

388
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,600
necessarily need to be at the level of phonemes it could be syllables but there is also some

389
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:51,440
phonological component there is ton of research that shows that when you and I read well I'm not

390
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,760
an atheist speaker but when I read in my language and you read in your language even though we read

391
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:05,360
silently we will automatically extract all this phonological component as integral part of the

392
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,800
reading process so you think about reading as a visual affair it's something that happens only

393
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:18,960
in your eyes of course it begins with the eyes but it looks like it invariably goes through the

394
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:27,440
phonological system at some point or else reading does not work as it should so you must get some

395
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,800
aspects of the phonology of what you read how do we know that because if you get two words that have

396
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:41,680
the same phonology such as rose the flower and roses in two rows of you know chairs people confuse

397
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:48,800
them all the time even if you'll have ROZE which is not the word people will also confuse them

398
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,840
and using the proper experiments you can show that it's really the phonology that that confuses

399
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:03,120
them which shows that people have consulted this information or else they would not have

400
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:12,960
been confused so the point about showing how we stumble is to show how reading actually works

401
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,680
and the fact that it actually works is using phonology it's using this part of language

402
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:25,360
so that's the real theory of reading and we also know that when you know that the ability to perceive

403
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,840
sounds is so it's not just phonology but also speech when the ability to perceive speech sounds is

404
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:38,000
impaired this is a characteristic of dyslexia so people with dyslexia have problems with

405
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:46,320
perceiving speech sounds now that's not what lay people think so if you ask a lay person

406
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,600
you know johnny can't read here you know he's a six-year-old and he can't read what do you think

407
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:59,040
is wrong with him and invariably people tell you there is something that's wrong with their eyes

408
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:04,880
and if they think that there is something that's wrong with billy because of jimmy what are ratios

409
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,880
that if the problem is congenital which we know that's the case in dyslexia that it is a congenital

410
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:19,840
disorder people invariably think the problem can only be in the eyes it can't be the

411
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:31,760
abstract phonological thing and this arises from this intuition that people hold that what's

412
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,280
we hold innately so if you know that the problem is congenital that he was born with that then it

413
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:44,320
must be somewhere in their body the people don't think just genes they think like in the eyes in

414
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:50,800
the ears it can be something that is abstract that doesn't make sense that the ability to so what

415
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:57,200
dyslexia really is about is in part the mechanism that allow you to map letters to sound and which

416
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,280
is an abstract kind of cognitive mechanism and people have trouble recognizing that something

417
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:13,760
like that could possibly be involved or or or impaired innately so this is unfortunate because

418
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:22,560
it's first because people misunderstand what dyslexia is all about and and that's a problem because

419
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:29,360
if you think that you know if you have a child and you think that the only signal of dyslexia is

420
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:37,840
switching letters then you will find fail to identify and and help these children early as

421
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:44,880
they need to as you need to but indirectly it also tells you some something about how we think

422
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:51,760
about what is innate and what is inateness and and explain some of the other biases that

423
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:02,160
I've shown in this book that show how our misconception about what about how what what is innate

424
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:09,920
lead us to this crazy conclusion that what we know cannot possibly have an innate basis

425
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:17,520
yeah and of course this probably leads us to your twin principles the twin principles of

426
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,000
essentialism and dualism now I know you've spoken about this professor in many podcasts

427
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,840
but I still want to ask because it's a fascinating idea well to put it simply sorry you claim that

428
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:38,480
our blindness to human nature is rooted in human nature itself sorry I'm very bitter for cough

429
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:47,760
so firstly I'm wondering uh as in could you kind of you know like uh flesh out what that statement

430
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,160
means by the fact that that our blindness to human nature is sort of innate to it's it's sort of a

431
00:50:54,160 --> 00:51:00,400
part of being human itself and then maybe from there develop the ideas of essentialism and dualism

432
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:11,200
sure so maybe let's start with with the background so upper so first the first thing to show is that

433
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:20,000
people are blind to human nature it is a thing which people may not necessarily accept because

434
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:31,760
um so many people so you know assume that when a child is born that newborns know nothing about

435
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,520
the world that they have no abstract concepts whatsoever that there is no possibility that

436
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,520
they would know for example what is an object or that they will have a notion of number

437
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:54,400
or they will have even a rudimentary notion of um good versus bad in in very basic form

438
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,520
and we know because we ask these questions and it turns out that it's not the case that people

439
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:09,040
simply think that nothing is innate so if you ask them well do newborns prefer happy faces to angry

440
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:15,280
faces um they'll tell you sure yeah of course they do that's actually wrong they don't so when the

441
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:22,240
experiments have been done there's no preferences for the happy face but when you ask them well will

442
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,200
a newborn infants understand that three sounds and three lights share something in common this

443
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:36,480
thing from say three and nine three seven three and nine lights and they'll look at you like what

444
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,600
and even though when you know you can explain how this can be done so you can these experiments

445
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,880
have been done in in fact and you can give people the exact description of how the experiment was

446
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,800
done and ask them to make a prediction so this is how we can study that and here here is how the

447
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,720
experiment was designed now tell us what will the infants do if they appreciate this fact and

448
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,920
they'll tell you there's no way that they they will do so and that is wrong because the experiments

449
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,520
have been done and newborn infants can appreciate abstract number in the sense as well as they have

450
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:20,400
a concept of object and so forth um so there is a problem here right because uh science tells us

451
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:26,080
that there is stuff that infants know and there are good reasons to think that this knowledge is

452
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:33,280
innate a because it's very difficult to explain how this can be uh uh learned from the experience

453
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:39,600
that's available to the infant in utero and second because you see it in other animals so in many of

454
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:46,080
these experiments there are parallel demonstrations in human and non-human animals say in chicks and

455
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:52,080
you find similar things and this evolutionary continuity gives you further um room to to believe

456
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:59,280
that this knowledge can be innate and yet we don't accept it right so when you ask lay people they

457
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,440
uh they cannot conceive of the possibility that knowledge can be innate they even kind of look

458
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,200
at you like this is really the very proposition seems to me less to them as as an oxymoron

459
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:19,520
so the question is why that's the case uh where this bias to innate knowledge comes from now

460
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:28,960
there can be many reasons that doesn't need to be a single answer so um but and and there have

461
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,560
been other proposals in the literature such as perhaps you have a lot of experience with learning

462
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:40,240
but yet you know you can learn also motor actions you can learn how to swim so why is it knowledge

463
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:47,520
specifically that you have trouble with um maybe it is you're worried about the social implications

464
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:53,440
right so if we're innately the way we are then if maybe we're different and that that's a concern

465
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:01,600
what it fails to explain is why is it knowledge specifically that that gets us exercise right

466
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:07,840
if it's we're worried that uh about social discrimination why does the notion of object

467
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:16,480
is a problem very hard to see what social relevance it has so here is my proposal

468
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:26,080
um the proposal is that this bias arises from two intuitive principles

469
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:37,120
you know that are based on innate principles so whether or not these two guys that i'll explain

470
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:42,640
are in fact innate or not is less clear but the roots certainly are so let me explain what

471
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:50,320
i'm talking about so there's one in each of the so the two kind of partners in crime and one is

472
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,840
called intuitive essentialism and the other is called intuitive dualism and there's lots of literature

473
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:02,880
that shows that each of them matters as we think intuitive essentialism governs how we think about

474
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:10,400
what's innate so when children think about what makes an animal look the way it does why does it

475
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,560
have a tail why does it have this color they're telling you there is something in insides the

476
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:22,960
animal that makes it what it is inside it body so that the notion is that there is this essence

477
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:32,960
that doesn't change it lives in your inside and it's in the body okay the problem is that people

478
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:40,320
will also think about knowledge that as if it's not in the body people think about the

479
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:45,360
knowledge as it's something that's in the mind as if the mind is ethereal and distinct from the

480
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:51,440
body so there are intuitive dualists this is completely under the hood it's not something

481
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:58,000
that it's not a doctrine they're not philosophers but even if you ask children beautiful work by

482
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:05,200
just say burying by other people who show that children think about the mind as a

483
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:13,600
ethereal distinct from the body and knowledge it lives in the mind not in the body here's the

484
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:19,120
problem right if you think about knowledge such as your understanding of number as it's not in the

485
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:25,520
body and if you think that everything that's innate must be in the body it follows that

486
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,760
knowledge cannot be innate because it's in the wrong place right here is the body here is the

487
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,360
mind there is my knowledge there is what's innate and you know that's in the wrong place it can't be

488
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:48,000
innate and this is how the bias we think arises so what I've told you so far is how our troubles

489
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,520
with the innateness arise from these intuitive principles but then where do these principles

490
00:57:53,520 --> 00:58:03,440
come from right how to tell essentialism in both cases those are principles that are observed across

491
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:10,560
cultures even when what children for example believe is different from what they're adults so

492
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:18,800
the anthropologist Rita Stutte has done really beautiful work that shows that children in

493
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:28,160
Madagascar in a small community there they the adults talk about you know why is that a person

494
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:34,880
has something wrong with their leg well some their mother talked ill of some person and they cursed her

495
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:43,280
and that's how you know that's affected so this is this a very market view of not evolution but

496
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,600
basically you bodily traits are acquired through social transmission

497
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:58,800
so when you do the same experiments with children in this place they do show evidence that they

498
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:04,560
understand essence so they think that if you have two animals and one is the biological

499
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:11,680
offspring of the other what's true of the father will be true of the son rather than an adoptive

500
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,880
and it won't get what it gets its biology from the biological parent not from an adopting parent

501
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,920
so that's a just to us so essentialism is not something that's innate in the sense that you'd

502
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:32,880
see it in in in very young infants although it has some roots very early on but it seems to do

503
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:40,480
something that we just develop naturally for whatever reason you see the same for with dualism

504
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:46,720
extremely prevalent across cultures believing afterlife and the supernatural and and of course

505
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:54,880
religion and all this stuff you find it very very broadly across cultures even in cultures that do

506
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:04,560
not tend to speak about those things openly why that's the case was never clear a problem has

507
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:12,800
long suggested the the psychologist problem has suggested that maybe intuitive dualism

508
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:18,880
arises from core knowledge so what is core knowledge core knowledge are those innate systems

509
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:30,480
that infants are born with and two of those systems are critical here and one system guides

510
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,760
how we think about people and another guides how we think about objects and these two systems are

511
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:42,960
in contrast with each other and because of this contrast that's what leads to dualism

512
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:51,200
so the idea is that so so basically the way it works is you think about

513
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,720
objects behave what makes the object don't move on their own they can only move if there is a

514
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:02,400
physical contact between objects people can move on their own because of what they think what's

515
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:09,280
because of what they what's in their mind and there's obviously a tension between these two ideas

516
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:16,160
and recognizing this tension a child might decide the mind what makes a person behave

517
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,920
is not bad embedded it's not part of the body because you don't it doesn't obey the laws of

518
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:30,720
physics that other objects do and that's how you become a dualist in recent work in my lab we tested

519
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:41,120
this theory and what we found is that the the logic was very simple we reasoned that if dualism

520
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:48,560
really has its root if in these core knowledge systems that are innate then if you find a group

521
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:56,160
of individuals in which one of the system is impaired then that should have downstream effects

522
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:03,120
on their dualism and far the more on their ability to accept the innateness and that's exactly what

523
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:09,520
we found so in one study we looked at people with autism who are famously

524
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:17,600
ones that have difficulties reasoning about the minds of others so the people system is weaker

525
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:24,560
and indeed we found that they are kind of released from the curse so to speak so they are less dualist

526
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:32,960
than neurotypicals as you would predict and they also are less biased against innateness

527
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:39,920
also as you would predict in another study we looked at males versus females so males also

528
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:45,280
tend to be lower on the people system than females and we found the same they too

529
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:52,720
were less cursed by dualism and less also cursed by this rejection of innate knowledge

530
01:02:53,280 --> 01:03:00,640
so that suggests to us that dualism itself so now I'm talking just about dualism may not be

531
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:07,760
specifically innate there may not be any selective advantage of you being a dualist directly

532
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:17,680
but maybe the roots of dualism the constellation of our core systems is such that they lead you

533
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:25,840
towards dualism and that's how they all this series of unfortunate events arises

534
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:32,240
certainly I don't know if you've written about this or worked on this in some other areas but

535
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:38,880
would you say again a bit of a speculative question that there are certain evolutionary

536
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:46,000
advantages to having these twin principles of being essentialists and dualists as in I don't

537
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:53,200
want to just say that they're arbitrarily kind of in our nature so to speak but rather do you think

538
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:59,360
there are any okay as I said there's a reason evolutionary speaking that we do have this kind

539
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:06,400
of co-knowledge so the core knowledge has advantages for sure so there is definitely

540
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,360
core knowledge to understanding what an object is you want a chick to go after its mother not

541
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:16,800
after you know you want to recognize it as an entity her body as an entity and having

542
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:23,520
understanding of the minds of others is definitely advantage so you don't need to assume that dualism

543
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:29,520
has an advantage it's not to assume that it's engines the two engines that make you a dualist

544
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:35,600
are innate you don't need to assume that dualism is okay you get it for free so to speak

545
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:44,240
in recent work I'm actually exploring the possibility that dualism might do some good

546
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:49,920
but until I know about it I don't want to talk about it so talk to me in a year or so and I would

547
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:56,080
love to I would love to follow up on that and on the note again of dualism and essentialism

548
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:02,400
one of again one of my favorite favorite chapters from the book which is your chapter on neuroscience

549
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,600
what is irrational love affair with neuroscience it's and I think this is in chapter 11 where you

550
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:16,000
say insane about the brain and interestingly just a bit of a funny anecdote in the podcasting world

551
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:22,080
currently the the the most listened to podcast is in fact a podcast by a neuroscientist

552
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,960
so Andrew Huberman so it's people you are absolutely right that people have this

553
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:32,720
as you said irrational love affair with neuroscience so yeah from this lens a lens of

554
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:39,840
essentialism and dualism can I kind of explain as to why lay people are insane about the brain

555
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:47,600
yeah so I think one clue comes from the fact that I don't think that people care so much about the

556
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:55,360
details about how the brain does it specifically as much as the fact that it does it so I think what

557
01:05:55,360 --> 01:06:03,120
kind of every time people are kind of marveling at is the fact that the life of the mind has a basis

558
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:12,560
in the brain which should have been obvious right what what else do you expect right science tells us

559
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:19,200
that thinking is a physical affair that affects you know physical processes in the brain so of

560
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,920
course think you know that then of course thinking is going to show up in the brain so

561
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,600
what the technical literature in neuroscience is to show exactly what happens and how the brain

562
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:35,920
gives us to thinking which for the most part we don't understand so we don't understand say

563
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:41,440
anything about the computational theory of or for the most we understand very little about the

564
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:47,840
computational theory of mind and how it's actually implemented in the brain but for people that's not

565
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:53,600
what they care about so when they hear this it's really like oh it's actually in the brain that

566
01:06:53,600 --> 01:07:00,640
it's that that's the news for them which is very strange indeed um if you're a dualist then that

567
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:08,960
would be big news for you because you know that that in fact if you're a dualist you have troubles

568
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:17,840
understanding how is it that um the mind can actually affect behavior so if you think about

569
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:26,400
you know I want this battle and this wish that this this your people theory tells you it's in

570
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:32,960
your mind causes my very material hand to grab the battle and how is it possible how can mind

571
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:39,200
command matter this is something that was a problem for the carts and we we did the cart and we did

572
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:44,400
some research that suggests that it's even a problem for lay people when lay people think

573
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,400
about such interactions it's very they have kind of a dissonance this notion that the mind can

574
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:57,040
command the body when you look at that carefully and neuroscience solves this problem because it's

575
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:02,720
telling you listen it's not the mind that's doing the you know the lifting it's the brain that

576
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:10,720
commands the hand so body interacts with body and um you know basically the problem is solved

577
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:19,120
um far the more if you're an essentialist and you believe that what's innate is in the body

578
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:23,760
and how you see it's the body that causes that's the cause of my behavior and then you're beginning

579
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:29,120
to think well maybe this is something that's kind of telling us something that's very deep in me it's

580
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:34,480
something about my essence it's something that I'm born with so if I have depression and you

581
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:40,720
detect it in my brain so all of a sudden oh there must be something that runs in the family and you

582
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,360
better not marry this person and and you know and and you would discriminate against them

583
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:50,000
and it's all baloney because you know the fact that something manifests in the brain tells you

584
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,960
nothing about whether it's innate or not and yet what we have found is that when you give people

585
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:01,200
this information they jump to the horrible conclusion that this trait depression for

586
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:07,920
instance is more likely to be innate um and and that and and they show more stigma so that's

587
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:19,040
very serious problem so dualism makes you super curious about uh the brain because it solves

588
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:25,840
the mind body dissonance um if you're an essentialist you look at the brain as providing

589
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:31,520
further evidence about what's innate and therefore speaking up to to your deep deep essence

590
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:39,840
what makes you who you are and and both of them are based on on misconceptions yeah interestingly

591
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:46,880
I wrote a funny uh rather funny essay uh even Descartes was trying to he was he was wrestling

592
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,280
with this problem and then he theorized that in our brain we have this thing called the pineal

593
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:57,680
gland or something and that's what gives our abstract mind to manifest in the material world and

594
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,600
and so not only a great philosopher like Descartes but as you said even lay people struggle with

595
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:10,400
this question uh just just I'm a bit cognizant of the time professor but a quick tangential point

596
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:16,800
tangential question in fact it's on the idea of emotions uh and and in in one part of the book

597
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:26,320
you say that this idea that innate computational mechanisms are alchemy um and I believe in fact

598
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:32,320
let me just read out the excerpt that's okay on page 168 you say that it is bad enough to assert

599
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:38,480
that emotions are computations claiming that these computations are innate goes way too far

600
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:45,280
but this is precisely what evolutionary psychology asserts and in doing so it challenges our co-beliefs

601
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:53,040
to the max not only does it claim that emotions are computations rather than bodily states it further

602
01:10:53,040 --> 01:11:01,440
suggests that the mechanisms that affect this reck reckoning are innately specialized that there is

603
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:08,480
one innate program for shame another innate program for maternal love and so on so I guess my

604
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:15,360
question would be uh what what is the lay person's understanding of of emotions uh and then would be

605
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:26,240
what does at the moment the current science tells us or the truth let's say um so lay people

606
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:33,200
consider emotions very important for who they are they think of them as part of their essence

607
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:38,640
but of course they think that anything that's innate must be in the body so when we ask them

608
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:45,600
you know to predict whether certain emotions are innate what we found is that people think that

609
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:52,640
emotions that they consider to be um embodied that you can see them in the face so they think

610
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:58,080
they manifest in your stomach and so forth those are the emotions that are more likely to be innate

611
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:05,120
and you can find that's exactly what of course essentialism predicts and you can further show

612
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:11,280
this causal link such that if you give people information that a certain emotion is in the

613
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:17,360
body so if you say tell them you made a scan brain scan and you can detect it in the body

614
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:22,000
they jump to the conclusion that this emotion is innate so people think that

615
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:33,680
um again link innateness to to um being in the body um and as we said people don't think that

616
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:45,120
thinking generally what you know cannot possibly be innate um so you because of this you think

617
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:53,680
about emotions as bodily states rather than as um cognitions as way of thinking um

618
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:03,040
there it's interesting though that it's interesting when you look at the history of the field and

619
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,880
you see how these debates are are running that um there's the question of whether emotions are innate

620
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,520
is is very very controversial and most of this literature about whether emotions are innate

621
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:21,600
really looks at the question of whether emotions show up mostly in the face also in the voice but

622
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:28,480
mostly in the face and then there is a huge debate between those that say that universally

623
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:35,120
facial emotions that that facial emotions are universal and in those that are not and um

624
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,240
I'm just sitting I mean that's not my field I'm reading this and I see that the results are very

625
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:45,520
mixed and then there there's evidence to support both sides but you wonder why people

626
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:52,080
are asking this question in the first place so why assume that emotions are just facial expressions

627
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:58,720
to start with from a methodological perspective I could understand why people started looking at

628
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:04,080
that this way because you know that's an easy way to look at you know people in small scale societies

629
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:10,480
and to um look at their emotional uh understanding but it shouldn't it there's no reason to assume

630
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:15,600
that it must be this way there's no in fact you know there might be an evolutionary advantage

631
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,800
for not revealing your emotional expressions and then to be you know to being a poker player

632
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:28,880
so notion that if if it's innate it must show in in the face seems like like why make this

633
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:36,080
assumptions in the first place um I I don't know you know there might be as I pointed out

634
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:44,640
why scientists think the way they do it's hard to tell but um one wonders whether this resistance

635
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:51,600
that there is to this notion that emotions or computations might come from from this same

636
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:57,840
empiricist bias and that's exactly what evolutionary psychologists claim right so if

637
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:04,640
you know um there are there's research that ask why what is the basis of shame and the answer is

638
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:10,640
it's not necessarily that it's a certain facial expression but rather it's a computation that is

639
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:19,280
designed to uh uh protect you from social devaluation so the idea is that uh you want to keep your

640
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:24,480
good standing in society and if there is a danger of it being devaluated because somebody

641
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:31,120
observed you doing something awful that will cost you you don't want that to happen and

642
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:37,920
shame protects you from this uh from uh it's kind of an internal signal to to attend to this problem

643
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:46,080
that makes predictions about what circumstances should elicit shame and when evolutionary

644
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:51,440
scientists uh have looked at this question they found support for this idea across cultures so

645
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,320
for example if you do something something awful happens to you if you do something shameful

646
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:02,320
if other people watch it then uh your shame you predict the same response to be more serious

647
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:12,640
and which is exactly what this theory predicts um so in the segment you've read I tried to answer

648
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:21,040
the question of why people do not uh think about typically about emotions in this way and the answer

649
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:29,360
is that such computations do not intuitively seem like they could possibly be innate um because

650
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:35,120
people don't think that knowledge can be innate so um that that can explain the resistance position

651
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:41,120
this notion excellent um all right professor since we've only got a few moments left I would love to

652
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:46,640
get to the more speculative questions I don't want to miss out on that uh and I was glad to hear

653
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:51,120
that you said before we started recording that you in fact are in the process of publishing a

654
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:57,120
paper on and core layer uh or the question of consciousness it's published it's already published

655
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,400
excellent so it's uh and and it pertains to dualism and essentialism too right though the

656
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:07,760
work you've currently been doing yes to infect both of them yes excellent yeah so uh yeah just in

657
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:13,760
general uh what are your sort of intimations on the idea of core layer and then a bit more specifically

658
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:22,000
how would how does cognition differ from what philosophers call core layer or in fact does it

659
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:32,720
differ at all I'm not in a position really to to answer this question um people have uh a sense

660
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:41,440
of their uh uh conscious experiences um and they have some intuitions about what they are

661
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:54,320
and in the research that and I think that the big debate in the field is um how we do uh

662
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:04,080
uh what is consciousness um and and uh what is the its place in you know in reality in ontology

663
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:14,640
and um the work of the brilliant philosopher David Chalmers uh has long argued that uh

664
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:22,240
consciousness is distinct from the body so um for example you can think about other creatures

665
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:26,560
that will have your body but will not have the same conscious experiences as you have

666
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:36,320
and um debt to him I I'm not doing justice to his argument but basically what the conclusion

667
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:42,240
that he arrives at is the notion that um consciousness is not physical properties it is

668
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:48,480
distinct from the physical and this is not because you think about it this way it is this way for him

669
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:54,560
so he believes that this reflects how things are ontologically that in reality consciousness is

670
01:18:54,560 --> 01:19:02,240
distinct from the physical but of course we just spent like um an hour and a half talking about

671
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:08,560
how we are intuitive dualist so one wonders is that really because consciousness is distinct

672
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:17,120
from the body or because it only seems distinct to the body in our human eyes and in many so

673
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:24,240
Chalmers gives several examples in which those things go together and it's really difficult

674
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:31,360
to tell which one is going on but in one of these examples which indeed concerns uh uh

675
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:40,000
qualia uh the the conscious experiences of say seeing a red rose um these properties dissociate

676
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:47,920
in a way that one can uh I don't know if we have time not to go into all the predictions but basically

677
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:54,800
this is a case where if you take dualism and essentialism together it will make you predict

678
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:00,640
that people should think about what it takes for you so what happens when you see a rose for the

679
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:06,880
first time if it really alters you in a significant way then it must be something that pertains to

680
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:12,240
your essence and where is your essence it's in your body so that would predict that the properties

681
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:18,400
the conscious experiences that are possibly transformative the ones that are really important

682
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:23,520
to you are bound to be those experiences that you can link to the body or else they can't

683
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:30,640
pretend to your essence they can't be transformative um as I read the Chalmers view

684
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:35,280
for him consciousness is distinct from the body so it should all experiences should be

685
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:42,480
separate from the body um and and it should not depend on how how how significant that is

686
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:47,680
is your experience should not depend on how embodied it is because it's not an embodied affair

687
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:53,680
but that's not what we found what we found was that when people are given those vignettes and

688
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:59,920
asked to make predictions about that what they believe is that if you're going to gain a significant

689
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:04,560
experience you're seeing a rose for the so one of these famous examples marrying the black and

690
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,680
white room marises a rose for the first time and we're asking people well is it significant for her

691
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:15,360
and to say sure it is and if you're going to run a brain scan is it going to show up in the brain

692
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:21,920
and tell you yes and which means they think about this conscious experience as part of the physical

693
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:29,840
world and in fact you know you can make various you know twists on that and the bottom line is

694
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:35,120
as you gain a conscious experience if you compare that an experience in which she just sees the

695
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:41,360
rose and she's not conscious of it and wanting which she sees it and it is conscious what's the

696
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:47,280
difference well being conscious is more significant it's also more likely to manifest in the body

697
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:55,280
I see I see so and the more likely it is to manifest in the body the more physical you see the

698
01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:03,120
more the stronger is the experience which is not what you would expect right but if the original

699
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:07,280
explanation child was explanation of the black and white marrying the black and white room is

700
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:14,720
what she what you think the conscious experience is distinct from the body and somehow you're

701
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:19,600
privy to this factor else why we care about your intuitions about this case in the first place

702
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:27,680
so consciousness is different from the body and your and your privy to that and yes people

703
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:34,800
have intuitions about that but in their view you know consciousness is actually an embodied experience

704
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:42,320
so and furthermore in other research in another experiment of this series we found that the more

705
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:49,040
dualist they are the more likely the stronger their intuitions about Mary so there is very strong

706
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:56,960
evidence that suggests that the source of this of the of of what you gain in consciousness people

707
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:03,360
think about that conscious experience as something that is very physical very in very much in the

708
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:11,600
body in this paper explain exactly how dualism and essentialism conspired to give you this intuition

709
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:17,200
so how you can be both dualist but also essentialism can make you think about that transformative

710
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:22,400
experience of being in the body but I think it presents some challenge to this notion that

711
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:28,640
so you can explain everything that's going on in our into either you assume that the initial

712
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:33,600
assumption that we can have intuitions about consciousness is false this is one possibility

713
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:41,520
or if you do assume that we have intuitions about consciousness then what this suggests is the sort

714
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:48,800
that well at the very least what this suggested that the the reason why we see consciousness

715
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:56,080
the way we view we do comes from our internal biases there is no need to assume anything about

716
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:04,400
ontology here so of course I can't tell anything about what ontology is but the psychology of that

717
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:09,760
gives a very compelling story yeah but interestingly it's only a philosopher that would kind of

718
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:16,160
ontologize and try to maybe argue like a charm is this that consciousness is something separate from

719
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:24,560
the body yeah but it has been a very influential argument and one that neuroscientists have been

720
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:32,880
quite engaged with yeah uh what okay professor is it okay if you go about five minutes over time

721
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:38,320
or do you I just want to ask you I'm quite curious about this question given you're a cognitive

722
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:44,720
psychologist uh so psychoanalysis I've been fascinated by for a for a long time in fact but

723
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:51,760
more from a philosophical angle and in fact I got into it through philosophy and this the late

724
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:57,440
mario Rudy who was working in an English department in fact so it certainly isn't a science but just

725
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:03,520
as a cognitive scientist what are your intimations and views on the field of psychoanalysis

726
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:15,840
um I'm I'm not as educated as I would want to be um there are definitely some very

727
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:24,400
concrete empirical criticism of Freud that I think are very well placed um about the

728
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:31,920
falsifiability of his proposal and uh it's empirical adequacy and all that all this criticism

729
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:41,040
is very well placed but I think it was a genius I think he gave cognitive science two of its most

730
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:48,640
precious ideas um the first is the idea of the subconscious I mean I don't know the history

731
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:53,760
of ideas sufficiently to know whether we should really credit him for that but suddenly he got it

732
01:25:53,760 --> 01:26:00,320
right this is certainly the core of everything everything that's interesting about cognition

733
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:06,960
generally in language specifically happens totally under the hood it's not something that

734
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:16,560
people capture and he had the stature to have this insight and I think this is very significant

735
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:23,120
and we owe him a debt of gratitude the other the debt of gratitude that I think is important and

736
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:29,760
people sometimes look at that this kind of um kind of the they take it against him and I don't

737
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:39,200
was this notion that thinking about the psyche in physicalist terms so he had this thermodynamic

738
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:46,800
notion of the psyche um and people say oh yeah you always apply the latest in science to study the

739
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:53,920
psyche but it is not trivial to think about the psyche as a physical system because we are dualist

740
01:26:54,480 --> 01:27:01,600
so this is the farthest from us to think that one can explain psychological processes in physical

741
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:07,920
terms but this is exactly the basis of the computational theory of mind the notion that

742
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:16,160
the reason the thinking is a mechanical process that manipulates this form of representations

743
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,760
and this notion that you can think about the psyche as a physical system is brilliant

744
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:29,840
not something that's available to us intuitively at all so I think Freud had two very big ideas that

745
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:37,280
I again it's I leave it to somebody else to make the analysis of where these ideas came from and

746
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:45,280
how they stayed with us but for nothing else I think that these are really one of the most

747
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:50,560
important ideas that stay with us these days and the two should be very grateful for them

748
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:58,160
certainly I mean in line with this book you'd say that at least Freud could go against his human

749
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:04,640
nature and overcome the blindness to study the psyche as a physical assistant excellent

750
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:08,640
thank you for that professor Berwin I know that these are highly speculative questions but they

751
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:16,560
always do fascinate me uh well I'd love to ask what so sorry just one other thing the paper

752
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:20,880
that you mentioned when we were talking about uh qualia and consciousness what exactly was the

753
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:29,680
name of the paper it appeared uh in the journal open mind and the name of the paper I'm the author

754
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:35,920
on that and I should have should have known what is it called if I if I emailed you afterwards

755
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:42,240
and I can put it in the description down below for people to read I can tell you in a second

756
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:48,320
I felt look at my references and this one is called the heart problem of consciousness arises

757
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:54,480
from human psychology excellent I shall find it and put it in the description and it's an open

758
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:59,920
access so you can read it that is that is lovely yeah so uh professor what other projects are you

759
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:05,280
working on what other are there any books in the pipeline I'd love to hear give us a bit of a teaser

760
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:13,440
on what's next uh there's a project on dualism that's coming and and some of uh you know some of

761
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:21,200
the the obvious um problems of dualism but possibly also some of the um silver lining of

762
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:26,720
being a dualist and how you live a dualist life so yes how to live a dualist life but it's probably

763
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:32,800
going to be a self-help book by no I'm joking that's not the intention but yeah absolutely I'm

764
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:37,280
joking of course but nah thank you so much I'm grateful for your time professor this this means

765
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:43,120
a lot to me especially given hopefully next year I'll be doing my master's program and then I'm

766
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:49,360
certainly uh more excited than I could put it in words so thank you thank you so much

767
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:54,640
pleasure talking to you good luck on your master's I look forward to seeing what you do
