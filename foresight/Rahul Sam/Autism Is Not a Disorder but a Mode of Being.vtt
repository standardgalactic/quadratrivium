WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.880
All right, this is an excellent segue, Leon.

00:01.880 --> 00:04.840
But the problem is, unfortunately, we're short for time.

00:04.840 --> 00:07.160
So forgive me for rushing you with this.

00:07.160 --> 00:12.320
But I think in the forward and in the introduction itself,

00:12.320 --> 00:16.360
you basically claim, of course, as you highlighted,

00:16.360 --> 00:20.880
the subjective structures that Freud and Lacan

00:20.880 --> 00:24.920
identified with neurosis, perversion, and psychosis.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.360
And then in the book, you posit that autism,

00:29.400 --> 00:34.240
you say is not a pathology, but a mode of being.

00:34.240 --> 00:37.440
So again, I know we're short of short for time,

00:37.440 --> 00:42.640
but if you could sort of maybe give us a prelude,

00:42.640 --> 00:44.840
because obviously to get an understanding of that,

00:44.840 --> 00:49.840
you got to read the book, but a very elementary prelude

00:49.840 --> 00:53.680
as to what you mean by firstly, a mode of being,

00:53.680 --> 00:59.160
and then why you claim that autism is another mode of being

00:59.160 --> 01:01.880
on top of the ones identified by Freud and Lacan.

01:05.160 --> 01:10.680
So first, let me say, Rahul, that I don't know.

01:10.680 --> 01:14.040
You can see if your listeners are interested in our talk

01:14.040 --> 01:18.080
or you yourself, and we can schedule another meeting

01:18.080 --> 01:19.440
if you want to continue.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.480
I'd be very grateful.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.480
Yes.

01:21.480 --> 01:25.080
I want to ask you about foreclosure.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.000
And particularly, may you highlight

01:27.000 --> 01:29.840
the difference between a psychotic flakosha

01:29.840 --> 01:31.120
and autistic flakosha?

01:31.120 --> 01:33.200
And I don't think we'll have time today for that.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.400
So maybe this could be just an introduction.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.640
And I'd be very grateful if we could reschedule another talk,

01:38.640 --> 01:40.800
another conversation.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.520
Sure, sure.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.280
So that's, I put this on the table,

01:44.280 --> 01:48.360
so we won't be too stressed for a time, OK?

01:48.360 --> 01:50.560
Thank you.

01:50.600 --> 01:57.440
So yeah, I give this idea of a mode of being,

01:57.440 --> 02:01.240
borrowing this from the phenomenologists, of course,

02:01.240 --> 02:02.880
this kind of term.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.360
But I use it a bit differently in the book.

02:05.360 --> 02:13.120
And this is the idea that one's particular use of language

02:13.120 --> 02:17.840
in order to compensate for the inherent schism

02:17.880 --> 02:23.800
between the inner world and the humanized world

02:23.800 --> 02:25.720
is, for me, a mode of being.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.760
It is a mode of existence.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.360
Because we find our existence in language,

02:30.360 --> 02:33.920
as you were saying and you were quoting from the book.

02:33.920 --> 02:38.040
One is does not only find their meaning,

02:38.040 --> 02:43.840
let's say, in this kind of Satrian way,

02:43.840 --> 02:48.320
existence prior to meaning that you are born

02:48.320 --> 02:55.160
and then you find who you are or whatever your goals or aims

02:55.160 --> 02:57.160
are at your life.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.400
We see with you is this expert that you brought,

03:00.400 --> 03:04.560
is that one is born already endowed with meaning,

03:04.560 --> 03:08.000
already determined by language.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.440
And we say it's a name.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.520
It's these projections that the parents might have on a baby,

03:13.520 --> 03:15.840
even before it is born.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.800
Today, we have the sonogram and these images of the baby

03:20.800 --> 03:21.760
and the womb.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.120
People already start having their fantasies

03:24.120 --> 03:27.880
about even their face structure.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.400
We know if they're a boy or a girl,

03:30.400 --> 03:34.880
one has already meanings that are stuck to them

03:34.880 --> 03:35.760
before they're born.

03:36.600 --> 03:45.840
And so we say one becomes human, one subjectifies,

03:45.840 --> 03:51.360
one is situated in the humanized world

03:51.360 --> 03:54.640
through their use of language, through their relationship

03:54.640 --> 03:57.920
with this language that is alien, that is outside of them,

03:57.920 --> 04:02.480
that exists prior and will exist after.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.320
Now, this particular use of language

04:04.320 --> 04:07.280
is a mode of existence because it situates us

04:07.280 --> 04:11.600
in the world, in the social world, in our body,

04:11.600 --> 04:15.080
in relationship with other people in the world,

04:15.080 --> 04:18.040
in relationship with our own ego.

04:18.040 --> 04:25.120
So language is the mode through which one becomes.

04:25.120 --> 04:30.000
And then neurosis is one of these modes.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.560
And I argue that psychosis and perversion

04:33.560 --> 04:36.080
are also these modes.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.560
But my point is, and this is where

04:39.560 --> 04:43.240
I think maybe this mode of being steps away

04:43.240 --> 04:47.920
from the Heideggerian design, this mode of being

04:47.920 --> 04:54.000
that Heidegger speaks about, is that I'll be a little blunt.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.960
For me, everyone is developmentally disordered.

05:00.960 --> 05:04.000
They say that autism is a developmental disorder.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.920
This is how it's determined.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.360
If you follow Freud, everyone is necessarily

05:10.360 --> 05:12.960
developmentally disordered.

05:12.960 --> 05:16.240
Freud speaks about the fixation of the drives.

05:16.240 --> 05:20.000
So the drives are these things that determine our pleasure

05:20.000 --> 05:20.760
and suffering.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.120
And he says that at a certain point in one's life,

05:23.120 --> 05:26.200
they're fixated, and they stop developing,

05:26.200 --> 05:27.880
uses these words.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.120
They are stopped in the middle of their development.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.160
And then they continue in the same way,

05:33.160 --> 05:34.560
which is not the proper way.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.600
It is just a way that keeps on functioning.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.320
So everyone is, in a sense, developmentally disordered.

05:41.320 --> 05:46.120
We are born split with this inherent schism that

05:46.120 --> 05:47.960
is unmendable.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.680
We use language to compensate for it.

05:50.680 --> 05:56.880
And as we do something in the development of the drives,

05:56.880 --> 06:00.680
of these things that move us, that color the world,

06:00.680 --> 06:04.840
that make the world, basically, objects

06:04.840 --> 06:08.680
exist in the world when they are invested with libido.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.880
They don't exist when they are not invested.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.960
So basically, this means that the world stops developing,

06:14.960 --> 06:16.560
in this sense.

06:16.560 --> 06:20.080
So everyone, the neurotic, the psychotic, the perverse,

06:20.120 --> 06:23.600
and the autistic are all developmentally disordered.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.320
And this is why each of these perspectives

06:26.320 --> 06:28.440
are, let's say, a mode of being.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.360
They're an attitude in relation to reality.

06:31.360 --> 06:36.080
They're a way to do with language.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.880
When I say then that they are distinct,

06:38.880 --> 06:44.280
then I don't make here some kind of an ontological argument.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.720
And this is something that's important to clarify.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.800
I don't mean that here's Woody Allen.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.560
He's neurotic.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.680
Here's Daniel Schreber for its case.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.200
He's psychotic.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.040
And here's, I don't know, Temple Grandin.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.360
She's autistic.

07:02.360 --> 07:09.400
I mean that there are different ways to do with language.

07:09.400 --> 07:20.280
And these necessitate our attention as analysts.

07:20.280 --> 07:24.520
And it means that working with this particular subject that

07:24.520 --> 07:27.800
has this particular way of doing with language

07:27.800 --> 07:31.400
will dictate situating myself in the transference

07:31.400 --> 07:35.200
in such and such a way, and making such and such

07:35.200 --> 07:36.440
interventions.

07:36.440 --> 07:40.600
And with the psychotic subject, that will not be the case.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.160
Because if I will position myself in the same way,

07:44.160 --> 07:46.160
that could be catastrophic.

07:46.160 --> 07:50.040
For instance, this is something, again,

07:50.040 --> 07:52.640
it's not a real example, it's just to clarify my point.

07:52.640 --> 07:57.400
So with neurotic, it's important not to answer one's

07:57.400 --> 07:59.440
demands for love many times.

07:59.440 --> 08:04.040
And this also means that you sometimes go on vacation

08:04.040 --> 08:07.920
and you don't really say, look, I'm sorry,

08:07.920 --> 08:11.160
but I have to go and continue.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.200
You say, I'm going.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.280
We see each other in two weeks.

08:14.280 --> 08:15.480
Let's set a date.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.360
Good.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.480
With the psychotic subject, you will not do that.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.640
Because there is a risk for, let's say,

08:23.640 --> 08:26.720
a paranoid thoughts.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.160
Where is he going?

08:28.160 --> 08:29.360
Is he staying home?

08:29.360 --> 08:30.280
Will he be here?

08:30.280 --> 08:31.760
Is he seeing other people?

08:31.800 --> 08:35.280
Is he actually going to follow me and not tell me?

08:35.280 --> 08:37.640
So with the psychotic, I would say, I'm going for two weeks.

08:37.640 --> 08:38.400
I will be here.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.200
This is my email.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.400
You can contact me.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.400
I'll be available between these and these hours.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.120
I'll come back on Tuesday and we meet immediately on Wednesday.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.720
And you can write to me if there's a problem

08:47.720 --> 08:50.920
and we can reschedule, et cetera.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.600
So you see that there's a different way

08:53.600 --> 08:56.840
one engages with even the logistical level

08:56.840 --> 08:59.440
of handling an analysis.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.320
So this manifests itself on all the other levels.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.400
So what I'm saying, when I'm saying that autism

09:05.400 --> 09:08.840
is a distinct mode of being, is I'm

09:08.840 --> 09:13.800
saying that one needs to handle an analysis under the hypothesis

09:13.800 --> 09:17.160
of autism in a way that is different than the one

09:17.160 --> 09:24.000
that we would do when there is a hypothesis of psychosis,

09:24.000 --> 09:25.760
perversion, and neurosis.
