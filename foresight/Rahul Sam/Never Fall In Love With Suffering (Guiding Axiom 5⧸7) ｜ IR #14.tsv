0	4440	Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the interval and podcast and
4440	10200	today I'm gonna read out guiding axiom number five which is a part of this sub
10200	14160	series that I've been doing where I've been reading out these axioms that I
14160	18960	wrote for my newsletter the unhappy man links down below in the description and
18960	24000	as I was writing down these axioms I realized I'm in fact setting up a
24000	31760	framework for sounds like someone just got shot outside that's fine we don't
31760	36520	live in America this is really a people don't get shot here
36520	41960	came back to it when I was laying down these axioms I realized that oh yeah
41960	46000	this is a framework for all of my creative work if it only makes sense to
46000	50640	read them out in this podcast given that this podcast is a part of my creative
50640	55760	work I'm sorry if that sounds pretentious and also it allows me to have a
55760	60360	bit of structured thinking and writing I think is the best way to do that today's
60360	66880	axiom axiom number five is undoubtedly my favorite one it's never fallen love
66880	70920	with your suffering or well I said never fall in love with suffering as a
70920	75360	category and the reason it's important for me is because from all the axioms
75360	82200	I've laid down in many ways these axioms are an antidote to my flaws or things
82200	86480	that I see are shortcomings in my character be it morally spiritually
86480	91160	existentially whatever you want to call it and that's why I'm writing down
91160	96320	these axioms so that I don't let these shortcomings in my character of who am
96320	102720	as a person impact the work I do and falling in love with suffering my god
102720	108840	I am I'm kind of ashamed how how vain it is when I really understood this
108840	114840	concept thanks a lot to Slavoj Zizek I think it's reading his stuff and
114840	118360	listening to his lectures that really influenced me as to why it's a bad idea
118360	124280	to fall in love with suffering and most of us subconsciously or unconsciously do
124280	129440	this therefore it's it's important to be cognizant of this phenomena without
129440	134240	further ado enough of a prelude let's get to the axiom so yes as I said it's
134240	141080	the unhappy man guiding axiom number five never fall in love with suffering and
141080	146600	of course I've got this painting by Goya this is an interesting one of cryos
146600	153200	crucified this is before I think he went through his face of depression but of
153200	158480	course suffering is very much connected to the archetypal story of the western
158840	164080	collective unconscious let's say of the crucifixion that's why I decided to
164080	169160	pick this any kirkard guardian is familiar with the captivating admission
169160	175200	in either or my melancholy is the most faithful mistress I have known what
175200	180680	wonder then that I love her in return most of us of the existentialist elk
180680	185680	have fully bought into the dogma of the depressed yet perspicacious philosopher
186400	192040	for us all great truths lack profundity if not written in a shopenhari and
192040	198280	pessimism about our condition the misery of existence is what those with great
198280	204320	intelligence and deep hearts have come to see to not see this verity is nothing
204320	210400	but naivety at least this is the bullshit we tell ourselves to be depressed or
210400	216400	suffer needlessly as far from the romantic beauty we give to it none of it
216400	221600	makes one so deeper and inspires philosophically penetrating poetry or
221600	228360	the staff skin literature in fact when I read my nonsensical journaling written
228360	234920	during the low points I see it as nothing but vain egotistical pabula which
234920	239880	is why I stopped journaling it's a waste of time and better drinking away your
239880	248200	sorrows this is a joke for them but beyond a stentatious vanity we all dwell
248200	252960	with our misery purely to feel something we often deliberately seek
252960	258360	pathological relationships only because the melodramatic pain of love reminds
258360	263600	us of our humanness better to feel pain than nothing at all
263600	272080	OS Dostoevsky wrote if he human beings does not find means he will contrive
272080	277320	destruction and chaos will contrive suffering of all sorts only to gain
277320	284200	his point notes from underground and of course being willing to suffer through
284200	289760	love particularly romantic tells us of our goodness of our higher virtues in
289760	295520	being authentically self-sacrificial for another such as why Nietzsche wrote
295520	302320	ultimately it is a desire not the desire that we love your granival I must
302320	309600	admit that I am ashamed of how pathetic we are as a species having said that I
309600	314000	see why modern people lust after suffering as they are given the
314000	318960	impossible choice of contrived pseudo happiness in the form of new age self
319000	324680	help which you all know is rife with empty patitudes I bullshit and the
324680	330040	finger wagging pull yourself up by your bootstraps heartless American stoicism
330040	336720	it seems that we're stuck in this binary the modern age is an era of nihilism so
336720	341280	as Nietzsche the man who explored the symptom to his ultimate road read from
341280	345800	a distant planet the majestical script of our earthly existence would perhaps
345960	351000	seduce the reader to the conclusion that the earth was the aesthetic planet
351000	357080	parks alone an outposts of discontented arrogant and nasty creatures who
357080	363400	harbored a deep disgust for themselves for the world for all life and hurt
363400	368400	themselves as much as possible out of pleasure in hurting probably their only
368400	373320	pleasure the passage above is from a skating critique of the aesthetic ideal
373960	378760	the mode of life he pillories has little to do with religious asceticism but
378760	385080	say but rather a cultural zeitgeist despite the characteristic phenomenon
385080	390360	being cross cultural for instance he would be as equally contemptuous of the
390360	396600	contemporary postmodern stoicism of the ryan holy types or neoliberal western
396600	401240	buddhism that turns a blind eye to the problems of the world and decides to
401240	406440	inflict suffering on oneself for the pleasure of it ie cold showers fasting
406440	411880	crossfit etc irrespective of religious connotations all such modes of being
411880	418280	manifest a drive towards the ascetic ideal so his sentiments are apt to any
418280	425160	pseudo suffering we create purely to inject artificial meaning into our barren
425160	429640	desolate veins whether in the form of modern self-help cults with their
429720	435320	unending self-flagellation or a morbid romantic relationship that's conspicuously
435320	441560	making everyone suffer we desire meaning perhaps the intrinsic human reality is
441560	446920	meaninglessness and the incompleteness of life therefore we ought to be cognizant
446920	452200	of how we respond to our predicament and one can only live authentically once
452200	457880	his datum is confronted in my view the only true antidote to meaninglessness
457880	462040	or nihilism of our culture is love but that's a whole other essay or book
463880	468840	listen on suffering on suffering as a psychological phenomenon i find affinity
468840	475160	with the zhezhekyan sentiments on the matter footnote influenced by zhak lakon's concept of
475160	480840	joystones and the Freudian death drive zhezhek made the following point in in his books and
480840	487400	lectures paraphrasing don't fall in love with your suffering never presume that your suffering is
487400	494120	in itself proof of your authenticity renunciation of pleasure can easily turn into pleasure of
494120	500600	renunciation itself back to the essay pleasure never satiates us as there's only so much of it
500600	506760	one can enjoy therefore we seek the pleasure beyond pleasure and willfully suffer for an
506760	514440	ostensibly noble course but in reality this is our yearning to fill the void in life we hope to
514440	520520	overcome the abyss with a deeper spiritual meaning sometimes with a touch of romanticism as we see
520520	528600	in fascism that's elusive for us in the technological age footnote read the question concerning
528600	534920	technology essay by martin heidegger to understand what this age entails when i mean this age i mean
534920	540040	the current age we live in or the technological age to be more specific i'll read that again that's
540040	546120	elusive for us in the technological age where to test have skis this may man has become nothing
546120	554120	but a piano key martyrdom for instance typifies his drive within us despite the words of tomology
554120	560920	a martyr is not a purely religious individual or some fundamentalist fanatic to a certain extent
560920	567400	everyone sees themselves as a martyr from a self-sacrificial parent and a serious employee
567480	573560	working 15 hours a day at a trendy postmodern startup to a nurse working in palliative care
575000	581480	to the martin us the pain of sacrifice and duty gives us that pleasure when the so-called
581480	587880	worldly pleasures generally a derided term but it shouldn't be are inadequate footnote
587880	593000	pleasure which could be misunderstood by how it's colloquially used in the carnal hedonic sense
593480	599080	may not be the aptus term for this instance but i've decided to stick with it since i'm speaking
599080	604920	in Freudian nomenclature i'll reread that sentence because i feel jumping to the footnotes tend to
604920	608760	break the flow of things but i kind of have to read out the footnotes because they are related
608760	614120	to what i'm writing to the martyr in us the pain of sacrifice and duty gives us that pleasure
614120	620120	when the so-called worldly pleasures generally a derided term but it shouldn't be are inadequate
621080	627560	or as G. K. Chesterton wrote pessimism is not in being tired of evil but in being tired of good
628200	634920	despair does not lie in being wary of suffering but in being wary of joy the everlasting man
634920	639400	of course none of this implies we shouldn't take upon actual responsibility in life and
639400	645560	carry the world's burdens nor does it mean above all that love is free of a sword and fire
646360	652760	Alan Burjou observed this is in his book in praise of love by the way it's a great little book
652760	657960	that i've been recommending to many people it's a lovely read reading that again Alan Burjou
657960	663560	observed that our culture is atypically in trying to sell a safety first concept of love
664440	671320	it is love comprehensively ensured against all risks you will have love but will have assessed
671320	677480	the prospective relationship so thoroughly will have selected your partner so carefully by
677480	683880	switching online by obtaining of course a photo details of his or her tastes date of birth
683880	691640	horoscope signs etc and putting it all in the mix you can tell yourself this is a risk-free option
692520	700200	but he fights back against such safetyism i'm convinced that love cannot be a gift given on
700200	707480	the basis of a complete lack of risk the mythic french online dating service approach reminds
707480	713240	me of the propaganda of the american army when promoting the idea of smart bombs and zero dead
713240	720360	wars in praise of love so we ought to pick up battles and be cognizant of the difference
720360	727480	between sacrifice for higher life-sustaining ideals of love justice etc that bring forth
727560	733960	genuine good and on the other hand suffering for the love of suffering itself the latter is
733960	741880	nothing but vanity and exhibitionism any blind renunciation of pleasure and seeking of suffering
741880	748200	becomes a kind of Machiavellian narcissism worse than what you'd see from a typical more explicit
748200	753560	trump-like narcissists as the former is the ultimate wolf in sheep's clothing
754360	761800	ergo as jujek candidly tells us never fall in love with your suffering suffering as a category
762680	769240	but i'd go a step further and assert never fall in love with suffering as a category period firstly
769240	775080	because it's simply un-pragmatic suffering doesn't make anyone's life better and has no
775080	782120	ennobling qualities in itself secondly and more importantly the fixation of suffering has imbued
782120	789160	unspeakable amounts of evil kiss in point i'm disgusted by how post-modern neoliberals that's
789160	796120	most of us fetishize poverty we implicitly believe there's some deepfound wisdom in the suffering
796120	802520	of the poor that those exploited in the mica mines in india for extortionate makeup products
802520	807640	have a profundity to their souls that we degenerate westerners have lost or we would
807720	813480	salivatingly cite an outdated statistic about bangladeshi people being happier
813480	820120	than rich americans footnote who says happiness is the purpose of life or that it's even something
820120	825880	worth measuring it doesn't matter that they're happier if the rapacious fashion industry aloves
825880	832760	for tragedies like the rana plaza collapse in such moments happiness is an unethical category
832760	839400	it's out of the question but isn't all of this romanticization of poverty at a nonsense isn't it
839400	846040	yet another example of the aforementioned suffering fetish this time despicably manifested in the
846040	852520	political domain i doubt any of us unpretentiously listen to a poor person except to an ideological
852520	859320	lens which tells us what to hear over what the person's truly saying personally whenever i've
859320	866440	spoken to someone struggling to survive and barely making ends meet i see nothing but despondency
866440	872680	pain and resentment not the pristine goodness in the souls of poor folk would prescribe on them
873800	879320	not the wisdom of the heart we'd read about in a charles dickens novel of course dickens knew
879320	886920	this better than all of us i partially blame the misappropriation of the crucifixion for the
886920	894920	fetishism of suffering i'm not surprised as someone deeply enamored by christ the crucifixion
894920	901000	is an infinite superhistorical event happening in the eternal now footnote
902920	909080	i borrow this term from poldtelics book eternal now which encapsulate most of his superlative
909080	916280	theology i highly recommend that book he probably gives the best description of god that i've
916280	923240	ever read in my life and i think he's right he's correct to describe god as the ground of all being
924520	931160	actually i say meditating on it has changed my life or more accurately given me a new one
931800	937560	and i shall expand on the matter in later essays in any case crucified christ is only
937560	943720	part of the christian narrative and we replace the whole with a fragment at great peril we ought to
943720	951160	never forget christ also resurrected as bizarre as that sounds notwithstanding one's religious
951160	958120	beliefs be it atheist or spiritual but not religious all of us think of ourselves as a
958120	965560	suffering christ carrying a cross footnote to understand why i recommend starting with
965560	972600	tom holland's dominion and slavojic's fragile absolutes because as don cupid wrote nobody in
972600	978680	the west can be holy non christian you make hold yourself non christian but the dreams you dream
978680	986120	are still christian dreams since we even migrants to the west like myself dream in christianity
986120	991880	we ought to never rush into glamorizing the suffering christ and instead be searingly
991880	997960	skeptical of our underlying humanistic intentions behind the vinnia of self-sacrificial love
997960	1006440	perhaps christ was thinking my dad's a malevolent sedomasticistic son of a bitch who's thrown me
1006440	1013320	into gratuitous suffering because of a twisted cosmic jurisprudential atonement he's conjured
1013320	1021800	up ex nihilo at least this is what theologians like william lane craig tell us if christ was the
1021800	1028360	gold man then for him to say ally ally lamar sabustani my god my god why have you forsaken me
1029240	1036040	is an unsurprising remark for one to make while being crucified and here as jujek points out
1036600	1042840	momentarily god himself becomes an atheist it's the negation and even hatred of god
1042840	1049560	e.g. book of job that makes christianity unique from any other religion and makes our culture
1049640	1056600	outlandish footnote martin scorsese's silence explores this phenomenon well with the modern
1056600	1064360	flavor of man's helpless frustration at god and gk chesterton's orthodoxy encapsulates his idea
1064360	1070760	best from any modern theology i've ever read we see in christianity the utmost palpable story
1070760	1077720	of existence human suffering can be so unbearable that even god once he comes down to us realizes
1077720	1085160	he can't bear it and loses faith ergo the separation from god is a part of divinity itself
1085160	1091080	and it's only the christian god that knows the alienation of being human i go on these detours
1091080	1097400	only to explicate my view that suffering in itself has no higher soul maturing virtue
1098600	1106120	we don't have to artificially create and fetishize it as pain tragedy and our happiness are already
1106120	1113480	concomitant with the vicissitudes of life so despite this newsletter being called the unhappy
1113480	1120520	man i shall never fall in love with unhappiness and suffering if i ever do i will stop writing
1121720	1127720	thanks for watching as i said the link to this uh essay is down below in the description if you
1127720	1133320	do prefer reading it please do check it out but i shall see you in the next one cheers
