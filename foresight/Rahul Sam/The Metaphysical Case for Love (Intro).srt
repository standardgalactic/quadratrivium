00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey everyone, welcome to the reading of my essay, The Metaphysical Case for Love. Now in this video

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,520
I'll only be reading the introduction because the whole essay is 15,000 words long, therefore

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,200
I'll probably read it in parts and upload it as a video series, but today we're gonna start off

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:24,160
with the introduction. Here goes, The Metaphysical Case for Love. Love has to be rescued from the

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,960
love industrial complex. The following is the third of my tripartite essay series on love,

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,360
why it matters and the dire need for love's reinvention. I'll leave the links for part

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,880
one and two in the description down below, and this is the most philosophically dense piece

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:48,240
in the series, so risk yourself. Our culture endlessly speaks of dating, yet rarely of love.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,560
Partly the reason is the death of sincerity and our overall apathy towards life,

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,880
expected in a culture void of metaphysical foundations. Most of us live innocuously,

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,840
as the saying goes, we approach life by not touching it with a 10-foot pole.

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,360
As is the time of nomadism, where cosmic couchsurfers seldom do we commit to anything or anyone,

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,360
be it a political struggle, one's family, or a passionate romance. We'd prefer,

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,760
quote-unquote, my freedom over being bothered by the messiness of an engaged and old consuming life.

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,720
But, as Marxists understood, the freedom we speak of is a pseudo-freedom to sell our labor,

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,360
succumb to the demands of the market economy and be a consumer. That is, the freedom to be a slave

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,480
to capitalism. Footnote, consumerism acts by creating false needs in us, the subjects.

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,840
They aren't genuine needs that satisfy us but are imposed by our society, or life world.

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,200
When you succumb to ideological demands and strive to fulfill these needs, you realize they are

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,040
unfulfillable. Nonetheless, you will keep desiring more, consequently loosing your freedom.

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,680
For more context, read Chapter 1 of Herbert MacCousa's One-Dimensional Man, and watch this video

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,520
by Julian de Medeiros explaining Gisex's theory of Coca-Cola, which I'll link down below, and

23
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,440
footnote. Love also is difficult to speak of because it only makes sense in retrospect.

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,120
Doesn't Soren Kerkertgaard's best known saying,

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,360
life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards, apply the most to love?

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,920
Footnote, the original quote from Kerkertgaard's journals,

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,760
it is really true what philosophy tells us, that life must be understood backwards.

28
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,200
But with this, one forgets the second proposition, that it must be lived forwards.

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,320
The proposition which, the more it is subjected to careful thought, the more it ends up concluding

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,000
precisely, that life at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood.

31
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,520
Exactly because there is no single moment where time stops, completely,

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,280
in order for me to take position to do this, going backwards.

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,640
End footnote, there perhaps isn't anything more unfathomable than love.

34
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,640
Falling in love is a bizarre experience, because it always hits you by surprise,

35
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,280
thus it's aptly called a fall in English or Thumbehe Meiro in French.

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,280
You may be casually dating someone for a while, and suddenly you realize you're in love,

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,640
and afterwards, you attempt to rationalize and retrospectively give meaning to your fall.

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,720
If the point of love is that, despite it appearing to be predestined, the fall always comes first,

39
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:52,160
it's fully contingent and unplanned. Therefore, within eros, romance has no technical strategy,

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,880
the secret of love is that there is no secret, such as why Slavoj Rizek says the modern dating

41
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,560
approach is flawed. Start quote, the problem with online dating is that it automatically

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,800
involves an aspect of self-commodification or self-manipulation. When you date online,

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,920
you must present yourself in a certain way, putting forward certain qualities. You focus on your idea

44
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,120
of how other people should perceive you, but that's not how love functions, even at a very

45
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,360
simple level. The English term is endearing foibles, an elementary ingredient in love.

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,400
You can't ever fall in love with the perfect person. There must be some tiny small disturbing

47
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,160
element, and it is only through noticing this element that you can say, but in spite of that

48
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,040
perfection, I love him or her. End quote. So, self-help books, dating and relationship coaches

49
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,440
are useless in attempting to make romance a tactical game, epitomized in the self-commodification

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,080
done by users of dating apps. If all of poetry, literature and cinema has shown as one thing

51
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,280
since time immemorial, authentic love has no recipe to be conveniently followed.

52
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,040
Does this mean speaking of love is futile? No, because as Peter Rollins writes with a twist on

53
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,200
the famous Wittgensteinian proposition, footnote. Little bit Wittgenstein wrote,

54
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,640
what we cannot speak about, we must pass over in silence and footnote. But Peter Rollins writes,

55
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,480
that which we cannot speak of is the one thing about whom and to whom we must never stop speaking.

56
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,960
Love, not unlike God, is inexhaustible, therefore it ought to be spoken of for eternity.

57
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,640
Now more than ever, philosophers, poets, artists must tackle the subject of love.

58
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,160
It shouldn't be left to be exploited by capitalism and violated by its actors of the

59
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,920
love industrial complex. Dating coaches and apps, pop psychology and self-help books,

60
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:08,160
relationship podcast, pickup artists, etc. Now more than ever, philosophers, poets, artists

61
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,800
must tackle the subject of love. It shouldn't be left to be exploited by capitalism and violated

62
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,600
by its actors of the love industrial complex, e.g. dating coaches and apps, pop psychology and

63
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,640
self-help books, relationship podcast, pickup artists, etc. Abha Kamu famously wrote,

64
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,400
There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life

65
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,040
is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.

66
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,280
All the rest, whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or

67
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,360
twelve categories, comes afterwards. If I ask myself how to judge that this question is more

68
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:01,360
urgent than that, I reply that one judges by the actions it entails. I have never seen anyone die

69
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,960
for the ontological argument. Galileo, who held a scientific truth of great importance,

70
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,880
exerted with the greatest ease as soon as it endangered his life. In a certain sense,

71
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,280
he did right. That truth was not worth the stake. Whether the earth or the sun revolves around the

72
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,920
other is a matter of profound indifference. To tell the truth, it is a futile question.

73
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,520
On the other hand, I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living.

74
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,400
Coincidentally, since it's been a predominant reason for people committing suicide, love too

75
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,840
ought to be placed in the position of suicide as a philosophical question.

76
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,240
Can we continue? Suicide has never been dealt with except as a social phenomenon.

77
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,240
Similarly, love, in our times, is dealt with psychologically and scientifically through

78
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:04,320
neuroscience, neuropsychology, sociology, etc. And this mechanization of love is to our own peril.

79
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,920
A case in point is when psychologist Dr. Shannon Currie

80
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:15,360
testified in the spectacle of the death versus her trial. Notwithstanding her necessary role

81
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,240
in evaluating the parties for legal and judicial proceedings, she seemingly played the role of a

82
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,480
high priestess for the general public. When her truths are absolute, especially in matters of

83
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,640
romance and love. Of course, neither Currie nor anyone else explicitly states this. But what

84
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,000
matters for critical analysis is what is not said over what is formally proclaimed.

85
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,000
Society tacitly accepts what public-facing psychologists like Currie or more politically

86
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,360
Jordan Peterson says to be truths about being as such, that is ontology, the study of the fundamental

87
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,360
nature of reality. The psychologization of existence is distinctly manifest in our times.

88
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,800
So when a psychologist makes claims on love or politics, for instance, we subliminally accept

89
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,960
these as metaphysical truths. i.e. when Currie was a guest on Lex Friedman's podcast,

90
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,320
she went on to describing falling in love as being high on heroin due to the chemicals pumping in

91
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,680
your brain. Since she does not stipulate her statements with, this is only a neuropsychological

92
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:37,040
view, we implicitly take her views to be absolute and boil down love to be a neuroscience of sorts.

93
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,960
There is no room for the unknown and no for the speculations that are allowed, or worse,

94
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,560
are considered a waste of time if they don't serve the aforementioned love-industrial complex.

95
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,920
Footnote, I'm not criticizing Dr. Shannon Currie as she doesn't need to include this caveat in

96
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,480
every public conversation. Expecting her to do so would be unreasonable. Unlike Jordan Peterson,

97
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,400
she never claims to be more than a psychologist. However, I only point out the error of our

98
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,040
cultural zeitgeist. Her case serves as an example of this phenomenon.

99
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,040
End footnote. It was Fyodor Dostoevsky who critically delineated the phenomenon of

100
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,600
psychologizing the human condition best. In the Brother's Karamazov, during Dimitri Karamazov's

101
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,560
trial, after being accused of patricide for murdering his father, Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov's

102
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,840
defendant Dimitri's attorney, Fetkovic, says he was forewarned in St. Petersburg and I quote,

103
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:48,480
that I shouldn't counter here as my opponent a deep and most subtle psychologist who has by this

104
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,520
quality long acquired by merit and a special reputation in our still young judicial world

105
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:03,280
and continues sadonically, but profound as psychology is, it's a knife that cut both ways,

106
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,200
end quote. In other words, psychology allows us to interpret the same facts in different ways

107
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,360
or in a way that suits our pre-held beliefs. Ergo, we should be wary of treating the discipline

108
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,280
as a whole form of truth because it too, like all human practices, is placed within an ideological

109
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:28,000
structure. During Dostoevsky's time, forensic psychology was a discipline in nascent forms

110
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,360
and he had a great interest in how it was practiced in the Russian courts. If he were alive today,

111
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,400
he'd have similar comments about the depth be her trial. He wouldn't find fault with science

112
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,960
or the practice of psychology. In fact, he'd load the findings of psychoanalysis,

113
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,160
not a Ben A. Dostoevsky heavily influenced Sigmund Freud with his theories. Yet he would be critical

114
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,680
of ego psychology, today's prevalent form practice in the western world. And being the

115
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,440
romantic Dostoevsky is, he'd find the desire to reduce the human condition to an essence

116
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:13,040
within the bounds of any academic discipline as an eye. The point being is, yes, love is a

117
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,240
psychological phenomenon, but it is that and much more. To love in all its beauty and terror is the

118
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,200
epitome of human existence. So if there's one thing philosophy needs to tackle, it's what love entails.

119
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,600
Or the rest, whether or not artificial general intelligence is possible, whether capitalism

120
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,920
or socialism is the viable system for our times comes afterwards. What is love is the question

121
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,600
worth asking till the end of time.
