1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
Hey everyone, welcome to my May 2023 book haul video. This one in particular, I'm gonna be quite happy.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,720
My frugal ass is gonna be quite happy.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,560
Specifically because of this pile here. I've got more books, but this pile here is

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,880
is making my frugal ass very happy given that all of this costed just I think less than $20.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,200
So I got some some great books here, and I only paid 20 bucks for all of this thanks to

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,240
secondhand shopping that I went with with with a few friends. In fact, I looked up this sociology book.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,960
It's just like a kind of like not a textbook really, but more as the title suggests the key concepts

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,760
by Rotolidge. It was on Amazon for 35 bucks. I got this for less than five dollars, I think so

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,560
that is fantastic. I

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,160
highly highly recommend secondhand book shopping. It's not really something I've done a lot given that some of the books that I do buy

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,400
to be rather

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
what's it would not not as popular

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,760
as some like let's say a Jane Austen or a Charles Dickens.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,960
So it's kind of hard to find exactly what I want outside of buying it from from Amazon or some

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
large bookseller.

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,640
But man, what I really do enjoy about secondhand book shopping is that kind of like spontaneity where you just pick up great books by

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,080
authors that you've been reading for a while and then you get it for like two bucks. It's fantastic.

18
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,200
Okay, let's start off. The first book is I've already

19
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,960
started this book as you can see from the bookmark. You actually can't see that. There you go.

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,000
It's Alan Kazupanchek's What Is Sex?

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,800
Man, I've only read like what 10 pages so far because I'm trying really quite slowly and really

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,440
really

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,560
led the idea to settle in me because

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,080
you know

25
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,640
sexuality, sex, these words are very loaded terms, but they're kind of the philosophical

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,720
and even ontological approach Alan Kazupanchek is taking in this book.

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:08,240
It's it's at least for me being a neo-fight. It seems rather unorthodox and I'm trying to like let the ideas really settle

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,240
and

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,240
kind of battle with them in some sense and

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,560
in fact, I'll be doing a book review on this for sure because I think it's a topic worth discussing

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
particularly given the current political climate.

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,880
The next book is now, you know, okay, I'll take both books out. In fact, Todd McGovern, his

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,680
Emancipation After Hegel and his other book Capitalism and Desire. This book, I've read parts of it,

34
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,120
but I want to get through the whole thing. This one, I haven't and man, I am excited for this because

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,440
so for instance, here's a review that Slavoj Zizek wrote on this book Emancipation After Hegel. Here's what he said.

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:59,520
This is the book we were waiting for after long years of being bombarded by Hegel as a clotted liberal whose last word is recognition.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
With Todd McGovern,

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
the revolutionary Hegel is back.

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,200
However, it is not the old Marxist Hegel, but the Hegel After Marx.

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,200
The Hegel who makes us aware that revolution is an open and risk process

41
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,200
which necessarily entails catastrophic failures.

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,520
Hegel's problem, how to save the legacy of the French Revolution after its breakdown is our problem today.

43
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,920
How to save the project of radical emancipation

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,640
after the catastrophe of starvinism in a truly democratic country.

45
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:43,920
Emancipation After Hegel would be reprinted in hundreds of thousands of copies and distributed for free to all students.

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,480
Read this book or ignore it at your own risk.

47
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,920
I really like the last sentence because generally Zizek isn't a very kind of prescriptive thinker.

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,160
He never tells you what to do. He's more like a he's a critique and an analyst and

49
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,800
the fact that he said read this book or ignore it at your own risk, it gives very

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Jordan Peterson vibes, in fact.

51
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,800
But now I certainly am going to get to this soon. In fact, I think after

52
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,360
too much to read, but I think after what is sex,

53
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm going to read the emancipation after Hegel, not really even for the political aspects of it, but

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,440
man, I've been so

55
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,280
just obsessed with this idea of contradiction the past couple of months.

56
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
It's been taking up all of my thinking

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:33,960
to probably an unhealthy level because I'm trying to analyze everything via that lens of Hegelian contradiction.

58
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay, so yeah, that's that book and then of course

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,400
capitalism and desire.

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,520
One of my, I'd say one of my personal goals in life, kind of like a dream is to get

61
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,400
Tom McGovern on my podcast and discuss this book

62
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,720
and particularly

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
let him elucidate as to why

64
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,160
Marxists really need to take psychoanalysis seriously.

65
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,960
So I'm gonna, yeah, try and work towards that and aspire towards that, but I think

66
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,600
I haven't even reached out to him yet, but before I do reach out, I think I need to attune myself more with this work and give it a bit more time

67
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
before having a conversation with him.

68
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,400
And the next book is Adrian Johnston's Džek's Ontology.

69
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,080
This is also something, obviously, given that I'm a huge Džek here.

70
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,600
I would certainly want to read soon, although I think this book is gonna wait till the end of the year

71
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,720
because I want to get through some of Tom McGovern's and Zupanček's work.

72
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,280
And you know, given that Džek is this huge figure,

73
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Goliath of a figure in the

74
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,040
Slovenian school of, Slovenian philosophers, you know, Džek,

75
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,440
Zupanček, and in fact, I shouldn't even say that I should say

76
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,240
more of the kind of the, these new Hegelians, the way people like McGovern or Adrian Johnston

77
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
or of course Džek.

78
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,960
Džek is such a daunting, towering figure that we tend to focus only on his work.

79
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,320
So I want to try and focus a bit more on the other thinkers.

80
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,360
Zupanček, McGovern, Johnston, before, not long before, why I'm also paying attention to Džek's work.

81
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,920
It's also the fact that Džek is a prolific writer, so he just writes so much.

82
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,240
Okay, I think I went through all of that. Yes. So now let's get to my other book pile.

83
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,440
All of these were not really planned purchases. It's the best part of

84
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,920
you know, going secondhand book shopping, you just pick up whatever's there.

85
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,920
Yep, The Prophet by Khaled Gibran, my friend who I went with, she told me,

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,080
she in fact read this book and she told me she hated it.

87
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,920
But I do know some people really, really enjoy this book and it's kind of a very popular book.

88
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,000
So I probably won't read it this year. Let's be honest, I'm reading some other stuff, but

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,760
it's just always good to have in the collection. Ah, Jen Austen's Persuasions. I watched the film on Netflix.

90
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Wasn't impressed, wasn't impressed, because to be honest, I did quite like Pride and Prejudice.

91
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,240
I thought it was quite good. But Persuasions, it wasn't all that good.

92
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:14,680
The next book is Charles Dickens Great Expectations. This is, yeah, I want to get to this.

93
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:22,520
Dickens, man, I think it's kind of hard because I really do want to spend at least six months

94
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,920
getting through most of Charles Dickens's work, particularly because I think,

95
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,320
even though I've only read Hard Times and what's the other one?

96
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,440
I've read one other Dickens book. Doesn't matter. Hard Times for sure, but there's one on the book

97
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,800
I've read. I feel like a lot of his thinking, I mean, obviously he's a literary figure, but

98
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:53,800
at a philosophical level, at a sociological level, what he tries to delineate in his books

99
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,040
is kind of what I try to theorize on in society and make sense of. So I gotta take him more seriously.

100
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,000
And then another Jen Austen book, Sense and Sensibility. Honestly, I don't even know

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,600
Jen Austen wrote a book called Sense and Sensibility. Yeah, I only picked it up when I saw

102
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,800
her name and I really liked Jen Austen. So, oh, Charlotte Bronte's Jen Air. So

103
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,800
is that how it's pronounced? Jen Air? Okay, this is really interesting. My friend, Tess, who,

104
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,720
I don't think she minds me mentioning her name. She's been reading this book right now and she

105
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,120
recently, I haven't, obviously, I love, love, love Wuthering Heights. So Charlotte Bronte's sister,

106
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,360
Emily Bronte's book, her magnum opus, let's say. And therefore, I really want to get to

107
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,720
Jen Air, too, or the Bronte sisters. I think that they're brilliant. So from this book,

108
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,160
she shared this quote with me and I thought it was excellent. It's exactly why I like the Bronte's,

109
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:00,760
because they're so, man, I like how crude and in some sense, so violent their writing is.

110
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:08,200
It just, it's so, it's such good writing. So here's a line by, I think it's Jane saying this and

111
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:15,480
she says, so Tess shared this with me. She says, I am not an angel. I asserted and I will not be one

112
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:23,880
till I die. I will be myself, Mr. Rochester. You must neither expect nor exact anything

113
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,720
so let's seal off me. Let me actually change the screen so you could read it too if

114
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,120
so let's seal off me for you will not get it any more than I shall get it of you. So this is a

115
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,760
small excerpt from Jen Air and I kind of tweeted it and I thought that was so good. I thought it was

116
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,960
so good and I even commented the divine feminists cringe. It's yet another patriarchal idea that

117
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:52,680
harms women. I totally agree. I am not a fan of any of this idealization of women as abstract figures.

118
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,440
In fact, that's why I like, I think, even Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights because it just shows,

119
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,080
well, love it, it's violence, but also the characters, they're such complex characters and

120
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:12,440
it shows a dark side of both Heathcliff and is it Elizabeth? My god, I forgot. Yeah, and Elizabeth,

121
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,920
it shows both the beauty and the ugly of these characters, which for me is what great literature

122
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,680
does. And last but not least is this book here, The Sociology Key Concepts. I'll probably never

123
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:31,080
read it. It's just more like a reference book that I'll probably use it as. And yeah, that's kind

124
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,640
of it. Those are the books for this book haul. In terms of quantity, a bit more books than

125
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:46,120
per usual. The recent being is because of, again, my great little second hand book shopping

126
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,200
thing I did with my friends, which I'm really happy about. Alrighty, thanks for watching. I hope

127
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,760
I, as per usual, gave you a few ideas, put a few books or authors in your mind, in your head

128
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,120
that they'll hopefully be an impetus for you to go read these authors. But just if you're

129
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,960
into philosophy like me, I would highly, highly recommend looking into the work of Todd McGovern.

130
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,040
He is fantastic. And he also has a podcast. Let me pull that out too, in fact, while they're added.

131
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:27,880
It's on Spotify. It's called Why Theory. It is really, really good, this podcast here.

132
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,160
Why Theory goes through so many concepts and I've kind of been binge listening. I was going to say

133
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,600
binge watching, but it's actually binge listening, this podcast. Sorry for the abrupt ending there.

134
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,080
I clicked stop recording on OBS by mistake. Now, the proper ending. Thanks for watching. I'll see

135
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,640
you in the next book haul video or the next video, which probably is going to be a little, little

136
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,960
vlog slash analysis on Character Guard from this book, either or perhaps it's Magnum Opus

137
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:05,240
on Bodom, which is going to be an interesting topic to discuss. Alrighty, see you in the next one. Cheers.
