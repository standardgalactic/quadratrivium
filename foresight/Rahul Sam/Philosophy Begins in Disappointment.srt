00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Simon, you claim that philosophy does not begin in an experience of wonder as ancient tradition

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,640
contends, but rather, I think, with the indeterminate but palpable sense that something desired has not

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:22,480
been fulfilled, that a fantastic effort has failed. Philosophy begins in disappointment. It's one of

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:30,160
your famous lines, I think. Firstly, would you want to comment on this excerpt, but also,

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,040
perhaps, elucidate on what you mean by philosophy begins in disappointment?

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,320
Why is the world wonderful or is the world disappointing?

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,680
More the latter, isn't it?

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:57,600
Oh, right. If philosophy is thinking, is it time in thought, then we have to begin from

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:07,520
disappointment, it seems to me. It's a good way of making a contrast with a view which is

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:17,520
it's just a popular view, the idea of wonder, because it sounds cool, but if you look at the

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:26,960
sources for it, it's a view that Aristotle ascribes to those people that came way before him,

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:36,000
the physiologi, philosophers of nature. He thought they experienced wonder in relationship to

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,280
nature, but Aristotle doesn't claim that he experienced his wonder. It's a view that was

14
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:52,960
already out of fashion by the time of the fifth century BC. The idea there is that the modern

15
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,360
world is most certainly an experience of disappointment, and that's where you have to begin.

16
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:08,240
It's not where you end, so people often get, are you the disappointment guy? No,

17
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,200
philosophy begins in disappointment, it doesn't end in disappointment. Well, that's where it begins.

18
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,480
I don't say as much these days as I used to, but I still think it's right.

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:32,240
Yeah, indeed. Do you think that there's a very apocal way of thinking, I guess, but

20
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,880
that in terms of times when philosophy becomes most pertinent, for instance,

21
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,440
Jacques, who you've written polemics with, he claims that now we live in this time where these

22
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,880
grand metaphysical questions are coming back into our culture, kind of like the time that,

23
00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:00,000
let's say, the German idealist went through, or do you think that there are these periods in human

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,480
history where philosophy becomes most pertinent, or that it's more ahistorical or acontextual as to

25
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,560
how philosophical development or progress, if you could call that, takes place?

26
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:23,680
Good question, very difficult question to answer. It's hard to find progress in philosophy,

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,280
the questions that we're asking are the same questions that the Plato and Aristotle asked,

28
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:39,280
so we don't have answers for them, so you might want to say philosophy is a series of perennial

29
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,520
questions without answers, and that's a good way of thinking about it. Philosophy is a movement

30
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:58,400
into perplexity about basic issues, and sophistry or ideology always claims to have an answer.

31
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:07,200
This is what this means, this is this, and so on and so forth, so if you claim to know, then you are

32
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:16,720
selling something, you're selling snake oil or whatever it might be, so one way of looking

33
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,360
is that philosophy really exhibits their progress over thousands of years, and then it's also where

34
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,360
do you even say it begins? Does it begin with the Greeks? Does it begin with? I think you lost

35
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,760
you there for a bit, Simon. Yeah, I think that was at my end, that something happens in this building

36
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:43,120
I'm in, that only happens during business hours, but normally by this time it's pretty, so anyway,

37
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:51,040
but I've got another Wi-Fi. Oh, great, right now, that's all fine. After doing podcasts for almost

38
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,120
two years with people all over the world, I'm kind of used to this now, so it's totally fine.

39
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,960
So we might get another breakage like that. Anyway, I was saying, so philosophy exhibits

40
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:08,000
no progress on fundamental issues, we could say, and then it's a question of opinion really, I mean

41
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:18,560
it's anybody that claims to have some special insight into this is lying. There does seem to be a

42
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,960
connection between, I mean, philosophy seems to be particularly creative at sudden critical

43
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:37,600
points in history, so we can think about, you know, the 13th century and the rise of scholasticism

44
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,760
and that, which comes out of that, that confluence of thinking in the Arabic world,

45
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,800
Greek thinking in the Arabic world, and then that finding its feet in Paris and Bologna and the

46
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,240
beginnings of universities and that, or you could say the 17th century, the rise of the scientific

47
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:09,280
view of things, which is also a period of intense conflicts, war, and we could, if we look at the

48
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:19,200
20th century, there's no doubt that, I mean, the first and second world wars were not great,

49
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:28,240
but they did provide stimulus for philosophical thinking, and which itself is quite interesting,

50
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:37,120
first world war, you get Wittgenstein, Rosenzweig, Lukacs, Heidegger for sure, and the second world

51
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,840
war really produces generations of philosophers that are really, you know, doing high-level

52
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:52,000
interesting work. Where are we now? I don't know, I think there's a renewed interest in philosophy,

53
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,480
and, you know, I've been trying to help that along in my little way over the years, but it's,

54
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,520
and in many ways the, in a way, the internet has been kind to philosophy in the way that it's been

55
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,240
unkind to the novel, which was the, you know, that was the cultural form that dominated the world

56
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,160
that I grew up in, people read novels, now they watch Netflix series, and maybe they've got some

57
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:30,720
space for short form, you know, short form blogs and articles and things like that, ideas which are

58
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:39,120
more easily digested, so perhaps it's a, it's a good time for philosophy, but it's not a good time

59
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:47,360
institutionally, and philosophy is, you know, there are two different views of philosophy, one view is

60
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,680
that, you know, philosophy is just thinking, and it can take place anywhere, and philosophy should

61
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,920
be in the streets, and that's fine, and that goes all the way back to the cynics, and, you know,

62
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:07,200
thinking in public in ancient Greece, often without clothes on, masturbating and living in

63
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,000
barrels and doing crazy things, another view is that philosophy is something which has always

64
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,680
required an institutional framework, and that's, you know, that's what the academy was for Plato,

65
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,600
the Lyceum for Aristotle, and so on and so forth, so the institutional framework for the last

66
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,640
couple of hundred years has been the university, and is interesting philosophy coming out of

67
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,400
universities at this point, I don't think so, I really don't, there's a lot of smart people, but

68
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:46,240
not really much happening, so that would be one kind of half answer to that difficult question.
