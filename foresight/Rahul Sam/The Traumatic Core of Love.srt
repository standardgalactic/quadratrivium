1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
And I know you don't like compliments, but I'm an evil guy, so I'm going to compliment

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,480
you.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,600
My favorite theories of love ever since I started reading philosophy was Alain Bajos,

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,640
and then it was Todd McGavin's.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:19,640
And now I'd unequivocally say it's yours, the way you've articulated it in your book.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,080
It is, I don't even know where else to go from there, as in the way you laid down the

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,240
entirety of love around like loss and this dying and negativity.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:36,000
But just again, I know you've spoken about this in a couple of places, but yeah, through

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,400
your framework of let's say, or worldview of depressive realism and negative philosophy,

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
what is love?

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,600
Thank you.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,120
So love is comprehended in everything else from the negative perspective as the based

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,440
on negativity, trauma, love, lack and all of those who love as dramatic and at the same

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:13,120
time impossible in its nature, love as suicidal, self-destructive and the very connection between

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,800
others.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:25,160
What structures the bond, the romantic bond, love relationship is the rupture between us,

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,800
which destroys us at the same time and creates the connection.

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,720
So when you reach the core of love, it hurts and you die.

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,480
And maybe the other person also dies.

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,000
And the healthy relationship was considered the healthy relationship in psychotherapeutic

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
society.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,960
I think it's just concealing enough, this painful, impossible core of love for us not to notice

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
it.

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:03,600
But I'm sure people know that healthy relationship, they're very boring and they don't feel like

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
love.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
That's the problem.

27
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,960
Like you can have it.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,360
It's not a problem to have a healthy relationship, it's just super boring and it's not love.

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,840
What we call love, unfortunately, is just a very cruel joke.

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,560
It's when you're dying into it, when you encounter the impossibility of it, it's the only way

31
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:35,440
to feel it, which is super horrifying, especially for the Valentine's Day and the revelation.

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,800
The isolation also doesn't help.

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:47,720
The other is the one who hurts and we only feel them in a way, I think, that they hurt

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
us.

35
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,640
The other is the one that hurts in us.

36
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:58,680
The isolation would be also not the protection from it, maybe protection, but also a certain

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,040
type of social bond that also hurts the other hurt.

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:12,000
You can constitute relation with them by isolating yourself from them and being isolated, it's

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,280
still the condition that hurts because you're isolated precisely.

40
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,560
You also feel the bond with the other through pain.

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:33,720
The attachment theory, which gives the hope of healthy relationship, of healthy attachment type.

42
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,480
I think that in each principle, it's like we hope that the healthy one doesn't hurt.

43
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,160
It's the best one.

44
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:51,480
And I think that it hurts, but when you just reduce it, conceal it enough.

45
00:03:51,560 --> 00:04:02,200
The pain, when it starts to be boring, then it's just possible to bearable, but it just

46
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,400
doesn't feel that there is a connection anymore.

47
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,760
It's presently bearable because it's not the attachment that might be concealed.

48
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,120
Yeah.

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,040
So Peter Rollins, I didn't mention him too.

50
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,920
He too really influenced my thinking on the idea of love around loss.

51
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,600
So for him, he articulates this quite well in the previous conversations we had.

52
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
He said that, which I love this.

53
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,520
He says communion is building a community around a shared loss.

54
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,000
And well, I'll just put it this way.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,960
What are your just intimations on that idea that loving is kind of feeling this loss,

56
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,840
ontological loss within us?

57
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,640
And yeah, does that sit along with your philosophy too?

58
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,120
Or would you radicalize that even further?

59
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:06,720
Yeah, Peter Rollins distinguishes, which is great between community and communion.

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,840
Community would be more a conventional way of people getting together because they share

61
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,280
something, like they share enemies or a certain goal, a certain identification,

62
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,720
they have something in common.

63
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,600
He doesn't like it and he suggests what he creates is communion.

64
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:32,240
When people share nothing, loss, luck, and this would be authentic relation.

65
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,320
I would radicalize it.

66
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:46,960
I think in a way that presents itself as this is a proper way of how things supposed to be.

67
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:57,680
And I would think of trying to think of a therapy as the communion instead of treatment,

68
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,040
instead of fixing someone, instead of hierarchy of bringing to a certain healthier

69
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,120
conditional improvement, like the communion, sharing nothing.

70
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,360
There still has hope to it that this is a happy thing, the way it's supposed to be,

71
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,800
if one thinks about love in these terms.

72
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,040
It gives the hope that there is a way, what we have to do and that it brings harmony

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,240
something, that there is a luck and we need to connect through this luck.

74
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,520
And then it's going to be authentic, equalized with a harmonious, happy relationship.

75
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,200
To be honest, I don't think there is happy.

76
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,000
Like this is harmonious relationship.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,560
I think it's also one of the ways, one of the illusions, how we would like, we would like

78
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,920
to hope that it exists, but it doesn't.

79
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,200
And still talking about how it should be done, it's still trying.

80
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,280
We are connecting, I think, ontologically through it.

81
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
There is no other ways to connect.

82
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,960
It's not what we have to do.

83
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,640
It's like maybe comforting illusion in a way.

84
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,000
It's like training a cat who are impossible to train to sit, for example.

85
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,040
And telling the cat to sit when the cat is already sitting.

86
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,360
You know, it sits, it starts to sit.

87
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
You tell it to sit and you have illusion that the cat obeys,

88
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,440
where it's just your operation upon the cat to comfort you.

89
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,480
This is a similar thing with what we have to do with love.

90
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,280
It's already there in a horrifying way.

91
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,200
There is nothing you can do or you have to do to make it better or to do it properly.

92
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,000
It's not the problem.

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,360
It's just different comprehension, maybe.

94
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,880
Either you discuss love and trying to figure out the correct form of love that would bring

95
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,560
happiness, won't hurt anyone or hurt less, or you just horrified of love.

96
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,240
That's what I'm rather young.

97
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:27,520
It's presence in inevitable nature and a horror of it without trying to anymore escaping into

98
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,160
how to fix something or what's the correct form of attachment.

99
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,520
Just horrified without escaping from it.

100
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:44,240
And I'm not saying that this is how the proper way to think about it is the certain state of

101
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,120
my existence.

102
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,240
Yeah, I do like what Jojak says.

103
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,080
I think in one of his, it's probably in a documentary, in one of the Pervod's guides

104
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,960
documentaries, he says that love is a disaster, it's a catastrophe.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,240
But then there's also when I'm not in love, I'm sad.

106
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,200
So it's like, whereas you're saying both when you're in love and not in love,

107
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,280
you're going to be sad, you're going to be irregardless.

108
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,080
Just face the catastrophe, so to speak.

109
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Yeah, so I think that the, and Kierkegaard, one who knew that you both get married and

110
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,920
don't get married, you regret.

111
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
We have the hope for being saved.

112
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,560
Simone de Boire talks about women who treat men as the form of salvation,

113
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,600
the most immediate one.

114
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,680
When you're alone, you're expecting for men to save you.

115
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:43,600
And one, this disillusion once you're in a relationship, because it's, you're in a

116
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,200
relationship, but no one is saving you.

117
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,120
Encounter the horror of being in a relationship, being disillusioned in this salvation.

118
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,840
It's not heaven.

119
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,120
Didn't work.

120
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,480
So you, once you are not in a relationship, you expect to get rid of the horror of being

121
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
alone while you're in a relationship.

122
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,720
And in relationship, the other way around, you expect to be saved of the horror of

123
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,760
relationship, ending relationship, or proceeding to find someone else better,

124
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,880
something like it.

125
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,800
But it's the horror every time.

126
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,480
It just, for a while, you remember the previous horror, the previous type of horror.

127
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,080
And you think that this is improvement.

128
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,320
It helps you to hold on for a while.

129
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
Then you forget about it.

130
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,600
It's like encounter a horror of this situation, of relationship, for example.

131
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,280
And then you're hoping for opposite salvation in the end of relationship.

132
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,480
It just never comes.

133
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,240
So it's both horror of, when we are in relationship, we get dressed from the

134
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,280
previous type of horror and then the dialectics forever.

135
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,920
Or you just get adapted to a certain type of horror.

136
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,040
Being alone or being with someone, the tolerable horror.

137
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,240
And you settle.
