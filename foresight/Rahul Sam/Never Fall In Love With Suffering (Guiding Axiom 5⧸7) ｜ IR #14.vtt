00:00.000 --> 00:04.440
Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the interval and podcast and

00:04.440 --> 00:10.200
today I'm gonna read out guiding axiom number five which is a part of this sub

00:10.200 --> 00:14.160
series that I've been doing where I've been reading out these axioms that I

00:14.160 --> 00:18.960
wrote for my newsletter the unhappy man links down below in the description and

00:18.960 --> 00:24.000
as I was writing down these axioms I realized I'm in fact setting up a

00:24.000 --> 00:31.760
framework for sounds like someone just got shot outside that's fine we don't

00:31.760 --> 00:36.520
live in America this is really a people don't get shot here

00:36.520 --> 00:41.960
came back to it when I was laying down these axioms I realized that oh yeah

00:41.960 --> 00:46.000
this is a framework for all of my creative work if it only makes sense to

00:46.000 --> 00:50.640
read them out in this podcast given that this podcast is a part of my creative

00:50.640 --> 00:55.760
work I'm sorry if that sounds pretentious and also it allows me to have a

00:55.760 --> 01:00.360
bit of structured thinking and writing I think is the best way to do that today's

01:00.360 --> 01:06.880
axiom axiom number five is undoubtedly my favorite one it's never fallen love

01:06.880 --> 01:10.920
with your suffering or well I said never fall in love with suffering as a

01:10.920 --> 01:15.360
category and the reason it's important for me is because from all the axioms

01:15.360 --> 01:22.200
I've laid down in many ways these axioms are an antidote to my flaws or things

01:22.200 --> 01:26.480
that I see are shortcomings in my character be it morally spiritually

01:26.480 --> 01:31.160
existentially whatever you want to call it and that's why I'm writing down

01:31.160 --> 01:36.320
these axioms so that I don't let these shortcomings in my character of who am

01:36.320 --> 01:42.720
as a person impact the work I do and falling in love with suffering my god

01:42.720 --> 01:48.840
I am I'm kind of ashamed how how vain it is when I really understood this

01:48.840 --> 01:54.840
concept thanks a lot to Slavoj Zizek I think it's reading his stuff and

01:54.840 --> 01:58.360
listening to his lectures that really influenced me as to why it's a bad idea

01:58.360 --> 02:04.280
to fall in love with suffering and most of us subconsciously or unconsciously do

02:04.280 --> 02:09.440
this therefore it's it's important to be cognizant of this phenomena without

02:09.440 --> 02:14.240
further ado enough of a prelude let's get to the axiom so yes as I said it's

02:14.240 --> 02:21.080
the unhappy man guiding axiom number five never fall in love with suffering and

02:21.080 --> 02:26.600
of course I've got this painting by Goya this is an interesting one of cryos

02:26.600 --> 02:33.200
crucified this is before I think he went through his face of depression but of

02:33.200 --> 02:38.480
course suffering is very much connected to the archetypal story of the western

02:38.840 --> 02:44.080
collective unconscious let's say of the crucifixion that's why I decided to

02:44.080 --> 02:49.160
pick this any kirkard guardian is familiar with the captivating admission

02:49.160 --> 02:55.200
in either or my melancholy is the most faithful mistress I have known what

02:55.200 --> 03:00.680
wonder then that I love her in return most of us of the existentialist elk

03:00.680 --> 03:05.680
have fully bought into the dogma of the depressed yet perspicacious philosopher

03:06.400 --> 03:12.040
for us all great truths lack profundity if not written in a shopenhari and

03:12.040 --> 03:18.280
pessimism about our condition the misery of existence is what those with great

03:18.280 --> 03:24.320
intelligence and deep hearts have come to see to not see this verity is nothing

03:24.320 --> 03:30.400
but naivety at least this is the bullshit we tell ourselves to be depressed or

03:30.400 --> 03:36.400
suffer needlessly as far from the romantic beauty we give to it none of it

03:36.400 --> 03:41.600
makes one so deeper and inspires philosophically penetrating poetry or

03:41.600 --> 03:48.360
the staff skin literature in fact when I read my nonsensical journaling written

03:48.360 --> 03:54.920
during the low points I see it as nothing but vain egotistical pabula which

03:54.920 --> 03:59.880
is why I stopped journaling it's a waste of time and better drinking away your

03:59.880 --> 04:08.200
sorrows this is a joke for them but beyond a stentatious vanity we all dwell

04:08.200 --> 04:12.960
with our misery purely to feel something we often deliberately seek

04:12.960 --> 04:18.360
pathological relationships only because the melodramatic pain of love reminds

04:18.360 --> 04:23.600
us of our humanness better to feel pain than nothing at all

04:23.600 --> 04:32.080
OS Dostoevsky wrote if he human beings does not find means he will contrive

04:32.080 --> 04:37.320
destruction and chaos will contrive suffering of all sorts only to gain

04:37.320 --> 04:44.200
his point notes from underground and of course being willing to suffer through

04:44.200 --> 04:49.760
love particularly romantic tells us of our goodness of our higher virtues in

04:49.760 --> 04:55.520
being authentically self-sacrificial for another such as why Nietzsche wrote

04:55.520 --> 05:02.320
ultimately it is a desire not the desire that we love your granival I must

05:02.320 --> 05:09.600
admit that I am ashamed of how pathetic we are as a species having said that I

05:09.600 --> 05:14.000
see why modern people lust after suffering as they are given the

05:14.000 --> 05:18.960
impossible choice of contrived pseudo happiness in the form of new age self

05:19.000 --> 05:24.680
help which you all know is rife with empty patitudes I bullshit and the

05:24.680 --> 05:30.040
finger wagging pull yourself up by your bootstraps heartless American stoicism

05:30.040 --> 05:36.720
it seems that we're stuck in this binary the modern age is an era of nihilism so

05:36.720 --> 05:41.280
as Nietzsche the man who explored the symptom to his ultimate road read from

05:41.280 --> 05:45.800
a distant planet the majestical script of our earthly existence would perhaps

05:45.960 --> 05:51.000
seduce the reader to the conclusion that the earth was the aesthetic planet

05:51.000 --> 05:57.080
parks alone an outposts of discontented arrogant and nasty creatures who

05:57.080 --> 06:03.400
harbored a deep disgust for themselves for the world for all life and hurt

06:03.400 --> 06:08.400
themselves as much as possible out of pleasure in hurting probably their only

06:08.400 --> 06:13.320
pleasure the passage above is from a skating critique of the aesthetic ideal

06:13.960 --> 06:18.760
the mode of life he pillories has little to do with religious asceticism but

06:18.760 --> 06:25.080
say but rather a cultural zeitgeist despite the characteristic phenomenon

06:25.080 --> 06:30.360
being cross cultural for instance he would be as equally contemptuous of the

06:30.360 --> 06:36.600
contemporary postmodern stoicism of the ryan holy types or neoliberal western

06:36.600 --> 06:41.240
buddhism that turns a blind eye to the problems of the world and decides to

06:41.240 --> 06:46.440
inflict suffering on oneself for the pleasure of it ie cold showers fasting

06:46.440 --> 06:51.880
crossfit etc irrespective of religious connotations all such modes of being

06:51.880 --> 06:58.280
manifest a drive towards the ascetic ideal so his sentiments are apt to any

06:58.280 --> 07:05.160
pseudo suffering we create purely to inject artificial meaning into our barren

07:05.160 --> 07:09.640
desolate veins whether in the form of modern self-help cults with their

07:09.720 --> 07:15.320
unending self-flagellation or a morbid romantic relationship that's conspicuously

07:15.320 --> 07:21.560
making everyone suffer we desire meaning perhaps the intrinsic human reality is

07:21.560 --> 07:26.920
meaninglessness and the incompleteness of life therefore we ought to be cognizant

07:26.920 --> 07:32.200
of how we respond to our predicament and one can only live authentically once

07:32.200 --> 07:37.880
his datum is confronted in my view the only true antidote to meaninglessness

07:37.880 --> 07:42.040
or nihilism of our culture is love but that's a whole other essay or book

07:43.880 --> 07:48.840
listen on suffering on suffering as a psychological phenomenon i find affinity

07:48.840 --> 07:55.160
with the zhezhekyan sentiments on the matter footnote influenced by zhak lakon's concept of

07:55.160 --> 08:00.840
joystones and the Freudian death drive zhezhek made the following point in in his books and

08:00.840 --> 08:07.400
lectures paraphrasing don't fall in love with your suffering never presume that your suffering is

08:07.400 --> 08:14.120
in itself proof of your authenticity renunciation of pleasure can easily turn into pleasure of

08:14.120 --> 08:20.600
renunciation itself back to the essay pleasure never satiates us as there's only so much of it

08:20.600 --> 08:26.760
one can enjoy therefore we seek the pleasure beyond pleasure and willfully suffer for an

08:26.760 --> 08:34.440
ostensibly noble course but in reality this is our yearning to fill the void in life we hope to

08:34.440 --> 08:40.520
overcome the abyss with a deeper spiritual meaning sometimes with a touch of romanticism as we see

08:40.520 --> 08:48.600
in fascism that's elusive for us in the technological age footnote read the question concerning

08:48.600 --> 08:54.920
technology essay by martin heidegger to understand what this age entails when i mean this age i mean

08:54.920 --> 09:00.040
the current age we live in or the technological age to be more specific i'll read that again that's

09:00.040 --> 09:06.120
elusive for us in the technological age where to test have skis this may man has become nothing

09:06.120 --> 09:14.120
but a piano key martyrdom for instance typifies his drive within us despite the words of tomology

09:14.120 --> 09:20.920
a martyr is not a purely religious individual or some fundamentalist fanatic to a certain extent

09:20.920 --> 09:27.400
everyone sees themselves as a martyr from a self-sacrificial parent and a serious employee

09:27.480 --> 09:33.560
working 15 hours a day at a trendy postmodern startup to a nurse working in palliative care

09:35.000 --> 09:41.480
to the martin us the pain of sacrifice and duty gives us that pleasure when the so-called

09:41.480 --> 09:47.880
worldly pleasures generally a derided term but it shouldn't be are inadequate footnote

09:47.880 --> 09:53.000
pleasure which could be misunderstood by how it's colloquially used in the carnal hedonic sense

09:53.480 --> 09:59.080
may not be the aptus term for this instance but i've decided to stick with it since i'm speaking

09:59.080 --> 10:04.920
in Freudian nomenclature i'll reread that sentence because i feel jumping to the footnotes tend to

10:04.920 --> 10:08.760
break the flow of things but i kind of have to read out the footnotes because they are related

10:08.760 --> 10:14.120
to what i'm writing to the martyr in us the pain of sacrifice and duty gives us that pleasure

10:14.120 --> 10:20.120
when the so-called worldly pleasures generally a derided term but it shouldn't be are inadequate

10:21.080 --> 10:27.560
or as G. K. Chesterton wrote pessimism is not in being tired of evil but in being tired of good

10:28.200 --> 10:34.920
despair does not lie in being wary of suffering but in being wary of joy the everlasting man

10:34.920 --> 10:39.400
of course none of this implies we shouldn't take upon actual responsibility in life and

10:39.400 --> 10:45.560
carry the world's burdens nor does it mean above all that love is free of a sword and fire

10:46.360 --> 10:52.760
Alan Burjou observed this is in his book in praise of love by the way it's a great little book

10:52.760 --> 10:57.960
that i've been recommending to many people it's a lovely read reading that again Alan Burjou

10:57.960 --> 11:03.560
observed that our culture is atypically in trying to sell a safety first concept of love

11:04.440 --> 11:11.320
it is love comprehensively ensured against all risks you will have love but will have assessed

11:11.320 --> 11:17.480
the prospective relationship so thoroughly will have selected your partner so carefully by

11:17.480 --> 11:23.880
switching online by obtaining of course a photo details of his or her tastes date of birth

11:23.880 --> 11:31.640
horoscope signs etc and putting it all in the mix you can tell yourself this is a risk-free option

11:32.520 --> 11:40.200
but he fights back against such safetyism i'm convinced that love cannot be a gift given on

11:40.200 --> 11:47.480
the basis of a complete lack of risk the mythic french online dating service approach reminds

11:47.480 --> 11:53.240
me of the propaganda of the american army when promoting the idea of smart bombs and zero dead

11:53.240 --> 12:00.360
wars in praise of love so we ought to pick up battles and be cognizant of the difference

12:00.360 --> 12:07.480
between sacrifice for higher life-sustaining ideals of love justice etc that bring forth

12:07.560 --> 12:13.960
genuine good and on the other hand suffering for the love of suffering itself the latter is

12:13.960 --> 12:21.880
nothing but vanity and exhibitionism any blind renunciation of pleasure and seeking of suffering

12:21.880 --> 12:28.200
becomes a kind of Machiavellian narcissism worse than what you'd see from a typical more explicit

12:28.200 --> 12:33.560
trump-like narcissists as the former is the ultimate wolf in sheep's clothing

12:34.360 --> 12:41.800
ergo as jujek candidly tells us never fall in love with your suffering suffering as a category

12:42.680 --> 12:49.240
but i'd go a step further and assert never fall in love with suffering as a category period firstly

12:49.240 --> 12:55.080
because it's simply un-pragmatic suffering doesn't make anyone's life better and has no

12:55.080 --> 13:02.120
ennobling qualities in itself secondly and more importantly the fixation of suffering has imbued

13:02.120 --> 13:09.160
unspeakable amounts of evil kiss in point i'm disgusted by how post-modern neoliberals that's

13:09.160 --> 13:16.120
most of us fetishize poverty we implicitly believe there's some deepfound wisdom in the suffering

13:16.120 --> 13:22.520
of the poor that those exploited in the mica mines in india for extortionate makeup products

13:22.520 --> 13:27.640
have a profundity to their souls that we degenerate westerners have lost or we would

13:27.720 --> 13:33.480
salivatingly cite an outdated statistic about bangladeshi people being happier

13:33.480 --> 13:40.120
than rich americans footnote who says happiness is the purpose of life or that it's even something

13:40.120 --> 13:45.880
worth measuring it doesn't matter that they're happier if the rapacious fashion industry aloves

13:45.880 --> 13:52.760
for tragedies like the rana plaza collapse in such moments happiness is an unethical category

13:52.760 --> 13:59.400
it's out of the question but isn't all of this romanticization of poverty at a nonsense isn't it

13:59.400 --> 14:06.040
yet another example of the aforementioned suffering fetish this time despicably manifested in the

14:06.040 --> 14:12.520
political domain i doubt any of us unpretentiously listen to a poor person except to an ideological

14:12.520 --> 14:19.320
lens which tells us what to hear over what the person's truly saying personally whenever i've

14:19.320 --> 14:26.440
spoken to someone struggling to survive and barely making ends meet i see nothing but despondency

14:26.440 --> 14:32.680
pain and resentment not the pristine goodness in the souls of poor folk would prescribe on them

14:33.800 --> 14:39.320
not the wisdom of the heart we'd read about in a charles dickens novel of course dickens knew

14:39.320 --> 14:46.920
this better than all of us i partially blame the misappropriation of the crucifixion for the

14:46.920 --> 14:54.920
fetishism of suffering i'm not surprised as someone deeply enamored by christ the crucifixion

14:54.920 --> 15:01.000
is an infinite superhistorical event happening in the eternal now footnote

15:02.920 --> 15:09.080
i borrow this term from poldtelics book eternal now which encapsulate most of his superlative

15:09.080 --> 15:16.280
theology i highly recommend that book he probably gives the best description of god that i've

15:16.280 --> 15:23.240
ever read in my life and i think he's right he's correct to describe god as the ground of all being

15:24.520 --> 15:31.160
actually i say meditating on it has changed my life or more accurately given me a new one

15:31.800 --> 15:37.560
and i shall expand on the matter in later essays in any case crucified christ is only

15:37.560 --> 15:43.720
part of the christian narrative and we replace the whole with a fragment at great peril we ought to

15:43.720 --> 15:51.160
never forget christ also resurrected as bizarre as that sounds notwithstanding one's religious

15:51.160 --> 15:58.120
beliefs be it atheist or spiritual but not religious all of us think of ourselves as a

15:58.120 --> 16:05.560
suffering christ carrying a cross footnote to understand why i recommend starting with

16:05.560 --> 16:12.600
tom holland's dominion and slavojic's fragile absolutes because as don cupid wrote nobody in

16:12.600 --> 16:18.680
the west can be holy non christian you make hold yourself non christian but the dreams you dream

16:18.680 --> 16:26.120
are still christian dreams since we even migrants to the west like myself dream in christianity

16:26.120 --> 16:31.880
we ought to never rush into glamorizing the suffering christ and instead be searingly

16:31.880 --> 16:37.960
skeptical of our underlying humanistic intentions behind the vinnia of self-sacrificial love

16:37.960 --> 16:46.440
perhaps christ was thinking my dad's a malevolent sedomasticistic son of a bitch who's thrown me

16:46.440 --> 16:53.320
into gratuitous suffering because of a twisted cosmic jurisprudential atonement he's conjured

16:53.320 --> 17:01.800
up ex nihilo at least this is what theologians like william lane craig tell us if christ was the

17:01.800 --> 17:08.360
gold man then for him to say ally ally lamar sabustani my god my god why have you forsaken me

17:09.240 --> 17:16.040
is an unsurprising remark for one to make while being crucified and here as jujek points out

17:16.600 --> 17:22.840
momentarily god himself becomes an atheist it's the negation and even hatred of god

17:22.840 --> 17:29.560
e.g. book of job that makes christianity unique from any other religion and makes our culture

17:29.640 --> 17:36.600
outlandish footnote martin scorsese's silence explores this phenomenon well with the modern

17:36.600 --> 17:44.360
flavor of man's helpless frustration at god and gk chesterton's orthodoxy encapsulates his idea

17:44.360 --> 17:50.760
best from any modern theology i've ever read we see in christianity the utmost palpable story

17:50.760 --> 17:57.720
of existence human suffering can be so unbearable that even god once he comes down to us realizes

17:57.720 --> 18:05.160
he can't bear it and loses faith ergo the separation from god is a part of divinity itself

18:05.160 --> 18:11.080
and it's only the christian god that knows the alienation of being human i go on these detours

18:11.080 --> 18:17.400
only to explicate my view that suffering in itself has no higher soul maturing virtue

18:18.600 --> 18:26.120
we don't have to artificially create and fetishize it as pain tragedy and our happiness are already

18:26.120 --> 18:33.480
concomitant with the vicissitudes of life so despite this newsletter being called the unhappy

18:33.480 --> 18:40.520
man i shall never fall in love with unhappiness and suffering if i ever do i will stop writing

18:41.720 --> 18:47.720
thanks for watching as i said the link to this uh essay is down below in the description if you

18:47.720 --> 18:53.320
do prefer reading it please do check it out but i shall see you in the next one cheers
