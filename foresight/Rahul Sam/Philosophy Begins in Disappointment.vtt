00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
Simon, you claim that philosophy does not begin in an experience of wonder as ancient tradition

00:06.720 --> 00:14.640
contends, but rather, I think, with the indeterminate but palpable sense that something desired has not

00:14.640 --> 00:22.480
been fulfilled, that a fantastic effort has failed. Philosophy begins in disappointment. It's one of

00:22.480 --> 00:30.160
your famous lines, I think. Firstly, would you want to comment on this excerpt, but also,

00:30.160 --> 00:35.040
perhaps, elucidate on what you mean by philosophy begins in disappointment?

00:36.080 --> 00:40.320
Why is the world wonderful or is the world disappointing?

00:41.920 --> 00:43.680
More the latter, isn't it?

00:44.400 --> 00:57.600
Oh, right. If philosophy is thinking, is it time in thought, then we have to begin from

00:57.600 --> 01:07.520
disappointment, it seems to me. It's a good way of making a contrast with a view which is

01:08.480 --> 01:17.520
it's just a popular view, the idea of wonder, because it sounds cool, but if you look at the

01:18.160 --> 01:26.960
sources for it, it's a view that Aristotle ascribes to those people that came way before him,

01:26.960 --> 01:36.000
the physiologi, philosophers of nature. He thought they experienced wonder in relationship to

01:36.000 --> 01:43.280
nature, but Aristotle doesn't claim that he experienced his wonder. It's a view that was

01:43.280 --> 01:52.960
already out of fashion by the time of the fifth century BC. The idea there is that the modern

01:52.960 --> 01:59.360
world is most certainly an experience of disappointment, and that's where you have to begin.

01:59.360 --> 02:08.240
It's not where you end, so people often get, are you the disappointment guy? No,

02:08.240 --> 02:13.200
philosophy begins in disappointment, it doesn't end in disappointment. Well, that's where it begins.

02:17.920 --> 02:22.480
I don't say as much these days as I used to, but I still think it's right.

02:23.200 --> 02:32.240
Yeah, indeed. Do you think that there's a very apocal way of thinking, I guess, but

02:32.800 --> 02:38.880
that in terms of times when philosophy becomes most pertinent, for instance,

02:39.840 --> 02:47.440
Jacques, who you've written polemics with, he claims that now we live in this time where these

02:47.440 --> 02:52.880
grand metaphysical questions are coming back into our culture, kind of like the time that,

02:52.880 --> 03:00.000
let's say, the German idealist went through, or do you think that there are these periods in human

03:00.000 --> 03:08.480
history where philosophy becomes most pertinent, or that it's more ahistorical or acontextual as to

03:09.440 --> 03:14.560
how philosophical development or progress, if you could call that, takes place?

03:15.200 --> 03:23.680
Good question, very difficult question to answer. It's hard to find progress in philosophy,

03:25.520 --> 03:31.280
the questions that we're asking are the same questions that the Plato and Aristotle asked,

03:31.280 --> 03:39.280
so we don't have answers for them, so you might want to say philosophy is a series of perennial

03:40.240 --> 03:45.520
questions without answers, and that's a good way of thinking about it. Philosophy is a movement

03:45.520 --> 03:58.400
into perplexity about basic issues, and sophistry or ideology always claims to have an answer.

03:58.960 --> 04:07.200
This is what this means, this is this, and so on and so forth, so if you claim to know, then you are

04:08.160 --> 04:16.720
selling something, you're selling snake oil or whatever it might be, so one way of looking

04:16.720 --> 04:23.360
is that philosophy really exhibits their progress over thousands of years, and then it's also where

04:23.360 --> 04:29.360
do you even say it begins? Does it begin with the Greeks? Does it begin with? I think you lost

04:29.360 --> 04:33.760
you there for a bit, Simon. Yeah, I think that was at my end, that something happens in this building

04:33.760 --> 04:43.120
I'm in, that only happens during business hours, but normally by this time it's pretty, so anyway,

04:43.120 --> 04:51.040
but I've got another Wi-Fi. Oh, great, right now, that's all fine. After doing podcasts for almost

04:51.040 --> 04:55.120
two years with people all over the world, I'm kind of used to this now, so it's totally fine.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.960
So we might get another breakage like that. Anyway, I was saying, so philosophy exhibits

05:00.960 --> 05:08.000
no progress on fundamental issues, we could say, and then it's a question of opinion really, I mean

05:08.000 --> 05:18.560
it's anybody that claims to have some special insight into this is lying. There does seem to be a

05:18.560 --> 05:26.960
connection between, I mean, philosophy seems to be particularly creative at sudden critical

05:26.960 --> 05:37.600
points in history, so we can think about, you know, the 13th century and the rise of scholasticism

05:37.600 --> 05:43.760
and that, which comes out of that, that confluence of thinking in the Arabic world,

05:44.720 --> 05:52.800
Greek thinking in the Arabic world, and then that finding its feet in Paris and Bologna and the

05:52.800 --> 05:58.240
beginnings of universities and that, or you could say the 17th century, the rise of the scientific

05:58.240 --> 06:09.280
view of things, which is also a period of intense conflicts, war, and we could, if we look at the

06:09.280 --> 06:19.200
20th century, there's no doubt that, I mean, the first and second world wars were not great,

06:20.160 --> 06:28.240
but they did provide stimulus for philosophical thinking, and which itself is quite interesting,

06:28.240 --> 06:37.120
first world war, you get Wittgenstein, Rosenzweig, Lukacs, Heidegger for sure, and the second world

06:37.120 --> 06:43.840
war really produces generations of philosophers that are really, you know, doing high-level

06:43.840 --> 06:52.000
interesting work. Where are we now? I don't know, I think there's a renewed interest in philosophy,

06:52.000 --> 06:58.480
and, you know, I've been trying to help that along in my little way over the years, but it's,

07:00.880 --> 07:07.520
and in many ways the, in a way, the internet has been kind to philosophy in the way that it's been

07:08.400 --> 07:14.240
unkind to the novel, which was the, you know, that was the cultural form that dominated the world

07:14.240 --> 07:22.160
that I grew up in, people read novels, now they watch Netflix series, and maybe they've got some

07:22.160 --> 07:30.720
space for short form, you know, short form blogs and articles and things like that, ideas which are

07:30.720 --> 07:39.120
more easily digested, so perhaps it's a, it's a good time for philosophy, but it's not a good time

07:39.120 --> 07:47.360
institutionally, and philosophy is, you know, there are two different views of philosophy, one view is

07:47.360 --> 07:53.680
that, you know, philosophy is just thinking, and it can take place anywhere, and philosophy should

07:53.680 --> 07:59.920
be in the streets, and that's fine, and that goes all the way back to the cynics, and, you know,

07:59.920 --> 08:07.200
thinking in public in ancient Greece, often without clothes on, masturbating and living in

08:07.200 --> 08:12.000
barrels and doing crazy things, another view is that philosophy is something which has always

08:12.000 --> 08:19.680
required an institutional framework, and that's, you know, that's what the academy was for Plato,

08:19.680 --> 08:25.600
the Lyceum for Aristotle, and so on and so forth, so the institutional framework for the last

08:26.240 --> 08:32.640
couple of hundred years has been the university, and is interesting philosophy coming out of

08:32.640 --> 08:38.400
universities at this point, I don't think so, I really don't, there's a lot of smart people, but

08:38.960 --> 08:46.240
not really much happening, so that would be one kind of half answer to that difficult question.
