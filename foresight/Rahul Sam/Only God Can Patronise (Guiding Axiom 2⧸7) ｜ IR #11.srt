00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the inner realm podcast. It's been a while. Yes,

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:13,440
indeed. I took a small break from podcasting and sort of focused a bit more on computer science and

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,840
software engineering type content, which I shall be uploading on the YouTube channel too. But I'm

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,000
happy and excited to get back on the podcast again. I have some great conversations lined up,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,240
but also on top of that, some of my own pieces that I'm putting together, I propose

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,680
Heidegger and phenomenology. So clearly, please give me a bit of time and a bit of grace because

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
obviously it's not easy stuff to comprehend, man. I'll tell you that. Heidegger is most certainly

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:55,360
dense and it's hard to really get him. However, today I'll be focusing on something I started

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,680
a couple of months ago, reading out these guiding axioms from my newsletter. So I've already laid

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,480
down seven axioms. I've been writing a bit on the background and I've been, I want to read all of

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,440
them out in this podcast because something I realized was, oh, these, these guiding axioms that

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,920
I'm laying down for the newsletter, the unhappy man newsletter, by the way, if I didn't already

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,040
mentioned that links down below in the description if you want to subscribe to it. And in any case,

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:30,960
these axioms are essentially a, an heralding framework for all of my, let's say creative work.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,160
Any content I produce on the podcast or anything that I write, I want to ensure that I do it within

16
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,920
the, I don't want to say bounce because that sounds restrictive, but at least these axioms will be

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,520
sort of a framework for me to work through. And it also helps lay down my thoughts as to

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,840
why the bloody hell do I do any of this in the first place? To be fair, I haven't got an answer

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:05,360
to that yet. Well, that's a whole other conversation, but today's guiding axiom number two is only

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,720
gold can patronize. And the previous axiom I covered was restrain the urge to overcome

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,120
unhappiness with ideological prescription. If you haven't listened to watch that episode already,

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,920
I'll leave a link to that in the description down below too. But today it's guiding axiom,

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:33,440
guiding axiom. I, for some reason, I, I keep saying guardians of the galaxy or like,

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:41,200
guardian axiom. It's odd. Guiding axiom number two is only gold can patronize.

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,320
So I've said here, the following is a second guiding axiom for this newsletter.

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,800
Yeah, happy man. It's one of the many that I hope to share in the upcoming weeks. I wrote this a

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,560
while back, so I've already shared these. As I'm writing these, it's dawn on me that these aren't

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,120
a mere helm solely for writing, but rather I seem to be setting up a framework for all of my creative

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,000
life itself. As I said before, so thank you. And yes, I mean that sincerely. Thank you for letting

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,840
me be self-indulgent in this manner. It is, I've always thought a lot of what I do is rather

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,040
self-indulgent, but I take no shame in the matter. There's nothing wrong with a bit of,

32
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,600
a bit of good nature, self-indulgence, self-indulgence or egoism, let's say.

33
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,680
Okay, let's get started. I feel a deep love for Jesus Christ. Does anyone that dares to call

34
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,480
himself Gordon Connard, it ought to be Christ? But he also exasperates me by saying things like this.

35
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,160
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children

36
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,600
or lands, for my namesake, shall receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life.

37
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:02,160
Matthew, 1929. I can only imagine the overweening goal at hubris one has to make such supercilious

38
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:09,520
proclamations. If anyone else made such demands of me, I tell them to go take a hike. And that's

39
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,840
me being polite to keep this newsletter decent. Pause. What I meant to really say there was,

40
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,560
I tell them to fuck off. I don't know why I was censoring myself there. Most contemporary

41
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,040
theologians tend to eschew Christianity and present a tepid, mellowed down version of it

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,120
for a more emasculated audience. But Jesus meant what he explicitly stated. And there's no getting

43
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,000
around it with hermeneutical trickery. In that sense, I'm a Christian not for its reasonableness,

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,600
but instead for its sheer radicalism and scandalous unreasonableness. Perhaps it's the

45
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,520
audacity for Jesus to casually patronize the masses that truly makes him Gordon Connard.

46
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,720
I doubt even the most egomaniacal narcissists think of themselves as humanity's savior.

47
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,560
I'm not anyone's savior. Hang out for that. The burden of such a responsibility would be

48
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,920
too unbearable. I'm happy to leave that with Christ. Therefore, I will not patronize and

49
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,720
talk down to anyone. Presumably, only the Son of God can do that. So, I won't molecule the reader

50
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,720
with superfluous, so I won't molecule the reader or listener in this case, with superfluous caveats

51
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,520
and footnotes. If what I write isn't clear, then it's either my fault for being an inept writer

52
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,880
and I need to improve my craft or you need to educate yourself and learn to wrestle with a

53
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,680
given piece to extract its meaning. I suspect that the former will be the case most of the time.

54
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,000
Besides, reading should not be treated as a leisurely activity one engages into past one's time.

55
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,240
I point that the commitment towards lucidity lies within both parties. If we repudiate

56
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,560
this responsibility without inability to struggle with the peace of creation anymore,

57
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,560
artistic, philosophical or otherwise, we're forever trapped in the banality of modern life.

58
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,720
Perhaps, it's similar to what David Foster Wallace observed about popular

59
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,480
entertainment, which has capitulated to a lust for immediacy and constant sensuousness.

60
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:37,040
Christly put, for us post-industrial modernists, art has no qualitative value over yet another

61
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,120
commercial action flick, fast food or pornography. Is this the post-modern curse?

62
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:51,440
So, modern art has to be dumbed down to attract the masses. Nothing is more patronizing and

63
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,440
insulting to the human spirit than this. It's not egalitarianism, but a peculiar form of

64
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,400
aristocratic bigotry. For Wallace, the arts, especially literature, can bring unspeakable

65
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,880
depth and meaning to our lives, but it requires toil. It should never be treated as a distraction

66
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,680
but rather as something that accentuates and reveals all of life itself. For instance, I thought

67
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,680
eminent artists and philosophers intentionally obfuscated their work for pretentiousness and

68
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,320
elitism. Well, there certainly are cases where this is true. Vanity takes many forms. The more

69
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:37,200
I've labored at reading and immersing myself in art and philosophy, I've concluded that it's mostly

70
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:45,440
my ignorance and complacency. It rarely was the piece of work, but my indolent unwillingness to

71
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,520
persevere through. In that spirit, I will not treat any of my readers or listeners as lost sheep in

72
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,000
need of a good, sagacious shepherd. Besides, apart from the reasons mentioned above, it's also because

73
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,320
I must admit, in all candor, I'm starting this newsletter or podcast primarily for a selfish

74
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,960
reason. It's a forum for me about everyone else to seek truth, if such a thing exists and it's

75
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,480
even knowable to us. Then you may ask why I share my writings publicly. Partially, it's for criticism

76
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:24,320
and feedback so that I can update my perspectives, a contrived form of collective cognition and

77
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:32,480
decision making, so to speak. It may be pomp and vanity too, but predominantly because I profoundly

78
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:40,080
resonate with an adage, apocryphally attributed to Carl R. Rogers, Carl Rogers, the American

79
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,280
humanist psychologist. What is most personal is most universal. I think the essence of this

80
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,240
sentiment, it caused that unforgettable line from Schindler's List taken from the Talmud,

81
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:01,040
he who saves one life, saves the world entire. Of course, I'm not at least consciously

82
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,920
in the world saving business, but it rings true that the individual struggle is the human struggle.

83
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,440
The individual questions are instantiations of the seeking human heart. For one to suffer is for

84
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,240
many to suffer and to love another is to love humanity and entire. Perhaps, God has no other

85
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,440
option than to create us in his own image, so that as that's what being human ontologically means,

86
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,480
where a locus of divine paradoxes, or as Justice F.C. wrote, the awful thing is that beauty is

87
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,720
mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are fighting there and the battlefield

88
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,880
is the heart of man. If he weren't created in his image, then he wouldn't be human beings,

89
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,640
but some other thing. Such claims can never be proven intellectually, but only be made

90
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:02,960
realize to run through life alone. You may never entirely comprehend what it feels like

91
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,960
when I say I'm in pain or agony, nor can you ever take my place and feel it for me,

92
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,840
but you still know what I mean when I say I'm hurting. While we undoubtedly have our subjective

93
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:22,640
individual experience that can never be generalized, represented as a mere categorical abstraction,

94
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,360
that to my great annoyance, modern psychology tends to do, we also have a trans-subjective

95
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,320
common human experience. And writing with the exception of music, I find, is the most beautiful

96
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,040
way of tapping into our shared realm, such as why I believe only God can patronize,

97
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,440
and I will never patronize ever in this podcast. At least, that is what I'm striving to do. Thanks

98
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
for watching.
