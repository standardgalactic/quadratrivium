0	1880	All right, this is an excellent segue, Leon.
1880	4840	But the problem is, unfortunately, we're short for time.
4840	7160	So forgive me for rushing you with this.
7160	12320	But I think in the forward and in the introduction itself,
12320	16360	you basically claim, of course, as you highlighted,
16360	20880	the subjective structures that Freud and Lacan
20880	24920	identified with neurosis, perversion, and psychosis.
24920	29360	And then in the book, you posit that autism,
29400	34240	you say is not a pathology, but a mode of being.
34240	37440	So again, I know we're short of short for time,
37440	42640	but if you could sort of maybe give us a prelude,
42640	44840	because obviously to get an understanding of that,
44840	49840	you got to read the book, but a very elementary prelude
49840	53680	as to what you mean by firstly, a mode of being,
53680	59160	and then why you claim that autism is another mode of being
59160	61880	on top of the ones identified by Freud and Lacan.
65160	70680	So first, let me say, Rahul, that I don't know.
70680	74040	You can see if your listeners are interested in our talk
74040	78080	or you yourself, and we can schedule another meeting
78080	79440	if you want to continue.
79440	80480	I'd be very grateful.
80480	81480	Yes.
81480	85080	I want to ask you about foreclosure.
85080	87000	And particularly, may you highlight
87000	89840	the difference between a psychotic flakosha
89840	91120	and autistic flakosha?
91120	93200	And I don't think we'll have time today for that.
93200	95400	So maybe this could be just an introduction.
95400	98640	And I'd be very grateful if we could reschedule another talk,
98640	100800	another conversation.
100800	101520	Sure, sure.
101520	104280	So that's, I put this on the table,
104280	108360	so we won't be too stressed for a time, OK?
108360	110560	Thank you.
110600	117440	So yeah, I give this idea of a mode of being,
117440	121240	borrowing this from the phenomenologists, of course,
121240	122880	this kind of term.
122880	125360	But I use it a bit differently in the book.
125360	133120	And this is the idea that one's particular use of language
133120	137840	in order to compensate for the inherent schism
137880	143800	between the inner world and the humanized world
143800	145720	is, for me, a mode of being.
145720	147760	It is a mode of existence.
147760	150360	Because we find our existence in language,
150360	153920	as you were saying and you were quoting from the book.
153920	158040	One is does not only find their meaning,
158040	163840	let's say, in this kind of Satrian way,
163840	168320	existence prior to meaning that you are born
168320	175160	and then you find who you are or whatever your goals or aims
175160	177160	are at your life.
177160	180400	We see with you is this expert that you brought,
180400	184560	is that one is born already endowed with meaning,
184560	188000	already determined by language.
188000	190440	And we say it's a name.
190440	193520	It's these projections that the parents might have on a baby,
193520	195840	even before it is born.
195840	200800	Today, we have the sonogram and these images of the baby
200800	201760	and the womb.
201760	204120	People already start having their fantasies
204120	207880	about even their face structure.
207880	210400	We know if they're a boy or a girl,
210400	214880	one has already meanings that are stuck to them
214880	215760	before they're born.
216600	225840	And so we say one becomes human, one subjectifies,
225840	231360	one is situated in the humanized world
231360	234640	through their use of language, through their relationship
234640	237920	with this language that is alien, that is outside of them,
237920	242480	that exists prior and will exist after.
242480	244320	Now, this particular use of language
244320	247280	is a mode of existence because it situates us
247280	251600	in the world, in the social world, in our body,
251600	255080	in relationship with other people in the world,
255080	258040	in relationship with our own ego.
258040	265120	So language is the mode through which one becomes.
265120	270000	And then neurosis is one of these modes.
270000	273560	And I argue that psychosis and perversion
273560	276080	are also these modes.
276080	279560	But my point is, and this is where
279560	283240	I think maybe this mode of being steps away
283240	287920	from the Heideggerian design, this mode of being
287920	294000	that Heidegger speaks about, is that I'll be a little blunt.
294000	300960	For me, everyone is developmentally disordered.
300960	304000	They say that autism is a developmental disorder.
304000	306920	This is how it's determined.
306920	310360	If you follow Freud, everyone is necessarily
310360	312960	developmentally disordered.
312960	316240	Freud speaks about the fixation of the drives.
316240	320000	So the drives are these things that determine our pleasure
320000	320760	and suffering.
320760	323120	And he says that at a certain point in one's life,
323120	326200	they're fixated, and they stop developing,
326200	327880	uses these words.
327880	330120	They are stopped in the middle of their development.
330120	333160	And then they continue in the same way,
333160	334560	which is not the proper way.
334560	337600	It is just a way that keeps on functioning.
337600	341320	So everyone is, in a sense, developmentally disordered.
341320	346120	We are born split with this inherent schism that
346120	347960	is unmendable.
347960	350680	We use language to compensate for it.
350680	356880	And as we do something in the development of the drives,
356880	360680	of these things that move us, that color the world,
360680	364840	that make the world, basically, objects
364840	368680	exist in the world when they are invested with libido.
368680	370880	They don't exist when they are not invested.
370880	374960	So basically, this means that the world stops developing,
374960	376560	in this sense.
376560	380080	So everyone, the neurotic, the psychotic, the perverse,
380120	383600	and the autistic are all developmentally disordered.
383600	386320	And this is why each of these perspectives
386320	388440	are, let's say, a mode of being.
388440	391360	They're an attitude in relation to reality.
391360	396080	They're a way to do with language.
396080	398880	When I say then that they are distinct,
398880	404280	then I don't make here some kind of an ontological argument.
404280	406720	And this is something that's important to clarify.
406720	409800	I don't mean that here's Woody Allen.
409800	411560	He's neurotic.
411560	414680	Here's Daniel Schreber for its case.
414680	416200	He's psychotic.
416200	420040	And here's, I don't know, Temple Grandin.
420040	422360	She's autistic.
422360	429400	I mean that there are different ways to do with language.
429400	440280	And these necessitate our attention as analysts.
440280	444520	And it means that working with this particular subject that
444520	447800	has this particular way of doing with language
447800	451400	will dictate situating myself in the transference
451400	455200	in such and such a way, and making such and such
455200	456440	interventions.
456440	460600	And with the psychotic subject, that will not be the case.
460600	464160	Because if I will position myself in the same way,
464160	466160	that could be catastrophic.
466160	470040	For instance, this is something, again,
470040	472640	it's not a real example, it's just to clarify my point.
472640	477400	So with neurotic, it's important not to answer one's
477400	479440	demands for love many times.
479440	484040	And this also means that you sometimes go on vacation
484040	487920	and you don't really say, look, I'm sorry,
487920	491160	but I have to go and continue.
491160	492200	You say, I'm going.
492200	494280	We see each other in two weeks.
494280	495480	Let's set a date.
495480	497360	Good.
497360	500480	With the psychotic subject, you will not do that.
500480	503640	Because there is a risk for, let's say,
503640	506720	a paranoid thoughts.
506720	508160	Where is he going?
508160	509360	Is he staying home?
509360	510280	Will he be here?
510280	511760	Is he seeing other people?
511800	515280	Is he actually going to follow me and not tell me?
515280	517640	So with the psychotic, I would say, I'm going for two weeks.
517640	518400	I will be here.
518400	519200	This is my email.
519200	520400	You can contact me.
520400	522400	I'll be available between these and these hours.
522400	526120	I'll come back on Tuesday and we meet immediately on Wednesday.
526120	527720	And you can write to me if there's a problem
527720	530920	and we can reschedule, et cetera.
530920	533600	So you see that there's a different way
533600	536840	one engages with even the logistical level
536840	539440	of handling an analysis.
539480	542320	So this manifests itself on all the other levels.
542320	545400	So what I'm saying, when I'm saying that autism
545400	548840	is a distinct mode of being, is I'm
548840	553800	saying that one needs to handle an analysis under the hypothesis
553800	557160	of autism in a way that is different than the one
557160	564000	that we would do when there is a hypothesis of psychosis,
564000	565760	perversion, and neurosis.
