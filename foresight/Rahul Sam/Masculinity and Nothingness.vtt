00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Hey everyone, welcome to this reading of my essay, Masculinity and Nothingness.

00:05.680 --> 00:10.480
So since the topic of masculinity has been on the news with the rise of controversial

00:10.480 --> 00:17.520
figures like Andrew Tay, I decided to write this essay on masculinity from an existentialist

00:17.520 --> 00:24.000
perspective, particularly inspired by the work of John Posatra and Martin Heidegger.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.200
So without further ado, let's get started, Masculinity and Nothingness.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.320
Do you become a man instead of being born one?

00:31.320 --> 00:37.120
Because we have, for millennia, made moral, aesthetic, religious demands on the world,

00:37.120 --> 00:42.880
looked upon it with blind desire, passion or fear, and abandoned ourselves to the bad

00:42.880 --> 00:45.280
habits of illogical thinking.

00:45.280 --> 00:52.440
This world has gradually become so marvelously variegated, frightful, meaningful, soulful.

00:52.440 --> 00:59.800
It is a quiet color, but we have been the colorists, favorite nature, human or too human.

00:59.800 --> 01:05.400
You are condemned to be a man, not because we live amidst a so-called masculinity crisis

01:05.400 --> 01:09.040
where young men are purposeless and lost.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.880
These are secondary concerns.

01:11.880 --> 01:17.440
Instead it's because you're thrown into this world with circumstances you never chose.

01:17.440 --> 01:23.840
You're born into a specific time, family, culture, gender and body that you never asked

01:23.840 --> 01:24.840
for.

01:24.840 --> 01:31.080
You have no idea why you are here, but still expected to follow arbitrary customs, social

01:31.080 --> 01:36.120
conventions, with ties of kinship, duty and so on.

01:36.120 --> 01:42.200
As the song Riders on the Storm goes, into this world we are thrown like a dog without

01:42.200 --> 01:44.520
a bone.

01:44.520 --> 01:49.720
If you momentarily pause and think of the uncanny nature of existence and your position

01:49.720 --> 01:56.480
in an ostensibly meaningless universe where you nevertheless seek meaning, you discover

01:56.480 --> 01:59.640
life is downright absurd.

01:59.640 --> 02:06.160
Accordingly grasping this absurdity is a starting point to realizing that masculinity, as defined

02:06.160 --> 02:09.400
by society, does not exist.

02:09.400 --> 02:17.440
Therefore what Simone de Beauvoir said about women also applies to men albeit differently.

02:17.440 --> 02:22.240
One is not born but rather becomes a woman, a second sex.

02:22.240 --> 02:28.520
Respective of your biological sex, what you think of as a real man that is how you should

02:28.520 --> 02:35.760
conduct yourself both socially and privately is a sociohistorical construct where you become

02:35.760 --> 02:38.920
a man instead of being born one.

02:38.920 --> 02:44.480
Since man lacks any masculine essence, you are free.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.600
And man's freedom amongst his throneness is the actual crisis.

02:49.600 --> 02:56.640
To understand throneness, a concept introduced by Martin Heidegger as Guofenheim, lets exemplify

02:56.640 --> 03:01.600
using the body which inescapably constitutes one's being.

03:01.600 --> 03:07.000
As Jean-Paul Sartre argued, you are a transcendent consciousness that allows you to transcend

03:07.000 --> 03:13.880
a subjective body and experience freedom, a tearing away from oneself, a rashmaswa.

03:13.880 --> 03:19.200
So perhaps you've had the bizarre experience one goes through in life, apropos one's body.

03:19.200 --> 03:24.920
You may stand naked in front of a mirror and see that you, whatever you or I mean, Heidegger

03:24.920 --> 03:29.360
calls it a Dasein, Dasein, their being.

03:29.360 --> 03:35.120
Dasein's being is always at issue for it and its very being as having to take a stand

03:35.120 --> 03:39.920
upon that issue by living its life in one way or another.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.480
The Cambridge Heidegger lexicon.

03:43.480 --> 03:51.000
Have a body that seems alien, which you may not even like and yet you as a self cannot

03:51.000 --> 03:53.840
be in this world without it.

03:53.840 --> 03:59.080
In fact, it's impossible to imagine what it's like to live without a body.

03:59.080 --> 04:05.600
For a moment, leave aside the vain attributes, e.g. fatness, scrawniness, stretch marks,

04:05.600 --> 04:12.160
pimples, etc. and look at your body phenomenologically as part of things themselves, meaning back

04:12.160 --> 04:17.160
to the ways that things of the world are actually given an experience.

04:17.160 --> 04:23.480
Then you realize, as elucidated by Maurice Molopointe, the body is something that's

04:23.480 --> 04:25.920
a factical part of you.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.840
It's endowed to you automatically as a brute fact of your existence.

04:30.840 --> 04:37.040
Although at first glance your body looks like any other object in the world, if you keep

04:37.040 --> 04:43.480
staring at that mirror, you'll realize this body of yours isn't merely a set of properties

04:43.480 --> 04:48.200
and mechanisms, rather it's what allows you to exist.

04:48.200 --> 04:53.080
In fact, when you act in the world by going for a walk, let's say, and duck a protruding

04:53.200 --> 04:59.240
tree branch, you never experience the body as a thing utilized to duck that branch.

04:59.240 --> 05:04.160
Instead, as you're engaged in the act, the body disappears, and your intentionality,

05:04.160 --> 05:08.440
not to let that branch touch you, constitutes your experience.

05:08.440 --> 05:14.400
Paradoxically, the disappearance of the body is what allows your intent to actualize.

05:14.400 --> 05:20.240
The body also allows you to make sense of the world and how the broader ecological context

05:20.240 --> 05:22.480
you're immersed within is structured.

05:22.520 --> 05:27.720
Like in our example, that of an unpredictable environment where tree branches are jutting

05:27.720 --> 05:29.360
out.

05:29.360 --> 05:34.440
One ought to realize that the body isn't a mere vessel to carry our conscious experience

05:34.440 --> 05:39.160
around the world, but rather it's a part of us innately.

05:39.160 --> 05:45.680
Of course, such a prosaic experience doesn't necessarily lead to the aforementioned incongruity

05:45.680 --> 05:51.800
of the body-feeling alien, as your body seems to be doing what it's supposed to do by following

05:51.800 --> 05:53.440
your commands, so to speak.

05:53.440 --> 05:58.960
Nonetheless, it's indicative of how you're thrown into your body, and that it isn't something

05:58.960 --> 06:05.200
you can dispose of by uploading your consciousness to a computer or some such nonsense.

06:05.200 --> 06:10.960
However, something saliently particular to the body you'll see on that mirror is your

06:10.960 --> 06:18.560
penis, the phallic, fleshy, hairy bulge between your legs that St. Augustine says God gave

06:18.560 --> 06:24.560
us as punishment for original sin, because as most men know, it doesn't work when you

06:24.560 --> 06:30.000
want it to, think of a one-night stand, and works when you don't want it to, think of

06:30.000 --> 06:32.960
a random erection in public.

06:32.960 --> 06:38.360
Your penis is the quintessential indicator of the bizarreness of life, as it shows the

06:38.360 --> 06:44.680
antagonism between your freedom as a conscious and transcendent human being, while also having

06:44.680 --> 06:54.040
your existence physically embodied with biological drives such as an unfitted libido, in our case.

06:54.040 --> 06:59.960
When wanting to duck that branch, your body follows your intentionality, but rarely does

06:59.960 --> 07:04.440
a man control his sexual drives, or lack thereof.

07:04.440 --> 07:10.880
As Haruki Murakami writes, the penis is a strange organ that has a mind of its own and

07:10.880 --> 07:17.000
thinks thoughts not shared by my brain, Kafka on the show, and Augustine knows this best

07:17.000 --> 07:21.600
because he really couldn't keep it in his pants back in the 4th century.

07:21.600 --> 07:28.640
So your penis is illustrative of the real masculinity crisis, because it shows the paradox of existence.

07:28.640 --> 07:34.880
Considering that, unlike objects, e.g. trees, chairs, iPhones, etc., that are being in the

07:34.880 --> 07:42.440
world, onsua, a mode of existence that is static, unconscious, and simply is, you are

07:42.440 --> 07:49.360
infinite freedom, a being for itself, posua, that is a conscious being aware of their own

07:49.360 --> 07:54.840
consciousness, but is also incomplete, ambiguous, and non-determined.

07:54.840 --> 08:01.280
This lacking of a predetermined essence forces man to create himself out of nothingness,

08:01.280 --> 08:06.760
and man is nothing when the nothingness is primarily realized to us through negation,

08:06.760 --> 08:11.480
that is, when a person's absence is accurately apprehended.

08:11.480 --> 08:17.720
The most vivid example he, Sartre, provides to illustrate this pre-reflective negation

08:17.720 --> 08:21.160
as the apprehension of Peir's absence from a café.

08:21.160 --> 08:25.640
Sartre describes Peir's absence as pervading the whole café.

08:25.640 --> 08:30.920
The café is cast in the metaphorical shade of Peir, not being there at the time he had

08:30.920 --> 08:32.560
been expected.

08:32.560 --> 08:36.680
This experience depends on human expectations, of course.

08:36.680 --> 08:42.720
Sartre argues that if, by contrast, we imagine or reflect that someone else is not present,

08:42.720 --> 08:49.920
say the Duke of Wellington, an elephant, etc., these abstract negative facts are not existentially

08:49.920 --> 08:54.840
given in the same manner as our pre-reflective encounter with Peir's absence.

08:54.840 --> 08:59.800
They're not given as an objective fact, as a component of the real.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.960
Inomenologically speaking, the nothingness of Peir is a reality.

09:03.960 --> 09:10.040
In your experience, his palpable lack is salient about everything else, in this hypothetical

09:10.040 --> 09:11.040
café.

09:11.040 --> 09:15.800
Therefore, it gives non-being an ontological place.

09:15.800 --> 09:21.160
Everything that's already at being in the café, from the other patrons, baristas, waiters,

09:21.160 --> 09:29.120
the furniture, etc., ceases to exist and your attention goes solely to the absence of Peir.

09:29.120 --> 09:34.880
This pre-reflective negative apprehension penetrates you, but you don't directly intend

09:34.880 --> 09:41.680
not to see Peir, but rather you dramatically encounter the non-being of Peir, or as Sartre

09:41.680 --> 09:46.920
writes, Peir absent haunts this café, being a nothingness.

09:46.920 --> 09:53.200
In that sense, the fact of your pre-reflective negation, apropos Peir, also applies to you

09:53.200 --> 09:58.160
because let's say if Peir showed up and you were absent, then he would encounter your

09:58.160 --> 10:01.920
non-being because you're a Dazain, much like him.

10:01.920 --> 10:08.520
So what makes your being stand out is not any grounded positive affirmation, i.e. reputation,

10:08.520 --> 10:13.200
personality, psychological type, and so on, but everything you're not.

10:13.200 --> 10:18.920
The ambiguity of your existence, you are what you are, and you're not what you are, is the

10:18.920 --> 10:20.920
Sartre and nothingness.

10:20.920 --> 10:26.680
It imbues the tension between your being in itself and being for itself.

10:26.680 --> 10:33.320
That is between you being a biological, psychological, and socio-historical creature, and your self-perception

10:33.320 --> 10:41.800
as negating those observable or descriptive properties of your being in support of an aspirational

10:41.800 --> 10:47.480
or ideal view of yourself that's learning, growing, philosophizing, etc.

10:47.480 --> 10:54.240
In that vein, your starting point to being you is by declaring I am not that thing, which

10:54.240 --> 11:00.680
perhaps is why your starting point to being a man is by declaring I reject masculinity.

11:00.680 --> 11:05.120
For that reason, your nothingness condemns you to be free, because if you're nothing,

11:05.120 --> 11:11.040
you only exist in this world qua infinite possibilities, presenting themselves to you.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.800
Similar to standing on the edge of a cliff and knowing very well you have the freedom

11:14.800 --> 11:20.720
to jump, nonetheless, you must choose from these possibilities every conscious moment

11:20.720 --> 11:21.920
of your life.

11:22.160 --> 11:26.640
Therefore, you're constantly recreating yourself through action by projecting yourself

11:26.640 --> 11:30.800
onto the world, which is a task that leaves one perturbed.

11:30.800 --> 11:36.880
Fegregarde describes as angst as the dizziness of freedom.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.760
Your masculinity has no essential reality.

11:39.760 --> 11:46.040
It doesn't objectively exist, and the existence of a man precedes the essence of his masculinity.

11:46.040 --> 11:52.280
That said, your body, particularly the penis, is still a reminder that while you're completely

11:52.280 --> 11:58.440
aware of your freedom, you nonetheless throne into a life of finitude that constrains this

11:58.440 --> 12:00.600
freedom of your consciousness.

12:00.600 --> 12:05.440
Though you're not trapped in it, thinking so is a piezolanumist response to life.

12:05.440 --> 12:10.800
As Portillic writes, man is essentially finite freedom.

12:10.800 --> 12:15.400
Freedom not in the sense of indeterminacy, but in the sense of being able to determine

12:15.400 --> 12:19.560
himself through decision in the center of his being.

12:19.560 --> 12:26.600
Man as finite freedom is free within the contingencies of his finitude, the courage to be.

12:26.600 --> 12:31.320
The contradiction between freedom and throneness is irreconcilable.

12:31.320 --> 12:37.240
Nor is it a mere duality one can be indifferent towards, but a fact of life to struggle with,

12:37.240 --> 12:38.680
violently.

12:38.680 --> 12:46.240
No synthesis between these conflicting truths lead to sublimated wholeness, or some higher

12:46.240 --> 12:47.960
comforting truth.

12:47.960 --> 12:54.680
Instead, the truth lies in the sheer antagonism itself, and it's this violent friction that

12:54.680 --> 13:02.800
leads to what Gabriel Marcel calls the homoverto, the traveler, where man is never a destination,

13:02.800 --> 13:07.360
but he is an unresolved contradictory and itenderant being.

13:07.360 --> 13:13.320
We can never own anything, and we never truly settle anywhere, even if we stay in one place

13:13.320 --> 13:17.840
all our lives, at the existentialist café.

13:17.840 --> 13:23.400
Being thrown into the aforementioned paradox puts us in the unknown, and sometimes even

13:23.400 --> 13:24.400
the uncanny.

13:24.400 --> 13:29.760
Or specifically, for Marcel it leads to the mystery of existence.

13:29.760 --> 13:35.880
One will never make sense of this mystery, yet it ought to be faced valiantly.

13:35.880 --> 13:41.040
It isn't a mere speculative problem that's solvable a-personally at a distance, but it

13:41.040 --> 13:46.640
becomes a mystery only because, above all, we are involved in the mystery as it's particular

13:46.640 --> 13:52.880
to us and cannot be tackled by anybody at all, but rather it reveals itself for nobody

13:52.880 --> 13:56.160
but me.

13:56.160 --> 14:02.120
Facing everything delineated above requires courage, which a man should aspire to embody.

14:02.120 --> 14:07.840
Paul Tillich writes on courage pertaining to anxiety stating, courage does not remove

14:07.840 --> 14:09.240
anxiety.

14:09.240 --> 14:12.880
Since anxiety is existential, it cannot be removed.

14:12.880 --> 14:17.160
But courage takes the anxiety of non-being into itself.

14:17.160 --> 14:24.160
Courage is self-affirmation, in spite of, namely, in spite of non-being.

14:24.160 --> 14:31.480
He who acts courageously takes in his self-affirmation the anxiety of non-being upon himself, the

14:31.480 --> 14:34.400
courage to be.

14:34.400 --> 14:40.400
Similarly, your courage shouldn't remove the paradox and mystery of existence, but

14:40.400 --> 14:47.320
take an opponent yourself assumed fully, and then you act in spite of and through it with

14:47.320 --> 14:53.840
the awareness that only you can affirm yourself, only you can act in this particular instance.

14:53.840 --> 15:00.360
Therefore, to do away with preconceived notions of masculinity is this supreme act of courage

15:00.360 --> 15:01.600
for a man.

15:01.600 --> 15:07.200
If you haven't experienced any of this phenomena illuminated above, you're distracting yourself

15:07.200 --> 15:08.600
and being a coward.

15:08.600 --> 15:13.480
If you're listening to misogynists like Andrew Tate, so-called men's podcasts like Fresh

15:13.480 --> 15:20.680
and Fit, or even more positive figures like Jordan Peterson, you have no existential vitality,

15:20.680 --> 15:24.680
no awareness of life, and your will to live is weakened.

15:25.160 --> 15:30.680
Thereby, you refuse to take responsibility to face reality and have outsourced your living

15:30.680 --> 15:32.680
to the other.

15:32.680 --> 15:37.960
You have become a sheep refusing to think critically, you are a slave that needs a master

15:37.960 --> 15:40.280
commanding you how to live.

15:40.280 --> 15:47.680
Sathra calls such instances bad faith, mv svoa, denying our inherent freedom.

15:47.680 --> 15:53.520
We know we're radically free, but we repudiate the responsibility of their freedom by conforming

15:53.520 --> 15:54.840
to the other.

15:54.840 --> 16:01.080
In our case, that's masculinity, or what a real man should be, similar to how a Parisian

16:01.080 --> 16:03.600
waiter plays a performative role.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.800
Let us consider this waiter in the café.

16:06.800 --> 16:11.520
His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid.

16:11.520 --> 16:14.880
He comes towards the patrons with a step, a little too quick.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.360
He bends forward a little too eagerly.

16:17.360 --> 16:22.680
His voice, his eyes express an interest, a little too solicitous for the order of the

16:22.680 --> 16:23.840
customer.

16:23.840 --> 16:27.400
All his behavior seems to us a gain.

16:27.400 --> 16:33.200
He applies himself to training his movements as if they were mechanisms, the one regulating

16:33.200 --> 16:34.200
the other.

16:34.200 --> 16:38.280
His gestures and even his voice seem to be mechanisms.

16:38.280 --> 16:42.600
He gives himself the quickness and pettiless rapidity of things.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.720
He is plain.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.560
He is amusing himself.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.760
But what is he playing?

16:47.760 --> 16:51.440
We need not watch long before we can explain it.

16:51.440 --> 16:55.000
He is playing at being a waiter in a café.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.160
There are indeed many precautions to impress a man in what he is, as if we lived in perpetual

17:02.160 --> 17:09.760
fear, that he might escape from it, that he might break away and suddenly elude his condition,

17:09.760 --> 17:11.760
being a nothingness.

17:11.760 --> 17:16.320
This is no different to the performative role a businessman trying to sell you financial

17:16.320 --> 17:18.160
freedom plays.

17:18.160 --> 17:24.560
He speaks and dresses a certain way and asks questions not to understand or engage in dialogue,

17:24.560 --> 17:30.360
but to sustain his performance of being a competent and astute person.

17:30.360 --> 17:35.000
Much like the waiter, every action by the businessman is contrived.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.640
He follows a prefabricated narrative given to him by society.

17:39.640 --> 17:44.080
He is an actor following a script, performing for the public.

17:44.080 --> 17:49.160
Of course, being a man is also a performance you put on.

17:49.160 --> 17:54.120
That said, bad faith isn't about lies, self-deception or inauthenticity.

17:54.120 --> 17:57.800
As intimated in this essay, you don't have an authentic self.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.600
So there's no use trying to be your true self.

18:00.600 --> 18:04.520
And concomitantly, you cannot deceive a self that doesn't exist.

18:04.520 --> 18:11.640
Satra also doesn't believe one can escape bad faith entirely, because it's omnipresent.

18:11.640 --> 18:17.920
And we all inescapably play a role, as Shakespeare writes, all the worlds a stage, and all men

18:17.920 --> 18:22.320
and women merely players, as you like it.

18:22.320 --> 18:28.000
Does this mean you're in a hopeless situation where you'll always be a puppet of society?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Yes.

18:29.280 --> 18:35.320
And given you're free, in typical Camusian fashion, you can still choose to embrace the

18:35.320 --> 18:41.080
absurdity of your existence and find courage in hopelessness.

18:41.080 --> 18:46.360
While you will succumb to bad faith, you can fight your cowardly demise for eternity.

18:46.360 --> 18:52.560
You can orient yourself towards courage, taking radical responsibility and refusing to take

18:52.560 --> 18:55.640
comfort in false masculinity.

18:55.640 --> 19:02.960
You can create your subjective ideal of what being a man entails that solely appeases you

19:02.960 --> 19:03.960
alone.

19:03.960 --> 19:10.760
Indeed, it's unsurprising that Satra ends his magnum opus by writing, Man is a useless

19:10.760 --> 19:13.840
passion, being a nothingness.

19:13.840 --> 19:20.320
But perhaps his life showed that he tried to make himself worthy of his condition, and

19:20.320 --> 19:21.320
so should you.

19:21.640 --> 19:26.680
But on your own account, after all, Satra is just another dead philosopher.

19:26.680 --> 19:32.080
Whatever the case may be, this is the reality you're born into, so do with it as you may.

19:32.080 --> 19:37.120
Frankly, I choose courage, because all the ideals expounded by the phenomenologists and

19:37.120 --> 19:43.160
existentialists I tackled in this essay make life the ultimate adventure worth living for,

19:43.160 --> 19:45.680
if one doesn't shy away from them.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.360
Coda.

19:48.360 --> 19:52.760
The themes of exploding this essay certainly aren't specific to men.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.680
If you're human, they apply to you, bar none.

19:55.680 --> 20:01.560
However, I've intentionally used a language that'll direct this essay towards men, who

20:01.560 --> 20:07.200
are told they're in a crisis in the current socio-cultural and historical position.

20:07.200 --> 20:12.720
Therefore, this crisis ought to be aptly named the human crisis instead of the masculine

20:12.720 --> 20:18.880
adjective, although that would generalize the situation all too much, making it an abstract

20:18.880 --> 20:22.000
theory which the existentialists would detest.

20:22.000 --> 20:29.400
In any case, replacing the terms man and masculine with woman and feminine, respectively, wouldn't

20:29.400 --> 20:31.880
change the underlying message of this piece.
