0	7880	Paul to put it very generally is a youtuber and commentator. However to get a bit of a let's say comprehensive
8400	13680	Bio I'm just gonna read out his YouTube channel bio as an introduction to this episode
14360	18440	It starts off by saying make centrism greater gain
19000	25600	So you I guess you need a not a mega but like a mega. Yeah, I want to make it like the centrism great again
25600	28880	So mech. Oh, sorry make enlightened centrism
29600	35360	Would be the mecha one if they give me a vol that I can make a slogan out of that could be now make centers and great again
35360	39120	We'll be good for now. That could be a much idea. Um, yeah
39120	40760	And then you state on this channel
40760	45720	I upload videos that can more or less be described as cultural than political analysis
46280	53960	Just as importantly I talk about my experiences as a person and how they inform my beliefs and most importantly my actions
54480	59720	Pause just a comment there. That's something I I love about your channel. I think you
61240	63480	You always connect let's say
64440	69720	So-called abstract theory into your own personal life. I think that's quite important, especially
70560	74200	Given that we have embodied physical beings and we aren't just ideas
75120	79600	So I just want to put that out there. I really appreciate that you do that even in the wash debate
79640	84520	You didn't talk about your experience with Jordan Peterson, which I'm hoping we could discuss today
85160	88880	Anyway, I'll continue. I believe the best way to resist
89560	94000	ideological extremism is by offering a better path forward through
95320	96360	multidisciplinary
96360	100680	Majoritarianism making to kind of flesh out what that term means
101520	108640	This is a multifaceted attempt to reaffirm the beliefs that I think the southern majority of people still hold
109600	114360	A desire for unity individualism and common-sense reforms of my decaying
115040	118320	cultural and political institutions. I reached out to Paul
119840	123160	Asking if he'd want to do a follow-up episode after his debate with the wash
123680	125200	and
125200	130840	The floor is yours Paul. Just yeah, well you missed it. You missed the last line of my YouTube bio
132440	136800	The last line looking let me there's a line that you miss at the end I copy it across
137520	140840	Oh, is this the part about you being a comedian for
141960	146360	For legal purposes everything I do is comedy. I certainly have read that out
147200	151120	For legal purposes, this is a comedy channel. Oh, that's right
151120	154680	Or should I say for legal purposes? Paul is a comedian. Exactly
156360	163760	It's just jokes. Yes to any people who may be offended or current or future employees everything I do is comedy
164240	165760	Yeah, cuz you know
165760	170740	You now use your real name, isn't it the last time we spoke you went by pf young
170740	174800	I didn't even call you Paul. I was just calling you pf young. I think oh, yeah
174800	179960	I think early early when I first uploaded the videos. I just use my real name
179960	186080	I mean, I'm Paul on I've said my last name before I just I just generally don't say it to add one more step in case
186080	187400	anyone wants to
187400	189900	Docs me and send dead animals to my family
190260	192300	but
192300	195220	No, I made it conscious decision
195220	199620	I didn't want to pf young is a channel name and people can call me pf young
199620	202420	but I you know, I always introduce myself as Paul and it's actually interesting because
204780	209180	Usually I do
211860	214860	This Paul P
215580	217580	If
219180	221500	There that's how I usually have my
222540	226500	Message oh in zoom. No, I changed it my little name at the bottom
227660	229660	parentheses also known as
230620	236820	To your point about like I talk about my experiences. I am a real person here and I don't like
237500	242780	The idea of like I'm you know, I'm pf young and I'm some sort of character that I'm not yeah
243020	245620	Yeah, not behind the camera, right and
246900	249220	So, yeah, so that's there's a there's a conscious element of that
249220	255540	I would I would I would just go by my full name if I you know, wasn't worried about crazy people constantly trying to
256220	259700	ruin everyone's life, but it just one added a interesting thing
260300	263740	especially when you're on the internet man, and you I mean, I mean the other thing is
264740	267700	You're not a guy. I don't know that does let's say
268300	271860	Well, I'm gonna assume this innocuous tech reviews or
273020	275900	Something that's like, I don't know lifestyle blogs you in fact
275900	282220	Yeah, it's I talk about controversial stuff. So it's quite controversial. So I right certainly good to take some measures
282540	286220	But yeah, as I said the flow is yours Paul just I
286900	290820	Appreciate like a stream of consciousness. Just what are your thoughts on the wash debate? Sure
291660	297420	well, it was interesting so I went into that debate prepared for a wide range of
298420	303180	Potential outcomes. I did not know if Vosh was gonna come out saying
303860	308700	Jordan Peterson's a Nazi and so is this guy and he was just gonna start throwing dirt from the beginning
308700	311740	That was a potentiality. So I had to mentally prepare like I
312340	314340	Gotta get ready to do that
315140	319540	You know, I've watched plenty of Vosh's videos for like years. So I knew I
320900	327260	Knew what he believed. Well, I knew what part of him believed. I knew what part of him professed
327420	331700	on his videos and I knew that, you know, I at his best
331700	335660	He's a very different person from who he is at his worst, right? Which, you know
336420	339260	I think you could say that you could say that for everyone, but
339780	347660	Brahmin when you have an online persona, I think that's amplified that spread between who you really are and the character or the persona you play
349940	351180	So
351180	356060	yeah, I you know, I didn't know how I was gonna go so I had to prepare for a wide range of outcomes and
357900	361020	I'm not gonna lie and I said this in the my reflection
361020	366180	I was very nervous in the first couple minutes. My heart was beating
366860	370020	Like to the point where I was like I might have to turn off the camera and
370500	372900	Take a lap or something because I might have a panic attack
374380	379700	Which I was interested. I knew I'd be nervous, but you know, I just I guess when you're in the moment
379700	383180	It's different and there was a strange element of you know
383180	388580	I watch Vosh again for years and I see him on the camera talking and then
389020	393540	It was kind of a weird feeling for a minute where it was like he's responding to exactly
393540	397180	I'm on the camera next to him and he's responding to what I'm saying. So it's like
397780	400220	It was it was it was you have the virtual
401060	402900	screen and then I
402900	407180	Was somehow engaged with it in a way that I wasn't before even though it was the exact same format that I consume it in
407180	409180	So it was very interesting. It was just an interesting
410180	411460	Ah
411460	413460	feeling and perception
414780	423140	But overall, you know, I came it my goal is I didn't know what I had to approach this whole thing carefully because on the one hand
424500	426060	One could argue
426060	430420	What's the point of even engaging with someone like Vosh, right? There's the very cynical like okay?
430420	434340	It'd be you know, I've watched him for a while and I want to argue with him about the stuff
434340	438940	He said, you know, he's got a big audience. It's nice to get that exposure. There's like those cynical reasons
439180	444860	But the the reason of like and not I don't mean cynical as in that those are non-factors. Those are just less than the
445380	447380	It's it's ultimately more than about that
450100	452100	You know, it's like
452300	453660	Do I
453660	456620	Come in with a bunch of quotes prepared to like
457100	462420	Pin him down and say you said these things and I can create a bunch of clippable moments of all the dumb
462420	467820	You know of of me pulling up a quote directly at contradiction with what he said like for example
468420	474620	I don't know how much you wash wash or the people watching watch. Oh, I you know, just just to I guess to clarify
474620	479140	I am very much on Vosh's side politically and I pretty interesting
480500	485300	I mean, I I that's so funny the way to label myself probably would be well
485300	491340	I probably call myself a Christian socialist, but I think really realistically. I'm a libertarian socialist
491340	493340	So
493740	495740	I'm very much on Vosh's side
495740	502340	Probably the the trans stuff and some of his I think unwarranted criticisms of
502900	509500	Conservatives but politically I'm very much on his side. Yeah, so you don't think that all conservatives are the equivalent of Ku Klux Klan
509940	512960	Absolutely, not mine. I can okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. You're politically
513460	519380	Like from a policy prescription on certain things that makes sense. I mean, I would agree with him a lot in certain policies
519500	521500	Um
521820	528460	Okay, so so yeah, so you know, so you know his drama with shoe on head. Oh, yes, okay
530060	533800	Full disclosure, I didn't follow the drama. I know it was a huge thing
533800	536300	Okay, you know, but I didn't follow that bit
536300	541940	I what I normally do is when there's some one way especially given that I live in Australia and you know
541940	546500	It's hard to keep up with what's going on in in your country, man. Cuz I'm bloody hell, man
546500	554600	No, it's hard to keep up. It's never ending. It's never ending. What's what like, you know, it's like I think I already told you this but when America
556700	562700	Sneezes the whole world gets a cold. So whatever happens to America just kind of spreads across especially the Western world
563700	567540	But whenever something breaks break, let's say there's like a news item or something
568060	573740	Happens in America. I'd generally go to like Vosh. I generally go to let's say
574340	577980	David Pacman, so I'm gonna be totally up front with you. I'm very biased
577980	580940	I'm I normally go to leftist channels cuz my so interesting
580940	585420	I would not have gathered that from at least our last conversation and but but you know
585580	592140	It just speaks to people are different and have different perspectives and we can still I mean, it's interesting because I I
592580	595900	Don't know. It's it's a this is where I really appreciate
596500	599620	conversations like this in many many issues
600060	605420	Amagnostic, however, I'd say when it comes to politics and especially economics
605700	613580	I'm pretty much a socialist almost a socialist or or to put it lightly like a social democrat and part of that is probably because I live in
613580	617700	Australia where look my like over here the the political party
617700	622220	So we've got the we've got labor and the liberals so the liberals are right wing party
623300	629300	They're you know, they're quite they kind of similar prescriptions in general like no one
629620	633220	If a politician comes here and says, let's you know, let's get rid of
634060	637860	Medicare, which is a public health care service. Yep. That's no good money by the stake
637860	642700	You know that they have mandatory voting in Australia, right? Was that don't you have mandatory voting? We do. Yes
642940	646100	I'll be look some people just pay the fine. It's like a small amount
646660	652260	But I think that's a good thing. Honestly, like even though I am quite cynical about democracy
652620	659300	And that's just my personal prejudice. I think it's a good thing. I think I think oh Pearson talks about this that it's
659620	664740	In fact, like a civic duty for a part of country. Sure. Yeah, sorry. I don't mean to
665140	668340	Well, yeah, so this is well tight. So back to shoe on head
668340	675780	So for people who are not aware or kind of aware shoe on head is an online influencer. She's like a century
675780	680180	She's a Bernie. She's like a female Bernie bro in the most stereotypical sense, right?
680820	685620	She's like socialist, but she's got some I would say common sense perspectives on when it comes to culture
685940	691300	She broke or was it had a big hand in bringing the Balenciaga scandal to light
691780	698100	The whole thing about the the children in the photo shoot with the very questionable to questionable to put it lightly
698340	700340	That was that was
700900	705620	Right. So she brought that to light and rightfully called it out as creepy weird
706100	708100	Yes, yeah, and
708580	712740	Of course on the far far left. There's a small minority of people who say
713460	715460	That is like somehow
715940	717940	bigoted to call out
718020	720020	bdsm stuff with children
720100	722260	because there's a whole history of like
723300	725300	Queer extreme queer
725860	729300	Like kink type stuff is a form of revolutionary
730820	735220	Engagement with the world or some shit. There's some intellectual rationalization for why
735940	742500	Leather fetishism around children is somehow, you know, this morally sophisticated belief and shoe on head like most people said
742740	748900	Yeah, bullshit and a big chunk of the left got upset with shoe on head and a big chunk of vosh's audience got upset with shoe on head
749300	753060	So vosh came out with this whole criticism of shoe on head saying
753620	755620	basically shoe you
756100	760900	Gave fodder to far right activists to be transphobic and and bigoted and all this stuff
761860	764660	But we're still friends because they're friends in in real life
765620	770180	So what I could have done in that debate is like and I had and I was prepared to do this if it got
770740	775940	To the point where mud was being slung back and forth, but I was I was like I'm not going to go in trying to instigate that
777300	779460	I was I could you know, I could have said something effective
779460	782740	Hey, you know how you just labeled Jordan Peterson of fascist for these reasons
783140	790660	Explain to me right now and I would just read off a quote. You said shoe on head is literally feeding fodder to far right
791220	793220	homophobes
793380	794500	You know
794500	798980	And and feeding into conspiracy. How does that not make shoe on head a fascist?
799220	802260	But Jordan Peterson is a fascist and that you know
802580	805540	There's all the drama of a big chunk of his audience doesn't
806020	811860	Like shoe on head for the reasons we just described because they think she's doing far right reactionary stuff somehow
812100	814340	They unironically refer to shoe on head of fascist
814980	816980	so the point of all that is
817620	821380	Had it gone south I would have been prepared, but I didn't want it to go south
821380	827300	I wanted to bring out the best in vosh. That was my goal was let me be as honest and authentic as possible
827860	829860	say what I believe to be true and
831540	832820	ask
832820	837620	And and talk to vosh the person rather than the persona that has all these
838260	841460	ideas that are you know intellectually interesting and
842500	844500	questionable
844580	848020	And I wanted to get to the person so what so what ended up happening is
848420	853940	I ended up just kind of going with the flow of the conversation a bit more than I think I would have liked to on
854340	858900	On on reflection because I would have liked to hit have engaged directly with some of his
859780	863940	Critiques about for example moral anti-realism. We had that discussion about what do you mean by evil?
864420	868020	And I knew what he wanted to get into in that level of conversation
868500	874260	But I again, I was kind of interested in sticking with the well look we can have a discussion about what we mean by evil
874980	879380	But we're going to end up on this we're going to both agree that the Nazis were evil
880020	885220	So like let's just the conversation I want to have is more about why do you call conservatives?
885700	893060	Kkk members and do you understand how that makes people feel and stuff like that versus just engaging at the purely intellectual level of here's why I don't think
893940	899940	You know here's morality and stuff. It would have been interesting conversation though because moral realism versus moral anti-realism is interesting
900660	904500	Um, you know one thing that factored into the whole debate was
905380	910580	A lot of my friends were watching the debate live and you know, they're not people who are really interested in these topics
910740	915460	Or you know, some of them would barely even know who Jordan Peterson is or even Karl Marx or anything like that
916180	918180	So there was a part of me. That's like I all
919140	921940	I want to speak to someone who doesn't have who's not
922900	925460	Who doesn't even know what moral realism or anti-realism is right?
925460	929860	Which is most people because most people have actual jobs and lives to live and they don't have all this free time to
930580	932580	obsess about philosophy and stuff which
933140	938820	That's a that's a cynical way of looking at things oftentimes there are that what I just described is a subset of people
939540	942100	arguably philosophy is the most important thing because it you know
942820	944820	We're all nested in philosophy
944980	951300	But but when it's just like well, it's what is evil like to the average person is just like what what kind of conversation is this?
951300	954820	What do you mean? What what it's like the Nazis were evil. Can we can we just start there and move forward?
955860	957620	so
957620	962580	You know, I was sort of like let you know, let me let me have the conversation. That's more relevant here
962580	967220	Which is boss. Do you understand why calling conservatives KKK members is not good, right?
967860	969860	independent of all this intellectual stuff
970420	975060	um, so there was that the other thing I would have liked to have gone into is the cultural Marxism bit and um
975540	980100	I you know that again that would have been the same thing. We're going to go deep into the intellectual stuff and
981780	983300	You know how
983300	988020	Relevant that is for people watching. How many minds would be changed that way? I'm not sure, you know
990740	992740	My perspective is
993860	999060	You don't change people's minds by logic. You change people's minds by embodying um
1000340	1002100	authentic
1002100	1006260	Behavior right honest and that's what I was trying to do. I'm not coming in to dunk. I'm not coming in to
1006980	1011300	Beat you on the intellectual grounds. I'm coming in to articulate what my problem is with you vosh
1011940	1016820	And honestly and give credit where credit is due because I know because like and I've seen him give good advice
1016820	1019700	And he's a real person and he's not this one-dimensional
1020900	1023700	Troll demon as Jordan Peterson would say right so
1024740	1026740	and it's funny because
1027380	1029380	I was talking to some people
1029700	1036260	And their opinion is no vosh is like straight up evil and like he's a bad faith bad person and I was like that's so
1037220	1042180	Sim simplistic and you you're getting a narrow view. You're taking him it is worst, which is bad
1043140	1045140	and using that to to
1045940	1050340	Him it is worst is him all the time and and I I've just from watching him over the years
1050420	1055460	Know that that's not the case and it's funny because you mentioned you you said you you agree with vosh a lot. It's like
1056980	1059380	This is my point. I have a friend who's a big fan of vosh
1060260	1062260	from from college and uh
1063220	1069780	And the idea is like if you who in my opinion, I don't know you you know, well at all really but from the conversations
1069780	1075300	We've had more than reasonable person, you know, we could we could easily see me, you know hanging out with you and whatnot
1078020	1080020	Yeah, well there you go
1080660	1083860	I shall introduce you to something called a chicken pama
1084580	1087220	And you want to change melbourne specialty
1087620	1092580	It is it is well, I think it's an australian thing, but uh, but in melbourne, it's huge and you
1093220	1098180	I'm sure I'm gonna convert you fully to an australian. You're gonna you're gonna denounce you american citizens
1098980	1102740	Take it. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Thanks for having to keep going. My point is
1103620	1105060	how I
1105060	1108660	I don't like you are not someone who I think would
1109300	1114980	I like would be a fan of someone who was genuinely evil or like a genuinely bad person, right? Like if you were a fan of
1115780	1119700	Who's like a like david duke? You would be you would have a different personality, right?
1120180	1124500	This interaction would not be going the way that it is. I mean you can not to say that
1125540	1129140	You know far-right people can't be polite and can't hide their beliefs
1129780	1131780	But like, you know, it's just the nature of it
1131780	1134420	Like if you really believe some people were superior to others then
1135140	1141220	We wouldn't be having this conversation as equals almost, right? So my my that's a roundabout way of saying
1142180	1145780	I wanted to bring out the best I wanted to speak to the best part of vosh
1145860	1149620	And I wanted to bring the best part of myself and I and I was prepared to kind of
1150660	1152660	Go nuclear if need be
1153300	1157220	But that wasn't my goal and I think part of the reason the debate didn't go as
1158260	1161460	Didn't dig into the topics I would have liked to it's partly because it was just
1162660	1166740	That navigating that split the first 20 minutes. I'm like, I don't know how this is gonna go, right?
1166900	1169140	and when I settled in then it was kind of like well
1170100	1174980	We're having more it's almost like we're having more of a conversation and of an exchange and to
1176260	1179860	Force the cut the debate into one topic or another then becomes a little unnatural
1179860	1182660	And that's that's not me being as authentic as I could otherwise be
1183220	1188660	But now that I've established some rapport with vosh if there's an opportunity to speak again, you know, we could I would love to
1189300	1193140	Go into for example, like cultural Marxism specifically and just have a whole debate about that
1193700	1195700	And the last thing I'll say it's interesting
1196340	1198660	When it came to the trans issues I said specifically
1199220	1201300	Anyone watching this I'm willing to
1202100	1204420	Have a debate where we can pull up the studies in advance
1204820	1211300	Send me one quality study that demonstrates the efficacy of medical transition in children
1211300	1214980	There are none the reason I said I'm confident they don't exist is because I am confident
1214980	1219780	They don't exist and it's funny because that debate has 200,000 views or something and I know for a fact there's a lot of
1220420	1222580	vosh orbiters and and and people who
1223540	1229940	If those studies existed it would be glad to take me up on that debate and I've heard nothing yet so far because it doesn't exist and so
1232020	1236340	You know that so the the points that I wanted to make or felt were important to make were made
1237860	1239860	At least from my perspective so um
1240660	1244980	But yeah, that's that's my initial reflection and kind of on a pastor. I guess yeah
1245860	1248660	Well two two points. Uh, the first thing is I think
1249380	1254420	And I'm I'm not trying to you know, um, I mean this sincerely. I'm not trying to like uh flatter you or anything
1255380	1261060	Sure, I wouldn't mind if you were though, but yeah, yeah, but you know, like sometimes flattering can be insincere, right?
1261060	1264420	Yes, I think for the sake of saying nice things. Uh
1265460	1267940	I think the because you started off
1268820	1270980	by kind of let's say, uh
1271780	1274740	What would the caveat or the proviso that you in fact have
1275220	1276900	personally been
1276900	1284260	helped by Jordan Peterson that you in fact just leaving aside his politics just uh applying practically applying
1285060	1287060	let's say his his
1287140	1291140	uh psychological prescriptions or his self-help prescriptions have helped your life
1292180	1295380	That instantly built like a bridge like a human bridge between
1295860	1301540	Wash and yourself. I might want to be like, oh no, that means you both are on the same page. In fact, look, uh,
1301700	1307620	This is where again, you and I may disagree. I don't believe one can be a centrist. So I'll get into that a bit later
1308100	1312420	Okay, very theoretical. There's a very theoretical reason for that. Uh, and I get it from Slavoj Zizek
1313140	1319060	Who I happen to be a big fan of like I'd consider myself essentially Zizek here. Uh, yeah, um
1319620	1325940	The second point is so I I do want to give you credit for that. Um, I I'm not a big fan of debates, man
1325940	1328980	to be honest, I generally after a political debate
1329700	1336020	I come off feeling dispirited feeling a bit cynical feeling like both both sides were just either
1336740	1338660	uh, you know
1338660	1341060	throwing mud at each other or just purely
1341700	1347620	Talking past each other, but this for the first time after this debate. I I I felt good just leaving aside all the
1348340	1350740	Intellectual systems. I was like that was a good conversation
1350820	1357540	Like this this guy paul who is someone I like I enjoy his videos and then there's this guy wash who I
1357940	1363460	Watched quite a lot now and politically we aligned quite a lot and I'd like there was a dialogue going
1364020	1364900	and
1364900	1370500	Correct me if I'm wrong didn't even wash wash say that it was the end of it that he in fact appreciated the conversation
1371300	1376100	Yeah, yeah, the um, it's funny. I didn't know this until afterward, you know, we
1376900	1379780	The debate ended and then wash was still streaming on his side
1380580	1383220	And I found you know as soon as the debate ended. He said
1384180	1386180	something like
1386260	1390340	I actually really did enjoy talking to paul. Um, you know, he's a real guy, you know, obviously
1390580	1393060	And he said what you said, you know, paul said up front. He's
1393700	1395700	emotionally invested in these issues
1396020	1398020	But he wasn't lying about it, which is like
1398500	1402100	Uh, you know a step above all the I think he said giggling frenetic
1402820	1408420	Liars that he normally argues with who you know misrepresent their views and all that stuff. Um, and
1409940	1415620	Yeah, and it's funny. So the first to to the point about building a bridge kind of the beginning of acknowledging my biases
1420340	1422100	It's almost like
1422100	1424580	From my the bar is so fucking
1425140	1427460	Forgive my french. The bar is so fucking low
1428100	1429620	online
1429620	1430660	where
1430660	1432660	Just being honest like hey
1433060	1437300	The reason I spent all this time talking about topic x y and z
1437860	1443220	Is because it is personally in you know, not just interesting but impactful to me in these ways
1444100	1446100	and for me, it's like
1446100	1452580	You know, I went to therapy and so I can I made that connection explicit of the topics I talk about versus
1453860	1456500	Why you know how it affects how it relates to me as a person
1457860	1460580	But it's it seems like just second nature almost of like
1461540	1464500	You know that like in most political debates, well people wouldn't do that
1464580	1470660	You know, they wouldn't say out front like hey, I'm biased and and I don't know maybe certainly the online politics space
1470740	1472740	there's just a lot of people who are
1473460	1474500	probably
1474500	1476420	and no names or anything but
1476420	1480820	Probably a good chunk of them are narcissistic and only care about the money and care about the attention and could you know
1481380	1485300	Would just as avidly argue for one side of the political spectrum as they would another
1487140	1491940	And so that's I think I totally understand when it's like I watch political debate and it's just like, okay, this was pointless
1492900	1494100	um
1494100	1496100	but you know, I
1496980	1499300	I just my thought is like
1500260	1507300	Okay, if my parents or my friends or my family or if they watch my video would they think like this is a different person than
1507860	1509860	who paul is in real life
1510260	1515940	Then I've failed somehow. It's it's a form of lie, right? You know, and there's obviously nuance in like
1515940	1521940	You know, I'm not going to have a conversation exactly as I do in private as I would if I know
1522260	1524900	You know, 8,000 people are watching live in 200,000 people are going to see it
1525540	1527540	But for the most part, you know, if I'm
1528580	1531940	Careful and conscious I can have a pretty open honest conversation and
1533300	1539460	So, yeah, I think the biggest issue online and it's funny because we're in a generation where this is a challenge for us
1540180	1542180	that other generations haven't faced before is
1542900	1547060	Exactly, how do you navigate the online persona versus who you really are?
1547700	1549700	right and some people do it by
1550580	1552180	You know, some people say like I don't want to talk about in private life
1552260	1556420	Like they're academics or or or people who do like video essays who are like I'm a private person
1556500	1558500	I don't like talking about my life at all. I just like talking about the idea
1559220	1561220	and that's fine, but
1561300	1563300	that's
1563620	1568740	Limited I think in a significant degree because how do I know I don't know your motivations, right?
1568900	1574180	You're just a disembodied voice that does a video essay. I don't know anything about why you're doing it and
1575540	1580100	How often I think it's important when you're evaluating the merits of like a political idea
1580420	1584740	You need to understand the motivations of the person reporting those ideas, right?
1584740	1589220	So like for a mathematics, you know, someone teaching you calculus doesn't matter if they're sociopath or not
1589460	1593060	The math is the math what they say can translate one to one. There's no
1594020	1596260	Band there's no bandwidth loss because they're a bad person
1596580	1601060	But when it comes to like political or psych psychological or philosophical ideas, it's the opposite
1601060	1603060	It's like you have to it's all about
1603620	1606820	The character the philosophical temperament of the person putting forth the idea
1607380	1610100	So I'm always trying to operate at the level of
1611140	1614820	I am here not just on a screen talking about ideas. I'm a person
1615860	1619860	You know, you know real life context coming into you in this moment
1620900	1623860	but to to view it anything other than that I think is
1624740	1626100	dangerous and
1626100	1628100	uninteresting and ineffective
1628980	1630980	That makes sense
1631300	1636340	Now, I see what you're saying. I think I mostly agree. Um, however a part of me also
1637460	1642660	So you made the point previously that most people aren't interested in theory and philosophy
1642900	1649140	Uh, yes, and I happen to be one of those weird guys that just likes reading philosophy and same. Yes, me too. I've got
1649700	1653060	Yeah, I've got Ian McGill chris. Master is on the map
1654740	1659220	Right. This is most people in it perfectly intelligent people would go
1660020	1666340	That's kind of nerdy and whatever and I'm not going to take it that any particular interest in it and that's perfectly acceptable
1666340	1671380	That's exactly how I feel about like quantum physics, right? I'm not really that interested in theoretical physics
1672020	1677300	Maybe eventually I will be because it appears to be merging with religion and psychedelics, but you know, that's a separate thing
1677700	1681140	Yeah, but well, I mean, that's what comes in. Uh, so the idea of like
1681780	1682580	one one
1682580	1684580	Well, there are many definitions of philosophy
1684820	1690100	But one definition I like is what boveky points out you take all these different disciplines
1690100	1693140	So you be it cognitive science or quantum physics or
1693700	1698260	Sociology for god's sake and you try to bridge and find connections between them
1698820	1701300	Which is where I think an eclectic
1701940	1703060	kind of thinker
1703140	1708020	Okay, uh, one of my heroes zhizhek does where he connects all these different
1708820	1710980	His his kind of like his magnum opus
1711860	1716660	Let me let me get it. Sure. Uh, I I'm slowly going through it. It's
1717380	1720260	It's his book on hegel. Uh, it's called less than nothing
1720740	1722740	By zhizhek. It's just look at that. It's a big boy
1723300	1726020	I'm I'm still going through this and like in this book he takes
1726740	1728740	There's a chapter where he connects
1729700	1732820	a quantum physics with this hegelian idea of of
1733380	1735940	He calls it the incompleteness of reality
1736500	1737940	uh, and
1737940	1741140	Some people would find that bizarre because he also brings up
1741780	1748420	Uh, you know, like pop culture movies like batman and harry porter while also ringing up on a physics. So it's it's very interesting
1749140	1755700	But yeah, but then I do think and here's where maybe I sort of disagree with you, uh, paul
1755700	1758100	Sure is I still think it's important
1758820	1762580	to focus on theory because I think thinking is quite necessary and
1763940	1765940	what I mean, so
1766580	1770740	Just just to clarify that when I'm saying it's important to focus on theory. I'm not saying
1771300	1779860	Oh, that means one is indifferent to it or apathetic to it. It's impossible. You know, I I I don't think you could just be interested in theory
1780500	1782500	without in fact
1782500	1789540	Being a a a an embodied being with a life with with motivations emotions and and all the uh,
1790100	1793140	It's kind of like what niche has said. He you know, niche has famously said that
1794500	1798740	Every philosophy is the biography of the philosopher. So for niche, uh
1799940	1806580	Philosophy doesn't just exist abstractly out there, which is why he's like the proto-exception. That's like william james philosophical temperaments, right?
1806820	1808820	interesting
1809300	1814100	Yeah, that's that's that's you know, there are different different personalities
1814900	1817060	project different philosophies. So like a super
1818180	1822660	Left-brained to put it simply kind of like engineer type person will have a very analytic
1823300	1825300	germy bentham, uh, I think it's
1826020	1828660	Rationalist philosophy. It's just pure abstract and then there's the more
1829460	1833380	um empiricist side rationalism versus empiricism is his dichotomy where it's like
1834340	1839860	In the world sensory type stuff versus at the abstract. So it's different philosophical personalities temperaments
1840100	1845780	So that seems to line up with niche's claim that you just made. Oh, yes, certainly. And you know, here it's funny. Um
1846500	1850100	Heidegger in one of his lectures on Aristotle famously said
1850580	1853620	Uh, Aristotle was a man that was born. He
1854500	1856500	Philosophized and he died. That's all that matters
1856900	1861780	Nothing else about Aristotle matters and and I think what heidegger was trying to do there was in fact say
1862420	1869380	Forget about getting too kind of obsessed and building this kind of cult cult persona or Aristotle or whoever just
1869860	1871860	focus on the theory just
1872580	1875620	That's a theory itself. Nothing more nothing less
1876340	1880340	um, and I the reason I say that that's still important is because
1882180	1886420	Okay, this is a bit hard for me to articulate, but I'm gonna try my best. So please be with me Paul
1886500	1891460	uh, I think we we are making a mistake in contemporary society where we
1892180	1893620	medicalize and
1893620	1895620	Psychologize everything
1896260	1900980	So the even even a human being is reduced to like you said a dichotomy machine. Yeah
1901220	1907620	Yeah, the left left brain or right brain and and I see the I see the temptation to do that because like, you know, I'm a soft engineer
1907620	1911460	That's my day job and I love I love thinking analytically
1912100	1915940	And I love thinking in like a very uh systematic way. Let's say
1916740	1919220	However, uh, the more I've I've got
1919860	1925460	Into more deeper philosophy like Lacan for instance like Lacan believes for instance that an authentic person doesn't exist
1926100	1928100	so Lacan talks about that year of uh
1928740	1931460	He says that the way we form our desires
1932100	1938180	Is not but is not by what we authentically won't but in fact the other he calls it the other
1938980	1940980	Tells us what to desire
1941140	1945220	And someone like Gizek connects that to consumerism and you know, commodity finishes him and all that
1945220	1952100	That sounds like uh, Rene Girard mimesis too, which is interesting. I'm not familiar. I mean, I I'm only just getting introduced into Girard
1952180	1955860	But yeah, Rene Girard mimesis m i m e s i s
1956340	1957700	That's the whole
1957700	1962740	All of our desires are just other desires other desires. How do I desire what other people desire?
1963140	1966580	How do I how do I spell that m? Rene Girard g i r
1967540	1974820	Girard, no, I go I go Rene Girard, but the yeah mimesis m i m e s i s men mimesis
1975780	1979860	And then gotcha. Yes. So which is different from memetic
1980740	1986260	The Richard Dawkins idea, which is m because it's there's a medic from the Girardian
1986500	1990180	Yeah, so there's so there's memetic from the Girardian point of view
1990500	1995060	Then there's memetic from the Richard Dawkins point of view, which is like the word meme came from that
1996020	2003940	Meme mimesis in the Girardian point of view is different subtle distinction, but but no, but this is this case in point
2004020	2007940	Here's what I mean. So what I'm trying to say is I I do think
2008740	2010740	It's important that the in fact
2011220	2014660	Sit down and think like we so so Zizek has this really good line
2014820	2019220	He he and Zizek is a as a communist, right? He's a leftist. He's a radical leftist and he says
2019780	2025300	Yes, you know what I would like is the day the the the revolution in before and later
2025540	2030500	What happens after the revolution, you know, that's fine with a couple for the couples in there
2030740	2033540	That's my terrible Zizek impression. But the point is trying to make us
2034180	2037300	And and and he's this is why I like him because he's as a leftist
2037300	2040660	He's he's challenging the left and he's asking. Hey, okay
2041220	2046260	The revolution's great. It's the romantic feeling. Let's overthrow the system
2046740	2052900	But what happens the day after and here's where he says theory and philosophy matters where we don't
2053380	2056900	We don't say that. Oh, let's just explain everything everything
2057220	2060180	Via psychology. Oh, let's let's let's explain everything via
2060660	2062660	Neuroscience or cognitive science
2063140	2068340	Let's let's sit and think and he even connects that to this idea called
2068740	2075220	I would prefer not to what what he means by that is sometimes the the greatest act of let's say, uh
2075780	2079140	subversion of the system is in fact not taking part in the system
2079380	2081220	It's saying no, I'm not going to buy that thing
2081300	2086180	I'm not going to buy the next generation of the iPhone or whatever and not buy not let
2086660	2090260	The the desire of the other affect my own desire even though
2090740	2092580	Again, not to get too technical
2092580	2096740	But like how would say that's impossible that we are always desiring like what it means to be human is in fact
2096900	2098900	You desire which I think I agree
2099460	2106740	Uh, and and now maybe uh, Paul if you don't mind I could connect this to my my point about fascism. So
2108340	2109620	After
2109620	2111620	listening to the debate for the
2111860	2114980	Well, I kind of got this for some but I I re-listened to it
2115860	2120980	Here's where I think where wash was coming from and I'm I'm kind of here thoughts
2121940	2123460	so
2123460	2125060	for for wash
2125220	2128020	Fascist where he defined fascism wasn't
2128820	2135300	He was being purely theoretical about it as and he wasn't trying to say a fascist is an evil person
2136020	2142500	He was he was trying to be so the the way I put it as that he was trying to get rid of the moral baggage of what fascism is
2142900	2145620	And he would define it as a let's say a social structure
2146260	2152900	As a theoretical social structure as a as a phenomenon in society as to how fascism comes to comes to be
2153700	2155700	Uh, which is why he used uh
2156500	2160260	Uh, umberto echoes a list which I think is a pretty good list to be honest
2160260	2164340	Even though I kind of come I take my definition of fascism more from hannah arendt's
2165220	2168100	Book because I think she is a lot more, uh
2168820	2170340	comprehensive
2170340	2172340	And then what what he was trying to say is
2173860	2178500	You know, we we think of and you know, you probably would agree with this because jordan pilson talks about this
2178900	2179780	um
2179780	2185060	You think of a fascist as some crazy, uh, you know, forgive me for being a bit racist
2185060	2187060	But like german-speaking ass
2187060	2191460	You know, this is crazy. I've been out of the consignancies, but I can wish confancies. You know, that was a pretty good
2191780	2197060	That was a pretty good. You even did that in a debate, didn't you? Yeah. Yeah. I thought you were actually speaking german
2197060	2202980	I know, I know it's pretty good. Um, yeah, and and you think that this angry guy who who looks like
2203860	2204900	You know
2204980	2206660	The devil himself
2206660	2210500	But no, it's in fact fascism is a a social phenomena
2210580	2216420	It's it's it's something that's rather banal in fact and all of us can can become be fascist
2216500	2218500	If we have a certain way of thinking
2218500	2222980	Which is why I think it's important to to study the phenomena as a sociologist should
2223540	2228260	And then try and lay down some kind of theory for it because if we don't have theory then
2228820	2234340	Everything we leave to the whims of let's say emotion or psychology or we or we overtly
2235060	2237860	Spiritualize it, which is another thing another element of fascism
2238580	2239860	so
2239860	2243220	Again, just to reiterate. I'm sorry if I'm uh, you know being a bit like questions
2243780	2245140	the
2245140	2248660	Well, I think what wash was trying to put forward is that yes, of course
2248740	2254740	He certainly hates conservatives. You could see it vehemently, but he's also trying to state that
2255460	2257460	hey, uh, you know
2257460	2260180	Fascism isn't something that was unique to the 20th century
2260260	2264100	It wasn't something that was just like this once in a moment thing in human history
2264500	2269860	It's in fact a recurring social phenomena, which we can study theoretically historically and
2270420	2272740	It's it's in fact rather
2273540	2275540	naive and dangerous to think that
2276340	2281460	Or it was those people that were the fascist. It was those crazy Germans or the crazy italians
2281860	2284340	It was in but the social phenomena
2285300	2293700	In the structure of society can emerge anytime and he believes and to a certain extent. I believe this too that there's a
2294740	2296740	There's a kind of a let's say a
2296900	2298660	resurrection or
2298660	2300340	or there's a
2300340	2304580	And another form of fascism that's coming into our society right now
2306180	2310980	You know case in point, uh, the ccp the chinese communist party. I think they're in fact a
2311940	2314420	I think china is very much a fascist state
2315140	2319460	Sure, sure. So, um, Canada seems to be going that way a little bit too
2320020	2324980	Well, yes, I know that he seems to be fighting a lot about that. But yeah, but you see the point, right?
2325540	2330020	Yes, because you think, you know, canada or liberal democracy, right?
2331220	2335860	But yeah, so the merge, uh, but anyway, yeah, does that make sense? Sorry. I was wrong. Yeah. No, that all makes sense
2335940	2338180	and it's interesting. Yes, so I so
2339140	2341140	Um
2341300	2343300	Well, I got a couple things
2343460	2348100	So first off, I absolutely understand and agree
2349620	2353060	With the idea that fascism is not just as some mystical
2354100	2358100	abstract idea it it can reemerge and is reemerging in many ways
2359380	2361060	that
2361060	2362420	and maybe
2362420	2364420	And again, this
2364500	2367780	This was partly a consequence of what conversation I was trying to have
2368660	2370660	rather than
2371220	2373060	Not
2373060	2374260	well
2374260	2378260	I didn't the conversation didn't go the way that it, you know, we might have right now
2378660	2381940	Because it was a debate with a, you know, there was all those other factors to consider
2382420	2386020	And I was again more interested in having the meta conversation about vosh's
2386580	2389940	Conversation rather than on the topic itself. So what I would say is
2390900	2396660	The idea that fascism is something that could reemerge is like that's the central idea Jordan Pearson's work, right?
2396740	2401780	I'm gonna teach you how to that. I'm gonna teach you that you could that you would have been an Auschwitz prison guard had
2402580	2404580	The same circumstances, um,
2404660	2409220	Arisen in time every one of us contains within us the capacity for evil the moment you say
2409940	2411940	Those people are uniquely bad
2411940	2417940	You are now exactly the kind of person who would do bad thing, you know, the worst type of things because you have no idea how
2418900	2425300	You have you have no understanding of your own capability of evil and therefore you have no way of preventing yourself from being tempted into that
2425940	2427940	So I believe that
2428340	2431220	The and I did say this more. I think I said this
2431940	2433940	I said fascism means bad person
2434980	2436980	and
2436980	2441780	I meant in that the average person that's what that means, right?
2441780	2445540	Nazi means bad person to the average person, right?
2445620	2449780	Nazi just Nazi doesn't mean a national socialist person from
2450580	2456660	1940s who was interested in the 15 point Nazi plan that Hitler laid out in 1930 Nazi just means
2457540	2459540	Nazi equals bad and it's an archetype
2460340	2462340	Yeah, can I
2462340	2466340	For but that's sorry. I know you were kind of going on a point there, but yeah, no, go ahead. This is where I think
2467060	2469060	Vosch in fact makes a good point because
2469620	2470580	you know
2470580	2474020	the average person who thinks Nazi means bad person just
2474020	2478980	or bad bad guy or whatever is wrong and here's where theory comes in because
2479620	2482180	Yes, I mean, of course, Nazi is a terrible
2482740	2484740	I've got to say
2484740	2487140	It's complicated, right because it's a nuanced point because
2487620	2492260	You know, Gizek talks about this idea of uh, you know, Henry Kimmler and Goebbels
2492740	2499620	These guys plan they they architected the holocaust and at night they were listening to Wagner and Beethoven and
2500580	2502580	Yeah, they were having dinner parties and
2503220	2509540	Yeah, you know, they were living a typical bourgeois life, you know, and and you think oh, look at these sophisticated posh people
2510020	2513140	Haha, and they're very educated. How could they be nazis?
2513220	2518100	But that that is in fact why I love uh, again, hanaro and I keep I know I keep going on about her
2518180	2523140	But she is my one of my favorite political philosophers. It's that there are these structural
2524180	2528020	There are these structures that can give rise to fascism, which I think is what
2528580	2530580	Wash is more concerned about
2530740	2535860	And of course, he's got his own, you know personal proclivities to hate conservatives. That's a different story
2536340	2540900	But I think yes, and it's not even and Russia. I think his persona hates conservatives
2540980	2543780	I don't even I don't believe he does personally. I think he
2544340	2549540	Plays the role of someone who hates conservatives, but he certainly doesn't I bet if a conservative
2549700	2550820	He met on the street
2550820	2553620	He would not treat them the way that he would treat a kkk member
2553780	2554500	He met on the street
2554500	2557780	So I think that's a persona that he's playing and putting forward but that's
2558900	2560900	Separate issue we could go into that probably
2560980	2561540	We have a point
2561540	2568020	I mean, I've been having this thought about uh, Peterson ever since he joined daily wire to be honest that he's now becoming this
2568820	2571780	You know call it up conservative guy different to what he was
2572500	2574820	Yeah, you know prior to his fame, let's say
2575620	2577460	certainly yeah
2577460	2579460	well, so so uh
2580020	2582660	Because there's multiple doors open we could go to yeah, I know I know I know
2582820	2586260	It's just look man. This is as I said, this was not supposed to be a structure thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
2586660	2590900	Well, there was there was I'm trying to remember because it was one thing. I wanted to say in particular
2591380	2593380	but not leave evil
2593540	2594740	um
2594740	2599460	Okay, so the point about the average person thinks fascist equals bad, but that does is necessarily true
2599940	2601780	so here is where
2601780	2603780	and and this it's it's
2604980	2610180	Life is full of paradoxes and every day I realize I'm realizing that life is a paradox in and of itself
2610180	2614660	It's a point Zizek makes he makes the he says in this book the only universal is conflict
2615060	2618180	The only yes. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Perfect. Yeah, because
2620180	2621620	So
2621620	2626340	Is it true that nazi equals bad person? They're more or less synonyms. Well
2627540	2629540	From a pragmatist perspective
2630420	2636020	Uh, yeah, it's like saying is it is it is it true that satan equals bad? Yeah, it's like
2636900	2641060	Yeah, it's like well is satan bad. It's like, yes satan is bad. You know, that's how everyone uses it
2641380	2643380	Something says this is a satanic act
2644100	2649940	You know, that's bad. Yeah, but like satan was an angel, right? And there's this whole complicated like thing of like, well, there's a
2652580	2654580	People
2654580	2658420	are embodied people act in the in the in the in the day to day world and
2659380	2664980	What's something whether or not a whether or not a statement is true is dependent on the behavior that it
2666900	2668900	Uh corresponds to so like
2670420	2674820	And this is the whole the the reason I said the whole paradox thing is like because pragmatism is all about truth
2674820	2679860	Is a function of utility and so if people are using that language in a certain way, then it is true
2679940	2681940	Then then it's true in that sense
2683540	2687460	But like the whole nazi is bad thing. It's like nazi is equal bad. Yes, but
2688100	2690820	You could you have the capacity to be a nazi. So just saying
2691780	2698100	It's bad people is wrong or that bad is something outside of you and that you're not capable of partaking yourself. That's wrong
2699140	2701140	and
2701140	2702580	my
2702580	2709060	Goal and the way I approach this channel, you know, and again, this is of course the comedy channel. So I say this as a joke
2710100	2712100	but
2712420	2714420	The root of all of comedy is truth
2714500	2716260	um
2716260	2723220	Like sometimes certain discussions, it's just nerd shit. That's what I call it. So like for so for example, this is my favorite
2723940	2725220	example I give
2725220	2732020	If someone's is it an objective fact that um, you know, I'm wearing a black hoodie. Is that an objective fact?
2732820	2733940	well
2733940	2738980	To every person who is not ingrained in philosophy the answer is does
2739940	2742180	Right and and you even asking that question now
2742180	2744580	I'm suspicious of you as a person because what kind of game you trying to play
2744660	2749140	Yeah, what's funny is man when you said nerd shit and the moment you asked me that I was in my head
2749140	2753300	I was like, well, it depends. What? Well, so this is the thing. So the so the answer
2754020	2758660	Exactly. Well, and that's nerds that like philosophy and I'm in the nerd. That's what I'm in the nerd shit as well
2759620	2765300	Because you could just as easily point out and say well colors technically do not exist in the exterior world
2765780	2770580	Right colors are the experience qualia. Right the experience of seeing
2771380	2775540	Beaks, you know, it's like the whole your blue is my red classic thought experiment
2776500	2781780	And cut like and black is a bad example. We should use green. So I've got slothers of katana over there. So that's green
2782900	2784900	For people who are red green colorblind
2784900	2789700	It's actually it's like that's a very practical example of like no no no that actually isn't just green in and of itself
2789860	2792420	Or I don't actually know if they only see green or red or whatever how it works
2792420	2794500	But theoretically if you couldn't see the color
2795060	2798340	It's not it's not an is it an objective fact that that's green even if
2798980	2803780	There's people who do literally don't perceive it. It gets complicated. So there's nuance
2805460	2806980	But
2806980	2813060	Now but then but but like if if the nuance forces you to say that it's not an objective fact that this is the color red
2813060	2815540	It's like you're speaking in a way that doesn't
2816740	2818980	That you know, most people just don't
2820500	2825700	Can't get can't even understand or get behind right and so the whole when I was saying like nazi, you know
2825700	2830420	Nazi equals bad person fashion equal bad person. I was sort of approaching it from that perspective. It's like
2831300	2833140	Yes, I'm aware there's nuance here
2833140	2835140	But the conversation that I'm trying to have
2835700	2837860	Is one that we can start with
2838740	2845620	Like whatever our definition of bad is we're going to come to an agreement that nazis are bad or at least doing nazi things
2845940	2850900	Are bad nazi activity is bad activity, right? Whether they're bad people it gets nuanced but
2851620	2857060	Doing things that nazis do is the same as doing bad things and it's not that it's not as simple as that
2858420	2863860	But because again vosh has a big audience and when you get to the mass media perspective
2864740	2866740	I would say the simpler new the simpler
2868020	2870020	way of thinking about things is actually the more
2870980	2877460	Relevant way of thinking about things because that's how most people interpret it. Again, you know, what most of his audience is probably like 15 16 year olds
2878100	2880100	You know, they probably don't know
2880500	2882020	the you know
2882020	2885940	Not that I know anything but like they don't they're not approaching these issues from a
2886580	2889380	philosophically interesting like okay, how can we separate it's just like
2890340	2894180	You know, uh, the the conservative kid at my school who's bullying me as an asshole
2894260	2900740	And so this guy reinforces my perspective and you can switch that around to the conservative side where oh these liberal pretentious assholes are
2900820	2904180	You know and now this considers guys telling me why all my liberal pretentious friends are asshole
2904180	2905460	So I like it, right?
2905460	2909780	That's the that's the plane that is more relevant because if society collapses
2910420	2913220	It will be at that level of analysis
2913380	2917380	It will be at that level of conversation that failed that will cause society to fall apart
2917540	2923060	It's not but we didn't properly articulate the differences between the objective reality and subjective reality. It's
2923780	2925300	nazi's bad
2925300	2926900	communist bad
2926900	2932340	And we need to be able to from people like me whose fundamental goal is i'm trying to avoid
2933220	2937060	The end of the world. That's one of my many fundamental goals. Let's prevent society
2938020	2941300	For a comedian. It's a laudable goal for exactly. Yes, right?
2941300	2944740	And i'm doing it through and and and and to that point it's kind of like
2945380	2948660	I need the theory is correct and I and this is like conversations
2948660	2953060	You and I are having our sort of you know my bread and butter and that's what I live for
2953620	2955620	That I want to engage at this level, but when it comes to
2956340	2957620	how do I
2957620	2959620	go from this abstract conversation to
2960020	2962020	How do I communicate this to someone who
2962660	2964660	You know has to work all day
2964660	2970660	To support a family and doesn't have time for all the stuff that i'm fortunate enough that I have time to dig into these books and all that stuff
2970660	2975540	Right, and that's the approach I take on things for what it's worth. So that whole thing is a
2976980	2980660	I don't know we compassed a lot there. No, no, no, that was perfect
2980660	2985540	I think this is exactly what I was trying to get from me Paul as in certainly like a manipulative way
2986260	2987540	What I was trying to
2987540	2992100	I already for I just say because I think I get it now you see
2992980	2994980	I'm going to be told you are front with you here
2996020	2997620	This is
2997620	3001140	The goal of my channel is not I don't care about saving the world. I don't care
3001140	3004980	But even doing I care about doing good, of course, like to a certain extent as a christian. Why not?
3005380	3008580	But but it's I'm purely interested in theory
3008820	3014660	Like I want I want to move my channel to its philosophy and theory and then my other love which is computer science
3015380	3016260	so
3016260	3019380	So now but but I can see and correct me if I'm wrong here, please
3020020	3022580	Your goal isn't pure purely to talk about
3023460	3025460	Juck that it does
3025700	3029700	So oh episteme and then go on or even jordan peterson's about that, right?
3030100	3035860	Like I will do heavy theory videos, right that are like, you know, we're I'm pulling from
3036580	3038580	directly from a george leikoff
3038900	3040660	Neuroscience lecture
3040660	3043380	So I do do that, but all of that is in the context of
3044260	3046260	utility like I'm
3046260	3048260	I'm pulling all this theory for the purpose of
3049300	3055380	Making a moral prescription maybe okay, okay, or at least even if that's not if I don't explicitly make that claim
3055380	3058500	which in those videos I often do but sometimes I won't but like
3059620	3064500	There is an element of it always comes back to how does this why is this relevant, right?
3064980	3069540	Versus sort of the it sounds like correct me if I'm wrong you have sort of an aesthetic appreciation of
3070260	3072260	The ideas and the theory themselves
3072340	3076900	There's just some it's like art where it's like there's something in and of itself that speaks to you
3077940	3079940	I'm not a pragmatist certainly
3080020	3084340	What's that? I'm not a pragmatist. I don't do things for pragmatic. I do right, right?
3084500	3089860	You put it perfectly aesthetic appreciation like I love and I yeah, and I again go back to paradoxes like
3090340	3092500	I'm not saying that that I don't have that
3093060	3095060	That's not like I love
3095460	3100740	Movies and I love like like Star Wars universe and fantasy type worlds and stuff like that
3101300	3104100	And obviously there's a huge aesthetic component of that certainly
3104820	3108100	but but the way but for me the the aesthetics
3109380	3113460	Are also a function of utility in some sense where it's like like I take the evolutionary perspective where
3114260	3119460	You know like you see a sunset, right? And we know from like a scientific perspective that
3120420	3122740	the the a sunset in particular
3123460	3125780	evokes a certain emotional response
3127700	3132740	That like fosters cohesion and stuff it like puts you in like a like a meta like a relaxed state of peace
3133300	3138020	And it's a you know, you can be a reductivist and say visual stimuli emotional states
3138980	3140100	and
3140100	3142580	So the aesthetic is a serving a very functional purpose
3143540	3147220	but I kind of turn around the head where it's like it's not like
3147940	3149940	it's not like
3149940	3155460	The aesthetic is still fundamental where it's like this emotional response is not just like oh, it's just for survival
3155460	3156980	it's like no, no, no, it's
3156980	3160420	It's it's putting yourself in contact with the metaphysical
3160980	3163540	foundation of reality, right? What is that sunset?
3164980	3166980	Represent or what is that sunset?
3167380	3169140	you know, I'm and I'm
3169140	3170420	thinking I'm
3170420	3175380	Falling apart here because it gets so complicated. I mean, yeah, but but but but
3175620	3177620	But
3179060	3184660	For me because of I feel like I've always been more on the how does this relate to the thing in front?
3186660	3188660	I hated philosophy
3189780	3191780	Up until about
3192180	3196740	Freshman sophomore year of college in part because I had friends who studied philosophy
3197220	3202820	Who were just intellectual masturbators who would just string together those? I told you well, no, you're not because you know
3203540	3208340	Well, at least at least you're not to the degree that okay, okay some of them were because
3210340	3212340	It was it was literally like
3212340	3213700	um
3213700	3214900	poetry
3214900	3220420	Where I would say something like what is it to be in relationship to the object of our desire and that
3220820	3223300	the metaphysical reality of this that and it was like
3224260	3226900	It wasn't that you were saying anything. It was the
3227860	3233300	It was the act of putting together these complicated words in with some rhythm and some poet and like, you know
3233300	3236020	And that can be interesting from like a you know
3236740	3238980	Poetry without explicitly saying anything is still interesting
3239380	3245860	But that's all that's all that it was like it wasn't helpful like like philosophy wasn't when I first encountered it in the way that I encountered it
3245860	3247700	It wasn't being used
3247700	3254100	To elucidate anything. It wasn't being used to improve your life. It was just hear all these abstract concepts
3254100	3255860	I remember saying to my friend like
3255860	3260020	It is such a privileged arrogant thing to be able to sit back and say
3260500	3266100	What is the relationship between me and my consciousness and the objects around me? It's like dude, there are people starving
3266340	3268820	There's the shit we have to do this is a waste of time
3269540	3271540	and and now
3272420	3276340	The reason I'm interested in philosophy is because in order to be able to to do those things
3276820	3279140	You know people are starving. Let's go address that there's shit to do
3279700	3283140	You have to like you have to get to you have to do philosophy to
3284100	3286580	Put yourself in the best position to be able to solve problems
3286980	3288980	So that's where I'm coming from
3288980	3292100	And you you know, it's a blend of both but it sounds like you
3292660	3296340	Maybe are also on the like there's just something about the aesthetics of it
3297460	3302740	Of you know being like being with a capital B. I remember first understanding that phrase was like oh, that's cool
3302820	3304740	like you know independent of
3304740	3308900	This didn't help me solve a problem or anything but like oh oh being with a capital B is
3309860	3315220	Read there's reality as it manifests in front of me, but then there's reality as I experience it and there's
3315780	3317940	you know, that that's an important distinction, but like
3319460	3322740	Some there's something about that distinction that speaks to you that that's aesthetic
3322820	3325540	I guess to some degree and so I value that as as well, but
3326980	3329460	Yeah, because you know in a way Paul and
3330580	3334820	Forgive me if this comes to the wrong way. You're kind of trying to do an impossible thing
3335540	3340820	Because it could be unfair to say or all you like if if if someone says
3341220	3345300	Pf young your channel is a self-help channel. I mean, that's besides not a self-help channel
3345300	3350260	No, it's not just because you you talk about you in fact do talk about metaphysics and theory
3350260	3355060	You talk about archetype psychology all of that and that is very much I believe
3355620	3359540	Grounded in your aesthetic appreciation of these concepts
3360180	3365540	Though yes, you also try and build a bridge. I don't know if that's a proper word, but you try and
3366100	3367700	See how that can
3367700	3369780	Have a material impact on the world
3370500	3374420	Um, and I think all philosophers do that for instance again one of my my hero Gizek
3374820	3377140	He'll take Hegel's metaphysics or
3377860	3381460	Or Hegel's lack of metaphysics different conversation and then Lacan's
3382020	3384180	you know psychoanalysis and then he
3384980	3391540	Takes a Marxist perspective and he connects them and he he finds a synthesis into the real world where there's political action and whatnot
3392100	3393140	so
3393140	3395140	And and that's that's where
3395140	3402100	Maybe now we could connect this back to the the fascism bit where I kind of want to maybe I want to make it like an episode in this
3402180	3404180	in this uh conversation so that I can
3404660	3405780	kind of
3405780	3409140	You know, uh have it as like one one flow. Let's say
3409620	3410980	um
3411060	3414420	It's that so Gizek was asked in one interview
3415060	3417060	What's the purpose of philosophy?
3417140	3420580	and he said oh, it's a difficult question to answer but but
3421620	3423620	generally
3423620	3429540	philosophy comes to salience in times of crisis because philosophy isn't about giving solutions
3430020	3431380	It's in fact
3431380	3438100	Learning even how to formulate the questions. It's not even about giving the answers. It's about it's about figuring out figuring out
3438580	3440580	What questions to ask in the first place?
3440900	3446180	That's I like that, you know, and I I certainly at a very pragmatic level. I agree with him there
3446260	3448260	I I think philosophy isn't even about
3448660	3454500	Going and finding solutions that can be done in different disciplines like like science of course or economics
3454740	3460500	There are many other disciplines where we could focus on on on solutions on palpable material solutions
3461380	3465940	But that is on philosophy, you know, and I think philosophy is the questions, which is why
3466900	3469140	Perhaps we could connect that to the uh
3470260	3472260	the fascism part where
3472820	3474820	okay, so
3476180	3480500	There are there are two two thinkers here. There's there's hannah arwin and then there's uh,
3481300	3486500	I keep forgetting the guy's name um burto echo and burto echo his list so
3488660	3494580	When when wash wash colds, uh pizza fascist, uh, here he is
3495940	3501380	Is it okay if you go there now to to like kind of? Yeah. Yeah a bit. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so just for the vivas
3501460	3504180	I'll put up the list on the screen. Uh, but
3504660	3508340	I'll I'll first read it out. Um, you could even if you it's up to you
3508420	3513940	You could share it with me now. So we're both looking at it. But that's the right. Yeah, but you know, if you don't want to have us be minimized
3514180	3520100	It's not that's the right idea. Uh, we can both then refer to the same point that could work the problem with being a nerd is man
3520100	3522100	I've got multiple screens and
3522820	3524020	I
3524020	3528420	Yeah, I'm doing like a bath the app spot. Yeah, so let me zoom in
3529220	3533060	So this is from open culture. I just found this list, but you could find it like on Wikipedia wherever
3533540	3534740	um
3534740	3538580	And we could probably discuss this and then if if it's okay with you
3538660	3543140	There's also a small excerpt from hannah arwin's book that I'd like to read out
3543300	3549940	Yeah, so this is the list in fact that borsch was referring to and I think this is a pretty good list to define a fascist from a
3550260	3551620	theoretical perspective
3552420	3556180	So, uh, there are 14 points here. Uh, I'm just going to firstly
3556740	3557780	Go through
3557780	3559780	Read out all 14. Uh
3559780	3562900	The cult of tradition the rejection of modernism
3563620	3566900	Modernism, sorry the cut of action for action's sake
3568100	3570100	Disagreement in treason
3570500	3572260	fear of difference
3572260	3574260	Appeal to social frustration
3574900	3576900	The obsession with the plot
3577380	3579780	The enemy is both strong and weak
3580500	3582820	pacifism is trafficking with the enemy
3583540	3585540	contempt for the weak
3585700	3588340	Everybody is educated to become a hero
3589060	3590420	uh
3590420	3591700	What's that word?
3591700	3593700	machismo machismo and weaponry
3594100	3594980	uh
3594980	3596980	selective populism
3597460	3600980	Irv fascism speaks new speak. So it's like an o'whalien thing new speak
3602180	3607060	So firstly paul, let me just ask you up front from this these 14 points
3608020	3612660	If you were to give the devil his deal, let's say in this case the devil is borsch
3613620	3615700	borsch, uh
3615700	3620980	Would you say is that is that a connection you can make to to any of peterson's work?
3620980	3624340	His persona even his twitter whatever he does publicly
3624980	3626980	From these 14 points
3628260	3631060	Yes, so I was I was looking over this, um
3632340	3636820	Prior to this conversation and what stood out to me is
3637060	3639060	A
3639380	3641380	Lot of these points
3641620	3644740	Are not just the descriptions of fascism, but the description of
3645700	3648580	tyranny in general or authoritarianism, right?
3649220	3651220	Now it's funny because
3652020	3655540	Uh, I think vosh has claimed like Stalin was a fascist
3657140	3664260	Right, so that to to my point it's like everyone who's a thought my own Stalin nazis
3664980	3666660	fascism
3666740	3671940	What we normally think of is like kind of, you know, the nazis equal fascist fascist is like a right-wing thing
3672340	3674340	and i'm pretty sure there's a lot of
3674580	3677860	Thinkers that would say that fascism is a right-wing phenomenon
3678340	3684340	Um, I think marcus. That's like his central idea his list. Yes a dono's list. Yeah, it's a right-wing phenomenon
3684420	3686420	Yeah, yeah, it's inherently right-wing
3686500	3691460	Um, which means Stalin was right-wing even though he called himself a communist so we get we immediately get into the realm of
3691700	3699380	Depending on how you define fact if fascism just means like you said ccp is fascist. It's like well, they're communist
3699620	3700580	but
3700580	3703140	I get your point if if we're going to define fascism in the way
3703940	3705940	Yeah
3706340	3708340	Yeah, so, um
3709860	3711860	Like cult of tradition
3711940	3716660	One only has to look at the syllabus of every fascist move to find major traditionalist thinkers
3717140	3721700	The nazi nazis was nourished by traditionalist syncretasist the cult elements
3722900	3724420	so
3724420	3726020	It's kind of like a matter of interpretation
3726100	3730980	And so is anyone who appreciates tradition at risk of are they somewhat fascist?
3731060	3736740	So if I if I have a minor appreciation for tradition if I get married and my wife takes my last name
3737380	3739380	For no other reason than its tradition
3740020	3742420	Is that am I semi-fascist in that regard?
3743220	3744820	Uh
3744820	3751300	I hope you know, well, I hope that's not well. I don't know if that's what vosh was say given that we're talking about
3751940	3754900	You know his because he brought up the the the
3755460	3759220	It's the reason we're having this conversation is because of him. So I'm going to refer to him. Yeah, but a lot
3760260	3767780	But well, here's where I I think of peterson as falling into some maybe let's take the color tradition, right? So
3770260	3772260	Partially from my understanding
3772980	3774980	I haven't got much of an understanding
3776020	3778500	Or like the details of this list by umberto echo
3778900	3782580	But hannah aaron certainly talks about this color tradition idea where she says
3783300	3785300	so, you know, uh
3785780	3787780	peterson says
3787780	3791460	The the west is in crisis from the postmodern new maxis. So
3792020	3796740	Or from these radical leftists or from woke people the west is in crisis
3797300	3801300	Where we are going through a downfall in our civilization
3802340	3803300	and
3803300	3804980	and the idea is
3804980	3807220	the the color tradition the way I read it is that
3808180	3810820	we have all these crazy people that are
3811860	3813860	creating havoc and chaos in society
3814180	3819460	We need to go back to something of more more ordered something more of a conservative
3820100	3822820	Way where there was hierarchy and structure where
3823300	3828740	Men knew men knew what men were women knew what women were everybody had a place a role and for me
3828740	3832740	That's fascist when the moment we start prescribing on how
3833460	3836020	individuals should should fit into
3836820	3838820	a certain
3838900	3844260	Let's say we prescribe how people should live their lives within broader society and we we say
3844740	3848100	Uh, you have a place. So, you know, it's it's funny. Uh
3849780	3855780	Nature who's a proto postmodernist in fact believed in hierarchy. He said that everybody has a place
3855860	3862980	There are the the masters and slaves. There are some people remember that yeah, we're much exactly some people fit in the hierarchy
3863780	3868180	And and which the irony there is of course that uh, he was a
3868740	3874820	Postmodernist they didn't believe in any any objective morality. Not none of that. He he didn't even he believed that we should reject
3875700	3883380	Tradition but he called Christianity slave morality. Exactly. And he he said he believes that Christianity was the worst thing that happened to the west
3883780	3886740	Which I women to disagree with him on but
3887220	3889220	Anyway, sorry, I'm going all over the place here
3889620	3894180	The idea of for me the cut of tradition is where to put it very very plainly
3894740	3897460	When people say all the good old days the good old days where
3898340	3903620	You know, where you know, where there was monogamy where there was, you know, men and women got married where you know
3904020	3907540	People all over the church, uh, everybody knew their place in society
3907700	3912100	But now we live in this chaotic times. Firstly, I don't think the good old days existed ever
3912100	3915620	There has never been the good old days in my opinion. I think in in some sense
3915620	3920260	I'm here very much as Jackie and where the only universalist is conflict
3921540	3924500	Society is forever going through this antagonism. Let's say
3925140	3926820	uh, but when
3926820	3932820	Yeah, when Peterson does those kinds of prescriptions, I do think I'm not gonna that's for me. That's not fascism
3932820	3936900	But I think there are elements of fascism that can come through him saying
3937540	3939540	People should find their place in society
3940180	3944660	If that makes well, so okay, so that we can have a whole interesting conversation on that point, I think because
3946340	3947460	I
3947460	3949460	so
3950340	3955780	I'm not sure what the difference between you said like you said prescribing people
3957460	3962100	Prescribing, you know, what people how people should live their life in a social hierarchy, correct
3964340	3968820	Yeah, perhaps we're describing their place in that society. Yeah, that's probably a bit of if putting
3968900	3975380	So, okay, so let me complicate that because I would say for example children obey their parents. Is that fascistic?
3976020	3978020	Well, to a certain extent, I would say yes
3978340	3984020	I mean, this is where this is where things get a bit iffy and you know, we go on the nerd theory shit
3984500	3986900	Right, which is fine. I'm had let's we're here for that. This is not
3987460	3992660	Because this is like 200,000 people will not see this. So, you know, it's not about appealing to the masses
3992660	3997700	It's about not at all man. Like I just want to purely speak about theory today if you don't mind and I know you
3997700	4003380	Well, so I don't I don't feel guilty for doing so. No, totally. Totally. Okay. So to that point to that point
4004180	4009220	You know children obey their parents is you know, it's it's it's at least in this regard. There's some element of
4010100	4012100	fascist fascism to it
4012420	4014420	and it's like, okay
4014580	4016180	then
4016180	4018180	This is where
4018260	4023060	This is where, you know, equivocation aside because we're not having a debate and it's not too a thing
4024820	4026820	Then fascism isn't a bad thing
4027700	4029700	if that's the case
4029780	4032020	or at least like or at least
4033380	4039300	The lack of fascism is a bad thing because if if if children should obey their parents
4040180	4041940	is
4041940	4047300	Fascistic like there's no society that's ever existed that isn't at least somewhat fascistic because every society
4047620	4050900	children obey their parents, you know, it differs what age and all that stuff, but
4052820	4056100	And in christianity too, right christianity is like there's a whole honor your mother and father
4056420	4061620	Yeah, submission is a big part of christianity. Yes. Yeah. So I guess how do you think about like
4062260	4064740	Do you think fascist fascism is bad?
4065700	4069060	And that's just so this that's too simple the question obviously, but I guess
4070500	4072500	Even if we're just talking about intellectually
4073780	4076420	You know as fascism purely descriptive or or is there some
4077700	4081860	You know, it's it's there's an implication that it's a negative thing, right? That's that's a good point
4081940	4088980	I would say intellectually and here's where I'm very much going back into philosophy. It is purely descriptive
4089620	4094420	Whereas the prescriptive element. Okay. I would say okay. Hannah Arendt's different. She certainly
4094900	4100900	Makes moral claims in the book like in in origins of totalitarianism. She certainly makes moral claims and
4101620	4106180	and for good reason given that she was a jew in germany and she
4107220	4108740	was exiled
4108740	4115300	When the nazis came into power. So she has a she has a right to make moral claims, but as as
4115780	4117780	at an intellectual level, I would say
4119460	4124500	It has that kind of here's where I think the descriptive element matters because
4125620	4132340	Uh, the descriptor a list like this theory, let's say is in some sense the canary in the coal mine
4132660	4137940	It's an harbinger of what's to come. It's a it's a way of of analyzing and making sense of reality
4138900	4142260	via a a theoretical framework therefore
4143140	4144740	you know, if if
4144740	4150900	For example, if I say yes, you know, forcing children to listen to their parents even though
4151300	4154580	Look, I'm not a I'm not a father yet. I'd like to be one
4155300	4161300	I would certainly warn my kids to to listen to me to a certain extent, you know, not all that much, but sure
4161700	4163700	Definitely not completely. Yeah, if there's
4164660	4168660	That's bad. Yeah, yeah, because then it then it, you know, they kind of become like
4169700	4171700	Cox
4171780	4173780	to you the technical tell
4173940	4176100	Yes, the technical to the theory
4176980	4182500	You got to be able to sometimes break the rules a little bit. Uh, uh, yeah. Yeah, and and I don't know so
4183780	4186820	If I could connect this to something a bit more tangible, let's say we're we're getting
4187540	4191300	Way way too abstract here and I apologize. It's my nature. I can't help myself
4192260	4196100	You know, Peterson always talks about cleaning your room, you know, personal responsibility
4196660	4203380	Look, look, look what burdens of the world you want to take upon and and live in life and and so it's it's it seems as if
4204180	4206100	It seems as if from his
4206100	4208100	rhetoric there's very little
4209220	4210740	uh
4210740	4213060	Let's say dialogue a conversation about in fact
4213700	4219380	No, not focusing on myself not focusing on on what I can do within the structure of society
4219540	4225940	But what about changing the structure of society itself? What about challenging these hierarchies itself?
4226260	4233300	Because for me, that's essentially what leftism is left leftism is it's it's quite simple. It's it's simply wanting to
4233940	4235220	uh
4235220	4237220	To challenge the existing
4237620	4244180	Social hierarchies or to a certain extent abolishing them even though that's perhaps an impossible impossibility
4244420	4250260	Yes, I would say likely an impossibility. Yeah, nonetheless. It's it's still challenge. It's this constant challenge of existing
4250660	4252660	structures and social hierarchies
4252820	4258420	Yeah, making hierarchies more equal or stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
4259460	4261460	So, okay on that point in particular
4263460	4265460	Well, first off, I would say
4266260	4267300	Uh
4267300	4269940	A thorough reading of Peterson. I don't I think would
4271140	4272980	What's the word?
4272980	4276020	I think would absolve not absolve. I think would
4277060	4280900	Banish that idea that you just put forward from your head. Sure because one
4282180	4286260	Yeah, yeah, it's a peter sony and meme almost where his phrase is
4286900	4291300	You need to do what's good for you. What's good for your family? What's good for the society?
4291300	4295220	What's good for your community? What's good for society, right? That's that's the p. That's the
4296020	4298900	I believe that's the highest form of piagetian
4299780	4300900	Moral
4300900	4302660	It's a character. Oh
4302660	4304660	no, no, no
4305220	4307220	Piaget is concerned with moral development, right?
4307220	4312100	Like first you play first you can like play play with another child without having explicit rules
4312500	4314500	Then you can play a game with explicit rules
4315140	4322660	And then the final stage the highest order of moral development for human beings is being able to generate new rules to new games
4323940	4325940	and another that's
4326900	4328900	The a consequence of that is
4330660	4333940	Human beings can act in ways that are good for themselves
4334820	4336820	and also good for their families
4337620	4341380	And also good for their communities and also and it just expands, right?
4341700	4348340	There's and and the the fundamental peter sony and claim is like your brain is wired to tell you when you're doing that
4348340	4352820	when you are most deeply meaningfully engaged with something whether it's pursuing art or
4353540	4358180	You know creating some code that's useful or doing whatever when you're develop when you're developing yourself to the point
4358180	4362740	Where you can become the kind of person that's as good for yourself and society as you can be
4363540	4368580	You're adapted to that and so the whole idea of like hey the reason that you pursue
4369620	4371620	personal responsibility the reason that you clean your room
4372100	4377460	Is so that you put yourself in the position to be able to make those broad social changes, right?
4377460	4381140	because you need politicians you need people that do that, you know
4381780	4382820	that
4382820	4384820	you know, like he's a fan of Tolstoy and
4385380	4387700	Martin Luther King and Gandhi and all that, right? It's like
4388820	4392020	That was clearly all social action. You know collective action
4392740	4396180	And again, and this is funny your point about centrism. I don't know if we'll uh
4397060	4401700	Time to go over, you know, we could we I'm more than happy to do a separate thing just on centrism. That would be really interesting
4401860	4403860	Yeah, I mean, I have
4404100	4407620	Theoretical reasons as to why I sure sure I'm as impossible, uh, but
4407780	4414420	Nonetheless, sorry to interrupt sure. Well, just to preview what my at least argument would be or my perspective is is that
4415620	4418580	The best elements of leftism and the best elements of conservatism
4419220	4424420	Are encapsulated in centrism and it's just a matter of adapting to the circumstance. So for example leftism as you said
4424420	4425780	it's about
4425780	4428900	equalizing hierarchies and addressing corrupt social structures. It's like
4430260	4436580	There you and Peterson's whole point is the whole reason there are people with personalities that we would describe as liberal
4436660	4438660	Is because that's a necessary function
4438980	4444980	You need people who can who when society is getting corrupt, which it always does because it always leads towards corruption
4445540	4452260	And and the world is constantly changing new technology is created and the laws that you had in the past aren't going to apply
4452900	4458340	Like, you know with like ai for example, we that clearly needs to be regulated, right or or anything the internet, you know
4460260	4465700	Like free speech like, you know, we still don't allow child abuse to be videotaped and distributed
4465700	4471860	Like that's not even a remotely contentious philosophical. Well for some people it might be a remotely just philosophically contentious at you
4471860	4474580	but for most people it's not and rightfully so and so
4475540	4481700	Um, why did I even bring that up? So so you need people on the on the left who can say hey
4482500	4489860	These these traditions and these rules if they can't just be they have to be interpreted to the modern environment that we're in
4490340	4493220	And the the process of that interpretation is inherently left-wing
4493620	4495620	Well, well there
4496820	4502020	Right and then the conservative flip side would be like hey, I know that you guys want to change all this shit
4502420	4506660	But we've been doing this shit for 2000 years and it turns out that all of these changes
4507700	4512900	um didn't consider why we were doing things for 2000 years to begin with right like
4513460	4518260	um a good example is like this like the sexual revolution, you know, the
4518740	4523700	You know in the victorian times people were super prude and repressor sexual. Well, you know, it was clearly unhealthy
4524260	4529380	Okay, so what was the flip side of that the sexual revolution the 60s and all that well, okay
4530340	4536500	You know, there's clear benefits to that people are freer and you know, it's not constrictive and you know people can in principle
4537540	4541140	You know get compatibility with partners before they get married and stuff. There's all kinds of good reasons
4541220	4542900	I think you can make
4542900	4547060	But what's the flip side of that? Well, you know how much sexual assault occurred at woodstock
4547060	4551940	You know how much sexual assault occurred in the sexual liberation where oh, we were just we're just liberated. It's like
4552820	4557140	Consent was not nearly as emphasized during the sexual revolution and it's funny because
4557780	4560500	the current sort of left-wing perspective on
4561380	4563380	Uh like consent and all that
4563540	4567540	It's sort of doubling back to the conservative part where it's like you need you need, you know, it's very
4568340	4572980	You know no room for or you know, what is it? Uh for messing around you need you need
4573940	4578340	You know strict verbal consent on every every move you make yeah, it's it's pathetic
4579140	4582420	I mean, I mean anyone who's been with uh, well because I'm straight. I'm gonna be with a woman
4583380	4587060	I don't think anyone's gonna go and be like before you make out with the girl. Hey, could you sign this specific?
4587380	4593780	Yeah, exactly. Well, dude, there's black. There's black mirror episode about like someone like can you sign off all the consent forms of
4593780	4597540	All the things we're about to do whatever it's like something that'd be great sex, right? Yeah, imagine that. Yeah, exactly
4597620	4600580	Yeah, that's all the that's all the mystery. Yeah, that's a foreplay
4600820	4602820	Risk
4603780	4605780	So so the whole point of that is to say
4606820	4609380	The left is needed half the time or
4610260	4613460	For half of the problems and the conservatives are needed for the other half of the problems
4613860	4617220	And you have to adjudicate between both because the environment is shifting around you
4618020	4619620	and so
4619620	4625300	I I'm not I don't buy the idea that peterson is an anti leftist in its most positive form
4625300	4632100	He's obviously anti extreme leftist just as he is extreme against extreme right wing to tell terrarism, right? I mean, he's whole
4633460	4636580	analysis of Nazi Germany and his old thesis is like
4637540	4641700	This shit was bad and I'm trying to you know get everyone to understand how bad it was and how
4642500	4649220	You could have easily played a part in bringing about that terrible situation and why it's important to understand that so that we don't bring that about
4650020	4655220	Yeah, okay. So here's here's a follow-up question. Um, I I think I
4655460	4660020	Mostly agree with what you said, but then and forgive me for name dropping
4660020	4663860	But I've got to do this because I'm a nerd. Uh, so, you know, if you ask someone like
4665060	4667540	Like uh, like data, let's say uh
4669140	4673540	What do you mean by okay, you ask from them, uh, it is truth objective
4674340	4678420	Perhaps what data would say is, you know, we got a question the question itself
4678660	4682740	He'll speak about the episteme where can we even to even have that question
4682900	4687300	What structures do we have to ask that question? Like that's how dirty. Yeah, which is funny
4688100	4693300	The question the question exactly. Yeah, there's a clip of Peterson doing that exact thing where it's like, well, what do you mean by god?
4693540	4696100	What do you mean by you? What do you mean by god?
4696180	4700180	So that's funny because it's it's he does the same thing in some and I think it's you know, you know
4700260	4705380	In a certain to a certain extent, I like that Peterson does that. Yeah. Well, I don't know what I mean if the devil is do
4705940	4710100	Yeah, of course. Yeah, what yeah, yeah, who knows what what do you mean by god? It's it's difficult
4710500	4713220	It's it's perhaps the question what right?
4713780	4714820	so
4714820	4716820	the the way I would
4716900	4720100	connect that to this first point the cut of tradition is
4721220	4725220	So you said there are there are there are people in the left people people in the right
4725460	4730580	and we're trying to find the best of both worlds and kind of create this kind of synthesis
4731220	4733060	um, and
4733060	4736500	And then maybe come to a higher truth or a better way of life something
4737380	4741780	Beyond something. Yeah, let's even say morally better than what we have right now
4742820	4744100	but
4744100	4745300	what if
4745300	4750580	There can't be a synthesis. What if in fact there is this inherent conflict
4751140	4756980	Um between what right wing people believe or left left wing people believe so kissing point is
4757620	4761940	to connect it to the gender issue, uh, which you and wash went into deeply
4762580	4763700	what if
4763700	4765380	fundamentally
4765380	4770740	The people in the left or or people let's say in the in the in the far left or the walk moment
4771620	4774820	Had a different idea of what gender is to
4775460	4780420	Conservatives like a person. I'm sorry to say this but I I'm gonna say I fucking hate matt walsh
4781140	4786180	Uh, he he really just angered me. He's a fascist. He's someone that I would describe as fascistic
4786260	4790180	I mean, you saw his proto fascist about killing drug drug dealers
4790500	4798580	He he tweeted beautiful airport in singapore and he was like we would have an airport like this if we kill people who smoke weed or something
4799220	4800500	so, uh
4800500	4805700	Yeah, I think like for example, he would easily fit into most points on this list easily
4805860	4810820	We wouldn't even even have to have this conversation calls himself a fascist democratic fascist. So yeah, exactly
4810900	4815220	And it's like ha ha it's a joke. It's like, yeah. Well root of all jokes. Yeah. I mean, correct
4815300	4818020	Right. I mean, he's got a million followers. I don't think you know
4818180	4822180	I disagree with that kind of cynical thing where people say, oh, everything's a joke. No, man
4822260	4828980	Sometimes the things you say recently. I don't know if you were familiar this. Uh, oh wash in fact covered this but that's 16 year old
4829620	4835060	Uh transgender girl. She was she was murdered in high school. Yeah, Brianna in England, right in england
4835060	4838500	I mean, so no no no sometimes not everything is a joke and sometimes
4839220	4846660	You what you're trying to do is very much warranted and needed where yeah, you do try to take these theoretical concepts and
4847300	4853540	Connect them to real life because there are real material impacts. Sorry. I'm going off on a tangent here. No, no
4853700	4859700	What I'm trying to make is so my question is what if there is that inherent conflict? What what do we do there?
4862180	4863700	Well, we for well fair enough
4863780	4870260	I think I'd say we first identify is that conflict because it's inherent or is the conflict because of breakdown of communication
4870660	4872660	So like you gave the example of
4872740	4873860	Well, go ahead
4873860	4879300	Well, no, I would I would say at a very conceptual level. It is just fundamentally inherent. So, uh,
4880100	4884100	I mean communication is a complicated topic. But like for for example, if
4884820	4887780	a, uh, let's say a leftist believes that
4888820	4893940	Gender is a a social phenomena. So, you know, speaking about people like Judith Butler
4894020	4901220	It's it's performativity where where what gender is is a performance or it's it's how we view ourselves in the
4901940	4906340	Gaze or the perspective of the other that society let's say for all the innocent purposes
4906340	4912420	Whereas a person on the right would say no gender is it's it's rooted in something more innate objective
4913300	4920260	Be it biology or be it our hierarchies or be it our traditions gender isn't something that's malleable. It is something
4920820	4926420	Uh, well, you don't even have to say have to say binary, but it is something that you just can't decide for yourself
4927140	4930900	How do we find a how do we reconcile these almost
4931620	4933780	irreconcilable, uh
4933860	4936500	Assertions or proclamations. Yeah, well
4939780	4942580	So my perspective is there's four
4943460	4948180	There are four different perspectives on every single issue every single contention. There's four different perspectives. Yeah
4949860	4951860	There's the far right
4952340	4957940	Which is incorrect the far left perspective, which is incorrect. Then there's the reasonable left and the reasonable right perspective
4960420	4962420	So like
4962660	4964660	As a side example like abortion
4965060	4970100	The far right perspective is the moment of sperm fertilized an egg. That's a human being that's wrong. I don't that does make any sense to me
4970100	4972500	That's unintuitive. It's it's a silly position
4973060	4977060	The far left position is we can abort a child even after it's born. Okay, so those are the two extremes
4977620	4983060	I think yeah, yeah, so the what's what's the what's the correct left wing perspective?
4983780	4984500	um
4984500	4988980	The moment a sperm fertilized an egg. It's not a human being at some point it does become a human being
4989780	4991780	but
4992260	4994260	We have to allow abortion prior to
4994660	4998740	Some for some time after the sperm being fertilized or the egg being fertilized, right?
4998740	5002100	So there's some perspective where abortion should be allowed. That's a reasonable left wing perspective
5002660	5007700	The reasonable right wing perspective is at some point that sperm that fertilized egg does become a human being
5008180	5014740	And we need to not allow abortion for that. So the the there's two far extremes far right far left
5015780	5020260	Those are wrong and then and then the middle left and the middle right gets synthesized
5020900	5027620	So I that's like a and that's just one example. I believe that I believe you can take that approach on every single issue immigration abortion
5028420	5030420	and you can even in a weird way to
5030500	5036020	You know break it down to like if you have a personal disagreement with someone like if you're in a relationship and there's some argument
5036660	5038660	You can use that map
5039460	5042500	In the same way it obviously doesn't apply because it's not like a political ideology
5042500	5048660	But every belief there's too far of one, you know, it's like the golden middle, right? Aristotelian mean, is that what it is?
5049140	5051140	right, there's always little way
5052020	5053380	to evaluate
5053380	5055380	Any moral issue, right?
5056100	5062180	So I don't actually so the the you're you're put you're saying if it was the case that there's a fundamental
5062500	5064500	irreconcilable difference
5064660	5066660	between
5066740	5071460	Broadly the left or the right on a particular issue. How do we go about doing that? I would challenge
5071460	5075220	I would say I don't believe reality is set up such that that actually exists
5075700	5083780	I believe that so we have multiple differences. Okay. Yes. I don't think I think I think to the degree that something appears to be an irreconcilable difference
5083860	5085300	and it's like
5085380	5087380	you know to your point like to your credit like
5088580	5094660	We are in a very polarized state right now, which would very easily lead everyone to believe of course, there's irreconcilable differences. Duh
5095380	5102100	But I would say that fundamentally I think is a breakdown of communication and the gender example. I think is a good example because
5102740	5104340	like
5104340	5105940	gender and sex
5105940	5106740	I
5106740	5111700	Conceptualize is different gender is socially constructed and sex is biological male female and then masculine
5112340	5115780	and feminine now man and woman is just whatever dude if
5116980	5122100	Sometimes I'll refer to it biologically and if I'm talking to a trans person. Maybe I'll you know refer to them as whatever
5122260	5124980	it's just it's it's it's that's not a big enough deal
5125780	5127380	to
5127380	5129060	to
5129060	5131860	To die on a hill of how many use the words in this way
5132260	5137780	But certainly masculine feminine socially constructed spectrum male and female is a binary there's intersex, but
5138500	5140500	for all intents and purposes, it's a binary, right?
5141700	5144500	So the irreconcilable difference I think is if is just a
5145300	5149140	If we could get all the conservatives to agree like hey, you know how like
5150100	5152100	Chuck Norris is a man
5152260	5153780	and
5153780	5154900	uh
5154900	5161540	You know, who's a fucking super skinny kind of you know, you know how uh, Mick Jagger is a man, you know how like
5162500	5167220	Yeah, yeah, you know how like they're both men, but Mick Jagger is a little bit, you know more kind of flamboyant and
5167540	5172420	Feminine yeah, and Chuck Norris is like, you know, this kind of classic masculine type whatever
5172820	5177380	We can recognize that there's a there's a spectrum in there, right? And it's and it's influenced by you know
5177380	5179380	How they're raised and their culture and all that okay
5180420	5184340	Boom masculinity and gender is a social construct, right? Okay
5185220	5187460	Sex is so that we're not the concerned
5188100	5191380	This the centrist's job is to get conservatives to recognize that
5191940	5193940	okay, and then
5194100	5200580	To the leftists or the far left or whatever so hey male and female. There's some variation, but like
5201860	5203380	every
5203380	5205380	possible
5205780	5210740	Male and female are fundamental biological categories that that are older than
5212020	5213620	uh
5213620	5220180	You know like billion, you know billions hundreds of millions of years old like plants have gametes, right?
5220180	5223940	Plants have pollen and other like male and female are fundamental categories
5224420	5229140	And there's a lot of differences between males and females that are clearly biological and not socially constructed
5229700	5230820	and
5230820	5236420	Our socially constructed roles do have some correlate like masculinity correlates to maleness
5237300	5239300	right like a like, you know
5239780	5241780	Why are what you know if we're talking about gender roles?
5241860	5246340	Why are most of the physical labor jobs all met? Well because males on average are stronger
5246740	5251940	So the social so the socialized role of masculine being physical labor physical
5252500	5255300	Clearly has something to do with being male, but there's women who are strong as well
5256100	5259300	So there's no reason to have that social distinction be binary
5260980	5264420	Even though the underlying biology that the social distinctions related to is binary, right?
5264420	5270100	There's there's room to expand things and also with technology we decouple social roles from biology
5270420	5273060	So like as a male I I've I've never hunted
5273700	5278180	Right, and if the world all actually went out tomorrow, I would starve. I am not
5278980	5280980	I'm not
5281780	5286340	What would you say the male the traditional male role of like hunting all that shit
5286340	5291540	It is not it's not something I engage in because technology has decoupled the need for me to be a hunter
5293060	5297220	Versus I can go to the grocery store and I can you know do other things right so like
5298100	5299380	clearly
5299380	5303380	There's a social aspect and the more technology we have and the more society changes the more we can
5304340	5310580	Differentiate the gender role from the underlying biology right like the birth control pill, right like you know women
5311620	5313860	It would be much more difficult for women to
5314580	5316580	travel the world in the ancient times
5317380	5322340	Because you know there was no birth control and no tampons and no any and like you know any of that stuff and it's like
5322980	5326100	I'm not a woman, but I bet if I asked most most women
5326100	5330180	Hey, if all tampons and birth control and all of that went away tomorrow
5330580	5333220	Would that make your life more difficult in virtually every way?
5334180	5336180	Yes, it would and so
5336500	5340100	You know you just think like that's that was the norm for 2000 years and
5340900	5343220	You know, maybe it's like okay. That's why
5344260	5348980	Women weren't you know for we're not leading armies as often aside from not being able to fight
5349060	5350340	but it's like
5350340	5353620	You're just weighed down by this biological burden that women have that
5354100	5358500	Technology has been able to alleviate in a lot of ways. So anyway, that's a whole roundabout way of saying
5359060	5363540	I don't believe that was one example of where I don't think there isn't a reconcilable difference and I
5364260	5366260	ontologically disagree that
5366260	5368260	there are such things as
5368420	5370420	irreconcilable
5371460	5373060	Um
5373060	5377620	Positions now there are people who are erect like there are people who are so far gone on either side
5378340	5383540	That they're that they are irreconcilable and also like psychopathy exists. Yeah. Um, we're talking about
5384100	5386100	Yeah, we're talking at a yeah, I see that yeah
5386180	5391060	I think you know, this is why because like for me ontologically I'm completely in the opposite side where I think
5391940	5393220	essentially
5393220	5395220	Reality is a conflict
5395700	5398500	You know, and this is where I'm even a christian here where
5399220	5402340	There's a brokenness of reality. It's as if something
5403380	5405380	went terribly wrong
5405700	5411540	You know in christian I would call it the fall but there is so for me, which is why I think in fact
5413380	5414980	There's a lecanian point
5414980	5417380	Truth is found in the conflict itself
5417940	5420420	And I don't think the conflict is ever reconciled
5420900	5424580	Which is why here's where I'm sure you'd agree agree with me on this
5424980	5428100	I'm a strong believer in dialogue
5428740	5434980	And conversation even if conversation can be heated and it can get ugly. I still believe we ought to
5435620	5439060	Converse at all times and I'm a free speech absolute absolutist
5439620	5441220	um, so
5441220	5444180	So, okay, uh, I think we kind of touched on the point a
5444900	5449060	A lot more than we should have but I I see that I see that um, yeah, here's here's the other thing
5449060	5453140	I was thinking let's probably go if you don't mind pull to point number five
5454020	5461860	Sure feel of difference the first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movements is an appeal against the intruders
5462580	5467460	Toss or fascism is racist by definition. I believe that's how you pronounce
5471780	5473780	So this is again
5473860	5478900	It's I don't I don't mean to connect everything to the trans issue, but I feel like it's something that's just
5479620	5482980	Yeah, it's a cultural touch point. It's a cultural touch point and into that
5483380	5487780	Therefore, it's just that kind of easy thing to point to there. Suddenly. I you know is
5488500	5490500	society is fundamentally
5490660	5499060	Currently in a point of change. We have all these new ways of being we have new ways of people expressing their their gender their sexuality
5499620	5501620	and I would say
5501620	5505460	Peterson for me at least seems like he's touching into
5506260	5507620	Uh
5507620	5514820	Or at least he himself, which is quite ironic given that he is such an open person who who you know focuses on philosophy and ideas all the time
5515860	5518340	Uh, he has hey he has this kind of
5519060	5524100	I would probably I wouldn't even call it like a spite or a hateful thing. It's not I'm not trying to moralize it
5524100	5526340	I'll put put any kind of moral baggage, but
5527540	5531300	He he has this feel of difference of what's happening in the
5532420	5536020	The the trans movement, uh, and and and and kissing point is
5536740	5543620	Uh, I think a few months ago, uh, kyle kalensky again a person. I really like I watch him all the time secular talk
5544340	5548660	Uh interviewed peterson and asked him would you would you ban?
5549300	5550580	trans uh
5550580	5554500	Oh a conversion surgery, uh, even for adults. Yeah for adults. Yeah
5555060	5559700	Yeah, I was like personally for me. I would say unequivocally. No, I wouldn't if you're me too
5560420	5563780	Just you know do what do what you want to do, uh, right?
5564820	5570660	You know, um, but he said, uh, I've got to think about it because he was and here's where I think he was trying to play
5570740	5574260	You know daddy who's telling society how to be you know, like you should live this way
5574420	5579300	Which is which is which is fine. Like I mean we look I I think he's got uh, I I believe this
5579860	5584260	Sincerely, I think he's trying to do what's right. He's got good at least to us at least
5585220	5590340	To to to the extent that one can have good intent. He he does have good intent
5590980	5593140	um, and so do you think
5594020	5596020	He he unfortunately
5596580	5600260	falls into this point here where he does have this kind of fear of difference where
5600660	5605540	The trans thing isn't just merely about free speech. It is something beyond that to this idea of
5606100	5608100	breaking down binaries, let's say
5608740	5611780	Yeah, well this um, and maybe in just f y maybe this is
5612260	5615780	The last point we can wrap up on and then because there's there's when we're done
5615860	5618340	And when we're done this conversation, I want to ask you something after we're done recording
5618900	5623540	But this yeah, maybe this is we can we can end here and have a chance for another one. Um
5624740	5626740	This goes back to the point about
5627300	5632500	Again, I feel like this can be used to describe basically anything that is bad
5633140	5635140	We're like fear of difference
5635140	5638260	That's a human universal doesn't fascism or otherwise
5638820	5643140	That's like tribalism. These people are different from me different equals
5645140	5647140	Potential but also danger
5647380	5653620	I don't know if that's true though when you say it's a human universal sort of interrupting because I would say I am very much
5654100	5656740	enamored by difference like my my whole life is
5657380	5661060	Looking into difference like I constantly look into what's novel what's new
5661700	5664740	You know, I in fact get aesthetic pleasure from it. So
5665460	5667460	sure, but that but
5667620	5672500	You know, it's it's it's it's a it's relative difference, right? So for example, if I'm comparing two cars
5673780	5675460	you know, uh
5675460	5679540	Pick up truck in a lamborghini. There's a lot of different, you know, there's a there's a lot of difference there
5679540	5683540	But they're both cars and if I'm comparing two different cultures a lot of difference there
5683540	5690260	But we're both we have some common understanding if you know, like a psychopath who literally sees the world differently from you
5691860	5695460	You know, it's like how much difference are you? I see what I'm saying like the difference
5696340	5698340	I see that you know saying yeah, so
5698500	5700500	and and and that's
5701620	5703380	you know
5703380	5705380	Like we loved we love to travel
5705860	5707860	precisely because
5708180	5710180	and it's interesting because like
5710500	5711620	It's I think it's the opposite
5711620	5714100	We love to travel not because we like to experience different cultures
5714100	5717460	But because in the experience of the difference we recognize our commonality
5718020	5724180	Right that wherever I go people still love each other and you know, they eat and share meals and all that stuff and it's kind of that
5725220	5726340	the
5726340	5729540	By exploring the differences we have a deeper appreciation for our commonality
5729860	5735940	But if we truly went somewhere where it was different like we're like no children are abused for fun and ritual here
5736820	5738820	There's a reason you'd be afraid of that, right?
5740500	5742500	So fear of difference
5743700	5745700	You know, I think
5746900	5752580	Again, I think that's inherent and it's the quick like the quick it's like is but again Peterson's whole thing is
5753700	5755780	No differences where opportunity lies, right?
5755780	5759860	Like you have to you know get out like the whole Abraham story get out of your dad's tent
5760260	5762420	get out of your dad's basement and go out into the world because
5763380	5769780	Chaos, you know slay the dragon to get the gold you have to confront difference and fear and the you have to confront
5770660	5774420	Confront the unknown to bring about order you have to make order out of the unknown
5774660	5778660	Because if you're just in order all the time you have nothing to just become stagnant. Yeah
5779220	5783380	So the fear of difference, you know, but again, I like I also think
5784420	5787940	Well, is is is the far left, you know, the the the super
5788900	5792900	Gender ideologues are they not also fear of difference from their orthodoxy?
5793300	5796340	Well, yeah, yeah a conservative christian or a conservative
5796980	5798900	Muslim or something like wouldn't they be
5799540	5802340	Wait a second. This person has a very rigid
5803780	5805780	Uh
5806100	5809140	Appreciation for these traditions that we hold to be bad
5809300	5815460	So they would just you know, their fear would be just as much as anyone else's right? That's why I'm saying it's a kind of universal
5815780	5819620	So you're trying. Yeah, I see that. Yeah, I have a few points about difference
5819860	5821060	But I think
5821060	5824420	We're short on time and you said you've got a question to ask from me
5824580	5828980	But before you do ask that question, Paul, could I uh, could I just request?
5829380	5831780	I I really want to read the excerpt out of the
5832580	5837140	Hanaran book because it's connected to a lot of the points here. It's connected. Yeah number 10
5837700	5838740	Um
5838740	5842980	So do you want to first ask me the question and then I'll read so I want to ask you something after we record
5843140	5850180	Or after the recording's over when we're done. It's a logistical question unrelated to that. Oh, yeah, absolutely. So, uh, anyway
5850980	5855620	There are there are a few other look. I'm not certainly saying from my point of view that
5856100	5861140	Peterson perfectly aligns to all 14 of these points that would be bizarre and insane
5861540	5864660	I'm just looking at a few points here and trying to view his work
5865540	5867380	via this framework
5867380	5869540	and a big thing
5869620	5873380	Here's okay. This is going to be a difficult thing to articulate, but I'm going to try my best. So
5876020	5877780	A big thing for him
5877780	5878980	which I
5878980	5881940	Was initially quite enamored by this idea of strength
5882180	5885700	I've always appreciated strength the appreciated competence
5886340	5889940	and this kind of being the best version of yourself to use like a
5890660	5892740	terrible cliched cliched term
5893620	5898900	And the the importance of putting yourself together and and and trying to in some sense
5898980	5905460	Be be a gold, you know, just like aspire towards this highest ideal and in in many ways he himself is
5906420	5912340	very much enamored by the strongman persona. He loves people like jaco or people like, um
5913380	5915540	Even Joe Rogan, um, yeah
5915700	5917700	Joe Rogan is a complicated
5917780	5918980	case, but
5918980	5924900	Sure, not all complicated. Yeah, aren't we aren't we all uh, so the point Hannah Aaron makes though is
5925700	5930340	Peterson and in his book maps of meaning he he's I recall I read it a few years ago. He says
5931540	5937380	The the course for a totalitarianism or fascism just to keep it within context
5937860	5946100	Is apathy indifference this feeling of uh, I don't care. I'm not going to carry the world's burden and do something about it
5947540	5954260	But funny enough though Hannah Aaron makes the complete opposite point and and she says no in fact
5954740	5959460	Indifference by itself isn't a reason for fascism or apathy by itself
5959700	5963300	So people just minding their own business that say they're not caring about what's going on in the world
5963700	5965700	isn't a reason for fascism, but it's
5966900	5969940	Quite the contrary the opposite where it's people who think
5970420	5975380	That they have to be this great person this this strongman. This this hero who
5976020	5979780	carries the burden of the world and and lives his like Nietzschean life
5980340	5981380	uh
5981380	5986100	Those are the people that end up becoming fascists and so this uh, just for this conversation
5986100	5989220	I I had I read this a while back, but I had to like I
5989940	5995220	I was I I did highlight the point so I could find it easily. Um, this is the penguin
5996020	5999380	The the the penguin modern classics version so page 100
6001220	6003220	Sorry page 410
6003220	6009940	Uh from Hannah Aaron's the origins of totalitarianism great book. I recommend it. I recommend everyone should read it
6009940	6013540	It's it's a it's a very easy read too. Like she's a really good writer
6014100	6018340	So I'm not gonna page 410 though. It is page 4 and 10. Yeah, I told you
6019620	6024740	I'm into this nerdy shit. You know that, right? You probably already figured that out. Right, right. That's fair
6025300	6030580	But here's so I'm not gonna read the whole page. That'll take way too long, but there are two excerpts the first is
6031460	6036340	She states this is about what leads to uh totalitarianism
6037220	6040100	Now this is in the context of post world war two
6041540	6047620	Indifference to public affairs neutrality on political issues are in themselves no sufficient course
6048100	6050100	for the rise of totalitarian movements
6051380	6052420	so
6052420	6057540	That that's the point I made before indifference isn't particularly a bad thing and then she goes on to explain
6058420	6059700	that
6059700	6065300	The problem though is in fact when she calls it the bourgeois society the bourgeois society
6066100	6068420	When they start feeling some of the things
6068980	6072900	Animated in this list things like the fear of difference things like uh
6073700	6082420	Where's the other one? I'm not content for the week. Sorry. Uh, selective populism where the the the majority of people are feeling threatened by these
6083060	6087540	Minorities like it could be the lgbdq folks or you know migrants or whoever
6087780	6093380	I don't think most people in the west are afraid of migrants. I would let's just focus on uh the lgbdq
6094180	6101060	That that group so and then she says the bourgeois feel threatened by them to their way of life to their traditions
6101540	6109140	And therefore what happens is they they look for this strongman this this failure and then she states
6110020	6112020	sorry not this failure this uh
6112020	6114020	this this person who's gonna um
6114500	6120660	Kind of embody all the the burdens of the public and do something about it like let's say even like a trumpian figure
6120820	6126820	Uh, these but these bourgeois attitudes are very useful for those forms of dictatorship
6126820	6131300	So the attitude she talks about is kind of what I describe as feeling of or what's going on
6131380	6135940	We're living in uncertain times our way of life is being challenged. It's being
6136580	6138980	Destroyed by these outsiders by the other
6139620	6146500	These bourgeois attitudes are very useful for these forms of dictatorship in which and here's the important point
6147140	6154020	A strong man takes upon himself the troublesome responsibility for the conduct of public affairs
6154660	6160420	They are positive hindrance to totalitarian movements which can tolerate bourgeois individualism
6160900	6162900	No more than any kind of individualism
6163060	6166980	So the the the point she's trying to make is that the the latter bit didn't really matter
6166980	6169700	but the point point point she's trying to make is when
6170260	6172260	The strong man
6173140	6177700	Beals the kind of burden of society and is that it places heroic role almost
6178180	6181940	You know messianic role to to to save people
6182500	6188420	That is what leads to this card personality and she goes on to like mob rule and whatnot and gives rise to a fascist
6188660	6191620	Like like a Hitler or like a miscellany or
6192340	6194500	uh, like a metwaltz sometimes, um
6195460	6196500	so
6196500	6203700	Anyway, just that that's the point i'm trying to make here because he does emphasize a lot on the importance of strength and the strong man and greatness
6204580	6206580	Do you think that?
6206900	6210020	i'm not saying there's a direct correlation, but it's a there's this like
6210820	6212820	fine line where it could
6213780	6220580	Either inadvertently let's say lead to fascistic tendencies in society as a whole
6221780	6223780	In peterson's work or in waltz
6224580	6231540	Oh, no, no, not not. I don't I don't care about waltz. I in fact think he's his penis work. Uh, peasants. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I agree here. Yeah
6232260	6234260	um
6234260	6235300	so
6235300	6237380	And this is such an interesting topic because
6238660	6242820	It gets into the archetypal structure of the human mind. Hmm where
6243860	6245860	I believe and I think it is
6246340	6247940	the case
6247940	6249940	That to be human
6250100	6252900	Means you have you have within you
6253860	6257700	a predisposal to respond to certain
6259620	6261620	What would you call it? Uh
6265140	6267140	Certain
6268340	6271300	Symbols and words and
6272340	6276820	Psychological content, you know in a certain way you are predisposed to respond
6277300	6281700	To certain psychological content in a certain way and the example of that would be
6282260	6285300	Exactly your point about strength. Why why why are
6286020	6288020	Why is it the case that all human beings
6288580	6290420	would be wired
6290420	6291380	for
6291380	6293940	To admire strength inherently. Well
6294660	6300660	From an evolutionary perspective, the obvious reason would be you need strong people to keep you from getting eaten by, you know
6301540	6304580	Werewolves and all that shit or not werewolves, but you know, yeah
6305060	6308660	Well, well that affordably werewolves and all that dragon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
6309380	6315780	No, but hold on. Just just just remember mate. I think I didn't make myself clear. Hannah. Yeah, go ahead. I make a natural
6316100	6318100	naturalistic claim. Sorry. I can't talk today
6318900	6323540	I'm getting very kind of excited about this topic because this is something I've talked about a lot. It's more
6324260	6330660	She's she's in fact making a very marxist point here where she's she's despite. She's not a marxist
6331140	6334660	She's saying it's the bourgeois society. So that's essentially most of us
6335380	6340660	Uh, yep, we kind of have this individualistic way of life. They do they do things how they do things
6341620	6346740	And then when that way of life feels threatened, so it's not all human beings feel threatened by
6347620	6348820	different
6348820	6351780	Certain kind of people which is let's say the majority
6352260	6355620	I'm not saying that's the case, but just for all the intentional purposes
6356420	6358420	When the majority feels threatened
6358500	6363940	A strong man comes into power and this is a cult personality. Sure. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair
6364020	6368900	And I so I would tie that into what I said. So there's there's that universal element
6368900	6374580	There's the archetypal element where to be human means you are wired to respond to certain
6375700	6376580	you know
6376580	6378580	content or behaviors or symbols
6378980	6380580	and I would say and so
6380580	6387940	Recognizing that so when it comes to what happens when the middle class what happens when my way of life gets threatened, you know, it's like, um
6388820	6392420	If you know if we can talk about this like it's like the school shootings, right?
6392420	6394420	You know how many like in america
6395060	6401060	People view as this epidemic while these, you know, like in uvalde and newtown and all these different places. It's like, yeah, that's bad
6402100	6404100	You know, obviously, I don't feel any
6406580	6408580	You know, unless your psychopath you disagree
6409700	6411700	But you have to remember like
6411860	6416180	That happens every day in chicago and every day in these inner cities
6416340	6420820	You know how many kids are shot and people are shot every day and we don't hear about it
6420980	6425860	But as soon as the massacre occurs at a place that looks like where I would have gone to school
6426900	6428900	Now it's a significant issue
6429300	6431300	and to me that
6432340	6437620	I don't know that when you were describing what hennard was saying that evokes of that kind of idea where oh now my
6438340	6442980	School is getting shot up. That's not supposed to happen. Everything else. That's that you know, that just
6443620	6447220	I don't think about that but what now it's in my the bourgeoisie kind of perspective
6448180	6450180	and
6450420	6452420	Yeah, it's like
6454500	6458340	So, you know in some sense, I just agree straight up, you know, I I think uh
6459860	6461860	Yeah, I don't I don't
6461940	6466820	Because it is it is the people who have to live day to day and don't concern themselves with
6467460	6470900	That's the shootings are their way of life. So there's no
6471780	6473780	tension that
6473860	6475300	catalyzes some
6475300	6477860	broader movement because that's just how they're in on the day to day
6477940	6483060	But yeah, when when it's the bourgeoisie so to speak that gets the privilege perspective that gets threatened
6483140	6485140	I can see that in many ways what
6485860	6487860	What kind of saddens me is I think
6488420	6490420	unfortunately
6490420	6495540	Peterson's work has now just become a way to just justify the status quo
6496260	6499940	It's it's become a way to justify the typical bourgeois way of life
6500020	6505940	Which as a leftist and again, I'm biased here because I come from a left-wing point of view. Um
6506660	6508660	I'm pull on a leftist
6508740	6509860	uh
6509860	6513940	What even that like because you're not fully a leftist at least not my definition because
6514580	6519380	You don't you know, if you don't buy into what I would regard as stereotypically leftist like
6520180	6524020	Children like KKK is you know the conservatives are KKK and children
6524180	6527300	I don't know your perspective on children being allowed to transition. I'm very
6528500	6531780	Yeah, that's tough on man. I mean I am more on your side with that
6532740	6537460	Right and that's a function of just the medical literature. That's almost not even a philosophical
6537780	6542500	Exactly. Yeah, whether or not what is the empirical data say? I think yeah, look my like I
6543860	6547460	When I was I interrupted you I interrupted you. No, no, that's that's totally fine
6547460	6551540	But I'm just too on your point like when I was a kid. I didn't even know, you know, if
6552820	6557940	I don't even know if I was real, you know, like it was probably my whole other traumatic different thing
6557940	6563300	I think you psychoanalyzed myself, but therefore one should be yeah, I think I'm more on the idea of
6564100	6567140	Over there, perhaps I'm a bit more conservative when it comes to children
6567940	6569060	but but
6569060	6574340	Especially when it comes to economics, you know, I I believe I strongly believe in unions, you know, I think
6574980	6581700	Most most things should be public and and you know, anyway economically speaking. I'm certainly a leftist
6582340	6583460	Uh
6583460	6589860	And and my problem though is that's where that's why I was I was really keen to read out this this excerpt from hanaran's book
6590420	6595460	Because what she says is these these people who feel threatened aren't
6596580	6602660	Aren't she doesn't say everyone feels threatened. She's very specific to to put it to because she's a social social philosopher
6603060	6604100	to a
6604100	6610260	To a certain group of people which is a majority that the bourgeois the bourgeoisie for the bourgeois way of life and and
6611060	6613060	Here's where I mean, I get very very
6613620	6617060	Kind of if you know, um, I would consider myself an anti capitalist
6618100	6619620	Even though I see
6619620	6621700	Capitalism has has its merits too
6622820	6624820	And you know, like where Peterson says
6625380	6629620	You know, you you go and do your thing, you know, like focus on your life be be great
6630100	6631700	You build your business
6631700	6634180	But but here you know at one point though
6634260	6636980	I think we should all go back to good old Christianity and be like no
6636980	6640980	At sometimes, you know, you shouldn't go and do your thing even though your life is in shambles
6640980	6642180	You should probably go and
6642180	6649620	Be live a life of service and yeah, I said, you know, you know, maybe maybe live live via christian metaphysics and yeah
6649940	6652660	I don't know if you saw my critique of jordan peterson
6654100	6656900	It's called rest in peace or we need to rescue jordan peterson from the belly of the whale
6656980	6661140	I watched that. Yes. Yeah, my whole point was like, hey, I don't know if I mentioned it in that one
6661140	6663700	But I mentioned it somewhere where I was good. Yeah, it's like, hey, there's
6664660	6668900	Peterson's really fallen into this like I'm a dirt. I'm an evil capitalist and I don't apologize about it
6668900	6670900	It's like, okay. Well, that's a problem
6671140	6675140	Because there's problems with capitalism and like I'm gonna I think I'm gonna do a video on
6675620	6680660	Eric Weinstein's Marxism is what I'm gonna call it something like that where Eric Weinstein has some very
6681300	6683300	salient critiques of capitalism
6683860	6689140	That are, you know, map on to Marxism and not derive from Marxism per se, but it's like
6690100	6692100	So when you say you're an anti-capitalist, I'm like I
6692900	6694900	completely
6694980	6699460	Maybe I wouldn't go so far as to use that term, but I'm certainly sympathetic to whatever you for the same reasons
6699460	6704820	I would call I would consider myself a post capitalist. I think we live in post sure. That's fair. Yes
6705300	6710420	We have surplus value and we need to figure out how to make society more. Yeah, especially with AI coming
6710420	6715300	It's like man. Last thing we need is more innovation. We need to figure out how to get this fixed
6715620	6720260	Yeah, and you know the reason and again, you know, here I'm very traditional the reason I am that it's because I'm a Christian
6720340	6723620	I believe in the teachings of Christ that we in fact should
6724180	6729060	base a society not that not a society that's transactional but rather a society that's
6729540	6731540	undergirded by love
6731780	6733780	And here I'm very much a christian so
6734180	6739060	And then that's where I'm I'm wondering and I look paula. I may be being a bit unfair
6740020	6742500	You know with you here because you certainly
6742820	6744020	Uh
6744020	6748740	Are true to what you proclaim and you do criticize Peterson like in that video
6749380	6751380	When you you see he's wrong
6751940	6752820	but
6752820	6755860	In some sense by being kind of an apologist for Peterson
6756100	6760420	I wonder if if you can't miss out on that that idea of oh
6761140	6764740	He's just defending the status quo now. Like, you know, he's critical of
6765300	6770820	Virtually everything is critical of Greta Thunberg's, uh, you know climate climate change book
6771060	6776260	He's critical of any any kind of leftist movement that tries to make society a bit more egalitarian
6776580	6782100	It seems like and maybe this happens since you joined daily wire. I don't know, but I maybe that's great
6782180	6785700	That's doing a little harm than good. Sure. I would push back on some of those
6785860	6789140	I don't think he's critical of every leftist movement because again
6790420	6792420	I think he makes in my opinion
6792900	6794900	The best intellectual
6795460	6798820	philosophical case for why the left needs to exist
6799380	6802340	Right. Like his case for why we need liberals
6802980	6805460	Is compelling even to conservatives. I think
6806740	6813940	Um going back to that point about you need the left to be able to update the current structures to new environments. Yeah, yeah, yeah
6814740	6815940	so
6815940	6817700	but to your point
6817700	6822660	In my apologia for Jordan Peterson. I may be missing the degree to which she values a status quo
6823940	6825940	Certainly possible. I mean, I know I'm biased so I'm
6826820	6830900	Also, I know I'm I know I'm dumb. So I'm missing things off that regard and I know I'm biased
6830900	6834740	So I'm missing things on a whole lot. Yeah, so the the idea of I'm missing things for sure
6835380	6837140	the I don't
6837140	6842100	That point about I may be defending the state or you know, could be defending the status quo too much
6842180	6843380	I would kind of
6843380	6844900	push back and say
6844900	6848980	The status quo needs to be defended to some degree status quo does not mean bad
6849620	6850580	per se
6850580	6853940	Even though like when we use that phrase like you're just defending the status quo
6854180	6860260	The obvious implication is that that's not a good thing and the simple interpretation of why that is the case is
6860900	6866340	Well, the status quo was you know, slavery was a thing and then black people were indiscriminated against and then status quo was women weren't getting
6866340	6868180	Right, so
6868180	6870660	When people say the status quo, they're usually referring to
6871220	6873700	The moral failings of our current society
6874100	6877940	But if but if the status quo just means like, you know, the current state, right?
6877940	6881620	Or I don't know what actually the latin, you know, you know, whatever that means, but like
6882580	6888020	You could very easily say like well, the status quo includes like the first amendment like we have free speech. That's status quo
6888820	6891380	So that needs to be defended, right? So it's so
6892340	6897620	It's it's it's a back and forth in that way. I think I think you know, I know kyle our mutual friend
6897620	6902820	He's a he's very much a fan of uh, john vacay and here's where again
6902820	6903860	kyle
6903860	6905860	Maxwell. Yeah, Maxwell. Yeah
6906580	6911060	You've had you've had him on a couple of times. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. In fact, I found you via his
6911780	6915220	Okay, that's right. Yes. I was trying to remember how how yeah, we came in contact
6915220	6918900	Yeah, yeah, and and I kind of cause a huge fan of uh, john vacay
6919300	6920180	vacay, yes
6920180	6925140	Vacay and so vacay has this idea of dialogues, which is I certainly I fall on that cam too
6925140	6931620	It's like there has to be this constant to and fro but the vacay because he comes from like a kind of like a holistic perspective
6931700	6934740	He's like, uh, we we all have a conversation
6935300	6938420	You know, it's like we all see kumbaya and it comes like this higher truth
6938500	6940500	And I personally am more of
6940580	6943780	I'm a a nazi zhikian where I think it's this
6944260	6946740	Truth is found not in a higher truth itself
6947060	6952100	It's found in the conflict itself and the conflict is ongoing. It'll never end. It's like a sure
6952420	6959140	So like the the hagel's idea a lot of people mischaracterized hagel and I am not saying I understand hagel because I absolutely don't
6959620	6962900	But they say oh, there's a theses a theses
6963220	6965380	Antithesis and then there's a synthesis a higher
6965860	6968740	sublation hagel's and say that hagel says in fact, it's a
6969860	6973300	ongoing thing where spirit unravels where it's just
6973940	6979060	There's a theses antithesis and there's a synthesis and there's another theses antithesis synthesis
6979060	6985700	So it's it's as if and it kind of relates to what you're saying too because the left and right have to be in conversation
6985780	6988100	Or sometimes conflict hopefully
6988660	6997220	Without too much bloodshed or violence that in fact that's reality itself. It's just that it's not some higher outcome and
6998180	7002260	and okay, I'm going off on a rant here and I'm kind of netting out on hagel but
7003300	7006820	One thing I think we can all agree is that point you made that we are all
7007860	7009860	equally ignorant or
7010420	7015220	as vosh said in your debate, he said that most people are retards, but
7016180	7020820	No, he's right man is retarded. Yeah, but he's right, but he's right, but he didn't go fine
7020820	7024580	Well, the way he implied it. I don't think was right, but the point
7025300	7031620	The the charitable interpretation of that point. Yes, we're all dumb. Yeah. Yeah, because you know zhuzhek zhuzhek makes a really good point
7031620	7032740	He says
7032740	7037380	I'm not saying that there are these smart intellectuals and then there are these common people who are stupid
7037380	7042260	He's saying everyone's stupid. Even the intellectuals are stupid. That's what and I agree with him. I agree with him
7043220	7046100	And yeah, look, mate. I feel like
7047060	7051700	We've been a bit over the time. I hope you don't have anything else. No, no problem. I've got no other
7052420	7057300	Obligations today that are but I think we did touch on I don't know personally for me
7057460	7062020	I I wasn't planning to go through the whole list because that would be I think a waste of time
7063460	7065300	But I think we did
7065300	7067380	I don't know if you made I wouldn't even call it progress
7067460	7071940	Well, we did clarify some some points pertaining to fascism that is from my
7072740	7075540	Point of view, but before I you know before I put words in your mouth
7075540	7081460	Is there anything else that you want to elucidate or clarify? Not just regarding to the fascism, but but even yeah
7081460	7084340	Yeah, well, no, I just the most interesting watchers debate. Yeah
7085140	7087940	Yeah, well on the on the debate, you know, I think
7088740	7089940	I
7089940	7094420	What I said at the beginning I think stands. I'm you know, but this other stuff I might think but in this conversation particular I was
7095300	7099700	Again, you being a vosh fan and you being a self-described, you know
7100180	7105220	Pretty hard leftist or certainly economically and all that and I'm I would actually like economically. I'm pretty far
7105220	7107220	I don't do that many videos about economics
7107700	7108980	um
7108980	7113380	But I think that'll I might dip my toe into that to some degree. Um
7114260	7116900	And I'm so I'm so I certainly feel you there, but it was just interesting like
7118180	7123460	I prior to this the last time we talked I would not have characterized you as or I would not have guessed that you were
7123700	7126260	Like a big vosh fan or or anything like that
7126820	7129860	um, and I and it just it just reaffirms my belief of like
7131540	7136100	The attitude I went into that debate with of I'm going to speak to the best of vosh
7136740	7141380	Which in part is like I'm trying to speak to the good faith people who listen to him because they clearly are
7141860	7146740	Right, if he was if he was as bad as people say he is people like you I don't think would be fans of them
7147140	7152580	Right. Yeah. Yeah. So and I like I said, I have a friend of mine who's a fan of his and there's no chance
7152660	7156660	I'm just gonna you know, he's a bad person because he likes bad people. Um
7157860	7162420	So that that was so I enjoyed this. Yeah, it was it was just it was interesting to
7163300	7166660	Elucidate that out and I'm I'm I'm reaffirmed in my belief that
7167380	7168500	You know, I could have done things better
7168500	7172260	But I think the attitude that I went in was the right attitude and so I appreciate it
7172740	7175940	Yeah, but we could you know turn the table so to speak and be oh
7176420	7178420	Vosh's fans would see you
7179140	7181140	Who I think you were
7181220	7186340	You you you you were kind of like a great interlocutor for for wash. Let's say where
7186980	7192420	Certainly you were coming from the the point of view you you were in a difficult place because you had to defend Peterson
7192420	7196340	It's always harder to defend a stance than to critique and
7196740	7199300	And fought with a with a person or a
7199540	7203540	Especially when Peterson tweets so goddamn much and he says some of these stupid things, right?
7203700	7207380	Correct. Yeah, and he's like he's everywhere and he's he's he's in fact a chaotic guy
7207460	7211540	Like he's all oh, yeah, he goes on all these podcasts. So it's it's not easy to do that
7212020	7216900	But then I I would say like for me personally because I knew you prior to the wash debate
7217060	7219060	I knew you were a good bloke
7219460	7220580	but
7220580	7221700	now
7221700	7229860	So-called radical leftist or whoever that's on washers side that think all uh, Peterson bros, uh, are these like I don't know
7230580	7232580	White
7233140	7237220	Idiots would probably have the same. Um, let's say
7237700	7239940	I don't know revelation or or same kind of
7241300	7244980	Peterson's fans the way you did about washers fans and I'm glad that there was that
7245460	7249220	Yeah, I got probably a dozen or so comments saying yeah, hey, I'm a wash fan
7249220	7253460	But I really appreciated the conversation, but I'm like that's good. That's a win as far as I'm concerned. Yeah
7254340	7256020	awesome, uh
7256020	7258020	Thanks a lot poll. I really appreciated this
7258340	7263460	As I said, man, I think you're a great bloke and congrats on all the success you're having with your channel recently
7263860	7266020	Hit 3 000 subscribers man. Yes
7266660	7270420	I reckon you're gonna you're gonna be at 5k 10k no time
7271620	7274980	Yes, we'll see we'll see what kind of risks and responsibilities that opens up
7274980	7279940	So, uh, but you know, that's the point. Yeah, the risk of responsibilities is a is a
7280500	7282980	It's certainly that comes along with great power as they say
7285220	7287220	That great philosopher, um
7287540	7291220	I haven't watched your video on the postmodern
7291780	7293940	Neomaxist the recent one. I think you'd like that one
7294340	7298260	I probably would especially being a theory nerd. I take a look at that, but uh,
7298980	7302500	not very uh, it's it's very it's theory presented through the
7303060	7305860	It's it's theory presented through the lens of
7306580	7308820	This is nerd shit, but we need to talk about it type stuff
7309620	7315060	I'll leave it at that. It does. It does. That's case in point there, right? It comes from the real world. Yeah. Yeah
7315220	7319140	Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just it's communicated in a way. That's not your traditional
7319380	7323700	Oh, this is how we talk about theory. Well, you are a comedian comedy. You are a comedian. Exactly
7324900	7330420	That's why that's why that's why I put it in there. All of this is jokes. It's just everything life is a joke, you know
7330420	7333220	Life is a joke. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was right. It's all absurd
7334180	7338340	All right, thanks. I think I'm gonna stop recording now and that works
