00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
You said that it was, well, initially human nature or

00:04.320 --> 00:08.480
understanding human nature, but also reading Chomsky, which is

00:08.480 --> 00:11.480
clear from reading your work, your, I don't want to call you a

00:11.480 --> 00:13.640
Chomsky, and that's like a crass fear of putting it, but it

00:13.640 --> 00:18.760
seems like you're settling more on, let's say, Chomsky side over

00:18.760 --> 00:23.180
someone like BF Skinner. And so if I would, if you don't mind, I

00:23.180 --> 00:28.920
would love for you to sort of elucidate this ongoing, I don't

00:28.920 --> 00:33.160
want to call it a war, but debate between the Skinner side

00:33.240 --> 00:37.160
and Chomsky side. And in fact, in one podcast, you even said

00:37.160 --> 00:39.600
that this debate is still ongoing. It's not like it's

00:39.600 --> 00:44.520
Yeah, yeah, very much so. Nothing, nothing changes.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.560
Yeah, there's not a conclusion. This is the answer sort of

00:47.560 --> 00:50.040
thing, which is which is what's lovely about science in my

00:50.040 --> 00:53.960
view. So what's this debate in linguistics and cognitive

00:53.960 --> 00:57.200
science between Chomsky and Skinner?

00:57.760 --> 01:04.560
So that debate at the time was how to explain behavior and

01:04.640 --> 01:09.760
generally in linguistic behavior in particular, and Skinner was

01:09.760 --> 01:15.320
hoping to explain that in terms of properties of the information

01:15.320 --> 01:19.000
that's available to us, what's out there in the environment and

01:22.520 --> 01:26.800
responses and the links between them and associations that we

01:26.800 --> 01:32.280
formed between them. And basically, the idea is that to

01:32.320 --> 01:37.080
explain how we behave, which is all he cared about, all we need

01:37.080 --> 01:40.800
to do is look at the properties of what's out there rather than

01:40.800 --> 01:45.480
what the organism brings internally to that how the

01:45.480 --> 01:49.920
organism views the stimulus and how the organism chooses to

01:49.920 --> 01:56.120
response. And what Chomsky made very clear is that the study of

01:56.120 --> 01:59.400
behavior ought to start with the study of the organism, it's

01:59.400 --> 02:02.440
really kind of maybe you can think about it as a form of

02:02.440 --> 02:08.080
biology thinking about what is it that the organism brings with

02:08.160 --> 02:14.080
themselves to to this task. So to make it very, you know, very

02:14.080 --> 02:19.520
concrete. So why is it that, you know, you you understand a

02:19.520 --> 02:24.080
sentence, how is it, you know, that you have a sentence such as

02:24.600 --> 02:30.480
John is eager to please? How do you know that it's John? Who is

02:30.480 --> 02:36.320
being pleased? Being pleased? Whereas if you know, John is

02:36.880 --> 02:42.880
easy to please, then sorry, put it the other way around. So if

02:42.880 --> 02:48.000
John is easy to please, it is the one who is being pleased is

02:48.000 --> 02:51.840
John, whereas if John is eager to please, then he is pleasing

02:51.840 --> 02:57.600
Bill or somebody else, right? And what Chomsky made clear is

02:57.600 --> 03:03.080
that interpretations such like that, the only way to make sense

03:03.080 --> 03:08.800
of them is to figure out what is it that the person knows about

03:08.800 --> 03:11.760
language and how they encode information that's available to

03:11.760 --> 03:17.640
them. Any pointed out that our ability to do so to encode

03:17.640 --> 03:22.400
information that's available to us is constrained in part by

03:22.440 --> 03:26.520
innate principles of language that he called Universal

03:26.520 --> 03:27.000
Grammar.

03:27.760 --> 03:31.800
And would you say that's sort of something like innate knowledge

03:31.800 --> 03:33.840
that you write about in this book?

03:33.920 --> 03:38.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So as I read Chomsky, this is primarily a

03:38.360 --> 03:42.040
treatise on human nature and about innate knowledge, which he

03:42.040 --> 03:46.000
happened to advance in the domain of language. But I always read

03:46.000 --> 03:48.160
him as a philosopher, essentially.

03:48.200 --> 03:52.920
Certainly, yeah, I mean, he in fact, I believe he was the he

03:53.120 --> 03:56.720
chaired the Department of Philosophy at MIT, probably for a

03:56.720 --> 03:59.760
long time. So he has a really good background in philosophy

03:59.760 --> 04:00.280
certainly.

04:01.400 --> 04:06.720
I was professor so with the idea of Universal Grammar, I've

04:06.720 --> 04:11.920
always always been thinking about that idea like is is Universal

04:11.920 --> 04:15.360
Grammar itself, this type of innate knowledge? And is it

04:15.360 --> 04:19.480
something that that we can sort of study analytically?

04:20.240 --> 04:22.240
Oh, and empirically,

04:22.280 --> 04:25.680
empirically, beautiful. And I would say experimentally. Yeah,

04:25.680 --> 04:30.040
so. So all you need is to start with a good theory of what you

04:30.040 --> 04:34.800
think Universal Grammar is all about. And then go to the lab and

04:34.800 --> 04:37.920
try to figure out, do you have evidence for this thing? And it's

04:37.920 --> 04:39.480
not easy, but it's doable.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.320
I see, I see. So if we could play a bit of devil's advocate,

04:44.600 --> 04:48.000
because I've read, in fact, apart from Chomsky's political

04:48.000 --> 04:50.760
work, of course, I've read his book on language, which was which

04:50.760 --> 04:53.320
was an excellent read. And I found it quite hard to read as an

04:53.320 --> 04:59.080
ear five, to be totally honest. But I do know there are certain

04:59.080 --> 05:02.240
people still in the field, as you said, it's an ongoing debate

05:02.280 --> 05:07.400
that kind of are either critical or disagree with some of

05:07.400 --> 05:12.200
Chomsky's ideas, or let's say, values of Universal Grammar. So

05:12.800 --> 05:17.000
what are what are the current criticisms of this idea of innate

05:17.000 --> 05:18.560
knowledge or Universal Grammar?

05:19.080 --> 05:22.080
So to make it clear, I think that in fact, the majority of the

05:22.080 --> 05:28.200
field no longer thinks that no longer sides with Chomsky. I'm

05:28.200 --> 05:31.640
not totally convinced in my reading of the evidence that

05:32.120 --> 05:38.440
that's right. And that's the right conclusion. And the debate

05:38.440 --> 05:43.640
as a debates, as I see it in the domain of language, have always

05:43.640 --> 05:51.400
structured, or have always centered onto issues. One is,

05:51.560 --> 05:55.040
what is the machinery that you need to represent language? So

05:55.040 --> 05:59.400
what kind of representations that you have? And what, and what

05:59.480 --> 06:03.000
and do they are they structured? Are they structured in a

06:03.000 --> 06:06.800
systematic way? Do you need something that is akin to

06:07.000 --> 06:12.800
algebraic rules? Or all you have is basically associations,

06:12.800 --> 06:16.680
very rich set of associations, which apparently this is what

06:16.680 --> 06:21.320
GPT is doing, you know, AI is doing today. So A is what kind of

06:21.320 --> 06:26.680
representations do you have? And do you need explicit structure

06:26.720 --> 06:33.560
in your data, so to speak? The second question is, where these

06:33.600 --> 06:38.000
representations, and the rules, the way you operate over these

06:38.000 --> 06:42.400
representations, where is all this machinery coming from? And

06:42.440 --> 06:46.400
is it in parts specific to language? So are you born with

06:46.400 --> 06:49.080
some principles that are unique to language? And that's what

06:49.080 --> 06:53.920
allows you to acquire language? Or are you relying entirely on

06:54.760 --> 06:59.960
generic mechanisms that operate across domains? So what is

07:00.000 --> 07:05.360
your machinery? And how specific it is, where and where it's

07:05.360 --> 07:12.760
coming from? These are have always been the questions. And

07:12.760 --> 07:20.120
the debate these days are centered on a whether there

07:20.120 --> 07:23.960
are in fact algebraic rules. So this is huge debate about that,

07:23.960 --> 07:28.280
which has been increased and confounded by the rise of AI,

07:28.280 --> 07:32.400
because proponents of that state, like, look, you have the

07:32.400 --> 07:38.280
systems that seem to do just fine. And it's not clear. But

07:38.280 --> 07:43.000
some people, there is a question of whether they in fact have

07:43.000 --> 07:46.960
any algebraic representations at all. And the range of

07:46.960 --> 07:51.520
possibilities range between those who say, there aren't any

07:51.520 --> 07:55.280
structured representations in there at all, or that maybe

07:55.280 --> 07:59.400
they start without them, and they grow them somehow. And all

07:59.400 --> 08:03.240
this becomes really difficult to tell, just because there is so

08:03.240 --> 08:07.640
much data that these systems are exposed to that it's really hard.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.200
So one of the tests that you know, how do you know that there

08:10.200 --> 08:13.640
is an algebraic rules? One of the way to test it is to look at

08:14.200 --> 08:18.320
generalizations, can you generalize to items that are not

08:18.320 --> 08:21.320
similar to anything that you've seen before. But if you're

08:21.320 --> 08:26.880
basically your data set includes everything that we have, then

08:26.880 --> 08:29.840
it becomes very difficult to know whether you'd in fact

08:29.840 --> 08:32.320
generalize or not. So that makes the whole question of

08:33.080 --> 08:39.360
machinery very difficult to decide. Questions of innateness

08:39.360 --> 08:46.200
are difficult to decide for two reasons. A, the success of AI

08:46.200 --> 08:51.440
that kind of presents a big challenge. The other reason is

08:52.600 --> 08:55.360
oftentimes when you point out that there are universals

08:55.360 --> 09:01.360
across languages. So this is one of the main argument or an

09:01.360 --> 09:05.360
important argument to foreign aidness is to argue that, hey,

09:05.400 --> 09:08.560
we look at language after language, and they all show a

09:08.560 --> 09:12.280
certain property. So in my work, we looked at syllable

09:12.280 --> 09:16.720
structure and the fact that languages prefer structures

09:16.720 --> 09:23.920
such as blog to structures such as all bog, LBOG. That seems

09:23.920 --> 09:28.760
very clear. But the thing about this as well as many other

09:28.760 --> 09:33.520
preferences is that there is a correlation between what

09:33.520 --> 09:37.600
languages like to do and what the functional pressures of our

09:37.600 --> 09:42.640
body dictate. So if I ask my undergraduates why blog, then

09:42.640 --> 09:49.560
everybody tells me that what to say. And then intuitive theory

09:49.560 --> 09:53.400
behind it is that it's those functional pressures, meaning

09:54.200 --> 09:58.080
how is it is for you to say the constraints on your

09:58.240 --> 10:01.440
articulatory system and an audition that they're driving

10:01.440 --> 10:07.240
the force. And in every area of language universal, I don't

10:07.480 --> 10:10.920
in many areas of linguistic universals, you find such

10:10.920 --> 10:15.480
correspondences between what languages like to do and some

10:15.480 --> 10:19.520
functional explanation. Phonology is probably the area where you

10:19.520 --> 10:22.480
see those things most clearly. But nowadays, people are

10:22.480 --> 10:27.020
exploring those ideas elsewhere as well. And the problem is that

10:27.040 --> 10:30.540
when people find those correlations, they assume

10:30.540 --> 10:37.080
causation, meaning they if you find any functional explanation

10:37.080 --> 10:42.760
of what's going on, people kind of jump to the conclusion that

10:42.760 --> 10:47.400
it's this functional cause, or functional factor that is

10:47.400 --> 10:51.120
causing the structure that you see. So in this specific case,

10:51.120 --> 10:54.640
why do you prefer a blog? Because it's easy to say, or

10:54.640 --> 10:57.960
because it's easy to hear. That's what my undergraduates

10:58.000 --> 11:04.280
think. And so do professional scientists. And to me, it's not

11:04.280 --> 11:09.240
a done deal. To me, this is an empirical question that you need

11:09.240 --> 11:13.200
to go and explore as indeed we have. And there are ways to do

11:13.200 --> 11:18.320
so. So the fact that you find correlation in principle is

11:18.640 --> 11:22.560
ambiguous between two explanations. One is, it's not

11:22.560 --> 11:26.560
language, it's not your G, it's the functional system, the

11:26.560 --> 11:29.760
sensory and motor systems that are driving the cart here,

11:29.760 --> 11:35.160
that's what makes language the way it is. But the alternative

11:35.160 --> 11:41.640
possibility is, well, maybe it is abstract linguistic principles

11:41.640 --> 11:46.320
that are doing the driving, except for those principles are

11:46.320 --> 11:51.120
not entirely crazy, they're not entirely arbitrary, rather, they

11:51.120 --> 11:56.240
have evolved so that they optimize those sensory and

11:56.240 --> 12:00.160
motor pressures, which I don't think is super surprising. So

12:00.160 --> 12:03.920
that predicts that yes, you will find some correlation between

12:05.160 --> 12:08.320
you know, putative UG and those sensory and motor pressures,

12:08.320 --> 12:12.480
but not but what's doing the pushing was doing what's

12:12.480 --> 12:16.680
pushing the cart, so to speak, is UG rather than sensory motor

12:16.680 --> 12:20.680
system. And merely showing a correlation doesn't adjudicate

12:20.680 --> 12:24.480
between these possibilities. So in my work, we took it very

12:24.480 --> 12:28.320
seriously. So, for example, to figure out whether it's blog

12:28.320 --> 12:30.840
that's doing it, I'm sorry, whether the preference for

12:30.840 --> 12:34.560
blog is coming from, it's easier for you to say than in

12:34.560 --> 12:38.200
collaboration with my colleague, Alvaro Pascualeone, who is a

12:38.400 --> 12:41.600
neuroscientist who does transcarnial magnetic stimulation,

12:41.600 --> 12:45.960
what we did is zapped the motor system that controls the

12:45.960 --> 12:49.480
articulators, the leap specifically, and looked at what

12:49.840 --> 12:53.640
this is doing to your linguistic preferences. And

12:53.640 --> 12:56.880
conversely, what happens when you zap brokers area and what we

12:56.880 --> 13:02.160
found is a dissociation between them. So the point is, these

13:02.160 --> 13:05.560
are questions that you need to explore, you may or may like may

13:05.560 --> 13:09.280
not like the evidence that we produced, I think they're clear,

13:09.280 --> 13:14.480
but the my point is not to defend the solution, but rather to

13:14.480 --> 13:19.320
defend the method. I am very concerned about that time to

13:19.320 --> 13:22.280
jump from correlations to causation, I think this needs

13:22.280 --> 13:25.840
to be sorted out. And I think it's this disagreement that is

13:25.840 --> 13:29.200
behind a lot of the ambiguity that we're having in the field

13:29.200 --> 13:29.800
right now.

13:30.640 --> 13:34.880
April first, I did, in fact, read a blog post written on your

13:34.880 --> 13:39.160
work from your lab by Northeastern University. And so

13:39.160 --> 13:42.760
correct me if I'm wrong, in like a very elementary level, if I

13:42.760 --> 13:48.160
could put it this way, is it that you're at the moment claiming

13:48.200 --> 13:54.160
that it's as if these UG or these abstract principles, they

13:54.160 --> 13:57.480
aren't physical, they aren't arbitrary and random, but they've

13:57.480 --> 14:01.880
kind of evolved to suit our existence as home sapiens, the

14:01.880 --> 14:05.320
same way, let's say a physical limb or something has evolved.

14:06.240 --> 14:10.640
Exactly. Yeah, that's the working hypothesis. But again, I

14:10.640 --> 14:15.760
think for me, it's more important to tell people that just

14:15.760 --> 14:21.200
showing a correlation isn't necessarily proof, it's not a

14:21.200 --> 14:25.720
smoking gun of causation. It's more important for me to emphasize

14:25.720 --> 14:30.760
this methodological claim than to push my own interpretation of

14:30.760 --> 14:33.000
the data. So I think that there's, you know, there is

14:33.000 --> 14:37.560
probably a lot that need to be done, many more controls and to

14:37.600 --> 14:41.000
completely look at this question. And we have contributed some

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
but by no means I would argue that we completely resolve the

14:44.000 --> 14:48.880
issue. What really bothers me is that the attempt to view the

14:48.880 --> 14:51.800
correlation and to jump to the conclusion that oh, we know what's

14:51.800 --> 14:54.280
going on. I think that's that's really unfortunate.
