0	12000	In this episode, I would emphasize for people who are new to Han, my kind of invitation would be
12960	22160	he is really great at connecting our very personal experiences, like the experience of being tired,
22160	30560	the experience of not having enough mental energy to do all the tasks that you're supposed to do.
31600	36560	Our experiences of loneliness, being tired and alone at the end of the day.
37440	46560	And all these experiences, he pays attention to them and he connects them to broader patterns,
46640	55440	broader trends in culture, in society, in technology. And that is really valuable, I think.
55440	63200	He keeps, he doesn't keep the discussion of private experiences at that level, at that scope,
63200	67280	at that original scope of interest. Yes, of course, we're interested in it, but
67920	72800	he helps us make sense of it by putting it in a larger context and different contexts.
72800	79920	And with the help of different thinkers, he introduces us to a host of other valuable
79920	90720	thinkers like Foucault, Plato, Nietzsche, Arendt, Hannah Arendt, and he's very good at connecting
91280	97360	the moments in our thought, in a discussion with the right moments, the right person.
97360	101360	Hey, everyone. Welcome to my conversation with the cognitive psychologist,
101360	108000	writer, fellow bibliophile, and now someone who I can hopefully call my friend, Dr. Davood Gosley.
108720	113760	This certainly was a conversation that I expected to be amiable and good-natured,
113760	118080	and it certainly was. My expectations were met. I've been following Davood's book reviews for
118080	122960	about a year now, and I've thoroughly enjoyed them. And a couple of months ago, I noticed that he's
122960	127600	done a lot of reviews on Byung-Shul Han's work, and they were fantastic reviews. They weren't
127600	133280	mere cheap summaries where you'd quickly get across what the book says, but rather he critiqued them,
133280	138880	he discussed the ideas that spoke to him more deeply, and they always came from his point of
138880	144320	view, despite him reviewing the work of another thinker. And this got me thinking, perhaps I've
144320	150800	always wanted to do an episode or a podcast dedicated to exploring Byung-Shul Han, and I
150880	157760	thought Davood would be the perfect candidate to converse with. And I hope I was a good interlocutor
157760	164240	and brought up the best of both Davood and Byung-Shul Han's work, but you'd be the judge of that.
164240	170240	We spoke about a variety of topics. We discussed Davood's experience in academia, both it's
171280	177040	good and bad, perhaps mostly bad, unfortunately, and also some of the ideas of living in
177040	182480	neoliberal society and the logic of neoliberalism, and then explode some of the concepts that
182480	188160	Byung-Shul Han has introduced to the contemporary critical theory dialogue, let's say. But also,
188160	193040	in many ways, I was joking around during the episode, but I kind of meant in some sense too that,
193760	199600	sorry, I've got a bit of a cold, that I do want this episode to be some kind of propagandistic
200240	206080	conversation for you to go read the work of Byung-Shul Han, because I do think it can bring
206080	211280	great value to your life, especially in the society and culture we live in, where
212000	217120	a lot of the problems are made private and personalized when some of them really aren't
217120	222000	private in the first place. They are social problems. But we discussed this in detail during
222000	226400	the conversation, so I won't get into it right now. That being said, as I tend to do, a bit of a
226400	233040	formal introduction to Davood. Dr. Davood Gosley is a cognitive psychologist. He received his PhD
233040	238800	from the University of Toronto. He has held research and teaching positions at the University
238800	245680	of Vienna, Leiden University, and the University of Macau. He is the author of many scholarly articles
245680	251760	and a book titled Experimental Psychology and Human Agency. Dr. Gosley has a YouTube channel where
251760	258640	he posts book reviews panning a vast array of writers and genres from Heruki Murakami to Byung-Shul
258640	265200	Han and fiction to critical theory. He also runs a book club organized through his Patreon page.
266000	271360	Having said that, here's my conversation with Dr. Davood Gosley, where we discuss the work of Byung-Shul
271360	276880	Han. It's really interesting. I think I subscribe more to kind of the Todd McGovern, in fact,
276880	282000	wrote a book about this, which I'll be talking to him soon. It's called Embracing Alienation.
282000	290560	And I find that I don't try to, like, at least personally, I don't let myself kind of be too
290560	295920	attached, overly attached to the kind of the socio-symbolic order of a certain culture. Like,
295920	302480	I don't really, despite being a dual citizen, just like in terms of formally, I don't really
302480	306880	think of myself as like a Sri Lankan Australian, or, you know, it's not something I attach myself
306960	314160	to too much. Certainly, my home is Australia, but yeah, don't get me wrong. I'm not like a hippie
314160	318160	that's like, oh, I'm a globalist. No, we need a home. I think, you know, we need a place that we
318160	328640	call home. But I guess to be succinct, I try to not think too much about, like, which culture am
328640	335440	I a part of? What's like my true, unique, you know, authentic culture? Because, as I think
335760	340880	Jacques puts as well, cultures themselves aren't authentic in themselves. They themselves have
340880	348000	this like, sure, ontological incompleteness, let's say. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes people go after
348000	355200	having a culture, they turn that into a project, expecting it to provide them with something,
355200	361760	something very stable and final, and help them get rid of that sense of alienation once and for
362320	367200	all. Yeah, yeah. If we turn that into that kind of turn it into that kind of project,
367200	373200	I think that would be disappointing, ultimately. Yeah, because unfortunately, I don't know what
373200	378160	your thoughts on this, David, especially given you're much closer to the US than I am. I mean,
378160	383200	there's a there's a rise in nationalism, right? And I think a lot of them are looking for this,
383840	390720	the big other, the stable big other, and they want to fully attach themselves with it. And then
390720	398160	it's from there, they have this like, sense of stability, which, at least since modernity,
398160	404880	subjects have never had in the world. We like, Todd McGovern says that kind of the one sign of
404880	409680	modernity is that all subjects are alienated. We don't have a home in some sense. None of us
409680	417360	are rooted in a home. But yeah, I think I mean, Todd McGovern, I mean, I like him a lot, but what
417360	423840	does he know about being really alienated, living in a living in a place that nobody speaks his
423840	429440	language? I mean, sure, theoretically, I follow him to I follow him to but there's there are different
429440	437040	degrees of being out of place. Some of them are more visceral. I agree. Some of them are more like
437040	444400	you have to really think your way to them. But to be in a place and everybody's pointing at you
444400	449440	and saying, Oh, look at the foreigner, or is that is that foreigner going to stay here with us?
449440	456640	Yeah, that's that's like very in your face. And I since I've experienced that, I mean, that's
457440	463360	maybe that's not exactly what he's talking about. But maybe it is maybe it's like, you know,
465040	468480	I think I totally get your point there. Because like, I remember when I came here, when I was a
468480	474880	kid, much younger, even things like, I mean, I think Canada is okay. But like a lot like
474880	479600	Australian slang and colloquialisms, I was kind of like, what the hell are people talking about?
479600	485840	You know, and like, it's not even the direct judgment or the gaze of the others, just generally
485840	492800	me, myself, I'm trying to see where the hell do I fit in here. And then what I even the reason
492800	497200	Todd McGovern's work was really helpful was to be honest, I agree with you, I think there are like
497200	503280	certain limits, there's like, like, there are like, some of it can be a lot more palpable and
503280	509440	visceral was that because I realized, Oh, the trick is to kind of embrace your alienation to not like
510080	514960	to not as a not I don't try to this used to be the case where I tried to like overly attach
514960	519120	myself with a certain culture, be the Australian culture or the Sri Lankan culture, which is the
519120	523760	culture that my, you know, I was born and raised in. But I realized no, no, no, that's all of that
523760	529600	is fine. Like, I'm not, I'm not going to actively negate that side of me, of course, not that's
529600	536160	impossible. But also, I won't overly attach myself and be like, Oh, this is why I'm this is a true
536160	542480	core of my being. I like the whole kind of idea that in some sense, at the core, what we are is
542480	548000	like this kind of abyss or like a void. At least for me, being again, being a migrant, probably
548000	552400	that that's probably the reason I like that idea a lot more than trying to find like an
552480	558400	authentic kernel of who I am as a as a subject. Right, I see, I see. I feel like this is this
558400	562800	can be a this can be a long conversation, an ongoing conversation. Yeah, we can definitely
562800	570320	talk about this. Hopefully, we will be on with this. But I can, I can see how that could connect
570320	577600	to your interest in cognitive science as well, because that's tacitly cognitive science has that
577600	584400	attitude of not too much being attached to any particular culture. Interesting, what sense would
584400	590080	you say? It's a very non-culture in general, I think cognitive science, cognitive psychology has
590080	597840	a very non-cultural view of human nature, of a human being and human thinking. It kind of
598480	605920	brackets out the idiosyncratic, local, you know, regional practices, regional, I mean,
605920	615360	idioms of language. Everything becomes neat and formulaic and trans, maybe because you say
615360	623600	transparent, not these like interpretive, indirect, you know, a cognitive psychologist or
623840	634320	cognitive scientist doesn't necessarily, doesn't, I mean, habitually or typically pick out these
634960	641600	indirect communications, communication practices of cultures where you have to be immersed in a
641600	649680	culture to know how to decode a given sign, you know, that's what I mean. I see, I see, like it
649680	655920	tries to be like trans-cultural in some sense. Yes, yes, or beyond cultures. Yeah, no, I think
655920	662800	you're right, because like, in fact, I'm going to start my master's program next year, and it's
662800	670320	partially in cognitive science, like it's a research program. And I think I'm more, let's say,
670320	676800	I find more affinity with those kinds of studies, because something that also bothers me at the
676800	680960	Buddhist is kind of like, sometimes people get into this, like, they focus too much on, like,
680960	686000	the particularities, like other feminists or Marxists or black or white, and at one point,
686000	690240	that's very exhausting, you know, it's like, yeah, I get it, we all have particular identities,
690240	696240	but what about the universal? And that's why I'm more caught up in, like, I like the sciences,
696240	700240	because there is this kind of universalistic with that has its negatives too, for sure,
700240	705680	it's very absolutist. But I prefer that, I think you hit the nail on the head, that idea that
706240	709360	we can go beyond the particular into something a bit more universal.
712000	716000	Yeah, what you said partly is cognitive science. The other part, is it philosophy?
716000	718240	It's philosophy, that's correct. Yeah, yeah. Okay, nice.
718240	722880	One by the department, but they have like, it's a very interesting program, like they,
723440	729040	they kind of intend them with some cognitive science fields. So I'm looking forward to it.
729040	735440	You're going for it. Yeah, man. I'm like, I, I, I kind of want to do what you did, you know,
735440	740560	go through the whole process, get my PhD, and then who knows, it might end up becoming a but not
740560	749120	academic, but I'm going to do it, regardless. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Good luck. Thank you, man. Thank
749120	754800	you. I might, in fact, I might come to you in the future for some advice. I hope I can.
757920	763440	No, I'd always be appreciative of that. But yeah, as I said, David, sorry for my, you know,
763440	768320	raspy voice. I'm getting over a cold. I'm telling you it's not. You sound, you sound fine. You sound
768320	774800	great. Perfect. Thank you, man. Yeah, look, so what we kind of are hoping to do today is to discuss
775360	781280	Bianchel Han's work and sort of let's do it in some sense, the propagandize as to why you should
781280	787680	read Bianchel Han. But before that, David, I thought a rather pertinent question would be,
788080	795200	my God, you've got over 400, I think, book reviews, probably a couple hundred on our YouTube channel,
796000	803680	and you're an avid reader. And from different genres, certainly. But I want to ask you a question,
803680	812400	which I think a lot of ink has been spilt over, which is how does one read philosophy and theory
812400	825040	well? You know, Rahul, in general, I am, I find it very difficult to adopt that perspective,
825040	830800	adopt that position of how does one do this and that. I know it's very attractive to go
830800	839120	for that perspective and formulate a kind of advice, generalities, general guidelines.
840080	846160	I can talk, I find it easier to talk about the things that I have,
848560	855280	I have kind of slowly settled into the kind of perspective I've settled into and maybe the
855280	861360	what I would say to myself, to my past self, maybe 10 years ago. In fact, in fact, I know
861360	865680	that you're not the advice giving type in any way, but perhaps that's a better way to
865680	873200	say what would you say to your past self. But there is that, that temptation to give advice
873200	878480	and ask for advice, both are very strong. And it's the, it's a temptation to be, to take a,
879920	886000	to, to help the other person save some time. You know, I really want other people to not go
886000	892000	through this inefficient process that I went through. But that's my mistake when I give to
892000	897600	that, give into that temptation, because everybody needs to go through their own inefficient process,
897600	902640	their own inefficient journeys, they own, they own, they own set of wrong books, the books that
902640	910400	they will later be embarrassed to admit that they liked, they enjoyed. Okay, so back to the question,
910400	917840	see if I can retrieve it, if I can remember it. How does one read philosophy? I mean, literally.
922160	931760	Slowly, you know, slowly without rush, trying to not do too much. I always have this. I mean,
931760	938240	I had it more, like, I just as to pick one example, the person that you read, one of the people you
938240	946400	recently interviewed that I really admire, Simon Krishly. I have, when I become interested in somebody
946400	952160	like, let's say Krishly, I was like, okay, here's a list of all Simon Krishly books. I'm going to
952160	958240	start chronologically from beginning to the end, and read them all. And see, read all the other
958240	963600	people that he was influenced by. And okay, if I replicate that whole process, what's going to
963600	969600	happen? I will catch up to Simon Krishly. Okay, that's like, by that time, I'm like seven years
969600	976400	old or something, or something, some age like that. I've tried to replicate Simon Krishly's
976400	983280	reading and writing life. I mean, that's not a practical thing to do. And I don't think it's
983280	992000	very useful. It's better to be, to accept that maybe I'll read one or two books by this thinker.
992800	996960	And by the time I'm finished with the second book, maybe I'm too busy with some of their
996960	1001520	projects, some of the tasks, maybe my life will be interrupted by some facts of life,
1002240	1011040	maybe ill health or, you know, losing a job or whatever. And then, when I get back to philosophy,
1011040	1016480	I'm interested in some other topic or some other, some other thinker. So embracing all those
1016480	1023040	limitations, all those, the negativity of the reading life, to borrow Byung-chohan's
1023760	1030640	and others, Byung-chohan really brought this back and urged us to think in terms of negativity,
1030640	1038240	to embrace that. All those features that are negative, you know, lack of speed. I'm not
1038240	1042960	going to be as fast as I want to be. I'm not going to read as exhaustively as I want to be.
1042960	1050480	I'm not going to remember as much as I want to remember, you know, so often I read again a text,
1050480	1056720	it's like, oh, I can't believe I read this before. This is so fresh. This is so new. And
1057840	1062240	there's this other kind of experience that you feel like I was never in a position to really
1062240	1067920	appreciate this text until now. The passage by Nietzsche, you know, it was just after reading
1067920	1073360	maybe something by Freud, and he returned to a passage, a paragraph from Beyond Good and Evil,
1073360	1080880	and you realize, oh my god, what did I read before? I totally missed this. So sorry to
1080880	1086960	give a long answer to that. No, that's a great question. I really liked the last point because
1086960	1093520	I think in a conversation you had with Daniel Ghana, you know, OG Rose, they're lovely. I want to
1093520	1099200	speak to them soon, but I want to first read that book before I have them on. He said a similar
1099200	1104080	thing where, especially Nietzsche, because it's very aphoristic, so you'd read a bit of Nietzsche,
1104960	1109520	and then you come back to him, let's say, two, three years later, and it's like a totally different
1109520	1118080	author, you know, a totally different book in some sense. Yeah, I think for me, I see this,
1118080	1121760	probably it's more for your temperament, because you're a bit of a calmer person,
1121760	1127520	because I'm a bit of a neurotic person, and I like action, you know, like I'm a typical what
1127520	1134320	we call this burnout subject in some sense, you know, like I like this kind of making, you know,
1134320	1141120	Björn Scholland talks about making yourself into a project. You make yourself into like an
1141120	1149200	entrepreneur of the self, right? And therefore, a part of me does like that because I enjoy it,
1149200	1154320	but also the problem with that is I don't appreciate, as you pointed out, the slowness
1155040	1159200	and like having the patience and even like that negativity where you detach yourself
1160000	1167840	from this, let's call it noise or the hyperpositivity, and just sit with an idea. If it's for hours,
1167840	1173360	if it's just like a verse or an excerpt from a book, hours and even days, and just like kind of
1173360	1179280	meditating on it. And I found that that can be a lot more valuable than trying to read 60 pages
1179280	1188240	in a day or try to like hit some reading quota or be it may. Yeah, yeah, I'm, you know, the older
1188240	1193760	I get, the less I can relate to those things like reading quota, like read 200 pages a day.
1194800	1204320	Why? For what purpose? Because the ultimate, the ultimate effect of these reading life is
1204320	1211200	you want the effect to show up when, for example, you are talking to a kid that's like a nine year
1211200	1218400	old, eight year old kid. That's where, you know, it's a critical moment where you want to behave
1219200	1226160	somewhat wisely when there is a sensitive person who is listening to you or you're dealing with
1226160	1232960	somebody. And if you're reading 200 pages a day, you're exhausting yourself and you're
1232960	1238320	very impatient probably when you, when you meet that, you know, kid or student or a person who is
1239360	1247040	really receptive to you, open to you at that moment. I think we should keep an eye out for,
1247040	1254000	for those moments where we want the impact of our reading life to, to show up. You know what I mean?
1255440	1261040	Because it's, it's all for something, you know, it's, it's supposed to be for something and that
1261040	1267920	something is, there are very limited chance moments, there are very limited moments of our
1267920	1275600	lives where you want to be like, I try to be a somewhat decent person and reading is, is hopefully
1275600	1282800	part of that. Interesting. So for you, you always see reading as a, as a, to put it crassly as like a
1282800	1290480	means to an end. Because for me personally, I find that I read for its own sake, like I don't
1290480	1296880	expect anything out of it. Well, some, some books I do, especially if it's like preparing for like
1296880	1303280	my studies or the podcast, but some other books, I read them for their own sake. That's a good point.
1304320	1310640	You want to read for its own sake, but not purely. I mean, there's, there's a limit to that
1311600	1318640	because sometimes it's work. Sometimes it's, it doesn't seem like you're doing it for its own
1318640	1325840	sake because you're putting the, putting extra effort in. But yeah, that's why I kind of reach out
1326480	1331520	for some purpose, some other thing out, outside of the intrinsic enjoyment. But yeah, I relate to
1332320	1335760	reading for its own sake too, as something that is otherwise.
1336240	1340000	Yeah. Now, I certainly see that because like, especially, you know, this is a beautiful thing
1340000	1346320	about with all of its discontents, the internet and this kind of new podcasting, whatever you
1346320	1355280	may call it, book, booktube, a community that's being built up. It's like given life of the mind
1355280	1360640	or reading to use a bit of a pretentious term can be a, you know, very solitary thing. It's just
1360640	1366080	lovely to see people that are, that truly cherish it, cherish it as much as we do. And we connect
1366080	1370720	with them through the internet. And that, that for me, despite growing up with the internet,
1370720	1376160	I've never gotten over the fact that you could just like you're in Canada and I'm here in Australia
1376160	1383360	and we both connect over this shared love for, for reading and learning. I'll never, you know,
1383360	1388720	get over that fact, that datum, you know? Sure, sure. But you know, there are all these people
1388720	1396640	who cherish reading, but they show the cherishing moments when they turn on the camera, they say
1396640	1401920	how much they cherish that, the activity of reading, but the camera is off most of the time and they
1401920	1407280	don't always cherish it. I mean, we don't, I don't, I don't always enjoy reading and I don't, I don't
1407280	1414800	have a very simple, always filled with pleasure relationship with reading. Interesting. To me,
1414800	1419840	life of the mind is, is full of suffering and uncertainty. It's a struggle to struggle. I
1419840	1424880	agree. I mean, I joke around, I joke around. I say that I'm probably a bit of like a masochist,
1424880	1428800	because it's such a struggle to like, I mean, try to read like Hegel, right? I'm like, God,
1428800	1432880	well, what the hell is this guy talking about? And I, or like, like corn, for instance, and then
1432880	1439920	it's like, what, but nonetheless, you persevere. And it's never like a walk in the park and like
1439920	1444240	a very pleasant experience. It's a struggle for sure that I agree. I couldn't agree more with that.
1444240	1452960	Yeah. All right, David. So Bianchel Han, getting back to Bianchel Han. What, what, you know,
1452960	1459200	especially being a cognitive psychologist, what would you say, what firstly attracted his work,
1459200	1466560	because he's a critical theorist after all, what attracted you towards his work, but also what
1467920	1473600	isomorphism similarities do you see between cognitive psychology and the work of Bianchel
1473600	1484640	Han? Oh, I, let's first talk about how I got into his work. So I, and it was by accident.
1485440	1493280	I have a friend who is here in Toronto, and he gave me a copy of The Agony of El Ros.
1494720	1503520	And I noticed the kind of book it is first, I noticed, yeah, it's very short. It's, you know,
1504000	1511760	50 something pages, I think 53 pages, excluding the notes. And I didn't read it immediately. I just
1511760	1515680	read a couple of pages and I said, okay, I know, I know what the kind of thing that he's writing
1515680	1525840	about. And three, four years later, I kept running into Han's work in bookstores. And I said, okay,
1525840	1530480	I'm going to do that thing. I'm going to chronologically read his work beginning with the
1530480	1542320	first burnout society. And so I started. And yeah, that's, that was my entry. I don't want to,
1542320	1547600	you know, you asked about the relationship or possible relationships between cognitive science
1547600	1555600	and Han. And this is difficult for me to say, given that you, you have this exciting project of
1555600	1562400	going into cognitive science now. So I don't kind of, I'm hesitant to say this, but for me,
1563360	1566480	let's say my own particular relationship with cognitive science, I don't have a very
1566480	1574960	high opinion of it. So I would say, for me, becoming increasingly critical of cognitive
1574960	1580560	psychology, the experimental method as applied to the study of human beings.
1581520	1588000	Han became, eventually, he became one of the resources for me to think about
1589360	1596960	the conduct of psychologists, my colleagues in academia. So when he talked about, you know,
1596960	1605840	the shrinking of time, we don't have this long view or relationship with time as something
1606400	1614240	that can linger, that continues, that covers a long span, that our form of consciousness
1614240	1618000	is structured such that time is very brief for us, that we have this
1621280	1629680	more metaphorically, at least ADHD-like kind of subjectivity, where at any given moment,
1629680	1635280	we want to say wow and be surprised and be impressed by a research project in cognitive
1635280	1641120	psychology. I felt like every meeting, every kind of departmental presentation, it started
1641120	1648560	from scratch, no history, no memory, a quick presentation and a quick wow. And soon after
1648560	1654400	it was done, that's it, it was gone. So you become like, it becomes a piece of entertainment and a
1654400	1663200	piece of, you know, easy, quick persuasion. And if you look back, there's not much relationship
1663200	1669760	between different projects that people are pursuing. And so when I read and thought with Han, I became
1670640	1677360	kind of aware of this, this thing that was my career, this is just one expression of
1677360	1686000	something bigger that Han is talking about, namely the neoliberal order, the neoliberal subject of
1687040	1693280	which, you know, one way it shows up is in research, research projects, projects, you know,
1693280	1701360	in general, projects. Yeah, in fact, I recall in one of the videos, I think the one you made on
1702240	1709040	Psychopolitics, you even mentioned that in academics, like, because again, we're all part of the old
1709040	1715600	immersed in the neoliberal symbolic order, let's say, right? And academics constantly love coming
1715600	1721760	up with new terms, new words, new ideas, it's a novelty, you know, we fetishize novelty.
1722400	1729840	And that is because we have this kind of almost imperative to create, to produce.
1730720	1734320	Yeah, you gotta have a thing, academia, you gotta have your thing. Exactly. Yeah.
1735200	1739120	That's fascinating. That's fascinating. But first of all, David, I want to say I really do,
1739120	1744160	that means a lot to me that you took my personal career into into account when
1744160	1750400	replying to that, because I mean, look, I, it's interesting. I know the, I've spoken to many
1750400	1755760	people like yourself, who are academics, who've been through this journey. And I know it's,
1755760	1760720	it's, it certainly has its own problems too, you know, university itself, the neoliberal
1760720	1768560	university has its shortcomings. And in fact, perhaps it's, it's, it's becoming another corporation,
1768560	1774000	unfortunately, like, like, what we see in the rest of society. So I mean, in fact, you're gonna
1774000	1779840	Yeah, please. But I would never discourage you to, I would never discourage you from pursuing
1780640	1786560	that way of life, because the problems that we attribute to university life
1787280	1792080	are not unique to it. Indeed. We become, we become disappointed. Yeah, we become
1792080	1798160	disappointed and disillusioned to find that university is not special, that it also has
1798880	1803360	all those problems that we find in the corporate world, for example.
1804080	1810720	So that's, I mean, there, there are still a lot of good things about having, having a life in
1810720	1817440	university, you know, teaching and thinking and writing. It's still, there's still a lot of good
1817440	1827600	in it. I should emphasize that for me, after, you know, six years, plus the PhD, getting the PhD,
1828400	1834400	getting the PhD, that was another five years, postdoc one year. So about 11 years after about
1834400	1840720	11 years, I realized, you know, I had enough of this. I want to do something else. I want to
1840720	1846960	create something else. And I, it really became a question for me, like, if I don't do this,
1846960	1853600	what would my life be like? What else could it be? So it was, I needed to
1853680	1861200	become independent of this thing that I, I continuously criticized, because you can't,
1862160	1867440	I mean, I, in good conscience, can't continue to criticize something while depending on it,
1867440	1874480	still, while still getting my salary from it and say, Oh, I hate this. So, so I wanted to live
1875200	1882320	with more integrity. So you know what, I'm going to put my money where my mouth is, or I want to,
1882400	1888640	you know, I want to really, like, really mean this. I mean this critique. I mean it enough to say,
1889440	1895600	I don't want to devote my life to it anymore. Well, in fact, let's, let's go here. Let's go a bit,
1895600	1900320	delve a bit deeper into this, because, you know, let's, let's bring in the actual hands, you know,
1900320	1904320	psychopolitics, excellent book, kind of he, you know, critiques, neoliberalism. So
1905120	1911760	in the context of academia and the university, David, what would you say in your view is like
1911760	1915920	the ideal, like the platonic idea, whatever you mean, called the ideal of the university?
1916720	1924240	And then what is the current in actuality of the university we have in, let's say, most of the
1924240	1934240	world, which people like the actual hand are critical of? Wow, that's a very difficult question. I,
1935200	1942160	you know, we have to, that probably deserves a kind of round table discussion with a lot of people
1942800	1951040	for me and help getting to that ideal, unpacking that really. But just let's say that for me,
1951600	1959360	the idea, the ideal of university is not separable from the type of person that
1960160	1972080	it's supposed to cultivate, a form of life, a form of life that is thoughtful, that is interested,
1972080	1981200	that is open to a certain kind of wonder, a certain kind of openness,
1981680	1990720	and keeps a certain mindset alive, keeps a certain spirit alive, spirit of inquiry.
1992320	2000400	So it's a form of being that university is the platform, it's the medium for that form of life.
2000400	2006000	So a lot is probably required for that. A lot of practices, a lot of support
2006880	2013280	goes into that structure. So it's a structure, a place where, you know, a certain form of life can
2013280	2024080	be supported. Right now is what we can say about university, how it deviates, is that people still,
2024080	2029280	I think people still have that in the back of their mind when they do their works. But
2030240	2037040	that ideal is something that is perpetually postponed. They will say things like, okay,
2037040	2043680	this year I need to get these publications out. They're not important, I don't really believe in them.
2046000	2053440	But I need to publish these couple of papers to get the promotion. And after that,
2054320	2061360	I can focus on what I really want. But this thing, if you pay it, if you keep listening to people,
2061360	2068960	if you keep paying attention, you hear the repetition of this pattern, that it's always later.
2069840	2074480	And ultimately, it's after they retire that they want to do the thing that they want to do.
2074480	2079760	They say typically in psychology was, people would say, I want to study consciousness after
2079760	2086400	I retire. That's a typical thing. Although they get tenure, now that's stability.
2087200	2094320	Yeah, tenure. But in some cases, even tenure is not enough. Because the department sometimes
2094320	2099760	turns against you if you do what you like to do after you get tenure, because they say,
2099760	2102720	we hired you to do this type of research, why did you stop?
2103040	2115200	Yeah, it becomes, I mean, deviation from the ideal, I would say, happens when it becomes
2115200	2119840	about performance and metrics, and the signs of accomplishment, the signs of success.
2121360	2124400	Yeah, and then in fact, perhaps you could connect us to that idea that
2125360	2133600	Björn Schullhand talks about his critique of big data. This goes really well again with
2133600	2139760	your previous point. It's about positivity, right? It's a measure, everything is,
2140480	2147760	you become another statistic, you put it in like a very cliched way. Whereas as something in thought,
2147760	2153920	and in fact, he says it's theory, that it's a negativity. There's no, it's not a positive thing,
2154000	2158240	you kind of remove yourself from being, and it's a different kind of mode of being.
2160800	2168800	Yeah, remember, when big data was very hot and new, you probably remember this, there were these
2168800	2177760	statements like, now we have so much data, that the need to think isn't, we don't have that need
2177760	2184640	anymore. We don't have the need, people said that there was a statement about we don't need to think
2184640	2189360	anymore, and we don't need theory anymore. That definitely, I remember that hearing that, reading
2189360	2197120	that. All those things that we really want to become, to cultivate the capacity for those things,
2197120	2204800	capacity for thought, capacity for theory, these serious consideration of this upper topic or
2204800	2212000	subject matter, that requires lack and requires negativity, and also that having a relationship
2212000	2219280	with negativity. Big data, the way people think of it as like, providing us too much, more than we
2219280	2228320	need, we get so much that you almost become like, helpless, like you can't, it's not up to you anymore
2228720	2236880	after crossing some threshold. It's not up to us, we just submit to it, we submit to the big data.
2238240	2245440	Yeah, I mean, perhaps, I'd say for me, the almost quintessential example of this is health and fitness,
2245440	2249280	you probably noticed that people have the watch where they track their steps,
2249840	2254480	they track their sleep, they got the ring to, I think, track their pulse heartbeat. I mean,
2255440	2262960	you know, you completely mechanize the human body to a point where I think in my view,
2262960	2270080	it ends up, it ends up harming you because you know, you burn out from that kind of like, you get
2270080	2277680	fatigued from this constantly having to, you know, measure yourself. In fact, a funny anecdote,
2277680	2282480	one of my friends, I'm not going to mention her name obviously, she even has like a,
2283360	2289280	almost like a Trello boat or like a project management, like a software she uses to keep
2289280	2296640	track of her dating, her dates. So like, this person has these pros, these cons, and she's a
2296640	2302880	lovely person, we get along really well, but, and we're quite close. So I always kind of make
2302880	2307200	fun of her for this, you know, do you, do you keep track of like, how many times you had sex per
2307200	2313120	week and everything? And I'm like, I even tell her personally, for me, if I live like that,
2313120	2317120	I'd probably end up killing myself. I mean, I can't think of anything more depressing than
2317120	2322960	having to track everything in that sense and making yourself a part of this big data ideology,
2322960	2329840	let's say. Yeah, that's, that's very interesting. I haven't heard of anybody doing that, but
2330640	2335200	we should still ask like, what is that tracking doing? It might not be doing what it might,
2335200	2341760	what it would do for us. Maybe for some people, it just creates that, the sense of stability and
2341760	2348160	that, you know, it might not result in anything, it might not lead anywhere, these dates that I'm
2348160	2354480	going, but at least I have this, the records of it. Yeah, for some people, that could be, you know,
2354480	2364240	they could write a novel about that. Maybe that's similar to like a technological record keeping.
2365760	2370000	Yeah, I think a lot of it has to do with this. This, this, I mean, in fact, let me read out this
2370000	2378320	quote, David, I was gonna, this idea where there's this lovely thing where it says, so the achievement
2378320	2384640	subject, this is from the Bernard Society, Björn Chaland says, the achievement subject explodes
2384640	2393920	itself until it burns out. In the process, it develops auto aggression that often enough,
2394480	2401760	escalates into the violence of self destruction. The project turns out to be a projectile that
2401760	2407600	the achievement subject is aiming at itself. And I think for me, this goes back to the idea that
2407600	2412320	everything has to be a project, right, including academia. And then, and then the problem is,
2412320	2418560	and just to kind of get at this bit, but like high level, in the book, he talks about how in
2419520	2425840	disciplinary society, kind of what Foucault critiques, the, it's, it's still a society of
2425840	2431040	prohibition, right, you do, thou shall not, you shall not have sex before marriage, you shall not,
2431040	2435680	if you're, you know, gay marriage is illegal, whatever you may call it. Whereas in our society,
2435680	2441200	in the society of the hyper positivity, we achievement subjects, everything is, yes,
2441200	2448080	you can, yes, you should. And in that sense, I think we, we, we all of us, all of us, this is,
2448080	2453680	in no way am I like sitting on like high chair, like pointing fingers, we all do this. I know I
2453680	2460000	do this. We make projects out of our life and we ourselves become a project. So, and I think
2460000	2466160	Han puts it beautifully, we exploit ourselves. And to get back to this thing about what you said
2466160	2471600	about stability, I think there is, there is this idea at least in my view that this is feeling,
2472560	2478000	you do get some kind of safety when you feel like everything is tracked, everything is in order,
2479040	2485120	you know, everything, everything has a place, everything makes sense. Now, we don't know in
2485120	2491360	reality if that stability exists, but at least the, the ideology is, yes, my, my romantic life,
2491360	2496880	I can plan it out. I know, I'll know exactly who I'll meet, the kind of person I want, or the tick
2496880	2504560	all the boxes. And of course, in, at least in my view, what happens there is we are always,
2504560	2510320	we're always surprised. In fact, I'd argue the paradoxes, the more you try to order your life,
2510320	2518720	the more control you lose. Right, right. It just also occurred to me that that, that's the closer
2518720	2524560	to the transparency society to, to keep records of everything. You're making your dating life
2524560	2531760	transparent to yourself, to yourself and potentially to other spectators, that this is what I'm
2531760	2536800	doing and I'm recording everything here. And the other thing that happens with that is everything
2536800	2543920	becomes the same because person number one and person number seven, because you kept track of them
2544800	2550720	with respect to similar dimensions, they are comparable, they all become comparable. And the
2550720	2559680	otherness about them, their alterity is pushed aside. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Could you elaborate on
2559680	2565840	that point? I'm so glad you brought that up. The idea of otherness and alterity, how that,
2566480	2572720	how that's a part of our subjectivity in some sense. Yeah, so I think that's, I mean, by,
2573920	2579440	by definition, that's a difficult concept to articulate because it's always what we call
2580160	2590880	the other, truly other is always the thing that is not captured by the logic of our current project.
2592800	2597120	Whatever that is not that you're not capable of because of the way we have positioned ourselves,
2597120	2605360	the kind of structure that you're participating in. By virtue of that, the other is outside of
2605360	2615760	that, and we are not ready to even understand it. What we can do is to be, we could say vulnerable
2615760	2624480	to it, we could become vulnerable to its effects, like having an argument with, with, you know,
2624480	2631600	with our significant other, having something that a disagreement that seems irreconcilable,
2632320	2637200	or having a problem with a stranger and not even knowing what the root of the problem is.
2639840	2649200	So Han, identity, he argues that we are inclined to move in the direction of sameness,
2649760	2657520	the tyranny or the terror of sameness to impose structures and logic, kinds of logic,
2657520	2665840	when we deal with different kinds of situations, impose kinds of logic that simplifies what we
2665840	2673360	are encountering and treats plurality in terms of same, so same kinds of stuff. So in dating,
2673360	2680400	for example, the example, very useful, we just number people or the books, you know,
2680400	2685040	hundred classics that you should read before you die, you know, that's like, that's also a kind
2685040	2692080	of unfair way of treating books because, you know, you want to hundreds and one is probably the best,
2692080	2698400	hundred is like, yeah, okay, you can skip that. But the logic of sameness is imposed on that,
2698400	2705520	on that list, you know, it turned the thing turns into a list. So it's, it's very interesting by,
2705520	2711680	by getting out of that, funny enough, the effect of that is the kind of liberation,
2711760	2718160	you liberate ourselves by getting out of the logic of sameness. Indeed. And the detail of that,
2719600	2726320	the detail of that is in a book that I haven't yet finished by Han is the expulsion of the other.
2726960	2736320	But just like any, any of his books, it's great by really continuing and, and
2736560	2743840	and illuminating what he has done in the previous books. So, for example, you just touched on the
2743840	2750800	burnout society. And he, he says this, he makes this really beautiful, very insightful observation
2751440	2757600	that, you know, he's talking about the new liberal regime and self exploitation. Okay.
2758160	2763040	But we perceive that self exploitation as freedom and we are, we think that we are self
2763600	2771760	optimizing, self realizing. And he writes here, there is no other as exploiter to the,
2771760	2775760	the exploiter is not another forcing me to work and alienating me from myself. Rather,
2775760	2781680	I voluntarily exploit myself in the belief that I am realizing myself. This is the diabolical
2781680	2788560	logic of neoliberalism. And then he writes, hence the first stage of a burnout is euphoria.
2789520	2793280	The first stage of burnout is euphoria. You're happy in the beginning.
2794880	2802800	I plunge into work euphorically until I finally collapse. This is, this is really,
2803600	2810640	it's a transferable insight. You might think about this type, there's a type of person who
2812080	2817680	gets in and out of relationships, and they get really passionate. When they start a relationship,
2817680	2825120	they get this euphoria of, I finally find, found the one. And of course, these problems,
2825120	2830960	they're waiting. The problems are brewing from the very beginning. It's not that something goes
2830960	2836640	wrong. No, the very structure from the very beginning is set up for that huge, heated
2836640	2844640	disappointment to happen and for the explosion, for a breakup to happen explosively. So this
2845600	2852640	is now in here, in this passage, Han is describing burnout as something that
2853600	2860240	we set ourselves up for from the very beginning, when we euphorically start engaging with the project.
2862560	2868160	Indeed, like the absolute high and then the complete destruction, isn't it, that comes along
2868160	2872640	with it? Yeah. Yes, they're part of the same, they're part of the same pattern.
2873200	2878880	Yeah, because we set it up through this kind of, let's call it within our society, kind of what
2878880	2885680	the ideology we hold, hold dear to us. And two points on that, David, one other really good
2885680	2892000	example you used to this kind of the massification of like sameness is traveling. I remember you,
2892000	2897920	I think you used it in one of your videos. And look, I'm not again anti-traveling, I'll be going
2898000	2904640	on a holiday next month, in fact, but I am very, very critical and I even find it, I'm a bit even,
2904640	2910720	I even detest this idea that, you know, I got to tick all the boxes every single city of Paris
2910720	2916560	or Florence or Berlin or and go to Europe, especially, you know, because us Australians here,
2916560	2921920	we're quite away from Europe. So love going to Europe. And then the point you make is that it's
2921920	2926880	kind of cheap and you go to Paris, you stay there for four days and you're like, I know Paris,
2927520	2933040	you know, but of course, that's not how you get to know a city. And then that same ideology,
2933840	2939360	it comes along to other human beings too, you know, you start viewing even humans,
2940080	2943440	it's just another person, just another city, just another commodity.
2943440	2950400	Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of, it's almost tragic that we get very close to getting somewhere,
2950400	2954560	you know, when you travel, when you go to Paris, you just get so, it's such an opportunity.
2954560	2962160	It's an amazing city, amazing history. You go there and then people miss it.
2962160	2965920	People miss the fact that it's supposed to be enjoyed, it's supposed to be an experience,
2965920	2972000	you're supposed to be surprised. And maybe you go through the Paris syndrome, that's another
2972000	2979600	whole thing. But to what I noticed, unfortunately, the tragedy is that for, for people, for some
2979600	2987440	people, it becomes about taking photos and then it doesn't become enjoyable until the moment they
2987440	2993600	are back and they show those pictures to their friends. That's when they start enjoying it.
2994240	2999920	I mean, that's just, I mean, that's kind of, that's a kind of sickness, isn't it?
2999920	3003680	It is a kind of sickness, but also I think it's, you know, in the Transparency Society,
3003760	3009760	he has a one essay called the Society of Exhibition, where you've got to exhibit your,
3010480	3015120	it's like, until you got the approval from the other, in this case, the gaze of the social
3015120	3020640	media, it's as if you haven't really done this thing. You know, and I think
3022320	3028960	he says, the Society of Exhibition is a society of pornography, that kind of hyper unconcealment.
3028960	3035680	I really do like that because it's like, it's as if we want to get rid of this friction
3036320	3042480	between us and the world. We want it to be completely seamless and there's no, it's just
3042480	3046960	whatever it's in here, it has to be out there. Whereas for me, the subject, what's really
3046960	3051680	fascinating, and I think Jijek gets this point quite well, is that we are a complete fisher in
3051680	3058000	being, we're, it's this absolute negativity that that kind of, we kind of, in many ways, we don't
3058080	3062640	fit into the subject, doesn't fit into the order of things because of this absolute negativity
3062640	3069440	that that's created. And with this need to be completely transparent, we completely
3072320	3079120	jettison this negativity. Right. And that's where for me, traveling, because, you know,
3079120	3083920	if you think about it, I am all about, in some sense, I'm like a levinazi and like, I really
3083920	3089840	believe in exposing yourself and opening yourself to the other. And travel, you could argue, is a
3089840	3093920	beautiful way to do that, you know, opening yourself to just a completely different culture,
3095040	3102480	a different mode of being even. But if it becomes kind of like the whole, it's just going to become a
3102480	3107600	game for, you know, Instagram selfies. So it was put up on the internet. There's no, there's absolutely
3107600	3113200	no opening yourself to the other. It's just simply another exhibition. It's another, yeah,
3113200	3120320	another box to take. Yeah, yeah. All the inconveniences of traveling and people,
3120960	3126800	the parts that we are inclined to not appreciate, I mean, those are the real, those are when those
3126800	3138080	are the moments where we encounter what is not planned, what is the real justification for
3138080	3144400	getting out, getting, getting into the, indeed, into the journey. Just, it's a really good point
3144400	3148880	you make about the inconvenience, because I know you've been on Kareel Last, the philosophy
3148880	3155760	portal, his podcast, love his work. I mean, I feel like the, I'm hoping to talk to him one day.
3155760	3160080	I'm probably going to have like one of those moments, because he was one of the first people
3160080	3166160	that I, his channel was the resource for me to understand, you know, probably five years ago.
3166240	3172160	I went through his lectures and then Hegel and he's an amazing, amazing elucidator. But anyway,
3172160	3176800	leaving that aside, he has this point about inconvenience. He says that, you know, we,
3177440	3181280	we have these kinds of conversations online and it's fantastic. Like it's just,
3182000	3187360	it's like an oasis of where we could just get lost in this world of thinking and theory and
3187360	3193280	philosophy. But he does say there is something very convenient about this, right? As in, let's
3193280	3199200	say David, you and I, we wanted to have the same conversation in person. You're in Canada, I'm in
3199200	3205200	Australia. We may have to organize our flights, take up a lot of time from our day and there's
3205200	3212160	like a lot of friction for us to have this in person. But now all I had to do was just, I mean,
3212160	3216880	I sent you an email and a bit of back and forth, but that's nothing compared to, and then, you know,
3216880	3222000	click a button, zoom video opens up. All of that friction is taken away. And I wonder
3222720	3229280	if there will be some kind of richness that comes out of this friction, if it is in person
3229920	3234720	and how it's in the future of like this kind of what we're doing in this community, how that
3234720	3239760	would be where I'm, I'm trying to see as I grow this community, if I can do a bit, a few more
3239760	3247440	in person events in Australia, just so that there's something, the difficulty of that itself
3247440	3252400	makes it worth it, if I could put it that way. Yeah, that's a great idea to do more in person
3253280	3260640	stuff. Just, you know, if you and I just to use this to stay with this example, if you and I were
3260640	3266960	planning to meet, it could not just be because it's such a big distance between us. It can just be
3266960	3271600	like, okay, we talked for an hour and then bye, see you later. It has to be like, okay, if you're
3271600	3276000	visiting, you know, I have to kind of help accommodate you and help find accommodation for
3276000	3283520	you or vice versa. It becomes more than what we were initially interested in. We have to embrace
3283520	3289200	more. We have to kind of accept that there's going to be more inconvenience for this, you know,
3289200	3296000	a small slice of interaction that I was planning. I'm supposed to, I'm forced to have like a whole
3296000	3302880	bunch of unplanned, you know, but necessary, it's going to be a lot of necessary evil in that process.
3303600	3312880	But technology is really, it's good at eliminating all those and giving us just that one slice,
3312880	3317360	precisely the slice that you asked for, you're going to get it and then turn it off, turn off the
3318240	3328080	zoom and you're done. But there's a, we can be skeptical of that purity.
3329040	3333120	Yeah, yeah. I mean, I've always been skeptical of this idea of like,
3333120	3339920	pristine purity, refined things. I, I, I, here's a game where I'm sorry, I keep referring to
3339920	3344000	Jack. He is one of my master signifiers. I refer to him a lot because I've essentially,
3344000	3350000	my ontology is just ontology. And like, he always talks about that yet. There's something it's in
3350000	3358240	the, it's in the, the flaws, it's in the, the lopsidedness, it's in the, the antagonisms,
3358240	3363360	whatever you may call it, it's, it's in the error itself in some sense, the answer lies.
3364160	3371120	And, and I liked the idea that complete order is felt, that's fascism, but also
3371680	3376240	complete disorder, that's anarchism, right? So I'm not trying to say you need to get
3376240	3380720	find the best of both, but I think that the trick is to find disorder in the order.
3382160	3387280	And to see that, okay, yeah, yeah, things can be seamless, but there's some, there's value to
3387280	3396240	things going wrong too. An example is that way, you know, when the Frenchy jokes around,
3396240	3402240	when the cheese went off, the French took that, that error, the fault, and now we have blue cheese
3402320	3408400	over the wine, it went off, no, we have champagne. So it's to find something positive in the
3408400	3415360	error, something productive in the error itself. Yeah, yeah, philosophy itself could be an error
3415360	3421680	in normal conversation, in normal discourse. You know, there was this guy, Socrates, for example,
3421680	3428000	he kind of introduced weird variations in questioning people and questions and answers.
3428880	3432880	But to make that official, to officially bring that into conversation,
3434320	3437280	that would be the active philosophy, the decision.
3440240	3445920	And speaking of, David, I would like to revisit the agony of eros, because this is certainly,
3445920	3450640	I think, but I think it's the same for you, burnout and agony of eros are my favorite.
3450640	3456000	I've only read probably four or five of his books. So I certainly love this book.
3456800	3461520	One point I want to make about the agony of eros is, and I don't know what your thoughts on this
3461520	3469040	are. So we talk a lot about this, like the other and how the other can be a complete alien other,
3469040	3478240	and then they kind of disturb our sameness, our controlled life. But I really liked the kind
3478240	3483680	of the notion that Alain Bajor makes that, yes, it's true that the other is completely alien,
3483680	3491440	you can never plan the love event in that sense. But when he says love takes two,
3492000	3497360	and in the event of love, by allowing yourself to like opening yourself up to the other,
3498000	3503520	there is a higher truth or a newer truth created. So love becomes a project in that sense. So it's
3503520	3509440	not that the other is a complete alien and then your life is complete chaos. But through this,
3509440	3514800	again, it's paradoxically through opening yourself up to this other, you've, in some
3514800	3521520	sense, you find a truth even about yourself. And I'm wondering, I don't know if that makes
3521520	3526000	sense. I'm sorry for being a bit long winded. No, no, no, no. Just like if you want to comment
3526000	3531360	on that, because for me, that's a beautiful idea of like letting ourself love and opening
3531360	3538720	us up to the other. Yeah, I think maybe something that you also are, you're also expressing in that
3539840	3550720	with that sentiment is the idea that the other is not just outside, that it's an inner other too,
3550720	3560240	that you discover about yourself. That this logic of sameness, this imposition that we do,
3560240	3567440	we also impose it on ourselves. Like the idea of waking up and planning every minute,
3567440	3573040	since the moment you wake up until the moment optimizing everything, optimization is really
3573040	3578800	based based on the assumption that I know myself. I know what I can do. And I know what I want to do.
3579600	3586160	But it's, it's a very dull life if I operate with the assumption that I know everything
3587040	3593840	that about myself, I know what I'm what I should do. So yeah, I agree that it's, you know, our
3593840	3601200	relationships that we find aspects of ourselves that we wouldn't, we wouldn't find.
3603760	3609520	Long time ago, I had a friend who is a very close friend, and in a moment in a sentimental moment,
3609520	3615440	she told me, if I don't talk with you for too long, I will forget who I am.
3616800	3623440	And it really made me think, I feel, I feel like that's a general statement that we could apply
3623440	3630560	to all good friendships. And if we don't get in touch with our good friends, we will really lose
3630560	3636320	touch with ourselves. Because they provide us with a place, a good friendship, a good conversation,
3637360	3646800	provides us with a place to be, to dwell, to express who we are, and then be responded to.
3647760	3654240	And in that dialogue, we, we find something. And that part of that something is, is ourselves.
3655200	3662480	But it's not the narcissistic self. It's the, is the other self, if you will.
3664880	3669360	And how have you found, because I was going to read out, it's a bit of a mouthful. So let me
3669360	3673520	in fact, because the book ends the agony of heroes. And I'm so glad you brought up your friend,
3673520	3679200	because the, the part I'm going to read is about friendship. So beyond Shalan ends the,
3679200	3686880	the book saying, the philosopher is a friend, a lover. Here, the lover is not an outward personality
3687600	3694720	and empirical circumstance, but a presence that is intrinsic to thought, the condition of possibility
3694720	3702800	of thought itself, a living category, a transcendental lived reality. And this is perhaps my favorite
3702800	3708960	part, because this idea of thinking, thinking in the strong sense begins with heroes.
3710480	3718320	To be able to think, one must first have been a friend, a lover. Without heroes, thinking loses
3718320	3729280	all vitality and turmoil and becomes repetitive and reactive. Heroes infuses thinking with desire
3729280	3736800	for the atopic other. So, you know, and this your friend said that she, she kind of
3736800	3741680	forgets even who she is, unless she's in dialogue with you. And I'd say I have a lot of friends in
3741680	3747760	my life where I do know if I don't talk to them, eventually I start forgetting even who I am.
3750320	3756160	I love that line. Thank you for reading that. To be able to think one must first have been a
3756160	3766320	friend, a lover. It's so true. And it, you know, because people who have an interest in philosophy
3766320	3773440	and have been involved with philosophy for years, they might forget that, that it didn't begin with
3773440	3782080	an interest in a given book or a philosophical question. It began as maybe in a context of a
3782080	3786560	relationship with a teacher or with a friend, with a person who seemed very intriguing.
3787840	3795760	There was friendliness there at the bottom. And that's why a lot of times, philosophical
3795760	3802400	questions begin with a line of thought with something like, what is love? What is true love?
3803520	3809600	Or, you know, in some movies, characters ask each other, can men and women really be just friends?
3809680	3814880	You have a relationship with someone and within the context of a relationship, friendship,
3815440	3822240	those questions are posed. But the engine of those questions is their relationship,
3822240	3828080	that's the idea. But it's so easy to forget that. And that itself is also interesting
3828080	3832720	that we forget. Yeah, yeah. No, I think that's beautiful.
3833680	3840880	Well, I feel like we did touch on the burnout society, but I perhaps maybe let's try that,
3840880	3846480	because for me, what I was thinking was, so for myself, I've been recommending
3846480	3849840	Byung-Shul Han to many people and even sharing your videos around, in fact.
3850720	3855680	And one reason I do that is because I think people that aren't, and I don't mean this in
3855680	3860800	any way in like a super serious, you know, condescending way, people that aren't, let's say,
3861680	3866960	obsessed with reading the way you and I are. You know, this is why I started the question
3866960	3872720	with how do you read philosophy? Because, you know, philosophers write in dense ways that are,
3872720	3878960	you know, esoteric and abstruse, it's really hard to get through to them. And for me, Byung-Shul
3878960	3885200	Han is certainly an exception, because I find his work extremely accessible, like he writes in very
3885280	3894080	clear, concise terms, plain language. And that's, that's one reason, you know, I talk about him.
3894080	3899520	So, but then the other reason is because he theorizes, he's a, he's a living, breathing,
3899520	3904160	critical theorist, right? It's not, we're not reading Heidegger from the 20th century or,
3904720	3909760	or Adorno from the 20th century, we're reading a person that's, that's in, for instance, in
3909760	3914240	Transparency Society. He talks about Facebook, you know, he talks about social media. So,
3915760	3921040	I'm curious to ask a rather, there's a bit of a banal question, but I think it's worth discussing
3921040	3926320	what are your views on the world of social media? This, I mean, I'm going to stop calling it the
3926320	3930560	online world, because I don't think it's the online world anymore. It is our world. It's our
3930560	3937440	life world. Social media has become, it's become the modern church that become the, the town square
3937520	3943440	in some sense. So, just through the kind of the Beyoncé hard framework, let's say, or worldview,
3943440	3951200	what are your views on the world of social media? Yeah, great. The world of social media, these,
3951200	3960880	these media platforms, there are places for consumption, but they're also, at the same time,
3960960	3969520	places for production. You and I, we both go there to produce, and they are not neutral. They,
3969520	3975680	they put demands on us. They put demands on us both when we are consuming and they put demands
3975680	3982640	on us both, you know, also when we are, you know, putting a producer hat or content creator
3983280	3990880	uncomfortable with that phrase. But, you know, we all, as somebody who posts, anybody who posts
3991680	3998560	regularly on, on YouTube, you know that the super ego of the YouTuber tells, tells him or her
3999440	4005840	or them that you should put, put something every week. You should post something. You should have
4005840	4011600	a posting schedule. Why? Because the platform demands you, demands that from you. Algorithmic
4011680	4022480	DIA. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So social media, to me, every time I, I feel like
4023600	4030480	I'm really using social media for myself or for genuine human relationships, it always feels like
4031440	4037280	I'm cheating it or I'm getting away using it in the way that I'm not supposed to use. I have a
4037280	4044560	couple of friends that I, I messaged back and forth on Twitter, and Twitter with them is
4044560	4049520	like a messaging system. It's private messaging. You know, we have these long threads of
4051360	4057440	talking about books that we're reading. And Twitter or X is not supposed to be used that way.
4058640	4065600	It has its own way of, that it wants you to use it. Ideally, you will use it in this way.
4067840	4074640	So yeah, I think it's important to be, you're right. Han is important to read because he's writing
4075440	4082160	for our time. He's writing for us. He really is writing about things that are aspects of our
4082160	4090960	reality. And that includes the digital media, social media, or, you know, quote on quote social
4090960	4098240	media because they're not really social. I don't always feel like I'm connected when I, when I'm
4098240	4103840	there. So I decided I myself, I don't know what your thoughts are on this, but I decided to limit,
4103840	4109360	really limit. So I don't have Facebook anymore. I don't have Instagram anymore. I just felt like
4110000	4116800	I need one or two. So I kept YouTube and, and X formerly known as Twitter. These two, I feel
4116800	4125600	like, okay, two, I can, I can deal with them. I can be careful with them. But when it comes to like
4125600	4131920	multiple, you're always catching up. I felt like I was always catching up to them. And you have
4131920	4138480	different people in your social circle. Everybody is more on one platform. It's really, it's really
4138480	4143760	strange. And you forget that, you know, these people are not really in your life, some of them.
4143760	4148080	Some of them are not really in your life. You like delete Facebook, completely lose touch with
4148080	4153840	some of them. And I did. It was like, okay, what does that mean? I don't know.
4155520	4160080	Yeah, I like that you said social media is not social. I couldn't agree more. In fact,
4161440	4167600	it's a, for me, it should probably be called something like a narcissistic media or something
4167600	4171760	because it's, I've realized that this goes back to the idea of you, you discussing sameness
4173200	4178160	in social media. It's the ultimate tool to make everything same. Because everyone's just
4179120	4186080	another follower, another comment, another listener. And then, which is why, in fact, I should have
4186080	4190560	spoken about this earlier. I love that you do the reading groups, where it's a much more smaller,
4190560	4196560	closer community. And you know, the people that it's not a parasocial relationship.
4197360	4202320	That being said, David, I want to ask you this. I love asking this question from kind of people
4202320	4209520	who are into critical theory. So you probably noticed or observed a lot of technologists,
4209520	4215120	they, they think, okay, the solution is decentralization, crypto social media,
4215120	4221360	sorry, blockchain social media, or the solution is this new telegram or like, so
4222160	4229040	that they always look for technological solutions, right, as in to the, to our perils of our contemporary
4229040	4235600	world. Now, personally, I don't think the solution is technological, even though it's
4235600	4240560	interesting, you said that you cut off certain platforms, you cut off Instagram and Facebook,
4240560	4247600	and you only use Twitter and or X and YouTube, perhaps in that case, yeah, so those, those
4247600	4253840	platforms suit more of what you want to do on social media. But at a broader level, I'm wondering,
4253840	4260960	do you think not that there are simple solutions to any of this, but at least to, let's say,
4260960	4265440	reduce human suffering? I mean, I think that's a good thing that people, people have through
4265440	4269760	social media. Do you think that the solution is technological? Do you think it's,
4270720	4275920	it's something a lot more social and ideological or political even? Or has there got to be
4275920	4281360	something which is kind of a dialectical between between the both, between both these, let's say,
4281360	4292080	camps? I'm not sure. I think if you think of technology broadly,
4292160	4300800	beyond just digital technology, I think the answer has to be technological. And that just means
4301760	4309200	being mindful of how we use our infrastructure, the platforms that we have. And, you know,
4309200	4313760	I'm using technology in the sense that, you know, a chalkboard is a piece of technology, too.
4314720	4320880	You know, a matchbox is a, or a glass is, you know, a piece of technology. It, we,
4322880	4330000	any kind of solution requires its own technology and it's, it comes with its own set of beliefs
4330000	4336960	as well. So it's, I think they go hand in hand. The kind of world that is reflected in the
4337040	4344720	technologies that we embrace. But yeah, I'm not sure. I don't really spend much time thinking about
4346400	4355200	large-scale solutions. I don't think my brain really has those, those ambitions, unfortunately.
4357360	4362720	The reason I asked was because I think my, in fact, I still haven't got like a thesis topic,
4362720	4369040	but something I would like to theorize on is for my masters is like on the philosophy of technology
4369040	4377440	and kind of see if I can do that. And, you know, a person who perhaps the single handle of the
4377440	4383520	essay that influenced me the most is Heidegger's A Question Concerning Technology. And like the
4383520	4388880	idea is that, you know, this is now kind of like a point that I think everyone agrees on that
4388880	4395920	technology isn't itself a neutral thing. It has its own metaphysic. It's always
4397840	4402960	tilted towards a certain side. It cannot be neutral or objective. So when we introduce a
4402960	4408720	technology that itself comes with its baggage of let's say ideas and presupposition. So,
4410240	4417840	and like, but then the question is, does that mean, does that mean the, the, that technology,
4417840	4421200	you know, the kind of the more than the Marxist sense that our material conditions,
4421200	4428400	the technology will change how people, people's beliefs, or is it more that the technology is
4428400	4433440	created out of more of like the background beliefs people already have. So to use again,
4433440	4439280	Bjarne Schultz's idea that the idea of burnout society, where everything becomes a project,
4439280	4444000	you'd see people create like myriad software tools to make him a productive
4444960	4451600	and tracking tools, you know, different kinds of, so for me, those, those technologies are kind
4451600	4457840	of like symptoms of what our society has at the moment, like our current, yeah, in some sense,
4457840	4463520	I'd call it a sickness, you know. And so I don't know, I'm just bringing some ideas out here just
4463520	4468720	to, you know, hear your thoughts, but I found them quite interesting. Example I sometimes think
4468720	4478320	about is, you know, when I, for the first time I joined Twitter, I really became aware of how
4479200	4486000	my mind slowly started to think in terms of tweets. You know, this was years ago, this was,
4486000	4495840	I think, 2014. That was before I first deleted my Twitter account and joined again after some years.
4495840	4502160	But this, this change happens, this change of, you know, you're plugged into a, to a piece of
4502160	4513200	technology and it morphs, it shapes the ways in which not necessarily the content, but it forms
4513200	4518960	your thoughts, say, okay, your thoughts appear to you, appear in your mind in the form of a, of a
4518960	4524400	tweet, or you get an idea and the idea is already pre-packaged. If you're a YouTuber,
4525200	4531520	your idea is already, it comes to you in the form of a, of a YouTube idea, idea for a YouTube video
4531520	4537440	and you write it down. I'm sure that's how novelists or short story writers experience their
4537440	4542960	lives. They experience a moment where an idea comes to them and they write it down potentially,
4542960	4549120	because they are, they're, they're plugged into that practice of writing short stories or writing
4549120	4555120	novels. We are plugged into these technologies that we have relationships with and they enable
4555120	4562240	certain forms of, forms of expressions and prohibits other forms of expressions that, you know,
4562240	4571760	they're, they're out now. And if you take it, if you take a radical view, the kinds of expressions
4571760	4575920	that we come capable, we, we are capable of because of these technologies are the kind of,
4575920	4581760	kinds of expressions that we are capable of thinking. The things that we cannot say anymore
4581760	4589200	are the things that we cannot think anymore. So the, the very structure, the very form of our,
4589200	4595920	our beliefs are limited and formed. In addition to that, there's this time bound
4596880	4600880	and nature of the things that we say, you know, something comes to my mind. I
4600880	4606720	write a tweet about it and I let go of it. It's gone. I, my relationship to it becomes like,
4606720	4613120	oh, look at me. I did that. How many likes did I receive? Okay, 20 or 10 or two, you know,
4614000	4621120	but it becomes like, it brings it into a particular logic of sameness that all thoughts are equal.
4621840	4626640	You know, the difference between them is based on this metric of likes or views or whatever
4626640	4635840	the metric is that the platform tells us. You talked about that. You said these technologies
4635840	4642720	might shape our beliefs. But I think before that, that's, that's certainly true that they influence
4642720	4649280	what we believe, but they also influence how we believe. They influence how we relate to the things,
4649280	4654880	how strictly, how seriously we take them, or what else do we take seriously? Like,
4656480	4658400	is that what you meant by the form of belief?
4660320	4666800	Yeah. Yeah, the form. I see. The how, the how of our, you know, thoughts. Indeed. Indeed. In fact,
4666800	4670400	uh, you know, Simon Critchley, when I spoke to him, he made a really good point that, yes,
4671120	4677280	the internet social media has done, it's done wonders for philosophy because now everyone's,
4677360	4681200	you know, having these kinds of conversations, people are listening to philosophers online. It's
4681200	4686960	like everyone's exposed to philosophy in some sense. It's just, it's so convenient. But
4687600	4693280	it's been terrible for the novel. It's been terrible for long form. You, you kind of,
4693280	4699280	you sit in some corner, no distractions, and you just read a book. You read, I don't know,
4699280	4704640	James Joyce. So I'm not that I've read James Joyce, but you know, where you can, you can really
4705440	4709360	spend days and even months, you know, carefully gone through a book. And
4710160	4714800	because of this idea that as you, you said it, well, that all, everything's the same. All ideas
4714800	4723840	are the same. So no, no, no pinker, no novel, no work of art deserves some kind of salience over
4723840	4730080	every other book out there, you know, and, and, and I find that quite interesting. So, and,
4731040	4735760	and yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, because for me, I always thought that
4737120	4741200	it's, it's, it's a rather like simple thing to say that, oh, of course, technology affects us
4741200	4745920	and our thoughts. That's, that's fine. But my, something I really would like to explore more is
4746560	4752320	what, what creates technology? I mean, okay, a part of it is certainly this kind of creative
4752320	4758880	impulse that we all humans have this, this need to create. But the, the, the different kinds of
4758880	4765520	technologies we do create in our society. What's the, what are the, what's, what are the ideological
4765520	4771520	presuppositions we create them off? You know, be the productivity app and my background's in computer
4771520	4775840	science. I'm a software engineer. So I think a lot about software, you know, be the productivity
4775840	4780880	app or some kind of like sales app. So what are the presuppositions we have when we have the
4780880	4784000	motivations to create a technology? And that's the part that interests me.
4784000	4792320	And is that motivation, is, is that motivation something that we get from the market?
4793200	4798000	Yeah. I mean, that's, that's a good question. Cause like, okay, a very, I think I'm playing
4798000	4801760	with it, put it as, yes, for money. I want to, you know, I want to make, I want to have like a
4801760	4806720	startup and make a lot of money. But I don't know. I don't think it's that simple. I think
4806720	4811040	that's a bit of a, because there are many ways to make money. I mean, you could, I don't know, you
4811040	4817280	could become a real estate agent and make a lot of money. But I find that these, especially in
4817280	4821680	the tech world, the more of like the hipster creative types, they have this, you know, they
4821680	4825840	have this very like, even like a messiah complex, I want to save the world. I want to create this
4825840	4832000	amazing software that, that revolutionizes lives. And so my question is where do those beliefs come
4832000	4838320	from? Right. But the very, the very statement that this is going to make money, that itself,
4838320	4847360	tacitly, it is expressing a set of beliefs about the market that a certain type of app will sell
4847360	4851440	because, that's true, because there's a demand for it, because there's a market for it, because
4851440	4856000	certain types of things are in demand, because we live in a culture where productivity is,
4856560	4861280	is in value and people are struggling with it. So a productivity app is going to be great.
4862320	4864240	And so those, those kinds of,
4864720	4868800	now I stood one, I said, like, if you want to make money, you want to create something that,
4868800	4874880	that falls within the logic of the market. And then that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4875920	4881440	Excellent. And said, I mean, oh, wow, it's funny, I lost record time. It's almost,
4881440	4886880	we, we got about 10, 15 minutes remaining. I was going to say, I wasn't very efficient.
4887520	4891680	Oh, no, please. Oh my God, don't worry. This has been an absolutely enjoyable path. And
4892000	4898000	this has been an absolute pleasure for the police. I mean, look, I really hope we can have a lot more
4898000	4902800	conversations and like keep on, keep this dialogue going. But it's funny, I was going to say,
4903680	4908720	in the interest of time, and then I realized that the utter hypocrisy of that, that we're talking
4908720	4916160	about slowness and taking time, but, but just for the listeners, because really, you know,
4916880	4922880	my, one of my goals with this conversation, again, see, I'm goal oriented was to kind of
4922880	4927760	propagandize for Bianchel Han. It really was that I really wanted more people to read him because
4927760	4934160	I think, I think that's great value in, in, in reading his work. Just, just, yeah, just for
4934160	4940880	the listeners to kind of put in like a very simplistic way, let's say, or like in a nutshell,
4940960	4948880	to use the term I hate. What do you think of Bianchel Han's perhaps his most valuable insights
4948880	4954720	and his most pertinent insights to our time and that perhaps can be a reason to read him?
4956640	4964640	I would say I would emphasize for people who are new to Han, I would, you know, my kind of
4964880	4974880	invitation would be, he is really great at connecting our very personal experiences,
4974880	4983920	like the experience of being tired, the experience of not having enough mental energy to do all the
4983920	4990560	tasks that you're supposed to do, the experiences of loneliness, being tired and alone, you know,
4991520	5001120	at the end of the day. And all these experiences, he pays attention to them and he connects them to
5001120	5010800	broader patterns, broader trends in culture, in society, in technology. And that is really valuable,
5010800	5017840	I think. He keeps, he doesn't keep the discussion of private experiences at that level, at that
5018480	5023120	scope, at that original scope of interest. Yes, of course, we're interested in it, but
5023760	5029120	he helps us make sense of it by putting it in a larger context and different contexts. And
5029120	5037520	with the help of different thinkers, he introduces us to a host of other valuable thinkers like Foucault,
5037520	5047360	Plato, Nietzsche, Arendt, Hannah Arendt, and he's very good at connecting the
5048080	5052880	moments in our thought, in a discussion, with the right moments, the right person,
5053760	5062880	and bringing a passage, a quotation. He really has an, he's very artful in the use of quotations,
5062880	5070960	in the use of references. So that style, that general style, I think, is a great contribution.
5072960	5081680	He also highlights these structures that we are participating in. And becoming aware of these
5081680	5086720	structures, I think, is very helpful. We won't forget those structures that he's talking about.
5087040	5097120	And then, like any good thinker, he also has his maybe points where we can critically engage with
5097120	5105360	him and respond to him. But that's, you know, that's part of the journey. Indeed. I don't
5105360	5110240	know if I, if I responded to your question. No, you absolutely did. In fact, just on that note,
5110800	5116720	you even, in one, in a couple of your book reviews, you do, you are critical. You do say,
5116720	5123600	yeah, that this is probably not, not my favorite book of hands. Yeah, I think that's, that's,
5123600	5130480	you hit the nail on the head, David, because for me, I think people who read a lot of self-help books,
5132080	5135920	they would really benefit from reading Marshall Hahn, because what he makes, he makes the
5135920	5142160	private social, he shows how the private is political, that what we think are these private
5142160	5148480	struggles, they, they, they are social struggles, that they're, they're a result of the society
5148480	5156000	we live in. So I think that's a beautiful place to conclude. And at the moments where he says,
5156000	5160640	okay, if you just, you might think that if you just push hard enough, you will get to the,
5160720	5165040	to the bright side, you will get to the, you will solve it, you know, if you just
5165600	5170960	optimize yourself enough, but that's part of it. But that's not, that's not
5172720	5175040	the solution. That's, that's part of the structure of the problem.
5175040	5177840	The solution itself is part of the problem. Yeah.
5177840	5181440	That's right. That's right. The promise of the solution is a false promise.
5183200	5187840	Thank you, David. I hope this is the first of many more conversations to come between
5187840	5190640	me. I hope so too. Thank you. I hope so too. Thank you so much.
