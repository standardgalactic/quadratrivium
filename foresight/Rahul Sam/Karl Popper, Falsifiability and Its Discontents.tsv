0	5760	So, Professor Streamins, if you could start with Poppa and then, of course, the
5760	10800	unfortifiability principle. Now, anyone could, I don't think it's that hard, even for a layperson
10800	15680	like myself, to just Google what it means and get a very elementary understanding.
15680	22400	So perhaps you could firstly just explain what the Kyle Poppa, Popperian unfortifiability
22400	28800	principle is. But then also, as you've done in the book, rather well, maybe lay down some of your
28800	35920	criticisms, criticisms of it just for the audience. Yeah, sure. So Poppa thought that really the heart
35920	42160	of the scientific method was this very simple idea that if a theory makes a false prediction,
42160	49440	it has to be wrong somehow. And Poppa thought that at the core of the scientific inquiry was
49440	55040	the systematic elimination of all of the false theories. And notionally, of course, you could
55040	59280	imagine one day having eliminated them all and just having one true theory remaining, although
59280	66960	if Poppa was understood as well as anyone, that was not a realistic prospect. But he thought
66960	70720	we could at least think of ourselves as making progress by eliminating the false theories.
71360	75520	So the thing that makes that, oh, go ahead. No, I'm just going to ask, please continue.
75520	79600	I'm not going to follow up on that, but keep going. Yeah. Okay. So the thing that makes that,
79600	85520	though, now turning to where he begins to run into difficulties, and yeah, he had plenty of
85520	89520	things to say about these difficulties. It's not as if this is some sort of one-shot
90560	97360	undermining in his view. But it's really difficult when a theory does make a false
97360	102720	prediction to figure out whether it was really the theory's fault or not. Science is such a
102800	110480	complicated thing. And in particular, the kinds of measurement apparatus that are used to make
110480	116480	observations in cutting-edge science are often very complicated, fragile things that only work
116480	124320	when conditions are exactly right. 99.9% of the time, when you get a false prediction, it's not
124320	128320	really the theory's fault at all. It's just that something went wrong with the apparatus. Or maybe
128320	134160	you made a false assumption when you were making your calculations. Or maybe even, and this does
134160	138720	happen, there's an error in the software that you're using to analyze your results. And so it's not
138720	142560	really the theory's fault or not, and it would be a terrible mistake to throw away the theory,
142560	149440	just because you got this false prediction. So if you're going to capture the spirit of
149440	156560	Papa's proposal, you have to figure out some way of deciding when it's okay to just say,
156640	160960	oh, something went wrong with the apparatus. And when you should say, ah, no, this time,
160960	165680	it's the theory's fault. And so we've falsified the theory, as he says, we can throw away the theory.
166320	169600	Sometimes, of course, you can just see that something went wrong with the apparatus.
170160	178800	Like, you know, it's smoking, making, but often, in many cases in the history of science,
178800	183040	we have results that were anomalous and looked like they cross problems with theories and we
183120	186560	will never know what went wrong, because it's just too late to go back and check.
189040	192160	I'm sure we'll probably end up talking about some examples later on, but
194960	202320	but this Papa really never fully satisfactorily answered this question of when it's okay to blame
203520	207280	the apparatus or other assumptions, and when you should blame the theory.
208160	212960	I think he had, you know, he had interesting substantive things to say, but he didn't succeed
212960	220400	in writing down what he was really after, which was a kind of a systematic calculus, if you like,
220400	226160	for making these decisions, something that took these decisions out of the hands of scientists
226160	230960	who might be indulging in motivated reasoning, you know, trying to see their own theory in a good
230960	235280	light and just sort of said, no, you must follow this logic and this logic says your theory is wrong.
235840	241680	Yeah, because I haven't read his book where he introduced the principle of what's it called
241680	248320	the logic of science, I believe, but that's it. Yeah, I haven't read that book, although my
248320	254160	understanding, again, at a very elementary level is that it seems that Papa really wanted some kind
254160	261840	of a priori principle or even theory of science that allows scientists to do science. And then
261840	267920	what you would argue for and many others would be that Oh, well, unfortunately, for better or worse,
267920	273920	let's say, we haven't found that. Yeah. And so what you in fact have is, you know, I kind of made
273920	277680	it all sound like more like a philosophical argument, but the fact of science is you have real
277680	284160	arguments over these things should whether when to whether whether probably the result is just an
284160	289440	artifact of some problem with the measuring apparatus or the theory really is in trouble. In fact,
289440	296960	that's almost more normal than any other state of affairs. So some typically scientists who performed
296960	302560	in perform the experiment will trust the apparatus more than the scientists sort of a few labs over
302560	307200	who who weren't there to kind of see it all operating and so on. And you know, in the end,
307200	312080	when if scientists keep going for long enough, there does seem to be a kind of a consensus
312080	316560	that consensus that forms the experiments get done enough times been after different people.
317440	324000	It's not as if it's we're just totally at sea, but it doesn't have this simple crisp objective
325360	329360	algorithmic feel to it that Papa was really reaching for.
330960	336080	Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess that leads us to, I don't know if I should call it the antithesis,
336080	342320	but at least let's say we'll juxtapose Thomas Kuhn's theory that the paradigm shift, the term that he
342320	349280	popularized with the Popperian principle. Yeah, so the structures of scientific revolutions,
349280	354080	perhaps my favorite book on philosophy of science, yours is a healthy contender.
357440	363840	So in contrast to Karl Popper, Professor Srivence, what's, how does Thomas Kuhn differ? Because
363840	370640	he came after Popper, isn't that right? So Papa was, Papa wrote his book
371600	377360	in the 1930s and Kuhn wrote his book in the 1960s to give you some sense. So Popper is in a way,
377360	384320	essentially, into war, I suppose we would now say, and Kuhn is very much post-war. And Papa was
384320	389200	still kind of firing on all cylinders by then, but he wasn't presenting whole new ideas.
391360	398480	Well, he was entitled to kind of have a break. So Kuhn's idea is actually, it doesn't dispense
398480	403200	with the idea of a scientific method, as I was saying earlier, but rather the idea is that at any
403200	412160	particular time period, a science, say, like particle physics, or molecular genetics, or
413120	418720	economics, maybe microeconomics, will have a particular method, a particular set of rules
418720	422560	for doing science, and actually a rather comprehensive set of rules for doing science.
423520	431520	But that these methods are not fixed for all time. In fact, they change from time to time
431520	439280	in dramatic episodes called scientific revolutions, or the phrase that Kuhn famously popularized for
439280	445120	this is a paradigm shift. And the thing, the paradigm here is this kind of big method for
445120	451680	doing science. And when it shifts, that means the old paradigm has crumbled, and a new one
451680	458480	comes along and replaces it. So whereas Papa and sort of classic, the classic searches for a
458480	463200	scientific method, we're looking for a single rule that is valid for all time, as you said,
463200	472000	hopefully our priority, one that we can just know is right without, with certainty. Kuhn thought
473120	478400	these these methods only last for a while, and then their scientists actually pushed them to
478400	482560	the point where they're all of their flaws are exposed, because they're actually, they're very
482560	486640	rich, but they're also kind of limited, they have a lot of assumptions built in, and inevitably
486640	491040	some of those assumptions will turn out to be wrong. And so scientists pushed them to their
491040	498800	breaking point. And in effect, they, they destroy their own methods by by exposing the
498800	504080	faulty assumptions or whatever. And then some new method has to come along and supplant the old
504080	508480	method, a new paradigm comes along and supplants the old paradigm, that's a paradigm shift,
508480	514400	that's a scientific revolution, then you have a whole new methodological complex governing
514400	518400	what scientists do in in whatever area of science it is.
