0	2640	The part I sort of love most about your work
2640	7640	is your teachings on the Lacanian perspective on language.
8000	11280	So I kind of want to ask from you
11280	15040	what the kind of meta psychology of Lacan
15040	19320	tells us about human subjectivity apropos language.
19320	23040	And if I may, I want to read out a short excerpt
23040	24880	from your book, is that okay?
24880	27400	Just on the topic of language.
27400	32400	So on page 215, you say the autistic subjects in this case,
34840	36800	there's no other as language for them.
36800	38400	But then in the introduction,
38400	40880	there's this really good excerpt that you give,
40880	42560	which I love to be honest.
42560	44280	It says, yeah, according to Lacan,
44280	48480	language precedes the existence of an individual
48480	52840	in the sense that if it exists before he or she is born
52840	56720	and subsists after his or her death,
56720	60200	as Fink emphasizes in his book, The Lacanian Subject,
60200	61760	before a child is born,
61760	66040	he or she is already endowed with a name as well
66040	68440	as assigned with the personality,
68440	73440	all of which are imagined by his or her parents
73640	77240	through their use of signifiers.
77240	81000	These signifiers used to endow the child
81000	85400	with an existence in language are not uniquely invented
85440	89280	by the parents, but are acquired from a symbolic order
89280	91880	that has been accumulating for centuries
91880	94800	preceding his or her conception.
94800	98920	This system of signifiers is governed by a set of laws
98920	103600	and is determined by Lacan as the other of language.
103600	107240	And I was thinking if anyone needs
107240	109600	kind of some kind of motivation to read more Lacan,
109600	111760	this excerpt itself should be good enough,
111760	114520	especially if you're interested in philosophy.
114560	118200	So Leon, what is Lacan have to say about language
118200	121560	and why in particular is language so important
121560	126000	or I would say crucial for Lacanian psychoanalysis?
126000	129760	Yes, you know, it is language that is important.
132320	134400	And I'll just say it here,
134400	139400	but it is the way that language impacts the body
141560	143200	which is at stake.
143200	145080	So we have to remember that.
145080	147880	But let's get to it maybe when we continue
147880	152240	and I'll just try and say this a common sensically.
153240	154880	There's a certain idea
156800	159400	that we might simplify by saying that
161920	166920	when we look at, let's say, or organisms like humans,
167920	171480	we clearly notice that our existence
171480	174520	has a certain continuity to it.
174520	177240	Many philosophers tried to think about this
177240	181400	and I think John Locke had a certain idea
181400	184000	of sort of a string of consciousness
184000	186640	as long as the same consciousness remains there.
186640	189760	So that I can say, I was here three months ago,
189760	192560	it's still me, then we say,
193560	198560	oh, there's a certain identity to this prolonged experience.
199480	201640	But even prior to this question,
203200	206240	in order to conceive of a certain continuation,
207720	210560	a certain, let's say, relationship between
210560	212720	what one experienced that point A
212720	215840	and what one experiences today,
215840	218600	we have to assume that something is,
218600	220640	let's say, inscribed somewhere.
221560	223560	I'll give you an example, a very simple one,
223560	228560	let's say a camera has a lens and has some film.
230320	232560	Now, if we take out the film,
232560	235560	the camera, the lens will still see the world.
235560	238040	The futons will still go through it.
238040	241920	So things will be, let's say, perceived in the world.
241920	244240	But in order for there to be a memory
244240	249240	or to have a certain testimony to that thing that happened,
249280	252800	we need a film, we need something to be written.
252800	256240	So language for me, and I think for Lacan,
256240	258600	it's this very essential thing.
258600	263360	It is whatever is used to write, to inscribe.
263360	265360	So in this sense, it is not the English language
265360	270360	or the Farsi language or the Japanese language.
271400	275680	It is whatever means one uses
275680	278720	in order to inscribe something that remains.
279560	282880	So it could be just something like this.
282880	285200	We speak about it in many ways.
285200	289520	Psychiatrists speak about it as sort of neuronal connections.
289520	292280	It is a writing in the flesh.
292280	294080	So this is language.
294080	297320	Now, why language is so important for humans?
297320	299920	And this is something that Lacan already says
299920	301480	in his paper on the mirror stage.
301480	303600	It's a very early paper.
303600	308600	And he says, look, human beings are born underdeveloped.
308880	311000	They're born half-paked.
311000	314280	And you see it in comparison to other animals,
314280	315520	some of which are born
315520	320080	and just start roaming the world if we speak about,
320080	323880	I don't know, insects or lizards or stuff like that.
323880	326640	But also mammals, if you look at mammals,
326640	328440	they are born, they can start walking,
328440	331560	they can start sniffing, many of them.
331600	334240	So when we think about the organism
334240	338200	and sort of the hard-wired level of the instinct,
339120	343400	for many animals, these instincts are sufficient
343400	347000	for them to exist in a world, in their world,
347000	348360	from the moment of birth.
349360	351360	But for humans, this is not the case.
351360	354240	Our instincts, all the things that we are born with
354240	357040	instinctually are completely insufficient
357040	359200	for our survival in the beginning.
359240	362360	A baby cannot do anything, basically.
362360	364440	And without the caretaker,
364440	368840	there will not be any chance for survival.
369920	374920	So we say that the baby is in the womb, let's say.
376320	379920	The baby has a need and these needs are answered.
379920	383840	But as soon as the baby is born, it might be hungry,
383840	388360	it might be, I don't know, it might need a diaper change,
388360	391880	but this does not happen automatically, immediately.
391880	394240	So we say that after birth,
394240	397440	there is necessarily a certain lack
397440	400880	that is presented in the child's libidinal economy.
400880	403000	Something is needed, but it's not satisfied.
403000	406680	Let's say, mom is at the toilet, dad is not here,
406680	408200	the child is hungry.
409560	412480	Now the child is not fed immediately.
412480	415960	What the child has to do is to take on itself
415960	420440	a certain representation that is linguistic
420440	423560	and address it to another person.
423560	426520	So this is the cry, the baby cries
426520	431520	and then the parent starts to guess what is at stake
432160	434600	and then maybe the baby is fed.
434600	436200	But what you see here is the fact
436200	440800	that language is necessary in order to,
440800	444960	let's say, compensate for this inherent
445160	448800	born gap between the level of the instinct
448800	452720	and the world for the human baby.
452720	457720	Humans are born into a reality where our instincts
458360	461880	and our, let's say, reality, our human reality,
461880	466880	the humanized world are in a complete separation.
468840	469760	There's a schism.
470840	472600	And the only way to connect them
472600	476920	to gain access to this world is by addressing an other,
476920	480200	using a language that is not mine.
481960	485760	This language is used to inscribe something
485760	488960	in this gap between the instinctual level
488960	490760	and the humanized world.
490760	493480	And let's say this inscription
493480	496560	and the way that languages use to inscribe
497800	501280	is what we might identify in the clinic
501280	502600	as a clinical structure.
503640	508640	So everyone relies on language to attempt to compensate
508680	512760	for an inherent gap, an inherent schism,
512760	517000	inherent split in every human's existence.
517000	518760	And we use language in different ways
518760	520560	in order to compensate for it.
520560	523120	No one is able to bridge this gap.
523120	527440	There is no one that lives in nirvana, sadly,
528520	530720	in a place where it is true.
530720	535600	The inner world and the environment are in complete
535600	536480	unicity.
536480	539240	There is no such thing only in our fantasies.
539240	541600	So everyone uses language in a different way to do it.
541600	544080	And what Freud was identifying,
544080	546640	I think in his beginning on his work,
546640	549200	is these particular ways
549200	551960	that people use language in order to compensate.
551960	553080	And he was saying, look at this,
553080	555920	this is the neurotic way to compensate
555920	560040	for this inherent schism in human existence.
560040	562240	This is the psychotic way
562240	564360	to compensate for this inherent schism.
564360	568680	And what I argue in my book is that there is an autistic way
568680	571600	to compensate for this inherent schism.
572400	575120	I go to great lengths to describe it
575120	577160	because I think it is very different
577160	580440	from the neurotic and psychotic way.
580440	584400	And I say that it is different to such an extent
584400	588400	that it necessitates a different clinical approach.
588440	590920	And this is why I say that autism is distinct,
590920	592440	is a distinct structure.
592440	594400	Because I'm basically saying,
594400	598280	when we work with particular subjects
598280	601840	that compensate for this schism using language
601840	603480	in a particular way,
603480	606480	we have to situate ourselves in the transference
606480	607480	in a different way.
