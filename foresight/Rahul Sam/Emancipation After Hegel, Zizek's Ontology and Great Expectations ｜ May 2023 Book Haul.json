{"text": " Hey everyone, welcome to my May 2023 book haul video. This one in particular, I'm gonna be quite happy. My frugal ass is gonna be quite happy. Specifically because of this pile here. I've got more books, but this pile here is is making my frugal ass very happy given that all of this costed just I think less than $20. So I got some some great books here, and I only paid 20 bucks for all of this thanks to secondhand shopping that I went with with with a few friends. In fact, I looked up this sociology book. It's just like a kind of like not a textbook really, but more as the title suggests the key concepts by Rotolidge. It was on Amazon for 35 bucks. I got this for less than five dollars, I think so that is fantastic. I highly highly recommend secondhand book shopping. It's not really something I've done a lot given that some of the books that I do buy to be rather what's it would not not as popular as some like let's say a Jane Austen or a Charles Dickens. So it's kind of hard to find exactly what I want outside of buying it from from Amazon or some large bookseller. But man, what I really do enjoy about secondhand book shopping is that kind of like spontaneity where you just pick up great books by authors that you've been reading for a while and then you get it for like two bucks. It's fantastic. Okay, let's start off. The first book is I've already started this book as you can see from the bookmark. You actually can't see that. There you go. It's Alan Kazupanchek's What Is Sex? Man, I've only read like what 10 pages so far because I'm trying really quite slowly and really really led the idea to settle in me because you know sexuality, sex, these words are very loaded terms, but they're kind of the philosophical and even ontological approach Alan Kazupanchek is taking in this book. It's it's at least for me being a neo-fight. It seems rather unorthodox and I'm trying to like let the ideas really settle and kind of battle with them in some sense and in fact, I'll be doing a book review on this for sure because I think it's a topic worth discussing particularly given the current political climate. The next book is now, you know, okay, I'll take both books out. In fact, Todd McGovern, his Emancipation After Hegel and his other book Capitalism and Desire. This book, I've read parts of it, but I want to get through the whole thing. This one, I haven't and man, I am excited for this because so for instance, here's a review that Slavoj Zizek wrote on this book Emancipation After Hegel. Here's what he said. This is the book we were waiting for after long years of being bombarded by Hegel as a clotted liberal whose last word is recognition. With Todd McGovern, the revolutionary Hegel is back. However, it is not the old Marxist Hegel, but the Hegel After Marx. The Hegel who makes us aware that revolution is an open and risk process which necessarily entails catastrophic failures. Hegel's problem, how to save the legacy of the French Revolution after its breakdown is our problem today. How to save the project of radical emancipation after the catastrophe of starvinism in a truly democratic country. Emancipation After Hegel would be reprinted in hundreds of thousands of copies and distributed for free to all students. Read this book or ignore it at your own risk. I really like the last sentence because generally Zizek isn't a very kind of prescriptive thinker. He never tells you what to do. He's more like a he's a critique and an analyst and the fact that he said read this book or ignore it at your own risk, it gives very Jordan Peterson vibes, in fact. But now I certainly am going to get to this soon. In fact, I think after too much to read, but I think after what is sex, I'm going to read the emancipation after Hegel, not really even for the political aspects of it, but man, I've been so just obsessed with this idea of contradiction the past couple of months. It's been taking up all of my thinking to probably an unhealthy level because I'm trying to analyze everything via that lens of Hegelian contradiction. Okay, so yeah, that's that book and then of course capitalism and desire. One of my, I'd say one of my personal goals in life, kind of like a dream is to get Tom McGovern on my podcast and discuss this book and particularly let him elucidate as to why Marxists really need to take psychoanalysis seriously. So I'm gonna, yeah, try and work towards that and aspire towards that, but I think I haven't even reached out to him yet, but before I do reach out, I think I need to attune myself more with this work and give it a bit more time before having a conversation with him. And the next book is Adrian Johnston's D\u017eek's Ontology. This is also something, obviously, given that I'm a huge D\u017eek here. I would certainly want to read soon, although I think this book is gonna wait till the end of the year because I want to get through some of Tom McGovern's and Zupan\u010dek's work. And you know, given that D\u017eek is this huge figure, Goliath of a figure in the Slovenian school of, Slovenian philosophers, you know, D\u017eek, Zupan\u010dek, and in fact, I shouldn't even say that I should say more of the kind of the, these new Hegelians, the way people like McGovern or Adrian Johnston or of course D\u017eek. D\u017eek is such a daunting, towering figure that we tend to focus only on his work. So I want to try and focus a bit more on the other thinkers. Zupan\u010dek, McGovern, Johnston, before, not long before, why I'm also paying attention to D\u017eek's work. It's also the fact that D\u017eek is a prolific writer, so he just writes so much. Okay, I think I went through all of that. Yes. So now let's get to my other book pile. All of these were not really planned purchases. It's the best part of you know, going secondhand book shopping, you just pick up whatever's there. Yep, The Prophet by Khaled Gibran, my friend who I went with, she told me, she in fact read this book and she told me she hated it. But I do know some people really, really enjoy this book and it's kind of a very popular book. So I probably won't read it this year. Let's be honest, I'm reading some other stuff, but it's just always good to have in the collection. Ah, Jen Austen's Persuasions. I watched the film on Netflix. Wasn't impressed, wasn't impressed, because to be honest, I did quite like Pride and Prejudice. I thought it was quite good. But Persuasions, it wasn't all that good. The next book is Charles Dickens Great Expectations. This is, yeah, I want to get to this. Dickens, man, I think it's kind of hard because I really do want to spend at least six months getting through most of Charles Dickens's work, particularly because I think, even though I've only read Hard Times and what's the other one? I've read one other Dickens book. Doesn't matter. Hard Times for sure, but there's one on the book I've read. I feel like a lot of his thinking, I mean, obviously he's a literary figure, but at a philosophical level, at a sociological level, what he tries to delineate in his books is kind of what I try to theorize on in society and make sense of. So I gotta take him more seriously. And then another Jen Austen book, Sense and Sensibility. Honestly, I don't even know Jen Austen wrote a book called Sense and Sensibility. Yeah, I only picked it up when I saw her name and I really liked Jen Austen. So, oh, Charlotte Bronte's Jen Air. So is that how it's pronounced? Jen Air? Okay, this is really interesting. My friend, Tess, who, I don't think she minds me mentioning her name. She's been reading this book right now and she recently, I haven't, obviously, I love, love, love Wuthering Heights. So Charlotte Bronte's sister, Emily Bronte's book, her magnum opus, let's say. And therefore, I really want to get to Jen Air, too, or the Bronte sisters. I think that they're brilliant. So from this book, she shared this quote with me and I thought it was excellent. It's exactly why I like the Bronte's, because they're so, man, I like how crude and in some sense, so violent their writing is. It just, it's so, it's such good writing. So here's a line by, I think it's Jane saying this and she says, so Tess shared this with me. She says, I am not an angel. I asserted and I will not be one till I die. I will be myself, Mr. Rochester. You must neither expect nor exact anything so let's seal off me. Let me actually change the screen so you could read it too if so let's seal off me for you will not get it any more than I shall get it of you. So this is a small excerpt from Jen Air and I kind of tweeted it and I thought that was so good. I thought it was so good and I even commented the divine feminists cringe. It's yet another patriarchal idea that harms women. I totally agree. I am not a fan of any of this idealization of women as abstract figures. In fact, that's why I like, I think, even Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights because it just shows, well, love it, it's violence, but also the characters, they're such complex characters and it shows a dark side of both Heathcliff and is it Elizabeth? My god, I forgot. Yeah, and Elizabeth, it shows both the beauty and the ugly of these characters, which for me is what great literature does. And last but not least is this book here, The Sociology Key Concepts. I'll probably never read it. It's just more like a reference book that I'll probably use it as. And yeah, that's kind of it. Those are the books for this book haul. In terms of quantity, a bit more books than per usual. The recent being is because of, again, my great little second hand book shopping thing I did with my friends, which I'm really happy about. Alrighty, thanks for watching. I hope I, as per usual, gave you a few ideas, put a few books or authors in your mind, in your head that they'll hopefully be an impetus for you to go read these authors. But just if you're into philosophy like me, I would highly, highly recommend looking into the work of Todd McGovern. He is fantastic. And he also has a podcast. Let me pull that out too, in fact, while they're added. It's on Spotify. It's called Why Theory. It is really, really good, this podcast here. Why Theory goes through so many concepts and I've kind of been binge listening. I was going to say binge watching, but it's actually binge listening, this podcast. Sorry for the abrupt ending there. I clicked stop recording on OBS by mistake. Now, the proper ending. Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next book haul video or the next video, which probably is going to be a little, little vlog slash analysis on Character Guard from this book, either or perhaps it's Magnum Opus on Bodom, which is going to be an interesting topic to discuss. Alrighty, see you in the next one. Cheers.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.72, "text": " Hey everyone, welcome to my May 2023 book haul video.
