00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Hey everyone, welcome to my February 2023 book haul video. This is a new series that I started

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,760
which is very casual, completely unscripted where I just go through the books that I've bought

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,600
for the month. I tend to do a book haul every single month and I thought, hey, why not share

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,640
what I'm buying? Hopefully it adds as an impetus or some sort of inspiration for you to read some

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,720
of these books and delve into some of these thinkers. I certainly love watching other people's

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,480
book haul videos. It's something I get a lot of just, it's kind of like eating fast food for me,

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,880
just pure stimulation and pleasure from looking at all the books that people buy because I happen

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:52,080
to be a bibliophile and fanatical one, in fact. And you know, apart from that, I'll probably

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,640
will discuss why I chose to buy this particular book in this point in my life, what's the reason

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,920
that I'm interested in this particular book or this thinker and whatnot. But again, it's nothing

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,680
planned, it's nothing scripted, it's just me, stream of consciousness just talking, that's it.

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,240
Without further ado, let's get started. So the first book is Phenomenology, The Basics by

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,720
Dan Zahavi, I believe that's how you pronounce his name. I literally found this book over at it.

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,160
I kind of went through this before, I think I got a PDF or something, but I did refer to this a

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:39,200
couple of times when I was writing a few essays. And obviously Phenomenology, a topic that I'm

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,800
deeply interested in, I think I'm essentially a phenomenologist and many other things, but that's

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:53,600
one thing I am for sure. And though it's funny, I bought this book because I'm currently writing an

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:03,360
essay that I started writing out of sheer annoyance at James Lindsay, this guy is kind of like right

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:13,120
wing anti woke person who said that all phenomenology is so he said that all leftism is just an

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,960
is a byproduct. Oh, leftism is inspired by this philosophical phenomenology, which simply asserts

21
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:28,400
that subjectivity is truth. And I saw that and I thought that is completely not true. That is

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,000
just that is that's a that's fake news. And I could really annoyed me, you can probably see even now,

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,760
I read this tweet like months ago, but even now I got totally annoyed by that because it's a complete

24
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,360
caricature and mischaracterization of what phenomenology is. And therefore I started writing

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,640
this essay called what phenomenology is not. So I want to kind of try to understand phenomenology

26
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,280
by what what it isn't. I feel like it's funny. I think the more I've started to delve into

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,560
philosophy and theory, I've realized that sometimes the best way to grok a concept and understand a

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,440
concept is by stating what it isn't, instead of stating what it is. In some sense, even at least

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,160
for me, it kind of sits better in my mind. So I bought this book, I'm certainly going to get to

30
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:27,520
this soon. And the reason is because I want to hopefully publish that publish that essay,

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,240
perhaps in about two months, because I'm working on another one right now, got too many, too many

32
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,120
essays pulling me from all sides. And you know, I'm really not getting anything done,

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,320
unfortunately. That's just something that I tend to worry about quite a lot.

34
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,760
Ah, the pleasures. So that's why I bought this book. It's in fact to write an essay. I want to get

35
00:03:51,760 --> 00:04:02,640
through all the basics as the name suggests. And my next book is an event perhaps a biography of

36
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,320
Jacques Darida by Peter Salomon, a Salomon, sorry, not not Salomon, Peter Salomon. And

37
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:16,640
this was recommended by R.C. Walden, if I could find the video where he did recommend the book.

38
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,880
So I think it was called R.C. Walden, Continental Philosophy or something. Let me see if I could

39
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,120
find the video. So I love watching R.C. Robin, that's his name, Robin's videos.

40
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,240
David, you have five interesting philosophy books, Continental Edition,

41
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,400
and he recommended the book. I'm pretty sure he recommended this book.

42
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:51,920
Yes, and even perhaps. So I kind of want to get into Darida and kind of post structuralist

43
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,680
way of thinking. I really at the moment just have like a very, very extremely peripheral,

44
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,840
almost caricatured version of what post structuralism is. And I thought something,

45
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,080
something I really enjoy is, you know, as Nietzsche said, all philosophy is a philosopher's

46
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,360
biography is even before delving into the philosopher, just sorry, the philosophy,

47
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,840
trying getting an idea from where the philosopher's coming from, which is rather

48
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,880
antithetical to what Heidegger said about Aristotle, that he was just someone who was born,

49
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,640
philosophers and died. No, I actually am interested in the philosopher. I don't know why, but

50
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,280
that's who I am. I generally am interested in the thinker and the background as to what,

51
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,640
the background in which the philosophy sits. So not just the thinker itself,

52
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,120
but even the context, the historical context, the culture period, all of that.

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,920
So yeah, I'm kind of getting into this. I probably will get down with this first before

54
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,960
getting into this because this is a small, well, I'm assuming it's a bit of a lie to read compared

55
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,920
to like reading theory, say, because it's a biography. But anyway, that's that. The next one

56
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,440
is was a gift. It was Far From the Madden Crowd by Thomas Hardy. I don't own any books by Thomas,

57
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,240
I think at least I don't think I do. And I kind of want to read Thomas Hardy, just like a light

58
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,680
read. I love reading philosophy, but at the same time, I really do want to read a lot more fiction.

59
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:34,160
But man, I'm just such a theory nerd, you know, I can't help myself. I probably read like one

60
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,320
work. I probably like read like one novel, but even that, like if I read Dostoevsky, for instance,

61
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,000
I want to read it from like a philosophical lens. I can't just read it as a book or as a work of fiction

62
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,800
because I'm such a theory nerd. But nonetheless, this is a book was recommended by a few friends.

63
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
I hope that it was quite good. And I hope that it kind of goes into

64
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:05,200
as the what's this called bibliography state, so vividly portraying the

65
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,160
superstitions and traditions of a small, rural community far from the madden crowd

66
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,760
shows the precarious position of a woman in a man's world. So it certainly seems interesting.

67
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:26,400
And then this book. Now, The Ethics of Ambiguity by Simone de Beauvoir. Of course, everyone knows

68
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,480
who Simone de Beauvoir is, at least anyone who's marginally interested in philosophy.

69
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,760
Simone de Beauvoir, of course, is known for her magnum opus, the second sex, but

70
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,400
a lot of YouTubers, in fact, philosophy YouTubers that I deeply respect, have recommended this

71
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,840
book because at least from my understanding, I think Simone de Beauvoir has a much more

72
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,640
reasonable, let's say, or I haven't got the word for it, but let's just say

73
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,680
realistic and take that word with a grain of salt. I don't know if that's a proper word.

74
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:13,600
Realistic, let's say like encapsulation of reality, if that makes sense, or what life is

75
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,960
for a human being, for a design. Because you know, Jean-Paul Sartre, he kind of

76
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,120
has this idea of like the transcendent consciousness that is free-floating,

77
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,720
consciousness everywhere. But given that Simone de Beauvoir was a woman in a time where I believe

78
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,360
when she was writing, women couldn't even work without getting permission from men or something.

79
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:43,200
But even in France, it was a very progressive country for the time. Nonetheless,

80
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,400
she lived in a deeply patriarchal system. Therefore, her understanding,

81
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,000
her understanding of what it means to exist in the world, especially being a woman,

82
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,720
I think is a lot more realistic because she talks about this kind of contradiction between

83
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,680
being a free being, but also the fact that we are, in fact, in a structure, in a society,

84
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,960
in a historical period, we also have this kind of, there's a word by

85
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,440
po-to-lik, there's a term by po-to-lik. Let me try to look it up because I just referred to it.

86
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,480
It's in this, oh, I think it was masculinity and nothingness. Yes, so in this essay I did quote

87
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:44,080
po-to-lik. Let me see if I could find it. Man is essentially finite freedom. This idea of finite

88
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:54,400
freedom, that doesn't mean we're not free, but our freedom comes within a certain structure that,

89
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:01,440
in some sense, makes the freedom infinity. It's not like this free-floating Sartrean consciousness

90
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,840
that we just can do whatever we want. Perhaps Sartre wrote from a position of privilege,

91
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:14,320
being a man in France in his time. Simone de Beauvoir had a different experience being a woman.

92
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:24,240
This book beautifully captures that ambiguity to existence, this kind of almost antagonism

93
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,320
of what it means to be human, and then, of course, the ethical and moral implications that come from

94
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,920
it. So I'm really keen to get into this. This is probably going to go right to the top of my list

95
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:44,880
of books to read. Perhaps once I'm done with this one, because I'm writing an essay, I'll probably

96
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,280
get on this. So suddenly excited to read The Ethics of Pembergute by Simone de Beauvoir.

97
00:10:52,080 --> 00:11:00,800
And then comes the next one. So it's This Big Boy, Less Than Nothing by my hero,

98
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:08,720
Slavoj Džek. This is a book that I will jump into this year for sure. The reason being,

99
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:16,160
this year I kind of set myself a goal in terms of my education and my studying

100
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:28,160
in philosophy. It was to deeply study two of, well, I would say the two main thinkers that

101
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,880
have influenced my life to this moment in the deepest possible way. Portolek and, of course,

102
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:42,160
Slavoj Džek. So studying these two thinkers, of course, means studying all the other thinkers

103
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,400
that influenced them. So it's a huge project that I've set for myself. And I want to embark on it.

104
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:55,600
And I'm kind of already embarked on it, let's say. And that means going through essentially

105
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,520
the magnum opuses. So for Portolek it would be, I probably would be systematic theology,

106
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,200
the monograph. It's got three volumes. And I own it too. I just am slowly getting through that.

107
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,000
But then for Slavoj Džek, a lot of people who read Džek quite deeply recommend this book

108
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,120
and the parallax view. So this is his book on Hegel. Hegel and the shadow of dialectical

109
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,280
materialism. So this is certainly something I'm going to jump into soon because I won't

110
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,640
get a better understanding of Hegel. I don't know. It's funny. I just had a conversation with

111
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,040
P.F. Young, a great guy, Paul. And I realized that I was trying to explain to him the Hegelian

112
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,360
triad. And I think I totally butchered it. I wasn't even sure if I should take that bit out

113
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,760
because I didn't want to misrepresent Hegel. But I just thought, hey, look, it's a conversation.

114
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,040
We were just chatting. It was really casual. So if I'm just spewing bullshit,

115
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,320
someone will correct me and if I'm not, I'll hopefully correct myself sometime in the future

116
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,480
when I have a better understanding of Hegel. So definitely I'm going to work on this. In fact,

117
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:14,240
if it's possible, it's a big boy. I might even do a lecture series on this book

118
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:22,320
if it's within my capacity because, man, it's a lot to get through. The next one is

119
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Religion and Nothingness by Nishitani, Keiji Nishitani. Of course, a book that

120
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,600
John Oveiki has recommended many times. In fact, in his latest lecture series, which is

121
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:46,000
what was it? After Socrates, is it? Oveiki. Yes, in his lecture series,

122
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:55,440
I think in episode five, he states that this was in the top five books that he's read.

123
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,000
And John Oveiki is also someone I really like. I really enjoy listening to his work.

124
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,800
Despite interestingly, I think theoretically, his point of views or his understanding of reality

125
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,040
is a lot more different to the other thinker that I would consider myself a Zhezhekian.

126
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:26,240
So, Zhezhek and John Oveiki probably have this fundamental conflict in their theories.

127
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,840
It's interesting just to go for a bit of a tangent here. I think a lot of the modern debate

128
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:41,440
between different intellectuals is kind of between Freud, and then there's Jung, and then there's

129
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,640
Lacan. And I think it's between these three thinkers. So, everyone influenced by Freud,

130
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,440
Jung, Lacan, they go their own way and create their own philosophies. And that's where the conflict

131
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,440
lies. So, John Oveiki would probably be more of a union, less than a Freudian, and then

132
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,720
Zhezhek would be more of a Freudian and Lacanian. So, or Lacanian. So, that's where the conflict lies.

133
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,280
Nonetheless, just thinking out loud here. The next book is Capital by Thomas Piketty.

134
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:24,640
I listened to a recent episode on Pillspawd. I love this channel so much. I don't know the

135
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:32,480
guy's real name. I don't think he probably goes by his pseudonym online, Pillspawd. And they

136
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:41,120
had this episode where they talk about, it's called the idea of communism. It's very interesting. It

137
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,880
was in fact done on a, I believe, an event that Alan Baizho and a few other thinkers, you know,

138
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,040
mainstream leftists, or the popular leftist intellectuals of our time, got together and

139
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,680
discussed the idea of communism. So, it's important to understand here. It's the word idea. That's

140
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,080
the concept of communism. It's not about the practical implementations. Different thing.

141
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:09,360
And they did mention this book. Not Pillspawd, but another guest on the podcast did mention

142
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,680
this book, Capital by Thomas Piketty. And I know it's another big one. I don't know if I'll get

143
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,320
into it this year. Hopefully. Definitely, I want to first get through the next book on Hegel.

144
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,160
But maybe after that, I'll get into this book. And the reason I like it is because,

145
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,200
as much as I love philosophy and concepts, I also do look for, you know, practical material

146
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,440
implementations of these concepts. It's something, you know, I think, as a person who's politically

147
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,080
involved has to think about, it can't all be philosophizing at one point. It has to be

148
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,560
implementation. This is perhaps my engineering side coming in. And they discussed that Thomas Piketty

149
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:57,120
just gives some very tangible, practical solutions as to how we can live in a post-capitalist

150
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,320
society. As to how we can implement new systems that make society more egalitarian and ensure

151
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:11,040
that there's less suffering in this world. And it's a new way of thinking about capital,

152
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,840
as the name suggests, in the 21st century, because we do live in a post-capitalist society.

153
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:21,680
And I think society is, you know, I mean, over here, I'm a complete jirkeen. I think the only

154
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,520
universal is conflict. I think the only universal is antagonism. So in some sense, in a very

155
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,200
Nietzschean way, society is about constantly recreating ourselves and then broader society.

156
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,560
There never is the good old days, nor will there ever be the utopia that some people might aspire

157
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:51,120
to have. Therefore, there never is the end of history. That never happens, as Francis Fukuyama

158
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,560
suggested. At least that's my current understanding. And that's it. Those are the books. I hope you all

159
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:06,000
enjoyed this book haul. Sorry if I'm blabbering. I kind of did that intentionally because, well,

160
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,320
this is not a scripted thing. It's just me thinking out loud here. And if there are any other books,

161
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:18,400
that you think are, let's say, tangentially related to these books that I discussed, please do leave

162
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,840
them down in the comment section. And I'll be keen to check them out and perhaps even end up buying

163
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,800
them. But thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next one, not only the next book haul, but even

164
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:36,240
in the next video, which probably, well, I've got one on my mother world, the software engineering

165
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:44,480
world where I'm doing on effective Java, which I shall record soon. And then the other one is a,

166
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,120
I'm excited for this, actually, a Twitter space that I'll be hosting, not hosting, sorry, I'll be a

167
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,040
guest in with my brother, you and go, who I'm hoping to have on the podcast soon because this guy,

168
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,720
alone to death, but also the smart bloke. So it would be interesting to have a conversation

169
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,720
with him. Cool. See you in the next one. Take care. Cheers.
