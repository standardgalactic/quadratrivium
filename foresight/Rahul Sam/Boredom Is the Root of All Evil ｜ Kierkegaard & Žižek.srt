00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Hey everyone, today we're going to discuss the idea of Bodum using the existential theories of the philosopher Soren Kerkregard,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,640
and particularly on what he's delineated in his book, Eitheror, which some would argue is his magnum opus.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:22,240
Also, sorry about the background noise, someone's mowing their lawn, just when I decided to record a video.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,680
But firstly, let me read something from the book.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,960
So here, Kerkregard is writing as the esteem, and I'll get into what that means in a bit.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,240
He says this,

7
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,200
By pressing the speed to the maximum, one need only say to oneself,

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,400
Bodum is a root of all evil.

9
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:16,040
Strange that Bodum, so still and static, should have such power to set things in motion.

10
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:24,360
The effect that Bodum exercises is altogether magical, except that it is not one of attraction, but of repulsion.

11
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:32,720
So firstly, starting off this section of Eitheror, you could see clearly Kerkregard's esteem is no fan of Bodum.

12
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,600
He literally states that we're repelled by it.

13
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,720
But it's important to understand this before we get to exploring this idea of Bodum via the lens of Kerkregard,

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,000
is that this is particularly not what Kerkregard believes, and that's really important.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,800
Because this, in my opinion, is what makes Kerkregard a brilliant philosopher.

16
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,320
You never really truly know what his beliefs are.

17
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,160
He delineates and outlines different kinds of existential theories.

18
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:12,720
And the esteem, the person who wants to live the aesthetic life, I think is in a rather uncanny way pertinent to our times.

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,400
I wouldn't say uncanny is the proper word, but in a rather interesting way, pertinent to our times,

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,720
because I'd postulate that in many ways, aren't we all esthetes?

21
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:31,520
As in, Kerkregard's esteem is a person who constantly pursues happiness and novelty that they constantly want to be titillated.

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,280
Isn't that modern society?

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,680
If you think of society, and to use a term that I heard from, in fact, I'm a Ewan,

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,600
society itself has this meta-aim, contemporary society, and that meta-aim tends to be happiness.

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,040
So if you go to a person and ask, why do you work?

26
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
You could say, I'm working for money.

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,200
And then you ask, why do you want to make money?

28
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Or I'm making, I want to make money to be financially free.

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,120
Or I want to, you know, for starters, most people, unfortunately, would say, I'm making money just to survive.

30
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,040
And that's the harsh, crude reality of the world we live in.

31
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,560
People simply want to get by.

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,320
But at the same time, let's say people that are a bit more well-off, a bit more middle-class, a bit more bourgeois.

33
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,640
If you keep questioning what the purpose of what they're doing is, at one point,

34
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,880
what happiness comes up.

35
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm making money to be more happy.

36
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,480
I'm making more money to travel the world, experience new things, have novelty.

37
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,120
And for Kierkegaard, this is the esteem.

38
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,040
Now, he doesn't place any moral judgment on being an esteem.

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:42,280
It's simply, again, as I kind of touched on before, is a mode of life, an existential mode of life, a state of being.

40
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:56,160
And the esteem constantly pursues the new thing, be it sex, be it women, be it flirting, be it money, be it alcohol, drugs,

41
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,040
or on the other side, what some would call high culture, intellectual work.

42
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:10,160
What I'm doing right now is, in some ways, an aesthetic act, or beauty and art, or classical music,

43
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,120
or indulge oneself in being titillated by such things.

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,720
Nevertheless, it's still taking real pleasure in the aesthetic life.

45
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
And that's what the esteem is.

46
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:29,640
And I think, for our times, again, to not to repeat myself, the esteem's mode of living is germane.

47
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,720
But here's the way I bring in Zhezhek.

48
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,280
It's not just that we are esteem because we spontaneously, deep in our covenants and authentic sense,

49
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,040
want to be an estate, that this is the kind of aesthetic life.

50
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:49,840
Rather, in many ways, the moral imperative, the injunction by society is to enjoy, to live your best life.

51
00:04:49,840 --> 00:05:00,000
And two ways of thinking about it is the typical kind of crude 1960s madmen style, where, oh, it's about sex, drugs, money, women.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,760
It's just being the typical consumer, making more money so it can consume more.

53
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,680
That's the very crude way that we kind of think of how consumerism, for instance, works.

54
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:17,000
Buy this thing, buy this product, and that'll fulfill your desires, that'll make you happy,

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,080
and keep going to the next one, to the next one, kind of like the Jay-Z's song.

56
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:33,040
But of course, the other side of the same coin is a bit more subtle, but the kind of new age aesthetic life,

57
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,000
self-actualization, live your best life.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,280
People who obsess over self-help and productivity and mindfulness.

59
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,680
And I hate this term because it's really overused.

60
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,960
Well-being, well-being.

61
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,880
You hear Sam Harris types constantly talk about it.

62
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,400
It's important to meditate.

63
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,360
People obsess over listening to Andrew Huberman's, optimizing your health.

64
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,240
And then, of course, there's more of the positive psychology, which is like pop positive psychology.

65
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,800
Focus on being your best self.

66
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,080
And then the kind of new age, spiritualist type is divine, feminine, divine, masculine.

67
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,800
I'm one with the universe, which, unfortunately, in other words, the two-carrier way has a strain of fascism to it, too.

68
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:25,600
But all these things, all these things, the kind of crude consumerism and even the new age self-actualization,

69
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,480
I put it all on the umbrella of character-guards aesthetic life.

70
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,920
And if you read, so the book, either or, it's a dialectical book.

71
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:41,920
If you read the either, which is on the aesthetic, you'll see so much of what character-guards writing about in the 1840s remarkably applies to our times,

72
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:49,440
specifically our times, or especially our times, given the kind of stage of capitalism we are in right now.

73
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:59,960
And I'm not pointing or like blaming everything on capitalism in a way I kind of am, but a lot of our culture, the way we live,

74
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,080
it's influenced by the ideological impositions of neoliberal capitalism.

75
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,880
I'll leave it there, but it's a bit more complicated.

76
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,480
But I'll put it like this, and I think that's the point Ja'Jak makes.

77
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,080
He states that the super ego imperative is to enjoy.

78
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,160
The traditional notion of psychoanalysis is that because of some inner obstacles,

79
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,280
you internalized, identified excessively, excessively with paternal or other social prohibitions,

80
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,480
you cannot set yourself free to enjoy, to pleasure is not accessible for you.

81
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,480
It is accessible to you only in pathological forms of feeling guilty and so on.

82
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:49,160
So then the idea is psychoanalysis allows you to suspend, overcome these internalized prohibitions so that it enables you to enjoy.

83
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:56,760
The problem today is that the commandment of the ruling ideologies enjoy in different ways.

84
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:04,440
It can be sexual enjoyment, consumption, commodity enjoyment, up to spiritual enjoyment, realize yourself, whatever.

85
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:13,080
And I think that the problem today is not how to get rid of your inhibitions and to be able to spontaneously enjoy.

86
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,360
The problem is how to get rid of this injunction to enjoy.

87
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,120
So it's because of this super ego imperative that we have to enjoy.

88
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,040
In many ways, we are forced to be esthetes in the modern world.

89
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,240
If we need to understand what Kedrican means about the aesthetic life,

90
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,920
or particularly for this video, the idea of boredom and exploit via the aesthetic lens,

91
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,440
because again, I am beating on a dead horse here, we in many ways are all esthetes.

92
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,560
In the book, in this part of the book, he continues saying, he says,

93
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,520
OK, the quintessential example is to think of children.

94
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,440
We all think of children.

95
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,520
And what happens when children are bored?

96
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,480
They generally get up to no good.

97
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,120
You know, we hear terms of, you know, teenage illinquency,

98
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,800
or we see all these statistics, sociological statistics about when kids have nothing to do, they get up to no good.

99
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,520
And he says, this is a clear indicator that being boredom is repulsive.

100
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,440
It's not a good thing.

101
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,080
It's in fact the root of all evil as the esthetes writes as Kedrican.

102
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm going to keep saying, as Kedrican writes, because it's kind of confusing to mix them together.

103
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,040
It's kind of something fun about reading Kedrican, because you never really know

104
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,960
which who he's writing as, because he's got so many synonyms and different ways of explaining existence.

105
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,880
And then he goes on by saying that, oh, look, the fact that children behave in such way

106
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,240
when they're bored is the reason that boredom is a problem.

107
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,880
And then he states, what wounded them that the world is regressing, that evil is gaining ground more and more,

108
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,280
since boredom is on the increase and boredom is a root of all evil.

109
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:01,760
And then with the stroke of genius, I would say, Kedrican predicts this pathological obsession we all have with being productive,

110
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,320
or with wanting to always be busy, which one would say is the ideology of productivism.

111
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,800
So I kind of touched on this a bit before.

112
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,600
I was talking about people like Andrew Huberman or all these, you know, the myriad self-help productivity gurus on YouTube.

113
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
And again, they have a place, a certain place.

114
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,880
But what happens is that what people apply to their lives to be more productive

115
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:34,840
or to try and kind of be a bit more efficient, the part replaces the whole.

116
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,880
That's all they become.

117
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,960
They all become people who need to optimize everything.

118
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:44,360
And it comes to a point where where everything, including things like love and family and intimacy,

119
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:54,920
all these things are viewed through the lens of productivism, ticking off boxes and making the most out of the time you have in for a day.

120
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,960
And for Kedrican, that is that is he kind of in a very sadonic way.

121
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,760
He mocks it and he says that that is not the way we humans are.

122
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:12,280
We humans, you know, are not machines and we don't have to constantly live this hyper productive, optimized life.

123
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,360
So he's very sadonic about it.

124
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,680
And he says something like this.

125
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,920
There are people with an extraordinary gift for transforming everything into a business whose whole life is business.

126
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:35,840
To fall in love and marry, listen to a joke and admire a work of art with the same zealous sense of affairs, which they work in the office.

127
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:45,320
Isn't that so interesting because I've recently been seeing on Twitter of people posting these long Google Docs, Google Docs or long Google Docs documents.

128
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
There we go.

129
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,280
Long Google Documents with sort of like checklists on reasons to date me.

130
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,400
So even love has become like a kind of business interaction or a business transaction.

131
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:10,000
And then of course, dating apps, dating apps is perhaps in our times the quintessential example of how we commodify other people and we kind of, you know, check the boxes and see our interactions become.

132
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:24,640
Yeah, again, at a very kind of a transactional level, the same way we go to the supermarket and buy, let's say, I don't know, some can of tuna and you got all these myriad options.

133
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,720
We treat other human beings the same way.

134
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,200
But of course, that's not how love works.

135
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,320
Love doesn't work where you pick the best from the rest.

136
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,400
It's rather it's in retrospect, you pick someone and then you make them the best from your own choice.

137
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,720
Hold on to the conversation.

138
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:51,400
But the point being, again, KKGOT sees how once we start living in a certain way where we repel boredom, we repel not making the best use of our time.

139
00:12:51,400 --> 00:13:01,400
And we think that's kind of like a sin because, again, our moral injunction or the super ego commandment is to live your best life.

140
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,040
Then everything has to be optimized.

141
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,600
We all have to be pathologically obsessed with being productive.

142
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,360
And then he continues.

143
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,640
And here's where he's being a bit sadonic, which I love.

144
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,320
So all people are boring.

145
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,600
The word itself indicates the possibility of a subdivision.

146
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,160
Boring can describe a person who boasts others as well as one who boasts himself.

147
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,920
Those who both others are the general plebians, the mass, the endless strain of humanity in general.

148
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,200
Those who both themselves are the elect, the nobility, and how strange it is that, and I love this line,

149
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:45,200
how strange it is that those who don't bow themselves usually bow others, while those who bow themselves amuse others.

150
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,600
The people who do not bow themselves are generally those who are busy in the world, in one way or another.

151
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,600
But that is just why they are the most boring, the most insufferable of all.

152
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,800
And I thought that was really interesting because if you think about it, it's kind of like the argument.

153
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,200
In fact, I've got the book right here.

154
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Makuza makes in his book One-Dimensional Man that when people become these kind of hyper-optimized, you know, productivity robots,

155
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
they in fact do become very one-dimensional.

156
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:26,200
All their life entails is a life of optimizing one's finances, optimizing one's time, living this very to-do-less space life.

157
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
And I am guilty as charged. I happen to be one of them.

158
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,200
In fact, I would say it's really interesting because I was with a girl for a while.

159
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I was dating a girl for a few months and probably one reason we broke up was she was the opposite of me.

160
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
She was very good at relaxing and not doing anything.

161
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
So I think it certainly is a bit of a personality trait too.

162
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Although I don't want to get into psychology and psychologize Kegelgaard's philosophy here, I think it's more of a cultural phenomenon where, yes,

163
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
we all have this desire, this yearning to constantly be productive.

164
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:06,200
And I think the point Kegelgaard makes here is that when all our life is treated like a business, as he's stated here,

165
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,200
then we kind of lose this spirit of what it means to be human.

166
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:17,200
We lose this kind of, I don't even know, in a way we stop being human.

167
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
We become an automaton.

168
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,200
And it's even an interesting Marxist critique of modern society.

169
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
People like that generally seem to be quite boring.

170
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I find people who are hyper-obsessed with self-help the most boring, artificial people in the world

171
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,200
because it seems that everything in their life is architected, it's contrived,

172
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:45,200
and I find that to be, yes, as he writes, rather boring and insufferable.

173
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,200
But seeing all that, in the middle of this section, Kegelgaard takes a bit of a turn and he states this,

174
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,200
and afterwards I'll expand on what he means here, which at least my reading of what he's trying to state here.

175
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
He states,

176
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
It is usually said, is a root of all evil.

177
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
To prevent this evil, one recommends work.

178
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,200
However, it is easy to see from the remedy as well as the fear it caused,

179
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,200
that this whole view is of very plebeian extraction.

180
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Idleness as such is by no means a root of evil.

181
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Quite the contrary, it is a truly divine way of life, so long as one is not born.

182
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Certainly, idleness may lead you to lose your fortune and so on,

183
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,200
but of such things, the man of noble nature has no fear.

184
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
What he fears is boredom.

185
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
The Olympian gods were not bored.

186
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:46,200
They pondered in happy idleness, oh sorry, they prospered in happy idleness.

187
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:53,200
A beauty who neither soothes nor spends, nor irons nor reads, nor makes music as happy in her idleness,

188
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
for she is not bored.

189
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,200
So far from idleness being the root of all evil, rather it is the true good.

190
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,200
The root of all evil is boredom, and that is what must be kept at bay.

191
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Idleness is not evil.

192
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Indeed, one can say that any human who lacks appreciation of it,

193
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
proves that he has not raised himself to the level of humanity.

194
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,200
So at last line, I kind of was kind of what I was trying to articulate,

195
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,200
that in many ways, becoming this kind of one-dimensional person,

196
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
you lose a part of what it means to be human,

197
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,200
or you don't raise yourself to the level of humanity one could add.

198
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Okay, so in the paragraph I read, what's Krikgad saying?

199
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,200
My reading is that, of course, as even Bertrand Russell,

200
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,200
who probably comes from a very different tradition, more of the analytical tradition states,

201
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
idleness is not a bad thing.

202
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Idleness, in fact, is a good thing to be human.

203
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
We humans need a bit of idle time.

204
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,200
As perhaps Nietzsche said, old great ideas come to us when we are walking in walks.

205
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,200
So we need time that is just time spent without any, it's purposeless time.

206
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,200
It's time not, it's not resting so you could recuperate and do more work.

207
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,200
It's rather the subtle art of nothingness, of idleness.

208
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,200
And in fact, in modern society, as I've touched on, we simply don't have to be idle.

209
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,200
We simply don't have time to be idle anymore, although we are essentially both.

210
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Now, I'll explain what I mean by essentially both a bit later,

211
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,200
because as we read this section, what you see is Krikgad delineates

212
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,200
that boredom is an ontological category.

213
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
It's intrinsic to being human.

214
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
We can't get rid of it.

215
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
We can't jettison it from our existence.

216
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
And that's the problem.

217
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,200
The problem is that since boredom, despite as he states, or the esteemed states,

218
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,200
is the root of all evil, despite that it still is a part of who we are.

219
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
We, in a very fundamental sense, are bored.

220
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,200
But while we are bored, we don't have time to be idle,

221
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,200
which Krikgad views, or the esteemed views as a virtue that idleness is a good thing.

222
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
I would agree.

223
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Sometimes the most sublime ideas, the most sublime things happen when we are being idle.

224
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,200
It could even be a random interaction with a stranger that happens when we are really not getting up to anything

225
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,200
and not really rushing to the next thing or the next task.

226
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:35,200
But of course, the problem is because of our current societal ideology of be productive, be busy,

227
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,200
make the best use of your time, and then the other much more, I would say, dark side of things

228
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,200
where people simply don't have time to relax anymore as they simply have to put food on the table.

229
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Just to get by, people are always working, taking multiple jobs.

230
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Idleness is going away.

231
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,200
It's left our existence while we are also fundamentally bored.

232
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,200
There are subtle differences, but they are on the same thing.

233
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Idleness is something at a very practical level that we need to incorporate into our lives,

234
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
whereas boredom, it is existential.

235
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,200
It's constitutive of what it means to be human.

236
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,200
In fact, in the book, it stated quite interestingly, we can trace this, so when he means this, he means boredom,

237
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
from the very beginning of the world.

238
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
The gods were bored, so they created man.

239
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Adam was bored because he was alone, so Eve was created.

240
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,200
From that time, boredom entered the world and grew in exact proportion to the growth of the population.

241
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Adam was bored alone, then Adam and Eve were bored in union, then Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel were bored on famil,

242
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,200
then the population increased, and the peoples were bored on mass.

243
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,200
So my reading of that little bit is that the estate is saying, despite him despising boredom,

244
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
despite him finding it repulsive, we can't get rid of it.

245
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,200
At least for the estate, it's kind of like a predicament.

246
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,200
It's not something we can just choose not to have in our lives.

247
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
It's a part of being human.

248
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Then he states, this is the problem when we don't have time to be idle,

249
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,200
which is kind of like a practical thing being incorporated into our lives,

250
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,200
but we are still bored, it leads to meaninglessness.

251
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,200
I think that's where it becomes like a social phenomena,

252
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,200
where people have a mental health crisis as a term,

253
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,200
a neologism coined by social psychologists called deaths by despair.

254
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:40,200
It's simply people dying from unhappiness, not simply it's tragically people dying from unhappiness.

255
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:47,200
And for CricketGuard, one reason for this would be because we haven't acknowledged the fact that in the core of who we are,

256
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,200
in some sense this void of boredom, and it's there,

257
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,200
and he puts it beautifully here, he says,

258
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,200
boredom rests upon the nothingness that winds its way through existence, its diddiness,

259
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,200
like that which comes from gazing down into an infinite abyss, is infinite.

260
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,200
So you can see from that little line there how thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre were influenced by CricketGuard quite interestingly.

261
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,200
So we need to be able to acknowledge this boredom being a part of our ontological condition.

262
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,200
And then, and then what? And the question is then what?

263
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Given the fact that yes, boredom, for the assiduous evil, and what do we do from there?

264
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,200
CricketGuard, for better or worse, and for my belief is that for better, he is not a self-op author,

265
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,200
so he doesn't really write prescriptive texts except perhaps as more of his religious writing.

266
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:45,200
The fact of the matter is there really isn't no remedy or panacea to the fact that boredom to the core is a part of who we are,

267
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,200
although one thing that helps in understanding that is that then we acknowledge it

268
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,200
and then we also understand that idleness per se isn't a bad thing.

269
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:04,200
And in fact, we should probably make time and not listen to the societal imperatives or societal injunctions

270
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
to constantly do something and allow ourselves to be idle.

271
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
But that doesn't mean any of that is prescriptive and that's not the purpose of this video either.

272
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
I don't give advice on this channel.

273
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:23,200
But to kind of end it on a let's say a positive note, what is the solution to this dilemma, this predicament we are in?

274
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,200
The fact that we are ontologically bored, it's innate to who we are and that we don't have time to be idle,

275
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,200
therefore we have this emptiness and void in the middle of our lives.

276
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,200
And what is the solution to compulsive pathological business?

277
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Now, of course, look, I could give the typical self-advice or kind of discuss, you know, or take time,

278
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:55,200
have me time in your calendar, lock out me time, I don't know, meditate, go for walks, you know, partake in self-care things.

279
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Those are great, do all of that.

280
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
I do most of those things, I exercise, I run, I don't meditate, I hate meditating,

281
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,200
but I do engage in these things because they're great.

282
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
It's important to take care of your health.

283
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,200
But for me, still, those are rather superficial things.

284
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:19,200
What I've found personally is that the kind of the remedy to, I wouldn't even call it a remedy, not the perfect remedy,

285
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,200
but what helps me cope with this existential dread, let's say, or this nappingness, this void of boredom,

286
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:34,200
is to deeply fall in love with the world, to deeply, not to do the whole Western Buddhist thing where you detach yourself from the world

287
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
and be like, oh, everything's a cosmic phenomenon.

288
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
No, no, no.

289
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Attach yourself more to the world, care more about the world, and find something you deeply care about.

290
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,200
For me, it happens to be writing, philosophy, politics.

291
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:54,200
These are things that I would go to the ends of my existence to deeply go all the way in some sense.

292
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,200
And I think that's the only antidote to this boredom we have in existence.

293
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,200
It's not playing this middle game where you do a bit of everything, but rather finding something that's like an infinite passion

294
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:15,200
that takes you all the way to the end, to the point where, in fact, when you truly care about a certain vocation,

295
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:22,200
let's say, be it a scientist, a political activist, an engineer, an artist, a philosopher,

296
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,200
you would sacrifice your own world for that course, for the vocation.

297
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,200
If you're building something, if you're writing a book, if you're partaking in some kind of political movement,

298
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,200
especially, I would say, if you're partaking in some kind of political movement,

299
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:43,200
you would sacrifice your well-being, your happiness, which the estate would find that repulsive.

300
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
You would sacrifice all of that for the course.

301
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,200
And I think that is the only way to exist in this world.

302
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:54,200
It's not through taking this kind of middle ground and trying to optimize everything in your life.

303
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:05,200
I think that's a lie sold to us so that we can, in fact, be suckers and buy more things off the market.

304
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,200
And of course, for many people, this comes in the form of family.

305
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
That is certainly something you can commit yourself to.

306
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:23,200
But the point being, I don't think, I think the worst thing one could do with Bodum is to ignore it, repress it,

307
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:35,200
don't look into it, and just take on many things in life and just drown yourself with tasks or businesses to use a word credit card.

308
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:42,200
I don't mean business in the economic transactional sense, but rather in always doing things and not obviously be idle.

309
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,200
My view one should confront that Bodum is a part of who we are.

310
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,200
It's considerative to our existence.

311
00:26:49,200 --> 00:27:00,200
And then, then kind of go all the way, go all the way, find something that will, that will, that will not just wake you up in the morning,

312
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,200
but even keep you up late at night to the point where it's in fact bad for you.

313
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
And I think that's where passion lies.

314
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Passion, for me, much like Bodum, passion itself is a, it's a, it's a, it's what it means to be human.

315
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,200
You will achieve the level of humanity when you truly are passionate about something.

316
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
And at least that's what I believe.

317
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
But again, I'm not being prescriptive here.

318
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,200
I found that for me, that's the only way to live.

319
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
It's life of passion.

320
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Thanks for watching.

321
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Hope you found that useful.

322
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Cheers.
