0	4400	Okay, so to get the ball rolling, as they say, I'm going to read off
6400	13200	Adiga's, uh, the question concerning technology, although, although it's very important, a caveat,
13200	18560	Adiga was a serious Nazi. So whenever you read him, you need to have that in the back of your mind.
18560	24160	He wasn't some kind of peripheral Nazi. No, no, no, he was deeply involved with the Nazi party.
24160	30400	He was an ideological Nazi. And, you know, I even read this good analysis of Adiga that in many
30400	38640	ways he was a metaphysical and SMI, not just the kind of the, you know, run-of-the-mill and SMI
38640	43520	in Germany during World War II. He was a legit and SMI. So it was a Nazi. So whenever we read him,
44160	51200	we need to keep that in mind. Regardless, I personally think one of his best essays I've ever
51200	59120	read is the question concerning technology, which he does an analysis, a metaphysical analysis of
59120	67440	technology. So I'm going to read really two tiny excerpts from that essay, and then we'll go from
67440	76960	there. So here's what he says. Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology.
77920	85440	Whether we passionately affirm or deny it, but we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way
85440	92000	when we regard it as something neutral. So that's a really important point. For this conception of it,
92000	98720	to which today we are particularly like to pay homage, make us utterly blind to the essence of
98720	103280	technology. This is essentially in the second paragraph of the essay. So he starts off like
103440	107600	that. And then this is the important bit for me, at least, which I thought was really
108000	116080	perspicacious. He says, yeah, we're questioning concerning technology, and we have arrived now
116080	121600	at alater, which is a Greek term, which means, well, it translates to add revealing.
123040	129520	What has the essence of technology to do with revealing? The answer, everything. For every
129600	137760	bringing forth is grounded in revealing. Bringing forth indeed gathers within itself
138480	144800	the four modes of occasioning, causality, and the rules, and rules them through throughout.
144800	148400	So the four modes he discusses as in his essay, we don't know how to get to that,
148400	150320	but the important bit is about revealing.
151040	161360	What's that? He writes in such a weird way, man. It's so hard to read how to go.
161360	169840	Within its domain, belong and means as well as instrumentality. Okay. I don't know what the
169840	175600	sentence means. Ignore that. Instrumentality is considered to be the fundamental characteristic
175600	183600	of technology. If we inquire step by step what technology represented as means actually is,
184800	191280	then we shall arrive at revealing. The possibility of all productive manufacturing
191280	195600	lies in revealing. And now this is perhaps the most important little excerpt.
196800	204800	Technology is therefore no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing. If we give heat to this,
204880	209520	then another whole realm for the essence of technology will open itself up to us.
210320	217360	It is in the realm of revealing, i.e. of truth. So after reading this a couple of times, my first
217360	224160	insight and the way I connected this to kind of techno-optimism and tech bros of our time is,
226000	232320	I feel like a lot of us, at least tacitly, view technology as a means to an end. A lot of tech
232320	237120	bros think of it as some kind of, as Heidegger says, instrumentality. It's a way to get things
237120	244560	done purely pragmatic, utilitarian kind of way of viewing. However, actually I have some notes here
244560	251760	which I took down. That bit about instrument, sorry, that bit about revealing shows that
251760	259280	technology is not a mere instrument. It's rather a way that truth reveals itself to us. And when I
259280	264320	mean truth, I don't mean truth in like a scientific empirical sense, like facts of, let's say, the
264320	271440	physical world, but rather truths of being as such. So the brilliant insight Heidegger had
271440	276720	in the 20th century, which I think revolutionized philosophy afterwards, at least so-called
276720	281360	colonial philosophy, is that he showed that, you know, truth isn't something that just
282560	287520	kind of prima facie just presents itself to us. It's always something that's revealed through
287520	294560	us, a subject, or as he calls it, a design. And then he used that kind of concept that truth is always
295760	300880	something that's filtered through a framework or framework, again, reduces it to some kind of like
300880	305920	algorithm. It's not in that sense. Rather, it's a, through a mode of being, through an orientation,
305920	312880	let's say. He extrapolated that idea to every other part of being. So technology, art,
313840	319280	obviously history and whatnot. This essays our technology. So the first thing is,
320560	326400	technology is not a means to an end. It is much more deep and much more profound. It's essence,
326400	333520	it makes metaphysical claims, which means technology deeply profoundly changes who we
333520	338000	as human beings. And that's not an eye-opener, especially with social media. People just accept
338080	344000	that kind of, now it's like, it's a given, right? Although it's not just in the sense of our social
344000	350720	reality, but our metaphysics, our values itself changes with technology. And then the other critique
350720	356000	of, let's say, tech bros or tech broism is that, you know, there's this kind of naive optimism,
356000	360640	which I'm going to talk about, where there's like this assumption we have that, oh,
361440	366880	technology is good just for the sake of technology. So it's just kind of, if we keep
368080	372400	advancing and developing our technologies, that's just good for its sake. It's not so simple.
373440	379760	What Heidegger talks about this thing called, yeah, so he has technology as revealing,
379760	384800	but then he also has this thing called enframing, which, okay, I hate to be the
384800	389200	annoying leftist that blames everything on capitalism, but I'm going to be that annoying leftist.
389200	398240	And framing us, we start viewing other human beings also as technical objects, as resources to
398240	406400	be exploited, case in point, human resources. So in that sense, the technological metaphysics
406400	412800	have become our metaphysics. We view other human beings as means to an ends, as things
412800	420400	to be optimized, utilized, to be used, to be technically exploited, certainly in capitalism.
420400	426880	And, you know, a good example is when the whole, as we are going through the current AI revolution,
426880	431680	when the whole, you know, with open AI, a judge if anything came off, the first question, a lot of
432720	439600	the first kind of spontaneous reaction most people have is, oh, what's it going to do to this job,
439600	444160	to marketing that job? What's it going to do to the economy? But rarely did we ask,
444800	450240	what is it going to do to the human subject as such? And I think the reason we asked that
450240	454720	previous question, not the latter one, the reason we asked, oh, what's it going to do to our economy?
454720	461360	What's it going to do to, I don't know, different kinds of jobs is because again, we human beings,
461360	467760	because we have this kind of technical metaphysics, we view human beings as agents of capital.
467760	474400	Simply, that's all we have. We just, you know, we trade and we pretty much move around capital.
474960	480560	So the most important thing isn't the human being, but what the human being is useful.
481840	487520	And that's my critique of tech bros, who kind of, they have this kind of like
487520	492640	massive optimism where technology will liberate us. It's typically on a tower of
492640	496880	Babel from the Bible, right? Typically, it'll liberate us. It'll be a saving grace.
497600	502960	And it's good just for its sake. And in many ways, the human being doesn't even matter what
502960	509120	matters is the technology as such. And that is something. So by the way, Heidegger was not
509120	513280	a Luddite. He was not saying technology is bad. I think the best way to read Heidegger is through
513280	519760	the Hegelian lens and be like, okay, we need to see technology for what it is with its
519760	524560	contradictions. And I'm not saying that's, oh, you see the good and bad and you kind of weigh
524560	529040	out the pros and cons and get the pros. It doesn't work like that. Heidegger's point is more,
529920	536480	more, I'd say more solemn even, that we, with the good, the bad comes,
538240	542960	the bad comes along. It's concomitant to the good. We can't have our cake and eat it too.
542960	547120	That's the point Heidegger makes, in my opinion. And I think that's the best way to read his essay
547120	555200	on technology. Yeah, saying all that, Yun, right? I said a lot there, but the flow's yours.
556560	561840	Yeah. Well, you know, I agree. And I have the same kind of orientation or like
563920	569920	views on technology. And so I think what I can do is kind of build on what you've said.
572560	576240	But first of all, yeah, like Heidegger's take on technology, I think is a really,
576240	582080	really important one, right? Like, I think he sees very deeply, you could call him a prophet
582080	587200	in his sense, because he wrote the book in like 1950. Was it 1950, 1900, something like that?
587200	592320	The essay? No, 1950. I don't know when the essay was published. In fact, you keep going. I'll find
592320	596240	out when it was published. Yeah, it was early enough. But he saw through these things that,
597120	603360	that like he basically saw through how much of an impact to use a simple word, you know, like
603680	609760	exactly, exactly 1950. He hit the nail on the head. Yeah, that's, that's great. But he, he saw all
609760	614240	of this before any of it happened, right? Like in 1950, the world doesn't look like how it did
614240	619520	today, but he saw all of this coming. But I think one of the main points again, I want to
619520	626800	reiterate is like, an interesting thing here, I think is, I think, Raul, you made a few
628240	633040	points around like tech bros and like techno optimism. I think in this context on what,
633280	636560	what everything Heidegger is writing about, you can kind of extrapolate that to kind of
637840	641920	the whole generation, at least the whole new generation, because they're all brought up within
641920	647360	this setting, right? Like technology is inherently a part of the new generation. So in a way like
647360	652160	tech bros have this kind of techno optimism view. But I think it's inherent in everyone who
652160	657840	grows up, everyone who grew up in this kind of way of being, right? Which is times our religion.
658640	664800	Yeah. So I think the important point to make is that it's one of those things now technology is
664800	672240	one of those things now where it's, it's so deeply, it's so deeply encapsulated our ways of thinking.
672880	677520	And I think here it's probably more accurate to say the Western way of thinking that you don't
677520	685520	even notice it. Like no, like people on the street wouldn't be conscious, nearly conscious of like
685520	689840	what sort of effect technology is happening to them. And I think that's kind of the real baseline
689840	697840	idea we kind of trying to, trying to like expound on as well, right? Because as you mentioned,
697840	703600	and like from Heidegger, it's technology is not morally neutral, right? And this is what most people
703600	709600	think. It's not just tech bros, it's kind of most Gen Zs, even most parents, I'd say, although they
709600	714000	have more like more of a conscious idea of like what life was like before technology. I think most
714000	719920	people will, I think it's most, it's rather acceptable for lots of people nowadays to say
719920	726560	technology is neutral and it's just a means to an end. But as you mentioned, like that's kind of
726560	730320	missing like a lot of the point, right? Technology has a fundamental essence to it. There's a
730320	737280	fundamental, fundamental metaphysics to technology. And when you pause it, when you think technology
737280	744880	is just a means to kind of missing the deeper picture. And like, as you mentioned, one of the
744880	751600	ways in which, in which it's affecting us, like the essence is in terms of how we view people,
751600	756320	right? Like we view people as resources, we view nature as resources. And in a sense, it's kind
756320	761760	of like the critique of technology is somewhat similar to a critique of capitalism, right?
761760	766560	As more people might be familiar with. And I think that's fine, because like, if you think about it,
766560	772800	I think like capitalism thrives on technology, right? Like, in a capitalist society, what are
772800	780560	you looking for? Like, efficiency of production, something like that, right? Like, if you want to
780560	785920	excel as a company, as a producer, as a whatever, like what you're trying to do, you're trying to
785920	792880	produce more, more efficiently. And basically, technology, technological innovation is kind
792880	796960	of what drives it. And so I think you can't really divorce technology, a critique of technology and
796960	800160	a critique of capitalism. So you can kind of treat everything we're discussing as kind of
800160	806560	interchangeable in this respect. But that's it, right? It's this very deep and trench thing that
806560	811760	we're trying to kind of expound on. And like, we're trying to discuss the revelation that it's had
811760	821440	that everyone like kind of sees past nowadays. And I suppose the biggest, the biggest
823600	828160	threat or the biggest, the biggest kind of effect I see these days is
830640	833520	from my point of view, and then we can kind of launch into kind of a couple of different
833520	838800	points, because there's a lot out here as well. The biggest point of view, I think, is that people
838880	845440	are, there is like the fundamental metaphysical idea behind technology is also a form of
846640	851280	self-worship. It's a form of, it's a form of like,
853840	858160	from a Nietzschean point of view, like the Nietzschean idea is like a revaluation of values,
858800	867760	right? And so what technology is, is basically an attempt to create like a new order. It's an attempt
867760	873600	to create a new order in which, you know, human nature or man is mechanized in different ways,
873600	877280	let's say, like you can impose a rational order on the way we do things and make it more efficient.
878960	886640	And I think you could then kind of interpret like the whole movement of technology
886640	891600	being techno-optimism, kind of somewhat similar to scientism, right? It's this idea that, you know,
892320	896480	we are our own gods and we can decide whatever the world should look like, we can do whatever we want.
897360	905360	And our goal here is to kind of overcome nature, but then in doing so, like there are a couple of,
905360	909840	there are lots of risks, right? Like we kind of overcome nature, then we overcome ourselves,
909840	915280	we overcome ourselves, right? Like, and that's the point you raise with human resources as well,
915280	922400	right? Because once you see nature as something to be overcome or something to be used as a
922400	927760	resource, what's stopping you from seeing a human, right? As something to be like something to use
927760	932560	as a resource and something to like kind of have power over, it's all, it kind of all exists within
932560	942640	the same framework. And so I think the two things that kind of comes to mind firstly is
943280	948400	where this is all taking us, because there is a kind of development, there's a development to
948480	955440	technology, right? Like it doesn't just end with us having, being in a utopia, it's never that simple,
955440	961600	right? And here if I want to bring it down to kind of the ground level of practical, on a more
961600	969520	practical level, right? I think there's a lot of simple kind of simple ways, like you don't even
969520	972960	have to talk about philosophy. There's lots of simple ways now where people are beginning to
972960	980560	detect like certain faults or effects in which technology is putting us all at risk, right?
981280	987600	And a simple example is like Jonathan Hyde, he's a sociologist. He talks a lot about the risk of
987600	992960	social media and what it's doing to humanity. It's not morally neutral in that sense. And if we're
992960	997600	going to go down the road, the route of social media, it's not a morally neutral route where it's
998320	1004960	a pure means in which we are just doing whatever, like we're just using technology for our own sake,
1004960	1011120	right? Like it's doing something to us as well. And I like what CS Lewis said, I think it was in
1011120	1017120	the abolishment of man. Let me try and find a quote. He said this, each new power won by man
1017120	1023120	is a power over man as well. In every victory, besides being the general who triumphs, he is
1023120	1029840	also the prisoner who follows the triumphal cup. Beautiful quote. And so you're being, you're kind of
1031600	1038000	the more you kind of overpower nature, you overpower kind of everything, right? You're not,
1038000	1041440	you're also being taken along for the right. You're in a way a prisoner of what's being done.
1041440	1045120	Yeah, yeah. Actually, can we revisit that quote because that was a really good quote. I think,
1045840	1049920	you know, CS Lewis and I, for me, he's a bit too conservative, but I think he's a brilliant thinker.
1050160	1055920	Isn't it really interesting that you brought up Jonathan Hyde and social media and then you
1055920	1064240	quoted CS Lewis because social media perhaps is the quintessential example to exemplify that quote.
1064240	1068480	It shows the inherent contradiction in social media because think about social media.
1068480	1074000	Its promise was we're going to be global citizens. We're all going to be connected. We're all going
1074080	1080720	to be knowing what's going on. And it's just this beautiful utopian liberal dream, isn't it?
1080720	1087040	But then CS Lewis would be laughing at that and saying, oh, look, now we've become slaves and then
1087040	1094720	slave to social media. And this thing that was supposed to liberate us ended up enslaving us.
1094720	1099840	And I think that's where he points out that, I don't know, I know he's coming from a very kind
1100160	1107280	of Christian perspective and that's completely fine. So am I in many ways, but I think what's
1107280	1111920	more perspicacious is that him pointing out the contradiction in what social media is.
1111920	1117680	It's what it promised and what it became. No, 100%. And yeah, that's where that's what I was going to.
1117680	1124240	So like to finish my point, it's where we're at now. Technology has done something to us. It's not
1124240	1130240	morally neutral by any means. And one of the ways that this is reviewed is there are lots of
1130240	1136080	simple practical ways in which people are becoming more conscious. But also, I think it's quite clear
1136080	1143120	that going more and more further and more deeply down this path, it's not a utopia we're kind of
1143120	1149120	ending up with. It's something weird. And there are lots of words that people use that are quite
1149120	1156160	interesting. I like the word, I think Paul King's north as well. He used this word, like we're all
1156160	1163440	kind of entering into a hyper reality. Yeah. Oh, John Baudrillard hyper reality. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1163440	1166880	Like I really like that word, right? We're not, it's not like when you talk about utopia, that's
1166880	1172400	kind of the thing that techno optimists look at, right? They romanticize the idea of technology,
1172400	1178400	really they romanticize the idea of innovation and like overcoming nature and overcoming like
1178400	1182640	human nature even, right? Like when I see human nature, I mean, like the limitations, supposedly.
1182640	1186400	But what that doesn't include is this whole, you know,
1190000	1196880	what's the way to put it? Yeah. Yeah. I'm getting inklings of what I was going to mention. Oh,
1196880	1202560	it's so weird to like juggle many thoughts. If I'll just finish it, wherever I'm going to take
1202560	1208640	it now, right? But it's like, basically, the fault of techno optimism is this whole idea of you,
1208640	1215520	you romanticizing the whole idea of changing the way people do things without seeing,
1215520	1220800	and this was in the CS Lewis quote, right, that you become a prisoner of what is, what becomes
1220800	1229760	as well. It's like, it kind of goes both ways. And I also had a couple more. So I think, so
1229760	1237280	social media is a pretty common way in which the common person can easily detect like thoughts,
1237280	1242160	right? Where in where this is all taking us, it's not a perfect thing by any means. And it might be
1242160	1247520	even like immoral in many senses, right? And that's the, that's, I think, like a lot of
1247520	1252240	heights research around social media is like social media is affecting us badly in many ways,
1252240	1259120	which we never expected. Yeah, it's already a pretty simple. That's a good example, I think.
1259120	1264000	And also this morning, I read a newsletter by a tech person, so a technologist,
1264640	1270080	and I saw a few interesting like things on here, which is also like what people can easily perceive
1271360	1276800	like to be dangerous or risks, right? And firstly, this relates to what Heidegger mentioned,
1276800	1280480	but what she wrote here, and there's much more simple language as opposed to what Heidegger
1280480	1285360	would have written, but part of the problem with the lean startup mindset, lean startup
1285360	1290240	meaning basically kind of the methodology around startups and tech, right? Is that it sees live
1290240	1294720	and work as an optimization problem. The point is to help people live a good life, not just an
1294720	1299600	efficient life. The goal is human flourishing, not convenience. The goal is a good future, not a
1299600	1305920	technically advanced future. And so it's pretty like technologists and kind of everyday people
1305920	1310720	are perceiving this. And this was written by, sorry, I think I'm not sure you pronounce her name,
1310720	1316560	but she's a technologist. And I'll put up her. Is it a substack or what is it? Yeah, yeah,
1316560	1320960	substack. Put up the substack. Yeah. And the second thing she wrote, also kind of in more
1320960	1326080	simple words, it's like, I've lost a lot of faith in tech solutionism, the idea that most
1326080	1330400	problems can be solved by technology. Why? Because most problems are people problems,
1330400	1334960	not technology problems. I don't believe. Very important point. We need to touch on that. That's
1334960	1338800	a very important point. Yeah, I don't believe we are about to surrender to a robotic new dawn,
1338800	1343440	where an AI will replace McKinsey or your therapist. Why? Because a company doesn't hire
1343440	1348080	McKinsey because they're better than the AI. They hire McKinsey because if something goes wrong,
1348080	1354080	nobody will blame you for hiring McKinsey. Humans are complicated. And so on this level,
1354080	1359040	you can kind of see as well, like lots of kind of tech solutionism, that's an interesting word,
1359040	1366560	is this is the point that kind of that most problems are people problems. And even on this
1366560	1377040	level, right, kind of the applied technological level, there are already gaps. You could say
1377040	1382240	problems, right? For me, the word I've been using recently, thanks to Tom McGavin,
1382240	1388160	is contradictions. Human existence is, ontologically, there's like this,
1388800	1395520	we have built in contradictions that we can't get away with or jettison out of our existence.
1396640	1400320	Okay, I took down a lot of notes here, we know what you were saying. I want to get back
1400320	1404320	to the self-worship point, because that is something that I hadn't thought about much.
1404320	1409600	And because pretty much everything you said, I've kind of thought about written on and obviously
1409600	1415280	I resonate with. But the self-worship bit isn't something I have, I have, I have thought about.
1415280	1420160	And the reason I want to talk about that is I realized in my initial long monologue, I kind of
1420160	1425680	missed a certain point I was going to make, which was that technology is not neutral as we
1425680	1436560	discussed, but also another misconception tech bros have is they think that all technology will do
1436560	1442640	is that it'll just amplify who we already are. And that comes with a lot of assumptions and
1442640	1447600	ideological presuppositions that we already know who we are, that yes, human beings are static and
1447600	1453120	that we have a specific nature of some kind. And secondly, that technology will just make
1453120	1461200	kind of better versions of what human beings are. Whereas I would say if a lot of, well,
1461200	1469600	I would certainly religion, but also philosophy, 20th century philosophy history, and now more
1469600	1478080	recent sociological and psychological research is showing us that no human beings are malleable,
1478080	1484800	not in a bad sense, nor in a good sense. We are malleable as such. And therefore, it's a mistake
1484800	1491680	to assume that the human subject, even at an individual level, can, can just, we can amplify
1491680	1498400	who we are. That, that, that doesn't happen. Our social environment deeply affects us. But,
1498400	1504000	but saying all that though, is it because I don't get it, because for me, my whole,
1504000	1508960	my whole view with technology is we're moving towards a, thanks to capitalism. And I mean
1508960	1514080	that obviously, sadonically, a post humanist society where human beings simply become agents
1514080	1519440	of capital, they become technical agents in society. But when you talk about self worship,
1519440	1524160	that kind of gives it a bit of a different thrust. So perhaps you could expand on that a bit.
1524160	1527280	Yeah, yeah. But yes, also, so what you're mentioning around
1527680	1534080	the technology having kind of its own essence, right, that whole thing. I
1536720	1542880	think, and so most people now they see it as neutral, but that misses the point. It's like,
1542880	1547920	when, because I think when you say all technology is self augmenting, you kind of assume that it's
1547920	1553440	neutral, right, like it just augments. But no, it has its own essence, it has its own metaphysics,
1553520	1556560	as we were discussing, right? Yes, its own reality in some sense, which
1558400	1561680	yeah, it's a hyper reality as well, as you mentioned. And I think the last thing I read
1561680	1565840	is from Jack, Jack's, I'm not sure you pronounce his name, but he he's also written quite a bit
1565840	1576240	of on technology. And he recognized it as a self augmenting force, but one that kind of
1576240	1581600	engineers the world on its own terms. And so I guess that's the way that's how that's how
1581680	1586400	Heidegger ends his essay in fact. Heidegger makes the point towards the end of his essay,
1587120	1592320	that technology has a being of its own, that that does change and augment the world. Yes.
1592320	1596000	Yeah, because it is self augmenting in its application, right? And so in that sense,
1596000	1600320	it's like it's neutral because it just augments the human subject. But no, it kind of does it
1600320	1604320	on its own terms because then you create something, you create a being, almost a mode of being,
1604320	1608000	right? And that has its own essence, its own metaphysics, that's what we've been repeating.
1608000	1612720	And I want to give an example on that. I think kissing point would be the stock market.
1612720	1618000	Majority of the stock market, it's not human beings, the actors in the stock market aren't
1618000	1623600	human beings anymore. It's virtually robots. It's program machine softwares that are doing
1624160	1630720	stock trading and whatnot. And yes, you could argue that the capitalist by by workers and by
1630720	1638320	human beings. But regardless, the stock market now is a system with with its own metaphysics,
1638320	1646560	with its own reality. And human beings are becoming unnecessary for it. We're becoming
1648560	1653440	so before before we get into the self worship bit, I think it's important to kind of get into
1654480	1658080	what we mean really when we think about the essence of metaphysics
1659040	1662560	of technology, right? Because I think we've said this many times, but it's not I think it's not
1662560	1667040	we can make it clearer like what that actually means. And so kind of self worship, if I was to
1667040	1672160	talk about the art, I would kind of think about it more to like towards the end, like self worship
1672160	1676720	is kind of where we're leading ourselves ourselves to. But even right now, what we're participating
1676720	1685360	is in like this whole met like this whole hyper reality that we live in is it's got a it's got
1685440	1690880	its own metaphysics, it's got its own essence. And what that means, right? I think the example
1690880	1698480	we mentioned earlier was that we start to see people as resources. That's kind of one way to
1698480	1703120	look at it. Well, okay, to really, really break this down, because I know that you and I tend to
1703120	1710320	get very abstract without thinking is metaphysics in a very pragmatic way of putting it is it's
1710400	1717200	simply telling us an art. That means what are we supposed to do? Now, of course, if you go to
1717200	1722160	Aristotelian metaphysics, you could you could look for the metaphysics or the essence of a tree.
1722160	1726720	What's a tree? Is there a platonic tree somewhere? Well, let's let's forget about all of that for a
1726720	1732960	moment. Let's just simply think at a at a social level, metaphysics is an art. So what are we
1732960	1739200	supposed to do with a without given reality? And connecting that in my view, connecting that to
1739200	1747040	human resources would be okay, the metaphysical sort of injunction or what they're told to do
1747040	1756640	is to take these human agents and use them to, I don't know, maximize profit or maximize
1756640	1763120	productivity, optimize or be more efficient. So that is kind of the metaphysical injunction or
1763840	1768880	ideological injunction that is metaphysical after all. And that's the kind of the way I view
1769760	1773680	the the metaphysics of technology, although, although, and I want to kind of put this caveat
1773680	1778640	here. So because we started off with Heidegger, look, this port isn't on Heidegger, but we started
1778640	1782240	off with Heidegger. So it doesn't have to be about Heidegger, but for Heidegger, it's not just
1782240	1787920	that it's also he's looking for an essence of technology and what that entails. But sorry,
1787920	1790960	did my kind of point about the, you know, that's good. That's good. So it's kind of
1792320	1795840	and I think there's one more layer to it as well. Like, I think, you know, we see each other's,
1795840	1799920	we see each other as as capital resources, essentially, and that's a danger to her, obviously,
1799920	1806560	right? But I think there's one, like, another layer of art as well is I think
1807920	1813360	we kind of blend on this idea, like this intrinsic idea that we don't talk about that.
1814800	1822400	If we, if we liberate ourselves from everything, we would be happier. It's that kind of,
1823280	1826960	like it's just the classic capitalist kind of ideology, right? And that's something very
1826960	1833360	inherent in technology, right? It's like the thing that causes us unhappiness is like systems
1833360	1839600	or structures that we have to be liberated from. And that's, that's sometimes true. But I think now
1839600	1844800	we're getting to the point where we, we're trying to liberate ourselves from reality itself.
1846080	1850960	Right. And so, but then the thing is that in a far more fundamental way, it's just making
1850960	1856960	far more people more unhappy, which is, which is, which is a contradiction, almost ironic
1856960	1861760	contradiction you pointed out before. And you know, you would, you, you in fact hit the nail on
1861760	1867520	the head because this guy Ray Kurzweil, who is kind of like a futurist, he, I remember reading,
1867520	1871920	I haven't read any of his books, but he is kind of known as well. He, he perhaps is like before
1871920	1878640	Balaji and Elon Musk and all these types. He was kind of the OG tech bro. And he was writing about
1878640	1885600	these things, you know, in like the nineties. And he has this really interesting essay, which I read,
1885600	1894160	I forget where, but he talks about how you could just live in a simulation and you won't be limited
1894160	1899280	by your physical reality. So you could live kind of the mind in a back machine. So if you, one day,
1899280	1904640	if you feel like a woman, you are a woman. And not to go to the whole gender, you know,
1904720	1907440	debate about that, like forget about it. But no, I think it's true.
1907440	1913600	Like if you feel like, look, let's say a biological female, right? You just all you got to do is
1914480	1921040	kind of cognize that in your, in your, in your brain. And then you become that thing. So
1921760	1928400	we kind of completely let go of our physical embodied reality, which for Heidegger, Maurice
1928400	1935760	Molleponti or modern Cogsci, a cognitive science would be an, and complete abomination,
1935760	1938560	given that we are deeply embodied creatures to be human.
1938560	1945840	Yeah. Well, at the end of the day, we try and liberate ourselves from reality. So precisely,
1945840	1954800	that's what we're doing. Yes. Because also that Heidegger is kind of metaphysics, right? It's
1954880	1960480	not just about you, but it's about, it's not just about subject and object. That's kind of
1960480	1964000	his metaphysics. He breaks it. Yeah. No differentiation there. It's kind of the
1964000	1968880	subject participating, subject and object are one. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, he has got many,
1968880	1974160	like he calls it that's man, he calls it life. Well, the idea being that you can't just, yeah,
1974160	1979920	you can't isolate the subject from their life world as such. Yeah. Yeah. So to put it simply,
1980160	1986000	it's like kind of man has a certain relation to nature, right? Man has a certain relation to
1986000	1991440	others, like the other, right? And there's a certain kind of,
1994160	1997920	without going into what that should look like, I think what technology does is it comes in
1997920	2003760	and imposes a certain view on that, right? Like, because traditionally, like pre-modernity,
2004400	2010880	like man so nature as something to be worked with. Correct. Like man so fellow man as like
2010880	2015920	something to be treasured as friends. In fact, the kind of what technology does,
2015920	2021680	what the whole technological worldview does, this is, again, talking of discussing its essence,
2022800	2029280	is firstly, kind of nature is seen as something to be used as a resource, right? Slash is to be
2030240	2036320	overpowered, right? And overpowered means used, right? It's kind of the same thing. And the danger
2036320	2040160	is that the same thing is applied to man, right? Like man becomes human resources, as you say,
2040160	2044960	it's something to be used. And so in that sense, you can kind of see how technology is not neutral,
2044960	2049600	it imposes a worldview, that's the essence. I mean, also, on your point on pre-modernity,
2049600	2055040	the Hegelian point there would be in pre-modern society, and obviously I'm not a historian,
2055120	2062560	but from what I've read, it's not even that we, that individuals, so other individuals as,
2063200	2069680	as, oh, that's someone that I'm related to. No, no, no, they saw their subjectivity in them. As in,
2070400	2074640	I am you as much as you are me. Yeah. Oh, no, no. Oh, yeah. No, but I'll give you the
2074640	2079120	technological spin, right? It's not like, because nowadays, what's the phenomenon we call the social
2079120	2083280	phenomenon? Everything is kind of networking, right? Yes. Oh my god, dude, you read my mind again.
2084240	2088480	But like, when you speak to other people, you are like, what's the career gain here?
2088480	2094560	Correct. I hate the term networking. It's a total term. It's just even something as
2094560	2098640	intimate as friendship becomes something where I need to get something from that person
2098640	2105360	for me to rise in the social hierarchy or whatnot. Exactly. So that's the imposition of
2105360	2110800	technology, right? Sorry, sorry, sorry. I interrupt you. Can you say that, make that point again,
2110800	2114080	a bit more, like fresher out a bit more, because I feel like you were getting out,
2114080	2120720	making a really good point and I got excited. So again, clearly, so people get what you're
2120720	2124720	saying is really, really, it happens between us. But yeah, so technology has an essence, right?
2124720	2128880	And two clear examples where I can see it playing out. And I think which Heidegger touched on in
2128880	2137680	book as well is like nature and fellow men, right? So you, we used to see nature as something to
2137760	2143040	work with. We used to see men and women as friends, right? Friendships would be cultivated.
2143760	2147840	We kind of saw everything on equal ground. But then when the capitalistic slash technological
2148800	2155840	ideals, ideas started playing in the picture, then we, that started twisting our worldview, right?
2155840	2162400	It started twisting our relation to the things around us. And as Heidegger's metaphysics goes,
2162400	2169440	and which I actually, I personally agree with, like man is not just an individual, right? That
2169440	2174960	uses things. No, like it's not just a subject and a relation to the object, like being separate in
2174960	2179200	any way, right? In the subject very much participates in the object in a very,
2180880	2188240	like you can't, you can't separate them in a very inseparable way. And so when technology comes in
2188240	2195600	and twists certain views, you know, it's, it affects the human, it affects the mind to an
2195600	2200480	understated degree. And that's why I think these days, right? It's something that's so heavily
2200480	2204560	encapsulates everyone's thinking that they kind of not, you're not even conscious of it.
2205600	2209200	I mean, it changes you. It makes you something human.
2210000	2215840	Yeah. Yes. Like nowadays, like meeting someone purely for career gains normal,
2215920	2221440	whereas it wasn't 50 years ago. And that's what technology does to us. And like using nature
2222320	2228240	is normal to us, right? Yeah. I mean, we can't use it. We can't exploit. We can't exploit. We
2228240	2234000	commoditize nature. But if you tell that to like an indigenous, you know, someone in, in this,
2234000	2238400	I don't know, 1400s, 1300s, that would sound absolutely. Even our own Aboriginal people in
2238400	2242160	Australia, like, I mean, I'm sure, obviously, don't get me wrong. I'm not making, I hate to
2242160	2246720	make the racist argument or their primitive native one with nature. None of that nonsense.
2246720	2253840	But if you, if you speak to, let's say, it doesn't have to be, leave aside the Aboriginal people,
2253840	2260640	because I hate that argument, you know, noble savage, it's very racist. But if you study, if you
2260640	2267840	do like, listen, anthropological study, anthropological study and explore these communities,
2268400	2275520	certainly they don't have this concept of exploiting nature or using seeing nature as a resource.
2275520	2283840	For them, nature was very much alive. And it was, it was a part of them as much as they were part of
2284720	2289920	it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, precisely. And that's, and that's one of the things, right? Because now the
2289920	2296080	danger, I think, is the kind of metaphysical problem. Like it's a, it's a kind of a spiritual crisis,
2296080	2302480	right? As you will call it. That is, we're losing our relation to everything around us, right?
2302480	2306320	We start to see nature as something to be used. We start to see humans as something to be used.
2307280	2310880	And there's something that you lose there. There's something that you lose there. And I think
2310880	2314880	that's where kind of my whole idea around self worship comes in, because that's a position of
2314880	2321520	pride, right? That's to say that, you know, kind of my imperative here is to have power over
2321840	2327040	everything. It's to kind of reinvent, like impose a new order and everything.
2327040	2329600	It becomes a Hobbesian nightmare, you know, it's just.
2329600	2333440	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think like, and that's probably the Christian worldview in me
2333440	2338320	speaking as opposed to the Nietzschean, because the Nietzschean ideals will be like, no, let's reinvent
2338320	2342880	the way things are done. But I don't think that's possible in many ways. And that's why I kind of
2342880	2350320	refer to C.S. Lewis, because like in the abolishment of man, abolishment of, abolishment of man.
2351280	2356640	My favorite Lewis book by myself, right? He basically writes precisely about this subject,
2356640	2361360	right? Which is like the Nietzschean ideal kind of falls on its own head, because you can't
2362480	2369520	revalue values using the values, using the values themselves, right? And so there's,
2369520	2373360	there's a lot to be. I have a slight disagreement there, but we don't have to get to that. I have
2373360	2379520	a slight philosophical debate there. We can do it another time. But the whole danger there is one
2379520	2384560	of pride, right? And I think putting aside the Nietzschean idea, which I think there's some problems
2384560	2389440	there. I think if you look at it from a Christian point of view, it's like pride goes before a fall
2389440	2397600	to put it more simply. And also to cover a bit of what Lewis prophesied in the abortion of
2397600	2406080	ban book is if we keep on trying to go down this path of like gaining power over everything,
2406080	2413120	we gain power over nature, we can use, we can extract everything as resources, we start doing
2413120	2418640	the same to other people. And eventually we start doing the thing to human nature itself, right?
2418640	2427200	And there's the whole kind of thing around the whole he prophesies this endpoint to be kind of
2427200	2435360	the eugenic event, right? The event at which basically man takes on the position of God as a
2435360	2440640	creator. Yeah, yeah. And you know, connecting that to a bit of what Heidegger is talking about here,
2440640	2446000	that's sort of what he means by enframing. And the grand irony of all of that was Heidegger was a
2446000	2451920	big old Nazi. And the Jews were exactly, they were enframed, they were just used things to be
2453040	2461680	powered to exploit and used upon. And certainly, you know, even the Nazi ideal has an element of
2461760	2468080	self-worship. But for them, it's more that they worship a system, they worship the organic unity
2468080	2475840	or the whole of being, which for me is a fascistic idea. So as you were, as you were
2475840	2482640	expounding on the self-worship, but I was trying to figure out, how can I juxtapose this with kind
2482640	2488240	of my thesis, which is the post-humanist idea that we are becoming, we're becoming something that is
2489200	2494800	not human. The future of humanity is going to be without human beings, so to speak.
2496880	2502320	I'm going to try to make a point here, but you were going to say something. You go first?
2502320	2508000	Yeah, yeah. I think that's the hyper-reality element to it. Yeah, yeah. So I don't think
2508000	2512640	Louis saw it from that lens, right? So says Louis specifically saw it from the lens of eugenics. And
2512720	2518800	I think there's something to that point as well, which is the final stage of man's conquest over
2518800	2528000	nature is basically when, you know, in the course of reality, when someone, like when one age,
2528560	2534480	one age really attains, you know, by eugenics, the power to make its descendants as whatever it
2534480	2539360	pleases. Yeah. I mean, for me now, I would still say that's post-humanist, because the post-humanist
2539360	2545360	idea is that there's no, there's no human being per se. We're just, again, we're biological entities
2545360	2551680	and we can be optimized, we're used. And so, and so what Louis points out is that in a way,
2551680	2559680	all men who live after this age are patients of that power. So then they are weaker, not stronger.
2559680	2563200	Yeah. So like, no matter what kind of power. That's a supreme irony. Yeah.
2563200	2567840	The things we put in their hands, it's this people in this age which has preordained how
2567840	2572400	they are to use them. So in a very interesting way, Louis prophesied this endpoint, this event
2572400	2578960	at which we are bringing ourselves to this route, which is we, our conquest becomes over human nature
2578960	2585120	itself. And I think a very vivid image of this is in Huxley's Brave New World, right? This human
2585120	2590480	nature is the last part of nature to surrender to men, right? And in Brave New World, in Huxley's
2590480	2594880	Brave New World, there's eugenics, there's like prenatal conditioning, I believe, right? Yeah.
2595520	2600320	And of course, happiness drop, yeah. Perfected the human species, right?
2601280	2605360	And there's like a perfect, I don't know, applied psychology, whatever, and man has
2605360	2609600	perfect control over it. Behaviorism, BF skin and behaviorism, man, it's a monastic, yeah.
2609600	2613120	Yeah. Yeah. And basically, Louis points out that that's the point at which
2614240	2617200	man reaches the pinnacle of the power and everyone else is kind of,
2618880	2624400	you know, a prisoner of that. Yeah. So that's something I find interesting. But the artificial
2624400	2629920	piece, artificial intelligence is something else. It might be something else or it might not be.
2629920	2633520	I'm also wondering how we can kind of dive into this. Well, in fact, when I was going to bring
2633520	2639280	this up to you at the end of the part, but I think we, this whole conversation, we can end on a
2639280	2643920	positive note. And I'll tell you why. And as you know, I'm very cynical. I don't really end things
2643920	2652320	on positive notes generally. But this, this topic of technology, there is in the typical
2652320	2658240	Hegelian move in the failure, there can, there can be something good that comes out of it, I believe.
2660560	2665920	So firstly, the reason, you know, I was a bit initially a bit confused about the
2665920	2670960	self-worship point was the way I, the way I view the kind of post-humanist idea is that
2672080	2680560	human subjects, they, they, they stop viewing themselves as human beings. Whatever this deep
2680640	2685440	down identity we have as human beings, it's just, it's jenisin. But then I realized, in fact,
2685440	2690800	no, the self-worship point is perhaps more perspicacious because in post-modern society,
2690800	2697920	we live in this kind of ruthless pragmatism. So being a self-worshipping, egoistic,
2697920	2704400	narcissist is one of the best ways to get around post-modern capitalist society if you are a bit
2704400	2710400	Machiavellian, because then, you know, as we were discussing, if we view other human beings as not
2710400	2717600	really human, but rather some other biological agents to be used and exploited, then pretty much
2717600	2723680	the best way is to play the game, play the game and get to the top, whatever the top and, and the,
2723680	2727680	and the funny thing is in post-modernism, the top doesn't even matter, it's just climb the hierarchy
2727760	2733920	for the sake of climbing the hierarchy. There, there's no, there's no, there aren't the, let's say
2733920	2740160	the, the, the, the typical values of, of beauty, love, truth or God, none of that. It's just climb
2740160	2744960	the hierarchy. We discussed this in the previous pods, isn't it? So, and then in that self-worship
2744960	2750880	kind of works because it's not self-worship in the sense that you think, I don't know, at least
2750880	2755280	this is my interpretation of it, but there's something special about me that I'm unique,
2755280	2761280	I'm divine and none of that, it's just, I am, I am who I am. It doesn't even matter, but what matters
2761280	2767440	is the, is the game, is the, is the task, it's the, it's the, it's partaking in, in, in the, in the
2767440	2777920	social game, so to speak. Um, yeah, yeah. Well, I think there are two ways to look at it, right? And
2777920	2781600	earlier, as I mentioned, like there's kind of a Nietzsche approach, which is to lean into it,
2782240	2786960	because if you are going to think about, like, because Nietzsche's idea is like,
2786960	2791040	the Ubermanches, like the Superman, that's the ideal you want to, you want to be, right? You
2791040	2798800	want to be the person to kind of revalue valuations, right? Yeah. Rebuild and kind of, I mean, you want
2798800	2803920	to even, you want to rebuild the, the meta values itself, not just values, but reevaluate what values
2804000	2813520	are itself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so kind of, as we discussed, technology is a major imposition
2813520	2819040	on like the way things are done and how like worldviews, like, like to do the modern worldviews,
2819040	2823760	right? If you were to work and build within that space, you kind of have the opportunity to do
2823760	2830160	something like that, right? Well, I mean, actually, I was like, sorry, like, I guess the
2830640	2838560	easiest way to say how much of an impact technology is, is if we were to boil down the ages
2839600	2847360	into one word, like you wouldn't call this current age we're in and, you know, a post-modern age,
2847360	2851680	like that does some, that's mean something. If you call it an atheistic age, like, yeah,
2851680	2855280	that's something, I think people usually call you a technological age. Correct. Because I mean,
2855280	2859760	post-modern age, you could even call it the last century, but our specific age is perhaps
2859760	2865280	the technological age. So I think you can conclude from that. Say to say, technology has been like
2865280	2870640	the genre, like the era defining thing, right? And so if you were to pursue the Nietzsche ideal,
2870640	2874720	you have the opportunity to redefine the way everything starts, right, in that lens. I think,
2875280	2881040	although on the Christian kind of religious path, I think there's a, there's quite something to the
2881040	2887520	whole idea of, I think I saw this coin somewhere, but it's like technological acesis, I think, like,
2888320	2893760	like acicism, like being a technological aesthetic, right? Basically, distancing yourself from
2893760	2901520	technology and its metaphysics. And the whole imperative there is like, be aware that, you know,
2901520	2906080	technology in everything, there is a trade-off, right? Like, no technology is perfect,
2906080	2912400	everything comes at a price, and prices that we're not aware of. And more importantly,
2912400	2917120	that you can't have your cake and eat it too. Exactly. Because the trade-off argument for
2917120	2920400	me, that's too pragmatic. Because that kind of makes the assumption that, oh, you can have the
2920400	2924400	good without the bad. I don't think that's how the reality works. I agree. But I think, firstly,
2924400	2929760	you'll become aware of it, right? You'll be aware of it. Certainly. The whole imperative there from
2929760	2933680	the Christian point of view is to kind of keep the means, the means, and keep the ends, the ends,
2933680	2940400	right? Yes. I actually made a note earlier, but I think Ivan Illich, I think that's his name,
2940400	2945200	he's also written quite a bit on technology. You may have to send me all these things because
2945280	2950880	I need to put them in the show. But he argues for what he calls a convivial use of technology.
2950880	2954480	Sorry, what was that word? Convivial. Right. I don't actually don't know what it means.
2956320	2962000	That's what he called it. But what that entails basically is firstly, technology
2962800	2968880	exists to fulfill man's existing needs and desires, instead of generating new needs and desires.
2969600	2975920	And so, technology, capitalism, you can kind of, that's when you place the means as means and
2975920	2980160	ends as ends, I think. The other point is quite simple. Increases man's freedom,
2980160	2986400	independence, enhances welfare, physical man. Okay, okay. Now here's where my cynical side is
2986400	2993040	coming out. As a Zhezhekian lecanian, I don't know if that's possible. This is the way I become
2993040	3000720	very cynical. I don't know if it's possible for us to purely use technology as something that,
3001440	3007840	as a tool, which is how most of us think it was used. As a pure tool that fulfills our desires.
3007840	3013200	Because firstly, I don't think human desire can ever be fulfilled. We are desiring beings. And
3013200	3020720	for me here, lecan is, he is a prophet, he gets it, he gets it precisely. Which again,
3020720	3027600	is the problem. Which the problem is that our desires are unfulfillable. Therefore, the technological
3027600	3033360	metaphysics or whatever you may call it, can exploit those desires. And for me though, for me
3033360	3040320	though, I don't know, as far as I can say, my only way to approach this is to take on that
3040320	3048160	contradiction. It's not to, it's not to try and take the good without the bad. Because that,
3048240	3053200	as C.S. Loews points out, would make things worse, is to take on the contradiction. And of
3053200	3057360	course, that doesn't mean succumbing and giving into the bad. I'm not saying, oh, go and become a
3057360	3062960	porn addict in, I don't know, Mark Zuckerberg's meta word and just like that. I don't mean that.
3062960	3068960	I mean, as you said, first be aware of it. And then the only solution I see is through critique,
3068960	3076240	through perpetual critique, through working through the contradictions and doing all these
3076240	3080000	things which some people who are a bit more intellectual might find silly. Things like,
3080000	3085680	you know, social media detoxes, digital minimalism. Those are good things. We should not sneer at them
3085680	3090960	and kind of look down upon them. Because that's the, again, that's our life world. We can't,
3092160	3096880	don't play the Buddhist game or the quasi-Buddhist game where you, oh, everything's a cosmic
3096880	3102000	phenomenon. Detach us. No, no, no. For me, it's partaking the contradictions and work through them.
3102240	3104960	Which is hard, which is difficult work.
3104960	3108800	Right. You know, that's a good point. But also, yeah, I guess from a psycho and analytical
3108800	3112960	point of view, it's like desire is everything. Yeah. Desire is fundamental because we are
3112960	3120240	lacking beings. That's an interesting one. But I think very much there are kind of different
3120240	3126560	levels to it. And where my mind goes with that is like to go back to kind of the whole essence
3126560	3134080	of technology, right? I think one of the major, like one, I'd say even it's, it's driving force
3134880	3140560	is that within technology itself, it's essence. It's not just that you're engineering tools,
3140560	3147440	but you're engineering desires. Certainly. Because it reveals. It reveals. Yeah, you're kind of,
3147440	3152560	and it's, that's a very deliberate thing, right? And that's the whole, that's the whole concept of,
3152560	3161520	that's not concept. The whole driving force of capitalism and social engineering or propaganda,
3161520	3167760	right? I mean, I mean, social engineering, ideology, it's also kind of how like people
3167760	3171680	like Balaji, they talk about the network state where in the network state, we can create it,
3171680	3176400	where it's not top down planning, but it's bottom up planning. But nonetheless, there still is an
3176400	3181360	ideology that tells people what to do, which, which communities. But it's like, that's, like,
3181360	3188000	that's, that's technology. Oh, yeah, certainly. Yeah, he, I mean, he is like technology. It's
3188000	3192240	like that to me, that is technology. And you know something interesting as, as, I mean, I'm kind
3192240	3196480	of braver, you know, your, your, your line of thought that I'm sorry for like interrupting
3197360	3202080	or breaking a lot of thought. So Techne, here's where I really like Heidegger because he placed
3202560	3209920	his, he's brilliant. Like he's his knowledge on language is unbelievable. Techne in ancient Greek
3209920	3216320	was also used for art. So art was referred to as Techne and art is perhaps one of the,
3217040	3222560	you know, perhaps the typical example of something that reveals, right? Art reveals to it. It reveals
3222560	3227840	new realities, reveals truths. So what's really interesting is that word Techne that was used
3227840	3234720	for art historically, especially in ancient Greece, is now used for, for technical tools,
3234720	3240560	for technology. And I don't, I don't know what to make of it, but Heidegger thinks, oh, what,
3240560	3243760	he's like, okay, why is that? Just got a question why that is. That's really,
3243760	3248400	Yeah, no, that's just a really good point. But then, yeah, though it becomes clear, right? It's
3248400	3255040	like, kind of propaganda is, is not part of it. It's like propaganda is almost like,
3255840	3259520	breathing air. It's like the breathing air for technology itself, right? Yeah, it's not like
3259520	3265040	a byproduct. No, no, no, it is it. It is the ideology is it? Yeah. Yeah. There's, there's
3265040	3269920	obviously this very interesting layer as well, where to the whole worldview or essence of technology,
3269920	3274800	where it's like, engineer, the engineering of desires. And obviously that's kind of
3276080	3281840	its own, like we can run a whole separate discussion on. Well, yeah, I mean, one thing I
3281840	3285440	want to do, in fact, one thing I want to do is, because I know we're going to do some book
3285440	3290640	discussions in the future is to discuss, because I think, you know, this book here by Todd MacGowden,
3292080	3294960	capitalism and desire, you know, I've spoken about this a couple of times.
3296960	3301840	I mean, this, this book could easily be technology and desire and the message of the book would
3301840	3308960	still stand. If we could just, because they did the two things go hand in hand that tightly
3308960	3316320	related. Yeah, well, is there any insights from that book that relate to what? Well, I mean,
3316320	3322800	it's the idea of, the idea of desire is metanomic that it desire, desires for the sake of desiring.
3323440	3327520	And, and then the idea of object, we don't desire something that exists, it's a virtual
3327520	3332400	category. And then he connects that to our capitalism functions. But like, I haven't,
3332560	3338880	I need to like prepare properly if I'm gonna do like, I might do a pod that kind of it's on the book.
3340640	3344960	Yeah, well, because I guess like the, you know, the accompanying idea there is like,
3344960	3350880	it's ruling by desires, right? Like it's, it's to bring back the brave new world, right? Like,
3350880	3358880	because what that contrast is, in a few centuries ago, Orwell wrote 1984. And that was basically
3358880	3366400	the ruling of a nation, whatever you call it, the ruling of people via control and power, right?
3366400	3373360	Totalitarian top down, basically. But then Huxley, I think Huxley wrote Brave New World before,
3374320	3378160	Orwell actually wrote 1984. Oh, is that right? I think Huxley, I think Huxley was right.
3380880	3384880	Huxley was actually Orwell's lecturer, I think I got the order right. And the very
3384880	3388320	interesting thing is they had some correspondence between each other, where basically Huxley
3388320	3395440	disagreed with Orwell. So it was like great writing and whatnot. But he thinks that, you know,
3395440	3402960	at some point, the totalitarians of the 1984 idea will realize that it's a lot more efficient to
3402960	3412720	control people by means of desire alone, right? I mean, we live more in and Huxley in reality than
3412880	3417680	Orwellian. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's like, it's power by giving us what we want, basically.
3418960	3425520	Or by creating false needs. But giving us what we want, just enough. And that's the point
3425520	3430480	Tottenham government makes. Capitalism works in the contradiction of it works by not working.
3431120	3438720	It gives us just enough. Yeah, even like, I think probably like Stalin and Mao even would be impressed.
3439440	3445680	Yeah. So much control can be. Yeah, yeah. I mean, what's interesting is, you know,
3445680	3448960	Rijek talks about having a Soviet Union. They always
3449680	3455280	allowed people a certain level of freedom. They always gave people so you could make jokes
3455920	3461680	against the state against the party. There was a certain level of, you know, kind of
3461680	3468880	unsaid humor and that that allowed people to that that this that's exactly how control works.
3469440	3474480	It's not this kind of the way Orwell imagine. I think personally, Orwell is a bit overrated.
3474480	3481280	This kind of where it's just tight. You can't say anything. You can't can't utter a word. It's
3481280	3485840	complete censorship. No, no. It's like, it's kind of like teasing us with a bit of freedom.
3485840	3491200	We're kept in control, which is why I think we live more in a Huxley in reality than
3491600	3498000	or within reality. Hey, look, I don't know. Pretty much what I've kind of wanted to discuss,
3498000	3503280	I think I've made the points, although I did say that I have, I'm a bit optimistic about all of
3503280	3508720	this, right, regardless of my cynicism. So shall we shall we get there? Or are there any more points
3508720	3513280	you want to make? Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, we can talk about optimism, because I think
3513760	3523120	even though that's the kind of ruling the ideology, happiness ideology, technology is going to save
3523120	3528000	the world, you know, but what Dostoevsky wrote, beauty will save the world. I think the modern
3528000	3535520	consensus is something more like technology, which obviously for me, I side with beauty over
3535520	3541280	technology. But okay, my okay, I don't even know if this is optimistic. All I'm saying is this,
3541920	3548160	the way I view in the failure, there'll be something good that comes out of it is, in fact,
3548160	3554000	this is interestingly, the part I did with Dr. Grace Tapie, the Lacanian psychoanalyst,
3555040	3558960	she kind of put this thought in my head. But before that, I've also been thinking about this a bit.
3559760	3567680	I think given the fact that technology is doing what it's doing to us, it's kind of
3568640	3573680	taking us towards this hyper-reality or post-humans' reality, people are starting to have these kinds
3573680	3578720	of conversations. And I know this is like a very cliche thing to say, but people are starting to
3578720	3585680	question what is the human subject. People are delving more into metaphysics and philosophy.
3585680	3594000	And if you think about it, Stephen Hawking, he said that philosophy is dead. For me, now philosophy
3594400	3597680	is revuifying, because first of all, we are seeing the drawbacks in science
3597680	3601200	with quantum theory or the interpretation. Artificial intelligence, people are questioning.
3602240	3608080	And AI is, for me, the ultimate, the epitome of where it concludes, where with AI now is where
3608880	3614480	philosophy, religion, or certainly religion, philosophy, religion, and religion not at this
3614480	3621120	kind of fundamentalist naive, but the platonic, neoplatonic, that sense of religion,
3621840	3626720	or mysticism, whatnot. Because we're starting to ask questions about what is the human subject,
3626720	3632720	what's our relationship to reality, what is reality as such. And therefore, that's why,
3632720	3644080	you know, I believe with the failures of our society, it creates way for potential successes,
3644080	3651200	but not, again, not successes or not good in the techno-optimist sense, where it's going to
3651200	3654560	move towards some kind of synthesis and everything's going to work out. No, no.
3656000	3660480	The best way to approach this is to take the contradictions on and critique them and work
3660480	3665360	through them individually, do the hard work. It's certainly true, because we're critiquing
3665360	3670080	technology while using technology. Yeah, I mean, look at, this is the ultimate irony, right? This
3670080	3674800	is the ultimate irony, isn't it? Yeah. And, you know, we'll go one step further. You and I both
3674800	3681360	are tech bros. We work in tech. You work for a Web3 accelerator, which is the full
3681360	3687520	front of technology. I'm a software engineer. So this is the example of that.
3688000	3695520	Yeah, no, but we're actually full on tech bros. Yeah, I mean, the problem with tech bros is,
3695520	3700480	I would say tech bro-ism. It's, again, it's the ideology. And it's, again, it's not that you
3700480	3707520	can step outside of ideology, but the problem is this kind of, yeah. Yeah, look, I'm going to say
3707520	3714400	despite this is going to sound very arrogant, but naive and rather an infantile way of viewing
3714400	3720240	technology without any depth. And again, the point I made before, Heidegger wasn't a Luddite.
3720240	3725040	He was full of science and technology. He makes the point, in fact, to his end of the essay that,
3725840	3731120	but we need to start asking these questions about what is technology and what's, what's
3731120	3736560	its relationship to us as human subjects. And then again, what are human subjects? And I think AI
3737520	3743760	is allowing us to really have those conversations, which is why AI is an interdisciplinary field,
3743760	3748160	you know? So for me, that's kind of where the bit of the optimism comes in, although I'm very
3748160	3754400	careful when it comes to optimism, because again, it's the prevalent ideology of our day. So I'd
3754400	3759760	rather be cynical and pessimistic. I think you're right. And that's, yeah, that's a very important
3759760	3763040	thing to make clear, right? It's like Heidegger wasn't against technology, right? It's like,
3763040	3767200	Heidegger, I think you could say Heidegger was against the mode of being that kind of
3767200	3772800	encompassed technology, like kind of, let's be aware of that. But it's, what Heidegger is not
3772800	3777200	saying is like, do away with technology, become an aesthetic, right? And just, yeah, although he
3777200	3781520	kind of was like an aesthetic, he lived in a heart most of his life. Oh, right. I didn't know that.
3781520	3787680	Yeah, look, he's a Nazi weird guy. Honestly, Heidegger personally wouldn't want to be him,
3787680	3792560	but take his take his philosophy, you know, yeah, but yeah, obviously, I think there is
3792560	3798240	reason to be optimistic, right? Like as you say, and even from our like, what we're doing now,
3798240	3802240	this is enabled by technology, right? Like the fact that I can have this conversation,
3802320	3807440	like remotely, and that we can put it up and we can, like it's scalable, right? Like people can
3807440	3812400	watch it from wherever they want. And whenever, right, that's something, right? That's not
3812400	3817040	something that we could do. We talk a lot, we might, we might romanticize pre-modernity and like
3817040	3822640	this and that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I romanticize certain parts of it, but if you ask from me,
3822640	3828960	what's the best time to be alive? It's now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree, I agree. And so like right
3828960	3833120	now we're a lot more technologically able, like enable than we were before. We have like
3833120	3837440	extract, we have machines everywhere we look, right? We can do a lot more than we once did.
3837440	3844160	And that gives a lot of like power in terms of ideas such as this, right? Like it means that we
3844160	3849680	can discuss ideas such as this and like have much more reach and other people can discuss ideas like
3849680	3855600	this and have much more reach. And so like that's the reason to be optimistic within the information
3855600	3860080	age, I suppose. Okay, you and I think you misunderstood me there. My point wasn't even the
3860080	3865440	functionalist pragmatic point. That is true, that I agree with you certainly. But mine was more,
3865440	3871840	I was still working on the level of the metaphysics of technology. So given we're doing this
3871840	3878320	metaphysical analysis and we've, technologies reveal these things to us about being as such,
3878400	3886880	what I'm saying is, because technology does that, that allows us to, okay, I'll put it this way.
3886880	3893040	Let's say all of these tools, modern technology, whatever, the zoom, all these things weren't
3893040	3897520	there, they didn't exist. But technology, the metaphysics of technology was still there.
3899760	3904320	That's a bad view of putting it. What I'm trying to say is it's not the, I'm not trying to make
3904320	3909920	and it's not the instances or it's not this mic or zoom or the internet or what not. What I'm
3909920	3919600	saying is what, what technology reveals metaphysically, that itself allows us to have a conversation
3919600	3924560	about what the human subject is. If you could say it's kind of like, like Christianity technology
3924560	3932320	allows itself to be questioned and doubted. Yes, yes. In fact, yes, the Nietzschean point about
3932320	3937520	Christianity. Yeah. Yeah. So that's kind of the point I'm trying to make. I mean, of course,
3937520	3943440	these things are great, but by what technology reveals, we start having these questions on being
3943440	3951600	as such ontologically, ontological questions. But not man. Yeah. And that's, I think I kind of
3951600	3957520	exhausted everything I had to say. Anything else you want to add? I think I got the main points too.
3957520	3963920	But like, I always find it interesting, like even a line of thought that my mind's heading to right
3963920	3970640	now is, you know, even though we're so much more technologically enable now, we can do a lot more.
3970640	3977040	We've got power. It's all, you know, an interesting questionable sort of power, right? Perhaps it's
3977040	3983680	a good way to kind of conclude. And I think there's a certain element. There's a certain element to
3983680	3990640	human existence that's, I haven't quite figured this out, but it's the element of purity, right?
3990640	3996080	Like with, with the purity of being human, the purity of engaging with nature, there's a purity
3996080	4001200	of engaging with fellow humans, and somehow technology defiles that. And if we already discussed,
4003120	4008960	we've already discussed how that looks like, right? But I do wonder if there's a kind of, you know,
4009040	4021120	ideal state between, an ideal relation between man, nature, and, you know, other people in which
4021120	4025040	technology can be a part of the picture. That's probably a crucial, one of the crucial questions
4025040	4030560	that we have to ask, right, these days. But not one, it's not one that I have, you know, a proper
4030560	4034880	answer to. It's like, there are many different ways to approach it. And it's kind of like, I don't
4034880	4038960	know, do you want to lean into it? You know, do you want to become a techno futurist and like
4038960	4042480	reinvent how everyone does things? There's something there. Do you want to become, you know,
4042480	4047600	a primitive, you know, like, like, go and retreat into nature and like, you know, like,
4047600	4054320	like, yeah, like, yeah, like, there's also something there. So, yeah, they are not
4054320	4058960	co-primitivists. I'm not a fan of that. Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess we both want to conclude
4058960	4062800	where do what Heidegger did and ask the question concerning technology.
4064160	4070560	Yeah. And let the answer be, you know, let your answer be a truth for you, as Kierkegaard would
4070560	4077280	say. Yes. And make it a truth that shakes you, because the Kierkegaardian truths are always
4077280	4080400	the kind of truths that uproot you. And that's important.
