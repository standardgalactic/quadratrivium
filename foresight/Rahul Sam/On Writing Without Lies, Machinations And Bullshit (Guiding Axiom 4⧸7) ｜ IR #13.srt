00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the NRLM podcast and today

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,920
I'll be reading out guiding axiom number four that I wrote for my newsletter, The Unhappy Man.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,960
And in case you haven't been following these axioms that I've been

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,880
animerating in the past couple episodes, essentially there were seven axioms I

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,800
laid down for my newsletter, The Unhappy Man, as I did mention before. And I

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,320
realized, wow, by me writing and thinking clearly, these axioms that I'm laying

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,320
down really are a framework for all of my creative work. And that obviously includes

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,480
this podcast and whatever, interviews, scripts, I don't know,

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,920
dispositions, whatever I do on this podcast, I'm hoping to do it via these

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,920
axioms, via this framework. And I certainly don't want it to be

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,040
something that confines me or something that sort of, let's say, that doesn't

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,320
allow me to, that shackles me. I'd rather hope that it's a good place to start

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,800
from, and then open up into somewhere because I mean, I need some kind of stable

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,520
footing. And that's why I thought it's wise and prudent, especially given my

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,240
nature to get lost in obscure thoughts and sometimes nonsense. It's healthy to

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,360
have some axioms, especially at a respectful reader or a listener in this

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:35,520
case. So axiom number four, five, and six, I don't want to just do what I have

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,120
been doing in the previous episodes, or the previous axioms that I've been

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,480
reading out, where I've mostly been just reading it out of the essay I've

20
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,360
written. Rather, I want to maybe pause in the middle, have a bit of commentary,

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,800
expand as, you know, the good thing about a podcast is it allows me to do that.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,280
And I think the reason for that is because I realized, you know, laying down

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,120
these axioms, because I wasn't writing a lot at that time, it took me a bit of

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,600
time to be about three to four months, not because they're deep and profound or

25
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:14,960
dense in any way. In my opinion, they're pretty superficial, not too deep

26
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,680
thinking. However, well, the reason it took a long time is because I just had

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,840
other commitments. I couldn't write that much. However, what I was trying to make

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:34,400
was that in those few months itself, I've been reflecting a lot on kind of a

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,800
revelation, let's say, that I had in the past two years or so. It wasn't a

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,000
sudden thing. It wasn't one event. It was a gradual change I had in my thinking.

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,360
Both existentially, theologically, and as a result of that, perhaps,

32
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,800
philosophically. And these three axioms, so four, five, six, that I'm going to cover

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,400
for today and then five and six in future episodes, they're really important for me.

34
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,520
They are important in the sense that they're very existentially put into the

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,320
current place I'm in life. And I'm trying to deeply read thinkers such as

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,280
Slavoj Žižek, Hortelik, and Nietzsche of Coz, and recently even the theologian Peter

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,960
Rollins. These thinkers have had an unbelievable impact on how I viewed

38
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,360
everything, especially Christianity, given that I'm a Christian. And therefore,

39
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,240
because in many ways my identity comes from that relationship I have with

40
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,480
Christianity and Christ, when my Christian beliefs are subverted, I myself am subverted.

41
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,240
So these these axioms are important for me, four, five, and six, and I hope to

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,760
carry on this podcast in the spirit of these axioms as I've said many times before.

43
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,320
Anyway, that's enough of a introduction or prelude. I shall get started. Today is

44
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,720
guiding axiom number four. It's called on writing, or in this case on podcasting,

45
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,200
without lies, machinations, and bullshit. And of course, since I didn't mention in that

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,760
unnecessarily long introduction, the link to the original article or essay is down

47
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,440
in the description along with the other guiding axioms too. It's infinitely easier to know of a

48
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:32,160
lie than what is true. Existentially, a lie is not a mere untrue, but an utterance of non-being.

49
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,040
I got this term from Paul Tillich, by the way. And to be aware of non-being is more than the

50
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,400
conceptual theoretical understanding of a philosophical concept. Once it's felt spiritually,

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,360
the anxiety it imbues can leave one perturbed and unhinged. Such as why Paul Tillich states,

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,640
anxiety is the existential awareness of non-being, the courage to be, page 35.

53
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,800
The anxiety Tillich writes of is not the medicalized kind a psychiatrist would prescribe a drug to

54
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,640
or a new age self-help guru would try to solve with a mindfulness course. It's inescapably

55
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,560
a part of our being. In fact, Tillich says that this anxiety is ontological. As he continues

56
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,000
on the courage to be page 36, perhaps I should not keep reading out the page numbers because

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,160
that's kind of annoying, isn't it? I'll just say the name of the book and obviously in the

58
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,880
original article that I'll link below, you'll see all the sources and pages and whatnot.

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,920
So getting back to this, existential in this sentence means that it is not the abstract

60
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,800
knowledge of non-being which produces anxiety, but the awareness that non-being is a part of

61
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:59,120
one's own being. Anxiety is finitude, experienced as one's own finitude. This is the natural

62
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,760
anxiety of man as man and in some way of all living beings, it is the anxiety of non-being,

63
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:13,040
the awareness of one's finitude as finitude. So in this play of words that Tillich is doing here,

64
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,960
what I understood it to be as that what we talk of anxiety angst or the idea of finitude, it is

65
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,760
it is ontic in nature. It is the starting point. It isn't, in that sense, perhaps he gets it from

66
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,040
psychoanalysis where, you know, I think the Freudian notion is, I mean, no way an expert

67
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:38,960
in psychoanalysis, but my very superficial reading is that being born into this world itself is

68
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,200
traumatic. It's trauma. We're born with trauma and our embellishment into being is a traumatic event

69
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,840
which is why, you know, it goes on to the rest of psychoanalysis, repression, whatnot, hysteria.

70
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,200
Therefore, I see anxiety in the same way. I see it as not something to be killed,

71
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,720
despite, due to our own peril in my opinion, we've overtly medicalized it, but that's a whole

72
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,560
other topic and in fact, it's a podcast that I'm going to do soon. I'm currently writing the script

73
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,080
because it's a sensitive topic for many people. I want to be punctilious and I would say more

74
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,720
respectful as to how I do it. Getting back to the essay, despite being encompassing non-being

75
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,520
and the impossibility of a jettisoning existential anxiety, lying exacerbates the looming threat

76
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,480
of non-being and make one's constitutive ontic anxiety pathological. You're aware of that's

77
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,240
actuality. That at one arbitrary point in life, everything culminates in a nothingness.

78
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,960
Despite you not knowing what this nothing truly entails, you have intimations of its eminence

79
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,520
and yet you can cope with death. But if you lie and deceive in your finite existence, not only does

80
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,160
death verge upon you insufferably, but your life becomes so agonizingly hellish that you'd wish

81
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,600
you were dead already. This means we identify a lie or truth best not by the cognizance of

82
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,200
correspondence or objective facts, the way a theoretician or a scientist would do with a given

83
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:28,480
problem, but primarily by being attentive to one's inner thoughts, emotions and psychic states when

84
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,400
ushering or writing something. In that vein, metaphysically speaking, if the universe is made

85
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:42,320
up of facts, the trueness or falseness of a fact necessitates a human being who are designed to use

86
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:50,160
how to give into terminology to come to being. Case in point, Martin Luther, the father of the

87
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,280
Protestant Reformation, was a little known priest in 1517. This was until he famously hammered his

88
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:04,480
95 pieces onto the doors of Old Saints Church in the border town of Wittenberg, Saxony, modern-day

89
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,280
Germany, subsequently stirring up a storm across a whole of Europe and eventually every corner of

90
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:18,640
the world. His list began the ongoing dissension between the hegemony of the Roman Catholic Church

91
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,360
and its opponents, colloquially known as the Protestants, and secularly precipitated leftism.

92
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,320
This is true, I believe that Martin Luther was pretty much the first leftist. I'll start that

93
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,880
sentence from the top, and secularly precipitated leftism, anti-statism and modernity as a whole.

94
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,480
One could argue that many momentous historical revolutions and social movements,

95
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:50,080
from the French Revolution to the civil rights movement, could be pointed to this ostensibly

96
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,200
simple act by Luther, which he intended only to start an academic debate.

97
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:04,320
At the time, the absolute theocratic authority of the Church led to Luther's excommunication

98
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,600
by Pope Leo X, and he was called to the diet of worms, a formal deliberative assembly,

99
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,960
and demanded to recant his heretical statements over risk being burnt at the stake. In his

100
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:25,120
intransigency, notwithstanding the risk of dying a brutal death, he famously responded,

101
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,680
my conscience is captive to the word of God, thus I cannot and will not recant,

102
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,600
because acting against one's conscience is neither safe nor sound. Here I stand, I can do no other,

103
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,760
God help me. Since we live in secular times and are detached from a pre-reform society,

104
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,440
we can't understand the significance of Luther's actions. No reading of history will

105
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,960
help us realize the radical change he set forth in humanity. However, we all have our own

106
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,120
distinctive moments of here I stand, I can do no other. Luther believed to have found

107
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:11,040
metaphysical truths about being, of course, perhaps I will not, perhaps if I rewrote this,

108
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,040
I would probably have not put the word metaphysical in there, because after reading Heidegger,

109
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,920
I'm beginning to question the whole project of metaphysics itself, so I don't know if

110
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:29,120
Luther really was talking about metaphysical truths in that sense, so I would just leave it as

111
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,960
Luther believed to have found truths about being. Okay, back to the essay. But all he had to stand

112
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:42,080
by was his conscience, not an objective theory of any kind. His only way to discern truth from

113
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,840
untruth was solely himself. If he recanted his statements, he would be telling the greatest

114
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,960
of lies by defining his conscience. This he couldn't live with, which is why he can do no other.

115
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,240
You and I have very little in common with Luther except for this phenomenon of being,

116
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,080
creatures with an inescapable, idiosyncratic conscience.

117
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,480
Leaving aside obstruous metaphysics and ontology, in our daily lives, in certain immediate

118
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,600
particularities, we find truths above truth, but ourselves and conceivably the largest structural

119
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,640
whole of reality itself. So we ought to pay attention to our lives with the utmost rigor.

120
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,120
A lie is more than asserting an unfactual statement, because it's not withstanding

121
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,240
machinations to obfuscate and masquerade lies as truth, even if we convince everyone to accept

122
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,120
a lie as being true, when one lies, one knows. And to make matters worse, we are also self-deceiving.

123
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,840
We must stop fooling ourselves into thinking that our emphatical will is the will to an

124
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:58,640
unprejudiced truth, far from it. Kierkegaard, in his oblique characteristic Mao, was a

125
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,080
philosopher who expounded best on finite man's susceptibility to self-deception.

126
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,960
For instance, he was highly skeptical of Aristotelian virtue ethics and moral philosophy.

127
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,920
A Kierkegaardian would find living man as solely a rational creature of moral reasoning to be

128
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,560
unduly naive about the human capacity for radical evil.

129
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:30,000
Despite at times its spuriousness and unreliability, the findings of psychoanalysis tell us that we

130
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,720
cannot acontextually and abstractly follow an objective morality. Even when we think we are

131
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,360
doing so, it could be self-deception. Comprehending this datum doesn't necessarily require reading

132
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,960
the labyrinth of existentialism and moral philosophy, although we all ought to. Rather,

133
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,400
being attentive to ourselves will suffice. Recall the last time you unequivocally knew

134
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,600
you were doing something wrong, not new in the sense of knowing some historical fact or political

135
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:09,280
theory that it would regurgitate to sound smart, but you felt a pang of profound guilt and visceral

136
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:15,440
disgust towards yourself for a certain act. Amidst the moment, you hated who you were and couldn't

137
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,640
relieve your conscience of this psychospiritual distress. At such times, most of us who would

138
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,720
justify our subjective shortcomings that are supposed to be on par with our personal telos

139
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,320
would conjure up any reason to tell ourselves we are not at fault, our intent was good or there

140
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,680
was no real harm done, etc. And who could blame us? Life is hard and occasionally, perhaps always,

141
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:51,840
out of pure pragmatism similar to cypher in the matrix, we choose to live in convenient lies

142
00:14:51,840 --> 00:15:00,960
as ignorance is bliss for most of us. In many ways, Nietzsche completed Kedricat's

143
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,040
essentialism by hammering home the point that even our conscious decisions and social structures

144
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:13,920
we're put in, for example, the revealed scientific institutions aren't oriented towards uppercase

145
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:24,160
T truth. Nietzsche writes, even scientific inquiry itself, our science indeed, what does

146
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,720
all scientific inquiry in general mean, considered as a symptom of life? What is the point of all

147
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,200
that science and even more serious, where did it come from? What about that? Is scientific scholarship

148
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:45,040
perhaps only a fear and an excuse in the face of pessimism? A delicate self-defense against

149
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,360
the truth? And speaking morally, sometimes like cowardice and falsehood, speaking un morally,

150
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,440
a clever trick. Oh Socrates, Socrates, was that perhaps your secret or your secretive

151
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:06,160
ironness? Was that perhaps your irony? Gosh, I can never get over and not ever fall in love with

152
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,120
Nietzsche's prose. It's just bizarre. I can't believe he writes like that. So what does it mean

153
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,520
to be an authentic and truthful writer in this utter confusion of existence? It's someone who

154
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:24,080
doesn't write bullshit. Unlike a liar who might at least have the pretense of being concerned for

155
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:31,200
the truth, Harry G. Frankfurt expounds that bullshit is speech or writing by a bullshit artist

156
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:38,880
without any regard for truth at all. Instead, he is predominantly aiming to be solely persuasive

157
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,040
and change a listener or reader without convincing someone that something is true.

158
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:52,640
It's even done unconsciously as Frankfurt elucidates in his paper. Our natures are indeed

159
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:59,680
elusively insubstantial, notoriously less stable and less inherent than the natures of other things.

160
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:08,240
And in so far as this is the case, sincerity itself is bullshit. Ergo, we ought to never confuse

161
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:15,680
our sensible authenticity in speaking or writing as being truthful. Sincerity itself could be a tool

162
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:22,800
used for deception. One can never truly know if one is being truthful. Much like love,

163
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:28,960
truth is an article of faith. One falls into it and thereafter decides to pursue it. Pause,

164
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,120
just a point here. When I mean one falls into it, I certainly don't mean it's a complete arbitrary

165
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,240
chaotic random event. You know, finding truth or falling in love. For both to happen, to find

166
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,840
truth and even to fall in love, I believe we have to, as a subject, orient ourselves towards

167
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,280
the fall, so to speak. And I'm going to write about this in the future. Once we fall, we have to

168
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,560
decide to be fallen. Therefore, it's not a mere chaotic irrational event completely out of our

169
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,720
control. We not very much, or ultimately perhaps, but in many ways we do have control at least

170
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,280
as to how we orient ourselves and as to how we are ready to find love or find truth.

171
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,200
Alright, back to the essay. Essentially speaking, which is the only way one ought to speak about

172
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,080
such matters, this is why truth is an orientation, as I had said before. The intent of an individual

173
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,640
and a state of being one chooses to embody rather than a destination, set of facts or propositions.

174
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,360
In that sense, one could make an unfactual statement due to their ignorance, but still not

175
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,920
be a liar, or bush it up, as he is still aiming at being a seeker of truth, notwithstanding

176
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,720
his proclivity to be fallible due to the sheer fact of being human. Of course, an outside observer

177
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,640
cannot empirically verify this, it's entirely left to one's conscience, so perhaps one should

178
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,520
be petrified of lying and striving to be an arbiter of truth. Sojournetsen was right when he wrote,

179
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,680
the simple step of a courageous individual is not to take part in the lie. Subjectivity is truth.

180
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,880
And this leads to one of the most contentious statements of this essay.

181
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:29,360
While I'll strive for objectivity, pause. I had to pause there and think, because I don't even

182
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,200
know what I mean as strive for objectivity, what that means. Perhaps the more apt term is

183
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:43,440
while I'll strive for a trans subjectivity, a common subjectivity, if that makes any sense at all,

184
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,440
because I'm commonly believed that we have no way of knowing what's objectively true.

185
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,520
It's something that just doesn't comprehend. It's not something that I can resonate with,

186
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,680
objective truth in that sense. All right, back to the essay. I don't want to over complicate this,

187
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,480
just want to, at least in some sense, stick to the essay.

188
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,720
I'll start again on that. I kind of screwed up that sentence.

189
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,680
So subjectivity is truth. And this leads to one of the most contentious statements of this essay.

190
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,440
While I'll strive for objectivity, I need to realize that for the type of being we are,

191
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,120
that is human and not God, subjectivity is true. In his trenchant critique of German

192
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,240
idealism and ardent emphasis on existence to be with an inwardness over abstract theorizing,

193
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,920
yet again, it was Kerkregat who expounds, and even introduced to the western mind, perhaps,

194
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,880
the notion of truth that matters above all other truths is the subjective one.

195
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,840
Sarat, of course, appropriated this project for a secular world with this atheistic

196
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,400
existentialism of radical freedom. I'm more a Kerkregadian than a Saratrian, as I'm a religious

197
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,800
Nietzschean. That is to say, God does not exist objectively, but purely subjectively. And what

198
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,320
matters is not the afterlife, but the present one. Therefore, I'll write through the lens of

199
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:20,960
subjective truth and be primarily concerned with subjectivity. Kerkregat writes in concluding

200
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:28,480
unscientific postscript, Christianity protests against every form of objectivity. He desires

201
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,880
that the subject should be infinitely concerned about himself. It is with subjectivity that

202
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,760
Christianity is concerned, and it is only in subjectively that its truth exists. If it exists

203
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:50,720
at all, objectively, Christianity has absolutely no existence. If the truth happens to be only in

204
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,760
a single subject, it exists in him alone. And there is greater Christian joy in heaven over

205
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,080
this one individual than over universal history or the system. I like that last bit because he's

206
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:14,640
sort of mocking Hegel there. For him, God is a subject and therefore requires a subject-to-subject

207
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:22,080
relation. Of course, I'm not sure if that's true. I know, I thought that was the case when I wrote it,

208
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,360
but after reading Paul Tillich, who was also influenced by Kerkregat, I'm not sure if Kerkregat

209
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:35,280
believed God was just a subject or if God transcends the object-subject binary. Tillich thinks

210
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,480
that certainly to be the case, he believes God does transcend that binary, and so do I.

211
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,160
So I need to take that sentence with a grain of salt because I'm not sure if that's true.

212
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,360
Back to the essay. This is why old religious scripture discloses truth, not systems to us

213
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:02,160
subjects. Similarly, this idea could be secularly reappropriated for our ordinary life,

214
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:09,360
which entails being subjective and dealing with other subjects, and unsurprisingly when people

215
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,360
are treated any differently, it infuriates them. For instance, a feminist has right to say the

216
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,240
objectification of women is wrong, but ironically, this so-called objectification is a subjective

217
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,840
passion of, let's say, male chauvinism. So nonetheless, it's a subject-to-subject relation.

218
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,560
We cannot escape subjectivity. Perhaps if I wrote purely about the objective natural sciences,

219
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,200
this statement might not wholly apply. That too is questionable since it's us who do the science.

220
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,680
In any case, since the unhappy man is about the individual, there's no decoupling or universalizing

221
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,440
the human experience from it. And subjectivity is what it ultimately means to be a human being,

222
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,760
banan. Such as why Sartre rightly argued against Freud's empirical psychoanalysis

223
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,680
that attempts to schematize a human mind via a collection of observations. For Sartre,

224
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:11,600
the psyche is irreducible. Ergo, I am deeply skeptical of psychometrics that attempts to

225
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,200
prescribe identities to individuals through its lust for categorizing, for example,

226
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,280
gender differences. A cognitive scientist could study the qualia, qualities of the world as perceived

227
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:29,920
and experienced by us, of a human subject experiencing the color red, a footy game,

228
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:38,240
or Tchaikovsky's piano concerto number one, Opus 23, and analyze the subject's brain waves,

229
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:45,120
heart rate, facial expressions, etc. And convince himself he has an empirical objective,

230
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,960
even ontological understanding of a person. But it'll be a great act of self-deception

231
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,520
and scientific malady to presume he precisely knows what an individual, or the subject he's

232
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,440
studying in particular, is experiencing in a way that his findings could replace the actual human

233
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,560
being. A psychometrition could categorize human beings into the taxonomy of personality traits

234
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:18,480
such as the big five at infinitum, but never settle on what the actual existence of an individual

235
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,600
entails, which is why those traits are an ever-growing enumeration. And of course, no Shakespearean

236
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,920
sonnet, no matter how breathtakingly poetic, will truly capture what it means for you and me

237
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:40,080
to fall in love. In essence, every human being is the eternal distinction in reality, because

238
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:48,080
the individual who has become is to be and is becoming will have a life no one or thing ever will.

239
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:55,120
In that sense, the only verity we can be sure of is that we are all eternally lonely in this world.

240
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:03,040
The synagogue for writing on human experience is the epistemic humility to know that I will invariably

241
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:10,400
fail at tapping into a person's subjective truth, and will only be able to delineate my subjectivity,

242
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,440
at least that which is effable. Therefore, I write at the risk of being utterly nonsensical,

243
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,040
and to be an authentic writer is to accept that writing will never fully encompass

244
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:31,200
existence, specifically that of a soul reader. In that vein, to write well is to know the limits of writing.
