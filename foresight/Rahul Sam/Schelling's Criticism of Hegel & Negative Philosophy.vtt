00:00.000 --> 00:07.200
What I see from your White Hellion work, Matt, is that in contrast to, let's say Peter Rollins or

00:07.200 --> 00:12.800
even Jack, kind of the apathetic theology, it seems so much of their theology is focused on

00:12.800 --> 00:18.720
negativity and probably makes sense given their Hegelians, the negative aspect of God or like

00:18.720 --> 00:24.320
the self-divided God. Whereas I do see, and it's in many ways, you know, in like our kind of like

00:24.320 --> 00:31.120
post-modern kind of culture, this is a breath of fresh air that Whitehead, he in fact, he asserts,

00:31.120 --> 00:37.520
he puts forward a positive philosophy through especially the ideas of like creativity and

00:37.520 --> 00:45.840
imagination, which is a big thing for you. So, well, what really is that kind of positive orientation

00:45.840 --> 00:52.640
in Whiteheadian process theology, would you say, in contrast to more of the kind of the negative

00:52.640 --> 00:58.960
apathetic theology that we hear more from the Jackians in our times?

01:01.280 --> 01:06.080
I think, you know, it's very, I don't know if this is intentional on your part or if you know

01:06.080 --> 01:13.280
much about Shelling's positive philosophy, which was his late philosophical contribution at the

01:13.280 --> 01:20.320
University of Berlin after Hegel's death, where, you know, this connects to process theology

01:20.320 --> 01:24.560
and Whitehead's work as well, where Shelling basically looked back at his own earlier work

01:25.360 --> 01:32.880
and the work of Hegel and criticized it as a form of negative philosophy, which

01:34.080 --> 01:41.760
was merely conceptual. And if it were to have been more upfront about the fact that it's merely

01:41.760 --> 01:48.240
conceptual, it wouldn't be a problem. But he thinks, you know, he's very critical in particular

01:48.240 --> 01:54.160
of Hegel's attempt to transition from the logic to the philosophy of nature, where there's this

01:54.160 --> 02:00.480
sense in which the logic just freely releases itself into actual existence. And, you know,

02:00.480 --> 02:13.360
Shelling just didn't see how one could make that transition from the process of negation by which

02:13.360 --> 02:23.280
this dialectical logic could unfold to actual positive existence. And, you know, Kierkegaard was

02:23.280 --> 02:29.360
at Shelling's late lectures, and many of Kierkegaard's critiques of Hegel come straight out of

02:29.360 --> 02:38.240
Shelling's late criticisms. And what Shelling wanted to offer as a remedy to this situation,

02:38.240 --> 02:43.120
because he admitted his own earlier philosophy was also a negative philosophy in the sense that it,

02:43.120 --> 02:54.000
you know, was relying too much on the conceptual activity of negation

02:56.080 --> 03:02.800
in an attempt to derive actual knowledge, where what Shelling wanted to seek in his late philosophy

03:02.800 --> 03:11.600
was a more existential relationship to actual existence. And he called it a kind of metaphysical

03:11.600 --> 03:20.320
empiricism, where we're not so much concerned with what the structure, the conceptual structure

03:20.320 --> 03:30.000
of reality is. We're more concerned with the fact that anything exists at all. And, you know, he says

03:30.000 --> 03:36.400
that the fact that anything exists at all cannot be explained rationally would be his claim that

03:36.400 --> 03:47.040
there's something unprethinkable or un-oprioriable about just the sheer fact of existence. And so,

03:47.040 --> 03:52.800
I mean, I think we can safely say that existentialism is kind of born in these late lectures of Shelling's.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.000
And, you know, he also frames this as a kind of

03:58.880 --> 04:07.440
critique of feeling, Shelling does. And he says, he makes this interesting comment. I think I

04:07.440 --> 04:14.320
mentioned it in my book about how Yakkant tried to do in his third critique, this examination,

04:14.320 --> 04:24.720
a transcendental examination of feeling and esthesis and so on. But, you know, he didn't follow

04:24.720 --> 04:29.200
through fully and he discovered things in that final critique of judgment, as I said earlier,

04:29.200 --> 04:35.360
about the living world, but also about aesthetics and our relationship to the sublime and so on,

04:35.360 --> 04:41.520
that in many ways undermined some of the systematic claims he made in his first critique.

04:43.360 --> 04:48.000
And so, you know, Shelling just drops this hint about that we still need a critique of feeling.

04:48.640 --> 04:53.360
And Whitehead later in Process and Reality, I don't, I'm pretty sure, I'm almost certain he

04:53.360 --> 04:58.240
didn't read these late lectures of Shelling's. I know he had read at least some excerpts of Shelling's

04:58.800 --> 05:04.000
in a book by a Russian philosopher named Velosky, so he was aware of Shelling.

05:04.960 --> 05:09.520
But he almost certainly didn't read these late lectures on positive philosophy.

05:09.520 --> 05:16.960
But Whitehead says, again, in response to Kant, that he wants to replace this critique of pure

05:16.960 --> 05:22.960
reason with a critique of pure feeling. And his whole process philosophy is an attempt

05:23.760 --> 05:27.520
to do so. And he also says, you know, in the first critique of pure reason,

05:27.520 --> 05:34.720
Kant has these 20 pages on the transcendental aesthetic, where he, you know, articulates

05:34.720 --> 05:40.160
his view of space and time as forms of our own intuition. And Whitehead says,

05:41.040 --> 05:48.000
his whole book should have been about that, and not just this quick little 20 page aside.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.640
You mentioned crossing the threshold, yeah.

05:52.640 --> 05:59.920
Yeah, exactly. And so, you know, and then basically Whitehead's philosophy of organism

05:59.920 --> 06:03.520
in the final interpretation ends up being a lot like absolute idealism,

06:03.760 --> 06:07.600
in terms of the relationship between God and the world and the human

06:09.360 --> 06:18.800
self-consciousness and the divine. But as he himself puts it, he's putting

06:20.960 --> 06:25.760
philosophy on a realistic basis instead of an idealistic basis, because he's not

06:26.880 --> 06:32.400
doing philosophy in an attempt to build up this hierarchy of categories of thought,

06:32.400 --> 06:40.160
he says, but rather a hierarchy of feeling. And once to root all of our human knowing,

06:41.360 --> 06:51.760
thinking activity and our knowledge in a kind of, I think of him as basically saying that knowledge

06:51.760 --> 06:58.080
itself is a form of feeling. Our conceptual activity, conceptual prehension in his terms,

06:58.080 --> 07:02.480
is a form of feeling, just we're feeling possibilities rather than feeling actualities.

07:03.120 --> 07:07.360
And so he wants to put reason and mind back in the world, back in the body,

07:08.240 --> 07:14.400
and put the body back in the context of a living universe. And so in this context, you know, positive

07:15.440 --> 07:22.400
philosophy is another way of thinking about this recharged form of empiricism.

07:23.200 --> 07:28.560
Shelling called it metaphysical empiricism. William James, very influential for Whitehead,

07:28.560 --> 07:36.160
called it radical empiricism, where it's not that Whitehead wasn't aware of the importance

07:37.120 --> 07:48.560
of negation in the context of logical dialectics, but he accepts this pragmatist critique of

07:48.560 --> 07:55.920
idealistic philosophy and really wants our concepts to be adequate to experience and

07:56.720 --> 08:02.320
applicable to experience and, yeah, pragmatically useful. And like the test of any concept

08:02.880 --> 08:07.200
for Whitehead is, well, to what extent does it elucidate our experience, including our practical

08:07.200 --> 08:15.920
experience? So, yeah, hopefully, hopefully that gets at this question of the shift from the negative

08:15.920 --> 08:20.160
to the positive. Most certainly does, most certainly does. And in fact, just to answer your

08:20.160 --> 08:26.960
question, Matt, but I'm aware of Shelling's late lectures. The answer is no, because my only

08:26.960 --> 08:32.640
education of Shelling is from Frederick Beyser, and this great guy on the internet called Footnotes

08:32.640 --> 08:38.000
to Play Doh. So I need to, I probably need to, well, do you know what those lectures are called?

08:38.000 --> 08:43.600
I just, I just, I may just call Shelling's late lectures or? The grounding of positive

08:43.600 --> 08:49.760
philosophy. I mean, so only, only, only some of those lectures have been translated up to this

08:49.760 --> 08:55.360
point into English. I don't know if you read German. I don't, I don't, I'm working on it,

08:55.360 --> 09:02.720
but I don't, I don't yet have the ability to really study the original. But SUNY, the State

09:02.720 --> 09:09.680
University of New York has published a lot of Shelling's late lectures. And under the title,

09:09.680 --> 09:15.520
The Grounding of Positive Philosophy, Bruce Matthews is the translator. They've also,

09:15.520 --> 09:22.800
SUNY has published some of his Philosophy of Mythology. I think it's under the title,

09:22.800 --> 09:25.840
The Historical Critical Introduction to the Philosophy of Mythology.

09:29.120 --> 09:33.440
So that's what's available in English at this point. Yeah. And these, these were all lectures

09:33.440 --> 09:39.920
he gave in the University of Berlin beginning in 1841, I believe. Yeah.

09:40.560 --> 09:49.360
Excellent. Excellent. If I could find that, I'll leave a link down below in the description.
