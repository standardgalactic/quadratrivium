Speaking of David, I would like to revisit the the agony of heroes because this is certainly I

00:05.520 --> 00:10.720
think but I think it's the same for you burnout and agony of heroes are my favorite. I've only read

00:11.360 --> 00:18.160
probably four or five of his books. So I certainly love this book. One point I want to make about

00:18.160 --> 00:21.120
the the agony of heroes and I don't know what your thoughts on this are.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.560
So we talk a lot about this like the other and how the other can be a complete alien other and

00:28.560 --> 00:37.680
then they kind of disturb our sameness, our controlled life. But I really like the kind

00:37.680 --> 00:43.120
of the notion that Alan Bajor makes that yes, it's true that the other is completely alien.

00:43.120 --> 00:50.240
You can never plan the love event in that sense. But when when when when two love he says love

00:50.240 --> 00:56.720
takes two and in the event of love by allowing yourself to like opening yourself up to the other

00:57.440 --> 01:02.960
there is a higher truth or a newer truth created. So love becomes a project in that sense. So it's

01:02.960 --> 01:08.560
not that the other is a complete alien and then you know your life is complete chaos. But through

01:08.560 --> 01:14.720
this again it's paradoxically through opening yourself up to this other you in some sense you

01:14.720 --> 01:21.520
find a truth even about yourself. And I'm wondering like I don't know if that makes sense. I'm sorry

01:21.520 --> 01:25.840
if I'm being a bit long winded. No, no, no, no. Just like if you want to comment on that because

01:25.840 --> 01:31.920
for me that's a beautiful idea of like letting ourselves love and opening us up to the other.

01:33.360 --> 01:40.160
Yeah, I think maybe something that you also are you're also expressing in that with that sentiment

01:40.160 --> 01:50.720
is the idea that the other is not just outside that it's an inner inner other too that you

01:50.720 --> 02:01.120
discover about yourself. That this logic of sameness is imposition that we do we also impose it on

02:01.120 --> 02:09.360
ourselves. Like the idea of waking up and planning every minute since the moment you wake up until

02:09.360 --> 02:14.160
the moment optimizing everything. Optimization is really based based on the assumption that I know

02:14.160 --> 02:23.600
myself. I know what I can do and I know what I want to do. But it's a it's a very dull life if I

02:23.600 --> 02:28.880
operate with the assumption that I know everything about myself I know what I'm what I should do.

02:29.520 --> 02:39.840
So yeah, I agree that it's in our relationships that we find aspects of ourselves that we wouldn't

02:40.320 --> 02:48.000
find. A long time ago I had a friend who is a very close friend and in a moment in the

02:48.000 --> 02:54.800
sentimental moment she told me if I don't talk with you for too long I will forget who I am.

02:56.240 --> 03:02.880
And it really made me think I feel I feel like that's a general statement that we could apply

03:02.880 --> 03:10.000
to all good friendships and if we don't get in touch with our good friends we will really lose

03:10.000 --> 03:15.840
touch with ourselves because they they provide us with a place a good friendship or good conversation

03:15.840 --> 03:23.840
it provides provides us with with a place to be to do well get to to to express who we are

03:24.400 --> 03:32.080
and then be responded to and in that dialogue we find something and that part of that

03:32.080 --> 03:40.000
something is is ourselves but it's not the narcissistic self it's the is the other self

03:41.360 --> 03:47.760
if you will. Yeah you know and and how have you found because I was going to read out it's a bit

03:47.760 --> 03:52.400
of a mouthful so let me in fact as the book ends the the agony of heroes and I'm so glad you brought

03:52.400 --> 03:58.240
up your friend because the the part I'm going to read is about friendship uh so Bianca Lan ends

03:58.240 --> 04:04.400
the the book saying the philosopher is a friend a lover here the lover is not an

04:05.040 --> 04:12.640
outward personality uh an empirical circumstance but a presence that is intrinsic to thought

04:12.640 --> 04:20.960
the condition of possibility of thought itself a living category a transcendental lived reality

04:20.960 --> 04:26.880
and this is perhaps my favorite part because this idea of thinking uh thinking in the strong

04:26.880 --> 04:34.480
sense begins with heroes to be able to think one must first have been a friend a lover

04:35.360 --> 04:43.520
without heroes thinking loses all vitality and turmoil and becomes repetitive and reactive

04:44.560 --> 04:53.280
heroes uh infuses thinking with desire for the atopic other so you know and this your friend

04:53.280 --> 04:59.680
said that um she she kind of forgets even who she is unless she's in dialogue with you and I

04:59.680 --> 05:05.680
I'd say I have a lot of friends in my life where I do know if I don't talk to them eventually I

05:05.680 --> 05:14.080
start forgetting even who I am I love that line thank you for reading that to be able to think

05:14.080 --> 05:24.560
one must first have been a friend a lover it's so true and it you know because people who have

05:24.560 --> 05:30.560
an interest in philosophy and have been involved with philosophy for years they might forget that

05:31.200 --> 05:37.840
that it didn't begin with an interest in a given book or a philosophical question

05:38.560 --> 05:44.560
it began as maybe in a context of a relationship with the teacher or with a friend with a person

05:44.560 --> 05:53.600
who seemed very intriguing uh there was friendliness there at the bottom and uh that's why a lot of

05:53.600 --> 06:00.960
times philosophical questions begin with a line of thought with something like uh what is love

06:00.960 --> 06:07.680
what is true love or or you know in some movies characters ask each other can men and women really

06:07.680 --> 06:12.480
be just friends and you know that's you have a relationship with someone and within that within

06:12.480 --> 06:19.120
the context of a relationship friendship those questions are are posed yeah you know but the

06:19.120 --> 06:25.360
engine of those questions is their relationship that's the idea but it's so easy to forget that

06:25.360 --> 06:28.400
and that that itself is also interesting that we forget
