00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I completely got your critiques of predictive processing, which I concur with, but what are

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,760
your views on something like the free energy principle by Carl Friston, who, after all,

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,800
is a neuroscientist. Would you say it's a good model of framework to work with?

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,440
No, I think it's a bogus analogy. It's obviously an analogy because the term comes from physics.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,920
In free energy, there's a perfectly well-understood idea where energy is the

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,920
capacity to work, and free energy is the energy that's available in the current

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,200
contest to do work. Great idea, really important. So what's the free energy principle? Well,

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,240
people who are big fans of predictive processing have worked their butts off to try to figure out

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,120
what it is. And Friston's a horrible writer. He writes with incredible obscurity. He writes

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,880
like a postmodernist, actually, kind of postmodernist mathematician. And that's not what

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,840
mathematics is supposed to be like. Mathematics is incredibly powerful because it's clear,

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,120
and you can see what's going on. But his math is unclear, and the free energy principle

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,840
is what I call a bogus analogy. The term comes from my book, Balance. I wrote a book on balance

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,880
a couple of years ago, and it talks both about the neuroscience of balance, but it also talks

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,960
about the way balance has become a metaphor that pervades human thought. But different

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,800
metaphors have different values. Metaphors aren't all good. Some of them are really evil.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:29,280
They can be used to defend slavery, for example. So your question is, what kind of metaphor have

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,960
we got here? Is it one that's good or unclear or utterly bogus? Well, here, I think it's bogus

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,160
because he's trying to carry over from physics some sense of profundity from free energy.

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,160
But if you look what he means by that, as much or far as anyone's been able to figure it out,

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,080
and people like Anil Seth have tried to figure out what he meant by it, you say, well, it's just

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,480
another way of saying predictive processing. So I'm trying to say that what the brain is doing

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,640
is to make predictions about the future in order to figure out what's likely to happen and satisfy

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,280
its goals. So that's not a reasonable idea. It's a real hypothesis, and I think it's one of the

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:15,200
six things that brains do. But to elevate that into a free energy principle using a bogus physical

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,320
expression for physics, as I think is frankly illegitimate. It's not a good use of metaphor.

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,720
It's not a good use of analogy. It's a highly misleading term that is pseudo profundity.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,280
It's kind of like, actually, among the post-modernists you mentioned, I don't think

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Foucault is bogus. I think he's actually got a lot of insights into the way society works. But a lot

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,200
of the other people in that category, Derrida and often Cizek, they really just don't understand

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,080
the difference between obscurity and profundity. So that is, you should be able to figure out,

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,280
what are they saying? Is it true or is it false? And you can do that often with Foucault. You can

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,400
do that with good cognitive scientists. But the idea of free energy is just so kind of obscure

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,360
that it's hard to make sense of it. And I think actually the predictive processing idea is clear

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,480
enough that you can see that it's not true. Because as I said, the mind does a lot of other

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,520
things besides prediction. And it does it by means other than Bayesian processing. So predictive

37
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,880
processing is an idea that's interesting but wrong. Whereas free energy is an idea that's just

38
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:33,200
too obscure to be even wrong. I see, because as a layperson, my confusion always with the free

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,760
energy principle was I saw what Professor Friston was getting. And in fact, I'm currently reading

40
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,920
his book Active Inference. But as a meta theory, as like a theory of mind that encompasses what

41
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,840
the mind is, I always felt it lacked certain other parts of what the mind does. Like for instance,

42
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,640
coherence, explanatory coherence. And emotion for evaluation. And appraisal and communication

43
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,800
with others. You need all of these things. If you're going to have a full theory of mind,

44
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,440
it's really just got one tiny corner. It commits something that I've called Thaley's disease.

45
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Thaley's was really the first philosopher and the first scientist. Absolutely brilliant thinker.

46
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,560
But he came up with a theory that was just a little too simple. His theory is everything is

47
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,280
water. Well, that was brilliant. It's absolutely simple. But even by Aristotelian standards,

48
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,520
whether you also need earth, air, and fire, it just didn't cut it. And of course, now that we

49
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,360
know there's 118 different elements. No, it doesn't work. So what I call Thaley's disease is coming

50
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,080
up with a theory that looks brilliantly simple, but it's just way too simple. And that's definitely

51
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
true of predictive processing as well.
