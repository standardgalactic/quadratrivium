0	4840	everyone welcome to yet another episode of the inner realm podcast before we
4840	10960	start off some housekeeping points I apologize if I'm a bit sniffly and I
10960	15000	cough and I do all those things with my throat you know like scratch my throat
15000	20320	and all that unfortunately I've got a cold I just hope that I won't be too
20320	24960	irritable for you the listener and if it is too bad I'll edit the whole thing
24960	29760	out and make it a bit more palatable the second thing is I've got to admit I've
29760	36160	tried recording this episode four times already yeah I've spent four different
36160	40520	sessions on trying to get this episode right and I don't know why but I
40520	45160	simply seem to not be happy with it I simply seem to not be able to convey
45160	50000	the points that I'm trying to convey I think partially is because even when I
50000	54240	was writing the script for this episode I was a bit hesitant because you know
54240	61560	red pill, nanosphere, MGTO doubly, NOFAP, whatever these movements or
61560	68320	subcultures are they tend to be rather controversial and very very political
68320	74320	by nature and as a result of that of course I I'm not a fan of this kind of
74320	79760	casual dismissiveness of you know corporate media and anyone that does
79760	85400	talk about these communities critically I think they've been so maligned and
85400	91320	miscarriage that anyone who tries to even be a bit critical of these
91320	97880	communities end up getting out of slack or end up you know being called a
97880	103000	fraud or a liar or something like that simply because I feel like people that
103000	106640	are part of these communities who benefited a lot including myself by the
106640	112040	way have become very defensive of what these communities are so when I was
112040	115600	trying to record the episode every single time I felt like I said something
115600	119240	that I shouldn't have said I felt like I'm a spoke or I said something that was
119240	124120	untrue so I just you know adequately I didn't feel like I could publish that
124120	129480	episode so I kept trying again and again hey look let's hope I get it right this
129480	134680	time in any case before I start off because of the as I said the nature of
134680	139240	the podcast I do want to make oh I want to do want to stipulate the whole
139240	146040	episode with some caveats it's not only because of the point I made before but
146040	150440	also because this is probably the first podcast where I'm actually being critical
150440	155280	of a certain ideology and certain cultural movement I generally don't
155280	159040	tend to do that but this is the first time I'm actually I think breaking down
159040	162760	my qualms with a certain movement and my disagreements with a certain ideology
163120	168240	and fleshing it out on a podcast therefore I would say things that will
168240	172680	contradict my claims especially my critique of ideology ironically I think
172680	179480	I'm gonna critique ideology using ideology so if so facto at times I will be
179480	187760	an utter hypocrite I will also say adding on to that point I haven't given any of
187760	192360	these communities the time and research effort they deserve so I really do
192360	197120	apologize if I'm being casually cynical or dismissive of the ideologies I mean
197120	201240	it does take a lot of words to truly understand the essence of what these
201240	207480	cultural movements and subcultures are and in no way would I like my my intent
207480	212760	at least and and that's why I said I recorded this podcast five times already
212760	217800	for four times already this is the fifth time because I just didn't want to
217800	224080	misrepresent these movements the way the corporate media does so I hope at
224080	229640	least my intent in making this recording this episode comes across and I'll
229640	234120	definitely put in the intellectual and even experiential labor to try and
234120	237560	understand these groups and the individuals within these groups deeply
237560	243800	as a matter of fact I'm reading Rolo Rolo Tomasi's book The Rational Male now
243800	248400	you know according to his own Amazon page I think he calls let me actually
248400	254480	look it up according to his own Amazon page he calls himself the godfather of
254480	260040	the red pill and I feel like he's very influential amongst his red pill aiding
260040	266240	managed fair community helping men find women and get into relationships and all
266240	271960	that and look even his book there are some some good advice I think there were
271960	277640	some things that are it can be applicable to you know our lives and I also
277640	284040	wanted to sort of understand the broader view of how he views sexual dynamics and
284040	289400	relationships between men and women which is why I said that I'm much not
289400	293960	gonna just watch a few episodes on YouTube or watch a few go through a few
294000	298760	ready threads I'm actually gonna try and you know read the books that come
298760	305000	out of these communities because I feel like writing is the most pulled out most
305000	310800	precise and well detailed ports for you truly want to know a person well first
310800	316000	look at what they do but also read what they write over what they say because
316040	324640	what they write in some sense is more pulled out fleshed out ideas and it's
324640	328160	because of that I would say because of all these points I made that this will
328160	333120	definitely be my first episode on this topic of many to come because these
333120	339240	subcultures I hate it when you know corporate media maligns them saying
339240	342480	that there's some French far-right group or some silly thing like that because
342480	345960	they actually are quite influential I personally know a lot of people that
345960	351000	are that I've got great benefit from these communities and that would be
351000	358200	including myself which is why I firstly want to make a case in defense of
358200	363720	bro culture now we've got a delineate bro culture from the red pill communities
363720	369040	on the internet I think bro culture is a bit more broader whereas red pill is a
369040	375880	lot more political oh by the way I just want to add a point since obviously MGTO
375880	382000	W manasphere no fap it's all a mouthful as a umbrella term I'll just use the word
382000	389320	red pill community but I do think this whole bro culture and this idea of you
389320	396040	know masculinity what would it call it hyper masculinity maybe just connect a
396040	403440	lot with the red pill community it goes hand-in-hand in many ways I gotta say
403440	410840	as a young man when I was maybe 17 18 or probably even a bit younger and then
410840	417480	even into my early 20s like 1920 maybe even 21 bro culture was extremely
417480	422520	beneficial for me as a young person and the best to define what bro culture is
422520	429960	is through my anecdotal experience so bro culture is greatly connected to
430000	436760	sports and and yeah like the red hole the red hole red pill thing it's
436760	441840	interesting right because a lot of people that generally tend to be a part of
441840	447960	really embrace that bro doctor in the bro culture they probably would consider
447960	455480	themselves to be red-pilled or whatever and a good way to define bro culture is
455880	461880	actually by a speech by the Roosevelt the eponymous speech called the
461880	466160	strenuous life and I think it captures what bro culture is best in a more
466160	472520	refined gentlemanly manner and I quote a small part from the speech it says I
472520	478560	wish to preach not the doctrine of ignoble ease but the doctrine of the
478560	485080	strenuous life the life of toil and effort of labor and strike to preach that
485080	491120	highest form of success which comes not to the man who desires mere easy peace
491120	496240	but to the man who does not shrink from danger from hardship or from bitter
496240	503520	toil and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph so yes as I
503520	508120	said this is kind of the message of bro culture it's the whole pull yourself up
508120	513520	by your bootstraps message and as I I'm probably repeating myself now it's
513560	517800	deeply associated with sports it's this embrace of masculinity the good and the
517800	522080	bad keep in mind and it gives the message of self-reliance to nasty
522080	526920	discipline and I feel especially for young boys and young men this is a great
526920	532840	message you know leaving aside politics the whole you know picking up women
532840	538720	thing and the whole all the critiques that I come to their role I still
538720	544720	believe essentially these are good messages you know they they not just
544720	548560	for men but even for women telling someone to take responsibility for their
548560	554680	life it's something that we don't hear much in contemporary culture and I
554680	559440	would also say you know on the on the topic of strength and sort of self
559440	565240	improvement let's say a good good example is Elliot Hulse now undoubtedly
565240	572920	Elliot Hulse is a full-on bro he's like the quintessential bro and is also very
572920	576200	much in the whole redfoot community he's going through his own face he had the
576200	581240	whole mega thing now I used to watch a lot of Elliot Hulse's videos because I
581240	586560	was rather I would say enamored by strength I still am I I admire strength
586560	590840	and you know I really like strongman and I used to watch some some of his some
590840	596760	of his videos to you know to do strongman workouts and all that before I
596760	603600	stopped because suddenly I felt like he became this very zealous
603600	609080	Tradcon traditional conservative and you know he was like all he talks about is
609080	613680	like how women should submit to men and and he really kind of embodied that
613680	620040	whole traditional conservative I don't even know the Tradcon ethos into
620040	625280	himself and then it frankly it became as much I still like him I still think he
625280	629240	gives good advice like for example I'm gonna pick up a small clip from his
629240	635040	podcast here to you know exemplify what I mean but he's became this like a
635040	640120	knowing ideal of that constantly preached Tradcon values and and constantly
640120	644960	evangelized his way of living and prescribed his way of living onto the
644960	652560	world and I guess onto his videos in this case but despite all of that this is
652560	659480	an example of why I think this whole bro culture movement and the let's say the
659480	664000	what's the word not poorly is but the more influential people in this
664000	668920	movement do give a good message so this one's on the whole no fat movement and
668920	675440	which is also connected to all of this look I think the young people especially
675440	680280	young men have a massive problem with photography I've dealt with it I would
680280	685840	call it a behavioral addiction I think a lot of people are either ashamed to talk
685840	690240	about it or they trivialize it but as far as I'm concerned I know a lot of my
690240	696960	mates who sometimes ah it's like they if that isn't an addiction I don't know
696960	701280	what it is you know like they'll go hours sometimes you know indulging
701280	705480	themselves in porn consuming porn so it definitely is a problem it's definitely
705480	709080	something that has to be spoken of and for the longest time the only people
709080	713080	that spoke about porn addiction and this problem with internet pornography
713080	719440	were the red pill grows all the people in this you know no fat movement which
719440	723200	is connected to the bro culture they were the only people that actually spoke
723240	733080	about how this is probably a dangerous thing that it's probably affecting young
733080	738400	people in their cases focus more on men you know psychologically spiritually
738400	745280	but I found this particular video by Elliot to be a rather astute take because
745280	750880	he doesn't just say don't watch porn don't jerk off or he doesn't just say you
750880	754640	know don't don't be a loser that just sits sitting on jocks in front of a
754640	758560	computer all day and you know jerks off for women on the internet just jerks
758560	761800	off to women on the internet he actually makes a very very interesting
761800	766200	point and this is a bit bit of a longer video but I think what he's trying to say
766200	772040	is a good example of the kind of messages one could hear from the bro
772040	777080	culture movement and then how that could be greatly beneficial for young people
777360	785120	mostly for young people but for anyone really I've heard you yo Elliot I've
785120	791000	heard you say that men in their 20s should bust their nut once a week why
791000	796480	is this I think I'd like to retain for as much longer than one week thank you
796480	803240	I'm loving this program so first of all I have my conviction about it that comes
803480	807880	from what I've studied right again this is I'm not an expert in this but I've
807880	810600	often referred to this great little book called listen to your body and it's
810600	813840	based on traditional Chinese medicine and I do think that there's some value I
813840	818360	think there's tremendous value to Chinese medicine and natural health right
818360	822280	essentially it's natural health how to be healthy naturally without you know big
822280	828960	pharma and so there are ways to live that that improve longevity and vitality
829000	833960	and make you feel good right make you make you the best you and so according to
833960	838480	traditional Chinese medicine in this nice little cute little book he goes on
838480	841080	and says that there are clear guidelines and traditional Chinese medicine
841080	847400	about ejaculation of sperm so the the premise is that the more you blow your
847400	852720	load the more you're you're losing your vitality right and I think we've all
852720	856880	sort of experienced that right I know I've had right it took me until my 40s
856880	861000	I didn't realize it when I was younger a lot of you guys recognize it more for
861000	865160	whatever reason but not until my 40s I started to recognize it boy the day after
865160	871640	I blow my load and for like you know a day or two a little off and then I also
871640	875760	discovered takes me about 10 days personally at this point for me to feel
875760	880200	that vigor that fire that I've had before blowing my load and now it makes it
880200	885840	makes sense to me now after reading this pseudo scientific right I don't think
885840	888480	there's anything wrong with pseudoscience right in fact like the whole
888480	892560	vaccine thing is pseudoscience it's like not exactly science but they're
892560	899040	pointing at something there see what I mean for some reason
899040	905360	unfortunately because they get sucked into ideology suddenly everyone who's a
905360	911040	part of the Red Bull movement also have to be you know I would say I'm fairly
911080	915760	critical of vaccines and the whole movement or what whole whole thing that
915760	924640	happened during COVID in any case out of the video so anyway it says clear
924640	929640	guidelines about ejaculation of sperm in general not more than twice a month is
929640	933800	advised because of loss of vitality other consideration includes the men's
933800	939000	health and his age the ancient texts give the following advice for a man of 20
939000	945000	years old once in every four days just going based on that right at 30 once
945000	952200	every eight days at 40 once every 16 days at 50 once every 20 days and at 60
952200	959280	once a month so I come to the conclusion now this validates what was my
959280	962000	conclusion or they kind of work together I don't know if I had this thought
962000	964960	and then read it in the book or read the book and it helped me have thought but
965000	972960	I've sort of sort of brought this together in my own mind that's or based on my
972960	977680	experience as well this is I think this is a pretty solid guideline it doesn't
977680	981720	mean that it's written in stone but one of the things that I've discovered just
981720	986560	through my own experience but watching you guys and watching videos and
986560	991280	noticing this whole no fat we seem in retention movement there are a few things
991360	996400	that could be pathological about it and one of them is that it becomes starts to
996400	1001320	become a God it starts to become an obsession what I mean by that right in
1001320	1004280	the same way that masturbation becomes an obsession right because he's
1004280	1008640	engaging in that ritual and you're worshiping porn every day when you do
1008640	1014480	this there is a sense of pride I started to notice it when I was fasting right I
1014480	1018120	fasted before doing see you see me retention I fasted you know started
1018120	1023720	fasting back in 2018 I only started doing see more attention this year and so
1023720	1027960	I'm careful with myself because I saw what happened to me with fasting I started
1027960	1034360	to get proud I started to personally identify with my streaks you catch where
1034360	1039000	I'm going with this I started to make it a bigger deal than what it was and the
1039000	1045240	month the monks the the month the monastery the guys in the monasteries
1045240	1050200	right I think I remember reading this from Briana Shav also he talks about how
1050200	1058120	not to be too austere with yourself for fear of pride he says that Satan loves
1058120	1063360	it when you're really tough on yourself because then you start to become you know
1063360	1071800	hmm well I did no fat for 20 days I did 30 days I did 50 days all right so then
1071800	1075260	it starts to become a religion it starts to become an obsession it starts to
1075260	1080640	become an idol that's barely what it ends up becoming right or I fasted wow this
1080640	1085360	guy fasted for 10 days why he fasted for 20 days well I only fasted for five
1085360	1091240	days I gotta live up to these guys it starts to become an ego issue and I
1091240	1097320	don't and I wouldn't have been able to warn against this as it relates to see
1097360	1102280	intention had I not messed up during my first season of fasting now I don't take
1102280	1107400	myself too seriously with any of this stuff in other words I don't make it an
1107400	1111840	idol I don't have I'm not personally identified with it I don't get my sense
1111840	1117160	of value and self-worth from it so that's just that's one warning right that's
1117160	1120840	more of a that's more of a spiritual warning it's a warning against pride
1120840	1126080	that's all it is right start to feel like well look what I did and even that
1126120	1134600	just just just the whole idea that I am going to fast is sort of an idol it's
1134600	1142280	sort of a egotistical way of looking at it when the saints and the divines and
1142280	1146800	the mystics right I love the orthodox tradition they even call some of their
1146800	1158880	guys mystics they they they recognize that it is it's a it's a spiritual battle
1158880	1163840	that you're you're gearing up for it's not a matter of challenging your yourself
1163840	1170840	right it's and when it's a spiritual battle it's beyond your will and so I
1170840	1174760	can will myself to get something done and then I can be proud about it because
1174800	1182840	look at me or if it's a spiritual fast it's a spiritual retention or abstinence
1182840	1193000	right it's God is helping me God has given me grace to do this this is a
1193000	1199320	humble way of looking at life that saves us from pride but also saves us from
1199320	1203520	depression because if you start to think that it's up to me to get things done and
1203520	1209800	they don't get done you're gonna feel bad about yourself so both either way if we
1209800	1214760	if our if our will wins or loses we lose if your will wins you will you lose
1214760	1221600	because you become proud if your will loses you lose because you take that
1221600	1224800	personally as well it's like the opposite of pride but it's on the same
1224800	1229480	spectrum I don't even know what to call it right but like depression right
1229480	1234320	depression is is on the same spectrum of pride I don't that's the right word but
1234320	1240840	feeling sorry and sad about yourself is just as it's almost it's a it's a other
1240840	1246200	side of the same coin of feeling proud and good about yourself because they're
1246200	1253720	both wrapped up in what I can do what I didn't do as opposed to resting in the
1253720	1260920	Lord and saying and asking God to give me the grace I think that perspective is
1260920	1270200	good for us right again once again I don't know I know that there's spiritual
1270200	1274360	wisdom in the literature and the Bible and stuff like this right I know that
1274360	1280480	there are good ideas that were propounded by ascetics and such and then
1281240	1287520	then there are commandments things to do and not to do but in my life I've looked
1287520	1291640	at those things and I recognize them as maybe external like okay I get that I
1291640	1296280	see that I understand that but it's not until and maybe we gotta all make our
1296280	1302240	own mistakes is not until I've seen it in myself and others that I'm like oh this
1302240	1307800	is practical advice it's not just religious weird stuff right so you know
1307840	1312120	people are like oh that's all archaic religious thinking well it's actually
1312120	1318760	very practical right so it's very practical to lean on God lean on the
1318760	1322560	Creator lean on the Father lean on nature whatever you want to call it even
1322560	1328680	though nature is a fruit of God I want to be in walking with the Creator rather
1328680	1334040	than offering it up or recognizing that I am not 100% sovereign over my life but
1334040	1342920	the grace and mercy of God precedes me then you can't get depressed you can't
1342920	1346400	get depressed you can't get depressed because your life is in the hands of
1346400	1350600	the Lord and if he sees it fit for you to have this failure then it's up to you
1350600	1357480	to be grateful for and see the lining in the cloud the silver lining of the
1357480	1362960	cloud right every every every bad thing that happens to us it's because God is
1362960	1367720	allowing it to happen to us because we're supposed to make something of it
1367720	1371080	but if you think that you're in charge and something bad happens you start
1371080	1375000	going okay what did I do how do I fix this why why why me I screwed up I'm such
1375000	1380580	a bad person and the same thing on the other side right it's the same coin same
1380580	1385760	coin oh look what I did proud of me look at this I did it and you didn't
1386040	1392120	right it's the same shit same shit you gotta stop you gotta stop and so as just
1392120	1396440	a warning against that right I'm not saying that's gonna happen to you but
1396440	1403520	just as a warning I advise not to push ourselves that hard I know that doesn't
1403520	1407400	I know that sounds like a contradiction from you know promasculine Elliot that's
1407400	1413160	telling everybody to do hard stuff but having austerity having discipline being
1413160	1417360	committed to something is very different than being attached to something
1417360	1422520	making something an idol and and and being personally identified with it very
1422520	1428120	different things try your best in everything that you do but leave room
1428120	1437160	for God that's all it is I feel like this is like you know Elliot being the
1437160	1445200	as I said the quintessential example of what a you know the port leader in the
1445200	1452280	broke culture movement would be this is great this is great advice he speaks
1452280	1457840	about humility he speaks about he doesn't speak about mere like peace
1457840	1462160	unanimous weak humility but he speaks about genuine humility he speaks about
1462160	1467480	the dangers of pride and you know as our culture has become more and more secular
1467480	1472960	and more materialistic we don't really talk about those let's say higher human
1472960	1478160	virtues anymore and when I was younger before you know I understand Elliot was
1478160	1482880	kind of evangelizing he has become very religious but even before he became sort
1482880	1487440	of the track on bro he used to talk a lot about these things in the middle of
1487440	1491800	the strength cam strongman videos he would give really good life advice and
1491800	1497760	I wouldn't even go to his channel for life advice per se as like a teenager but
1497760	1502520	he'd you know slip it in somewhere and then I'm and I think to myself oh that's
1502520	1505520	actually that's a that's a gem right there that's quite interesting you know
1505520	1510280	when he's for example he spoke about how depression and pride or depression and
1510280	1515840	this sense of euphoria and and eternal happiness or whatever you may call it
1515840	1520360	it's the same side of the same is a is a different side of the same coin that's
1520360	1525240	a very very brilliant insight that that shows he's got a perspicuity a
1525240	1533040	perspicuity and which is why I think messages like this all these workshops
1533040	1537520	and and different seminars that they organize in these communities it
1537520	1542840	provides community it provides brotherhood and fatherhood you know we I
1542840	1548080	believe definitely are living in the midst of a loneliness pandemic a lot of
1548120	1552680	people I can speak you know through my personal anecdotes through personal
1552680	1558360	conversations conversations I've had and stuff I've read are lonely
1558360	1563760	unfortunately due to unfortunately modernity after industrialized
1563760	1571160	industrialization and you you know how how how how capitalism has
1571160	1575960	completely been so pernicious in our society and made people into cogs in
1575960	1581600	this massive machine it's alienated us and that has created a lot of loneliness
1581600	1589040	that along with you know traditional little traditional small-scale communities
1589040	1592440	that dying off and people are becoming more cosmopolitan and people are going
1592440	1597920	to cities these smaller communities that with the epicenters of meaning and
1597920	1603080	community with them dying off definitely a lot of people are feeling a lot more
1603080	1608720	alienated ironically even though we think we have connected and all of this
1608720	1613320	yearnings all of these yearnings that young men let me let me speak for young
1613320	1617680	men from over here to young men from over here have you know the yearning for
1617680	1622880	brotherhood the yearning for structure the yearning for a purpose the broculture
1622880	1626880	for those years yearnings at least it gave me a structure when I was a lot
1626880	1633600	younger and it really wasn't really comfortable in my own shoes let's say so
1633600	1638720	the reason I wanted to put that part in the podcast is I wanted to be genuine
1638720	1645240	and sincere and show that I'm not being casually dismissive I use that term a
1645240	1649800	lot these days casually dismissive of these movements and I'm actually they've
1649800	1653400	actually you know helped me a lot that they've benefited me a lot and I've
1653440	1660080	even been a part of these movements when I was younger which is why probably I have
1660080	1664960	more insight into how to criticize them because I understood how a certain
1664960	1671640	person in a red pill movement with pink now the first this first point is
1671640	1678480	generally the problem with subcultures not nothing particular specific to the
1678480	1684360	red pill grows it is that Internet subcultures they kind of become a bit
1684360	1689640	cultish for sure but they also inevitably go to the extreme and they're
1689640	1694720	inherently ideological like they cannot exist without being ideological because
1694720	1704080	they need a dogma they need a doctrine to attract people and then they need and
1704240	1709800	then that doctrine once it's got enough people it becomes a self-perpetuating
1709800	1715720	belief it becomes a self-sustaining belief the more people that join these
1715720	1720400	different communities I also believe and I can't get to this get into this in
1720400	1727840	this whole in this podcast because it's a it's a whole book but I also believe
1727920	1738120	that unlike religion ideology never tells a full story whereas religion I
1738120	1742680	believe gives the complete narrative most religious stories give the complete
1742680	1747960	narrative ideology tells only one part of the story I think it was Jordan Peterson
1747960	1752680	who really made this crystallized this in my mind when I heard him talk about
1752680	1757200	this but I thought that makes a lot of sense so of course I've used to what
1757200	1760120	ideology a lot I've said that I'm critical of these subcultures I've also
1760120	1764520	said that I'm critical of the fact that they are ideological plus I'm critical
1764520	1769000	of the ideology so many things I'm critical of but let's run understand
1769000	1775160	what ideology is now it's a difficult thing to defend you know ideology isn't
1775160	1780440	merely a set of principles or a set of beliefs that refuse to update itself it's
1780440	1787120	a lot more deeper than that it affects us the subject psychologically way way
1787120	1793120	more deeply than I thought until I was exposed to Slavo Gijek's work so
1793120	1799000	Slavo Gijek kind of talks about ideology in his film the perverts guide to
1799000	1805000	ideology and he describes ideology best I think here's a short clip
1805040	1810840	hey buddy you're gonna pay for that or what
1814280	1821040	look buddy I don't want no house today either pay for it or put it back
1821040	1829480	according to our common sense we think that ideology is something blurring
1829480	1837800	confusing our straight view ideology should be glasses which distort our
1837800	1845920	view and the critique of ideology should be the opposite like you take off the
1845920	1853240	glasses so that you can finally see the way things really are this precisely and
1853240	1859400	here the pessimism of the film of the leaf is well justified this precisely is
1859400	1864880	the ultimate illusion ideology is not simply in post on ourselves
1864880	1873080	ideologies our spontaneous relationship to our social world how we perceive its
1873080	1881720	meaning and so on and so on we in a way enjoy our ideology alright to step out
1881720	1888480	of ideology it hurts it's a painful experience you must force yourself to
1888480	1895240	do it this is rendered in a wonderful way with a further scene in the film
1895240	1903280	where John Nada tries to force his best friend John Armitage to also put the
1903280	1910040	glasses on I don't want to fight you I don't want to fight stop it no and it's
1910040	1916720	the weirdest scene in the film the fight takes eight nine minutes it may appear
1916720	1922440	irrational because why does this guy reject so violently to put the glasses
1922440	1929960	on it is as if he is well aware that spontaneously he lives in a lie that the
1929960	1936040	glasses will make him see the truth but that this truth can be painful can
1936040	1949400	shatter many of your illusions this is a paradox we have to accept the extreme
1949400	1957280	violence of liberation you must be forced to be free if you trust simply
1957280	1963120	your spontaneous sense of well-being or whatever you will never get free what
1963400	1971640	freedom hurt brilliantly put you know I I think it was only Zizek who really
1971640	1978800	made me understand how much ideology captivates or even possesses us and once
1978800	1985680	it does why so difficult for us to let go of it so in that sense I actually feel
1985680	1992960	a deep sense of empathy with ideologues because you know actually let me let me
1992960	1998840	read a few excerpts from this essay by Mac Mac Mac Manus on the philosophy of
1998840	2005600	Zizek he says the appeal of ideology is that it enables us to bring psychic
2005600	2011320	stability to a social and natural world that is chaotic and broken in and of
2011320	2017440	itself that's an important point a latter point is something I it took me a
2017440	2021520	bit of time to understand this of what Zizek is trying to convey according to
2021560	2027520	Zizek the essence of being it may be even a metaphysical ontological claim is
2027520	2035320	chaotic so what ideology does it is at as Matt specifies here it gives psychic
2035320	2040280	stability which is why once we are assessed by an ideology once we become
2040280	2043800	a let's say the red pill ideology or the feminist ideology or some some
2043800	2049400	political framework or some socio-political framework that takes hold of
2049440	2055040	us it fundamentally changes our psychology it fundamentally affects our
2055040	2059840	psyche and then we just don't want to let go of it because as Zizek says
2059840	2065400	freedom hurts because freedom really is the is the confrontation of this chaotic
2065400	2072480	nature of this chaotic essence of being and that's a scary thing and you know
2072480	2076480	going on with the essay oh by the way the essay is was on a road magazine it's
2076480	2081040	called the philosophy of Slavo Zizek I haven't read all of Zizek's books for
2081040	2085760	sure but I've read a lot read and listen to a lot of his lectures and I would say
2085760	2090160	this essay was quite apt and quite accurate as to what Zizek tries to
2090160	2095000	convey through his work another excerpt is ideology provides us with a way of
2095000	2100840	projecting psychic stability onto the world for instance it enables us to
2100840	2106440	simplify complex socio-political and natural processes into simple party
2106480	2112080	narratives once again the red pill bros would say all of the problems that men
2112080	2117760	have are because of feminist or because of modernity or because of you know
2117760	2124680	neoliberalism or blame it on some group blame it on the other and that is taking
2124680	2131200	a very complex socio-political change and a natural process of society evolving
2131200	2135320	and breaking it simply into partisan narratives or breaking it simply into
2135320	2139880	something a lot more tribal and that's the danger of ideology and this again
2139880	2144400	I'm still in some sense even though I'm connecting this to the red pill
2144400	2150440	movement I'm still making a very general point on how anyone is susceptible any
2150440	2154120	movement is susceptible to ideology including religion of course that's
2154120	2159960	when it becomes fundamentalism ideology simplifies the chaotic
2159960	2164480	incompleteness of society and nature and provides us with a firm sense of
2164480	2169960	identity and values there you go it's what's interesting is you know the
2169960	2174960	latter point there and provides us with the firm sense of identity and values so
2174960	2179440	you probably remember I said initially that you know in my part where I was
2179440	2184080	talking about in defense of bro culture how as a young person these red pill
2184080	2188960	movements gave me structure gave me a framework to view the world through and
2189280	2195800	and it took me a long time probably 21 22 and maybe even 23 took me about two to
2195800	2201440	three years to break out of it because breaking out of it for me it was a
2201440	2207520	daunting task it perturbed me it brought this sense of existential angst so
2207520	2212840	again then I man I really hope I don't sound super serious or patronizing when
2212840	2216920	I say this that's definitely not I'm not trying to say or look at me over here
2217000	2222120	free from ideology I've got over the red pill movement I've got over all these
2222120	2226600	different subcultures on the internet and I'm my own person and I'm so like
2227160	2231480	above them and pointing fingers at them I really hope I'm not doing that I'm
2231480	2235320	what I'm saying is I totally empathize with why we're attracted to these
2235320	2241960	movements and how their their doctrines assess us and you know when
2241960	2247800	Kedricat again was influenced sorry Zizek was again influenced by Kedricat and
2247800	2252520	you know when when Zizek talks about this how the the essence of the world is
2252520	2257800	is kind of broken and chaotic I think it comes a lot from absurdism you know of
2257800	2263240	course popularized by Kamu but Kamu too was influenced by Kedricat and I believe
2263240	2269320	Kedricat said this very famous paragraph of his in his book either or and I think
2269400	2273880	this is a very this is this is like typical Kedricat you know with the humor and with the
2273880	2284760	absurdity but it's also a a it's a it's a typical sentiment of kind of the existentialist it goes
2284760	2292680	something like this marry and you will regret it don't marry you will also regret it marry or
2292680	2298680	don't marry you will regret it either way laugh at the world's foolishness you will regret it
2299320	2305240	weep over it you will regret that too laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it you will
2305240	2311960	regret both believe a woman you will regret it believe her or not you will also regret it
2312680	2318280	hang yourself you will regret it do not hang yourself you will regret that too
2319000	2324280	hang yourself or don't hang yourself you'll regret it either way whether you hang yourself
2324280	2332120	or do not hang yourself. You will regret both. This gentleman is the essence of old philosophy.
2336520	2341480	There are some things that are just so true, that the only way to speak about them is through
2341480	2347240	humor, through fuzz. And I think that's what character God is doing here. And then of course,
2347240	2353400	another famous line from Camus, he says, man stands face to face with a rational,
2353400	2359560	he feels within him, he's longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born out of this
2359560	2364840	confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.
2367240	2375320	This is deeply true. We all look for psychic stability of some kind to cushion ourselves and
2375320	2381160	sometimes even extract ourselves from the absurd. And we have no choice. We need to confront the
2381160	2390600	absurd. So my biggest problem with ideology is, in some sense, ideology makes one a coward.
2391480	2398120	It tells one that, no, just be comfortable in your own little bubble in this little ideological
2398120	2404280	framework and do not confront the absurd, do not confront the chaotic nature of the world,
2404280	2410280	which takes courage. And I believe it's in that confrontation once, once soul matures and when
2410280	2415640	develops his character and builds those higher virtues that we so rarely speak about these days.
2417640	2423960	Now, I come to something maybe a bit more specific to the red pill movement. And maybe
2423960	2430840	actually, since I did speak about Rollo Tomasi a bit earlier in his whole manosphere and because
2430840	2435880	he even though he touches on politics, and especially he's very, very critical of feminism,
2436680	2443880	he also focuses a lot on gender dynamics and sexual dynamics and relationships and dating
2443880	2451160	between men and women. So in his book, The Rational Male, and I think this is the gist of
2451160	2456120	what I got when I was reading it, but I didn't just want to read it, even though I felt reading
2456120	2462760	is because important for this particular podcast episode. I also listened to some of his interviews
2462760	2470680	and a big problem with modern society. And this really angers me. It really annoys me is
2471480	2478840	we've completely lost ourselves in abstracting and categorizing at infinity. We truly stopped
2478840	2485800	looking as people as individuals and rather started looking at them as abstractions. And this has
2485800	2492920	got nothing to do with left, right. It's just, it's a cultural, it's a cultural zeitgeist shift.
2493640	2499320	You know, because we live in such a globalized world, we've begun to bureaucratize everything.
2499320	2505000	Everything is becoming rather Kafkaesque and the human individual in some sense is being negated,
2505000	2513960	as being made into non-being, let's say, because we've completely begun categorizing everything.
2513960	2518200	Men are this way. Women are this way. Black people are this way. White people are this way.
2518920	2525400	Ah, I don't want to keep going. Gay people are this way. LGBTQ folks are that way. It never stops.
2526360	2535240	And the more we do this, the more we demean and the more value we give to the individual souls,
2536200	2542680	the uniqueness, the idiosyncrasies of the individual, the nuances of being an individual,
2543400	2551800	we don't pay attention to that anymore. And that again, I do blame a lot for the death of religion.
2551800	2557400	I do think a lot of religions speak a lot about that kind of individual spirituality, individual
2557400	2563640	connection with the transcendent, with the divine, and with this kind of abstract categorizing that
2563640	2570280	rarely happens, seldom does that happen. So, as I said, we've stopped looking at the souls,
2570280	2574200	we've become categorized people, and it's also become kind of obsessive. You look at
2574200	2578520	psychologists that talk about the big five and talk about psychometricians, because
2578520	2583800	fairly, maybe that itself is its own ideology because it's easy. It's an easy way to make
2583800	2589080	sense of the world when we categorize things and put things in their place and give things order.
2591000	2598840	I only really started to understand this phenomenon when I read Dostoevsky, especially when I read
2598840	2605080	this part in the Brothers Karamazov, where I believe Father Zezema is speaking to this
2605880	2610920	young woman who says that she cannot, Father Zezema, by the way, is one of the
2610920	2616760	wiser sort of sage-like characters in Dostoevsky's novel, The Brothers Karamazov. So,
2617480	2625240	he's talking to this young woman who says she cannot love people, she cannot love humanity,
2625240	2628200	and then he responds with this beautiful paragraph he says,
2629400	2635320	it's just the same story as a doctor once told me, observe the elder. He was a man
2635320	2642760	getting on in years and undoubtedly clever. He spoke as frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter
2642760	2650840	jest. I love humanity, he said, but I wonder at myself, the more I love humanity in general,
2650840	2657800	the less I love men in particular. In my dreams, he said, I have come, I've often come to make,
2657800	2664200	to making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually have
2664200	2672360	face crucifixion if it had been soundly necessary. And yet I am incapable of living in the same room
2672360	2678760	with anyone for two days together, as I know by experience. As soon as anyone is near me,
2678760	2686520	his personality disturbs my self complacency and restricts my freedom. In 24 hours, I begin to hate
2686520	2693240	the best of men, one because he's too low over his dinner, another because he has a cold and
2693240	2700760	keeps on blowing his nose. That was probably me. I become hostile to people the moment they come
2700760	2707160	close to me, but it has always happened that the more I detest men individually, the more ardently
2707160	2716440	my love for humanity. What a, man, you gotta read Dostoevsky, man, like what a, what a brilliant
2716440	2724200	point, what an astute take on society. Many of these Internet subcultures are making the same
2724200	2730600	mistake that Father Zezima talks about. As I said, people like Rollo Tomasi, the more I listen to
2730600	2735960	him on what I hear is, you know, what's funny is he unknowingly does this, he'd even explicitly say,
2735960	2742360	I'm not generalizing, but then he'll go ahead and generalize. I remember he was having this
2742360	2747160	conversation with a, with another woman and they were kind of going at it. They were in deep
2747160	2754280	disagreement. And even when she shared something about her personal life, he instantly took what
2754280	2760760	the, what she said and tried to abstract it out and put her into some box. I didn't see him
2761400	2767000	truly paying attention to what her as a unique individual was saying, but he had to
2767560	2772200	really get the, get the gist of what she was saying and they put her in a box, you're this kind of
2772200	2777960	woman. And I think that's really unfortunate because, you know, whether, whether he disagreed
2777960	2782600	or agreed with her, it doesn't, it's not the case. It doesn't matter. It's paying attention to what
2782600	2788840	her as an individual was saying, which is, you know, to be fair, what the psychoanalyst discovered,
2788920	2795400	you know, the Freud's that you got to truly, truly listen to a person as to what they're saying.
2795400	2801080	Don't try and make assumptions. Don't try and pigeonhole them. Don't try and put them in boxes.
2801080	2808520	Just pay attention. So all of these subcultures, subcultures, they unknowingly categorize women,
2808520	2814280	men, and relationships to the extreme. And yes, this may be beneficial for some people,
2814280	2820200	but I think what that does is again, this is something, this is ineffable.
2821240	2823720	It truly is, this is ineffable human experience.
2825560	2831320	It can't even be spoken of. And I think we really feel it only when we pay attention.
2832360	2840920	When we do this kind of categorizing and generalizing, we lose that. It's a magical,
2840920	2846360	beautiful thing. It's a life sustaining thing. And I feel like a lot of us in modernity have lost
2846360	2854280	that. And to be fair, this is no different to what a radical feminist or someone in Antifa or
2854280	2858520	some other ideologue would do. This again is a problem with ideology. And which is why I think
2859080	2863880	even though one can take certain lessons from the Red Perk community, like the lesson that
2863880	2871000	Elliot gave about porn and NOFAP and all of that, one should never completely let the ideology
2871960	2880360	control one and become a mouthpiece for the ideology. And not to never be afraid to think
2880360	2885800	freely and think independently. It is the most important thing. It's having the courage
2886760	2891240	to confront the chaos of the world and to truly be an independent thinker. One should never forget
2891240	2898120	that. I would also say maybe this is a bit of an ancillary point, but I think it's connected.
2898840	2903800	As the book itself says, it's the rational male. All these books are called the rational male. So
2903800	2911960	Robo Tamasi deeply respects reason. And generally people who tend to be the rationalist types,
2911960	2918200	the Stephen Pinkers, people who hold reason to be the highest virtue, let's say, they tend to play
2918280	2924840	a lot in this abstract game, in this game of abstractions and conceptualization. So the Rolo,
2924840	2932280	in some sense, one can never win a debate with Rolo because he would say the moment, let's say we
2932280	2937800	make an experiential claim, not an axiomatic truth, maybe make an experiential claim from our own
2937800	2944600	subjective life, not some kind of sadistic or objective claim that just generally applies to
2944600	2949480	everyone, but rather a subjective claim. He'll say, you're being irrational. Therefore, you lose
2949480	2955640	the debate. So he's already set the axioms or he's already set the rules for a conversation
2956200	2961240	even before we get into a conversation. So there's no way, which is why Rolo Tamasi is
2961240	2967560	kind of the Ben Shapiro. So some of those guys, you rarely see them lose a debate because the
2967560	2972440	framework they view through is that of reason. And again, I'm not being critical of reason.
2972440	2978280	Reason is important. In some sense, I'm using reason in this podcast to flesh out my points and
2979000	2988200	lay out my criticisms. But reason isn't the only form of epistemology, let's say. It's not the only
2988200	2994760	way at truth. There are many ways. For me, in some sense, I probably value experiential truth more
2994760	3002440	than even reason-based truth. Because for me, in some sense, once experience is more palpable,
3002440	3009640	it's more real. It's what one truly feels. And I would say, to end off this segment,
3011880	3017640	the truth is, we're all deeply lonely. No one will truly ever understand us. We must accept this
3017640	3024360	verity that we are all deeply lonely. No one, not even once wife, once partner would truly know
3025640	3031000	what happens in one's mind, what experiences we have. So the loneliness itself is an
3032760	3037480	existential part of life. I think Paul Tillich talks about, in his phenomenology, he talks
3037480	3043320	about the concept of anxiety. And he talks about meaninglessness a lot. But meaninglessness is
3043320	3048760	one thing. But even, I think Paul Tillich also touches on the idea of us as being lonely, us as
3048760	3054680	being like an atom detached from being, this incongruence we feel between ourselves and the
3054680	3065400	world. And we must confront this is no other way. Ideology isn't going to rescue us, I put it that
3065400	3075880	way. And now, this may be, oh man, on the whole dating thing, I couldn't believe some of the messages
3076600	3084040	either explicitly or tacitly that these communities give out. I'm going to be honest,
3084040	3090520	it rather disgusted me. Some of the ways that they generalize women, and they say that women are
3090520	3098760	like this, women are this kind of men. And I rarely, rarely hear these groups talk about love,
3098840	3105960	various love in dating. I don't think I even hear the word love come out. Because essentially,
3105960	3111720	for me, that's what dating is about. I date for love, for monogamy, for marriage, for deep
3111720	3117960	commitment. And all these communities, you know, people, let's say from the man's sphere or the
3118520	3125960	red pill dating communities, make the whole relationship thing like a game. That it's just a
3126200	3131160	zero sum game where you got to one up each other and you got to win. You know, they'll use terms like
3131160	3138440	sexual marketplace or sexual market value, detrimental terms. They use terms like economically
3138440	3147800	attractive. And they'll completely commoditize individuals or women in this case. And you know,
3147800	3153000	that definitely is because of how pernicious I think capitalism has become. And in some sense,
3153000	3159240	this is what Zizek, you know, who's very, very critical of capitalism says. It's not that ideology
3159240	3167160	that the ideology of capitalism has just this detached system that just exists on its own.
3167160	3172920	It deeply affects us, the subjects who are involved in it. And as a result of that, which is why
3172920	3178920	even something like dating, which I believe should be undergirded by love, becomes a marketplace,
3178920	3185160	becomes an economical transaction. And the more I listen to, you know, even when I was reading the
3185160	3188680	book, you know, they talk about concepts like hypergamy. And I understand that a hypergamy
3188680	3195000	definitely has a lot of evidence for it. But still, the, they'll say some facts. So we, we,
3195000	3199240	we run into the, you know, it's all problem, they'll state some facts. This is how things are. And the
3199240	3209880	odd would be, the odd would be this sort of cajoled or this contrived idea of, of the ideological
3209880	3216200	presuppositions. And, you know, honestly, some of them make women look like these self-serving,
3217240	3223240	rapacious capitalists who only date men for, for pretty much for social status or money.
3224440	3228840	I would say, man, I really recommend this video by Olivia. I'm not going to play the whole thing
3228840	3235560	because it's 20 minutes. It's called Our Conception of Love is Messed Up. It's such a beautiful video.
3235560	3242360	I truly resonate with what Olivia says here. She's a great YouTuber. I'll leave a link to it down in
3242360	3247880	the description. I'd probably play it. And also Bell Hooks, President Peace Queen, say we need to shift
3247880	3251960	our perspective. Anyway, I'm not going to, I'm not going to play the whole thing because it's 25
3251960	3258840	minutes. And she talks about how a modern conception of love is all about how can I
3259640	3264040	better myself? How can I look better? How can I look more healthy, you know, so that I can
3264040	3269800	be more attractive to my partner? And she says, instead, why not treat love like an art? Why not
3269800	3275880	treat dating of how can I give myself to the other person? How can I fulfill the other person's needs?
3276440	3283640	And instead of saying, how can I better myself? How can I play this game? And then if the other
3283640	3289960	person has a bad day, if the other person doesn't reciprocate, reciprocate, then this person's not
3289960	3295640	for me. I don't love this person. Like love is, you know, in that sense, love is metaphysical. Love
3295640	3302440	isn't a mere transactional thing. And, you know, Olivia makes a good point that love has to be
3302440	3309720	detached from capitalist ideology. For me, I was talking a bit about absurdism before.
3310680	3316920	For me, essentially the antidote to absurdism and this sense of meaninglessness is love.
3316920	3321560	It's not just love in relationships and dating, of course, it's not just romantic love, but it's,
3321560	3327720	you know, love within family, you know, what's it called? Is it filial love? I forget, love within
3327720	3337000	friends, and even if possible, love for humanity as a whole, as a whole. And when we view this whole
3337000	3346440	thing as some zero sum game, it truly corrupts it, it attains it. And I would say this, and I really
3346440	3354040	want to make this point. Love is terrifying. It's beautiful than terrifying. I've fallen in love
3354040	3359080	twice in my life. The first time it was beautiful than terrifying. The second time it's beautiful
3359080	3365000	than terrifying. And in some sense, I had no, I had no, it wasn't up to my own volition. I had no
3365000	3371080	choice in falling in love, which is probably why they call it the fall. And, you know, the whole
3371080	3377560	red pig communities and the people like Rollo Tamasi make it look like pick some boxes and
3377560	3382520	completely plan it out. And then you'll find the perfect woman, the ideal woman that you
3382520	3388280	want to spend the rest of your life with. But that's not true. Life, life doesn't work like that.
3388280	3395320	You know, yeah, you could write a book, you could make some very smart, rationalistic arguments
3395320	3400120	and contrive them, you know, using some, using language, but in real life, and this is kind of
3400120	3407240	why I said, I spoke earlier about paying attention to one's subjective experience, one's deep,
3407240	3417880	personal being. Love is a risk. And, and, and I truly believe that there truly isn't any substance
3417880	3423240	to one's soul without risk and faith, which is why love takes courage for sure. But, but it also
3423240	3429320	takes a leap of faith. It's not a mere game or it's not a mere, it's not like a job interview
3429320	3433800	where you take some boxes and you work through some framework. It's, it's metaphysical, it's
3433800	3439720	spiritual, it's beyond that. And it's true that I think one truly becomes a complete person. It's
3439720	3444760	through that risk, through that character guardian leap of faith. And keep in mind character guard
3444760	3450600	never said, when you take the leap, the landing is soft. The landing can be terrible. Nevertheless,
3450600	3455960	one has to take the leap. And which is why it is not a, I'm not making a rational case here. You
3455960	3461960	might, everything I'm saying may, may sound like nonsense, but I guess I would say
3462280	3467880	don't even listen to what I'm saying, pay attention to what your heart's saying, pay attention to
3468760	3473400	where your heart's leading you. And that, that takes practice. It's not easy to be attentive,
3473400	3480360	attentive to oneself. You know, I would also say another thing about hypergamy and women's
3480360	3486600	liberation. So firstly, I want to play this clip by Djejec. He talks about marriage. I think it's
3486600	3495320	a beautiful, beautiful clip from a recent interview he did. And, you know, Djejec also influenced
3495320	3502360	me to get this view of love. So one thing the Red Pearl community, all the Red Pearl bros say is
3502360	3507800	that because, you know, women are liberated now, you know, women don't have to rely on men.
3508840	3515880	Let's say for financial needs, women can earn as much as men want to earn. They can have their
3515880	3521560	own careers. They can have their own life. And therefore this whole concept of hypergamy,
3522520	3528200	it's probably not, it's probably, well, hypergamy still exists, but it's not how it probably
3528200	3535320	traditionally existed where women relied on men as being the providers, as being the breadwinners
3535320	3542840	of a family, but rather men and women both have independence to fend for themselves.
3543080	3549960	And what Djejec says, which is fantastic, is that women's liberation has actually
3549960	3555160	has actually given way for genuine love. You know, and maybe this is a, there you go,
3555160	3559880	a good thing about capitalism because the free market has given that kind of freedom that
3561560	3567560	the liberation of the genders has given way for true genuine love where a man and woman can
3567560	3572040	be in a relationship, can get married if they truly love each other and for nothing else,
3572040	3578520	not for any financial benefit or not for any kind of, as I said, game in the sexual marketplace
3578520	3584680	or some game of hypergamy could truly be something metaphysical in that sense. And I want to make
3584680	3589160	this, play this clip by Djejec when he talks about marriage, which by the way for me
3590440	3596440	is the deepest manifestation of love. It's the most, maybe the highest thing one could do
3596440	3601240	symbolically to declare one's love. And here's what Djejec says.
3602200	3609000	I think that precisely because it no longer has this economic function. Marriage today
3609000	3615960	can be something beautiful. It's just a pure commitment. You say basically to society,
3615960	3622840	I care for this person more than for anybody else. I want to be, it's just for me,
3623480	3633400	it can survive marriage as a commitment to share a world with somebody. For me, okay, sex is beautiful,
3633400	3639960	passion at night, whatever. But as we all know, then when you awaken, no, there is a problem.
3639960	3647000	And here true love begins for me. You know, when you, it's not just we were all the night doing it,
3647000	3653800	but when you have to build patiently small daily rituals, daily life, who will clean the toilet?
3653800	3659720	Who will do this? Who will do that? All these wonderful small rituals. How do you prepare
3659720	3667880	breakfast? We go there. And that's for me the true miracle of marriage, this commitment of two.
3667880	3673480	That's why I also, maybe this will be disappointed to your readers. I don't believe in this fashionable
3673480	3677400	notion of polyamory. You know, oh, I can love more persons.
3677400	3682760	Any other relationship? I don't, I'm not a moralist. I don't care if people do it.
3683320	3691960	For me, but for me, there is still something absolutely exclusive about loving just one person.
3692520	3699240	Because, you know, because, how should I put it, when you have polyamory open relationships,
3699240	3706120	it's usually too pragmatic. It's, I have different needs. Let's say for intelligent talks or whatever,
3706120	3713320	I need you for intense sex. I need you for fun. I need you. That's not love for me. Love is not
3713320	3720680	about satisfying your needs. Love is kind of a more metaphysical even, absolute trust. Love is,
3720680	3726680	I cannot live without you. And I'm ready to change radically just to be with you. In this sense,
3727560	3735800	I would say, I don't know what will happen. Just let's not get rid of marriage because
3735800	3742840	precisely today in our crazy world of all this, you know, the ideology today is experiment with
3742840	3748920	yourself. This is typical American ideology. Don't get fix on something. Different partners,
3748920	3755720	different sexual orientations. Today, you are heterosexual, make some homosexual experiments,
3755720	3760760	make some group orgy experiments and so on and so on. I don't find this satisfying.
3762280	3769560	Man, I can't even put into words how deeply I resonate with what Gijek's saying. I, you know,
3769560	3774920	I've never been on dating apps. And again, I'm not critical of dating apps. I know a lot of people
3774920	3781880	who found great partners through dating apps. But the reason I never was on dating apps,
3781880	3786440	dating apps was because well, I was in a long term relationship for about two and a half years.
3786440	3792200	So I really need one. But other than that, even after I broke up with my ex-partner, I
3793240	3798440	pulled about it for a while. And then before I met my, you know, current, the current partner
3799960	3805000	during that period, interim period, let's say, I realized, I don't want to play that game where,
3805720	3810680	you know, as Gijek was saying, the game of experimentation, you know, I tried this woman,
3810680	3817320	I tried this woman, I tried this woman. It felt like, again, I was reducing women to just a mere
3817320	3826440	commodity and just a mere bunch of boxes or categories that I'm ticking off. And for me,
3826440	3834280	that's not what love is. For me, love is a risk. It's love is, it's a fall and love is painful.
3834280	3839560	But one, one must experience all of life as that, as that poem by
3841160	3848280	Eurelke goes, actually, let me pull it up the poem. I've got the poem, actually, I think I've got it on my,
3849720	3856920	I've got it saved up. Let's see. Oh, I don't want to show any of my, let me just switch the camera
3856920	3865000	because this is my personal notion. It's this poem called, Go to the Limits of Your Belonging by
3865000	3871720	Ren and Marie Eurelke. And there's one verse in the poem that goes, let everything happen to you,
3871720	3879080	beauty and terror, just keep going, no feeling is final, don't let yourself lose me. I love that
3879080	3884440	idea of let everything happen to you. And I think it's in love, everything happens to a person,
3885160	3892920	the good, the bad, the ugly. So in any case, my point being, all of these subcultures, as I've
3893560	3901240	said many times, not probably ad nauseam, have their utility. They really do. But the way to
3901240	3906120	truly utilize these subcultures, the Red Bull Movement, the Manisphere, even, you know, books like
3906120	3913320	this, like by Rolo Tamasi on dating and meeting them, which again, great advice, is by having a
3913320	3920360	sort of paradigm shift. And it's essentially a philosophical paradigm shift of looking, of how
3921240	3926840	we as individuals look at other individuals and other women. I'm just being specific to the
3926840	3932840	whole dating thing and how we look at other people as souls and how we experience love.
3934360	3940120	And I would even say this, you see, this whole podcast, I'm essentially giving a irrational
3940120	3946440	message because I'm telling to let people make mistakes. I'm telling let people even experience
3946440	3953240	misery by the mistakes they make without prescribing an ideology onto them. That's what I truly
3953240	3959480	believe. I think that's what truly develops the human soul and truly gives person the vast array
3959480	3964920	of the human experience. Because if not, we're perpetually going to be stuck. Not if not, we
3964920	3970760	actually are always perpetually stuck in a yes or problem. Yes, we have a bunch of facts,
3970760	3977320	but we derive the odd from it. That's the important part. How do we derive the odd from the yes?
3978360	3984680	And ideology will say easy, just view the odd or derive the odd through this framework and it's
3984680	3993160	done. It requires no risk. It requires no thinking. It requires no experience. But I think that leaves
3993160	4001000	a person empty and it makes one's life rather insipid to be frank. Thanks for listening.
