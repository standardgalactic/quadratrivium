0	6160	Hey, everyone. Welcome to this conversation that I had with Professor Iris Berent. It was a riveting,
6160	13680	engaging and fascinating conversation. We discussed some of her work in our blindness to human nature,
13680	19520	how that blindness is innate to human nature itself. We spoke about the twin principles of
19520	25360	essentialism and dualism, some amazing work she's done on how the kind of the beliefs that
25360	32800	us laypeople have. And I even managed to, in fact, ask her a lot more speculative questions,
32800	36480	which I really haven't heard her, you know, publicly at least discussed before,
37280	44000	on qualia and consciousness, and even psychoanalysis and our old mate Freud, and she gave her views
44000	49680	on those two. Of course, given I'm a neophyte, there were certain parts where I was in too familiar
49680	54880	with the specifics of her research. So forgive me if I didn't do a good job at engaging a bit more
54880	61600	with more of her specific points. Nonetheless, you could find most of her papers online on open
61600	67840	journals. And, well, firstly, a bit of a formal introduction, let's say. Professor Iris Berent
67840	72720	is a cognitive psychologist at North Eastern University. She's the author of The Phonological
72720	79840	Mind and the Blind Storyteller, which we discuss rather extensively on the podcast. Her research
79840	86080	seeks to unveil human nature and our intuitive understanding of it to shed light on human nature.
86080	91360	She explores the human capacity for language using phonology as a case study.
92000	96880	Saying all that, without further ado, here's my conversation with Professor Iris Berent.
96880	102080	Firstly, if you don't mind a bit of a personal question, if I'm not mistaken, I believe you
102080	109760	initially studied miscology and then you sort of transitioned into studying psychology and
109760	115440	currently your research is more in specifically cognitive psychology. So perhaps you could just
116640	121600	kind of give us give us a few ideas on as to what you find interesting in this field
121600	125120	and what made you want to do research in cognitive psychology.
125120	134560	So my background is very varied, but to me, it's all a single story that's completely coherent,
134560	138720	because I think, you know, it's interesting how you look at your life history and you
138720	145360	discovered that in retrospect, it was all the same thing. It was all really interesting human
145360	153280	nature. It's really this question of why we know the way we do are the things that we are bound
153840	158960	to think about, to entertain, are there certain truths we are bound to hold,
158960	163520	just by virtue of the fact that we have, you know, a human genome, basically.
164240	171360	And that always really, really kind of bugged me. I think it came primarily from reading
171360	176400	Chomsky very early on when I was really young and it kind of stayed with me for many years.
176480	182240	And at first, this was a question that I explored with respect to music. So
184000	191440	there the question was, are there some structural properties that are common to all
191440	199360	musics, if you will, that we are born with and make us perceive music in a certain way?
200000	206160	And that was super difficult at the time. So we gradually transitioned into
206880	214000	easier question about language and finally kind of remain more in the domain of human nature
214000	220240	and itself in the sense of, can we understand our own human nature? And that's where I am right now.
221200	226480	Excellent. Yeah. I mean, before I jump into your book, of course, I kind of want to
226480	231440	ask a few more general questions. And so you said that it was, well,
232160	237120	initially human nature or understanding human nature, but also reading Chomsky,
237760	241920	which is clear from reading your work. I don't want to call you a Chomsky and that's
241920	245280	like a crass fear of putting it, but it seems like you're settling more on, let's say,
246960	253760	Chomsky side over someone like B.F. Skinner. And so if you don't mind, I would love for you to sort
253760	262880	of elucidate this ongoing, I don't want to call it a war, but debate between the Skinner side
262880	268320	and Chomsky side. And in fact, in one podcast, you even said that this debate is still ongoing.
268320	276160	It's not like it's done. Yeah, very much so. Nothing changes. Yeah, there's not a conclusion.
276160	279840	This is the answer sort of thing, which is what's lovely about science in my view.
280800	286800	So what's this debate in linguistics and cognitive science between Chomsky and Skinner?
287520	295920	So that debate at the time was how to explain behavior and generally in linguistic behavior
295920	304960	in particular. And Skinner was hoping to explain that in terms of properties of the information
304960	314480	that's available to us, what's out there in the environment and responses and the links
314480	320560	between them and associations that we formed between them. And basically the idea is that
321520	328960	to explain how we behave, which is all he cared about, all we need to do is look at the properties
328960	336160	of what's out there rather than what the organism brings internally to that, how the organism views
336160	344720	the stimulus and how the organism chooses to response. And what Chomsky made very clear is that
344720	349840	the study of behavior ought to start with the study of the organism. It's really kind of,
349840	356320	maybe you can think about it as a form of biology, thinking about what is it that the organism brings
357280	369120	with themselves to this task. So to make it very concrete. So why is it that you understand
369120	376800	the sentence? How is it that you have a sentence such as John is eager to please? How do you know
376800	391680	that it's John who is being pleased whereas if John is easy to please, then sorry, put it the other way
391680	399600	around. So if John is easy to please, it is the one who is being pleased is John, whereas if John is
399600	407440	eager to please, then he is pleasing Bill or somebody else. And what Chomsky made clear is that
408320	414960	interpretations such like that the only way to make sense of them is to figure out what is it that
414960	421680	the person knows about language and how they encode information that's available to them.
423280	429200	Any pointed out that our ability to do so to encode information that's available to us
429200	436560	is constrained in part by innate principles of language that he called Universal Grammar.
437440	443200	And would you say that's sort of something like innate knowledge that you write about in this
443200	450960	book? Yeah. So as I read Chomsky, this is primarily a treatise on human nature and about innate
450960	456240	knowledge which he happened to advance in the domain of language, but I always read him as a
456240	463760	philosopher essentially. Certainly. Yeah. I mean, he in fact, I believe he was the, he chaired the
463760	468880	Department of Philosophy at MIT probably for a long time. So he has a really good background
468880	477280	in philosophy certainly. Also professor, so with the idea of Universal Grammar, I've always been
477280	485120	thinking about that idea like is Universal Grammar itself this type of innate knowledge and is it
485120	493840	something that we can sort of study analytically? And empirically. Empirically. Beautiful. And I
493840	499840	would say experimentally. Yeah. So all you need is to start with a good theory of what you think
499840	506560	Universal Grammar is all about and then go to the lab and try to figure out do you have evidence for
506560	513440	this thing and it's not easy, but it's doable. I see. So if you could play a bit of devil's
513440	518560	advocate, because I've read, in fact, apart from Chomsky's political work, of course, I've read
518560	523680	his book On Language, which was an excellent read and I found it quite hard to read as a Neo5,
523680	530720	to be totally honest. But I do know there are certain people still in the field, as you said,
530720	538160	it's an ongoing debate that kind of are either critical or disagree with some of Chomsky's ideas,
538720	545840	or let's say values of Universal Grammar. So what are what are the current criticisms of this idea
545840	551440	of innate knowledge or Universal Grammar? So to make it clear, I think that in fact, the majority
551440	559200	of the field no longer thinks that no longer sides with Chomsky. I'm not totally convinced in my
559200	570000	reading of the evidence that that's right and that's the right conclusion. The debates as I see
570000	581200	it in the domain of language have always structured or have always centered on two issues. One is,
581200	586400	what is the machinery that you need to represent language? So what kind of representations that
586480	593440	you have? And what and what and do they are they structured? Are they structured in a systematic
593440	601280	way? Do you need something that is akin to algebraic rules? Or all you have is basically
601280	607920	associations, very rich set of associations, which apparently this is what GPT is doing,
607920	613200	you know, AI is doing today. So A is what kind of representations do you have? And do you need
613200	624720	explicit structure in your data, so to speak? The second question is where these representations
624720	630080	and the rules, the way you operate over these representations, where is all this machinery
630080	636720	coming from? And is it in part specific to language? So are you born with some principles
636720	642080	that are unique to language? And that's what allows you to acquire language? Or are you relying
642080	650880	entirely on generic mechanisms that operate across domains? So what is your machinery and
651680	658320	how specific it is, where and where it's coming from? These are have always been the questions.
661760	671840	And the debate these days are centered on a whether there are in fact algebraic rules. So this
671920	678400	is huge debate about that, which has been increased and confounded by the rise of AI because
678960	684800	proponents of that state like, look, you have the systems that seem to do just fine. And
686640	693040	it's not clear, but some people, there is a question of whether they in fact have any
693040	698880	algebraic representations at all. And the range of possibilities range between those who say
699680	706160	there aren't any structured representations in there at all, or that maybe they start without them
706160	712720	and they grow them somehow. And all this becomes really difficult to tell just because there is
712720	718560	so much data that these systems are exposed to that it's really hard. So one of the tests that
718560	723200	you know, how do you know that there is an algebraic rules? One of the way to test it is to look at
723920	729360	generalizations. Can you generalize to items that are not similar to anything that you've seen
729360	737360	before? But if you basically your data set includes everything that we have, then it becomes very
737360	741920	difficult to know whether you'd in fact generalize or not. So that makes the whole question of
742800	750560	machinery very difficult to decide. Questions of innateness are difficult to decide
751520	760880	for two reasons. A, the success of AI that kind of presents a big challenge. The other reason is
762240	768080	often time when you point out that there are universals across languages. So and this is one
768080	775680	of the main argument or an important argument to foreign aidness is to argue that, hey, we look at
775680	781440	language of other language and they all show a certain property. So in my work, we looked at
781440	789600	syllable structure and the fact that languages prefer structures such as blog to structures such as
789600	798480	all bog, L, B, O, G. That seems very clear. But the thing about this as well as many other
798480	805840	preferences is that there is a correlation between what languages like to do and what the
805840	812880	functional pressures of our body dictate. So if I ask my undergraduates why blog, then everybody
812880	821920	tells me that. What to say. And then intuitive theory behind it is that it's those functional
821920	827680	pressures, meaning how is it is for you to say that the constraints are you,
827680	835680	articulatory system and an addition that they are driving the force. In every area of language
835680	843200	universal, in many areas of linguistic universals, you find such correspondences between what languages
843200	849840	like to do and some functional explanation. Phonology is probably the area where you see those things
849840	856240	most clearly, but nowadays people are exploring those ideas elsewhere as well. And the problem is
856240	865200	that when people find those correlations, they assume causation, meaning they, if you find any
865200	872800	functional explanation of what's going on, people kind of jump to the conclusion that it's this
872800	879760	functional cause or functional factor that is causing the structure that you see. So in this
879760	885840	specific case, why do you prefer a blog? Because it's easy to say or because it's easy to hear.
885840	893920	That's what my undergraduates think. And so do professional scientists. And to me, it's not a
893920	901520	done deal. To me, this is an empirical question that you need to go and explore as indeed we have
901520	908640	and there are ways to do so. So the fact that you find correlation in principle is ambiguous
908640	915200	between two explanations. One is it's not language, it's not your G, it's the functional system,
915840	921920	the sensory and motor systems that are driving the cart here. That's what makes language the way it is.
923040	931280	But the alternative possibility is, well, maybe it is abstract linguistic principles that
931440	938720	are doing the driving, except for those principles are not entirely crazy. They're not entirely
938720	946640	arbitrary, rather they have evolved so that they optimize those sensory and motor pressures,
946640	952720	which I don't think is super surprising. So that predicts that, yes, you will find some correlation
952720	961200	between putative UG and those sensory and motor pressures, but what's doing the pushing was
961200	967680	doing what's pushing the cart, so to speak, is UG rather than sensory motor system. And merely
967680	973680	showing a correlation doesn't adjudicate between these possibilities. So in my work, we took it
973680	979680	very seriously. So for example, to figure out whether it's blog that's doing, I'm sorry, whether the
979680	985120	preference for blog is coming from, it's easier for you to say than in collaboration with my
985120	991040	colleague Alvaro Pascualeone, who is a neuroscientist who does transcarnal magnetic stimulation,
991040	998080	what we did is zapped the motor system that controls the articulators, the leaps specifically,
998080	1003680	and looked at what this is doing to your linguistic preferences. And conversely,
1003680	1008400	what happens when you zap Broca's area? And what we found is a dissociation between them.
1009040	1015680	So the point is, these are questions that you need to explore. You may or may not like the
1015680	1023520	evidence that we produced. I think they're clear, but my point is not to defend the solution, but
1023520	1030400	rather to defend the method. I am very concerned about that time to jump from correlations to
1030400	1035680	causation. I think this needs to be sorted out. And I think it's this disagreement that is behind
1035680	1043360	a lot of the ambiguity that we're having in the field right now. I did in fact read a blog post
1043360	1049680	written on your work from your lab by Northeastern University. And so correct me if I'm wrong, in
1049680	1057760	like a very elementary level, if I could put it this way, is it that you're at the moment claiming
1057760	1064880	that it's as if these UG or these abstract principles, they aren't physical, they aren't
1064880	1071200	arbitrary and random, but they've kind of evolved to suit our existence as home sapiens,
1071200	1077760	the same way let's say a physical limb or something has evolved. Exactly. Yeah, that's the working
1077760	1085920	hypothesis. But again, I think for me, it's more important to tell people that just showing a
1086000	1094080	correlation isn't necessarily proof. It's not a smoking gun of causation. It's more important for
1094080	1101040	me to emphasize this methodological claim than to push my own interpretation of the data. So I
1101040	1107920	think that there is probably a lot that need to be done, many more controls and to completely look
1107920	1113040	at this question. And we have contributed some, but by no means I would argue that we completely
1113040	1119440	resolved the issue. What really bothers me is that the attempt to view the correlation and to jump
1119440	1123760	to the conclusion that, oh, we know what's going on. I think that's really unfortunate.
1124720	1130960	I see, as any honorable scientist would say, we need more empiricism, more testing, more
1130960	1138240	experimentation. Love it. In fact, Professor, maybe this kind of opens the way for us to jump
1138240	1143760	into a question that I've been fascinated by pretty much all my life and kind of obsessed with.
1143760	1147920	I'm so glad you mentioned this in your book. So if you don't mind, I'm just going to jump
1148560	1155280	to your book at once here. And this is this question on abstract knowledge and embodied
1155280	1162560	cognition. And I love the part in your book. So if you don't mind me just reading out a small
1162560	1170400	excerpt in page 138 you state in chapter nine that abstraction and embodiment are not mutually
1170400	1178800	exclusive. Cognition could well encompass multiple distinct mechanisms that run according to different
1178800	1185840	computational principles. The conclusion that one mechanism exists does not automatically preclude
1185840	1194080	the other. Again, as I said, I loved what you wrote on this. So this also seems like one of those
1194080	1199600	ongoing quote unquote wars in the world of cognitive psychology. If you don't mind, please
1200240	1205520	elucidating and educating us on why you believe that they don't have to be mutually exclusive.
1205520	1212160	They're not at conflict with each other between abstract knowledge and embodied cognition and
1212560	1219120	what's your current working thesis on these two ideas? So I think why they don't have to be mutually
1219120	1225840	exclusive is pretty simple. Logically, maybe we should start by talking about what should we
1225840	1238880	clarify what they each mean. Yes, that would be great. So the notion, the so-called classical
1238880	1243280	view of cognition, which more precisely is known as the computational theory of mind,
1244160	1250960	assume that what's doing the causal work in cognition is algebraic representation that
1250960	1258160	are structured. So there are symbols and the symbols have form and structure of these symbols that
1260240	1267760	drive mental computations. So for example, if you know that I have a big ball, you know that I have
1267760	1273200	a ball and that's a property of human cognition. Every time I say I have a big ball, it implies that
1273200	1282160	I have a ball. The goal of cognitive science in this view was to explain what is it about the
1282160	1289840	structure of, what is it about the structure of my representation that not only enables that,
1289840	1295840	but in fact require that each time you think about a big ball, you imply a ball.
1296560	1303840	And they said, well, you have these complex symbols. Every time you represent the big ball,
1303840	1312400	it's not like a whole complex, it's not an analyzed item for big ball, but rather it has
1314400	1318960	formal components that correspond to the semantic components. So there's going to be
1318960	1325360	a representation of your brain that for the ball and for the big, and therefore if you have big
1325360	1335840	ball, it literally implies ball as well because the interpretation of the complex symbol depends
1335840	1341760	on its part. So that's kind of the computational theory of mind. It's the view of language basically
1341760	1349360	as literally a mechanical system that works on those symbols. And since the symbols have
1350160	1355920	structure, formal structure, and they have certain meaning, it follows that if you know
1357440	1364320	the A component of A and B, you must know, if you know A, B, you must know A, for instance.
1365920	1371440	So all this has to do with the structure for having these abstract symbols and mental representations.
1371440	1382720	Now, embedded cognition rejects this for the most part. So why is it that your encoding
1382720	1388400	of concept is not based on this algebraic discrete symbols with this combinatorial structure,
1388400	1400640	but rather by all my experiences with events in the world. So why is it that this ball,
1400640	1407040	this, you know, battle is blue? What is my concept of a battle? Well, I don't have any
1407040	1413840	abstract symbol in my brain. It's how this battle feels. It's how it's how cold it is and how
1413840	1420560	shiny it is and how round it is in my hand. And if I didn't have a hand, I would not have the same
1420560	1427280	concept of the battle because my physical interaction with the battle forms part of what I
1427360	1433760	understand as a battle. So this is the notion of embedded cognition. It's really
1434480	1440240	embodiment. It's the interaction of my body below my brain with the world that
1441680	1448240	dictates my understanding of it. In principle, you could have both, right? You can have a rich
1448240	1455360	sense of sensory-motor interactions and symbolic machinery. And, you know, you can encode them in
1455360	1462480	both and encode the world in both ways. But proponents, many proponents of embedded cognition
1462480	1469520	take the strong position that not only you have it, but you only have it. So you don't need,
1469520	1475200	so all this business of structured representations, the computational theory of mine is completely
1475200	1480960	baloney. You don't need it. You can explain everything in terms of these sensory-motor
1480960	1486960	interactions. And when stated in this way, I think this is an empirical claim that, again,
1486960	1493760	you can test. So as we said before, if your understanding of phonology was entirely dependent
1493760	1499360	on the motor system, then breaking the motor system, disrupting it, say by TMS, or to have
1499360	1505440	disrupted your understanding of language. And it doesn't look like it's the case. Only it doesn't
1506000	1511280	completely eliminate your understanding of phonology, which is an area that should be
1511840	1517600	very strongly dependent on the motor system. So I'm not arguing against the motor theory.
1517600	1524640	And in fact, there are certainly other aspects, low-level aspects of speech perception,
1525360	1531120	such as how do you tell Bach from Pa, where there's very strong evidence that you rely on
1531760	1535280	embodiment. So I think I jump to this notion of motor simulation.
1535840	1544400	Part of what this embodied cognition theory is saying is that not only what you know consists
1544400	1549760	of these sensory and motor interactions, but in order for you to conceive of a notion,
1550400	1558480	you need to simulate what it would be for you to act on this in a particular way. So for me to
1558480	1564560	think of battle, I need to simulate what it would be for me from my hand to grab the battle and how
1564560	1573600	it would feel and so forth. And this is an empirical claim. So you can see whether, so as I started
1573600	1579680	saying, sorry, at the low levels of cognition, there is evidence that indeed such simulations
1579680	1586400	take place. So what we have found and many other people have found is that when you hear the sound
1586400	1593600	Ba, you enact the lip motor area of the brain that control the lips. And therefore, if you're going
1593600	1601120	to disrupt it, you're going to selectively impair your ability to say, perceive the sound Ba and not
1601120	1608880	the sound Ta, which involves the tongue. So evidence like that suggests that, yes, there is
1608880	1616000	embodiment and there is motor simulation just as this view predicts. So the view is not incorrect
1616080	1622800	categorically. What seems to me incorrect is the strong claim that this is sufficient to get
1622800	1633520	language off the ground at all levels. And then if we, so how then, how do you propose then that
1633520	1638640	these, both of these can kind of, let's say, you said, yes, logically, they could coexist.
1639440	1647440	But what would be an example when you say that embodied cognition on its own can't explain how
1647440	1654240	languages form? So the example that I gave you came from this case of syllable structure. So
1654880	1661680	we asked, why do you prefer a blog to a blog across languages, which does seem to be the case.
1662880	1667120	In fact, it's not just these two structures. There is a whole hierarchy there that certain
1667120	1672080	syllables are better than others and those are better than others and so forth. So it's a complex
1673680	1679120	hierarchy there. And the question is, is it that because the good guys are easy to say,
1679120	1686880	and the bad guys are hard to say. And embodied cognition predicts that that should matter even
1686880	1695200	if the task at hand is just to listen. So even if all I'm asking you is listen to blah, tell me if
1695280	1702880	it has one syllable or two. You're not supposed to say anything. And yet, according to embodied
1702880	1710320	cognition, for you to just hear it, you need to simulate what it would be for you to say it.
1711280	1716320	So if this thing is presumably easy to say, you should be accurate. If it's hard to say,
1716320	1723840	it's you should be less accurate. But critically, this ability to say, to literally control the
1724480	1732080	motor program of, in this case, you lips is going to be causal, play a causal role in your ability
1732080	1738320	to perceive it such that if you can do that, if you can move your lips, you should not be able
1738320	1745840	to perceive it properly, to hear it properly. So perceiving depend on acting, perceiving
1746320	1756080	and perception and action are intimately linked together. And that predicts that if we would not
1756080	1765120	enable you, if we disable the motor system, then perception of language structure ought to be
1765120	1771920	impaired. So if language structure is all about this simulation and how easy it is to compute,
1771920	1775280	then if there's no simulation, you shouldn't care about language structure. You should know
1776800	1782080	no evidence that you are sensitive to that. And that's not at all what we found.
1783680	1789760	I see. And that's where you would say, okay, there's some kind of, let's call it UG or abstract
1789760	1798640	knowledge that does still allow us to. So abstraction and UG are not synonyms. From this,
1798720	1805840	all you can conclude is whatever you know is not just the result of motor simulation,
1805840	1810080	whether or not it's universal is a separate question that we have explored elsewhere.
1810720	1817040	But it tells you something about the role of abstraction, which is further strengthened
1817040	1825120	by the fact that in the second paper in this series that came last fall, if I remember,
1826080	1832160	what we did is simultaneously in the same participants looked at both how they respond to,
1832160	1840240	how they identify simple sounds like bah versus bah, so very low level properties versus how they
1840240	1847200	look at syllable structure. And what we found is, yes, the lip motor area, this motor simulation
1847200	1854160	business certainly plays a role in low level perception just everybody else thought. It's
1854240	1859840	specifically in the syllable hierarchy that we didn't find in language structure, namely,
1859840	1866160	that we didn't find a role. So that's the selectivity really suggests to us, whereas
1866160	1871760	rockers area did play a role. So this double dissociation as it's called technically suggests
1871760	1878880	to us that you might need both. Excellent. Yeah, you truly are a bona fide scientist,
1878880	1884320	Professor, because I tried to jump across and kind of conclude that the your experiment on
1884320	1889760	embodied cognition probably means we kind of, we need abstract knowledge too, but then you claim
1889760	1896560	that no, no, what that really says is that it falsifies the theory that all we need is abstract,
1896560	1902880	sorry, embodied cognition. So I'm glad he clarified that. So just to clarify again,
1902880	1909280	what they the experiments show is that you need abstraction, they don't necessarily show you
1909280	1915440	need the neediness. I see, I see. I understood. Yeah. Okay, so again, I'm going to jump back to
1915440	1920000	like a vague more and more like a naive question. Clearly, you probably can see that I'm still a
1920000	1927360	neophyte. I'm still getting my hang around this field. But great question so far. Oh, thank you
1927360	1935200	very much. I appreciate it. But I guess this is, I don't even know whether this is an unfair
1935200	1939920	question to ask, because this is pretty much a question we've been trying to answer since
1940640	1945120	time immemorial really. What is unique about human language?
1948800	1955120	We don't know for sure. Again, like everything else, it's an empirical question, but we have some
1955120	1963360	clues. So people so so I think we need to distinguish between two questions.
1964560	1970000	Is this a definition to the notion of natural language? So is natural language
1971360	1977200	a kind in the sense that there is something that defines all languages? So English and French and
1977200	1983600	Swahili and Mandarin, is there something that's common to all of them? And the second is, is it
1983680	1989120	unique to them? So is it only defining these languages and not other systems?
1990240	1997360	Right, so that there are different questions at hand. You can look for those characteristics at
1997360	2005200	two levels. One is to ask, are there some, as the linguist Charles Hockett said, are there some
2005200	2014960	design principles that are shared across all languages? And you can then look at more intricate
2014960	2019360	aspects of language structure. And that's really what Universal Grammar is asking. This is really
2019360	2024560	a question of, is there something that defines human languages as such, because they're all
2024560	2029920	molded by the same cookie cutter, so to speak, but the same by Universal Grammar.
2030320	2038720	We talked about Universal Grammar, and I see some evidence for the possibility that maybe it plays
2038720	2045680	a role, although, as we had discussed, this is only open to discussion and debate in the field.
2046560	2054640	With respect to design properties, so the linguist Hockett came with all these design
2054960	2062960	principles of language, and the fact that all languages have meaning, and they talk about
2062960	2067440	things that are not here and now, and so forth, but many of those things are also shared with other
2067440	2074080	systems of non-human animals, for instance. There is one component, though, that seems to be
2074080	2082160	one design principle that seems to be unique to language, and that is this notion that is called
2083120	2093920	duality of patterning, and that is, so it's kind of the double helix of language, so to speak,
2093920	2100080	in the sense that language has patterns, so the whole point about language is that it's not just,
2100080	2106880	you don't just memorize and analyze whole, but rather there are patterns with structure,
2107760	2113760	but those patterns exist in two levels. The one level that everybody is aware of is syntax,
2113760	2119680	so if I say the dog, you know, dogs bite men, or men bite dogs, it gets you completely different
2119680	2127040	meaning, which means that, in this case, the syntactic organization matters, and if you change it,
2127040	2135120	you change meaning. So that is this area in which you take, to simplify, you take words,
2135120	2139840	which have meaning, and how you order them, how you pattern them makes a difference.
2142240	2152240	This is one level, but there is a second level, which is every such word is not an atom, but rather
2152240	2162000	it's a molecule that is further constructed from meaningless elements, so if I say dog,
2162080	2169680	you get the dog, one combination of those sounds, you get one meaning, if I say dog, you get a
2169680	2175200	different, completely different meaning, right? So the ordering, there is pattern, that's the
2175200	2180640	fact that when you change the ordering, you change the significance of this, of the sequence, means
2180640	2186320	that the patterning matters, but this is not a pattern of meaningful units, but rather of
2186320	2196400	meaning less units. In spoken language, those elements are sounds, are phonies, but you can
2196400	2203760	also have other types of meaningless elements in sign languages, so there are head movements,
2203760	2208800	hand shapes, and so forth, but they too are meaningless elements. So it turns out that
2208800	2214880	every human language has this trick, every human language has these two levels of patterning, and
2214880	2224400	I'm not aware of any exception to this rule. We are not aware of any system of animal communication
2224400	2234480	that has this trick, so animals can communicate in very complex ways, they even have rules,
2235920	2244560	so animal communication is great, but the design is different to ours, it's not a value statement
2244560	2251120	of which one is better and which one is worse, it's different. We have this double layer of
2251120	2257120	patterning and we are not, we are yet to find an animal that has that, so I think that's such
2257120	2263920	as something that's unique to human. But again, the field is very much divided as to whether there
2263920	2270560	is anything beyond that, in fact it defines language, that is unique to language and whether
2270640	2278080	it's specific to language and this debate is ongoing. Yeah, and of course, I'm assuming this opens
2278080	2285040	up many other avenues such as if you want to create an agent, let's say an AI agent, that engages in
2285040	2290320	language the way humans do, we need to understand first of all what our design principles are,
2291040	2297120	to even build something. Well, this is where we get to the Skinner-Chomsky debate, right, because
2297120	2305600	the AI, the current AI view, takes the view of let this all emerge, if you feed it enough data and
2305600	2313520	you have a very good learning algorithm, the system will figure it out and we don't know what is it
2313520	2325440	that it figures out. Something it figures out and this is really open to a big debate right now.
2326080	2332240	In fact, I heard Chomsky, which is unbelievable, he's in his I think late 90s and he's still doing
2332240	2341120	interviews and podcasts, truly. He was saying that with LLMs, that yes, marvelous engineering
2341120	2346560	tools, but he disagrees with the kind of the notion that as you said, if you just keep feeding it more
2346560	2353520	data in like a black box kind of way, eventually we'll have some sort of AI, let's say an AI agent
2354080	2359920	that engages the language the way we do. I think his concern is what does it really tell you,
2359920	2365520	so it's a piece of engineering, but what kind of explanation does it give you about
2366400	2370960	what is the cause of every child speaking a language, so obviously children are not exposed
2370960	2380960	to this massive data, so what it's giving you is kind of, it's mimicking the ability of a child
2381920	2386480	to form sentences, but it's not clear that it's doing it in any way that is remotely
2388080	2394240	similar to what the child is doing and so doing this does not provide an explanation
2394240	2401360	of how human language actually works. I agree with this concern, so again, this is getting to
2401360	2407680	this notion of to what extent do we need to worry about what human beings bring with them
2407680	2414160	to the learning acquisition task as organisms, so to what extent do you need to look at the organism
2414160	2421120	as opposed to assuming it's all out there in the data, so the AI answer is it's mostly out there,
2421120	2428800	we need to just find a good way to milk it and Chomsky's approach was to start from the inside
2428800	2438160	and it remains in a huge debate to be determined. Yes, certainly and sometimes even a contentious
2439120	2446560	one, so the other bit is and what I love about the book is this is also in a way sort of like a
2446560	2454640	book on social psychology because it's a lot on what laypeople believe and in fact being a layperson
2454640	2462880	myself I kind of had this belief too for the longest time which is I always equated what we
2462880	2471120	call human language to reading and in the the blind story teller you state in page 203 if you
2471120	2476640	don't mind me reading it you say many people think of reading as a process of visual pattern
2476640	2482880	recognition for example being able to consistently register the contrast between symmetrical letters
2482880	2490400	such as D and B if that is the case then it stands to reason that when reading goes ory the
2490400	2497920	culprit is a visual deficit but but in reality visual patterns are just a means to an end which
2497920	2505200	is language, reading is a technology that gets you there, so professor if you could delineate what
2505200	2511360	the difference between reading and languages that that would be great please. So there are two
2511360	2517680	things we need to explain what is reading and how it differs from language yes so the true theory
2517680	2523840	what is the true science about and the second is what people think how this all works so there is
2523840	2528800	that scientific theory and there is the intuitive theory which happens to be in disagreement and
2528800	2536000	that's where we mess things up so um so there is a sense in which reading is very different from
2536000	2542320	language I often start my psychology of language classes by working really hard to
2542320	2546480	disabuse people of the notion that language and reading are the same thing they aren't
2547440	2552800	language is natural you take every child they will develop language if you don't expose them
2552800	2559440	to language they will grow one naturally even they're not exposed to a language they do it
2559520	2566640	naturally they don't need language lessons reading is not like that so most children if you don't
2566640	2571120	teach them how to read explicitly they will never read there are tons of societies that
2571120	2576880	are doing just well without reading and writing not so for language so language is
2577520	2583680	universal to all human societies reading is not so they're divorced in this sense for sure
2583680	2594160	nonetheless there is this interesting property of human brains that the neuroscientist Stanislaw
2594160	2601920	Dahan has pointed out which is when human brains come to invent a new system they don't
2601920	2610240	invent it completely an you but rather what they do is recycle existing systems that are innate
2610240	2617920	and kind of repurpose them for the new for this new purpose and the link between reading and language
2617920	2626960	exactly follows those lines so when you look at how reading systems are designed they could have been
2626960	2632400	completely divorced from language they could have been completely arbitrary but that's not the case
2632400	2640080	because the letters that we use for a system like a phobetic system like English correspond to
2640080	2650320	linguistic sounds for the most part even in writing systems as in Mandarin it's true that there are
2650320	2656960	visual origins of the symbols that they call they also have some banding component but eventually
2656960	2663360	what they stand up for is also phonological sounds they spend they they stand for syllables
2664240	2671760	so it turns out that when people come to invent language they kind of design it on the principles
2671760	2679760	of how language works you can think about it in terms of human brains when they start processing
2679760	2685360	language they start with the phonology and then so when you perceive speech that the first thing
2685360	2691600	that you get is the sound structure of language and from there you proceed to syntax and so forth
2691600	2698080	so it's like to go on the linguistic highway so to speak in the brain you need to start by having
2698080	2706000	some phonological code so if you're trying to hijack the same highway to create reading you
2706000	2713360	better start by doing by encoding phonology as well and that's how explain the correspondence
2713360	2720160	between how reading works and how language works reading as a system is taking the language or
2720160	2731360	hijacking a component of the language system and repurposing it for a new technology and that is why
2734560	2739760	all reading systems that we know encode some phonological units at some level it doesn't
2739840	2743600	necessarily need to be at the level of phonemes it could be syllables but there is also some
2743600	2751440	phonological component there is ton of research that shows that when you and I read well I'm not
2751440	2757760	an atheist speaker but when I read in my language and you read in your language even though we read
2757760	2765360	silently we will automatically extract all this phonological component as integral part of the
2766000	2770800	reading process so you think about reading as a visual affair it's something that happens only
2770800	2778960	in your eyes of course it begins with the eyes but it looks like it invariably goes through the
2778960	2787440	phonological system at some point or else reading does not work as it should so you must get some
2787440	2792800	aspects of the phonology of what you read how do we know that because if you get two words that have
2792800	2801680	the same phonology such as rose the flower and roses in two rows of you know chairs people confuse
2801680	2808800	them all the time even if you'll have ROZE which is not the word people will also confuse them
2809440	2815840	and using the proper experiments you can show that it's really the phonology that that confuses
2815840	2823120	them which shows that people have consulted this information or else they would not have
2823120	2832960	been confused so the point about showing how we stumble is to show how reading actually works
2832960	2839680	and the fact that it actually works is using phonology it's using this part of language
2839680	2845360	so that's the real theory of reading and we also know that when you know that the ability to perceive
2845440	2851840	sounds is so it's not just phonology but also speech when the ability to perceive speech sounds is
2851840	2858000	impaired this is a characteristic of dyslexia so people with dyslexia have problems with
2858000	2866320	perceiving speech sounds now that's not what lay people think so if you ask a lay person
2867200	2873600	you know johnny can't read here you know he's a six-year-old and he can't read what do you think
2873600	2879040	is wrong with him and invariably people tell you there is something that's wrong with their eyes
2879840	2884880	and if they think that there is something that's wrong with billy because of jimmy what are ratios
2885760	2892880	that if the problem is congenital which we know that's the case in dyslexia that it is a congenital
2892880	2899840	disorder people invariably think the problem can only be in the eyes it can't be the
2899840	2911760	abstract phonological thing and this arises from this intuition that people hold that what's
2911760	2917280	we hold innately so if you know that the problem is congenital that he was born with that then it
2917280	2924320	must be somewhere in their body the people don't think just genes they think like in the eyes in
2924320	2930800	the ears it can be something that is abstract that doesn't make sense that the ability to so what
2931600	2937200	dyslexia really is about is in part the mechanism that allow you to map letters to sound and which
2937200	2943280	is an abstract kind of cognitive mechanism and people have trouble recognizing that something
2943360	2953760	like that could possibly be involved or or or impaired innately so this is unfortunate because
2954720	2962560	it's first because people misunderstand what dyslexia is all about and and that's a problem because
2963680	2969360	if you think that you know if you have a child and you think that the only signal of dyslexia is
2969360	2977840	switching letters then you will find fail to identify and and help these children early as
2977840	2984880	they need to as you need to but indirectly it also tells you some something about how we think
2984880	2991760	about what is innate and what is inateness and and explain some of the other biases that
2991760	3002160	I've shown in this book that show how our misconception about what about how what what is innate
3003600	3009920	lead us to this crazy conclusion that what we know cannot possibly have an innate basis
3011200	3017520	yeah and of course this probably leads us to your twin principles the twin principles of
3017520	3022000	essentialism and dualism now I know you've spoken about this professor in many podcasts
3022000	3029840	but I still want to ask because it's a fascinating idea well to put it simply sorry you claim that
3031520	3038480	our blindness to human nature is rooted in human nature itself sorry I'm very bitter for cough
3039120	3047760	so firstly I'm wondering uh as in could you kind of you know like uh flesh out what that statement
3047760	3054160	means by the fact that that our blindness to human nature is sort of innate to it's it's sort of a
3054160	3060400	part of being human itself and then maybe from there develop the ideas of essentialism and dualism
3061120	3071200	sure so maybe let's start with with the background so upper so first the first thing to show is that
3071200	3080000	people are blind to human nature it is a thing which people may not necessarily accept because
3080720	3091760	um so many people so you know assume that when a child is born that newborns know nothing about
3091760	3097520	the world that they have no abstract concepts whatsoever that there is no possibility that
3098720	3103520	they would know for example what is an object or that they will have a notion of number
3104240	3114400	or they will have even a rudimentary notion of um good versus bad in in very basic form
3115200	3121520	and we know because we ask these questions and it turns out that it's not the case that people
3121520	3129040	simply think that nothing is innate so if you ask them well do newborns prefer happy faces to angry
3129040	3135280	faces um they'll tell you sure yeah of course they do that's actually wrong they don't so when the
3135280	3142240	experiments have been done there's no preferences for the happy face but when you ask them well will
3142880	3149200	a newborn infants understand that three sounds and three lights share something in common this
3149200	3156480	thing from say three and nine three seven three and nine lights and they'll look at you like what
3156480	3161600	and even though when you know you can explain how this can be done so you can these experiments
3161600	3166880	have been done in in fact and you can give people the exact description of how the experiment was
3166880	3172800	done and ask them to make a prediction so this is how we can study that and here here is how the
3172800	3178720	experiment was designed now tell us what will the infants do if they appreciate this fact and
3178720	3183920	they'll tell you there's no way that they they will do so and that is wrong because the experiments
3183920	3189520	have been done and newborn infants can appreciate abstract number in the sense as well as they have
3189520	3200400	a concept of object and so forth um so there is a problem here right because uh science tells us
3200400	3206080	that there is stuff that infants know and there are good reasons to think that this knowledge is
3206080	3213280	innate a because it's very difficult to explain how this can be uh uh learned from the experience
3213280	3219600	that's available to the infant in utero and second because you see it in other animals so in many of
3219600	3226080	these experiments there are parallel demonstrations in human and non-human animals say in chicks and
3226080	3232080	you find similar things and this evolutionary continuity gives you further um room to to believe
3232080	3239280	that this knowledge can be innate and yet we don't accept it right so when you ask lay people they
3239920	3245440	uh they cannot conceive of the possibility that knowledge can be innate they even kind of look
3245440	3251200	at you like this is really the very proposition seems to me less to them as as an oxymoron
3252640	3259520	so the question is why that's the case uh where this bias to innate knowledge comes from now
3260640	3268960	there can be many reasons that doesn't need to be a single answer so um but and and there have
3269040	3274560	been other proposals in the literature such as perhaps you have a lot of experience with learning
3274560	3280240	but yet you know you can learn also motor actions you can learn how to swim so why is it knowledge
3280240	3287520	specifically that you have trouble with um maybe it is you're worried about the social implications
3287520	3293440	right so if we're innately the way we are then if maybe we're different and that that's a concern
3294400	3301600	what it fails to explain is why is it knowledge specifically that that gets us exercise right
3301600	3307840	if it's we're worried that uh about social discrimination why does the notion of object
3307840	3316480	is a problem very hard to see what social relevance it has so here is my proposal
3317200	3326080	um the proposal is that this bias arises from two intuitive principles
3327760	3337120	you know that are based on innate principles so whether or not these two guys that i'll explain
3337120	3342640	are in fact innate or not is less clear but the roots certainly are so let me explain what
3342960	3350320	i'm talking about so there's one in each of the so the two kind of partners in crime and one is
3350320	3355840	called intuitive essentialism and the other is called intuitive dualism and there's lots of literature
3355840	3362880	that shows that each of them matters as we think intuitive essentialism governs how we think about
3362880	3370400	what's innate so when children think about what makes an animal look the way it does why does it
3370400	3376560	have a tail why does it have this color they're telling you there is something in insides the
3376560	3382960	animal that makes it what it is inside it body so that the notion is that there is this essence
3382960	3392960	that doesn't change it lives in your inside and it's in the body okay the problem is that people
3393200	3400320	will also think about knowledge that as if it's not in the body people think about the
3400320	3405360	knowledge as it's something that's in the mind as if the mind is ethereal and distinct from the
3405360	3411440	body so there are intuitive dualists this is completely under the hood it's not something
3411440	3418000	that it's not a doctrine they're not philosophers but even if you ask children beautiful work by
3418560	3425200	just say burying by other people who show that children think about the mind as a
3425200	3433600	ethereal distinct from the body and knowledge it lives in the mind not in the body here's the
3433600	3439120	problem right if you think about knowledge such as your understanding of number as it's not in the
3439120	3445520	body and if you think that everything that's innate must be in the body it follows that
3445520	3449760	knowledge cannot be innate because it's in the wrong place right here is the body here is the
3449760	3455360	mind there is my knowledge there is what's innate and you know that's in the wrong place it can't be
3455360	3468000	innate and this is how the bias we think arises so what I've told you so far is how our troubles
3468000	3473520	with the innateness arise from these intuitive principles but then where do these principles
3473520	3483440	come from right how to tell essentialism in both cases those are principles that are observed across
3483440	3490560	cultures even when what children for example believe is different from what they're adults so
3492640	3498800	the anthropologist Rita Stutte has done really beautiful work that shows that children in
3498800	3508160	Madagascar in a small community there they the adults talk about you know why is that a person
3508160	3514880	has something wrong with their leg well some their mother talked ill of some person and they cursed her
3514880	3523280	and that's how you know that's affected so this is this a very market view of not evolution but
3524080	3529600	basically you bodily traits are acquired through social transmission
3531920	3538800	so when you do the same experiments with children in this place they do show evidence that they
3538800	3544560	understand essence so they think that if you have two animals and one is the biological
3545200	3551680	offspring of the other what's true of the father will be true of the son rather than an adoptive
3551680	3556880	and it won't get what it gets its biology from the biological parent not from an adopting parent
3558720	3563920	so that's a just to us so essentialism is not something that's innate in the sense that you'd
3563920	3572880	see it in in in very young infants although it has some roots very early on but it seems to do
3572880	3580480	something that we just develop naturally for whatever reason you see the same for with dualism
3581120	3586720	extremely prevalent across cultures believing afterlife and the supernatural and and of course
3586720	3594880	religion and all this stuff you find it very very broadly across cultures even in cultures that do
3594880	3604560	not tend to speak about those things openly why that's the case was never clear a problem has
3604640	3612800	long suggested the the psychologist problem has suggested that maybe intuitive dualism
3612800	3618880	arises from core knowledge so what is core knowledge core knowledge are those innate systems
3618880	3630480	that infants are born with and two of those systems are critical here and one system guides
3630480	3635760	how we think about people and another guides how we think about objects and these two systems are
3635760	3642960	in contrast with each other and because of this contrast that's what leads to dualism
3644240	3651200	so the idea is that so so basically the way it works is you think about
3652400	3656720	objects behave what makes the object don't move on their own they can only move if there is a
3656720	3662400	physical contact between objects people can move on their own because of what they think what's
3662400	3669280	because of what they what's in their mind and there's obviously a tension between these two ideas
3669280	3676160	and recognizing this tension a child might decide the mind what makes a person behave
3676960	3681920	is not bad embedded it's not part of the body because you don't it doesn't obey the laws of
3681920	3690720	physics that other objects do and that's how you become a dualist in recent work in my lab we tested
3690720	3701120	this theory and what we found is that the the logic was very simple we reasoned that if dualism
3701120	3708560	really has its root if in these core knowledge systems that are innate then if you find a group
3709280	3716160	of individuals in which one of the system is impaired then that should have downstream effects
3716160	3723120	on their dualism and far the more on their ability to accept the innateness and that's exactly what
3723120	3729520	we found so in one study we looked at people with autism who are famously
3731840	3737600	ones that have difficulties reasoning about the minds of others so the people system is weaker
3737680	3744560	and indeed we found that they are kind of released from the curse so to speak so they are less dualist
3746480	3752960	than neurotypicals as you would predict and they also are less biased against innateness
3752960	3759920	also as you would predict in another study we looked at males versus females so males also
3759920	3765280	tend to be lower on the people system than females and we found the same they too
3765520	3772720	were less cursed by dualism and less also cursed by this rejection of innate knowledge
3773280	3780640	so that suggests to us that dualism itself so now I'm talking just about dualism may not be
3780640	3787760	specifically innate there may not be any selective advantage of you being a dualist directly
3788000	3797680	but maybe the roots of dualism the constellation of our core systems is such that they lead you
3797680	3805840	towards dualism and that's how they all this series of unfortunate events arises
3806400	3812240	certainly I don't know if you've written about this or worked on this in some other areas but
3812800	3818880	would you say again a bit of a speculative question that there are certain evolutionary
3818880	3826000	advantages to having these twin principles of being essentialists and dualists as in I don't
3826000	3833200	want to just say that they're arbitrarily kind of in our nature so to speak but rather do you think
3833200	3839360	there are any okay as I said there's a reason evolutionary speaking that we do have this kind
3839360	3846400	of co-knowledge so the core knowledge has advantages for sure so there is definitely
3846400	3851360	core knowledge to understanding what an object is you want a chick to go after its mother not
3851360	3856800	after you know you want to recognize it as an entity her body as an entity and having
3856800	3863520	understanding of the minds of others is definitely advantage so you don't need to assume that dualism
3863520	3869520	has an advantage it's not to assume that it's engines the two engines that make you a dualist
3869520	3875600	are innate you don't need to assume that dualism is okay you get it for free so to speak
3878480	3884240	in recent work I'm actually exploring the possibility that dualism might do some good
3884240	3889920	but until I know about it I don't want to talk about it so talk to me in a year or so and I would
3889920	3896080	love to I would love to follow up on that and on the note again of dualism and essentialism
3896080	3902400	one of again one of my favorite favorite chapters from the book which is your chapter on neuroscience
3902400	3907600	what is irrational love affair with neuroscience it's and I think this is in chapter 11 where you
3907600	3916000	say insane about the brain and interestingly just a bit of a funny anecdote in the podcasting world
3916080	3922080	currently the the the most listened to podcast is in fact a podcast by a neuroscientist
3922720	3926960	so Andrew Huberman so it's people you are absolutely right that people have this
3927600	3932720	as you said irrational love affair with neuroscience so yeah from this lens a lens of
3932720	3939840	essentialism and dualism can I kind of explain as to why lay people are insane about the brain
3940560	3947600	yeah so I think one clue comes from the fact that I don't think that people care so much about the
3947600	3955360	details about how the brain does it specifically as much as the fact that it does it so I think what
3955360	3963120	kind of every time people are kind of marveling at is the fact that the life of the mind has a basis
3963120	3972560	in the brain which should have been obvious right what what else do you expect right science tells us
3972560	3979200	that thinking is a physical affair that affects you know physical processes in the brain so of
3979200	3983920	course think you know that then of course thinking is going to show up in the brain so
3984880	3989600	what the technical literature in neuroscience is to show exactly what happens and how the brain
3989600	3995920	gives us to thinking which for the most part we don't understand so we don't understand say
3996560	4001440	anything about the computational theory of or for the most we understand very little about the
4001440	4007840	computational theory of mind and how it's actually implemented in the brain but for people that's not
4007840	4013600	what they care about so when they hear this it's really like oh it's actually in the brain that
4013600	4020640	it's that that's the news for them which is very strange indeed um if you're a dualist then that
4020640	4028960	would be big news for you because you know that that in fact if you're a dualist you have troubles
4029600	4037840	understanding how is it that um the mind can actually affect behavior so if you think about
4038800	4046400	you know I want this battle and this wish that this this your people theory tells you it's in
4046400	4052960	your mind causes my very material hand to grab the battle and how is it possible how can mind
4052960	4059200	command matter this is something that was a problem for the carts and we we did the cart and we did
4060080	4064400	some research that suggests that it's even a problem for lay people when lay people think
4064480	4070400	about such interactions it's very they have kind of a dissonance this notion that the mind can
4070400	4077040	command the body when you look at that carefully and neuroscience solves this problem because it's
4077040	4082720	telling you listen it's not the mind that's doing the you know the lifting it's the brain that
4082720	4090720	commands the hand so body interacts with body and um you know basically the problem is solved
4091680	4099120	um far the more if you're an essentialist and you believe that what's innate is in the body
4099120	4103760	and how you see it's the body that causes that's the cause of my behavior and then you're beginning
4103760	4109120	to think well maybe this is something that's kind of telling us something that's very deep in me it's
4109120	4114480	something about my essence it's something that I'm born with so if I have depression and you
4115040	4120720	detect it in my brain so all of a sudden oh there must be something that runs in the family and you
4120720	4125360	better not marry this person and and you know and and you would discriminate against them
4125360	4130000	and it's all baloney because you know the fact that something manifests in the brain tells you
4130000	4134960	nothing about whether it's innate or not and yet what we have found is that when you give people
4134960	4141200	this information they jump to the horrible conclusion that this trait depression for
4141280	4147920	instance is more likely to be innate um and and that and and they show more stigma so that's
4149120	4159040	very serious problem so dualism makes you super curious about uh the brain because it solves
4159040	4165840	the mind body dissonance um if you're an essentialist you look at the brain as providing
4165840	4171520	further evidence about what's innate and therefore speaking up to to your deep deep essence
4172400	4179840	what makes you who you are and and both of them are based on on misconceptions yeah interestingly
4179840	4186880	I wrote a funny uh rather funny essay uh even Descartes was trying to he was he was wrestling
4186880	4191280	with this problem and then he theorized that in our brain we have this thing called the pineal
4191280	4197680	gland or something and that's what gives our abstract mind to manifest in the material world and
4198480	4203600	and so not only a great philosopher like Descartes but as you said even lay people struggle with
4203600	4210400	this question uh just just I'm a bit cognizant of the time professor but a quick tangential point
4210400	4216800	tangential question in fact it's on the idea of emotions uh and and in in one part of the book
4216800	4226320	you say that this idea that innate computational mechanisms are alchemy um and I believe in fact
4226320	4232320	let me just read out the excerpt that's okay on page 168 you say that it is bad enough to assert
4232320	4238480	that emotions are computations claiming that these computations are innate goes way too far
4239120	4245280	but this is precisely what evolutionary psychology asserts and in doing so it challenges our co-beliefs
4245280	4253040	to the max not only does it claim that emotions are computations rather than bodily states it further
4253040	4261440	suggests that the mechanisms that affect this reck reckoning are innately specialized that there is
4261440	4268480	one innate program for shame another innate program for maternal love and so on so I guess my
4268480	4275360	question would be uh what what is the lay person's understanding of of emotions uh and then would be
4275360	4286240	what does at the moment the current science tells us or the truth let's say um so lay people
4287520	4293200	consider emotions very important for who they are they think of them as part of their essence
4293280	4298640	but of course they think that anything that's innate must be in the body so when we ask them
4299520	4305600	you know to predict whether certain emotions are innate what we found is that people think that
4306400	4312640	emotions that they consider to be um embodied that you can see them in the face so they think
4312640	4318080	they manifest in your stomach and so forth those are the emotions that are more likely to be innate
4318720	4325120	and you can find that's exactly what of course essentialism predicts and you can further show
4325120	4331280	this causal link such that if you give people information that a certain emotion is in the
4331280	4337360	body so if you say tell them you made a scan brain scan and you can detect it in the body
4337360	4342000	they jump to the conclusion that this emotion is innate so people think that
4342560	4353680	um again link innateness to to um being in the body um and as we said people don't think that
4355840	4365120	thinking generally what you know cannot possibly be innate um so you because of this you think
4365120	4373680	about emotions as bodily states rather than as um cognitions as way of thinking um
4375200	4383040	there it's interesting though that it's interesting when you look at the history of the field and
4383040	4388880	you see how these debates are are running that um there's the question of whether emotions are innate
4388880	4393520	is is very very controversial and most of this literature about whether emotions are innate
4394240	4401600	really looks at the question of whether emotions show up mostly in the face also in the voice but
4401600	4408480	mostly in the face and then there is a huge debate between those that say that universally
4408480	4415120	facial emotions that that facial emotions are universal and in those that are not and um
4416000	4420240	I'm just sitting I mean that's not my field I'm reading this and I see that the results are very
4420240	4425520	mixed and then there there's evidence to support both sides but you wonder why people
4425520	4432080	are asking this question in the first place so why assume that emotions are just facial expressions
4432080	4438720	to start with from a methodological perspective I could understand why people started looking at
4438720	4444080	that this way because you know that's an easy way to look at you know people in small scale societies
4444080	4450480	and to um look at their emotional uh understanding but it shouldn't it there's no reason to assume
4450480	4455600	that it must be this way there's no in fact you know there might be an evolutionary advantage
4455600	4460800	for not revealing your emotional expressions and then to be you know to being a poker player
4461440	4468880	so notion that if if it's innate it must show in in the face seems like like why make this
4468880	4476080	assumptions in the first place um I I don't know you know there might be as I pointed out
4476080	4484640	why scientists think the way they do it's hard to tell but um one wonders whether this resistance
4484640	4491600	that there is to this notion that emotions or computations might come from from this same
4491600	4497840	empiricist bias and that's exactly what evolutionary psychologists claim right so if
4497840	4504640	you know um there are there's research that ask why what is the basis of shame and the answer is
4504640	4510640	it's not necessarily that it's a certain facial expression but rather it's a computation that is
4510640	4519280	designed to uh uh protect you from social devaluation so the idea is that uh you want to keep your
4519280	4524480	good standing in society and if there is a danger of it being devaluated because somebody
4524480	4531120	observed you doing something awful that will cost you you don't want that to happen and
4531120	4537920	shame protects you from this uh from uh it's kind of an internal signal to to attend to this problem
4539040	4546080	that makes predictions about what circumstances should elicit shame and when evolutionary
4546080	4551440	scientists uh have looked at this question they found support for this idea across cultures so
4551440	4556320	for example if you do something something awful happens to you if you do something shameful
4556320	4562320	if other people watch it then uh your shame you predict the same response to be more serious
4563520	4572640	and which is exactly what this theory predicts um so in the segment you've read I tried to answer
4572640	4581040	the question of why people do not uh think about typically about emotions in this way and the answer
4581040	4589360	is that such computations do not intuitively seem like they could possibly be innate um because
4589360	4595120	people don't think that knowledge can be innate so um that that can explain the resistance position
4595120	4601120	this notion excellent um all right professor since we've only got a few moments left I would love to
4601120	4606640	get to the more speculative questions I don't want to miss out on that uh and I was glad to hear
4606720	4611120	that you said before we started recording that you in fact are in the process of publishing a
4611120	4617120	paper on and core layer uh or the question of consciousness it's published it's already published
4617120	4622400	excellent so it's uh and and it pertains to dualism and essentialism too right though the
4622400	4627760	work you've currently been doing yes to infect both of them yes excellent yeah so uh yeah just in
4627760	4633760	general uh what are your sort of intimations on the idea of core layer and then a bit more specifically
4634720	4642000	how would how does cognition differ from what philosophers call core layer or in fact does it
4642000	4652720	differ at all I'm not in a position really to to answer this question um people have uh a sense
4652720	4661440	of their uh uh conscious experiences um and they have some intuitions about what they are
4662400	4674320	and in the research that and I think that the big debate in the field is um how we do uh
4675280	4684080	uh what is consciousness um and and uh what is the its place in you know in reality in ontology
4685040	4694640	and um the work of the brilliant philosopher David Chalmers uh has long argued that uh
4696000	4702240	consciousness is distinct from the body so um for example you can think about other creatures
4702240	4706560	that will have your body but will not have the same conscious experiences as you have
4707600	4716320	and um debt to him I I'm not doing justice to his argument but basically what the conclusion
4716320	4722240	that he arrives at is the notion that um consciousness is not physical properties it is
4722240	4728480	distinct from the physical and this is not because you think about it this way it is this way for him
4728480	4734560	so he believes that this reflects how things are ontologically that in reality consciousness is
4734560	4742240	distinct from the physical but of course we just spent like um an hour and a half talking about
4742240	4748560	how we are intuitive dualist so one wonders is that really because consciousness is distinct
4748560	4757120	from the body or because it only seems distinct to the body in our human eyes and in many so
4759200	4764240	Chalmers gives several examples in which those things go together and it's really difficult
4764240	4771360	to tell which one is going on but in one of these examples which indeed concerns uh uh
4771360	4780000	qualia uh the the conscious experiences of say seeing a red rose um these properties dissociate
4780000	4787920	in a way that one can uh I don't know if we have time not to go into all the predictions but basically
4788480	4794800	this is a case where if you take dualism and essentialism together it will make you predict
4794800	4800640	that people should think about what it takes for you so what happens when you see a rose for the
4800640	4806880	first time if it really alters you in a significant way then it must be something that pertains to
4806880	4812240	your essence and where is your essence it's in your body so that would predict that the properties
4812640	4818400	the conscious experiences that are possibly transformative the ones that are really important
4818400	4823520	to you are bound to be those experiences that you can link to the body or else they can't
4823520	4830640	pretend to your essence they can't be transformative um as I read the Chalmers view
4830640	4835280	for him consciousness is distinct from the body so it should all experiences should be
4835280	4842480	separate from the body um and and it should not depend on how how how significant that is
4842480	4847680	is your experience should not depend on how embodied it is because it's not an embodied affair
4848400	4853680	but that's not what we found what we found was that when people are given those vignettes and
4853680	4859920	asked to make predictions about that what they believe is that if you're going to gain a significant
4859920	4864560	experience you're seeing a rose for the so one of these famous examples marrying the black and
4864560	4869680	white room marises a rose for the first time and we're asking people well is it significant for her
4869680	4875360	and to say sure it is and if you're going to run a brain scan is it going to show up in the brain
4875360	4881920	and tell you yes and which means they think about this conscious experience as part of the physical
4881920	4889840	world and in fact you know you can make various you know twists on that and the bottom line is
4889840	4895120	as you gain a conscious experience if you compare that an experience in which she just sees the
4895120	4901360	rose and she's not conscious of it and wanting which she sees it and it is conscious what's the
4901360	4907280	difference well being conscious is more significant it's also more likely to manifest in the body
4909280	4915280	I see I see so and the more likely it is to manifest in the body the more physical you see the
4915280	4923120	more the stronger is the experience which is not what you would expect right but if the original
4923120	4927280	explanation child was explanation of the black and white marrying the black and white room is
4928640	4934720	what she what you think the conscious experience is distinct from the body and somehow you're
4934720	4939600	privy to this factor else why we care about your intuitions about this case in the first place
4940320	4947680	so consciousness is different from the body and your and your privy to that and yes people
4948560	4954800	have intuitions about that but in their view you know consciousness is actually an embodied experience
4955600	4962320	so and furthermore in other research in another experiment of this series we found that the more
4962320	4969040	dualist they are the more likely the stronger their intuitions about Mary so there is very strong
4969040	4976960	evidence that suggests that the source of this of the of of what you gain in consciousness people
4976960	4983360	think about that conscious experience as something that is very physical very in very much in the
4983360	4991600	body in this paper explain exactly how dualism and essentialism conspired to give you this intuition
4991600	4997200	so how you can be both dualist but also essentialism can make you think about that transformative
4997200	5002400	experience of being in the body but I think it presents some challenge to this notion that
5003360	5008640	so you can explain everything that's going on in our into either you assume that the initial
5008640	5013600	assumption that we can have intuitions about consciousness is false this is one possibility
5014160	5021520	or if you do assume that we have intuitions about consciousness then what this suggests is the sort
5021520	5028800	that well at the very least what this suggested that the the reason why we see consciousness
5028800	5036080	the way we view we do comes from our internal biases there is no need to assume anything about
5036080	5044400	ontology here so of course I can't tell anything about what ontology is but the psychology of that
5044400	5049760	gives a very compelling story yeah but interestingly it's only a philosopher that would kind of
5049760	5056160	ontologize and try to maybe argue like a charm is this that consciousness is something separate from
5056160	5064560	the body yeah but it has been a very influential argument and one that neuroscientists have been
5065840	5072880	quite engaged with yeah uh what okay professor is it okay if you go about five minutes over time
5072880	5078320	or do you I just want to ask you I'm quite curious about this question given you're a cognitive
5078320	5084720	psychologist uh so psychoanalysis I've been fascinated by for a for a long time in fact but
5084720	5091760	more from a philosophical angle and in fact I got into it through philosophy and this the late
5091760	5097440	mario Rudy who was working in an English department in fact so it certainly isn't a science but just
5098320	5103520	as a cognitive scientist what are your intimations and views on the field of psychoanalysis
5103520	5115840	um I'm I'm not as educated as I would want to be um there are definitely some very
5116640	5124400	concrete empirical criticism of Freud that I think are very well placed um about the
5124400	5131920	falsifiability of his proposal and uh it's empirical adequacy and all that all this criticism
5131920	5141040	is very well placed but I think it was a genius I think he gave cognitive science two of its most
5141040	5148640	precious ideas um the first is the idea of the subconscious I mean I don't know the history
5148640	5153760	of ideas sufficiently to know whether we should really credit him for that but suddenly he got it
5153760	5160320	right this is certainly the core of everything everything that's interesting about cognition
5160960	5166960	generally in language specifically happens totally under the hood it's not something that
5166960	5176560	people capture and he had the stature to have this insight and I think this is very significant
5176560	5183120	and we owe him a debt of gratitude the other the debt of gratitude that I think is important and
5183120	5189760	people sometimes look at that this kind of um kind of the they take it against him and I don't
5189760	5199200	was this notion that thinking about the psyche in physicalist terms so he had this thermodynamic
5199200	5206800	notion of the psyche um and people say oh yeah you always apply the latest in science to study the
5206800	5213920	psyche but it is not trivial to think about the psyche as a physical system because we are dualist
5214480	5221600	so this is the farthest from us to think that one can explain psychological processes in physical
5221600	5227920	terms but this is exactly the basis of the computational theory of mind the notion that
5229120	5236160	the reason the thinking is a mechanical process that manipulates this form of representations
5236960	5241760	and this notion that you can think about the psyche as a physical system is brilliant
5242320	5249840	not something that's available to us intuitively at all so I think Freud had two very big ideas that
5251760	5257280	I again it's I leave it to somebody else to make the analysis of where these ideas came from and
5257280	5265280	how they stayed with us but for nothing else I think that these are really one of the most
5265280	5270560	important ideas that stay with us these days and the two should be very grateful for them
5271120	5278160	certainly I mean in line with this book you'd say that at least Freud could go against his human
5278160	5284640	nature and overcome the blindness to study the psyche as a physical assistant excellent
5284640	5288640	thank you for that professor Berwin I know that these are highly speculative questions but they
5288640	5296560	always do fascinate me uh well I'd love to ask what so sorry just one other thing the paper
5296560	5300880	that you mentioned when we were talking about uh qualia and consciousness what exactly was the
5300880	5309680	name of the paper it appeared uh in the journal open mind and the name of the paper I'm the author
5309680	5315920	on that and I should have should have known what is it called if I if I emailed you afterwards
5315920	5322240	and I can put it in the description down below for people to read I can tell you in a second
5322800	5328320	I felt look at my references and this one is called the heart problem of consciousness arises
5328320	5334480	from human psychology excellent I shall find it and put it in the description and it's an open
5334480	5339920	access so you can read it that is that is lovely yeah so uh professor what other projects are you
5339920	5345280	working on what other are there any books in the pipeline I'd love to hear give us a bit of a teaser
5345360	5353440	on what's next uh there's a project on dualism that's coming and and some of uh you know some of
5353440	5361200	the the obvious um problems of dualism but possibly also some of the um silver lining of
5361200	5366720	being a dualist and how you live a dualist life so yes how to live a dualist life but it's probably
5366720	5372800	going to be a self-help book by no I'm joking that's not the intention but yeah absolutely I'm
5372880	5377280	joking of course but nah thank you so much I'm grateful for your time professor this this means
5377280	5383120	a lot to me especially given hopefully next year I'll be doing my master's program and then I'm
5383120	5389360	certainly uh more excited than I could put it in words so thank you thank you so much
5389360	5394640	pleasure talking to you good luck on your master's I look forward to seeing what you do
