00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Hey everyone, I just want to make this quick video for one of my favorite

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,000
YouTubers and people on the internet right now, coffeezilla, a message from a

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,520
fan. I love his work. I think he's one of the most important people on the

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,080
internet right now. He's doing true journalism, exposing these scams and

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,800
just it's to a almost bizarre and absurd level when a normal guy like me just

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,240
sees them and it's unbelievable. And I think he's in great work. He is

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,960
extremely insightful, he's brilliant, he works hard and what he creates, his

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,920
content is of true value to society. I truly believe that and I'm not trying to

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,720
you know blow steam up your ass, I mean sincerely. However, saying all that, saying

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,520
all that, here comes the jab jab and the right hook. I do think he makes a huge

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,840
mistake. I think he gets one point room, especially when I see him on

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,000
podcasts, on huge podcasts like Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan. He portrays all

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,160
these scams as being anomalies to the current neoliberal capitalistic order. He

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,200
in fact even says that I'm a capitalism, there's really nothing wrong with

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,320
capitalism, it's just these things are the anomalies. And I think he makes a

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,440
mistake there. I think the best way to portray it is to in fact understand that

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,400
these scams are built into the, are built into capitalism itself. They're built

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,280
into the antagonisms, the deadlocks, the consumerism, the desires that capitalism

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,000
creates and these scams aren't anomalies and they'll only keep getting worse in

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,040
the current economic system and the current ideological system we live in. So

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,840
look, if he's interested in Epshrew's theory, I would highly recommend him read

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,200
anything by Slavoj Džek. Essentially any of these books probably start with the

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,920
plague of fantasies, but if he really wants to get some some heavy stuff,

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:10,560
perhaps start with Karl Marx's capital. Now don't get me wrong, while I am an

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,320
anti-capitalist, I'm not saying that Marxism is the answer. I don't know what

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,320
the answer is to be honest, but sometimes it's not even the answers itself, but

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,600
it's the questions that count and perhaps we should start questioning why do

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,280
these scams come up every couple of years and why is it, why does it seem like

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,160
things are getting worse for the middle class? Why does it seem like we're in the

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,680
midst of an ecological crisis and in the midst of a mental health crisis, in the

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,040
midst of a almost existential crisis for most people where there are terms like

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,880
debts of despair and those questions are perhaps important asking and maybe it is

33
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,200
because of our current ideological system, our current hegemonic system of

34
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,840
capitalism and all these scams, they never really aren't going to go away.

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,360
It doesn't matter how many scams Coffizula exposes, as long as things

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,840
remain the way they are, they'll still unfortunately still keep coming up and

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,280
in fact, probably even get worse. I do like the joke by Slavo Žižek where it's this kind of naive,

38
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,720
I'm not saying Coffizula is naive, I'm saying all of us, we're all naive, we have this

39
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,720
naive hope that there's a light at the end of the tunnel and then Žižek says,

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,200
oh, that light is in fact an oncoming train. So in fact, we make structural changes.

41
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,040
Yes, it's important to make changes in individual action and certainly do things

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,960
like what Coffizula does where we expose these scams, expose these frauds and even

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,240
partake in local communities and try to not get people caught up in MLM schemes or pyramid schemes

44
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,640
or Ponzi schemes or whatnot and all these little games that are that are imbued out of capitalism,

45
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,120
but still we have to make a structural critique and I think given Coffizula is currently

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,600
extremely influential and we all know how internet fame works, there's a rice,

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,760
you got to make good use of it and then it goes away and people just kind of forget about you,

48
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,640
but at this moment he can really embrace the opportunity and use his platform to show that

49
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,080
no, these scams aren't anomalies, they in fact are built into our system itself.

50
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:32,000
Simply that's what I want to say and I would highly recommend watching lectures by Žižek on

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,480
this matter or even Žižek is a bit too, because he comes from a very theoretical abstract angle

52
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,280
reading a book like Capital by Piketty, where yes Piketty for me isn't radical enough,

53
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:53,040
but still he does make some good points as to why we in fact are in deep shit

54
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,480
and we need to make some fundamental changes in society.

55
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Okay, I talk too much, I shall let you go. Cheers.
