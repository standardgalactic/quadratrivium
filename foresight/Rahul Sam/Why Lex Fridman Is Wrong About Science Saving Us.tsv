0	5360	It probably isn't anyone right now who's doing a better job than Lex Friedman at showing the
5360	10720	beauty of science and scientific discourse. Because of Lex, ordinary people like me have the
10720	16080	opportunity to listen to the most brilliant months in the world as if we are just nonchalantly chatting
16080	21360	over a beer. And I'm sure there's an innumerable number of people who have turned on to programming,
21360	26960	AI and science in general, because of the Lex Friedman podcast. With his starry-eyed curiosity,
26960	33360	Lex, resembling Dostoevsky's idiot, not only makes science accessible for new fights like myself,
34000	40080	but also shows his viewers the absolute necessity and pertinence of science in our own lives.
40080	45280	So of course, he's right in venerating the scientific enterprise, but science too has its
45280	51120	shortcomings, like every man-made philosophical enterprise. And that's why I think Lex Friedman
51120	56400	is wrong in believing science will save us. Now, when I do make a video where I'm disagreeing with
56400	63440	one of my heroes, a person who's had an unbelievable influence in my life that I can't just even put
63440	70000	in words, I probably need to make this caveat or have this caveat where I try to convey what the
70000	76640	purpose and intent behind this video is. This isn't a gotcha or a Ben Shapiro debunk slash destroy
76640	84480	this kind of video. Like those early 2010, edgy atheist anti-SJW stuff that used to be on YouTube,
85200	91600	not because I'm above them or I'm saying that, you know, I find them below me. I actually found
91600	97520	them quite entertaining, but they were just that. All I found them were pretty much entertainment,
98080	104000	but I don't think any of those really edgy kind of videos changed my mind. So I don't want this
104000	107840	video to be that, because I just find them unproductive. Rather, I want to try and delineate
107840	113200	and expound on what I think are philosophical differences between Lex and myself in the hopes
113200	118320	of finding some kind of synthesis to its trip. My disagreement is that when Lex considers our
118320	124160	reality and the human experience, he makes generalizing statements about science like this.
124160	130240	I wonder if there's something that could have been done better to give people hope
131360	134800	that science will save us as opposed to science will divide us.
135520	140320	Or when he says science wins through love and humility. For example, this was from Lex Freeman
140320	146320	podcast 238 with Francis Collins, where they discussed the pervasive pandemic on our reaction to
146320	154080	it. In the battle of ideas, I think humility and love wins. And that's how science wins,
154080	158640	not through having quote unquote truth. Now to be fair, though, when Lex uses the term
158640	164960	science colloquially, I don't mean he means it in the academic or scholarly way, the word science
164960	171120	would be used, which involves, you know, empiricism and the systematic categorization or organization
171120	175920	of knowledge. Since he is a romantic like myself, I think he talks about the beauty of the scientific
175920	183040	enterprise of what it is for a conscious entity like a human being to do science, which is in
183040	188480	reality more different from what science means technically. Regardless of the semantics, I think
188480	194720	because of science's almost miraculous rise to influence and it's become so
194720	201680	ubiquitous and just a part of our day to day life as a society, we've unfortunately begun to
201680	208480	replace the whole of the human experience with just science. And I think the problem with that is that
209360	216160	in some sense, when we replace the whole by a singular, so the whole of the human experience
216160	221840	by a singular aspect or a fragment of the human experience like the scientific enterprise,
222560	226080	it begins to lack any balance, let's say.
230960	236480	Because in the real world, as I kind of touched on, the scientific enterprise itself is nested
236480	242560	within the broader human experience. And I think we make this mistake or we confuse these two things
242560	248960	at our own peril as we evidently see in the unraveling times we live in. So if I could consider
248960	254400	Lex's podcast itself, I'm glad he changed the name from artificial intelligence to the Lex
254400	260640	Friedman podcast. Artificial intelligence is a multidisciplinary academic and scientific discipline.
260640	266160	The Lex Friedman podcast is a phenomenon that an observer experiences in different things. And I'd
266160	271840	even postulate that people are not necessarily attracted to AI, but rather to the Lex Friedman
271840	278640	podcast where the discussion of AI, another sub experience, so to speak, is only a part of the
278640	284560	broader podcast experience. My point being, there is something to our experience. Let's make it a bit
284560	291040	more tangible and say the experience of learning that transcends mere scientific empiricism and
291040	296000	materialism. So I've made all these claims, but I really haven't backed any of it up. And that's
296000	300880	what I hope to do in the rest of the video. But before I do do that, I kind of want to try and
300880	306880	once again succinctly lay down my points using a bit of brevity, something that I'm terrible at,
306880	314560	because I'm quite verbose. Anyways, here's my point. My assertions are the scientific enterprise
314560	321040	doesn't encompass all of the human experience. Rather, science is nested within something
321040	327840	transcendental. Therefore, it's wrong to unequivocally assume that science will save us or be the
327920	334480	ultimate panacea to our predicaments. Science is merely a tool to be exploited to use a somewhat
334480	340640	dramatic term by our values, which lies in a different domain, possibly the religious.
340640	345040	So to try and elucidate my points, I'll break down the rest of this video into two parts.
345040	351120	Firstly, the fact value distinction. I'll discuss the axiomatic presuppositions we used to think
351120	356960	and act in this world. I'll try and understand the qualitative distinction between values and how
357040	362880	facts are always, bar none, filtered through our bellies, more specifically, moral bellies.
362880	367760	And then I'll use Jonathan Pedro's ideas of the hierarchy of bellies to show how science is
367760	374240	nested within religion. Secondly, I'll discuss the dangers of scientific utopianism, the totalitarian
374240	380720	impulse of reason by coupling my concerns of scientism with the ideas from Jonathan Haidt's
380720	384800	moral foundations theory. And then of course, we're looking to Alexa's favorite novelist,
384800	390400	Fyodor Dostoevsky's critique of utopian thinking with his use of the crystal palace in his
390400	395040	literature. You know, it's very common in the media where there's some political pundit or
395040	402080	commentator that say with rather overweening confidence, follow the science, they declare
402080	407520	that we ought to follow the science. But the problem is, none of us can truly follow the
407520	411840	science the way they mean it. Because when someone makes a statement, they make this
411920	417520	presupposition that we know where to begin with. They make the presupposition that we've got axioms
417520	423200	to start this journey of following the science with. I mean, to put it plainly, when someone says
423200	428960	follow something, that assumes there's a beginning point or a start and an end. Like for example,
428960	435200	a topic that comes to my mind is something that's of course innocuous and not controversial at all,
435200	441360	like COVID and vaccines. You know, from both sides in this whole debate, people say follow the
441360	446400	science. And you know, there are some people who are pro vex, some people are anti vex, some people
446400	453120	are pro lockdowns, anti lockdowns, or there are people like me who are, you know, lockdowns to a
453120	458240	certain extent. And then afterwards open up society, people should get vaccinated and then,
458240	463200	you know, move on with your lives, but don't cause or mandate the vaccines. Sorry, I had to
463200	469200	say all of that just to clarify my stance. But the point being, you see, all these people in some
469200	475760	sense, we are all given the same data. We're at least exposed to similar variables, let's say.
476320	481600	However, the debate about COVID isn't scientific anymore. It's completely value space. It's
481600	488480	completely on what that starting point is, what those axioms that we use to begin our journey of
488480	493680	following the science's whip. It's nothing to do with what the epidemiology says. Instead,
493680	500000	epidemiology or science in general is used as a tool to accentuate ethical contentions
500000	505200	in this debate. At a minimum, we all used economics, politics, science, our personal
505200	512480	intuitions, insight, et cetera, and did a sort of multivariate analysis consciously or subconsciously.
512480	518080	The scientific facts itself never makes a decision for us because they simply can't do so.
518160	523680	Rather, these facts were always filtered through a philosophical framework or more accurately,
523680	529600	an indispensable narrative structure, the Seneca known that a person uses to interpret and filter
529600	534160	through reality. Therefore, speaking somewhat figuratively, the moment human consciousness
534160	540800	becomes part of the equation, a fact value and a is odd distinction is created. So a big part of
540800	546160	the whole COVID debate, of course, was the idea of safety. We took all these measures so that we
546160	552080	can be safe. But safety itself isn't a scientific value. It doesn't exist in the domain of science.
552080	557680	Safety is actually deeply subjective. Some people are more risk averse, some people are more tolerant
557680	563360	towards risks. And these things differ broadly in a massive society. People don't want the same
563360	569680	thing. Some people value safety or freedom and people like me value freedom over safety. We just
569680	574480	simply have to make trade-offs depending on our values. And all these different groups, let's say,
574480	580800	hypothetically, even in a perfect world, were given the same exact scientific findings, the same
580800	586000	exact scientific data. This is what they were exposed to. They would all come up with different
586000	591200	conclusions. They'd all have different ending points because their axioms, their starting points,
591200	597520	or let's call it their odds and odds, or nots are different. And these ethics that herald our
597520	604560	actions, so to speak, they come from a much deeper set of moral values, something that is beyond
604560	608560	science, something that's beyond rationality, that's something that's, I'd even argue,
608560	615040	transcendent. It goes to the domain of religious and the domain of mythology and narrative. And in
615040	620240	the domain of values, in the domain of the religious, the verification method or positivism or whatever
620240	625440	you call it, that has worked so well in the scientific domain, in the scientific enterprise,
625440	628560	isn't simply going to work. It's where reason and rationality,
628560	632640	culturally speaking, runs out. And I'm going to say something which
632640	638560	some people are quite averse to. It goes to the domain of the mystical, the transcendentally
638560	643200	ineffable. And all these things that we've taken for granted for the longest time,
643840	651680	and to use a union term, I think these values, these deeply held moral values, or these deeply
651760	658000	held stories that, let's say, imbue our moral values to use a union term are embedded in our
658000	662320	collective unconscious. And of course, needless to state, none of these ideas come from me.
662320	667040	Philosophers, religious thinkers have been trying to debate, understand and seek out answers to
667040	672160	these questions since time immemorial. Reading a bit of philosophy, it's actually a beautiful
672160	676960	experience knowing that people have always pondered and thought about these questions.
677680	683040	And it's always been a part of the wisdom tradition, and it's always been something
683040	687520	everyone's spoken about a lot, even though I think now it's spoken about less.
687520	691520	Then again, a recent acclaimed conversation that took place a couple of years ago,
691520	697360	the debate between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris on truth and morality,
697360	702080	is a good example on how pertinent these ideas are to our life.
702080	706400	And even though I hate to reduce such rich conversations to a bunch of propositions,
706400	710800	I have to do so for the sake of brevity. The gist of the debate was Harris believes
710800	716080	values and moral principles can be derived or inferred from facts. Much like he doesn't
716080	721840	as book the moral landscape, he challenges Hume's yes or problem, and asserts and ought
721840	726240	what to do can be derived from a what is on the grounds of increasing well-being.
726240	730560	Peterson, of course, disagrees. However, unlike most of Sam's debate is, he doesn't
730560	736880	merely place a somewhat arbitrary goal as an unforeseeable propositional axiom. Rather,
736880	742400	he sees religious narrative and story which involves God as being an ontic point for us
742400	747120	to live and act in this world. As a union, he tries to demonstrate how archetypes act
747120	751840	as intermediary structures to arrange the facts in such a way to imbue values.
751840	755520	According to him, stories aren't true in the sense of a scientific fact,
755520	760080	that they are meditates by marshalling our actions on what to do with the fact.
760080	764960	So Harris' claims of increasing well-being is essentially a narrativized,
764960	770480	necessary axiomatic presupposition that prevents an infinite regress, which is not a fact.
771200	776640	I don't know if I have a stance on this matter. I don't think anyone really truly
776640	780960	has a stance on this matter, and if anyone does, either they're lying or they're just being
780960	784560	unbelievably hubristic. But I would say that I happen to
784560	790480	stand or agree a lot more with Peterson than Sam Harris. The more I've pulled about and I'd even
790480	796720	say struggled with these questions, I think I've come to the realization that one cannot infer
796720	803600	values from facts or values from truth, we'll say, without being self-referential and presuppositional.
803600	808480	My best intuition of this, I'd say, actually comes from someone I've been reading recently,
809440	816960	Mr. Nietzsche, his idea, his philosophy of perspectivism, where we can't divorce
817840	823120	observation or understanding of the world from our perspective. We don't just observe the world
824480	829840	plainly without any perspective or without, we are a conscious being where the world is
829840	834640	observed and filtered through us. So in this filtering process, we do have a values framework.
834720	839600	We have certain narratives and beliefs that we hold, and knowingly or unknowingly,
839600	843600	the world is interpreted through this. Interestingly, speaking about Nietzsche,
843600	848160	he also makes a point in Döngeren Evel, and I think a couple of his other books that,
848160	855280	you know, Christianity by its this ardent and sort of, you know, vigorous drive, let's say,
855280	860240	towards truth, because in Christianity, truth is the highest ideal, Christ himself is the embodiment
860240	865920	of truth that Christianity ended up destroying itself by giving rise to science. I don't think
865920	871600	I know what to make of that statement. I don't know what that tells us about contemporary society.
871600	877760	However, that does lead me to probably one of the most radical and incomprehensible points
878320	883280	for us modern people that made by Jonathan Pedro, a Christian near-playtoness,
883920	890880	where he explicated how science is nested within religion, not in some inadvertent,
890880	895520	pragmatic or inspirational sense where religion inspired people to do science,
895520	902960	but rather that without religion itself, literally, science cannot exist. Apart from the enigmatic
902960	908960	kind, Jonathan Pedro's work has had the biggest influence in changing my view on science. He helped
909040	914640	me realize that science has a problem. Science cannot define or categorize itself, and as a result,
914640	919840	it has to make arbitrary, mercurial accidents. And this always goes wrong as we see from the
919840	924560	politicization of science these days. One of Jonathan's contemporaries and another intellectual hero
924560	930400	of mine, John Revekey, explains this paradoxical dilemma of science best in Jordan Peterson's
930800	938080	science. The science exists. Okay, if it is, what kind of entity is it? And tell me using
938080	945280	physics or chemistry or even biology, use just though that ontology and those methodology,
945280	951280	tell me what science is, and tell me how it has the status to make the claims it does,
951280	956480	and tell me how science is related to meaning and truth, and how do meaning and truth fit
956480	961840	into the scientific worldview? They're presupposed by that worldview, but they have no proper place
961840	967680	within it. That's what I mean. So whenever we're doing the science and saying, this is what the
967680	976720	world is, we are absenting ourselves from it. We have no home in which we are properly situated.
976720	983440	And I think that ramifies through everything we think, say, and do to each other and with each
983440	987680	other in a profoundly corrosive way. That's what I mean by the meaning. It's to this problem,
987680	993200	Jonathan Pagel replies with his explanation of the hierarchy of values using symbolism and
993200	998880	religious language of the neo-Pedonist kind. He postulates that as science itself is a product
998880	1005280	of consciousness, it cannot exist without a higher old encompassing framework, which ultimately is
1005280	1010480	what religious language attempts to portray. In this video using the example of a mountain,
1010480	1016400	Jonathan points out that such language is a type of meta language or meta process
1016400	1021440	that contains science within it. And in some sense, gives it meaning. So in relation to modern
1021440	1027440	science, religious language would be something like something of a meta process or a meta language,
1027440	1036160	because it tries to express the thing it is focusing on, let's say a mountain, while also
1036160	1042880	expressing the process by which that focus is even possible. So if modern science can describe
1042880	1051840	a mountain height with terrain, its foliage, its mineral constitution, religious language is expressing
1052640	1059520	why I have a category like mountain in the first place, why that category is relevant to humans,
1059520	1066480	basically what does a mountain mean? So the scientists will retort something like this,
1066480	1074640	will retort something like a mountain doesn't mean anything. But to say so is to ignore the human
1074640	1082240	variable, ignore that we are the ones looking at the mountain, even if I believe that that mountain
1082240	1090560	is outside of my tiny existence. It ignores consciousness, ignores why I would bother to
1090560	1097120	have a category like mountain. It ignores that I have to climb a mountain or go around a mountain
1097120	1104080	when it's in my way. It ignores the effect going up a mountain has on human consciousness.
1105920	1110720	All those things are real. There are no more illusions than the scientific data.
1111360	1117600	Symbolism tries to take all of that into account, that is discuss a mountain without pretending that
1117600	1125600	we are not human beings living in a world of mountains. So it does have a personal and social
1125600	1132080	aspect to it because it takes into account consciousness, but it isn't just personal and
1132080	1139520	social. And also taking consciousness into account doesn't mean that it's a relative thing and
1139520	1145680	subjective in the way that we see that word today, subjective in the sense of idiosyncratic,
1145680	1153760	arbitrary, to my own particularities and preclivities. There's a universal aspect to the experience of
1153760	1164720	a mountain. So the religious language is above the scientific language and contains the scientific
1164720	1170400	process within it, makes it possible. You know, a lot of caveats have been added in this video,
1170400	1175680	I think, but I do want to add another one. I want to make this after I listen to a debate
1175680	1180800	between Jonathan Pedro and rationally roots. The reality of what Jonathan's talking about,
1180800	1186480	to understand that, or even to understand the fact value distinction, it truly does require
1186480	1193120	a rather radical paradigm shift in one's thinking. But also, I think more importantly,
1193200	1197280	we really have to start paying attention to our conscious experience. It's funny,
1197280	1203840	a lot of these skeptics or rationalists always say, follow the evidence. I go where the evidence
1203840	1210960	leads me. And I can't believe how much people can lack in self-awareness to believe that
1210960	1216320	they're so open-minded. I don't think any of us are as open-minded, or let's say we are like a
1216320	1222000	sponge that just absorbs evidence and just changes our worldviews based on the evidence the way we
1222000	1226400	think we'd like to be. It's really difficult to change our mind. So at least I'd say, I'm going
1226400	1231920	to be honest, I find it quite hard to change my mind. I don't think I could just follow the evidence
1231920	1236400	and just go where it leads. I don't think that's how my mind works. And I think apart from the
1236400	1241280	problem of the fact value distinction, that kind of metaphysical philosophical debate that I spoke
1241280	1247440	about before, I think, you know, reality is human psychology, which simply just don't change our
1247440	1252480	minds like that. And since I used to word psychology, maybe now is a good time to move to a section of
1252480	1256880	this video that's a bit more tolerable. You know, I've been talking about these obstruous philosophies
1256880	1262480	for a while, metaphysics and all that, which can be rather hard to grasp. And you know, let's be
1262480	1269600	honest, you know, in some sense, we are all confined in our way of thinking. We are all confined to,
1269600	1275600	in many ways, we all think the way the Enlightenment philosophers, when I mean we, I mean, we,
1275680	1281920	modern society, we all think the way Enlightenment philosophers told us the thing, that that's how
1281920	1287360	we were told to perceive and understand the world. And as Wittgenstein so brilliantly put it, once
1287360	1293280	you climb up that Wittgensteinian ladder of just philosophy and propositions or rationality, let's
1293280	1299520	say, one must transcend it, one must throw it away and move beyond it. So I'm not going to be
1299520	1303680	transcending that ladder or going to a different philosophy, rather I'll be coming to something
1303680	1308800	a bit more grounded, a topic that I think we can understand a bit more, which is psychology.
1308800	1314480	And that leads me to a point, which I've been trying to understand and probably explicate
1314480	1320320	in some way. It is that utopian thinking, scientific utopianism, any kind of utopian
1320320	1326880	thinking is, psychologically speaking, essentially totalitarian. And understanding why the psychology
1326880	1332880	of utopianism is totalitarian isn't some philosophical game, at least in the analytical
1332880	1341200	sense. It's rather deeply experiential. It's having this unbelievable amount of self-awareness where
1341920	1349520	when one has a thought, where one has an idea or some kind of ideal one striving towards,
1349520	1355920	I think it's really important to be deeply introspective. And I'd even say try and observe
1355920	1362560	oneself without any moral judgment from a third person perspective. See what emotions rise,
1362560	1371120	see what makes me or whoever. Why am I thinking this way? Am I being totalitarian? Am I being
1371120	1376240	absolutist in my quote unquote remedies to the world's problems or my own problems?
1376880	1383680	And I think then we all come to the realization that utopianism is always totalitarian in nature.
1383680	1388000	Because knowing oneself is knowing how one comes to their conclusion. It's good or bad.
1388480	1395360	And what we're capable of doing once we have those conclusions. And to be honest, sometimes
1395360	1401600	that's a deeply terrifying realization. As psychoanalysts have told us, human beings have an innate
1401600	1407680	nature to us. However, this doesn't necessarily mean we're all the same. We differ in our interests,
1407680	1413440	temperaments, proclivities, idiosyncrasies, and certainly physiologically. A manifest example
1413440	1417920	of these differences is shown in the moral foundations theory, popularized in Jonathan
1417920	1422960	Hyde's book, The Righteous Mind. The basic idea of the theory is that our moral intuitions come
1422960	1429200	from certain foundations and concerns, some of these even mutually opposed, that we nonetheless value
1429200	1434320	in informing the moral basis for our beliefs. It could be because of these fundamental differences,
1434320	1439040	we find it difficult to see eye to eye on social, religious, and political matters.
1439040	1443520	And so far, I don't think any of these findings are controversial or worrisome. I don't think we
1443520	1448640	need a thorough knowledge of social psychology to understand that we all differ, even though it
1448640	1453840	might help us empathize more with people of different views to our own, if we know how and why
1453840	1459200	they develop these worldviews. But what deeply perturbs me is the claim Jonathan Hyde makes in
1459200	1465520	his book of social intuitionism, where we form our views through intuition rather than rationality.
1465520	1472160	And furthermore, we actually use rational port to justify our initial belief. Using the elephant
1472160	1477040	and the rider metaphor, he says we don't come to our beliefs through rationality as some of the
1477040	1481040	enlightenment thinkers would like to proclaim. The oldest ideas in intellectual history is the
1481040	1486240	idea that the mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. And wherever you look east
1486240	1490240	or west, there's sort of an idea that there's some sort of higher, more reasoning area and then some
1490320	1499520	sort of lower, more animal-like faculty. Plato gives us many metaphors in the Timaeus. He says
1499520	1504800	that the gods created mankind. They put reason in those orbs, and orbs had a role on the ground,
1504800	1509120	so they had to create the bodies. So that's one metaphor. The other is the phaedrus,
1509120	1514320	reason is the charioteer, and the passions, the noble passions, the base passions, are the horses.
1514320	1518880	And if a man studies philosophy and learns to control those passions, then he can escape the
1518880	1525680	bondage of reincarnation and return to the gods. Now, I think this view, the idea that reason,
1526480	1531200	of course, Plato didn't say that reason is the master in most people, but he said it can be.
1531760	1537040	It is in philosophers, and everyone should strive for it, so he believed it was possible.
1537040	1541040	I think this view of reason has taken quite a beating since the 1990s, certainly from the
1541040	1546000	neuroscientists, who found that when you lose your emotionaries, you don't get hyper-rational.
1546000	1551200	In fact, you either become unable to really think, because reasoning actually depends critically on
1551200	1556160	emotion and intuition, or if you're still able to think at all, you become more like a psychopath
1556160	1561920	who simply doesn't have any emotions in forming his reasoning. So I think the reason as master
1561920	1566320	view has taken quite a beating, and I'll give it more of a beating, model two, the idea that
1566320	1572240	reason is a servant. This is, as you know, the model that I endorse, that reason is a great
1572240	1577840	helper, but it simply is not qualified to lead. But rather than speaking of reason as a slave,
1577840	1583920	which is Hume's word, or a servant, I think if we think about it as a really intelligent servant,
1583920	1587760	really more like a press secretary. This is Robert Gibbs, Obama's first press secretary,
1588480	1594160	and he's a very, very smart guy. They're partners. They work together, but you will never change
1594160	1597920	Obama's mind by convincing his press secretary that something is wrong. That's just not the way
1597920	1603680	the system's designed. So it just structurally can't happen that way. Now, Hume said that the
1603680	1608880	passions were the master. Jesse Prince embraces emotion straight out. He says we can do all
1608880	1612240	this work with emotion. I used to think that in the 90s. I don't think that anymore. I think we
1612240	1616800	really need to talk about intuition more broadly. A lot of the things I've studied have been moral
1616800	1621040	emotions, but as you'll see, there are many cases of gut feelings that aren't exactly emotions.
1622160	1626080	Now, you might say, well, okay, maybe reason's not the master, but it could certainly be an
1626080	1630240	equal partner. And this is the view that Josh Green has and that Darshan Arvayas has. Green
1630240	1637440	gives us the idea of Kant and Mill fighting it out in the brain. Darshan Arvayas uses the
1637440	1641920	metaphor of dancing. Now, it seems to me that if you have dancing, you have one person leading,
1641920	1646080	the other following, but she says, well, it's a different kind of dancing where they take turns.
1646080	1653840	Okay. But even if you downgrade it from master to equal partner, is the evidence that we have on
1653840	1658880	reasoning, is that consistent with reason, even playing an equal partner role? Is reasoning good
1658880	1665440	enough, independent enough to play the role of equal partner? I don't think so. So the science
1665440	1673520	that we hold in such high regard, much like reason is merely a tool to be used by our emotions and
1673520	1677680	intuitions. We may like to think in a sort of blank slate kind of way where these
1678240	1684240	emotionless, intuitionless automatons that simply follow the facts. And once we
1684240	1688400	have all the facts, we come to our conclusions, but we are not. And on a bit of a side note,
1688400	1694560	I personally like the fact that we simply aren't these automatons. I like the fact that
1694560	1699840	we have emotions. We are deeply feeling creatures. We aren't just merely governed by
1699840	1705760	reason alone. Now, I don't have time to get into it, but I would leave a link down below to a great,
1705760	1712960	great essay or story, a sort of allegorical story by Raymond Smully and called A Planet Without
1712960	1718880	Laughter, where he describes the paradox of what it would be like living in a reality
1720000	1724560	where we are only governed by reason. Anyways, I digress. Getting back to the video,
1724560	1730800	the problem now is whatever conclusion that we've come to, we believe that we came to this viewpoint
1730800	1737360	using reason and mere facts alone. And we think that regardless of the consequences,
1737360	1743440	whatever the outcome of our conclusion is, we must push through just by the consequences,
1743440	1748720	because we think the conclusion we have, the viewpoint we hold now, this is absolute truth,
1748720	1754480	because I came to this conclusion based purely on facts. Therefore, I must hold the truth,
1754480	1759840	and it just makes sense to go ahead and let that truth, let's say, actualize in the world.
1759840	1765360	It's in this kind of self-referential, self-fulfilling way of thinking what I mean by
1765360	1772240	totalitarian. It's to bring forth the utopia we will do whatever it takes, because we are 100%
1772240	1778000	absolutely accurate in our conclusions. And in modern times, this torturizing mentality manifests
1778000	1783200	in many ways, but I think the most salient way is in the name of science and reason. It's very
1783200	1789520	common for us to see a Ben Shapiro destroy someone with facts and logic, because he's got the facts,
1789520	1794240	he's got the logic, he's got all the answers. Therefore, he's absolutely right. Ben Shapiro
1794240	1798800	is a right-wing conservative guy, and it's a complete lie that the right wing is anti-science,
1798800	1804000	or the left wing is anti-science, or vice versa, or whatever. None of these sides are anti-science
1804000	1810800	or anti-recent. They're both pro-science and pro-recent, but the problem is they both think
1810800	1816640	that they come to their truth merely by using science and reason alone. But no, both these sides
1816640	1823120	don't come to their conclusions from just facts. They come to their conclusions to keep it a bit
1823120	1829520	more grounded, let's say, at least based on their moral foundations. So science, again, just becomes
1829520	1834640	a means to an end, that end which is created through their moral foundations. And these moral
1834640	1840240	foundations, left-wing, right-wing, conservative, liberal, whatever, doesn't matter. These foundations
1840240	1846480	aren't derived using a scientific method, because they aren't scientific truths and I'd even say
1846480	1851120	science isn't the only way to get at truth. And my fear, of course, is because our society is so
1851120	1858640	deeply, for all it's good, influenced by enlightenment thinking, and both sides, right or left, whatever
1858640	1866240	are influenced by science and reason, there's that aspect of totalitarianism that comes in,
1866880	1872480	and we move towards the dangers of scientific utopianism. You believe in the Crystal Palace,
1872560	1877520	eternally indestructible. That is, one at which you can never stick out your tongue
1877520	1883360	furtively, nor make a rude gesture, even with your fist head in a way. Well, perhaps I'm so afraid
1883360	1888400	of this building precisely because it's made of crystal and it's eternally indestructible,
1888400	1892880	and because it won't be possible to stick out one's tongue even furtively. So what's this Crystal
1892880	1897360	Palace Dostoevsky writes about? It's actually based on a real monument from the 19th century,
1897360	1903200	and I think it's deeply, in a very profound way, pertinent, in a symbolic sense, I'd say,
1903200	1908320	to the society we live in. It was this vast exhibition hall built of glass and iron in London
1908320	1914800	to house this great exhibition of 1851. And for the time, it was very technologically advanced,
1914800	1920080	and anyways, the specificities of it doesn't matter. What matters is, as I said, what it symbolizes.
1920080	1925600	In Russian literature, along with the Industrial Revolution, it symbolizes progress and this
1925600	1930480	move towards the utopian society. There were authors like Shona Shevsky who used it to represent
1930480	1936480	these utopian socialist communes that the people of the future would live in. And of course,
1936480	1942880	Dostoevsky rebukes his claims and says that, no, human beings don't desire utopia,
1942880	1946800	even if there was a utopia, we would end up destroying it because that's not what our heart
1946800	1950160	really wants. You know, my reading of Notes from Underground, which probably is the book
1950160	1954720	that I've read the most in my life, is that I think what Dostoevsky is trying to say is that
1955680	1961440	the human soul, the human beings are obviously very, very incomprehensible beings,
1962240	1969120	and we are all walking paradoxes, you know. In our souls, yes, we want to be safe,
1969120	1974320	we want to be happy and live a good life with well-being and all of that, but at the same time,
1974880	1983040	we also want to be free, in some sense, existentially free, and we would desire being free
1983840	1989920	than over-living in so-called paradises of the utopia. If we do live in a so-called utopian
1989920	1996560	paradise, if we didn't have this freedom of conscience, freedom in our soul to do as we
1996560	2003120	will in that paradise, we would still not prefer that. We'd still rather suffer and be free than
2004000	2007840	not be free and not have any suffering. So before I go on and on about Dostoevsky,
2007840	2012880	which I could do forever because I absolutely love his work, a good question to ask is,
2013760	2018400	why does any of this, the Crystal Palace, all of it, why does it matter to our times?
2018960	2023760	I think it's quite straightforward. It's because what the Crystal Palace represents
2023760	2031360	is the modern AI project, and I think Lex, as much as I love him, very much falls to this car,
2031360	2039280	I guess, trap or this way of thinking about AI the same way maybe thinkers of that time
2039280	2044400	poured about the Crystal Palace. We look to technology to be our savior, we look to AI or
2044400	2052480	whatever it is to be humanity's redeemer, savior, and to be the means that gets us the utopia.
2052480	2058320	Such utopian thinking isn't necessarily a modern phenomenon, nor is it merely a product of scientific
2058320	2064160	advancement. For example, we see forms of it in the Tower of Babel, a very ancient story from the
2064160	2069760	Bible. My point being, it's not the object or theory we project this desire onto that matters,
2069760	2074880	but the psychic phenomena of that desire itself. It doesn't matter if it's the Tower of Babel,
2074880	2080080	Crystal Palace, AI, or Steven Pinker's Enlightenment Rationalism. What we should be
2080080	2086160	attentive towards is the totalizing impulse we have to attribute a certain thing, scientific or not,
2086160	2091440	to be the panacea to all our problems. Furthermore, since utopianism inevitably becomes
2091440	2096960	totalitarian, it is all-encompassing and doesn't leave any room for fragments of being that are
2096960	2102240	outside a given utopian ideology. It's a similar idea that Jordan Peterson and Jonathan Peugeot
2102240	2107600	discussed in a recent podcast about the key difference between heaven and utopia.
2107600	2112720	Heaven is generally conceptualized. You can conceptualize it as a state of being. It might
2112720	2118160	be the state of being that those people that you described live in have had paradisal experiences
2118720	2124400	where everything transformed itself into something that was perfect, that appeared perfect,
2124400	2133760	and I was unable to stay in those frames of mind. The heaven, is that something we build?
2133760	2140000	Is that something? I don't understand the relationship between the heaven that awaits us,
2140000	2145920	let's say, after we die. That's the idea and what we build here on earth. Do those touches?
2146720	2149920	Is that the doctrine? There's so much of this doctrine I don't understand.
2151920	2159200	At all. I think a way to see it has to do with attention again, and it has to do with a hierarchy
2159200	2167200	of attention. If you try to build heaven, you're going to fail. You're going to fail miserably
2167200	2174240	because you're not aiming high enough. You're aiming and then you get stuck in this
2174240	2179360	in these weird world of opposites that you don't even understand the side effects of what you're
2179360	2185680	doing. For one person, heaven will look like if everything could be perfectly ordered then,
2185680	2189680	right, and then we know what that looks like. Another person will look at heaven and think,
2189680	2194640	if everything could be free, we could all just be free and then that we know what that looks like.
2195840	2201520	The idea is to look higher. There's a story that I've been had.
2201600	2205680	We have to strive for something better, but then we end up in, which is what you're saying,
2205680	2209440	is that we end up with the Tower of Babel or we end up with the flood or we end up with
2211680	2215920	the catastrophe, continual catastrophe of unintended consequences. But
2215920	2222800	as you yourself said, we are aiming for something better. The question is, how do you pursue Utopia
2222800	2228480	while avoiding the pitfalls? That's a theological question. Yeah, it is. I think it,
2228480	2234720	I know people are going to hate that I say this, but it has to do with worship. It has to do with
2234720	2241440	what you worship. So if you worship those things that you're aiming towards, the lower things,
2241440	2247200	if you worship the making a safer society, if you worship the making a freer society,
2247200	2252240	if you worship making a stronger society, all of these things are going to go off the rails
2252240	2259600	because they have unintended consequences that you don't understand because they're a fragment
2259600	2264400	of reality. They need to be encompassed together in order to reach something higher.
2265840	2269600	That's the danger of ideology. It's the part that takes the place of the whole.
2272080	2278240	The idea is that if you worship God, then those other things will
2279200	2283920	will kind of lay themselves out slowly and you won't be able to force them. They'll kind of lay
2283920	2288960	themselves out slowly and they'll start to manifest, you know, progressively and as you,
2288960	2294320	but you have to attend to the highest. With scientific utopianism, one value is divinized
2294320	2300560	and science becomes the means to bring forth the ends. The safety, freedom, order, or even
2300560	2306480	technological progress with no regard to any other value, or even the ramifications of said value.
2306480	2310880	And since science itself is only a tool that's malleable and has no way of justifying the
2310880	2317280	means it uses, that one value that all utopians pursue become the only thing that matters.
2317280	2322560	There's no balance, no nuance, no context as utopianism lacks and hierarchy of values.
2323200	2327760	After all, utopia was derived from the Greek meaning nowhere and there probably is a good
2327760	2332800	reason for that. Regardless of our philosophical or religious beliefs, I think a laudable goal for
2332800	2340240	all of us, I'd even say the motivating spirit of the scientific enterprise should be to bring heaven
2340240	2344240	on earth. I truly believe a lot of people, especially those like Lex, who just have a
2344240	2350080	big heart and just truly loves life and humanity and everything that comes along
2350080	2356480	with the baggage of being, let's say. I believe the goal of most scientists and a lot of people
2356480	2362800	is this, it's to make life on earth better. It's the motivating spirit, it's to in some sense,
2362800	2368960	yes, to bring heaven on earth. And this is in no way an anti-science or even worse, an anti-scientist
2368960	2374640	video. I really hope I didn't convey that I was being cynical in that sense because absolutely
2374640	2379360	not. I mean, I work in committee science, I'm a software engineer and my field wouldn't exist if
2379360	2385600	not for this world of science that I review and love so much. I could never forgive myself for such
2386240	2393920	lazy, casual cynicism. Rather, the intent or the purpose of this video was to try and contextualize
2393920	2401280	science. It was to try and understand in the hierarchical topology of epistemology where the
2401280	2407040	science stands. A lot of big words I know, but plainly in a broader culture, what's the role
2407040	2413120	science plays? Because I think by understanding this, we not only make the scientific enterprise,
2413120	2419440	we not only make that a much more fruitful endeavor, but we also make the human experience
2419440	2424800	much more richer and substantial. And Lex, of course, is a good example of what happens when
2424800	2432720	the scientist and the poet meets. So saying all that, please do consider sharing this video with
2432720	2436720	Lex. That would be a dream come true. Thanks for watching.
