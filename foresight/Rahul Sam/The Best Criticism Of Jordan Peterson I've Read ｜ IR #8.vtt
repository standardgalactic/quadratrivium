00:00.000 --> 00:04.340
Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the Interrelant Podcast.

00:04.340 --> 00:12.440
I've got to say, I'm in a really good mood today because I just sat for the AWS developer

00:12.440 --> 00:15.900
associate examination and passed it.

00:15.900 --> 00:16.900
So I'm feeling good.

00:16.900 --> 00:21.740
It's always a good feeling to, you know, work towards something and then kind of achieve

00:21.740 --> 00:25.180
it and well, I guess now what?

00:25.180 --> 00:28.580
Back to the meaninglessness of life.

00:28.580 --> 00:34.520
In any case, this is kind of an interesting episode because the previous episode I did

00:34.520 --> 00:38.860
a few weeks ago was my first ever book review.

00:38.860 --> 00:47.580
And I think this is going to be the first ever article, article or let's say essay commentary.

00:47.580 --> 00:54.980
And it's going to be on the piece that David Dunyong, I really hope I pronounce your surname

00:54.980 --> 00:55.980
right.

00:55.980 --> 00:56.980
David, apologies.

00:56.980 --> 00:59.540
I mean, no disrespect.

00:59.540 --> 01:05.260
It's going to be on the polemical piece that David wrote on Jordan Peterson.

01:05.260 --> 01:12.500
And frankly, from everything I've read on Jordan Peterson, you know, I think today this

01:12.500 --> 01:20.100
is the best criticism I've read of him in a very deep sense, not in like a superficial,

01:20.100 --> 01:25.220
you know, I don't know, the kind of the what like corporate media does, sort of dismissive

01:25.220 --> 01:28.740
calling him a French far right, whatever.

01:28.740 --> 01:37.340
But I really thought David's criticism was very apt to the current situation, but also

01:37.340 --> 01:38.340
just philosophical.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.620
It was quite deep and he made a lot of sense.

01:41.620 --> 01:42.620
And he's a great writer.

01:42.620 --> 01:47.180
I only hope to write like David one day.

01:47.180 --> 01:54.740
Now I've got to say, of course, as I said, this piece is a polemic and like myself, unlike

01:54.740 --> 02:04.140
myself, David is very, very critical of Peterson and doesn't like him at all.

02:04.140 --> 02:08.460
I personally do like Jordan Peterson quite a lot.

02:08.460 --> 02:13.820
I've been influenced by him, especially I'd say when I was about 20, 21, this is like

02:13.820 --> 02:20.380
around 2016, I started watching his lectures early on and I really enjoyed his lectures.

02:20.380 --> 02:28.300
I still very much enjoy the lectures he did on psychologists, like for example, I think

02:28.300 --> 02:33.740
my best learning on John P.J. was through Jordan Peterson.

02:33.740 --> 02:38.940
I'd even say Jordan Peterson was the person who introduced me to Heidegger a couple of

02:38.940 --> 02:43.260
years ago, even though, you know, Peterson doesn't really go into Heidegger's philosophy

02:43.260 --> 02:47.140
kind of, he lectures on him through like a psychological lens.

02:47.140 --> 02:53.860
In any case, the point that I make is that I really like Jordan Peterson.

02:53.860 --> 03:00.620
And that's exactly the reason I think it's important for me to make this episode and

03:00.620 --> 03:06.980
record this and I'm now getting to more as to why that is later on.

03:06.980 --> 03:12.340
So firstly, I want to put a quick caveat as I tend to do with these episodes.

03:12.340 --> 03:20.220
I will truly try and keep away from the day-to-day politics or contemporary issues Peterson gets

03:20.220 --> 03:21.940
himself involved in.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.300
He tends to do that from time to time.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.660
I think he kind of likes it.

03:24.660 --> 03:29.140
Let's be honest, he likes the attention, you know, I mean, I love the doc, but he loves

03:29.140 --> 03:37.700
the attention he gets, but rather in David's paper, I'm going to focus on the philosophical

03:37.700 --> 03:38.700
critiques.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.380
Oh, I didn't mention this.

03:40.380 --> 03:44.780
By the way, how I came across this was actually through David's YouTube channel, Theory and

03:44.780 --> 03:52.980
Philosophy, which I'd say now at this point in my life is my greatest source of learning

03:52.980 --> 04:00.620
when it comes to philosophy and theory, especially being a software engineer, having no background

04:00.620 --> 04:02.940
in arts or the humanities.

04:02.940 --> 04:05.260
I studied computer science.

04:05.260 --> 04:11.300
I didn't even know how to study or learn about all these different theories and philosophies

04:11.300 --> 04:18.540
because I never had any proper formal academic training, even though I deeply love the humanities.

04:18.540 --> 04:20.940
I really appreciate it.

04:20.940 --> 04:21.940
It means a lot to me.

04:21.940 --> 04:26.460
I spend so much of my time trying to understand it and, you know, read philosophy and literature

04:26.460 --> 04:29.140
and all of that.

04:29.140 --> 04:34.660
So I'd say this point in my life without a question, man, David's YouTube channel is

04:35.220 --> 04:38.420
one of my greatest sources of learning.

04:38.420 --> 04:42.420
It's a great resource, really, to go through, virtually any book, I'll go through some of

04:42.420 --> 04:44.980
the stuff he did later on.

04:44.980 --> 04:49.940
Recently I went through his Kant, a critic of pure recent series.

04:49.940 --> 04:55.740
My favorite banan was the one he did on Hannah Arendt.

04:55.740 --> 05:01.060
My God, such a good series, David, really, you just have an amazing ability, you're so

05:01.060 --> 05:02.060
eloquent.

05:03.060 --> 05:09.580
Also, I like that you speak with no pretension, which I appreciate as a layperson or as a

05:09.580 --> 05:10.580
neophyte.

05:10.580 --> 05:16.660
So, sorry, I'm kind of all over the place, but in the preamble, I want to say, as I said,

05:16.660 --> 05:20.700
I try to stick to more of the philosophical critiques, more of the ideological critiques

05:20.700 --> 05:27.780
and not get too enravelled in the kind of day-to-day fleeting politics, let's say.

05:28.780 --> 05:33.060
And, of course, as I said, I'm a big fan of Peterson.

05:33.060 --> 05:40.940
I also like some of the figures in the Intellectual Dark Web, and that begs the question, why should

05:40.940 --> 05:49.220
we be skeptical and question these public intellectuals, people like Sam Harris, Jordan

05:49.220 --> 05:56.820
Peterson, Brett Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, oh God, Harvey Weinstein.

05:56.820 --> 06:03.220
That's funny, what's Brett's brother's name, Eric Weinstein, we should definitely question

06:03.220 --> 06:04.220
Harvey Weinstein.

06:04.220 --> 06:08.420
Ah, right, that was, that was, I swear, that was an intentional, that was just a mistake.

06:08.420 --> 06:14.460
In any case, all these people in the Intellectual Dark Web, why we should question them, and

06:14.460 --> 06:21.220
I think the reason is because, firstly, whenever, personally, whenever I feel that the narratives

06:21.220 --> 06:29.260
that people give out to the world, or the philosophies people propagate and advocate

06:29.260 --> 06:33.820
for, let's say, when they're too coherent, when they're too, let's say, when they're

06:33.820 --> 06:40.300
too much of like a salvation, when they're too redemptive, or when they're too, this

06:40.300 --> 06:44.780
is it, we've got the absolute philosophy, we've got the absolute ideology to make something

06:44.780 --> 06:49.940
work, I generally take a step back and I become a bit skeptical, because for me, you know,

06:49.940 --> 06:55.820
in many ways I'm an absurdist, so there really isn't the kind of coherence that a lot of

06:55.820 --> 07:00.140
the people in the Intellectual Dark Web would like to portray.

07:00.140 --> 07:05.220
And it's actually a point David gets to in his article, which is what I really liked.

07:05.220 --> 07:13.540
So I think whenever we feel like we're getting easy, easy answers, easy solutions, or not

07:13.540 --> 07:22.500
even easy really, but the kind of solutions that seem straightforward without any deeper

07:22.500 --> 07:29.220
introspection and deeper inspection into it, I think we should be skeptical of those kind

07:29.220 --> 07:30.220
of solutions.

07:30.220 --> 07:39.100
And I would say, speaking personally, around two or three years ago, when I really started

07:39.100 --> 07:44.900
to like Jordan Peterson, I realized that I was liking him a bit too much, almost to

07:44.900 --> 07:47.380
the level of obsequiousness.

07:47.380 --> 07:53.380
And that was definitely unhealthy, because I realized, wow, I can't even read an honest

07:53.380 --> 07:58.540
criticism of his work without taking it personally, as if he's some of my personal savior or

07:58.540 --> 07:59.540
whatever.

07:59.540 --> 08:07.140
And, and that's when I truly wanted to only again, treat Jordan Peterson as a person who

08:07.140 --> 08:13.700
influences me, but not as the only point of influence or like this kind of he's in Christ

08:13.700 --> 08:17.860
to put it in a dramatic way.

08:17.860 --> 08:22.300
And that's when I started questioning him a bit more and looking for points of view that

08:22.300 --> 08:28.260
differ from him points of view that, you know, he's completely a versatile, let's say, and

08:28.260 --> 08:35.020
I realized, oh, wow, I actually completely disagree or predominantly with most of his

08:35.020 --> 08:36.020
points.

08:36.020 --> 08:42.620
I disagree with his politics and even his underlying philosophy, despite, and his interesting thing,

08:42.620 --> 08:49.860
despite truly starting to admire and like him as a person, as an individual, as a teacher

08:49.860 --> 08:56.860
and as a psychologist, like I still find his work on psychology to be brilliant.

08:56.860 --> 09:04.420
I think he's a great psychologist, even though I think he's got his politics and his philosophy

09:04.980 --> 09:07.500
and I see a lot of loopholes with his worldview.

09:07.500 --> 09:13.580
And as a person, you know, I've got to say, again, one, one never, one never knows, especially

09:13.580 --> 09:18.780
with public figures, how they portray themselves in public, you know, that kind of distinction

09:18.780 --> 09:24.620
between the private life and the person, between the personal life and the public life.

09:24.620 --> 09:26.340
Peterson looks like a genuine person to me.

09:26.340 --> 09:32.620
He looks sincere and I'm, you know, speaking purely personally, I'm the kind of person

09:33.100 --> 09:39.700
that appreciates family and having a good relationship with your significant other,

09:39.700 --> 09:46.460
your wife, your spouse, whatever, your children, and I find that he's got that kind of relationship

09:46.460 --> 09:52.900
and it seems just that that true love of a family and I appreciate anyone who can foster

09:52.900 --> 09:59.300
that and who can have that in life because that certainly takes work.

09:59.300 --> 10:06.620
So yeah, those are the points of the preamble and that, of course, leads me to this point

10:06.620 --> 10:10.460
and I wasn't even going to put this part in the episode, but I realized that actually

10:10.460 --> 10:15.780
maybe it's something I should talk about before I get to the article itself.

10:15.780 --> 10:20.900
I still don't know if David Steeleman or Strowman, Peterson's arguments.

10:20.900 --> 10:25.940
I don't know if he mischaracterized him and whether he, how he portrayed Peterson's

10:25.980 --> 10:33.940
oppositions to Bill C-16, got to keep in mind David too is a philosophy student.

10:33.940 --> 10:37.220
I think he's doing a PhD in philosophy.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.580
Anyway, he's an art student.

10:38.580 --> 10:45.900
So, you know, I don't want to make an argument from authority, but I do think someone who's

10:45.900 --> 10:51.660
taken the time to go and study theory and go and study philosophy in academia.

10:51.740 --> 10:57.300
I sell whole academia in high regard, contrary to most people on the internet.

10:57.300 --> 11:01.740
And I would say a person like that probably has a better understanding of some of the

11:01.740 --> 11:08.940
intricacies of these debates when it comes to free speech, pronouns, all the different

11:08.940 --> 11:13.820
fragments that are connected in the whole Bill C-16 controversy.

11:13.820 --> 11:19.940
So I didn't get the impression that David was trying to mischaracterize Peterson, but

11:19.940 --> 11:26.700
also that's the one reason for that is because sometimes Peterson himself isn't coherent

11:26.700 --> 11:31.380
with what his arguments are in his opposition to Bill C-16.

11:31.380 --> 11:37.540
He will say it's a purely free speech issue, but then you can see from some of the interviews,

11:37.540 --> 11:41.700
which is the interview that I'm going to play right now, that it's no, no, it's not just

11:41.700 --> 11:42.700
a free speech issue.

11:42.700 --> 11:46.140
He's got an issue with the gender identification too.

11:46.140 --> 11:52.660
So without me putting words in his mouth, let's listen to this short clip that I found

11:52.660 --> 12:01.580
on Majid Nawaz's show where, I mean, this was in 2018, so a bit after the whole controversy

12:01.580 --> 12:03.580
broke out.

12:03.580 --> 12:08.260
And I think this is the most, this is the shortest clip I could find where Peterson lays

12:08.260 --> 12:15.180
down his points, kind of enumerates all his points as to why he opposes Bill C-16.

12:15.180 --> 12:17.500
So let's take a look.

12:17.500 --> 12:23.700
Bill C-16 purported to do nothing but extend human rights provisions to an excluded group,

12:23.700 --> 12:28.220
let's say, to the transgender and non-gender binary types.

12:28.220 --> 12:30.700
And that was the federal legislation.

12:30.700 --> 12:36.540
It also made it a hate crime to discriminate or harass, essentially.

12:36.540 --> 12:40.460
So now then the question is, well, what exactly do you mean by discriminate or harass?

12:40.460 --> 12:43.580
And why exactly is that a hate crime under the criminal code?

12:43.580 --> 12:45.740
Well, there was an answer to that.

12:45.740 --> 12:50.420
The answer was, well, this bill will be interpreted in light of the policies generated by the

12:50.420 --> 12:53.540
Ontario Human Rights Commission, very large set of policies.

12:53.540 --> 12:57.180
Now the Ontario Human Rights Commission is a radically leftist organization.

12:57.180 --> 13:00.940
I think it's the most dangerous organization in Canada, although you could debate that.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.460
Of course, I've got to make a comment.

13:02.460 --> 13:06.180
So I'm going to make comments in the middle of what he's saying.

13:06.180 --> 13:09.820
I mean, if you want to watch the whole thing without me interrupting, just go and watch

13:09.820 --> 13:10.820
the original video.

13:10.820 --> 13:17.020
But you see, this is another thing what Peter said, as much as I like him, you know, when

13:17.020 --> 13:22.420
he makes a statement, such a blatant statement that the Ontario Human Rights Commission is

13:22.420 --> 13:27.380
the most dangerous organization in all of Canada.

13:27.380 --> 13:35.060
That's where, you know, touching on my earlier point, one should take a step back and, oh,

13:35.060 --> 13:36.060
is it really?

13:36.060 --> 13:37.660
Like, what does he mean by that?

13:37.660 --> 13:44.540
The most dangerous, that's quite a leap to call an organization the most dangerous organization

13:44.540 --> 13:46.820
in all of Canada.

13:46.820 --> 13:51.420
This is where I think we should pause the video because it's normally on YouTube that

13:51.420 --> 13:56.940
he's popular and actually think and not let him, when I mean him, I mean, Peterson or

13:56.940 --> 14:00.260
anyone for that matter do the thinking for us.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.100
So back to the video.

14:02.100 --> 14:07.460
Debate that and they said all sorts of policies about how this legislation was going to be

14:07.460 --> 14:13.540
interpreted and the federal government linked to their website to state that Bill C16 would

14:13.540 --> 14:15.580
be interpreted in light of those guidelines.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.540
So I went and read all the policies.

14:17.540 --> 14:22.860
Well one of the policies was that if you didn't use the preferred pronouns of a given group

14:22.860 --> 14:26.620
that you could be charged essentially with a hate crime.

14:26.620 --> 14:27.620
And I thought, no.

14:27.620 --> 14:28.620
Which given group is that?

14:28.620 --> 14:29.780
You mean talking about transgender people?

14:29.780 --> 14:30.780
Yeah.

14:30.780 --> 14:32.100
And so there's all these pronouns that have come up.

14:32.100 --> 14:37.420
There's 70 different sets of pronouns approximately to hypothetically describe people who don't

14:37.540 --> 14:41.740
fit anywhere on the gender spectrum, which is also something that I don't really understand.

14:41.740 --> 14:43.740
I don't understand that conceptually.

14:43.740 --> 14:45.240
We'll come to that.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.340
But I just want to hear the story of this bill first.

14:47.340 --> 14:48.340
Well, okay.

14:48.340 --> 14:53.300
So now a person is compelled under Canadian law to use the pronoun of another individual's

14:53.300 --> 14:55.900
choice by on pain of law.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.420
And I thought, well no, that's not acceptable.

14:58.420 --> 15:02.540
It's one thing to put limits on what a person can't say, like say with hate speech laws,

15:02.540 --> 15:04.500
which I also don't agree with by the way.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.980
But that's a different argument.

15:06.060 --> 15:08.060
I think it's a narrower argument.

15:08.060 --> 15:14.300
But to compel me to use a certain content when I'm formulating my thoughts or my actions

15:14.300 --> 15:18.060
under threat of legislative action, I thought, no, what's happened there is the government

15:18.060 --> 15:21.580
has introduced compelled speech legislation into the private sphere.

15:21.580 --> 15:24.220
It's never happened in the history of English common law.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.340
And so I said, there's no way I'm abiding by that.

15:26.340 --> 15:28.260
I don't care what your damn rationale is.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.260
We're compassionate.

15:29.260 --> 15:30.500
It's like, no, you're not.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.500
No, you're not.

15:31.500 --> 15:35.060
You're playing this radical collectivist left wing game.

15:35.060 --> 15:41.380
You're trying to gain linguistic supremacy in the area of public discourse.

15:41.380 --> 15:44.980
You're doing that using compassion as a guise and you're pulling the wool over people's

15:44.980 --> 15:47.580
eyes and you're not going to do it with me.

15:47.580 --> 15:52.340
If I was sitting here in front of you as a transgendered male to female or female to

15:52.340 --> 15:56.700
male and we began the conversation at the beginning of the conversation you stumbled

15:56.700 --> 16:01.620
and called me he or she and I was perhaps identifying the other way around.

16:01.620 --> 16:04.660
And then if I'd said to you, please, I'd rather go by she.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.540
How would you respond to that on a personal level?

16:06.540 --> 16:08.460
Well, it would depend on the situation.

16:08.460 --> 16:12.780
But the way I have responded to that because I've had a number of conversations with transgendered

16:12.780 --> 16:17.420
individuals is that I use whatever pronoun seems to go along with the persona that they're

16:17.420 --> 16:18.900
projecting publicly.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.740
It's the simplest thing to do.

16:20.740 --> 16:24.660
Now, if we were if you would respect their choice on an individual level.

16:24.660 --> 16:31.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but with a with a with a more contentious pronouns, G insurer and

16:31.300 --> 16:33.860
that sort of thing, that's a whole different issue.

16:33.860 --> 16:37.460
Because the question there is, well, exactly what is it that you're doing when you're

16:37.460 --> 16:39.300
asking me to use those words?

16:39.300 --> 16:43.180
Like are you are you compelling me to play your particular ideological game?

16:43.180 --> 16:46.500
Or is this actually a matter of some personal identity that's important to you?

16:46.500 --> 16:48.340
And those things are not obvious.

16:48.340 --> 16:52.820
And so in a situation like that, the first thing I'd have to do is to try to figure out

16:52.820 --> 16:56.380
just exactly what was going on in the situation and that's not simple.

16:56.380 --> 17:00.500
And so there would be no foregone conclusion that I would address you by the pronouns

17:00.500 --> 17:01.500
of your choice.

17:01.860 --> 17:05.380
The first thing I'd want to find out is, is that just a narcissistic power play?

17:05.580 --> 17:07.460
Because that's actually the most likely outcome.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.460
I don't know if that's the most likely outcome.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.180
And, you know, Peterson does make a good point.

17:12.180 --> 17:20.100
Like, again, there are manipulative, almost psychopathic narcissists in this world who

17:20.100 --> 17:24.540
want to manipulate people and play power games.

17:24.540 --> 17:27.420
So that certainly is the case.

17:27.420 --> 17:33.860
But again, this is, OK, so I've got a few points to make on what Peterson just said.

17:34.060 --> 17:40.860
On what Majid Nawaz said about on a personal level, that's an important word he's

17:41.060 --> 17:43.700
personal. I think a lot of this comes down to that.

17:43.900 --> 17:48.180
It comes down to those interpersonal relations and how we treat each other.

17:48.380 --> 17:52.500
We can't bureaucratize it, even though I feel like

17:52.660 --> 17:58.900
modern society is trying to, in many ways,

17:59.100 --> 18:05.740
everything is everything is abstracted out into the into the ether, into the bureaucracy,

18:05.940 --> 18:10.420
you know, into like the Kafkaist bureaucracy, and then even things that are so intimate

18:10.620 --> 18:14.100
and so personal, modernity is bureaucratizing it.

18:14.300 --> 18:18.660
And it's kind of unfortunate because a lot of this, which should be dealt at an

18:18.660 --> 18:27.660
individual level is trying to be dealt with with laws and policies, which,

18:27.860 --> 18:29.340
frankly, I don't think works.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.140
I don't firstly, it's not authentic.

18:31.340 --> 18:36.420
And secondly, this practically, I think it fails.

18:36.620 --> 18:41.740
And then on the point Peterson makes about what kind of game you're playing.

18:41.740 --> 18:45.900
So you can clearly see that for him, it's not just a free speech issue,

18:46.140 --> 18:48.940
a gender issue, just play a factor.

18:49.140 --> 18:54.340
And he also is particularly averse to people who are gender fluid or people who are

18:54.540 --> 18:58.940
non-binary, you can see that he doesn't, he doesn't click for him.

18:59.140 --> 19:00.580
He can't comprehend what that means.

19:00.780 --> 19:02.900
And, you know, fair enough, I mean,

19:03.100 --> 19:07.780
to a certain extent, I never really had a problem with the whole gender fluid thing.

19:07.980 --> 19:14.060
I always felt deep down in a very visceral sense that, yeah, gender certainly doesn't

19:14.100 --> 19:16.300
seem something that's binary.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.100
It doesn't seem like something that's fixed.

19:19.300 --> 19:22.740
In fact, I don't think human nature is fixed.

19:22.940 --> 19:27.420
I think human nature is way more dynamic than we think.

19:27.620 --> 19:31.180
It's a lot more deeper than what,

19:31.380 --> 19:35.980
you know, in modernity, the post enlightenment era, we would like to put

19:36.180 --> 19:38.900
everything in comfortable boxes.

19:39.100 --> 19:42.100
It's a human nature is a lot more deeper than that, in my opinion.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.340
And David kind of touches on that in his article, too.

19:45.540 --> 19:51.780
But also his thing about, see, this is where, again, I don't know whether

19:51.980 --> 19:56.260
Peterson does a good job and how he articulates his points.

19:56.460 --> 20:01.820
Because it seems a bit vitriolic or it seems a bit hateful the way he

20:02.020 --> 20:04.420
talks about non-binary people.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.260
Again, you know, these are just I'm just touching on my intuitions.

20:07.260 --> 20:11.220
I'm not saying this is exactly what he's saying, not at all.

20:11.460 --> 20:16.740
You know, when he says are non-binary people playing some kind of

20:16.940 --> 20:21.580
narcissistic power player or trying to manipulate other people.

20:21.780 --> 20:24.140
Personally, for my experience,

20:24.340 --> 20:27.460
I've actually I've only really got one non-binary friend, because all of my

20:27.660 --> 20:32.020
other friends are transgender, which means all the other friends in the LGBTQ community,

20:32.220 --> 20:36.260
I mean, which means, you know, they still identify just by the opposite gender,

20:36.460 --> 20:37.620
not the one that was assigned it.

20:37.620 --> 20:39.060
But then, you know, that's that's fine.

20:39.100 --> 20:44.260
And some of them, one of them, actually, I don't even know until she told me.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.820
In any case, the non-binary people, yeah, it is a bit odd.

20:48.020 --> 20:51.740
I'm going to be totally honest, referring someone as they.

20:51.940 --> 20:57.220
But this person that I do know, in no way did I get the impression that this person

20:57.420 --> 21:02.860
was playing some kind of game or this person was trying to manipulate me to,

21:03.060 --> 21:08.020
you know, as Peterson says, is trying to control my linguistic territory.

21:08.220 --> 21:09.660
I didn't get that impression at all.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.740
And if I did, I wouldn't be that person's friend.

21:11.940 --> 21:15.060
I wouldn't associate that person simple as that.

21:15.260 --> 21:20.020
And I think person genuinely didn't feel like a man or a woman or felt non-binary,

21:20.020 --> 21:20.700
whatever that means.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.660
I don't know what that means, because I don't feel like that.

21:22.860 --> 21:25.820
And that's something we've got to learn about.

21:26.020 --> 21:32.580
Even he, you know, about life itself, that in some sense, you know,

21:32.780 --> 21:35.820
this is apocryphally attributed to character God.

21:35.820 --> 21:39.380
But, you know, when you label me, you negate me, I think it comes

21:39.580 --> 21:43.620
from this character God's idea that in many ways, that deep

21:43.820 --> 21:47.980
inanness, that subjectivity of being human,

21:48.180 --> 21:49.700
that it can never be quantified.

21:49.900 --> 21:56.300
It can never be properly betrayed or abstracted out from the individual.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.500
No one will ever know what it feels like to be me.

21:59.700 --> 22:04.540
Nor will I ever know what it feels like to be some other specific individual,

22:04.820 --> 22:08.060
not an abstract humanity, no, no, no, a specific individual.

22:08.060 --> 22:11.100
And that's for me, you know, my thinking has been heavily influenced

22:11.300 --> 22:13.220
by character God in that way.

22:13.420 --> 22:17.340
And, you know, far enough, Peterson, too, you know, talks a lot about character God.

22:17.540 --> 22:21.660
So saying all that with that long preamble, good Lord, it's 20 minutes already.

22:21.660 --> 22:24.700
And I haven't even got to David's article yet.

22:24.900 --> 22:27.620
Let's discuss David's piece.

22:27.820 --> 22:29.780
The article is titled

22:29.940 --> 22:34.380
Jordan Peterson and the flow of scientific inquiry,

22:34.580 --> 22:40.060
a critical evaluation of Peterson's use of science and philosophy

22:40.260 --> 22:46.060
in his conquest against social justice by David Gagnon.

22:46.260 --> 22:47.780
Again, I'm so sorry if I got to say

22:47.980 --> 22:50.980
him wrong, David, I truly mean no disrespect.

22:51.180 --> 22:56.380
So the article starts off by two quotes by Baudrillard and Nietzsche.

22:56.580 --> 22:58.820
And I also want to say

22:59.020 --> 23:04.500
I only knew of Baudrillard as his name in the French intellectual circles.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.580
It's because of David that I've actually truly kind of

23:07.780 --> 23:10.500
delved into his work a bit more and started to understand him.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.780
So again, as I said, David's YouTube channel has had a YouTube channel,

23:13.980 --> 23:15.940
has had what kind of speak?

23:16.140 --> 23:20.180
David's YouTube channel has had a massive influence

23:20.380 --> 23:21.980
on me in the past year or so.

23:22.180 --> 23:24.060
So I'm truly grateful for that, David.

23:24.260 --> 23:27.500
OK, back to the article.

23:28.460 --> 23:33.020
If all enigmas are resolved, the stars go out.

23:33.220 --> 23:36.660
If everything's secret is returned to the visible,

23:36.860 --> 23:40.620
if all illusion is returned to transparent,

23:40.820 --> 23:44.580
then heaven becomes become indifferent to the earth.

23:44.780 --> 23:48.020
Jean Baudrillard, what is the purpose?

23:48.220 --> 23:52.380
And worst still, what is the origin of all science?

23:52.540 --> 23:59.420
What is scientific method, perhaps no more than fear

23:59.620 --> 24:05.300
of and flight from pessimism, a cycle of defense against truth?

24:05.500 --> 24:11.220
Or to put it in moral terms, is it something like cowardice and insincerity?

24:11.420 --> 24:14.300
To put it immorally, is it a form of cunning?

24:14.500 --> 24:19.060
Oh, Socrates Socrates, was that perhaps your secret?

24:19.220 --> 24:24.580
Oh, mysterious ironies versus perhaps your irony?

24:24.780 --> 24:26.580
Fredric Nietzsche.

24:27.940 --> 24:30.100
David starts off the article saying,

24:30.300 --> 24:35.180
this article argues that Peterson's challenge to postmodern port

24:35.380 --> 24:38.620
as an anti-scientific doctrine is perplexing,

24:38.820 --> 24:43.020
given the general general lack of consensus between his views

24:43.220 --> 24:46.420
and those of the greater scientific community.

24:46.580 --> 24:50.740
The article presents different theoretical frameworks attesting

24:50.940 --> 24:54.100
to the reality of gender non-conforming identities,

24:54.300 --> 24:58.460
as well as to the consequences of denying these identities.

24:58.660 --> 25:04.020
And argues that rather than challenging oppressive systems of governance,

25:04.220 --> 25:07.860
Peterson's project actually mirrors them.

25:08.660 --> 25:10.700
So pretty much the article breaks down

25:10.900 --> 25:14.460
JB's project into three broad conceptual domains.

25:14.500 --> 25:18.380
The three of them are the first one's arguments about postmodernism.

25:18.580 --> 25:23.820
So Peterson's averseness against postmodernism and how he portrays postmodernism.

25:24.020 --> 25:27.740
And of course, the most interesting part, in my opinion, that I had,

25:27.940 --> 25:32.020
I learned a lot from this part, really, the part where David touches

25:32.220 --> 25:36.300
on the scientific discourse, truth and objectivity.

25:36.500 --> 25:39.220
Brilliant, brilliant section of the article.

25:39.420 --> 25:43.340
And the other part is the more of the political part, let's say,

25:44.020 --> 25:45.380
on gender identity.

25:45.580 --> 25:48.140
Now, I'll focus on the latter.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.580
Sorry, I'll focus on the former,

25:50.780 --> 25:54.660
the arguments about postmodernism and the scientific discourse, truth and

25:54.860 --> 25:59.100
objectivity parts over the latter, which is the gender identity part, simply because

25:59.300 --> 26:03.660
for me, I don't know if I'm speaking from a position of privilege here,

26:03.660 --> 26:07.060
but I didn't really care too much about the whole gender identity issue,

26:07.260 --> 26:09.180
because it didn't really personally affect me.

26:09.380 --> 26:12.700
And even in this article, that was the part that I sort of

26:12.860 --> 26:16.660
I did read it a couple of times for this video, but just skimmed over.

26:16.860 --> 26:19.420
It didn't really speak to me in a deeper sense.

26:19.620 --> 26:24.860
But certainly, the poems David make are quite interesting, especially when he

26:25.060 --> 26:28.180
speaks of Judith Butler and Baudrillard.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.020
I'm going to get to that part a bit later,

26:30.220 --> 26:33.180
but I do recommend reading the whole thing, of course, because unlike a book,

26:33.180 --> 26:36.780
this is an article, so you could just read it in one sitting.

26:37.700 --> 26:40.180
David David states,

26:40.380 --> 26:45.500
this article presents counter arguments and evidence that destabilized the

26:45.700 --> 26:50.580
facile deployment of a scientific rationality by Peterson and his allies,

26:50.780 --> 26:55.300
and therefore calls into question many of his central claims.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.660
This paper moves through each of these domains

26:58.860 --> 27:03.340
methodically, beginning with his juxtaposition of postmodernism with

27:03.460 --> 27:10.180
neo-Marxism, all the while claiming to be a faithful reader to Frederick Nietzsche.

27:10.380 --> 27:15.060
That point there, all the while claiming to be a faithful reader to Frederick

27:15.260 --> 27:17.780
Nietzsche is an important one, because

27:17.980 --> 27:21.580
maybe I'll get to that later on in detail, but

27:21.780 --> 27:23.500
if someone

27:23.700 --> 27:29.620
listens to Peterson's lectures and then gets this impression of who Nietzsche is

27:29.780 --> 27:33.900
and then actually reads Nietzsche,

27:34.100 --> 27:36.980
in my opinion, at least, it's a completely different.

27:37.180 --> 27:41.100
So the contradiction is very evident,

27:41.300 --> 27:45.500
because the actual Nietzsche is very much different to the kind of Nietzsche

27:45.700 --> 27:47.260
Peterson portrays, in my opinion.

27:47.260 --> 27:48.740
So that's an important one.

27:48.740 --> 27:51.860
And I thought that was a good point, David, raised in this article.

27:52.060 --> 27:53.740
This is something I started feeling

27:53.940 --> 27:57.540
about two years ago when I actually started reading Nietzsche's work,

27:57.740 --> 28:01.020
especially the gay science

28:01.220 --> 28:03.460
and the anger and evil.

28:03.660 --> 28:05.060
So

28:05.260 --> 28:09.060
anyway, that's an interesting thing to think about.

28:09.260 --> 28:12.100
Of course, I also found there's a problem with

28:12.300 --> 28:20.140
Peterson's sort of prima facie associating postmodernism with totalitarianism.

28:20.340 --> 28:24.420
And I think David, again, brings this point to Salience, too.

28:24.500 --> 28:27.500
And furthermore, the kind of the

28:27.700 --> 28:33.660
incommensurability between neo-Marxism, which is a metanarrative and postmodernism.

28:33.860 --> 28:39.380
You know, David asks, is it true that postmodernism is merely a clever Marxist

28:39.580 --> 28:47.140
side of hand seeking like its Marxist predecessor to undermine the West?

28:47.340 --> 28:50.140
Well, again, if you listen to

28:50.140 --> 28:52.300
Peterson, that's the impression you get.

28:52.500 --> 29:01.940
But if you do a bit more excavating into, let's say, the over of postmodern

29:02.140 --> 29:04.340
philosophy and literature, which is

29:04.540 --> 29:08.940
virtually an impossible task, because there's so much.

29:09.140 --> 29:11.020
You might get a different impression.

29:11.220 --> 29:16.660
But even if you read the, let's say, the well known postmodernist or the kind

29:16.700 --> 29:19.900
of postmodernist Peterson talks about like Derrida and Foucault,

29:20.100 --> 29:23.700
you'd find that, oh, actually, no, you know, it's not easy to just pinpoint them

29:23.900 --> 29:28.860
as Marxist. I mean, Foucault was an anarchist, for God's sake.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.100
And then.

29:31.300 --> 29:35.260
This is again is a good point I've spoken about as before in my previous episodes.

29:35.460 --> 29:37.300
And David certainly puts in a much more

29:37.500 --> 29:41.180
articulate and eloquent manner than I have ever done.

29:41.420 --> 29:45.180
Scientific rationality is fragile and we can't

29:45.380 --> 29:50.540
unequivocally place faith on the science.

29:50.740 --> 29:54.300
I'm pretty in quotes because the science is a very

29:54.500 --> 29:58.660
determined with a lot of baggage, the science.

29:58.860 --> 30:04.940
We can't put this kind of faith of science being universal,

30:05.140 --> 30:07.180
a historical, a cultural.

30:07.380 --> 30:09.740
And most certainly when we take the scientific

30:10.500 --> 30:13.220
constitution, we can't derive social values from it.

30:13.420 --> 30:18.020
That's a good point David makes using Baudrillard.

30:18.220 --> 30:21.580
And I was thinking about this recently.

30:21.780 --> 30:25.540
The intellectual dark web, Peterson, all these, I mean, I know the intellectual

30:25.740 --> 30:30.700
dark web doesn't really exist anymore, but people, you know, from that elk

30:30.900 --> 30:35.060
would agree with this statement, I think, especially with what happened with covid

30:35.060 --> 30:40.140
because most of most of them were involved with all these controversies

30:40.340 --> 30:46.380
regarding the lockdowns as in the midst of covid, the lockdowns, the vaccinations.

30:46.580 --> 30:52.140
And they would agree that science isn't this

30:52.340 --> 30:56.620
entity, let's say, that you could just detach or science isn't this thing that

30:56.820 --> 31:00.660
can just plainly be detached from the rest of society.

31:00.860 --> 31:05.300
And from our, from our, let's say, our perspectives.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.820
I don't know if anything really

31:08.020 --> 31:11.620
being a human being, you know, this is again, Nietzsche's perspectivism.

31:11.820 --> 31:13.620
Being a human being, I don't know if you can really

31:13.820 --> 31:15.580
detach anything from a perspective.

31:15.780 --> 31:18.100
So from a from the context, from a social context.

31:18.300 --> 31:23.420
And this, again, is something I've truly begun to appreciate about postmodernist

31:23.620 --> 31:27.700
that kind of skepticism, even though I understand that can easily become

31:27.740 --> 31:29.220
a cynicism.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.980
And that certainly isn't what I'm trying to do here,

31:32.180 --> 31:36.220
even though maybe sometimes in this article, David has become a bit cynical,

31:36.220 --> 31:36.820
but that's fine.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.740
You know, we all can become,

31:38.940 --> 31:43.380
life is tough, being cynical sometimes is warranted.

31:43.580 --> 31:47.980
So the section that we're going to get to right now is the

31:48.180 --> 31:52.580
incommensurability of Marxism and postmodernism.

31:52.780 --> 31:57.380
The point David makes is simply it's wrong to claim postmodernists are

31:57.460 --> 31:59.260
Marxists in disguise.

31:59.460 --> 32:02.260
It's too simplistic and it's a lazy argument.

32:02.460 --> 32:04.500
And David pointed out in this article,

32:04.700 --> 32:10.140
Clare Hemmings problem problematizes this approach to postmodernism and Marxism

32:10.340 --> 32:12.740
by emphasizing some of the most significant

32:12.940 --> 32:16.220
differences between the two theoretical frameworks.

32:16.420 --> 32:21.500
She writes that postmodernism's attention to complexity of meaning and

32:21.500 --> 32:27.780
interpretation distracted us from the most substantive concerns with inequality,

32:27.980 --> 32:33.780
experience, political economy and justice that Marxism attains to.

32:33.980 --> 32:38.900
Hemmings extends this analysis by suggesting that without a Marxist or

32:39.100 --> 32:42.300
other tangible approach to critical theory,

32:42.500 --> 32:46.820
we remain powerless to alter the pernicious

32:46.980 --> 32:51.940
power relations or poststructuralist tactics can cleverly identify,

32:52.140 --> 32:54.620
but spectacularly fail to transform.

32:54.820 --> 33:01.540
Hemmings's point stresses the lack of consistency between Marxist and poststructuralists theories,

33:01.740 --> 33:08.220
demonstrating their fundamental incongruency in the domain of political action.

33:08.420 --> 33:13.740
With the former emphasizing a radical transformation of capitalism into a

33:13.860 --> 33:19.740
socialist system and the latter belonging to the domain of theory interested in the

33:19.940 --> 33:24.140
immaterial conditions of signification.

33:24.340 --> 33:30.940
What I got from this parallel was, you know, in a very colloquial sense, let's say,

33:31.140 --> 33:34.940
Marxism is predominantly a call to political and social action.

33:35.140 --> 33:38.140
You know, that's what the communist manifesto is pretty much is,

33:38.140 --> 33:42.220
even though I'm not reducing Marxism just to the communist manifesto, certainly not.

33:42.420 --> 33:48.900
But it seems clear to me, at least, as a, again, a layperson on your side,

33:49.100 --> 33:52.900
that Marxism is clearly a call to action.

33:53.100 --> 33:57.540
Anyone who, in my opinion, is a Marxist is sort of

33:57.740 --> 34:00.940
is a concomitantly an activist.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.500
There's no,

34:03.700 --> 34:06.500
in my opinion, these come together,

34:06.700 --> 34:12.060
the couple, let's say, whereas postmodernism and poststructuralism is very much

34:12.260 --> 34:17.620
a theory, it's against what Clare Hemings writes about,

34:17.820 --> 34:21.100
identifies here of it being

34:21.300 --> 34:25.100
the importance of context, the depths and layers of meaning, all of that.

34:25.300 --> 34:28.300
So it's breaking down language.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.180
So it is different.

34:30.380 --> 34:35.580
One can't just, again, as I said, prima facie attribute a postmodernist to also be

34:35.780 --> 34:41.020
a Marxist or put it in a Petersonian way to say that postmodernism is a slight

34:41.060 --> 34:43.580
of hand for Marxism.

34:43.780 --> 34:48.060
And then David writes on Jean Baudrillard.

34:48.260 --> 34:54.420
Jean Baudrillard referred to by some as the high priest of postmodernism is one

34:54.620 --> 35:01.980
such figure that greatly disturbs Peterson's conflation of Marxist and postmodern theories.

35:02.180 --> 35:08.220
In the mirror of production, Baudrillard vehemently challenges Marxism asking,

35:08.420 --> 35:14.060
are we quite simply within a mode of production at all?

35:14.260 --> 35:17.340
And have we ever been in one?

35:17.540 --> 35:22.900
Baudrillard extends this question by turning his critical gaze back on Marxism,

35:23.100 --> 35:28.180
suggesting that Marxism is predicated on the fundamentally, this is an important

35:28.380 --> 35:33.300
point, on the fundamentally Eurocentric tenants of Productivism,

35:33.420 --> 35:40.060
scientism and historicism, and that it homogenizes

35:40.260 --> 35:47.220
earlier societies under the light of the present structure of the capitalist economy.

35:47.420 --> 35:52.340
Therefore, silencing specific socio-historical contexts,

35:52.540 --> 35:57.580
projecting onto them the spectral light of political economy.

35:57.780 --> 36:00.380
Oh, that was a bit dense.

36:00.660 --> 36:04.060
This book marked a fundamental turning point

36:04.260 --> 36:09.820
in Baudrillard's work as he grew wary of the possibility that Marxism could

36:10.020 --> 36:15.180
actually provide the blueprints for an effective mode of societal change.

36:15.380 --> 36:21.420
I would say as much as as much as as much of an anti-capitalist that I've become,

36:21.620 --> 36:26.900
and especially in the past, say, years, so I've truly seen a lot of loopholes

36:27.020 --> 36:30.820
and a lot of problems with modernity and capitalism.

36:31.020 --> 36:34.940
The reason I'm still not a Marxist or I probably will never be one is because

36:35.140 --> 36:41.540
of this coin David makes, but only Baudrillard makes, that

36:41.740 --> 36:43.140
they're too materialistic.

36:43.340 --> 36:49.060
For me, Marxism is too, it's too contemporary in that sense.

36:49.260 --> 36:50.860
It's too ephemeral.

36:51.060 --> 36:56.020
It doesn't look into the deeper realities of society and being human.

36:56.220 --> 36:59.260
And again, it's too.

37:00.700 --> 37:04.180
It's too, let's say, you know, I mean, there's even a term called scientific.

37:04.380 --> 37:07.500
Is it called scientific socialism or scientific utopianism?

37:07.700 --> 37:13.660
So a lot of it's heavily influenced by this post enlightenment kind of thought.

37:13.860 --> 37:17.340
And it it tends to ignore so much.

37:17.340 --> 37:20.660
And I want to mean it, I should say it's this is both capitalism and Marxism

37:20.860 --> 37:25.020
tends to ignore human psychology, culture, sociology.

37:25.300 --> 37:33.060
Therefore, Baudrillard makes a brilliant, perspicacious point here that

37:33.260 --> 37:36.460
shouldn't shouldn't we be a bit critical of these

37:36.660 --> 37:38.940
prescriptions we are making on society.

37:39.140 --> 37:41.940
And we're saying that this will work.

37:42.140 --> 37:45.260
And then David makes a comment on Foucault

37:45.460 --> 37:50.260
in the order of things he systematically, when you mean he is Michel Foucault,

37:50.460 --> 37:54.980
in the order of things he systematically avoids discussing Marxism.

37:55.180 --> 38:01.140
In terms of economic theory in favor of many other liberal approaches to economics

38:01.340 --> 38:05.900
indicative of the work of Adam Smith and Francois Canet.

38:06.100 --> 38:08.740
Foucault does this because as he makes

38:08.940 --> 38:14.100
abundantly clear, he believes that Marxism exists in 19th century thought

38:14.300 --> 38:19.100
like a fish in water, that that is, it is unable to breathe anywhere else.

38:19.300 --> 38:22.500
Foucault might the point that I was trying to make before in a much better way.

38:22.780 --> 38:25.780
This is exactly what I was trying to say.

38:25.980 --> 38:30.820
This sentiment resonates in harmony with the overarching themes

38:31.020 --> 38:36.260
of his work, because he refuses to acknowledge that societal ills or power

38:36.460 --> 38:40.140
can be reduced to a single structural locus.

38:40.340 --> 38:45.340
What I read this point for a moment, I thought this was Peterson writing because

38:45.540 --> 38:50.740
Peterson has made strikingly similar points to that which Foucault makes,

38:50.780 --> 38:56.020
especially when he speaks of ideology, that the fragment can replace the whole,

38:56.220 --> 39:00.220
that ideology only sees part of the picture.

39:00.420 --> 39:06.780
So in that sense, Peterson would 100 percent agree with Foucault here.

39:06.980 --> 39:12.060
Well, not 100 percent, because, you know, nothing works in absolutes.

39:12.260 --> 39:14.180
But the point I'm trying to make is that

39:14.380 --> 39:18.980
good heavens, Peterson certainly has made very similar points.

39:19.180 --> 39:20.780
And back to what David's saying,

39:20.980 --> 39:25.500
thus Foucault is highly skeptical of the possibility of a meaningful societal

39:25.700 --> 39:30.500
revolution, because without a comprehensive evaluation of the plethora

39:30.700 --> 39:35.940
of institutions that govern our daily lives, we risk perpetuating the same

39:36.140 --> 39:38.580
oppressive schema.

39:38.780 --> 39:40.980
And here, David makes a really interesting point.

39:41.180 --> 39:44.180
He says, the thinkers that Peterson cites as

39:44.300 --> 39:49.060
representatives of postmodern movement, Michel Foucault and Jacques Dorida,

39:49.260 --> 39:53.820
were greatly indebted to the Western philosophical and literary canons,

39:54.020 --> 39:58.300
with some commentators even labeling them neocontents.

39:58.500 --> 40:03.780
Peterson's reduction of these thinkers to philosophical aberrations

40:03.980 --> 40:11.180
detached from Western civilization, illuminates his obliviousness to said canon.

40:11.380 --> 40:15.380
Great point by David here, a very important one in this article, because

40:15.580 --> 40:21.420
this conversation Peterson had with Camille Parglayer perfectly illustrates

40:21.620 --> 40:24.620
what David's saying here, because you can clearly see

40:24.820 --> 40:29.740
both of them, Parglayer and Peterson, are being very dismissive of these

40:29.940 --> 40:33.420
French intellectuals, saying that they didn't read the classics, that they weren't

40:33.620 --> 40:37.380
well read in the Western canon, they were uneducated.

40:37.580 --> 40:40.460
But good heavens, I mean,

40:40.740 --> 40:44.900
maybe this is just my own ignorance and my lack of,

40:45.100 --> 40:47.380
let's say, proper academic training.

40:47.580 --> 40:54.420
But when I read some of, you know, I've only mostly read Sartre and Foucault.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.140
I don't get the impression at all that

40:57.340 --> 41:01.580
they're uneducated or that they haven't read enough Western philosophy, because

41:01.780 --> 41:05.780
they seem deeply well read scholars.

41:05.780 --> 41:11.460
And I don't think in any way one could say that their aberrations to Western

41:11.660 --> 41:14.780
philosophy, in many ways,

41:15.660 --> 41:18.900
as David points out, they seem to be continuing on.

41:19.100 --> 41:24.140
I'm not saying it's just them, but they seem to be continuing on the Kantian project.

41:24.340 --> 41:29.620
You know, all the way from Kant to Heidegger to whatever is going to come up now.

41:29.820 --> 41:33.860
And I don't think the aberrations in that in that case.

41:33.940 --> 41:38.140
And this conversation Peterson had with Pogliac just demonstrate,

41:38.340 --> 41:43.820
I wouldn't say, like, I think the point David makes, he eliminates his own obliviousness

41:44.020 --> 41:47.980
to said canon, that might be a bit unfair, but it just

41:48.180 --> 41:51.820
demonstrate that deep visceral hatred

41:52.020 --> 41:58.180
Peterson has for these French intellectuals by being sort of casually dismissive of them.

41:58.380 --> 42:00.980
And then we get to another

42:01.100 --> 42:04.100
very important point, and especially a point that I really enjoyed.

42:04.300 --> 42:09.460
Not point a part of the essay that I really enjoyed, especially given my recent

42:09.660 --> 42:12.900
let's call it an amulement with Hannah Arendt's work.

42:13.100 --> 42:19.140
It's the section Peterson, Aaron and totalitarianism.

42:19.340 --> 42:23.300
Peterson doesn't seem to mention Hannah Arendt much in his work.

42:23.500 --> 42:27.100
Yes, he just speak a lot about totalitarianism for sure.

42:27.100 --> 42:28.540
I mean,

42:28.740 --> 42:32.820
maps of meaning was pretty much all about Peterson trying to understand,

42:33.020 --> 42:38.820
you know, not the Nazis and totalitarianism and tyranny and all of that.

42:39.020 --> 42:43.860
But rarely does he mention Hannah Arendt, which is quite surprising, as David points out.

42:44.060 --> 42:49.260
He says, what is particularly striking is that Peterson makes no significant use

42:49.460 --> 42:55.980
of Hannah Arendt, the think of fascism and totalitarianism by excellence.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.820
I agree.

42:58.020 --> 43:03.300
He just mentioned her briefly, however, suggesting that her seminal text, a text,

43:03.500 --> 43:05.900
the banality of evil,

43:06.100 --> 43:10.780
would have better been more appropriately titled The Evil of Banality.

43:10.980 --> 43:15.420
In fact, let me find that quote so that, you know, we don't want to

43:15.620 --> 43:19.540
give the impression that David's quoting Peterson out of context here.

43:19.740 --> 43:20.940
It's 269.

43:20.940 --> 43:25.860
I could quickly find the quote because I was going through this few days ago.

43:26.060 --> 43:29.500
Peterson writes, nonetheless,

43:29.700 --> 43:32.860
we are more than we see

43:33.060 --> 43:37.940
and are more trouble than we imagine when undisciplined and unrealized.

43:38.140 --> 43:41.060
The banality of evil, Hannah Arendt's

43:41.260 --> 43:47.740
famous phrase applied to the often unprecessing Nazi personality,

43:47.860 --> 43:51.380
is more accurately the evil of banality.

43:51.580 --> 43:58.180
Our petty weaknesses accumulate and multiply and become the great evils of state.

43:58.380 --> 44:01.020
As our technological power expands,

44:01.220 --> 44:06.820
the danger we pose increases and the consequences of our voluntary stupidity

44:07.020 --> 44:13.140
multiply is increasingly necessary that we set ourselves, not others, right.

44:13.340 --> 44:16.460
And that we learn explicitly what that means.

44:16.580 --> 44:19.260
Yes. So again, this is Peterson from 1999,

44:19.460 --> 44:26.060
and he still very much talks and writes in similar prose and similar themes.

44:26.260 --> 44:29.340
So again, the part I'm trying to make is David

44:29.540 --> 44:35.020
had hasn't misquoted him in any way or quoted him out of context.

44:35.220 --> 44:40.740
The absence of Aaron's work in Peterson's exploration of these themes is suspicious

44:40.940 --> 44:45.980
and signals that his understanding of totalitarianism is missing integral

44:46.100 --> 44:49.540
philosophical insight, perhaps true.

44:49.740 --> 44:52.780
This is particularly true of the lineage he

44:52.980 --> 44:57.260
traces between nihilism and the development of totalitarianism.

44:57.460 --> 45:01.380
So another bit of an experiment I did was I went on incognito.

45:01.580 --> 45:04.860
I had to and I googled

45:05.060 --> 45:07.660
just plainly Jordan Peterson and Hannah Aaron.

45:07.860 --> 45:12.300
And I wanted to see if there was anything that involved

45:12.420 --> 45:15.860
Peterson talking about Hannah Aaron, and I couldn't find anything not in his

45:16.060 --> 45:19.340
writing, not in his lectures. So if it is right here, in fact,

45:19.340 --> 45:22.740
the only thing I found was this reddit thread of another person asking

45:22.940 --> 45:27.620
on the Jordan Peterson subreddit, is anyone here familiar with Hannah Aaron?

45:27.820 --> 45:30.940
Because both Peterson and Hannah Aaron seem to be

45:31.140 --> 45:36.700
in the deepest possible way trying to understand totalitarianism.

45:36.700 --> 45:40.140
Maybe Peterson, more from a psychological perspective, and Hannah Aaron,

45:40.180 --> 45:42.940
more from a sociological and philosophical perspective.

45:43.140 --> 45:49.260
But I would certainly imagine Peterson bringing up in more of his lectures.

45:49.460 --> 45:51.940
So that is the point to keep in mind.

45:52.140 --> 45:55.900
And just a completely ancillary point here.

45:56.100 --> 46:02.820
I think what really turned me to Hannah Aaron's work again was David for sure.

46:03.020 --> 46:08.340
But in particular, it was this series David did.

46:08.540 --> 46:10.900
Hannah Aaron's The Origins of Totalitarianism.

46:11.100 --> 46:14.780
In fact, I ordered the book and it's on its way.

46:14.980 --> 46:16.780
I thought Amazon Prime was much faster,

46:16.980 --> 46:19.180
but they're taking like weeks to build the book.

46:19.380 --> 46:20.260
Doesn't matter.

46:20.460 --> 46:23.980
But I want to this is going to be the next book that I read.

46:24.180 --> 46:26.100
It's on my list because

46:26.300 --> 46:29.220
this series David did, it was amazing.

46:29.420 --> 46:33.340
I learned so much and I had to I had to read the book.

46:33.540 --> 46:35.260
There was no question about it because

46:35.380 --> 46:41.620
David converted me into an erudite, erudite.

46:41.820 --> 46:44.060
Anyway,

46:44.260 --> 46:48.700
and this leads to an interesting point, interesting

46:48.900 --> 46:50.660
two, two, two views here, isn't it?

46:50.860 --> 46:55.540
There's the Hannah Aaron view of the strong man, Nazi personality.

46:55.740 --> 47:01.260
And then there's a Peterson view of the of our individual moral failings

47:01.460 --> 47:05.140
that that causes nihilism and that causes the state to become corrupt.

47:05.340 --> 47:06.620
So

47:06.820 --> 47:08.820
how do we reconcile these two views?

47:09.020 --> 47:09.580
I don't know.

47:09.580 --> 47:15.420
I don't think David is set in the article, but he does point out some

47:15.620 --> 47:18.540
contradictory points between Hannah Aaron's views,

47:18.740 --> 47:23.700
where she took a much more critical philosophical lens and viewed what happened

47:23.900 --> 47:29.660
in the 20th century and then Pearson's views that he portrays more in detail in

47:29.860 --> 47:32.020
maps of meaning. Here's what David writes.

47:32.340 --> 47:35.860
This idea of of of indifference and

47:36.060 --> 47:41.180
apathy that Peterson says is what causes totalitarianism versus,

47:41.380 --> 47:43.140
let's say,

47:43.340 --> 47:48.780
taking upon responsibility, being the ubermensch or a saviour sometimes

47:48.980 --> 47:53.620
and understanding that we play a role in the

47:53.820 --> 47:57.860
in the birth or the imbuement of totalitarian

47:57.900 --> 48:03.940
totalitarian states or personality or individuals or tyrants.

48:04.140 --> 48:07.300
So David writes, sorry, I was very

48:07.500 --> 48:10.140
inarticulate and trying to make that point.

48:10.340 --> 48:11.780
I'm still learning apologies.

48:11.980 --> 48:17.460
But David writes, as Hannah Aaron argues in the origins of totalitarianism,

48:17.660 --> 48:20.220
that what is hard to pronounce?

48:20.420 --> 48:21.940
It's kind of a mouthful.

48:22.140 --> 48:24.260
Indifference to public affairs and new

48:24.340 --> 48:29.580
gravity on political issues are in themselves no sufficient cause for the

48:29.780 --> 48:31.820
rise of totalitarian movements.

48:32.020 --> 48:37.140
According to Aaron, it is the strong man rather than the indifferent public that

48:37.340 --> 48:42.060
has historically led to the rise of totalitarian regimes.

48:42.260 --> 48:48.900
As she explains, competitive and hostile attitudes are very useful for those forms

48:49.100 --> 48:53.940
of dictatorship in which a strong man takes upon himself the troublesome

48:53.940 --> 49:00.140
responsibility for the conduct of public affairs and hardly conforms to traditional

49:00.340 --> 49:03.300
or typical definitions of nihilism.

49:03.500 --> 49:04.420
This is the point.

49:04.620 --> 49:05.380
This is the point.

49:05.380 --> 49:07.300
This is an important point because clearly,

49:07.500 --> 49:10.700
Peterson talks a lot about taking upon

49:10.900 --> 49:16.020
carrying your own yoke to put it in Christian parlance or taking upon the world's

49:16.220 --> 49:21.780
burdens onto oneself and then sort of being a saviour.

49:21.980 --> 49:26.980
That in in in contrast to, let's say, apathy or indifference.

49:27.180 --> 49:32.860
Now, Aaron says, actually, no, indifference and apathy isn't the reason that

49:33.060 --> 49:37.820
totalitarianism permeates and rises.

49:38.020 --> 49:44.780
It's rather it's this strong man, Nietzschean, ubermunch kind of personality.

49:44.980 --> 49:46.700
I don't know what to make of it.

49:46.860 --> 49:51.740
Firstly, I haven't read this book, even though I listen to David's lecture.

49:51.940 --> 49:53.580
So I want to first read the book.

49:53.780 --> 49:56.420
Maybe then I have a better idea.

49:56.620 --> 50:01.060
But it certainly is something to think about, because I certainly

50:01.260 --> 50:05.020
I most most definitely can see how

50:05.220 --> 50:11.620
that idea of I think Nietzsche calls it injecting meaning into one's veins,

50:11.780 --> 50:15.580
where that idea of being this

50:15.780 --> 50:18.660
hyper disciplined, sort of aesthetic

50:18.860 --> 50:22.980
individual who takes upon responsibility and

50:23.180 --> 50:29.780
and has orders, hyper conscientious, how that can very easily become a peculiar kind

50:29.980 --> 50:35.460
of hubristic, almost narcissistic

50:35.660 --> 50:40.180
way to become a strong man and then an eventual tyrant or totalitarian, at least

50:40.180 --> 50:44.460
psychologically, I can see how that can manifest in someone in like a sort of

50:44.660 --> 50:45.700
like a psychic state.

50:45.900 --> 50:50.220
And I would even say, maybe I've even seen that in some people.

50:50.420 --> 50:52.020
Maybe even myself, who knows?

50:52.220 --> 50:53.620
But

50:53.820 --> 50:56.780
Hannah Aaron's point, it should be taken to heart.

50:56.980 --> 50:58.060
It's a good point.

50:58.260 --> 51:01.940
And David just laid out well here.

51:02.140 --> 51:05.900
And then he gets to an interesting point here on essentialism, this idea that there

51:05.900 --> 51:10.780
are essential, essential, there's an essential nature to being human, which to

51:10.980 --> 51:17.380
some extent, I still believe I'm not a complete, in that sense, anti-essentialist.

51:17.580 --> 51:19.580
But David writes,

51:19.780 --> 51:23.900
Aaron's description of the strong man has founded upon the belief in a kind of

51:24.100 --> 51:29.660
human nature, which would be subject to the same laws of growth as that of the

51:29.660 --> 51:36.220
individual shares a strong affinity with Peterson's persistent reliance on

51:36.420 --> 51:40.540
essentialist positions as illustrated in statements about

51:40.740 --> 51:44.180
essential female and masculine pathologies.

51:44.380 --> 51:47.180
Aaron elaborates on these essentialist

51:47.380 --> 51:52.220
beliefs as irrelevant since Western philosophy and religion has been defining

51:52.420 --> 51:55.620
and redefining it for more than 3,000 years.

51:55.780 --> 52:01.060
Now, while it's true, this idea of redefining and defining, I would say,

52:01.260 --> 52:04.140
and again, this is completely an intuition.

52:04.340 --> 52:07.940
I have no firstly

52:08.140 --> 52:12.660
verbal majority, but also real,

52:12.860 --> 52:17.380
let's say, sociological and anthropological

52:17.580 --> 52:19.380
evidence to back up this claim.

52:19.580 --> 52:24.380
But I do feel intuitively when I look at many cultures and when I even just read

52:24.420 --> 52:29.900
about cultures and even experience some cultures, there always seems to be

52:30.100 --> 52:34.700
this kind of masculine and feminine, not and again, it's not a male-female thing,

52:34.900 --> 52:40.020
because a man could be feminine and masculine both and the other way around.

52:40.220 --> 52:42.860
So it's not really

52:45.260 --> 52:49.420
a biological distinction, even though the biological distinction exists.

52:49.420 --> 52:53.500
What I'm trying to say is this idea of the

52:53.700 --> 52:57.220
of kind of an essential feminine and masculine spirit, let's say.

52:57.420 --> 53:02.660
It does seem I don't know if it's fair to say that that doesn't exist at all,

53:02.860 --> 53:06.940
because one could see it in so many different cultures all across the world.

53:07.140 --> 53:12.860
And if something is that common, isn't that maybe pointing towards some kind

53:13.060 --> 53:15.500
of deep truth? Who knows?

53:15.700 --> 53:17.420
But again,

53:17.620 --> 53:21.460
the point, David's the more deeper point David's trying to make here is that

53:21.660 --> 53:25.860
that that attitude of essentialism could lead to

53:26.060 --> 53:30.340
this totalitarian kind of mindset where you say, this is the way things should be

53:30.540 --> 53:34.300
done, this absolutist,

53:34.500 --> 53:39.220
almost despotic attitude that this is the way this should be done.

53:39.420 --> 53:41.180
So that certainly begs the question.

53:41.180 --> 53:44.740
And David doesn't really point this out in the article, but this is exactly what

53:44.780 --> 53:47.020
I was thinking while I was reading it is,

53:47.220 --> 53:49.900
is how do we properly take Peterson's,

53:50.100 --> 53:54.500
this adopt responsibility or personal responsibility mantra too hard,

53:54.700 --> 53:56.660
which I think is a good message.

53:56.860 --> 54:03.140
But how do we prevent it from being pathologized as a drive to be a totalitarian?

54:03.340 --> 54:04.980
Because

54:05.180 --> 54:07.660
and this is something I realized recently,

54:07.860 --> 54:12.580
enlargement thinking, we like to think that it was all about freedom and liberty

54:12.780 --> 54:13.820
and equality.

54:14.020 --> 54:17.820
But no, it certainly had an absolutist attitude towards it.

54:18.020 --> 54:20.020
You know, Hobbes, for example.

54:20.220 --> 54:23.660
So there were many enlightenment thinkers who were absolutist.

54:23.860 --> 54:28.700
And more importantly, the deeper point is the idea of there being, let's say,

54:28.700 --> 54:32.300
categories and that is essential, this attitude of enlightenment thinking

54:32.500 --> 54:37.460
that can be certainly connected or even imbue

54:37.580 --> 54:41.140
tyrannical, totalitarian sort of thinking.

54:41.340 --> 54:42.820
So

54:43.020 --> 54:45.020
it's how do we delineate that?

54:45.220 --> 54:48.020
And it's very it's very nuanced there.

54:48.220 --> 54:52.020
And I really didn't think of this until

54:52.220 --> 54:54.380
maybe one or two years ago.

54:54.580 --> 54:56.380
So

54:56.580 --> 54:59.780
something to ponder and reflect on.

54:59.980 --> 55:01.740
And now we get to the most,

55:01.940 --> 55:06.340
in my opinion, the part I like the most and the most interesting part of the article,

55:06.380 --> 55:10.180
especially because I'm a Nietzschean and and the more I read Nietzsche,

55:10.380 --> 55:14.300
the more I thought, oh, Peterson's, there's something if people don't

55:14.500 --> 55:18.980
read Nietzsche and listen to Peterson lecture on Nietzsche,

55:19.180 --> 55:22.260
they'd get a completely different picture on who Nietzsche is.

55:22.460 --> 55:25.180
But in any case, I am a Nietzschean and I really like this part.

55:25.380 --> 55:27.380
And I thought David made some good points.

55:27.580 --> 55:32.380
So the question is, is Peterson misappropriating Nietzsche?

55:32.580 --> 55:34.460
What I mean by this is I'm not saying

55:34.460 --> 55:38.980
Peterson is misquoting or quoting man of context or trying to,

55:39.180 --> 55:45.580
yeah, intentionally misappropriate him with some kind of

55:45.780 --> 55:50.780
underlying motive, unethical underlying motive, not at all.

55:50.980 --> 55:53.900
But sometimes because like all of us,

55:54.100 --> 55:56.420
Peterson's got his own ideology.

55:56.620 --> 56:00.660
I'm wondering if what he's really doing is just taking something Nietzsche said

56:00.860 --> 56:04.020
and just fitting it into his philosophy, his ideology.

56:04.020 --> 56:07.700
And then, you know, sharing it with the public.

56:07.900 --> 56:09.700
Whereas

56:09.900 --> 56:11.980
this isn't what Nietzsche would say.

56:12.180 --> 56:17.260
So as in this synthesis, let's say, of taking what Nietzsche said and

56:17.460 --> 56:21.940
synthesizing it along with what Peterson's saying and whatever that result is,

56:22.140 --> 56:24.980
Nietzsche would completely disagree with what the result is.

56:25.180 --> 56:30.140
He would be totally opposed to Nietzsche's overall philosophy,

56:30.340 --> 56:33.660
even though Nietzsche hasn't really got one set philosophy.

56:33.900 --> 56:36.180
And I think he did that intentionally.

56:36.380 --> 56:39.180
So there is one has to be careful.

56:39.380 --> 56:42.380
One has to be careful when when they

56:42.580 --> 56:47.620
try to understand Nietzsche through a Petersonian lens, let's say.

56:47.820 --> 56:49.980
David writes,

56:50.180 --> 56:55.100
in the birth of tragedy, Nietzsche argues that the notion of truth that runs

56:55.300 --> 56:59.500
through the course of history, history, the course of history,

56:59.700 --> 57:04.140
are founded not on their object, objectivity, but in their

57:04.340 --> 57:07.900
continual self proclamation of objectivity.

57:08.100 --> 57:12.580
For Nietzsche, the shift from language to science plays a scientific method at

57:12.780 --> 57:15.380
the forefront of Western civilization,

57:15.580 --> 57:19.540
making everything quantifiable under the scientific gaze.

57:19.740 --> 57:25.940
As he explains, it is language which works on building the edifice of concepts.

57:26.140 --> 57:28.300
Later, it is science.

57:28.420 --> 57:32.580
Nietzsche expands on this idea of writing.

57:32.780 --> 57:37.260
What I understand about the spirit of science is the belief which first came to

57:37.460 --> 57:42.620
light in the person of Socrates, that the depths of nature can be fathomed

57:42.820 --> 57:46.340
and that knowledge can heal all ills.

57:46.540 --> 57:52.860
According to Nietzsche, this belief in the ultimate infallibility of science or

57:53.060 --> 57:56.100
Socrates's tendency to murder are

57:56.340 --> 58:00.300
is destructive, especially when left unacknowledged.

58:00.500 --> 58:03.820
Now, Peterson here would certainly agree with this point, because

58:04.020 --> 58:07.500
I've listened to a couple of interviews where Peterson comments on Stephen

58:07.700 --> 58:12.740
Pinker's Enlightenment Now, and he pretty much says that he's quite

58:12.940 --> 58:15.900
disappointed that in Enlightenment Now,

58:16.100 --> 58:21.060
Stephen Pinker has all these chapters dedicated to the scientific method,

58:21.060 --> 58:23.380
Enlightenment, freedom, democracy, all that.

58:23.580 --> 58:26.900
And a little chapter towards the latter part of the book.

58:26.900 --> 58:31.460
I haven't read the book, so I'm not really sure, even though I think I've got a copy.

58:32.340 --> 58:34.700
Where he dedicates to the arts and the humanities.

58:34.700 --> 58:37.820
And he says that that's unfortunate, because really it should be the other way

58:38.020 --> 58:44.260
around, because most of life or most of what we are is, let's say,

58:44.460 --> 58:47.300
we should be indebted to the arts and the humanities.

58:47.500 --> 58:50.940
And science is very, very much a new phenomenon.

58:51.020 --> 58:54.060
It's a new thing in our society.

58:54.260 --> 58:56.780
Therefore, it is a good point.

58:56.980 --> 59:02.060
To Nietzsche, science is truly capable of confining the individual within the

59:02.260 --> 59:04.780
smallest circle of solvable tasks.

59:04.980 --> 59:10.100
As he explains, science, spurred on by its powerful delusion,

59:10.300 --> 59:16.020
is hurrying unstoppable to its limits, where the optimism hidden in the essence

59:16.220 --> 59:20.300
of logic will founder and break up.

59:20.980 --> 59:23.740
So then we get to Nietzsche versus 12 Rules for Life.

59:23.740 --> 59:27.500
And this is kind of the point I made when I started commenting on the section

59:27.700 --> 59:33.260
where if Nietzsche read 12 Rules for Life, he probably disagreed with most of it.

59:33.460 --> 59:35.900
And David explains why.

59:36.100 --> 59:40.420
12 Rules for Life proclaiming the necessity for people, young men.

59:40.620 --> 59:45.780
I want to say, you know, David's put this in here kind of as like a slight comment,

59:45.980 --> 59:49.580
you know, kind of being dismissive that all Peterson only caters to this certain

59:49.580 --> 59:55.020
demographic, it seems like a straw man and a ad hominem attack.

59:55.220 --> 01:00:01.260
Because firstly, ad hominem as if helping young men makes him a particular evil person.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.860
I mean, I don't see what's wrong with helping young men.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:06.260
You know, if people need help, people should get help.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.380
I'm a young man.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:11.860
And when I was 20, 21, reading Jordan Peterson's book helped me a lot.

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.980
It gave me structure and meaning and purpose.

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.140
And those things matter.

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.460
Life is difficult.

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:19.460
And I'm truly grateful for that.

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:23.500
And other than that, Peterson,

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:28.780
I know a lot of, in fact, a lot of the people that I know who are Jordan Peterson fans,

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:32.340
let's say, are women.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:37.580
Funny enough, one of my good friends, she and I, we'll be going to the

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:41.820
Jordan Peterson comes to Melbourne, he's visiting Melbourne at the end of the yard

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.620
and we bought tickets for his kind of talk.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.100
And I'll be going with him.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.980
She really, she loves Jordan Peterson.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:53.020
So I don't know if it's fair that, you know, it's it's sort of like a straw man

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:58.180
and a hominem and also, frankly, such slight comments seem unproductive.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.260
I mean, such a good article.

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.620
And it's just saying young men as if it's a bad thing.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:07.420
It cheapens and reduces this well written article to that of a

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.780
headpiece by some corporate media journalists.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:11.980
And that's unfortunate.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:15.100
But anyway, it's just a little bit of criticism that I had,

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:19.020
a little bit of criticism that I have.

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.020
So I'll get back to it.

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:24.340
Twirlers for life proclaiming the necessity for people to adopt an aesthetic

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:29.500
lifestyle in the form of a mutated Christian conservatism, conservatism,

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:35.980
stands diametrically opposed to Nietzsche's central claim in the genealogy of morality,

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:43.540
that the aesthetic ideal is not something to strive for, but rather it is the consequence

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:49.580
of a life attempting to inject artificial meaning into its veins in a poor attempt

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:54.700
at inoculation from degeneration.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:02.060
In this capacity, Peterson resembles the ascetic priest that Nietzsche castigates.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:08.060
The task of intellectual should should not be to inject arbitrary rules and

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.900
regulations into people, but rather to foster

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:18.140
a spectacular scene that welcomes more eyes, various eyes,

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:24.260
we are able to use to sketch a more complete understanding of our objectivity.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.420
Superlative point.

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:31.620
In my opinion, this little para here or this little part sentence, let's say,

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.980
it's the best sentence in the whole article.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:38.260
Really good point, because it's something I began to realize,

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:46.180
maybe again, two or three years ago, because I saw that in our new age

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:51.700
entrenched culture, it seems like every public intellectual is becoming a self

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:54.540
help guru, and that's kind of unfortunate because there's nothing wrong with self

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.100
help, but we should understand that everything has its place.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:01.020
Self help should be separated from

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:05.300
intellectualism and public or public intellectuals, because it seems like

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:09.860
you know, a lot of even the Sam Harris, you know, he's got meditation and mindfulness.

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:13.340
A lot of public intellectuals have just become self help gurus,

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:17.380
kind of the celebrity self self help gurus, and that's unfortunate because the

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:21.940
what intellectual, in my opinion, should do is not reaffirm what you already believe.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:27.540
But yes, as David beautifully puts it, it clearly points out.

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:32.140
Really make us feel uncomfortable in our beliefs, make us make us completely

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:35.740
change our perspectives and view the world in different lenses and give us

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:43.980
kind of perspectival seeing Adorno had a great quote, I think, in a aesthetic theory.

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:49.740
I'm completely paraphrasing here, but he says and he's talking about art here.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:55.180
He says, Adorno, that the real purpose of art should be to.

01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.140
Sort of.

01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:00.700
I can't really remember the quote, but the idea is the purpose of art should be

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:07.420
to make us feel uncomfortable, to challenge our dogmas, our pre-health beliefs and really.

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:13.060
You know, lift, change our life radically and fundamentally in how we view the world.

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.620
And in my opinion, that's also what a public

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.580
intellectual should do, not become a self help guru.

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.220
And if they want to become self help guru, there's nothing wrong with that.

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.540
That's that's OK.

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.660
But then there's something else.

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:27.860
They're not a public intellectual or an intellectual for that matter.

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:33.260
So this is probably the best point David makes in the whole article.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.580
Peterson's project is that is an attempt then to move away from the Nietzsche

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:43.460
notion of perspectival scene toward the domain of a historical, a contextual scene.

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:48.500
This narrowing of possibility operates to maintain the authority of those who choose

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:53.660
what is considered worth seeing and through that through and through what needs

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.580
pushing society towards sovereign and

01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:00.260
the tutorial rule. Again, this last bit here

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:05.860
is quite apt to the whole covid lockdown controversy debate that a lot of people

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:09.060
got got into in the intellectual dark web.

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.980
I'm using that as an umbrella term

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:15.940
for like the Peterson's and the Sam Harris's.

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.860
That's again, that idea of perspectival

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:18.820
thing is quite important here.

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.420
So then we get to the section where it's the science versus Peterson.

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:26.580
And then David comments on

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:34.660
some of the Aristotelian notions of science.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.940
He writes,

01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:41.860
though Peterson's line of argumentation seems to suggest a science postmodernism

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:47.260
opposition, a considerable number of scientific journals have published articles

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:53.700
addressing the growing stigmatization and discrimination, trans and gender

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:56.900
queer people experience regularly.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:57.900
It's a good point.

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.780
A lot of us don't spend the time to go and read up on these articles,

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:06.500
but there certainly is a a good amount of literature that probably uses the

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.020
scientific method to point this out.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:09.860
So it is true.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:13.060
There is that stigmatization

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.860
within trans people, especially maybe because it's now it's become a lot more

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.500
political. And that's quite unfortunate.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:22.020
That is that is deep.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.740
I hate saying that's quite that's quite

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.260
unfortunate because it's like a throwaway term for everything these days.

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:29.180
But that's that's a that's a sad truth.

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:32.380
And we should think about that.

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.980
We should think about that.

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:38.180
Such articles, though they conform to the same

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:45.420
scientific rationale utilized by Peterson, shed light on the great deal of contradictions,

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:51.940
oppositions and diversion, believes in this supposedly objective field of study.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.580
This is an important point David makes.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:58.460
These studies correspond to the domain of research that aligns with the

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:03.020
Aristotelian Aristotelian, God, I can't pronounce that,

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:08.420
aligns with the Aristotelian maxim of phronesis, which may be understood as

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:14.860
fostering practical intellectual activity aimed at clarifying the problems

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:21.220
risks and possibilities we face as humans and society, societies.

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:25.420
This approach, although still immersed in the scientific tradition,

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:32.420
stands opposed to the other domain of Aristotelian reason of episteme

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:36.700
that proclaims the a priori nature of scientific knowledge.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.700
So this again kind of touches on that.

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:42.660
How do we derive Oates plainly from science?

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:48.980
Because it seems like the scientific institution itself is,

01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:53.580
let's say, bifurcated into this phronesis and episteme.

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:59.980
And in many ways, phronesis does help us derive Oates,

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.820
but it is complicated because that also involves

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:09.620
contextual seeing, sociology, sociology, all of that.

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:13.340
This brand of research, while disavowed by Peterson,

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:18.060
presents a foray into the lives and experiences of marginalized groups

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:22.260
that would otherwise be silenced, absolutely.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:26.700
And now another interesting point I would say from the whole article,

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:32.700
my favorite parts were Nietzsche and postmodernism and the

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:35.820
Baudrillard reality and truth.

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:42.460
Well worth a read, just just do those two parts.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:47.660
The question asks the question that Baudrillard asks us, what is objective truth?

01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:52.660
Job Baudrillard has vigorously challenged the position held by scholars such as

01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:58.180
Peterson on objectivity and truth, suggesting instead that science like any

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:04.700
discourse is organized on the basis of a conventional logic,

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:09.620
adding that it explains things which have been defined

01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:16.860
and formalized in advance, which subsequently conform to these explanations.

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:20.940
And again, Peterson would agree with this point because I've listened to his

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.540
conversations with recently Richard Dawkins and then Sam Harris,

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:27.780
where they get into the fact value distinction.

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:34.860
And again, one would assume that Peterson would find a certain

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:40.220
certain validity in what Baudrillard's pointing out here, because

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:43.660
in that sense, Richard Feynman, I'm I'm

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:48.660
connecting many figures here, Richard Feynman, probably my favorite scientist.

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:50.020
I love listening to his lectures.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:54.820
He is actually wrong to say the philosophy of science is as useful to

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:59.060
scientists as ornithology is to birds.

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:01.780
That's that's a that's a wrong statement.

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.660
That's an invalid statement, in my opinion, because no, no, no,

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:07.500
the philosophy of science is a part of the scientific process.

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.500
It's a part of the scientific institution.

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:15.980
In many ways, it maybe is what this Aristotelian frenesis is about.

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:22.580
We need to understand what science is and how we make our presuppositions.

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:25.020
Oh, sorry, on what

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:28.860
on what presuppositions we start from, on what axioms.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.700
And that's a good heavens.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:35.900
That's probably that probably is the fundamental question of science these days.

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.340
How do we make our assumptions?

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.700
Where what's the starting point?

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:44.660
And again, I think apart from the conversations that I've

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:49.700
heard Peterson have, he probably understands that this problem inherently

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.100
exists in our modern conception of science.

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:57.460
It's probably why he's interested in Jung in archetypes and

01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:03.100
Christian Neoplatonism, symbolism and in general, religious narrative,

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:09.140
because he sees those to be a sort of he sees that can be coupled with science

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:14.460
to find some kind of, let's say, objective starting point for science to work off.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:18.980
And I don't know if that's possible, but it certainly at least points to the

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.180
problem or hints at the problem.

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:26.380
So David states, Baudrillard doesn't say that scientific conclusions are invalid.

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.500
He actually doesn't, I think.

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:33.900
I haven't read much Baudrillard, obviously, but I don't get that impression, at least.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:39.300
But what he says very clearly is that whatever these scientific conclusions are,

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:46.620
these conclusions should not be transposed onto any societal or cultural context.

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:53.060
So these studies, some studies that he cited above in the article,

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:58.620
the studies speak to the late Baudrillard's conception of singularity.

01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:04.740
OK, I'm going to say this is a part that I kind of am struggling to grok yet.

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:07.260
I still can't fathom it.

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:11.140
I don't know, for me, it still seems incomprehensible, but I think it's because I

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:14.700
haven't done enough reading, I haven't done enough studying to Baudrillard.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:17.580
So David writes,

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:24.100
Baudrillard's conception of singularity, which holds that every detail of the world

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:28.260
is perfect if it is not referred to some larger set.

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:34.700
Reality for Baudrillard is always caught in a play of signification and suggestions

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:39.380
of a naturality made by the authoritative

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:44.420
scientific community, mistake the only true nature of the world as a world of

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:51.860
appearances in which there may not be anything but a discourse of the real and the rational.

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:57.340
Just a point here, the idea of I think this in many ways is the

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:01.220
scientific question. Oh, sorry, the philosophical question and the philosophical

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:09.620
battle that we've been having since time immorial, ever since Socrates, Plato, all that is.

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:15.300
In our epistemology, how do we know what's true and how do we know what's

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.700
appearing as true?

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:21.300
It seems to be the distinction between, let's say, the

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:26.900
the rationalist and the empiricists between the

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:33.700
Joan Locke and the David Hume or the continental philosophers and then the

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:35.780
English analytical philosophers.

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:40.020
How do we know what's true and what appears as true?

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:44.900
So that's such an important point and Baudrillard is,

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:50.100
in many ways, Baudrillard's working off that here.

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.740
According to Baudrillard,

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:59.580
then notions of an objective truth are fundamentally flawed and any attempt to occupy

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:04.700
an objective field of study is bound to fail and merely become

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:10.620
signs, signifiers of a real signified.

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:14.220
I hope there's a bit of a wordplay there, that's difficult to understand.

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:18.900
The fundamental impossibility of performing objective studies and or

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:24.580
revealing fundamental truths is understood by Baudrillard and his theory of simulation.

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:30.780
For Baudrillard, simulation occurs when the world has become real beyond our

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:34.180
wildest expectations

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:38.620
and can be described as the outcome of calculated

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:42.740
move to put the illusion of the world to death.

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:50.940
Scientific discourse that rely on notions on notions of objectivity and truth,

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:57.580
therefore dissolve into the imaginary of the sign or the sphere of truth

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:03.700
and leaves us with reality and therefore simulation in all its glory.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:09.620
The real then is merely a particular case of that simulation that Baudrillard

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:14.820
argues, loves our society to think itself

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:19.340
and live itself as superior to all others.

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:25.220
Baudrillard's work can be read as not necessarily opposing the domain of scientific

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:30.140
inquiry, but accounting for the degree to which science,

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:34.980
but accounting for the degree to which any scientific inquiry should be attuned to

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:40.140
the cultural and significator conditions of the object of study.

01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:46.140
So now here's where, again, I completely

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:50.580
attribute this to my lack of understanding, my lack of knowledge.

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:54.900
The reason I'm saying that is not for some kind of false modesty or false humility.

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:58.940
It's because genuinely, I haven't done enough study and reading.

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.700
This is in my field of study.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:05.860
I haven't gone through the proper formal academic process of studying all its

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:09.300
philosophers, I'm a autodidact.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.300
I'm doing it on my own.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.420
But really, sometimes when I read these kind

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:21.260
of paragraphs, I do wonder, is this some kind of word game that these thinkers

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:26.900
are playing with their brilliant verbal and intellectual capabilities

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.300
with their ability to write?

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:33.100
And is it some kind of game?

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.980
I don't even mean game in a cynical way.

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:39.700
I mean, is it truly a way to try to

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:45.620
make some pre-held belief they have and try to make it look as if something

01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:51.100
that's true about the world and make it cohere using language?

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:57.780
Is it is it a language game to sound with with with with with I don't know,

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:02.540
because, OK, when I read this, even though, as I said before, I don't fully

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:07.580
comprehend it or fully understand it, I certainly can see that it's it's

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:15.260
intimations of something true, something that's topically true about reality.

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:23.020
And it points to so many different domains of our current way of doing the world.

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.060
And for me, that coheres, even though what they're trying to say really doesn't

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.980
cohere, if that makes sense.

01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:31.460
Like what I'm trying to say is sort of

01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:35.340
it's a normatively some of what they're saying is like, oh, yeah, that I can see

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:39.300
how how they come to these conclusions.

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:43.900
OK, I don't know, just thinking out loud here, as I tend to do in this podcast.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:49.460
And on the topic of not understanding things, I would say, again, not David's

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:54.980
fault, my own fault, my own ignorance, I truly thought it hard to understand this

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:59.580
section, Baudrillard Butler and those voices of the marginalized.

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:02.980
So that's about the whole essay.

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.660
That's about three or four paragraphs.

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:10.820
And here's the thing, I think part of it was because simply it's that section

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:15.860
of the essay about the gender controversy that I didn't really care that much to be

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:20.980
frank. And I think I just truly couldn't I couldn't penetrate it.

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:21.940
That's what it was.

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:26.020
It was the reason I found it a bit incomprehensible was because

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:29.980
I could see that David's making some important points here, but I couldn't.

01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:31.340
I don't know. I didn't know why.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:35.340
But for example, the previous points, even though there were parts of it that I

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:39.660
didn't really get, I at least I at least got the essence of his argument.

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:43.940
I was getting at where he was going to it.

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:47.060
But this section for me, I just couldn't I couldn't penetrate it.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:51.900
And it it didn't click with me to put it plainly.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.540
And apart from that,

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.900
this is just a complete personal thing.

01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:02.860
I've recently been trying to study Heidegger, been trying to get through being in time.

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:06.620
Mate, I am eternally perplexed about everything.

01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:10.780
I haven't really, if you can probably see from this podcast, I haven't got anything

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:15.620
substantial or coherent to say, but especially phenomenology, but virtually

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:20.100
anything because Heidegger has completely

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.780
overturned my views on so many things.

01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.780
So

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:28.060
yeah, I'm in this place of this deep.

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:32.340
I'm I'm self I'm being extremely self critical of what I believe.

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:37.380
And I'm also very uncertain about virtually all my beliefs.

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:42.620
And that on that rather legubrious note, let's go to the conclusion.

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:45.380
But before I do read the conclusion, I want to say something.

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:50.180
Firstly, I want to say I think Peterson

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:55.540
totally deeply understands everything that David points out here, even though

01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:57.780
he isn't very explicit about it.

01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:02.580
He does get his he sees this inherent

01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:08.300
income and stability between between what we have as modern science and how can we

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.820
derive values from it?

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:14.380
He sees the incomes, income and stability between what

01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:19.260
modernity tells us and the deeper truth that postmodernist found this idea of

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:24.100
context, he's even said it in a couple of his podcasts that he does agree

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:30.140
with this notion of the complexity of interpretations and how much,

01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:34.540
how deep that that really goes into reality in some sense, not just at,

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:38.820
let's say, at the level of text or hermeneutics, but that this this this

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:41.340
the problem of interpretation is a big problem.

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:45.940
And he points to AI researchers, he points to many, many places within the field

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.100
of science to to hit at that.

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.700
So I think he gets it.

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:54.580
And I would say it's because of that, maybe that I say that I,

01:20:54.780 --> 01:21:00.100
apart from him as a person, but just at an intellectual, I began to admire him

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:05.020
a lot more because he's willing to publicly flesh out these ideas and make

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:09.580
mistakes publicly, especially someone like him who's got such public acclaim.

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:14.060
And, and, you know, because he gets himself in all his political controversies,

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:18.420
the moment he makes a mistake, he is hammered and he is,

01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:22.580
is there always caving critiques written about him, which can be quite difficult

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:23.940
being a public figure.

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:28.300
One shouldn't just think that that's it's quite hard to go through that.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.660
It's it's a lot of stress.

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:36.460
So I do admire that kind of courage that he has to publicly deal with these issues.

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:38.380
And

01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:42.980
I I've got to say I am a bit disheartened that I

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:48.380
feel like with time, with his influence, he's becoming more and more ideological

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:54.860
and even a bit more dogmatic in his in his beliefs and his views, which for me

01:21:55.060 --> 01:22:00.140
is unfortunate because then this project, he has to work this out to try and reconcile

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:04.540
these, if it's reconcilable, these

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:07.060
incumbents or abilities,

01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:11.620
I feel like that then he won't have a genuine journey in doing that because if

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.780
he becomes more and more, let's say, dogmatic in his views,

01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:17.780
I really hope that he doesn't go there.

01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:22.700
But again, all the points David makes in this article, I think is very apt to who

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:27.220
Jordan Peterson is and I think he gets it.

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.980
Secondly, I want to say, David,

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:33.540
if you have, if you do watch this episode, I really hope you do.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:37.460
I want to try and treat this at you a couple of times to to try and get your

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:40.940
attention. But if you do watch this episode and if you come this far,

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:43.860
mate, I know I'm very, very long winded.

01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:45.260
It's a problem of mine.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:46.620
I never get to the point.

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:48.820
But if you come this far, I would like to

01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:53.420
sincerely invite you on the podcast for an interview because I would love to talk

01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:56.580
to you and learn from you. I have so many questions.

01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:58.940
I got to say, David, again,

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:04.180
not blowing steam up your ass, put it in a vulgar way.

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:08.540
You truly have been that kind of intellectual that you talk about this

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:11.020
part here about perspectival scene.

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:15.340
You probably are seeing right now me learning from you and trying to

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:20.620
try to see the world and see all these topics through different perspectives

01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:25.100
and different views, because you foster that kind of perspective of seeing in me.

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:29.340
So and I'm a product of in that sense of your YouTube channel,

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:33.660
a living example, let's say, to put it in a dramatic way.

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:39.940
And again, your work on Hannah Irwin has made me fall in love with her in some sense.

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.500
Maybe, you know, in fact, maybe I should have you on the podcast if you do agree

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:50.580
that is, of course, after I'm done reading the origins of totalitarianism.

01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:53.820
Because then I'll have something a bit more substantial to discuss with you.

01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:56.620
But again, this is my invite to the podcast.

01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:04.540
And on that note, I would read the conclusion to the article and end this episode.

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:10.540
Beyond locating the various contradictions and fallacious remarks Peterson makes,

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:18.340
this paper has also argued that Peterson's assault against Bill C-16 risks mirroring

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:26.140
the same systemic instantiations of totalitarianism that he claims to know so much about.

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:28.300
To reiterate,

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:33.060
this is not to suggest that he represents these movements directly,

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:38.540
but that there are many affinities between these oppressive ideological systems

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:42.180
and Peterson's faith in a universal conception of truth.

01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:44.580
That's to a point.

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:50.100
This paper serves the purpose of mounting a philosophically analytical rebuttal

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:56.260
to Peterson's central claims by pointing an eminent critique.

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.940
Pointing to the many shortcomings of his

01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:05.980
speculations and locating epistemic fallacies that may be observed in his ideas.

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:11.020
This is a necessary form of critique because unlike the Hegelian model of

01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:18.300
oppositional politics that poses a critique from an antithetical and exterior

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:24.820
positionality, this form identifies the core of the theoretical inadequacy

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.300
of Peterson's project from the inside.

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.700
And I think, David, you accomplished that.
