0	5400	And I'm sorry if this is a very kind of like a vague question, but are you familiar with
5400	6400	the philosopher?
6400	11360	Well, he's he's he calls himself doing foundations of physics.
11360	12360	Tim Modellin.
12360	14680	Um, no, I haven't heard of him.
14680	15680	Yeah.
15680	16680	So basically he's a fellow.
16680	20920	He works in a philosophy department, although what his primary works like he's got a background
20920	21920	in physics.
21920	28720	I think he's got a PhD in physics and he his work is on deriving ontologies of the physical
28720	31680	universe based on physics and what we know about modern physics.
31680	34040	So he calls it the foundations of physics.
34040	40200	And then when I was reading your stuff, it got me thinking, um, uh, is there such a thing
40200	48000	as the, let's say the philosophical foundations of cognitive science and AGI, let's say, is
48000	55720	is that something that we'd say researchers are actively working on or is that just what
55720	59040	we would collectively call a philosophy of mine.
59040	64600	So I think that with, uh, cognitive science, a lot of it is founded in things like logic
64600	67440	and probability theory.
67440	73400	And, uh, like, like there's, for example, the Bayesian brain hypothesis, which is hypothesis
73400	77000	at the bind approximates Bayesian inference.
77000	80400	And there's there are at least some empirical tests that provide some limited support for
80400	81400	this.
82200	86920	And there's more generally things like the problem of induction where there's this open
86920	92520	question of how does the mind, uh, deduce, like induce the future from the past.
92520	98320	But like, even if there's no logical justification for why the sun will rise tomorrow if it's
98320	104240	always risen in the past, human minds will do this and there's some mechanistic explanation
104240	105240	for this.
106080	116880	Um, so I think the, uh, some of the foundations include these like basic things that are considered
116880	123120	like parts of good reasoning, such as, um, uh, logic and probability theory.
123120	128840	Uh, then there's, uh, you mentioned the mind body problem, um, and that's that definitely
128840	133320	intersects with neuroscience a lot because there's this methodological assumption that
133320	136800	these states of the mind are somehow encoded in the brain.
136800	144440	Um, and this is like broadly pretty likely based on current scientific understanding,
144440	149120	um, that like, for example, there aren't, if you, if you notice some difference in your
149120	155760	mind, you have like n bits in your mental state, then that there have to be at least
155760	162200	n bits in your brain state for that to be, um, represented somehow.
163200	168760	Um, so I, I'd say that neuroscience certainly has a philosophy of mind as a foundation in
168760	176040	terms of assumptions about how the mind's processing, uh, relates to the brain functions.
176040	179280	Honestly, um, sorry, keep going.
179280	183600	Oh, you also mentioned, uh, the foundations of cognitive science and AI.
183600	184600	Yeah.
184600	185600	Yes.
185600	186600	Yes.
186600	189760	I would say that AI is more founded in something I said before, which is just foundations of
189760	195240	correct reasoning, which includes things like logic, probability theory, and induction.
195240	196240	Understood.
196240	197240	Yeah.
197240	202000	Because the one thing I was thinking about was, so for instance, uh, if I kind of expand
202000	208600	on that question, uh, like Tim Maudlin, when, when he says foundations of physics, I feel
208600	211280	like that's in a way quite straightforward.
211280	217320	It's trying to, trying to find, uh, kind of the ontological reality of our physical world,
217320	218840	the physical universe.
218840	225480	But then when it comes to something like AI or maybe perhaps more specifically, uh, COGSI,
225480	231040	it gets a bit hazy because yes, we have cognition and the human subject, but then the question's
231040	233120	like, what is human subjectivity?
233120	237520	And that's a question, I guess, asked since the beginning of philosophy in some sense,
237520	238520	right?
238520	242480	And then especially since the Kant and the German idealist and then that got me thinking,
242480	247280	um, are there really, do we really have, uh, people walking?
247480	255280	In cognitive science that are trying to kind of, uh, let's say speculate and, and derive
255280	263080	meaningful, uh, foundations of what a human subject is based on cognitive science and
263080	264080	AI.
264080	267840	So you would, would you say from what you just said that the answer is yes, or is it
267840	273880	still more like, I'll just focus on the science itself, forget about, uh, you know, ontology
273880	274880	or philosophy?
275880	278320	Oh, I would say yes.
278320	283440	And I think that it might be hard to notice this if you're just looking at papers published
283440	289400	because partially the papers are assuming some amount of background of people in the field
289400	291400	already share certain assumptions.
291400	296640	And partially also, um, when people are presenting their findings, they're not trying to look
296640	297640	too speculative.
297640	304320	Um, like I think a big thing in science is that you, an under-specified part of the scientific
304320	307280	method is how do you even come up with these hypotheses in the first place?
307280	311000	Like the method says, once you have a hypothesis, you should go out and test it, but how do
311000	312000	you come up with the hypothesis?
312000	313440	It can, it can be very intuitive.
313440	315400	It can come to you in a dream, even.
315400	319840	Um, so I think when scientists are presenting their findings, um, they might have gotten
319840	324720	their hypothesis in a certain manner, which might be intuitive or based on kind of philosophical
324720	329720	thought, um, that they're trying to show their finding in a non-speculative manner.
330160	336800	Um, but I think in, certainly I've talked with cognitive scientists and they do tend
336800	339000	to speculate about the human subject.
339000	344720	Um, so I mentioned the Bayesian brain hypothesis and I've learned that hypothesis when it,
344720	348880	perhaps the primary thing that humans are doing is constructing a model of the world
348880	353480	based on sense data that is meant to do things such as predict future sense data.
353480	358640	Um, and then you can even go from that to think about values and like what are values
358680	365680	and, um, there's, there's things like planning algorithms, which might tell you like if, if
365680	370840	I have a certain value that will tend to, um, cause me to take certain actions that
370840	372640	will achieve that end.
372640	375000	And there's various algorithms that approximate that.
375680	384760	Um, and it's, it's very much like, uh, that, like if, if you, if you, if you're having
384760	390240	these sorts of thoughts about what it is like to model the world and to want things and
390240	394840	plan towards them, um, that can certainly influence your own understanding of yourself
394840	396160	or other humans as well.
398440	398680	Yeah.
398680	399760	What was the algorithm?
399760	405560	Just because you said to penny algorithm planning, um, yeah.
405560	411520	So if you, I guess things like, uh, reinforcement learning use some form of this, um, we're like
411520	415680	in an alpha code has like an evaluation of board states and some kind of Monte Carlo
415680	418280	tree search to search among the game tree.
418760	424280	Um, and, uh, there, there's other algorithms like, like there's, there's like in, in simpler
424280	430880	logical, um, problems you can do, do like back chaining to start from a goal state and
430880	433840	ask like, what, what is the state before the goal state looked like?
434160	437280	And then like, what does the state before that look like and try to get back to your current state?
