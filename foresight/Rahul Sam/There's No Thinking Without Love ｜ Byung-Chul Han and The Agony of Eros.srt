00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Speaking of David, I would like to revisit the the agony of heroes because this is certainly I

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,720
think but I think it's the same for you burnout and agony of heroes are my favorite. I've only read

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,160
probably four or five of his books. So I certainly love this book. One point I want to make about

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,120
the the agony of heroes and I don't know what your thoughts on this are.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,560
So we talk a lot about this like the other and how the other can be a complete alien other and

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,680
then they kind of disturb our sameness, our controlled life. But I really like the kind

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,120
of the notion that Alan Bajor makes that yes, it's true that the other is completely alien.

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,240
You can never plan the love event in that sense. But when when when when two love he says love

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,720
takes two and in the event of love by allowing yourself to like opening yourself up to the other

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,960
there is a higher truth or a newer truth created. So love becomes a project in that sense. So it's

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,560
not that the other is a complete alien and then you know your life is complete chaos. But through

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,720
this again it's paradoxically through opening yourself up to this other you in some sense you

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,520
find a truth even about yourself. And I'm wondering like I don't know if that makes sense. I'm sorry

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,840
if I'm being a bit long winded. No, no, no, no. Just like if you want to comment on that because

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,920
for me that's a beautiful idea of like letting ourselves love and opening us up to the other.

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,160
Yeah, I think maybe something that you also are you're also expressing in that with that sentiment

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:50,720
is the idea that the other is not just outside that it's an inner inner other too that you

18
00:01:50,720 --> 00:02:01,120
discover about yourself. That this logic of sameness is imposition that we do we also impose it on

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:09,360
ourselves. Like the idea of waking up and planning every minute since the moment you wake up until

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
the moment optimizing everything. Optimization is really based based on the assumption that I know

21
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:23,600
myself. I know what I can do and I know what I want to do. But it's a it's a very dull life if I

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,880
operate with the assumption that I know everything about myself I know what I'm what I should do.

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:39,840
So yeah, I agree that it's in our relationships that we find aspects of ourselves that we wouldn't

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:48,000
find. A long time ago I had a friend who is a very close friend and in a moment in the

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,800
sentimental moment she told me if I don't talk with you for too long I will forget who I am.

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,880
And it really made me think I feel I feel like that's a general statement that we could apply

27
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:10,000
to all good friendships and if we don't get in touch with our good friends we will really lose

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,840
touch with ourselves because they they provide us with a place a good friendship or good conversation

29
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,840
it provides provides us with with a place to be to do well get to to to express who we are

30
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:32,080
and then be responded to and in that dialogue we find something and that part of that

31
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:40,000
something is is ourselves but it's not the narcissistic self it's the is the other self

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,760
if you will. Yeah you know and and how have you found because I was going to read out it's a bit

33
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,400
of a mouthful so let me in fact as the book ends the the agony of heroes and I'm so glad you brought

34
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,240
up your friend because the the part I'm going to read is about friendship uh so Bianca Lan ends

35
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,400
the the book saying the philosopher is a friend a lover here the lover is not an

36
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,640
outward personality uh an empirical circumstance but a presence that is intrinsic to thought

37
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:20,960
the condition of possibility of thought itself a living category a transcendental lived reality

38
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,880
and this is perhaps my favorite part because this idea of thinking uh thinking in the strong

39
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,480
sense begins with heroes to be able to think one must first have been a friend a lover

40
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:43,520
without heroes thinking loses all vitality and turmoil and becomes repetitive and reactive

41
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:53,280
heroes uh infuses thinking with desire for the atopic other so you know and this your friend

42
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,680
said that um she she kind of forgets even who she is unless she's in dialogue with you and I

43
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,680
I'd say I have a lot of friends in my life where I do know if I don't talk to them eventually I

44
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:14,080
start forgetting even who I am I love that line thank you for reading that to be able to think

45
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:24,560
one must first have been a friend a lover it's so true and it you know because people who have

46
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,560
an interest in philosophy and have been involved with philosophy for years they might forget that

47
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,840
that it didn't begin with an interest in a given book or a philosophical question

48
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,560
it began as maybe in a context of a relationship with the teacher or with a friend with a person

49
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:53,600
who seemed very intriguing uh there was friendliness there at the bottom and uh that's why a lot of

50
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,960
times philosophical questions begin with a line of thought with something like uh what is love

51
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,680
what is true love or or you know in some movies characters ask each other can men and women really

52
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,480
be just friends and you know that's you have a relationship with someone and within that within

53
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:19,120
the context of a relationship friendship those questions are are posed yeah you know but the

54
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,360
engine of those questions is their relationship that's the idea but it's so easy to forget that

55
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,400
and that that itself is also interesting that we forget
