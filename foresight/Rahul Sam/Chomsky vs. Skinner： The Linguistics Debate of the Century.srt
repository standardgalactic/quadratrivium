1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
You said that it was, well, initially human nature or

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,480
understanding human nature, but also reading Chomsky, which is

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,480
clear from reading your work, your, I don't want to call you a

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,640
Chomsky, and that's like a crass fear of putting it, but it

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,760
seems like you're settling more on, let's say, Chomsky side over

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,180
someone like BF Skinner. And so if I would, if you don't mind, I

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,920
would love for you to sort of elucidate this ongoing, I don't

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,160
want to call it a war, but debate between the Skinner side

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,160
and Chomsky side. And in fact, in one podcast, you even said

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,600
that this debate is still ongoing. It's not like it's

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,520
Yeah, yeah, very much so. Nothing, nothing changes.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,560
Yeah, there's not a conclusion. This is the answer sort of

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,040
thing, which is which is what's lovely about science in my

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,960
view. So what's this debate in linguistics and cognitive

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,200
science between Chomsky and Skinner?

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,560
So that debate at the time was how to explain behavior and

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,760
generally in linguistic behavior in particular, and Skinner was

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,320
hoping to explain that in terms of properties of the information

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,000
that's available to us, what's out there in the environment and

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,800
responses and the links between them and associations that we

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,280
formed between them. And basically, the idea is that to

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,080
explain how we behave, which is all he cared about, all we need

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,800
to do is look at the properties of what's out there rather than

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,480
what the organism brings internally to that how the

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,920
organism views the stimulus and how the organism chooses to

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,120
response. And what Chomsky made very clear is that the study of

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,400
behavior ought to start with the study of the organism, it's

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,440
really kind of maybe you can think about it as a form of

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,080
biology thinking about what is it that the organism brings with

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,080
themselves to to this task. So to make it very, you know, very

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,520
concrete. So why is it that, you know, you you understand a

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,080
sentence, how is it, you know, that you have a sentence such as

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,480
John is eager to please? How do you know that it's John? Who is

34
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,320
being pleased? Being pleased? Whereas if you know, John is

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,880
easy to please, then sorry, put it the other way around. So if

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,000
John is easy to please, it is the one who is being pleased is

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,840
John, whereas if John is eager to please, then he is pleasing

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,600
Bill or somebody else, right? And what Chomsky made clear is

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,080
that interpretations such like that, the only way to make sense

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,800
of them is to figure out what is it that the person knows about

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,760
language and how they encode information that's available to

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,640
them. Any pointed out that our ability to do so to encode

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,400
information that's available to us is constrained in part by

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,520
innate principles of language that he called Universal

45
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,000
Grammar.

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,800
And would you say that's sort of something like innate knowledge

47
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,840
that you write about in this book?

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So as I read Chomsky, this is primarily a

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,040
treatise on human nature and about innate knowledge, which he

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,000
happened to advance in the domain of language. But I always read

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,160
him as a philosopher, essentially.

52
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,920
Certainly, yeah, I mean, he in fact, I believe he was the he

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,720
chaired the Department of Philosophy at MIT, probably for a

54
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
long time. So he has a really good background in philosophy

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,280
certainly.

56
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,720
I was professor so with the idea of Universal Grammar, I've

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,920
always always been thinking about that idea like is is Universal

58
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,360
Grammar itself, this type of innate knowledge? And is it

59
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,480
something that that we can sort of study analytically?

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Oh, and empirically,

61
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,680
empirically, beautiful. And I would say experimentally. Yeah,

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,040
so. So all you need is to start with a good theory of what you

63
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,800
think Universal Grammar is all about. And then go to the lab and

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,920
try to figure out, do you have evidence for this thing? And it's

65
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,480
not easy, but it's doable.

66
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,320
I see, I see. So if we could play a bit of devil's advocate,

67
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,000
because I've read, in fact, apart from Chomsky's political

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,760
work, of course, I've read his book on language, which was which

69
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,320
was an excellent read. And I found it quite hard to read as an

70
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,080
ear five, to be totally honest. But I do know there are certain

71
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,240
people still in the field, as you said, it's an ongoing debate

72
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,400
that kind of are either critical or disagree with some of

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,200
Chomsky's ideas, or let's say, values of Universal Grammar. So

74
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,000
what are what are the current criticisms of this idea of innate

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,560
knowledge or Universal Grammar?

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,080
So to make it clear, I think that in fact, the majority of the

77
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,200
field no longer thinks that no longer sides with Chomsky. I'm

78
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,640
not totally convinced in my reading of the evidence that

79
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,440
that's right. And that's the right conclusion. And the debate

80
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,640
as a debates, as I see it in the domain of language, have always

81
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:51,400
structured, or have always centered onto issues. One is,

82
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,040
what is the machinery that you need to represent language? So

83
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,400
what kind of representations that you have? And what, and what

84
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,000
and do they are they structured? Are they structured in a

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,800
systematic way? Do you need something that is akin to

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,800
algebraic rules? Or all you have is basically associations,

87
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,680
very rich set of associations, which apparently this is what

88
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,320
GPT is doing, you know, AI is doing today. So A is what kind of

89
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,680
representations do you have? And do you need explicit structure

90
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,560
in your data, so to speak? The second question is, where these

91
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,000
representations, and the rules, the way you operate over these

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,400
representations, where is all this machinery coming from? And

93
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,400
is it in parts specific to language? So are you born with

94
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,080
some principles that are unique to language? And that's what

95
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,920
allows you to acquire language? Or are you relying entirely on

96
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,960
generic mechanisms that operate across domains? So what is

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,360
your machinery? And how specific it is, where and where it's

98
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,760
coming from? These are have always been the questions. And

99
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:20,120
the debate these days are centered on a whether there

100
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,960
are in fact algebraic rules. So this is huge debate about that,

101
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,280
which has been increased and confounded by the rise of AI,

102
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,400
because proponents of that state, like, look, you have the

103
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,280
systems that seem to do just fine. And it's not clear. But

104
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,000
some people, there is a question of whether they in fact have

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,960
any algebraic representations at all. And the range of

106
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,520
possibilities range between those who say, there aren't any

107
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,280
structured representations in there at all, or that maybe

108
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,400
they start without them, and they grow them somehow. And all

109
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,240
this becomes really difficult to tell, just because there is so

110
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,640
much data that these systems are exposed to that it's really hard.

111
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,200
So one of the tests that you know, how do you know that there

112
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,640
is an algebraic rules? One of the way to test it is to look at

113
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,320
generalizations, can you generalize to items that are not

114
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,320
similar to anything that you've seen before. But if you're

115
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,880
basically your data set includes everything that we have, then

116
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,840
it becomes very difficult to know whether you'd in fact

117
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,320
generalize or not. So that makes the whole question of

118
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,360
machinery very difficult to decide. Questions of innateness

119
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,200
are difficult to decide for two reasons. A, the success of AI

120
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,440
that kind of presents a big challenge. The other reason is

121
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,360
oftentimes when you point out that there are universals

122
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,360
across languages. So this is one of the main argument or an

123
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,360
important argument to foreign aidness is to argue that, hey,

124
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,560
we look at language after language, and they all show a

125
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,280
certain property. So in my work, we looked at syllable

126
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,720
structure and the fact that languages prefer structures

127
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,920
such as blog to structures such as all bog, LBOG. That seems

128
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,760
very clear. But the thing about this as well as many other

129
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,520
preferences is that there is a correlation between what

130
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,600
languages like to do and what the functional pressures of our

131
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,640
body dictate. So if I ask my undergraduates why blog, then

132
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,560
everybody tells me that what to say. And then intuitive theory

133
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,400
behind it is that it's those functional pressures, meaning

134
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,080
how is it is for you to say the constraints on your

135
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,440
articulatory system and an audition that they're driving

136
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,240
the force. And in every area of language universal, I don't

137
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,920
in many areas of linguistic universals, you find such

138
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,480
correspondences between what languages like to do and some

139
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,520
functional explanation. Phonology is probably the area where you

140
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,480
see those things most clearly. But nowadays, people are

141
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,020
exploring those ideas elsewhere as well. And the problem is that

142
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,540
when people find those correlations, they assume

143
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:37,080
causation, meaning they if you find any functional explanation

144
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,760
of what's going on, people kind of jump to the conclusion that

145
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,400
it's this functional cause, or functional factor that is

146
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,120
causing the structure that you see. So in this specific case,

147
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,640
why do you prefer a blog? Because it's easy to say, or

148
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,960
because it's easy to hear. That's what my undergraduates

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,280
think. And so do professional scientists. And to me, it's not

150
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,240
a done deal. To me, this is an empirical question that you need

151
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,200
to go and explore as indeed we have. And there are ways to do

152
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,320
so. So the fact that you find correlation in principle is

153
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,560
ambiguous between two explanations. One is, it's not

154
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,560
language, it's not your G, it's the functional system, the

155
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,760
sensory and motor systems that are driving the cart here,

156
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,160
that's what makes language the way it is. But the alternative

157
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,640
possibility is, well, maybe it is abstract linguistic principles

158
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,320
that are doing the driving, except for those principles are

159
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,120
not entirely crazy, they're not entirely arbitrary, rather, they

160
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,240
have evolved so that they optimize those sensory and

161
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,160
motor pressures, which I don't think is super surprising. So

162
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,920
that predicts that yes, you will find some correlation between

163
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,320
you know, putative UG and those sensory and motor pressures,

164
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,480
but not but what's doing the pushing was doing what's

165
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,680
pushing the cart, so to speak, is UG rather than sensory motor

166
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,680
system. And merely showing a correlation doesn't adjudicate

167
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,480
between these possibilities. So in my work, we took it very

168
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,320
seriously. So, for example, to figure out whether it's blog

169
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,840
that's doing it, I'm sorry, whether the preference for

170
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,560
blog is coming from, it's easier for you to say than in

171
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,200
collaboration with my colleague, Alvaro Pascualeone, who is a

172
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,600
neuroscientist who does transcarnial magnetic stimulation,

173
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,960
what we did is zapped the motor system that controls the

174
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,480
articulators, the leap specifically, and looked at what

175
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,640
this is doing to your linguistic preferences. And

176
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,880
conversely, what happens when you zap brokers area and what we

177
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,160
found is a dissociation between them. So the point is, these

178
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,560
are questions that you need to explore, you may or may like may

179
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,280
not like the evidence that we produced, I think they're clear,

180
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,480
but the my point is not to defend the solution, but rather to

181
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,320
defend the method. I am very concerned about that time to

182
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,280
jump from correlations to causation, I think this needs

183
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,840
to be sorted out. And I think it's this disagreement that is

184
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,200
behind a lot of the ambiguity that we're having in the field

185
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,800
right now.

186
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,880
April first, I did, in fact, read a blog post written on your

187
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,160
work from your lab by Northeastern University. And so

188
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,760
correct me if I'm wrong, in like a very elementary level, if I

189
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,160
could put it this way, is it that you're at the moment claiming

190
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,160
that it's as if these UG or these abstract principles, they

191
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,480
aren't physical, they aren't arbitrary and random, but they've

192
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,880
kind of evolved to suit our existence as home sapiens, the

193
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,320
same way, let's say a physical limb or something has evolved.

194
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,640
Exactly. Yeah, that's the working hypothesis. But again, I

195
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,760
think for me, it's more important to tell people that just

196
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,200
showing a correlation isn't necessarily proof, it's not a

197
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,720
smoking gun of causation. It's more important for me to emphasize

198
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,760
this methodological claim than to push my own interpretation of

199
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,000
the data. So I think that there's, you know, there is

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,560
probably a lot that need to be done, many more controls and to

201
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,000
completely look at this question. And we have contributed some

202
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
but by no means I would argue that we completely resolve the

203
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,880
issue. What really bothers me is that the attempt to view the

204
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,800
correlation and to jump to the conclusion that oh, we know what's

205
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,280
going on. I think that's that's really unfortunate.
