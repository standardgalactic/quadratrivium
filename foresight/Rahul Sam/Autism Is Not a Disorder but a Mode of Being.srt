1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
All right, this is an excellent segue, Leon.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,840
But the problem is, unfortunately, we're short for time.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,160
So forgive me for rushing you with this.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,320
But I think in the forward and in the introduction itself,

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,360
you basically claim, of course, as you highlighted,

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,880
the subjective structures that Freud and Lacan

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,920
identified with neurosis, perversion, and psychosis.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,360
And then in the book, you posit that autism,

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,240
you say is not a pathology, but a mode of being.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,440
So again, I know we're short of short for time,

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
but if you could sort of maybe give us a prelude,

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,840
because obviously to get an understanding of that,

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,840
you got to read the book, but a very elementary prelude

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,680
as to what you mean by firstly, a mode of being,

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,160
and then why you claim that autism is another mode of being

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,880
on top of the ones identified by Freud and Lacan.

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,680
So first, let me say, Rahul, that I don't know.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,040
You can see if your listeners are interested in our talk

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,080
or you yourself, and we can schedule another meeting

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,440
if you want to continue.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,480
I'd be very grateful.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
Yes.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,080
I want to ask you about foreclosure.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,000
And particularly, may you highlight

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,840
the difference between a psychotic flakosha

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,120
and autistic flakosha?

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,200
And I don't think we'll have time today for that.

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,400
So maybe this could be just an introduction.

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,640
And I'd be very grateful if we could reschedule another talk,

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,800
another conversation.

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,520
Sure, sure.

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,280
So that's, I put this on the table,

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,360
so we won't be too stressed for a time, OK?

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,560
Thank you.

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,440
So yeah, I give this idea of a mode of being,

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,240
borrowing this from the phenomenologists, of course,

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,880
this kind of term.

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,360
But I use it a bit differently in the book.

39
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:13,120
And this is the idea that one's particular use of language

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,840
in order to compensate for the inherent schism

41
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,800
between the inner world and the humanized world

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,720
is, for me, a mode of being.

43
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,760
It is a mode of existence.

44
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,360
Because we find our existence in language,

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,920
as you were saying and you were quoting from the book.

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,040
One is does not only find their meaning,

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,840
let's say, in this kind of Satrian way,

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,320
existence prior to meaning that you are born

49
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,160
and then you find who you are or whatever your goals or aims

50
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,160
are at your life.

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,400
We see with you is this expert that you brought,

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,560
is that one is born already endowed with meaning,

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
already determined by language.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,440
And we say it's a name.

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,520
It's these projections that the parents might have on a baby,

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,840
even before it is born.

57
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,800
Today, we have the sonogram and these images of the baby

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,760
and the womb.

59
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,120
People already start having their fantasies

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,880
about even their face structure.

61
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,400
We know if they're a boy or a girl,

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,880
one has already meanings that are stuck to them

63
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,760
before they're born.

64
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:45,840
And so we say one becomes human, one subjectifies,

65
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,360
one is situated in the humanized world

66
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,640
through their use of language, through their relationship

67
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,920
with this language that is alien, that is outside of them,

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,480
that exists prior and will exist after.

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,320
Now, this particular use of language

70
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,280
is a mode of existence because it situates us

71
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,600
in the world, in the social world, in our body,

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,080
in relationship with other people in the world,

73
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,040
in relationship with our own ego.

74
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:25,120
So language is the mode through which one becomes.

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,000
And then neurosis is one of these modes.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,560
And I argue that psychosis and perversion

77
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,080
are also these modes.

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,560
But my point is, and this is where

79
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,240
I think maybe this mode of being steps away

80
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,920
from the Heideggerian design, this mode of being

81
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,000
that Heidegger speaks about, is that I'll be a little blunt.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,960
For me, everyone is developmentally disordered.

83
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,000
They say that autism is a developmental disorder.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,920
This is how it's determined.

85
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,360
If you follow Freud, everyone is necessarily

86
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,960
developmentally disordered.

87
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,240
Freud speaks about the fixation of the drives.

88
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
So the drives are these things that determine our pleasure

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,760
and suffering.

90
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,120
And he says that at a certain point in one's life,

91
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,200
they're fixated, and they stop developing,

92
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,880
uses these words.

93
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,120
They are stopped in the middle of their development.

94
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,160
And then they continue in the same way,

95
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,560
which is not the proper way.

96
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
It is just a way that keeps on functioning.

97
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,320
So everyone is, in a sense, developmentally disordered.

98
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,120
We are born split with this inherent schism that

99
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,960
is unmendable.

100
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,680
We use language to compensate for it.

101
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,880
And as we do something in the development of the drives,

102
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,680
of these things that move us, that color the world,

103
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,840
that make the world, basically, objects

104
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,680
exist in the world when they are invested with libido.

105
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,880
They don't exist when they are not invested.

106
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,960
So basically, this means that the world stops developing,

107
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
in this sense.

108
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,080
So everyone, the neurotic, the psychotic, the perverse,

109
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,600
and the autistic are all developmentally disordered.

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,320
And this is why each of these perspectives

111
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,440
are, let's say, a mode of being.

112
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,360
They're an attitude in relation to reality.

113
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,080
They're a way to do with language.

114
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,880
When I say then that they are distinct,

115
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,280
then I don't make here some kind of an ontological argument.

116
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,720
And this is something that's important to clarify.

117
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,800
I don't mean that here's Woody Allen.

118
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,560
He's neurotic.

119
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,680
Here's Daniel Schreber for its case.

120
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,200
He's psychotic.

121
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,040
And here's, I don't know, Temple Grandin.

122
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,360
She's autistic.

123
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:09,400
I mean that there are different ways to do with language.

124
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:20,280
And these necessitate our attention as analysts.

125
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,520
And it means that working with this particular subject that

126
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,800
has this particular way of doing with language

127
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,400
will dictate situating myself in the transference

128
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,200
in such and such a way, and making such and such

129
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,440
interventions.

130
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,600
And with the psychotic subject, that will not be the case.

131
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,160
Because if I will position myself in the same way,

132
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
that could be catastrophic.

133
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,040
For instance, this is something, again,

134
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,640
it's not a real example, it's just to clarify my point.

135
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,400
So with neurotic, it's important not to answer one's

136
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,440
demands for love many times.

137
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,040
And this also means that you sometimes go on vacation

138
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,920
and you don't really say, look, I'm sorry,

139
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,160
but I have to go and continue.

140
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,200
You say, I'm going.

141
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,280
We see each other in two weeks.

142
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,480
Let's set a date.

143
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,360
Good.

144
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,480
With the psychotic subject, you will not do that.

145
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,640
Because there is a risk for, let's say,

146
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,720
a paranoid thoughts.

147
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
Where is he going?

148
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,360
Is he staying home?

149
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,280
Will he be here?

150
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,760
Is he seeing other people?

151
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,280
Is he actually going to follow me and not tell me?

152
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,640
So with the psychotic, I would say, I'm going for two weeks.

153
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,400
I will be here.

154
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,200
This is my email.

155
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
You can contact me.

156
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I'll be available between these and these hours.

157
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,120
I'll come back on Tuesday and we meet immediately on Wednesday.

158
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,720
And you can write to me if there's a problem

159
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,920
and we can reschedule, et cetera.

160
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,600
So you see that there's a different way

161
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,840
one engages with even the logistical level

162
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,440
of handling an analysis.

163
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,320
So this manifests itself on all the other levels.

164
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,400
So what I'm saying, when I'm saying that autism

165
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,840
is a distinct mode of being, is I'm

166
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,800
saying that one needs to handle an analysis under the hypothesis

167
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,160
of autism in a way that is different than the one

168
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:24,000
that we would do when there is a hypothesis of psychosis,

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,760
perversion, and neurosis.
