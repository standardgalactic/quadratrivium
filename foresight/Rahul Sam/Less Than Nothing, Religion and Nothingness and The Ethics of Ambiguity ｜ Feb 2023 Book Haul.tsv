0	7680	Hey everyone, welcome to my February 2023 book haul video. This is a new series that I started
7680	13760	which is very casual, completely unscripted where I just go through the books that I've bought
13760	19600	for the month. I tend to do a book haul every single month and I thought, hey, why not share
19600	26640	what I'm buying? Hopefully it adds as an impetus or some sort of inspiration for you to read some
26640	32720	of these books and delve into some of these thinkers. I certainly love watching other people's
32720	38480	book haul videos. It's something I get a lot of just, it's kind of like eating fast food for me,
38480	44880	just pure stimulation and pleasure from looking at all the books that people buy because I happen
44880	52080	to be a bibliophile and fanatical one, in fact. And you know, apart from that, I'll probably
52080	58640	will discuss why I chose to buy this particular book in this point in my life, what's the reason
58640	63920	that I'm interested in this particular book or this thinker and whatnot. But again, it's nothing
64880	69680	planned, it's nothing scripted, it's just me, stream of consciousness just talking, that's it.
70960	78240	Without further ado, let's get started. So the first book is Phenomenology, The Basics by
79200	84720	Dan Zahavi, I believe that's how you pronounce his name. I literally found this book over at it.
85760	92160	I kind of went through this before, I think I got a PDF or something, but I did refer to this a
92160	99200	couple of times when I was writing a few essays. And obviously Phenomenology, a topic that I'm
99200	104800	deeply interested in, I think I'm essentially a phenomenologist and many other things, but that's
104800	113600	one thing I am for sure. And though it's funny, I bought this book because I'm currently writing an
113600	123360	essay that I started writing out of sheer annoyance at James Lindsay, this guy is kind of like right
123360	133120	wing anti woke person who said that all phenomenology is so he said that all leftism is just an
133920	140960	is a byproduct. Oh, leftism is inspired by this philosophical phenomenology, which simply asserts
140960	148400	that subjectivity is truth. And I saw that and I thought that is completely not true. That is
148400	154000	just that is that's a that's fake news. And I could really annoyed me, you can probably see even now,
154000	159760	I read this tweet like months ago, but even now I got totally annoyed by that because it's a complete
159760	167360	caricature and mischaracterization of what phenomenology is. And therefore I started writing
167360	174640	this essay called what phenomenology is not. So I want to kind of try to understand phenomenology
175280	181280	by what what it isn't. I feel like it's funny. I think the more I've started to delve into
181280	186560	philosophy and theory, I've realized that sometimes the best way to grok a concept and understand a
186560	193440	concept is by stating what it isn't, instead of stating what it is. In some sense, even at least
193440	200160	for me, it kind of sits better in my mind. So I bought this book, I'm certainly going to get to
200160	207520	this soon. And the reason is because I want to hopefully publish that publish that essay,
209200	214240	perhaps in about two months, because I'm working on another one right now, got too many, too many
215040	219120	essays pulling me from all sides. And you know, I'm really not getting anything done,
219120	224320	unfortunately. That's just something that I tend to worry about quite a lot.
225920	231760	Ah, the pleasures. So that's why I bought this book. It's in fact to write an essay. I want to get
231760	242640	through all the basics as the name suggests. And my next book is an event perhaps a biography of
242640	248320	Jacques Darida by Peter Salomon, a Salomon, sorry, not not Salomon, Peter Salomon. And
248320	256640	this was recommended by R.C. Walden, if I could find the video where he did recommend the book.
259920	266880	So I think it was called R.C. Walden, Continental Philosophy or something. Let me see if I could
266880	273120	find the video. So I love watching R.C. Robin, that's his name, Robin's videos.
274480	278240	David, you have five interesting philosophy books, Continental Edition,
278880	282400	and he recommended the book. I'm pretty sure he recommended this book.
283600	291920	Yes, and even perhaps. So I kind of want to get into Darida and kind of post structuralist
292640	299680	way of thinking. I really at the moment just have like a very, very extremely peripheral,
299680	305840	almost caricatured version of what post structuralism is. And I thought something,
305840	312080	something I really enjoy is, you know, as Nietzsche said, all philosophy is a philosopher's
312080	317360	biography is even before delving into the philosopher, just sorry, the philosophy,
318320	323840	trying getting an idea from where the philosopher's coming from, which is rather
323840	328880	antithetical to what Heidegger said about Aristotle, that he was just someone who was born,
328880	334640	philosophers and died. No, I actually am interested in the philosopher. I don't know why, but
335520	341280	that's who I am. I generally am interested in the thinker and the background as to what,
342080	346640	the background in which the philosophy sits. So not just the thinker itself,
346640	351120	but even the context, the historical context, the culture period, all of that.
352000	355920	So yeah, I'm kind of getting into this. I probably will get down with this first before
355920	360960	getting into this because this is a small, well, I'm assuming it's a bit of a lie to read compared
360960	367920	to like reading theory, say, because it's a biography. But anyway, that's that. The next one
367920	375440	is was a gift. It was Far From the Madden Crowd by Thomas Hardy. I don't own any books by Thomas,
375440	380240	I think at least I don't think I do. And I kind of want to read Thomas Hardy, just like a light
380240	385680	read. I love reading philosophy, but at the same time, I really do want to read a lot more fiction.
386320	394160	But man, I'm just such a theory nerd, you know, I can't help myself. I probably read like one
394720	400320	work. I probably like read like one novel, but even that, like if I read Dostoevsky, for instance,
400320	406000	I want to read it from like a philosophical lens. I can't just read it as a book or as a work of fiction
406720	412800	because I'm such a theory nerd. But nonetheless, this is a book was recommended by a few friends.
412800	416720	I hope that it was quite good. And I hope that it kind of goes into
417440	425200	as the what's this called bibliography state, so vividly portraying the
425840	432160	superstitions and traditions of a small, rural community far from the madden crowd
432160	437760	shows the precarious position of a woman in a man's world. So it certainly seems interesting.
438960	446400	And then this book. Now, The Ethics of Ambiguity by Simone de Beauvoir. Of course, everyone knows
446400	450480	who Simone de Beauvoir is, at least anyone who's marginally interested in philosophy.
452000	455760	Simone de Beauvoir, of course, is known for her magnum opus, the second sex, but
457440	464400	a lot of YouTubers, in fact, philosophy YouTubers that I deeply respect, have recommended this
464400	471840	book because at least from my understanding, I think Simone de Beauvoir has a much more
471920	478640	reasonable, let's say, or I haven't got the word for it, but let's just say
479440	483680	realistic and take that word with a grain of salt. I don't know if that's a proper word.
483680	493600	Realistic, let's say like encapsulation of reality, if that makes sense, or what life is
494160	500960	for a human being, for a design. Because you know, Jean-Paul Sartre, he kind of
501600	505120	has this idea of like the transcendent consciousness that is free-floating,
505120	510720	consciousness everywhere. But given that Simone de Beauvoir was a woman in a time where I believe
510720	515360	when she was writing, women couldn't even work without getting permission from men or something.
515360	523200	But even in France, it was a very progressive country for the time. Nonetheless,
523760	530400	she lived in a deeply patriarchal system. Therefore, her understanding,
531760	538000	her understanding of what it means to exist in the world, especially being a woman,
538880	542720	I think is a lot more realistic because she talks about this kind of contradiction between
542720	547680	being a free being, but also the fact that we are, in fact, in a structure, in a society,
548240	554960	in a historical period, we also have this kind of, there's a word by
555840	561440	po-to-lik, there's a term by po-to-lik. Let me try to look it up because I just referred to it.
569200	574480	It's in this, oh, I think it was masculinity and nothingness. Yes, so in this essay I did quote
574480	584080	po-to-lik. Let me see if I could find it. Man is essentially finite freedom. This idea of finite
584080	594400	freedom, that doesn't mean we're not free, but our freedom comes within a certain structure that,
594400	601440	in some sense, makes the freedom infinity. It's not like this free-floating Sartrean consciousness
601520	607840	that we just can do whatever we want. Perhaps Sartre wrote from a position of privilege,
607840	614320	being a man in France in his time. Simone de Beauvoir had a different experience being a woman.
615600	624240	This book beautifully captures that ambiguity to existence, this kind of almost antagonism
624240	630320	of what it means to be human, and then, of course, the ethical and moral implications that come from
630400	635920	it. So I'm really keen to get into this. This is probably going to go right to the top of my list
635920	644880	of books to read. Perhaps once I'm done with this one, because I'm writing an essay, I'll probably
644880	651280	get on this. So suddenly excited to read The Ethics of Pembergute by Simone de Beauvoir.
652080	660800	And then comes the next one. So it's This Big Boy, Less Than Nothing by my hero,
660800	668720	Slavoj Džek. This is a book that I will jump into this year for sure. The reason being,
669280	676160	this year I kind of set myself a goal in terms of my education and my studying
676160	688160	in philosophy. It was to deeply study two of, well, I would say the two main thinkers that
688160	694880	have influenced my life to this moment in the deepest possible way. Portolek and, of course,
694880	702160	Slavoj Džek. So studying these two thinkers, of course, means studying all the other thinkers
702160	708400	that influenced them. So it's a huge project that I've set for myself. And I want to embark on it.
708400	715600	And I'm kind of already embarked on it, let's say. And that means going through essentially
716720	723520	the magnum opuses. So for Portolek it would be, I probably would be systematic theology,
723520	729200	the monograph. It's got three volumes. And I own it too. I just am slowly getting through that.
729200	734000	But then for Slavoj Džek, a lot of people who read Džek quite deeply recommend this book
734720	741120	and the parallax view. So this is his book on Hegel. Hegel and the shadow of dialectical
741120	745280	materialism. So this is certainly something I'm going to jump into soon because I won't
745280	750640	get a better understanding of Hegel. I don't know. It's funny. I just had a conversation with
751200	757040	P.F. Young, a great guy, Paul. And I realized that I was trying to explain to him the Hegelian
758080	763360	triad. And I think I totally butchered it. I wasn't even sure if I should take that bit out
763360	769760	because I didn't want to misrepresent Hegel. But I just thought, hey, look, it's a conversation.
769760	775040	We were just chatting. It was really casual. So if I'm just spewing bullshit,
775040	780320	someone will correct me and if I'm not, I'll hopefully correct myself sometime in the future
780320	786480	when I have a better understanding of Hegel. So definitely I'm going to work on this. In fact,
787040	794240	if it's possible, it's a big boy. I might even do a lecture series on this book
795040	802320	if it's within my capacity because, man, it's a lot to get through. The next one is
802320	810320	Religion and Nothingness by Nishitani, Keiji Nishitani. Of course, a book that
810320	815600	John Oveiki has recommended many times. In fact, in his latest lecture series, which is
818160	826000	what was it? After Socrates, is it? Oveiki. Yes, in his lecture series,
826880	835440	I think in episode five, he states that this was in the top five books that he's read.
836160	842000	And John Oveiki is also someone I really like. I really enjoy listening to his work.
842000	850800	Despite interestingly, I think theoretically, his point of views or his understanding of reality
850880	857040	is a lot more different to the other thinker that I would consider myself a Zhezhekian.
857040	866240	So, Zhezhek and John Oveiki probably have this fundamental conflict in their theories.
868080	873840	It's interesting just to go for a bit of a tangent here. I think a lot of the modern debate
873920	881440	between different intellectuals is kind of between Freud, and then there's Jung, and then there's
881440	888640	Lacan. And I think it's between these three thinkers. So, everyone influenced by Freud,
888640	893440	Jung, Lacan, they go their own way and create their own philosophies. And that's where the conflict
893440	899440	lies. So, John Oveiki would probably be more of a union, less than a Freudian, and then
900000	906720	Zhezhek would be more of a Freudian and Lacanian. So, or Lacanian. So, that's where the conflict lies.
908880	915280	Nonetheless, just thinking out loud here. The next book is Capital by Thomas Piketty.
917520	924640	I listened to a recent episode on Pillspawd. I love this channel so much. I don't know the
924640	932480	guy's real name. I don't think he probably goes by his pseudonym online, Pillspawd. And they
933200	941120	had this episode where they talk about, it's called the idea of communism. It's very interesting. It
941120	946880	was in fact done on a, I believe, an event that Alan Baizho and a few other thinkers, you know,
946880	951040	mainstream leftists, or the popular leftist intellectuals of our time, got together and
951040	955680	discussed the idea of communism. So, it's important to understand here. It's the word idea. That's
955680	960080	the concept of communism. It's not about the practical implementations. Different thing.
961760	969360	And they did mention this book. Not Pillspawd, but another guest on the podcast did mention
969360	975680	this book, Capital by Thomas Piketty. And I know it's another big one. I don't know if I'll get
975680	982320	into it this year. Hopefully. Definitely, I want to first get through the next book on Hegel.
982320	988160	But maybe after that, I'll get into this book. And the reason I like it is because,
988160	993200	as much as I love philosophy and concepts, I also do look for, you know, practical material
993200	997440	implementations of these concepts. It's something, you know, I think, as a person who's politically
997440	1002080	involved has to think about, it can't all be philosophizing at one point. It has to be
1002080	1008560	implementation. This is perhaps my engineering side coming in. And they discussed that Thomas Piketty
1008560	1017120	just gives some very tangible, practical solutions as to how we can live in a post-capitalist
1017120	1024320	society. As to how we can implement new systems that make society more egalitarian and ensure
1024320	1031040	that there's less suffering in this world. And it's a new way of thinking about capital,
1031040	1035840	as the name suggests, in the 21st century, because we do live in a post-capitalist society.
1035840	1041680	And I think society is, you know, I mean, over here, I'm a complete jirkeen. I think the only
1041680	1047520	universal is conflict. I think the only universal is antagonism. So in some sense, in a very
1047520	1053200	Nietzschean way, society is about constantly recreating ourselves and then broader society.
1053200	1060560	There never is the good old days, nor will there ever be the utopia that some people might aspire
1060560	1071120	to have. Therefore, there never is the end of history. That never happens, as Francis Fukuyama
1072480	1078560	suggested. At least that's my current understanding. And that's it. Those are the books. I hope you all
1078560	1086000	enjoyed this book haul. Sorry if I'm blabbering. I kind of did that intentionally because, well,
1086000	1090320	this is not a scripted thing. It's just me thinking out loud here. And if there are any other books,
1090400	1098400	that you think are, let's say, tangentially related to these books that I discussed, please do leave
1098400	1103840	them down in the comment section. And I'll be keen to check them out and perhaps even end up buying
1103840	1108800	them. But thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next one, not only the next book haul, but even
1108800	1116240	in the next video, which probably, well, I've got one on my mother world, the software engineering
1116240	1124480	world where I'm doing on effective Java, which I shall record soon. And then the other one is a,
1125120	1131120	I'm excited for this, actually, a Twitter space that I'll be hosting, not hosting, sorry, I'll be a
1131120	1137040	guest in with my brother, you and go, who I'm hoping to have on the podcast soon because this guy,
1137760	1142720	alone to death, but also the smart bloke. So it would be interesting to have a conversation
1142720	1148720	with him. Cool. See you in the next one. Take care. Cheers.
