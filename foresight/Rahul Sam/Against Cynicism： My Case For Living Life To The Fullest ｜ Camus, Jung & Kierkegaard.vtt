00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
Hey everyone, so in the last couple of years I began to feel this sense of

00:05.040 --> 00:12.300
cynicism and deep pessimism growing in our culture and I'd even say it started

00:12.300 --> 00:18.080
coming into my personal and private life not at a philosophical abstract level

00:18.080 --> 00:23.000
but really in my day-to-day intimate interactions and I started feeling that

00:23.000 --> 00:29.040
viscerally and a part of me was like you got to give the devil his deal you know

00:29.040 --> 00:34.800
I think you can't justify a certain level of cynicism in this world we live in

00:34.800 --> 00:41.200
and that's what inspired this essay you know I write to think and for the

00:41.200 --> 00:46.120
longest time I wrote for myself my private thoughts you know journaling

00:46.120 --> 00:51.640
just taking down notes here and there and I think I finally mastered up the

00:51.640 --> 00:55.320
confidence to start sharing my work publicly you know sharing my writing

00:55.320 --> 01:00.840
publicly even though I tend to ramble a bit so I'm sort of plotting along and

01:00.840 --> 01:06.480
trying to make sense of why I still think despite all the malevolence despite

01:06.480 --> 01:13.640
all the cynicism that is that BCN is justified to a certain level that they

01:13.640 --> 01:18.760
still a case to be made against it a case to be made for living life in the

01:18.760 --> 01:24.880
fullest and deriving meaning out of the world we live in so anyway I hope you

01:24.920 --> 01:29.680
enjoyed this essay it's actually a an essay I wrote for medium and my you know

01:29.680 --> 01:33.400
personal blog and I'm just reading it out because I do know that a lot of people

01:33.400 --> 01:37.840
prefer listening or watching it instead of reading it part of it is obviously

01:37.840 --> 01:43.720
subjective and personal to me but then I also think most of it is really something

01:43.720 --> 01:48.720
that's applicable to all of us that's like an objective truth let's say but

01:48.720 --> 01:53.720
yeah I'm keen to hear your thoughts I hope you enjoy it let's get to it now

01:54.360 --> 02:00.080
against cynicism my case for living life to the fullest

02:02.600 --> 02:07.840
to my partners annoyance I have a running joke I make at social gatherings

02:07.840 --> 02:14.560
about wanting to have 10 kids one day enough to play a 515 basketball game I

02:14.560 --> 02:20.800
tell myself the reason behind the joke is for some engaging befuddling humor to

02:20.800 --> 02:24.760
lighten up the mood in a room even though it mostly leaves me having to

02:24.760 --> 02:30.600
explain the joke awkwardly and even then most people do not find it funny yet

02:30.600 --> 02:34.640
the more I think about it I feel as if this is something my heart truly

02:34.640 --> 02:41.240
desires to have many kids probably not 10 and become a father someday hopefully

02:41.240 --> 02:46.880
a good one as the adage goes there's a grain of truth in every joke but then I

02:46.920 --> 02:52.440
think why would I want to do something that absurdly impractical when evidence

02:52.440 --> 02:56.760
suggests that as people get more educated they tend to have fewer children

02:56.760 --> 03:01.320
why would I want to go against the tide leaving aside the ridiculous number of

03:01.320 --> 03:06.760
kids why even bring a child into this God for second world scourged by climate

03:06.760 --> 03:15.240
change pandemics a lamentable economy and alarming social unrest how selfish

03:15.520 --> 03:20.520
and cruel of us to inflict such inevitable misery onto another human

03:20.520 --> 03:25.560
being by bringing them into this world and even worse what if my posterity

03:25.560 --> 03:30.920
becomes totalitarian and deceitful tyrants who end up exacerbating the

03:30.920 --> 03:35.720
agony of people I've heard people say that loving a child is sacrificial and

03:35.720 --> 03:42.960
such selfless love is the highest of all virtues utter nonsense one could argue

03:43.000 --> 03:47.400
as it looks to me that most people willingly have children leaving aside

03:47.400 --> 03:53.600
the accidents only to overcome the soul sucking banality of their life and don't

03:53.600 --> 03:59.320
get me started on love sheer boredom drives us to find love it is a self

03:59.320 --> 04:05.360
centered facade of intimacy even the unconditional love of God is conditional

04:05.360 --> 04:11.280
as he necessitates for repentance prior to our salvation if God truly loved

04:11.320 --> 04:16.960
his children why couldn't he just forgive us instead of sacrificing his own son

04:16.960 --> 04:21.640
for atonement most people deceive themselves of being in love only when

04:21.640 --> 04:26.120
it's passion and their absolute inability to live with themselves that

04:26.120 --> 04:30.440
prepidatiously hold together their relationship it's why John Baptiste

04:30.440 --> 04:36.600
Clemens recognized in Albert canons the fall of course true love is exceptional

04:36.640 --> 04:42.400
two or three times a century more or less the rest of the time there's vanity

04:42.400 --> 04:48.440
or boredom even if let's say love doesn't have to entail a higher virtue over

04:48.440 --> 04:55.480
mere passion and all love necessitates is just that passion alone is in passion

04:55.480 --> 05:00.240
itself a selfish pursuit supposed a man or woman audaciously follows their

05:00.240 --> 05:05.560
dreams and aspirations in that case it seems like an awfully privileged

05:05.920 --> 05:10.520
position handed to them by society and most people in the world wouldn't have

05:10.520 --> 05:15.920
that fortune some may even say aspiration is for the spoil and ungrateful

05:15.920 --> 05:21.240
desiring something more than being satisfied with the life they're given

05:21.240 --> 05:26.600
as I've demonstrated above being cynical towards life isn't difficult but the

05:26.600 --> 05:31.960
only question really worth asking is what to do after we've rationalized our

05:32.000 --> 05:39.240
sense system that's what I try to deal with in this essay a caveat questioning

05:39.240 --> 05:44.240
the answerable can leave us in a grim place the angst it brings makes us

05:44.240 --> 05:49.440
bitter, misanthropic and implacable hence it's not surprising that we

05:49.440 --> 05:55.160
intentionally repress these gratuitous thoughts and cling to what the rest of

05:55.160 --> 06:00.240
society does with their lives the social zeitgeist protects us from insanity

06:00.680 --> 06:05.040
it's more comforting to distract ourselves with a political or celebrity

06:05.040 --> 06:10.240
scandal rather than looking into the festering wounds in our own lives and

06:10.240 --> 06:15.960
reality itself at least for myself have it to I have been rather fortunate in my

06:15.960 --> 06:23.120
life a lot of unearned good has come my way mostly through those I love and yet

06:23.120 --> 06:29.040
these existential questions haunt me despite my good luck I have spent

06:29.040 --> 06:33.040
countless nights trying to integrate my serendipity with the world's

06:33.040 --> 06:43.080
unjust cruelty how dare I benefit from unmerited happiness it's not gratitude I

06:43.080 --> 06:49.880
feel but a peculiar type of consternation at life I swear you gentlemen

06:49.880 --> 06:55.520
that to be overly conscious is a sickness a real tarot sickness

06:55.520 --> 07:00.720
Voidol Dostoevsky even while I'm writing this piece I question my

07:00.720 --> 07:06.040
privilege and impertinence in asking such nonsensical questions about love

07:06.040 --> 07:13.120
marriage and passion a part of myself is still yelling at me go do some work

07:13.120 --> 07:20.840
hippie these aren't questions one should bother asking last year a friend of mine

07:20.840 --> 07:26.360
unexpectedly passed away she was a beautiful soul her funeral was in

07:26.360 --> 07:31.560
Sri Lanka and I couldn't attend it because I live in Australia but I saw her

07:31.560 --> 07:40.080
wailing parents through the funeral livestream how cruel is the caprice of

07:40.080 --> 07:46.240
life I thought and how arbitrary is the nature of suffering I particularly

07:46.240 --> 07:52.720
remember her mom when I was growing up in Sri Lanka she was a loving and kind

07:52.720 --> 08:00.960
lady what has she done to deserve such so crushing sorrow of losing a child how

08:00.960 --> 08:06.160
could nature be so malignant my friend's death was a clear rebuttal of how life

08:06.160 --> 08:11.760
ought to be as I was told parents aren't supposed to bury their children but it

08:11.760 --> 08:15.720
ought to be the other way around I sit here in my comfortable apartment

08:15.720 --> 08:21.360
typing and philosophizing away on my nifty computer wondering if I dug

08:21.360 --> 08:27.320
myself into a hole too deep how privileged am I to dig this hole of my

08:27.320 --> 08:32.560
own free will when my parents when my friend's parents were pushed into it by

08:32.560 --> 08:38.520
the faded tragedy of life however privilege or misfortune angst or

08:38.520 --> 08:44.960
gratitude aren't justifiable reasons to evade and hide from such questions we

08:44.960 --> 08:50.000
shouldn't give way to the pretense and at times distractions of mundane life

08:50.000 --> 08:55.960
that we all use to cushion ourselves from the existential blows of living nor

08:55.960 --> 09:01.200
should we neolistically succumb to fatalistic resentment both these forms

09:01.200 --> 09:06.840
of living are out of cowardice once a question is asked not as a mere

09:06.840 --> 09:13.800
utterance but as an but as an authentic form of being itself and how we live

09:13.840 --> 09:19.000
through our actions emotions words desires or whatever constitutes an

09:19.000 --> 09:25.720
individual no reason we used to hide from such questions are adequate unless we

09:25.720 --> 09:30.320
confront truth regardless of the consequences these questions will

09:30.320 --> 09:35.520
enduringly haunt us forever every objection I brought up against children

09:35.520 --> 09:41.640
or procreation marriage love passion and even gold salvation can be rebuked

09:41.880 --> 09:47.360
through cogent arguments inferred from numerous intellectual propositions

09:47.360 --> 09:52.720
and syllogisms a few ad hoc examples environmental activists Mike

09:52.720 --> 09:58.960
Schellenberger makes a systematic case in his book apocalypse never as to why we

09:58.960 --> 10:03.480
should be more optimistic about climate change and not capitulate to

10:03.480 --> 10:07.600
anti-human sentiments such as not having children because of the environment

10:07.920 --> 10:12.080
he emphasizes we should focus on humanitarian development and elevating

10:12.080 --> 10:16.600
people from poverty as this has proven to be one of the best remedies for

10:16.600 --> 10:20.760
imminent environmental problems the following tweet thread succinctly

10:20.760 --> 10:25.360
highlights his worry about young people not wanting to have children due to

10:25.360 --> 10:32.960
climate change I should stipulate that my intention behind using Schellenberger's

10:33.000 --> 10:38.360
ideas as an example wasn't me taking a political stance on the matter of

10:38.360 --> 10:44.080
climate change I stand neutral on the complicated subject as I'm grossly

10:44.080 --> 10:49.280
uninformed about its nuances a big lie that pathologize society since the

10:49.280 --> 10:55.040
1960s with the publication of books such as the population bomb is a myth of

10:55.040 --> 11:00.360
dangerous overpopulation that lead to global famine and environmental

11:00.480 --> 11:06.480
catastrophe up till now these radical claims seem unsubstantiated for

11:06.480 --> 11:12.080
instance Lehman Stone from Vox states in his article why he shouldn't obsess

11:12.080 --> 11:18.560
about overpopulation lowering US carbon intensity by about a third to around the

11:18.560 --> 11:24.280
level of manufacturing superpower Germany today has a bigger effect than

11:24.280 --> 11:30.400
preventing 100 million Americans from existing there's only one way to

11:30.400 --> 11:35.240
effectively prevent alleviate or reverse dangerous climate change

11:35.240 --> 11:40.960
technological geographic and social advancement population has little to do

11:40.960 --> 11:47.200
with it especially not in the US despite the terrible consequences of COVID-19

11:47.200 --> 11:52.200
we also made unprecedented progress in epidemiology and vaccination

11:52.200 --> 11:56.880
development while I'm not reducing the suffering people went through due to the

11:56.880 --> 12:02.400
pandemic modern medicines expedition is a scientific miracle we've seen in the

12:02.400 --> 12:08.040
last few months UCLA health reports in a remarkable achievement of medical

12:08.040 --> 12:12.480
science we've gone from identifying a new pathogen discovering an immune

12:12.480 --> 12:18.200
response against it to developing and testing a safe and effective vaccine for

12:18.200 --> 12:24.360
it in less than 12 months previously the fastest vaccination to go from

12:24.360 --> 12:30.200
development to deployment was the mom's vaccine in the 1960s which took about four

12:30.200 --> 12:38.000
years all these developments were obviously done by human beings therefore

12:38.000 --> 12:43.080
using the pandemic as an example we could extrapolate the remedy to every other

12:43.080 --> 12:48.280
problem we face including social unrest unfavorable economic conditions

12:48.280 --> 12:55.120
environmental issues etc the answers lie in people the more talented people who

12:55.120 --> 13:00.480
come to live the most solutions we will find through their skills looking through

13:00.480 --> 13:06.320
a pure utilitarian ethical lens we need a bigger talent pool provided they have

13:06.320 --> 13:12.800
equal opportunity to create more value in this world or crassly stating we need

13:12.800 --> 13:19.400
more people to exploit more good from humanity for the world however pure

13:19.400 --> 13:24.080
talent alone isn't what makes an individual remarkable it's a combination

13:24.080 --> 13:28.400
of exceptional character and innate ability in their respective attitudes

13:28.400 --> 13:34.720
therefore such excellence is rare and the only way to increase our plane of

13:34.720 --> 13:39.920
serendipity is to increase the number of human beings the individual being a

13:39.920 --> 13:45.680
central part of creation is an unbelievably ancient ideal it runs deep

13:45.680 --> 13:50.200
into the mythology and stories that hold our cultures specifically the

13:50.200 --> 13:55.280
Western world together the individual is the correct level of analysis as there

13:55.280 --> 14:00.600
is a fundamental truth that speaks to a human beings sacredness and sublimity it

14:00.600 --> 14:05.280
speaks so deeply that we couldn't even dare to question its validity for the

14:05.320 --> 14:11.000
longest time in human history it would be considered sinful the book of Genesis

14:11.000 --> 14:17.360
explicitly stating Imago day gold created man in his own image is a

14:17.360 --> 14:23.320
proclamation of humanity being endowed by the divine to bring forth a new

14:23.320 --> 14:30.200
reality into being the proposition of Imago day is a metaphysical problem that

14:30.200 --> 14:35.520
philosophers are still trying to comprehend fully yet most modern

14:35.520 --> 14:41.680
societies are undergirded by the concept of human rights which we invariably

14:41.680 --> 14:47.360
cannot violate even the most obtruse and esoteric objections I put forward

14:47.360 --> 14:52.880
earlier about gold salvation has been theologically dealt with by philosophers

14:52.880 --> 14:57.760
such as William Lane Craig and Alvin Pantinger if you're interested in the

14:57.760 --> 15:02.640
subject Dr. Craig recently wrote a whole book on the necessity for the death of

15:02.640 --> 15:08.440
Christ for humanity's sins called atonement and the death of Christ and

15:08.440 --> 15:13.040
exegetical historical and philosophical exploration additionally I could

15:13.040 --> 15:17.160
recommend books like Enlightenment now by Stephen Pinker or the rational

15:17.160 --> 15:22.720
optimist by Matt Ridley where both authors argue that humanity has made

15:22.720 --> 15:27.400
unprecedented progress in the last few centuries they're confident we are on

15:27.400 --> 15:31.600
the right track in almost every available measure for social and

15:31.600 --> 15:37.160
environmental progress in the past two centuries providing ample evidence to

15:37.160 --> 15:44.640
ascertain their findings from various research domains books such as these

15:44.640 --> 15:50.160
delineate that we don't have to look any further for the miracle of human progress

15:50.160 --> 15:54.880
and advancement than our own history notwithstanding the conspicuous

15:54.880 --> 16:00.040
malvalence we see in humanity nevertheless none of these intellectual

16:00.040 --> 16:05.600
arguments will satisfy the burdens of our souls at least it didn't do so for

16:05.600 --> 16:11.400
mine I could find an infinite amount of philosophies from every domain of thought

16:11.400 --> 16:17.840
known to human epistemology but still leave a persisting void of despair in

16:17.840 --> 16:23.560
our hearts I know this to be certain as however much science and philosophy

16:23.600 --> 16:28.680
intellectually stimulated me it was nothing compared to the most intimate

16:28.680 --> 16:35.040
fulfillment that beauty valor and love brought to my soul life is in another

16:35.040 --> 16:40.200
tried philosophical model instead the models are created in trying to

16:40.200 --> 16:45.800
understand life itself we do not lead our lives by making a priori decisions

16:45.800 --> 16:51.160
weighing the pros and cons similar to a machine learning model that runs on a

16:51.200 --> 16:57.280
supervised set of rules for starters this would undeniably drive us insane and

16:57.280 --> 17:02.800
most saliently at the least we do not even have a proper phenomenological

17:02.800 --> 17:10.640
framework to deal with being we patently exist but this existence isn't the end

17:10.640 --> 17:17.040
itself the question lies in what this existence for human beings entails the

17:17.040 --> 17:22.600
telos could life be a set of propositional deductions masqueraded as

17:22.600 --> 17:28.160
choices or is that too simplistic disregarding copious amounts of modern

17:28.160 --> 17:34.360
scientific research research and a an ancient wisdom found across cultures for

17:34.360 --> 17:41.000
a moment simple observation of regular life will show that seldom do we let

17:41.320 --> 17:48.600
PO empiricism logic and cold rationalism guide our lives nor am I sure if we

17:48.600 --> 17:54.400
should necessarily make rationalism the highest of human virtues contrary to

17:54.400 --> 17:58.360
what the Enlightenment think is proclaimed life can be more accurately

17:58.360 --> 18:04.240
portrayed through inspiration romance intuition serendipity synchronicity and

18:04.240 --> 18:09.280
all those bewildering elements of reality that would be dismissed as

18:09.320 --> 18:16.200
superfluous occultism by modernists none of these metaphysical or spiritual

18:16.200 --> 18:21.880
phenomena that still are meaningful occurrences can be explained through the

18:21.880 --> 18:28.360
modern scientific method and rationalism to make sense of those transcendent

18:28.360 --> 18:34.840
realities we need the arts we need to revivify our fading appreciation for

18:34.840 --> 18:40.920
aesthetics as Oscar Wilde wrote paradox though it may seem and paradoxes are

18:40.920 --> 18:47.280
always dangerous things it is nonetheless true that life imitates art far more

18:47.280 --> 18:53.560
than art imitates life for example to elucidate my point I could use a grim

18:53.560 --> 18:59.200
philosophy called antinatalism utilizing the work of its leading advocate in

18:59.200 --> 19:04.760
contemporary times David Beneter the antinatalist position is that humans

19:04.800 --> 19:09.800
should stain from procreation because it's morally wrong to bring more

19:09.800 --> 19:14.840
children to this world and what if and it would have been better for us to never

19:14.840 --> 19:18.640
have been born in the first place

19:18.640 --> 19:23.960
professor Beneter asserts the following presuppositional asymmetry between

19:23.960 --> 19:29.440
pleasure and pain which the whole philosophy rests on number one the

19:29.440 --> 19:35.960
presence of pain is bad number two the presence of pleasure is good number three

19:35.960 --> 19:42.300
the absence of pain is good even if that pain is not enjoyed by anyone number

19:42.300 --> 19:47.800
four the absence of pleasure is not bad unless they somebody for whom this

19:47.800 --> 19:53.320
absence is a deprivation therefore if human beings cease to exist it still

19:53.360 --> 19:59.880
fulfills point number three and four theoretically miss a really David

19:59.880 --> 20:05.440
Beneter may seem like an evil person is evidently anti-human ideas could be the

20:05.440 --> 20:11.440
same worldviews that motivated nihilistic school shooters and ruthless tyrants

20:11.440 --> 20:18.480
publicly unveiling the human hearts innate malevolence I remember my

20:18.480 --> 20:22.880
emotional reaction to coming across his work how in the world could Oxford

20:22.880 --> 20:29.960
University Press even publish such a reprehensible book yet as I delve into

20:29.960 --> 20:35.360
his work and the individual behind those ideas I discovered a person who isn't

20:35.360 --> 20:41.600
much worse than the rest of us fools he did not have an irrational hatred for

20:41.600 --> 20:46.480
humanity and he certainly wasn't stating that people currently living should be

20:46.480 --> 20:52.280
wiped off the face of the planet in fastical irony he dedicated his book

20:52.560 --> 20:58.560
better never to have been to his progenitor stating to my parents even

20:58.560 --> 21:02.960
though they brought me into existence Beneter is simply an academic

21:02.960 --> 21:07.760
philosopher putting forward a set of ideas similar to what socrates all

21:07.760 --> 21:12.640
the stoics have done historically his assertion isn't particularly novel

21:12.640 --> 21:17.520
either it's something human beings always wondered through a discussion that

21:17.560 --> 21:22.320
goes all the way to the book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament and

21:22.320 --> 21:27.000
I declared that the dead who had already died are happier than the living who are

21:27.000 --> 21:33.320
still alive but better than both is the one who has never been born who has not

21:33.320 --> 21:38.840
seen the evil that is under the sun I'm not a philosopher nor do I care for the

21:38.840 --> 21:44.560
sort of generative philosophy that acts only in the plane of abstractions there's

21:44.560 --> 21:48.920
nothing more convenient than creating asymmetries and inferring conclusions

21:48.920 --> 21:55.560
within a finite set of ad hoc rules where we define the axioms I've lazily done

21:55.560 --> 22:01.000
that even in parts of this essay it's what Albert Camel understood in the

22:01.000 --> 22:06.280
myth of Sisyphus which in my opinion makes him a true and rare philosopher

22:06.280 --> 22:11.120
there is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is

22:11.120 --> 22:17.560
suicide judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering

22:17.560 --> 22:23.000
the fundamental question of philosophy all the rest whether or not the world

22:23.000 --> 22:27.840
has three dimensions whether the mind has nine or twelve categories comes

22:27.840 --> 22:34.840
afterwards these are games one must first answer and if it is true as nature

22:34.840 --> 22:40.240
claims that a philosopher to deserve our respect must preach by example you can

22:40.280 --> 22:45.360
appreciate the importance of that reply for it will proceed the definitive act

22:45.360 --> 22:52.800
these are facts the heart can feel yet they call for careful study before they

22:52.800 --> 22:59.040
can become clear to the intellect was Mike Tyson crassly said everybody has a

22:59.040 --> 23:02.600
plan until they get punched in the mouth

23:02.600 --> 23:08.000
nevertheless despite my objections to conceptualizing life as a philosophical

23:08.040 --> 23:12.920
model and prescribing eschatological judgments on living I will engage in

23:12.920 --> 23:18.200
bentis example for expediency's sake but I will not engage as a philosopher as I

23:18.200 --> 23:23.720
don't think the age-old question that was asked in Hamlet Solakway is a

23:23.720 --> 23:29.560
philosophical one to be or not to be that is the question the fundamental

23:29.560 --> 23:35.600
axiom in asymmetry between pain and pleasure presupposes one that the

23:35.600 --> 23:41.480
presence of pain is bad and to the presence of pleasure is good I disagree

23:41.480 --> 23:47.520
with this presupposition it isn't clear that life can be good only if its pain

23:47.520 --> 23:52.960
is entirely eliminated from being and all and all human beings had was

23:52.960 --> 23:59.000
infinite bliss and pleasure nor does it seem like as Dostoevsky understood

23:59.000 --> 24:06.080
human beings will desire such a mode of living one of my childhood heroes was

24:06.080 --> 24:12.960
Lakshman Kadergama okay a Sri Lankan statesman and a lawyer during his time

24:12.960 --> 24:18.200
as the Minister of Foreign Affairs he was a key figure in Sri Lanka civil war

24:18.200 --> 24:24.080
against the LTE a separatist service organization for example the independent

24:24.080 --> 24:30.000
reported on his vitality for global politics Kadergama was not just any

24:30.000 --> 24:34.880
senior minister he was the highest ranking ethnic Tamil in the government

24:34.880 --> 24:40.400
more than that he was the man who was responsible more than anyone for drying

24:40.400 --> 24:45.760
up international support for the Tamil Tigers the LTE it was his

24:45.760 --> 24:50.840
international campaign that has a tiger's name as a banned terrorist

24:50.840 --> 24:57.400
organization in the US UK and other countries similar to similar awards in

24:57.400 --> 25:03.680
any other country Sri Lanka's conflict has a nuanced and complicated history and

25:03.680 --> 25:10.600
yet most Sri Lankans would unequivocally agree LK was a national hero he was

25:10.600 --> 25:16.240
posthumously awarded the highest national honor Sri Lanka Bhimanya a title

25:16.240 --> 25:23.600
shared by Sir Atsi Clark in hindsight I believe my father giving me LK's

25:23.600 --> 25:28.760
biography to read was the impetus behind my interest in studying politics ethics

25:28.760 --> 25:36.040
and philosophy outstanding his profuse security and protection on August 12th

25:36.040 --> 25:44.200
2005 LK was assassinated by an LTE sniper in LK's biography his son Raghi

25:44.200 --> 25:51.000
states when he was assassinated it was of course not a complete surprise part of

25:51.000 --> 25:59.120
me had been expecting it for years his daughter Ajita concludes perhaps fate

25:59.120 --> 26:04.560
intervened on the night of August 12th but chance he allowed it to in the

26:04.560 --> 26:11.240
knowledge that his every move was being watched in the final analysis it is

26:11.240 --> 26:17.800
possible that Lakshman Kaduragama shows to meet his death that night as a sniper

26:17.800 --> 26:22.720
sat there trigger ready target in sight

26:28.320 --> 26:33.320
Lakshman Kaduragama's life was a quintessential hero's journey in a way

26:33.320 --> 26:39.560
he plays an archetypal role in my mind a true patriot that lived a life of

26:39.560 --> 26:45.600
nobility who wrote in a friend's autograph book at the age of 14 how

26:45.600 --> 26:52.760
sweet and honorable is it to die for one's country and still his biography

26:52.760 --> 26:58.680
doesn't depict a life of bliss and pleasure without any pain instead a

26:58.680 --> 27:05.080
life of angst grief strife and the tremendous weight of carrying the

27:05.080 --> 27:10.840
burden of a bloody and ruthless ethnic conflict according to David Bennett's

27:10.840 --> 27:18.280
hypothesis LK's life would be a bad one due to due to its inherent pain but most

27:18.280 --> 27:23.440
people would agree that he'll be good life it'll be philosophically laborious or

27:23.440 --> 27:28.880
probably impossible to reason and delineate this good but the purpose

27:28.880 --> 27:34.200
Lakshman Kaduragama lived for transcended all of his pain for the more

27:34.200 --> 27:41.560
his noble being created more overall good for the world stories like LK's

27:41.560 --> 27:47.600
remind me that hypothetical philosophical models will never explain life and

27:47.600 --> 27:52.920
reality we cannot create arbitrary axioms of good and bad to justify a living

27:52.920 --> 27:57.840
it's impossible ever to know all the consequences of living both good and

27:57.840 --> 28:05.160
bad intended or unintended besides how dare I adjudicate if a potential future

28:05.160 --> 28:13.360
person was to be born after a 30 year old war that took over 100,000 lives what

28:13.360 --> 28:19.240
would it be Trilanka's fate if Lakshman Kaduragama never came into being an

28:19.240 --> 28:26.840
answerable yet deeply moving question it's this impenetrable enigma and

28:26.840 --> 28:33.040
sublime inexplicability of life that mandates are so lived as we'll never

28:33.040 --> 28:39.000
know if life's worth living until we have all together and entirely lived it as

28:39.000 --> 28:45.160
one of Soran Kedricar's journals say it is really true what philosophy tells us

28:45.160 --> 28:50.760
that life must be understood backwards but with this one forgets the second

28:50.760 --> 28:57.040
proposition that it must be lived forwards a proposition which the more it

28:57.040 --> 29:03.000
is subjected to careful thought the more it ends up concluding precisely that

29:03.000 --> 29:10.120
life at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood exactly

29:10.120 --> 29:15.800
exactly because there is no single moment where time stops completely in

29:15.840 --> 29:23.240
order for me to take the position to do this going backwards often shortened to

29:23.240 --> 29:29.360
life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards I'm a

29:29.360 --> 29:33.800
software engineer and a few weeks ago I was having dinner at a steakhouse with

29:33.800 --> 29:38.800
one of my collegial engineers we had a fascinating conversation that led us all

29:38.800 --> 29:44.680
the way from discussing Roger Penrose's hypothesis on consciousness to me asking

29:44.680 --> 29:50.760
him mate if I may ask what does love mean to you he

29:50.760 --> 29:57.440
unhesitantly replied love gives me a reason for eternity I thought deeply

29:57.440 --> 30:03.200
about this response only love has the metamorphosing ability to turn an

30:03.200 --> 30:08.160
engineer who typically works in the technical realm of logic and cold

30:08.160 --> 30:16.000
abstractions into a port and produce such beautiful statement my fortune to

30:16.000 --> 30:21.960
fall in love with Shannon the most remarkable woman who if my luck prevails

30:21.960 --> 30:27.320
I hope to marry someday has convinced me that love is the most irrational

30:27.320 --> 30:33.800
chaotic and incomprehensible force of being that captivates our life like no

30:33.800 --> 30:40.040
other many have tried but no port or philosopher could ever accurately

30:40.040 --> 30:46.960
portray what love means to a human being I think this may be why the phrase goes

30:46.960 --> 30:54.800
I fell in love not I willed my way into love none of us plan to fall in love it

30:54.800 --> 31:01.960
just happens love is unplanned yet timeless unbidden it's yet yearnful

31:01.960 --> 31:08.680
obtruse yet tangible so real yet meaningful and ultimately we find a

31:08.680 --> 31:14.720
reason to live because of love alone this is why I think even Fitzwilliam

31:14.720 --> 31:20.360
Darcy had to go again societal standards and his own prejudice judgment as love

31:20.360 --> 31:24.880
drove him to profess his feelings towards Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and

31:24.880 --> 31:31.680
Prejudice in vain have I struggled it will not do my feelings will not be

31:31.680 --> 31:38.920
repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you

31:38.920 --> 31:44.280
however even if love alone gives a reason to live this life still worth

31:44.280 --> 31:50.360
living to the fullest even if the emotions evoked in us by love are good

31:50.360 --> 31:56.480
and absolutely real does love justify doing anything that benefits oneself

31:56.760 --> 32:02.080
like following one's passion marriage or having children firstly unless someone

32:02.080 --> 32:06.800
can prove otherwise doing things that are beneficial and good for ourselves

32:06.800 --> 32:12.160
isn't inherently selfish immoral or unjustifiable due to Eastern

32:12.160 --> 32:17.880
philosophies influence with ideas like impermanence or non-self accentuated by

32:17.880 --> 32:24.640
rampant materialism secularism and growing radical self-criticism within

32:24.640 --> 32:32.040
Western culture Westerners have begun to feel guilty for their own being with the

32:32.040 --> 32:36.200
loss of religion and consequently spirituality being jettisoned from the

32:36.200 --> 32:41.960
cultural ethos Westerners feel their individual lives are a waste of space

32:41.960 --> 32:48.760
on this planet or maybe even a pest brutally exploiting Gaia benevolent

32:48.760 --> 32:53.840
mother nature dr. Carl you in all his brilliance and wisdom understood the

32:53.840 --> 33:00.040
death of spirituality in 1957 and prophetically warned us of the ominous

33:00.040 --> 33:08.280
signs in his essay the undiscovered self just as man as a social being cannot in

33:08.280 --> 33:14.120
the long run exist without a tie to the community so the individual will never

33:14.120 --> 33:19.400
find the real justification for his existence and his own spiritual and

33:19.400 --> 33:26.800
moral autonomy anywhere except in an extra mundane principle capable of

33:26.800 --> 33:33.600
relativizing the overpowering influence of external factors the individual who

33:33.600 --> 33:38.760
is not anchored in God can offer no resistance on his own resources to the

33:38.760 --> 33:46.040
physical and moral blandishments of the world for this he needs the evidence of

33:46.080 --> 33:51.000
inner transcendent experience which alone can protect him from the otherwise

33:51.000 --> 33:58.400
inevitable submersion in the mass therefore with such negation of the

33:58.400 --> 34:05.640
individual self any act not serving the greater good but one self is looked

34:05.640 --> 34:11.360
down upon by contemporary culture but we must ignore scornful societal

34:11.360 --> 34:16.400
condescension and judgment as such nihilistic pessimism is futile and

34:16.400 --> 34:21.880
serves no purpose but only breeds resentment suppose something we find

34:21.880 --> 34:27.160
meaningful is good for us and this minimal harm nothing is entirely innocuous

34:27.160 --> 34:34.440
to society in that case there's no good reason to not do that thing undertaking

34:34.440 --> 34:39.280
such responsibility may even be a divine duty notwithstanding our

34:39.320 --> 34:46.640
consciousness of our own shortcomings and unworthiness secondly a bizarre

34:46.640 --> 34:52.280
realization we eventually come to have about life is that doing things not for

34:52.280 --> 34:57.640
ostensible virtue but genuine goodness that gives us a real sense of meaning

34:57.640 --> 35:03.880
mutual mutually benefits both society and ourselves getting married to a person

35:03.880 --> 35:08.480
we love begins a family one of society's most foundational and imperative

35:08.480 --> 35:13.840
units for it to function even if it were for entirely selfish reasons we

35:13.840 --> 35:20.280
decide to have a child let's say as a remedy for trisinarian odum this act

35:20.280 --> 35:26.960
results in bringing forth a new life and every human being is the epicenter of

35:26.960 --> 35:32.480
untapped potential and creation embarking on an entrepreneurial artistic or

35:32.480 --> 35:38.000
sporting venture merely to live out one's passion creates unforeseeable

35:38.000 --> 35:43.240
value in society and hopefully if done portfully even benefits the planet

35:43.240 --> 35:49.920
symbiotically not just in the cliche capitalist tenor of transactional value

35:49.920 --> 35:53.920
creation but even through those heavenly aspects of life that cannot be

35:53.920 --> 36:00.760
commoditized i.e. inspiration beauty elegance awe and wonder all of this

36:00.760 --> 36:05.160
goodness comes into being despite the inherent suffering and malevolence

36:05.160 --> 36:11.960
inexorably present in life however if we cannot see the divine ethos in this

36:11.960 --> 36:17.760
paradoxical miracle of being alive then nothing could stand up to our nihilistic

36:17.760 --> 36:24.520
and cruel judgment but what if we peel the onion one more layer why be good

36:24.520 --> 36:30.320
why not wreck havoc in society and burn it all to the ground it certainly

36:30.480 --> 36:34.920
creates circular reasoning to assert what must be good for the sake of

36:34.920 --> 36:41.040
goodness fortunately for reasons I can't fathom Abrahamic religions have a

36:41.040 --> 36:45.680
straightforward answer to this dilemma and I'm yet to find a better

36:45.680 --> 36:51.440
explanation or a more truthful narrative than this ancient story as it's an

36:51.440 --> 36:56.960
ultimate divine calling from God beginning with the Old Testament we are

36:56.960 --> 37:04.000
told so God created mankind in his own image and the image of God he created

37:04.000 --> 37:12.680
them male and female he created them Genesis 127 straddling to the cumulative

37:12.680 --> 37:18.560
commandment by Jesus of Nazareth in the Gospels thou shall love thy neighbor as

37:18.560 --> 37:25.120
thyself as many philosophers like Sartor and Dostoevsky understood there's no

37:25.120 --> 37:31.840
God all is permitted the central stipulation of this viewpoint is

37:31.840 --> 37:37.200
without a tangible moral absolute God specifically the monotheistic God

37:37.200 --> 37:43.960
humanity is left in a moral miasma of ethical oblivion and a volatile values

37:43.960 --> 37:49.480
framework it would be like trying to do theoretical physics without mathematics

37:49.840 --> 37:56.960
William Lane Craig recents accordingly in his apologetics book on God to say

37:56.960 --> 38:01.440
that the Holocaust was objectively raw is to say that the Holocaust was raw

38:01.440 --> 38:08.320
even though the Nazis who carried it out thought that it was right and and it

38:08.320 --> 38:13.520
would still have been wrong even if the Nazis had won World War two and succeeded

38:13.520 --> 38:18.880
in brainwashing or exterminating everybody who disagreed with them so that

38:18.920 --> 38:24.480
everyone in the world thought that the Holocaust was right and good to say that

38:24.480 --> 38:28.880
the Holocaust was objectively raw means that it's wrong regardless of the

38:28.880 --> 38:34.440
outcomes of World War two the premise is that if there's no God then moral

38:34.440 --> 38:40.320
values or duties are not objective in that sense and yet my unreasonable and

38:40.320 --> 38:45.280
rebellious heart is still unfulfilled I don't think human divinity can be

38:45.280 --> 38:50.720
reduced to a sentence, catchphrase, proposition, philosophical stipulation,

38:50.720 --> 38:55.720
commandment or law. Tenets could be extrapolated from our understanding of

38:55.720 --> 39:02.320
divinity for pragmatic or applicative sake i.e. Ten Commandments, Magna Carta,

39:02.320 --> 39:08.520
Universal Declaration of Human Rights but instances of divinity don't encompass

39:08.520 --> 39:15.040
all of its truth they only allude to its actuality our limited cognition knowledge

39:15.280 --> 39:21.560
and language gategoal and human divinity the moment it's instantiated for

39:21.560 --> 39:27.760
comprehension the ultimate catch-22 a celestial provocation that's making our

39:27.760 --> 39:33.880
predicament rather comical it's this absurdity of living that makes life both

39:33.880 --> 39:40.320
a tragedy and comedy I see this quandary unfold in my life every day from the

39:40.320 --> 39:44.600
moment I wake up in the morning sometimes I'm an atheistic relativist and

39:44.880 --> 39:51.120
other times I'm a spiritual being piously carrying out my divine duty it's

39:51.120 --> 39:55.040
not that I don't see the logical contradiction in this way of living I

39:55.040 --> 39:59.960
perfectly understand my folly but it's the most accurate way I can portray my

39:59.960 --> 40:06.720
dilemma and I know I'm not the only one maybe human beings created philosophy to

40:06.720 --> 40:11.960
deal with this spontaneous morality driven mainly by emotions that emerge in

40:11.960 --> 40:17.920
life we need coherent providence for cosmic forlorness from a cold and

40:17.920 --> 40:23.120
indifferent universe nevertheless our salvation does not lie in a simple

40:23.120 --> 40:30.400
postulation i.e. I'm a Christian Muslim or Jew I'm a Buddhist or Hindu I'm an

40:30.400 --> 40:37.080
atheist or skeptic etc we are too mercurial to be herald by mere label

40:37.880 --> 40:43.120
I'll observe myself being bizarre by ruining a perfectly good week by doing

40:43.120 --> 40:49.480
something that I hate which makes me miserable and self-loathing the label

40:49.480 --> 40:53.760
I used to define my identity is unavailing and meaningless during these

40:53.760 --> 41:02.680
times so I ask knowing exactly what or what not to do why does my it define my

41:02.720 --> 41:08.680
conscience do otherwise it is naive to think we base our lives on a philosophical

41:08.680 --> 41:15.040
proposition or some arbitrary religious or non-religious label ask yourself how

41:15.040 --> 41:19.840
often do you do things you hate contemporary psychology may call this

41:19.840 --> 41:25.600
self-destructive behavior but identifying its reality doesn't answer the

41:25.600 --> 41:31.120
fundamental question why do human beings act out in this peculiar and

41:31.120 --> 41:37.240
nonsensical way when we observe our lives in retrospect it seems clear that

41:37.240 --> 41:42.800
rationality explains very little about our condition I'm yet to find a

41:42.800 --> 41:47.680
quintessential rationalist even in my highly technical field of computer

41:47.680 --> 41:54.120
science where people mainly deal with logical abstractions people remain true

41:54.120 --> 42:00.040
to their nature I think this is why it's poignant to see modern society reduce

42:00.160 --> 42:05.800
the human experience to pragmatic utilitarianism and carelessly disregard

42:05.800 --> 42:10.760
any sense of the sublime therefore given that life resembles more a symphony or

42:10.760 --> 42:16.040
story over an a priori culturalistic mechanism how do we deal with this

42:16.040 --> 42:21.280
existential volatility at least for now I've concluded what's ultimately left

42:21.280 --> 42:27.400
for us to do is to take a Kierkegaardian leap of faith according to the Sanford

42:27.400 --> 42:31.920
Encyclopedia of Philosophy for Kierkegaard Christian faith is not a

42:31.920 --> 42:37.800
matter of regurgitating church dogma it is a matter of individual subjective

42:37.800 --> 42:44.480
passion which cannot be mediated by the clergy or by human artifacts faith is the

42:44.480 --> 42:49.520
most important task to be achieved by a human being because only on the basis of

42:49.520 --> 42:55.400
faith does an individual have a chance to become a true self this self is a

42:55.480 --> 43:03.040
lifework which God judges for eternity it has taken me years to understand what

43:03.040 --> 43:08.840
faith meant to human beings reading Kierkegaard at least shed some light on

43:08.840 --> 43:14.920
the matter he uses Abraham from the book of Genesis and the modifical night of

43:14.920 --> 43:21.360
faith in his book fear and trembling to expound how he viewed faith people are

43:21.360 --> 43:25.480
unable to bear the martyrdom unintelligently jump off the pile and

43:25.480 --> 43:31.720
choose instead conveniently enough the world's admiration of their proficiency

43:31.720 --> 43:38.240
the true night of faith is a witness never a teacher and in this lies the

43:38.240 --> 43:43.560
deep humanity in him which is more word than this foolish concern for others

43:43.560 --> 43:49.200
wheel and wall which is honored under the name of sympathy but which is

43:49.200 --> 43:55.240
really nothing but vanity the true night of faith is always absolute

43:55.240 --> 44:02.440
isolation the false night is sectarian this sectarianism is an attempt to leap

44:02.440 --> 44:08.240
away from the narrow path of the paradox and become a tragic hero at a cheap

44:08.240 --> 44:15.440
price the tragic hero expresses universal and sacrifices himself for it the

44:15.440 --> 44:21.600
sectarian punch in yellow instead of that has a private theater i.e. several

44:21.600 --> 44:26.800
good friends and comrades who represent the universal just about as well as the

44:26.800 --> 44:32.440
Beatles in the golden snuff box represents justice the individual of faith on

44:32.440 --> 44:37.440
the contrary is the paradox is the individual absolutely nothing but the

44:37.440 --> 44:42.280
individual without connections or pretensions this is the terrible thing

44:42.280 --> 44:47.120
which a sectarian mannequin can't endure for instead of learning from this

44:47.120 --> 44:51.560
terror that he's not capable of performing the great deed and then

44:51.560 --> 44:58.080
plainly admitting it an act which I cannot but approve because it is what I

44:58.080 --> 45:03.960
do the mannequin thinks that by uniting with several other mannequins he will be

45:03.960 --> 45:08.920
able to do it but that is quite out of the question in the world of spirit no

45:08.920 --> 45:15.480
swindling is tolerated the narrow passage to gold is a lonely journey it has to be

45:15.480 --> 45:21.360
or else our faith is mine you can only have faith in our individual pilgrimage

45:21.360 --> 45:26.520
and gold when I first came across as philosophy I became depressed I only

45:26.520 --> 45:31.240
used to term dramatically as an extra word that likes community and enjoys a

45:31.240 --> 45:37.000
good conversation preferably over a fine steak and some whiskey I remember

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
thinking why does arguably the most important journey of our life the one

45:42.000 --> 45:48.760
to God have to be a lonely endeavor but then I understood living in faith is a

45:48.760 --> 45:54.600
state of being be embodied regardless of our public proclamations it is the only

45:54.600 --> 45:59.560
real identity we incarnate that's unconditionally of our own will because

45:59.560 --> 46:05.600
every other identity gender race sexuality class etc is

46:05.600 --> 46:12.160
inescapably feted by society culture biology and the objective world there's

46:12.160 --> 46:17.720
only a subjective spiritual journey that transcends every other material identity

46:17.720 --> 46:24.080
given to us by simply being alive therefore refusing to accept our

46:24.080 --> 46:29.080
divide divine adventures loneliness and trying to find it through social

46:29.080 --> 46:34.480
institutions or the predominant cultural zeitgeist of our times with only

46:34.520 --> 46:40.480
corrupt its essence and exacerbate our understandable nihilistic cynicism however

46:40.480 --> 46:46.160
we must not misunderstand this journey to be a despondent one around the end of

46:46.160 --> 46:52.840
2017 I experienced a somewhat miracle in life despite all my inadequate season

46:52.840 --> 46:59.600
flaws I made a conscious choice to embody faith I started not to see the

46:59.640 --> 47:06.320
transcendent as a distant deistic reality but rather to see divinity in

47:06.320 --> 47:11.560
mundane life or the Christian parlance treat everyone as God's children and

47:11.560 --> 47:18.800
everything as God's creation I learned that living on faith took courage most

47:18.800 --> 47:23.680
people think it takes courage to face death it doesn't that is inevitable

47:24.120 --> 47:30.120
what requires true courage is the will to live I still face the same trials and

47:30.120 --> 47:35.760
tribulations of life I did in 2017 albeit I found love in 2018 and that's

47:35.760 --> 47:43.280
redemptive to one soul but my choice my lonely leap of faith miraculously rid me

47:43.280 --> 47:49.320
of nihilistic cynicism notwithstanding the malevolence and suffering in being

47:49.400 --> 47:57.320
recognized every day I doubt I can argue against anti-natalism David

47:57.320 --> 48:02.080
Bennett has the verbal virtuosity and it an intellectual prowess that I don't

48:02.080 --> 48:09.320
even remotely possess and yet I know the best case I can make against

48:09.320 --> 48:15.080
anti-natalism is by how I live the faith I choose to embody is the antidote to

48:15.080 --> 48:20.240
cynicism it's at least the best I can do

48:21.440 --> 48:27.840
cynicism is the worst form of existence it doesn't help anybody nor is it a

48:27.840 --> 48:32.640
remedy to anything it's neither pragmatic nor does it answer the deepest

48:32.640 --> 48:38.000
grievances in the human heart a cynic doesn't want to live nor die but only

48:38.000 --> 48:44.560
being a state of resentful non-existence a supercilious refusal to partake in

48:44.560 --> 48:51.600
life being cynical is just cowardly a piece of animus an unheroic reaction to

48:51.600 --> 48:58.480
life yes a lot can and probably will go wrong our passions could be fruitless

48:58.480 --> 49:03.360
and lame every venture we start could end up in failure and possible and

49:03.360 --> 49:06.480
possible ruin friends will disappoint us

49:06.480 --> 49:12.120
unapologetically marriage could end in a better divorce our children might hate

49:12.160 --> 49:18.920
us for a pathetic ineptness as parents love could break our heart we will

49:18.920 --> 49:24.520
witness unjust suffering and we may even be partly responsible for us for its

49:24.520 --> 49:31.520
subsistence during these lamentable moments helpless helplessness will

49:31.520 --> 49:36.880
haunt our souls culture will turn eyes us and society will negate our

49:36.920 --> 49:43.360
individuality nature will try to wipe us out of existence and there will be times

49:43.360 --> 49:49.520
where we feel abandoned and alienated from a cold and dark universe apathetic

49:49.520 --> 49:57.400
and indifferent to our feelings but somehow in spite of everything I said

49:57.400 --> 50:03.280
it about living by faith vindicates all the ghastly anxiety-evoking horrors of

50:03.280 --> 50:08.960
being I can only extrapolate from my journey in the last few years as that's

50:08.960 --> 50:16.200
the only worthy story I can tell I found that faith allows the objective and

50:16.200 --> 50:21.320
subjective to touch by revealing a phenomenological coherence to the

50:21.320 --> 50:26.800
faithful it shows symphony in life and the drama that unfolds as we paradoxically

50:26.840 --> 50:34.480
take part in it as both an audience and cast member faith shows how every

50:34.480 --> 50:40.720
instance of being is meaningful both subjective and objectively faith is the

50:40.720 --> 50:45.720
handmade enough love so we're left with no recalls but to embody faith

50:45.720 --> 50:51.240
undergirded by relentless courage in every moment of life we should not think

50:51.240 --> 50:56.520
of it as a another distant and anachronistic religious ritual being

50:56.520 --> 51:02.280
faithful is an act of bravery for what it's worth I can sincerely say that I

51:02.280 --> 51:06.840
try to consciously exercise faith in every aspect of my life career

51:06.840 --> 51:11.680
relationships family how I treat strangers and even software engineering

51:11.680 --> 51:17.880
I've learned its paramount nature has to be the reason religion is primarily

51:17.920 --> 51:22.920
revealed to us through faith as it amalgamates reality like no other

51:22.920 --> 51:28.160
I've humbled myself to this truth it's what Kerkakar understood about the

51:28.160 --> 51:36.040
crucifixion of Jesus as he writes in the sickness unto death the opposite of sin

51:36.040 --> 51:40.560
is not virtue but faith
