00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
It probably isn't anyone right now who's doing a better job than Lex Friedman at showing the

00:05.360 --> 00:10.720
beauty of science and scientific discourse. Because of Lex, ordinary people like me have the

00:10.720 --> 00:16.080
opportunity to listen to the most brilliant months in the world as if we are just nonchalantly chatting

00:16.080 --> 00:21.360
over a beer. And I'm sure there's an innumerable number of people who have turned on to programming,

00:21.360 --> 00:26.960
AI and science in general, because of the Lex Friedman podcast. With his starry-eyed curiosity,

00:26.960 --> 00:33.360
Lex, resembling Dostoevsky's idiot, not only makes science accessible for new fights like myself,

00:34.000 --> 00:40.080
but also shows his viewers the absolute necessity and pertinence of science in our own lives.

00:40.080 --> 00:45.280
So of course, he's right in venerating the scientific enterprise, but science too has its

00:45.280 --> 00:51.120
shortcomings, like every man-made philosophical enterprise. And that's why I think Lex Friedman

00:51.120 --> 00:56.400
is wrong in believing science will save us. Now, when I do make a video where I'm disagreeing with

00:56.400 --> 01:03.440
one of my heroes, a person who's had an unbelievable influence in my life that I can't just even put

01:03.440 --> 01:10.000
in words, I probably need to make this caveat or have this caveat where I try to convey what the

01:10.000 --> 01:16.640
purpose and intent behind this video is. This isn't a gotcha or a Ben Shapiro debunk slash destroy

01:16.640 --> 01:24.480
this kind of video. Like those early 2010, edgy atheist anti-SJW stuff that used to be on YouTube,

01:25.200 --> 01:31.600
not because I'm above them or I'm saying that, you know, I find them below me. I actually found

01:31.600 --> 01:37.520
them quite entertaining, but they were just that. All I found them were pretty much entertainment,

01:38.080 --> 01:44.000
but I don't think any of those really edgy kind of videos changed my mind. So I don't want this

01:44.000 --> 01:47.840
video to be that, because I just find them unproductive. Rather, I want to try and delineate

01:47.840 --> 01:53.200
and expound on what I think are philosophical differences between Lex and myself in the hopes

01:53.200 --> 01:58.320
of finding some kind of synthesis to its trip. My disagreement is that when Lex considers our

01:58.320 --> 02:04.160
reality and the human experience, he makes generalizing statements about science like this.

02:04.160 --> 02:10.240
I wonder if there's something that could have been done better to give people hope

02:11.360 --> 02:14.800
that science will save us as opposed to science will divide us.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.320
Or when he says science wins through love and humility. For example, this was from Lex Freeman

02:20.320 --> 02:26.320
podcast 238 with Francis Collins, where they discussed the pervasive pandemic on our reaction to

02:26.320 --> 02:34.080
it. In the battle of ideas, I think humility and love wins. And that's how science wins,

02:34.080 --> 02:38.640
not through having quote unquote truth. Now to be fair, though, when Lex uses the term

02:38.640 --> 02:44.960
science colloquially, I don't mean he means it in the academic or scholarly way, the word science

02:44.960 --> 02:51.120
would be used, which involves, you know, empiricism and the systematic categorization or organization

02:51.120 --> 02:55.920
of knowledge. Since he is a romantic like myself, I think he talks about the beauty of the scientific

02:55.920 --> 03:03.040
enterprise of what it is for a conscious entity like a human being to do science, which is in

03:03.040 --> 03:08.480
reality more different from what science means technically. Regardless of the semantics, I think

03:08.480 --> 03:14.720
because of science's almost miraculous rise to influence and it's become so

03:14.720 --> 03:21.680
ubiquitous and just a part of our day to day life as a society, we've unfortunately begun to

03:21.680 --> 03:28.480
replace the whole of the human experience with just science. And I think the problem with that is that

03:29.360 --> 03:36.160
in some sense, when we replace the whole by a singular, so the whole of the human experience

03:36.160 --> 03:41.840
by a singular aspect or a fragment of the human experience like the scientific enterprise,

03:42.560 --> 03:46.080
it begins to lack any balance, let's say.

03:50.960 --> 03:56.480
Because in the real world, as I kind of touched on, the scientific enterprise itself is nested

03:56.480 --> 04:02.560
within the broader human experience. And I think we make this mistake or we confuse these two things

04:02.560 --> 04:08.960
at our own peril as we evidently see in the unraveling times we live in. So if I could consider

04:08.960 --> 04:14.400
Lex's podcast itself, I'm glad he changed the name from artificial intelligence to the Lex

04:14.400 --> 04:20.640
Friedman podcast. Artificial intelligence is a multidisciplinary academic and scientific discipline.

04:20.640 --> 04:26.160
The Lex Friedman podcast is a phenomenon that an observer experiences in different things. And I'd

04:26.160 --> 04:31.840
even postulate that people are not necessarily attracted to AI, but rather to the Lex Friedman

04:31.840 --> 04:38.640
podcast where the discussion of AI, another sub experience, so to speak, is only a part of the

04:38.640 --> 04:44.560
broader podcast experience. My point being, there is something to our experience. Let's make it a bit

04:44.560 --> 04:51.040
more tangible and say the experience of learning that transcends mere scientific empiricism and

04:51.040 --> 04:56.000
materialism. So I've made all these claims, but I really haven't backed any of it up. And that's

04:56.000 --> 05:00.880
what I hope to do in the rest of the video. But before I do do that, I kind of want to try and

05:00.880 --> 05:06.880
once again succinctly lay down my points using a bit of brevity, something that I'm terrible at,

05:06.880 --> 05:14.560
because I'm quite verbose. Anyways, here's my point. My assertions are the scientific enterprise

05:14.560 --> 05:21.040
doesn't encompass all of the human experience. Rather, science is nested within something

05:21.040 --> 05:27.840
transcendental. Therefore, it's wrong to unequivocally assume that science will save us or be the

05:27.920 --> 05:34.480
ultimate panacea to our predicaments. Science is merely a tool to be exploited to use a somewhat

05:34.480 --> 05:40.640
dramatic term by our values, which lies in a different domain, possibly the religious.

05:40.640 --> 05:45.040
So to try and elucidate my points, I'll break down the rest of this video into two parts.

05:45.040 --> 05:51.120
Firstly, the fact value distinction. I'll discuss the axiomatic presuppositions we used to think

05:51.120 --> 05:56.960
and act in this world. I'll try and understand the qualitative distinction between values and how

05:57.040 --> 06:02.880
facts are always, bar none, filtered through our bellies, more specifically, moral bellies.

06:02.880 --> 06:07.760
And then I'll use Jonathan Pedro's ideas of the hierarchy of bellies to show how science is

06:07.760 --> 06:14.240
nested within religion. Secondly, I'll discuss the dangers of scientific utopianism, the totalitarian

06:14.240 --> 06:20.720
impulse of reason by coupling my concerns of scientism with the ideas from Jonathan Haidt's

06:20.720 --> 06:24.800
moral foundations theory. And then of course, we're looking to Alexa's favorite novelist,

06:24.800 --> 06:30.400
Fyodor Dostoevsky's critique of utopian thinking with his use of the crystal palace in his

06:30.400 --> 06:35.040
literature. You know, it's very common in the media where there's some political pundit or

06:35.040 --> 06:42.080
commentator that say with rather overweening confidence, follow the science, they declare

06:42.080 --> 06:47.520
that we ought to follow the science. But the problem is, none of us can truly follow the

06:47.520 --> 06:51.840
science the way they mean it. Because when someone makes a statement, they make this

06:51.920 --> 06:57.520
presupposition that we know where to begin with. They make the presupposition that we've got axioms

06:57.520 --> 07:03.200
to start this journey of following the science with. I mean, to put it plainly, when someone says

07:03.200 --> 07:08.960
follow something, that assumes there's a beginning point or a start and an end. Like for example,

07:08.960 --> 07:15.200
a topic that comes to my mind is something that's of course innocuous and not controversial at all,

07:15.200 --> 07:21.360
like COVID and vaccines. You know, from both sides in this whole debate, people say follow the

07:21.360 --> 07:26.400
science. And you know, there are some people who are pro vex, some people are anti vex, some people

07:26.400 --> 07:33.120
are pro lockdowns, anti lockdowns, or there are people like me who are, you know, lockdowns to a

07:33.120 --> 07:38.240
certain extent. And then afterwards open up society, people should get vaccinated and then,

07:38.240 --> 07:43.200
you know, move on with your lives, but don't cause or mandate the vaccines. Sorry, I had to

07:43.200 --> 07:49.200
say all of that just to clarify my stance. But the point being, you see, all these people in some

07:49.200 --> 07:55.760
sense, we are all given the same data. We're at least exposed to similar variables, let's say.

07:56.320 --> 08:01.600
However, the debate about COVID isn't scientific anymore. It's completely value space. It's

08:01.600 --> 08:08.480
completely on what that starting point is, what those axioms that we use to begin our journey of

08:08.480 --> 08:13.680
following the science's whip. It's nothing to do with what the epidemiology says. Instead,

08:13.680 --> 08:20.000
epidemiology or science in general is used as a tool to accentuate ethical contentions

08:20.000 --> 08:25.200
in this debate. At a minimum, we all used economics, politics, science, our personal

08:25.200 --> 08:32.480
intuitions, insight, et cetera, and did a sort of multivariate analysis consciously or subconsciously.

08:32.480 --> 08:38.080
The scientific facts itself never makes a decision for us because they simply can't do so.

08:38.160 --> 08:43.680
Rather, these facts were always filtered through a philosophical framework or more accurately,

08:43.680 --> 08:49.600
an indispensable narrative structure, the Seneca known that a person uses to interpret and filter

08:49.600 --> 08:54.160
through reality. Therefore, speaking somewhat figuratively, the moment human consciousness

08:54.160 --> 09:00.800
becomes part of the equation, a fact value and a is odd distinction is created. So a big part of

09:00.800 --> 09:06.160
the whole COVID debate, of course, was the idea of safety. We took all these measures so that we

09:06.160 --> 09:12.080
can be safe. But safety itself isn't a scientific value. It doesn't exist in the domain of science.

09:12.080 --> 09:17.680
Safety is actually deeply subjective. Some people are more risk averse, some people are more tolerant

09:17.680 --> 09:23.360
towards risks. And these things differ broadly in a massive society. People don't want the same

09:23.360 --> 09:29.680
thing. Some people value safety or freedom and people like me value freedom over safety. We just

09:29.680 --> 09:34.480
simply have to make trade-offs depending on our values. And all these different groups, let's say,

09:34.480 --> 09:40.800
hypothetically, even in a perfect world, were given the same exact scientific findings, the same

09:40.800 --> 09:46.000
exact scientific data. This is what they were exposed to. They would all come up with different

09:46.000 --> 09:51.200
conclusions. They'd all have different ending points because their axioms, their starting points,

09:51.200 --> 09:57.520
or let's call it their odds and odds, or nots are different. And these ethics that herald our

09:57.520 --> 10:04.560
actions, so to speak, they come from a much deeper set of moral values, something that is beyond

10:04.560 --> 10:08.560
science, something that's beyond rationality, that's something that's, I'd even argue,

10:08.560 --> 10:15.040
transcendent. It goes to the domain of religious and the domain of mythology and narrative. And in

10:15.040 --> 10:20.240
the domain of values, in the domain of the religious, the verification method or positivism or whatever

10:20.240 --> 10:25.440
you call it, that has worked so well in the scientific domain, in the scientific enterprise,

10:25.440 --> 10:28.560
isn't simply going to work. It's where reason and rationality,

10:28.560 --> 10:32.640
culturally speaking, runs out. And I'm going to say something which

10:32.640 --> 10:38.560
some people are quite averse to. It goes to the domain of the mystical, the transcendentally

10:38.560 --> 10:43.200
ineffable. And all these things that we've taken for granted for the longest time,

10:43.840 --> 10:51.680
and to use a union term, I think these values, these deeply held moral values, or these deeply

10:51.760 --> 10:58.000
held stories that, let's say, imbue our moral values to use a union term are embedded in our

10:58.000 --> 11:02.320
collective unconscious. And of course, needless to state, none of these ideas come from me.

11:02.320 --> 11:07.040
Philosophers, religious thinkers have been trying to debate, understand and seek out answers to

11:07.040 --> 11:12.160
these questions since time immemorial. Reading a bit of philosophy, it's actually a beautiful

11:12.160 --> 11:16.960
experience knowing that people have always pondered and thought about these questions.

11:17.680 --> 11:23.040
And it's always been a part of the wisdom tradition, and it's always been something

11:23.040 --> 11:27.520
everyone's spoken about a lot, even though I think now it's spoken about less.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.520
Then again, a recent acclaimed conversation that took place a couple of years ago,

11:31.520 --> 11:37.360
the debate between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris on truth and morality,

11:37.360 --> 11:42.080
is a good example on how pertinent these ideas are to our life.

11:42.080 --> 11:46.400
And even though I hate to reduce such rich conversations to a bunch of propositions,

11:46.400 --> 11:50.800
I have to do so for the sake of brevity. The gist of the debate was Harris believes

11:50.800 --> 11:56.080
values and moral principles can be derived or inferred from facts. Much like he doesn't

11:56.080 --> 12:01.840
as book the moral landscape, he challenges Hume's yes or problem, and asserts and ought

12:01.840 --> 12:06.240
what to do can be derived from a what is on the grounds of increasing well-being.

12:06.240 --> 12:10.560
Peterson, of course, disagrees. However, unlike most of Sam's debate is, he doesn't

12:10.560 --> 12:16.880
merely place a somewhat arbitrary goal as an unforeseeable propositional axiom. Rather,

12:16.880 --> 12:22.400
he sees religious narrative and story which involves God as being an ontic point for us

12:22.400 --> 12:27.120
to live and act in this world. As a union, he tries to demonstrate how archetypes act

12:27.120 --> 12:31.840
as intermediary structures to arrange the facts in such a way to imbue values.

12:31.840 --> 12:35.520
According to him, stories aren't true in the sense of a scientific fact,

12:35.520 --> 12:40.080
that they are meditates by marshalling our actions on what to do with the fact.

12:40.080 --> 12:44.960
So Harris' claims of increasing well-being is essentially a narrativized,

12:44.960 --> 12:50.480
necessary axiomatic presupposition that prevents an infinite regress, which is not a fact.

12:51.200 --> 12:56.640
I don't know if I have a stance on this matter. I don't think anyone really truly

12:56.640 --> 13:00.960
has a stance on this matter, and if anyone does, either they're lying or they're just being

13:00.960 --> 13:04.560
unbelievably hubristic. But I would say that I happen to

13:04.560 --> 13:10.480
stand or agree a lot more with Peterson than Sam Harris. The more I've pulled about and I'd even

13:10.480 --> 13:16.720
say struggled with these questions, I think I've come to the realization that one cannot infer

13:16.720 --> 13:23.600
values from facts or values from truth, we'll say, without being self-referential and presuppositional.

13:23.600 --> 13:28.480
My best intuition of this, I'd say, actually comes from someone I've been reading recently,

13:29.440 --> 13:36.960
Mr. Nietzsche, his idea, his philosophy of perspectivism, where we can't divorce

13:37.840 --> 13:43.120
observation or understanding of the world from our perspective. We don't just observe the world

13:44.480 --> 13:49.840
plainly without any perspective or without, we are a conscious being where the world is

13:49.840 --> 13:54.640
observed and filtered through us. So in this filtering process, we do have a values framework.

13:54.720 --> 13:59.600
We have certain narratives and beliefs that we hold, and knowingly or unknowingly,

13:59.600 --> 14:03.600
the world is interpreted through this. Interestingly, speaking about Nietzsche,

14:03.600 --> 14:08.160
he also makes a point in Döngeren Evel, and I think a couple of his other books that,

14:08.160 --> 14:15.280
you know, Christianity by its this ardent and sort of, you know, vigorous drive, let's say,

14:15.280 --> 14:20.240
towards truth, because in Christianity, truth is the highest ideal, Christ himself is the embodiment

14:20.240 --> 14:25.920
of truth that Christianity ended up destroying itself by giving rise to science. I don't think

14:25.920 --> 14:31.600
I know what to make of that statement. I don't know what that tells us about contemporary society.

14:31.600 --> 14:37.760
However, that does lead me to probably one of the most radical and incomprehensible points

14:38.320 --> 14:43.280
for us modern people that made by Jonathan Pedro, a Christian near-playtoness,

14:43.920 --> 14:50.880
where he explicated how science is nested within religion, not in some inadvertent,

14:50.880 --> 14:55.520
pragmatic or inspirational sense where religion inspired people to do science,

14:55.520 --> 15:02.960
but rather that without religion itself, literally, science cannot exist. Apart from the enigmatic

15:02.960 --> 15:08.960
kind, Jonathan Pedro's work has had the biggest influence in changing my view on science. He helped

15:09.040 --> 15:14.640
me realize that science has a problem. Science cannot define or categorize itself, and as a result,

15:14.640 --> 15:19.840
it has to make arbitrary, mercurial accidents. And this always goes wrong as we see from the

15:19.840 --> 15:24.560
politicization of science these days. One of Jonathan's contemporaries and another intellectual hero

15:24.560 --> 15:30.400
of mine, John Revekey, explains this paradoxical dilemma of science best in Jordan Peterson's

15:30.800 --> 15:38.080
science. The science exists. Okay, if it is, what kind of entity is it? And tell me using

15:38.080 --> 15:45.280
physics or chemistry or even biology, use just though that ontology and those methodology,

15:45.280 --> 15:51.280
tell me what science is, and tell me how it has the status to make the claims it does,

15:51.280 --> 15:56.480
and tell me how science is related to meaning and truth, and how do meaning and truth fit

15:56.480 --> 16:01.840
into the scientific worldview? They're presupposed by that worldview, but they have no proper place

16:01.840 --> 16:07.680
within it. That's what I mean. So whenever we're doing the science and saying, this is what the

16:07.680 --> 16:16.720
world is, we are absenting ourselves from it. We have no home in which we are properly situated.

16:16.720 --> 16:23.440
And I think that ramifies through everything we think, say, and do to each other and with each

16:23.440 --> 16:27.680
other in a profoundly corrosive way. That's what I mean by the meaning. It's to this problem,

16:27.680 --> 16:33.200
Jonathan Pagel replies with his explanation of the hierarchy of values using symbolism and

16:33.200 --> 16:38.880
religious language of the neo-Pedonist kind. He postulates that as science itself is a product

16:38.880 --> 16:45.280
of consciousness, it cannot exist without a higher old encompassing framework, which ultimately is

16:45.280 --> 16:50.480
what religious language attempts to portray. In this video using the example of a mountain,

16:50.480 --> 16:56.400
Jonathan points out that such language is a type of meta language or meta process

16:56.400 --> 17:01.440
that contains science within it. And in some sense, gives it meaning. So in relation to modern

17:01.440 --> 17:07.440
science, religious language would be something like something of a meta process or a meta language,

17:07.440 --> 17:16.160
because it tries to express the thing it is focusing on, let's say a mountain, while also

17:16.160 --> 17:22.880
expressing the process by which that focus is even possible. So if modern science can describe

17:22.880 --> 17:31.840
a mountain height with terrain, its foliage, its mineral constitution, religious language is expressing

17:32.640 --> 17:39.520
why I have a category like mountain in the first place, why that category is relevant to humans,

17:39.520 --> 17:46.480
basically what does a mountain mean? So the scientists will retort something like this,

17:46.480 --> 17:54.640
will retort something like a mountain doesn't mean anything. But to say so is to ignore the human

17:54.640 --> 18:02.240
variable, ignore that we are the ones looking at the mountain, even if I believe that that mountain

18:02.240 --> 18:10.560
is outside of my tiny existence. It ignores consciousness, ignores why I would bother to

18:10.560 --> 18:17.120
have a category like mountain. It ignores that I have to climb a mountain or go around a mountain

18:17.120 --> 18:24.080
when it's in my way. It ignores the effect going up a mountain has on human consciousness.

18:25.920 --> 18:30.720
All those things are real. There are no more illusions than the scientific data.

18:31.360 --> 18:37.600
Symbolism tries to take all of that into account, that is discuss a mountain without pretending that

18:37.600 --> 18:45.600
we are not human beings living in a world of mountains. So it does have a personal and social

18:45.600 --> 18:52.080
aspect to it because it takes into account consciousness, but it isn't just personal and

18:52.080 --> 18:59.520
social. And also taking consciousness into account doesn't mean that it's a relative thing and

18:59.520 --> 19:05.680
subjective in the way that we see that word today, subjective in the sense of idiosyncratic,

19:05.680 --> 19:13.760
arbitrary, to my own particularities and preclivities. There's a universal aspect to the experience of

19:13.760 --> 19:24.720
a mountain. So the religious language is above the scientific language and contains the scientific

19:24.720 --> 19:30.400
process within it, makes it possible. You know, a lot of caveats have been added in this video,

19:30.400 --> 19:35.680
I think, but I do want to add another one. I want to make this after I listen to a debate

19:35.680 --> 19:40.800
between Jonathan Pedro and rationally roots. The reality of what Jonathan's talking about,

19:40.800 --> 19:46.480
to understand that, or even to understand the fact value distinction, it truly does require

19:46.480 --> 19:53.120
a rather radical paradigm shift in one's thinking. But also, I think more importantly,

19:53.200 --> 19:57.280
we really have to start paying attention to our conscious experience. It's funny,

19:57.280 --> 20:03.840
a lot of these skeptics or rationalists always say, follow the evidence. I go where the evidence

20:03.840 --> 20:10.960
leads me. And I can't believe how much people can lack in self-awareness to believe that

20:10.960 --> 20:16.320
they're so open-minded. I don't think any of us are as open-minded, or let's say we are like a

20:16.320 --> 20:22.000
sponge that just absorbs evidence and just changes our worldviews based on the evidence the way we

20:22.000 --> 20:26.400
think we'd like to be. It's really difficult to change our mind. So at least I'd say, I'm going

20:26.400 --> 20:31.920
to be honest, I find it quite hard to change my mind. I don't think I could just follow the evidence

20:31.920 --> 20:36.400
and just go where it leads. I don't think that's how my mind works. And I think apart from the

20:36.400 --> 20:41.280
problem of the fact value distinction, that kind of metaphysical philosophical debate that I spoke

20:41.280 --> 20:47.440
about before, I think, you know, reality is human psychology, which simply just don't change our

20:47.440 --> 20:52.480
minds like that. And since I used to word psychology, maybe now is a good time to move to a section of

20:52.480 --> 20:56.880
this video that's a bit more tolerable. You know, I've been talking about these obstruous philosophies

20:56.880 --> 21:02.480
for a while, metaphysics and all that, which can be rather hard to grasp. And you know, let's be

21:02.480 --> 21:09.600
honest, you know, in some sense, we are all confined in our way of thinking. We are all confined to,

21:09.600 --> 21:15.600
in many ways, we all think the way the Enlightenment philosophers, when I mean we, I mean, we,

21:15.680 --> 21:21.920
modern society, we all think the way Enlightenment philosophers told us the thing, that that's how

21:21.920 --> 21:27.360
we were told to perceive and understand the world. And as Wittgenstein so brilliantly put it, once

21:27.360 --> 21:33.280
you climb up that Wittgensteinian ladder of just philosophy and propositions or rationality, let's

21:33.280 --> 21:39.520
say, one must transcend it, one must throw it away and move beyond it. So I'm not going to be

21:39.520 --> 21:43.680
transcending that ladder or going to a different philosophy, rather I'll be coming to something

21:43.680 --> 21:48.800
a bit more grounded, a topic that I think we can understand a bit more, which is psychology.

21:48.800 --> 21:54.480
And that leads me to a point, which I've been trying to understand and probably explicate

21:54.480 --> 22:00.320
in some way. It is that utopian thinking, scientific utopianism, any kind of utopian

22:00.320 --> 22:06.880
thinking is, psychologically speaking, essentially totalitarian. And understanding why the psychology

22:06.880 --> 22:12.880
of utopianism is totalitarian isn't some philosophical game, at least in the analytical

22:12.880 --> 22:21.200
sense. It's rather deeply experiential. It's having this unbelievable amount of self-awareness where

22:21.920 --> 22:29.520
when one has a thought, where one has an idea or some kind of ideal one striving towards,

22:29.520 --> 22:35.920
I think it's really important to be deeply introspective. And I'd even say try and observe

22:35.920 --> 22:42.560
oneself without any moral judgment from a third person perspective. See what emotions rise,

22:42.560 --> 22:51.120
see what makes me or whoever. Why am I thinking this way? Am I being totalitarian? Am I being

22:51.120 --> 22:56.240
absolutist in my quote unquote remedies to the world's problems or my own problems?

22:56.880 --> 23:03.680
And I think then we all come to the realization that utopianism is always totalitarian in nature.

23:03.680 --> 23:08.000
Because knowing oneself is knowing how one comes to their conclusion. It's good or bad.

23:08.480 --> 23:15.360
And what we're capable of doing once we have those conclusions. And to be honest, sometimes

23:15.360 --> 23:21.600
that's a deeply terrifying realization. As psychoanalysts have told us, human beings have an innate

23:21.600 --> 23:27.680
nature to us. However, this doesn't necessarily mean we're all the same. We differ in our interests,

23:27.680 --> 23:33.440
temperaments, proclivities, idiosyncrasies, and certainly physiologically. A manifest example

23:33.440 --> 23:37.920
of these differences is shown in the moral foundations theory, popularized in Jonathan

23:37.920 --> 23:42.960
Hyde's book, The Righteous Mind. The basic idea of the theory is that our moral intuitions come

23:42.960 --> 23:49.200
from certain foundations and concerns, some of these even mutually opposed, that we nonetheless value

23:49.200 --> 23:54.320
in informing the moral basis for our beliefs. It could be because of these fundamental differences,

23:54.320 --> 23:59.040
we find it difficult to see eye to eye on social, religious, and political matters.

23:59.040 --> 24:03.520
And so far, I don't think any of these findings are controversial or worrisome. I don't think we

24:03.520 --> 24:08.640
need a thorough knowledge of social psychology to understand that we all differ, even though it

24:08.640 --> 24:13.840
might help us empathize more with people of different views to our own, if we know how and why

24:13.840 --> 24:19.200
they develop these worldviews. But what deeply perturbs me is the claim Jonathan Hyde makes in

24:19.200 --> 24:25.520
his book of social intuitionism, where we form our views through intuition rather than rationality.

24:25.520 --> 24:32.160
And furthermore, we actually use rational port to justify our initial belief. Using the elephant

24:32.160 --> 24:37.040
and the rider metaphor, he says we don't come to our beliefs through rationality as some of the

24:37.040 --> 24:41.040
enlightenment thinkers would like to proclaim. The oldest ideas in intellectual history is the

24:41.040 --> 24:46.240
idea that the mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. And wherever you look east

24:46.240 --> 24:50.240
or west, there's sort of an idea that there's some sort of higher, more reasoning area and then some

24:50.320 --> 24:59.520
sort of lower, more animal-like faculty. Plato gives us many metaphors in the Timaeus. He says

24:59.520 --> 25:04.800
that the gods created mankind. They put reason in those orbs, and orbs had a role on the ground,

25:04.800 --> 25:09.120
so they had to create the bodies. So that's one metaphor. The other is the phaedrus,

25:09.120 --> 25:14.320
reason is the charioteer, and the passions, the noble passions, the base passions, are the horses.

25:14.320 --> 25:18.880
And if a man studies philosophy and learns to control those passions, then he can escape the

25:18.880 --> 25:25.680
bondage of reincarnation and return to the gods. Now, I think this view, the idea that reason,

25:26.480 --> 25:31.200
of course, Plato didn't say that reason is the master in most people, but he said it can be.

25:31.760 --> 25:37.040
It is in philosophers, and everyone should strive for it, so he believed it was possible.

25:37.040 --> 25:41.040
I think this view of reason has taken quite a beating since the 1990s, certainly from the

25:41.040 --> 25:46.000
neuroscientists, who found that when you lose your emotionaries, you don't get hyper-rational.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.200
In fact, you either become unable to really think, because reasoning actually depends critically on

25:51.200 --> 25:56.160
emotion and intuition, or if you're still able to think at all, you become more like a psychopath

25:56.160 --> 26:01.920
who simply doesn't have any emotions in forming his reasoning. So I think the reason as master

26:01.920 --> 26:06.320
view has taken quite a beating, and I'll give it more of a beating, model two, the idea that

26:06.320 --> 26:12.240
reason is a servant. This is, as you know, the model that I endorse, that reason is a great

26:12.240 --> 26:17.840
helper, but it simply is not qualified to lead. But rather than speaking of reason as a slave,

26:17.840 --> 26:23.920
which is Hume's word, or a servant, I think if we think about it as a really intelligent servant,

26:23.920 --> 26:27.760
really more like a press secretary. This is Robert Gibbs, Obama's first press secretary,

26:28.480 --> 26:34.160
and he's a very, very smart guy. They're partners. They work together, but you will never change

26:34.160 --> 26:37.920
Obama's mind by convincing his press secretary that something is wrong. That's just not the way

26:37.920 --> 26:43.680
the system's designed. So it just structurally can't happen that way. Now, Hume said that the

26:43.680 --> 26:48.880
passions were the master. Jesse Prince embraces emotion straight out. He says we can do all

26:48.880 --> 26:52.240
this work with emotion. I used to think that in the 90s. I don't think that anymore. I think we

26:52.240 --> 26:56.800
really need to talk about intuition more broadly. A lot of the things I've studied have been moral

26:56.800 --> 27:01.040
emotions, but as you'll see, there are many cases of gut feelings that aren't exactly emotions.

27:02.160 --> 27:06.080
Now, you might say, well, okay, maybe reason's not the master, but it could certainly be an

27:06.080 --> 27:10.240
equal partner. And this is the view that Josh Green has and that Darshan Arvayas has. Green

27:10.240 --> 27:17.440
gives us the idea of Kant and Mill fighting it out in the brain. Darshan Arvayas uses the

27:17.440 --> 27:21.920
metaphor of dancing. Now, it seems to me that if you have dancing, you have one person leading,

27:21.920 --> 27:26.080
the other following, but she says, well, it's a different kind of dancing where they take turns.

27:26.080 --> 27:33.840
Okay. But even if you downgrade it from master to equal partner, is the evidence that we have on

27:33.840 --> 27:38.880
reasoning, is that consistent with reason, even playing an equal partner role? Is reasoning good

27:38.880 --> 27:45.440
enough, independent enough to play the role of equal partner? I don't think so. So the science

27:45.440 --> 27:53.520
that we hold in such high regard, much like reason is merely a tool to be used by our emotions and

27:53.520 --> 27:57.680
intuitions. We may like to think in a sort of blank slate kind of way where these

27:58.240 --> 28:04.240
emotionless, intuitionless automatons that simply follow the facts. And once we

28:04.240 --> 28:08.400
have all the facts, we come to our conclusions, but we are not. And on a bit of a side note,

28:08.400 --> 28:14.560
I personally like the fact that we simply aren't these automatons. I like the fact that

28:14.560 --> 28:19.840
we have emotions. We are deeply feeling creatures. We aren't just merely governed by

28:19.840 --> 28:25.760
reason alone. Now, I don't have time to get into it, but I would leave a link down below to a great,

28:25.760 --> 28:32.960
great essay or story, a sort of allegorical story by Raymond Smully and called A Planet Without

28:32.960 --> 28:38.880
Laughter, where he describes the paradox of what it would be like living in a reality

28:40.000 --> 28:44.560
where we are only governed by reason. Anyways, I digress. Getting back to the video,

28:44.560 --> 28:50.800
the problem now is whatever conclusion that we've come to, we believe that we came to this viewpoint

28:50.800 --> 28:57.360
using reason and mere facts alone. And we think that regardless of the consequences,

28:57.360 --> 29:03.440
whatever the outcome of our conclusion is, we must push through just by the consequences,

29:03.440 --> 29:08.720
because we think the conclusion we have, the viewpoint we hold now, this is absolute truth,

29:08.720 --> 29:14.480
because I came to this conclusion based purely on facts. Therefore, I must hold the truth,

29:14.480 --> 29:19.840
and it just makes sense to go ahead and let that truth, let's say, actualize in the world.

29:19.840 --> 29:25.360
It's in this kind of self-referential, self-fulfilling way of thinking what I mean by

29:25.360 --> 29:32.240
totalitarian. It's to bring forth the utopia we will do whatever it takes, because we are 100%

29:32.240 --> 29:38.000
absolutely accurate in our conclusions. And in modern times, this torturizing mentality manifests

29:38.000 --> 29:43.200
in many ways, but I think the most salient way is in the name of science and reason. It's very

29:43.200 --> 29:49.520
common for us to see a Ben Shapiro destroy someone with facts and logic, because he's got the facts,

29:49.520 --> 29:54.240
he's got the logic, he's got all the answers. Therefore, he's absolutely right. Ben Shapiro

29:54.240 --> 29:58.800
is a right-wing conservative guy, and it's a complete lie that the right wing is anti-science,

29:58.800 --> 30:04.000
or the left wing is anti-science, or vice versa, or whatever. None of these sides are anti-science

30:04.000 --> 30:10.800
or anti-recent. They're both pro-science and pro-recent, but the problem is they both think

30:10.800 --> 30:16.640
that they come to their truth merely by using science and reason alone. But no, both these sides

30:16.640 --> 30:23.120
don't come to their conclusions from just facts. They come to their conclusions to keep it a bit

30:23.120 --> 30:29.520
more grounded, let's say, at least based on their moral foundations. So science, again, just becomes

30:29.520 --> 30:34.640
a means to an end, that end which is created through their moral foundations. And these moral

30:34.640 --> 30:40.240
foundations, left-wing, right-wing, conservative, liberal, whatever, doesn't matter. These foundations

30:40.240 --> 30:46.480
aren't derived using a scientific method, because they aren't scientific truths and I'd even say

30:46.480 --> 30:51.120
science isn't the only way to get at truth. And my fear, of course, is because our society is so

30:51.120 --> 30:58.640
deeply, for all it's good, influenced by enlightenment thinking, and both sides, right or left, whatever

30:58.640 --> 31:06.240
are influenced by science and reason, there's that aspect of totalitarianism that comes in,

31:06.880 --> 31:12.480
and we move towards the dangers of scientific utopianism. You believe in the Crystal Palace,

31:12.560 --> 31:17.520
eternally indestructible. That is, one at which you can never stick out your tongue

31:17.520 --> 31:23.360
furtively, nor make a rude gesture, even with your fist head in a way. Well, perhaps I'm so afraid

31:23.360 --> 31:28.400
of this building precisely because it's made of crystal and it's eternally indestructible,

31:28.400 --> 31:32.880
and because it won't be possible to stick out one's tongue even furtively. So what's this Crystal

31:32.880 --> 31:37.360
Palace Dostoevsky writes about? It's actually based on a real monument from the 19th century,

31:37.360 --> 31:43.200
and I think it's deeply, in a very profound way, pertinent, in a symbolic sense, I'd say,

31:43.200 --> 31:48.320
to the society we live in. It was this vast exhibition hall built of glass and iron in London

31:48.320 --> 31:54.800
to house this great exhibition of 1851. And for the time, it was very technologically advanced,

31:54.800 --> 32:00.080
and anyways, the specificities of it doesn't matter. What matters is, as I said, what it symbolizes.

32:00.080 --> 32:05.600
In Russian literature, along with the Industrial Revolution, it symbolizes progress and this

32:05.600 --> 32:10.480
move towards the utopian society. There were authors like Shona Shevsky who used it to represent

32:10.480 --> 32:16.480
these utopian socialist communes that the people of the future would live in. And of course,

32:16.480 --> 32:22.880
Dostoevsky rebukes his claims and says that, no, human beings don't desire utopia,

32:22.880 --> 32:26.800
even if there was a utopia, we would end up destroying it because that's not what our heart

32:26.800 --> 32:30.160
really wants. You know, my reading of Notes from Underground, which probably is the book

32:30.160 --> 32:34.720
that I've read the most in my life, is that I think what Dostoevsky is trying to say is that

32:35.680 --> 32:41.440
the human soul, the human beings are obviously very, very incomprehensible beings,

32:42.240 --> 32:49.120
and we are all walking paradoxes, you know. In our souls, yes, we want to be safe,

32:49.120 --> 32:54.320
we want to be happy and live a good life with well-being and all of that, but at the same time,

32:54.880 --> 33:03.040
we also want to be free, in some sense, existentially free, and we would desire being free

33:03.840 --> 33:09.920
than over-living in so-called paradises of the utopia. If we do live in a so-called utopian

33:09.920 --> 33:16.560
paradise, if we didn't have this freedom of conscience, freedom in our soul to do as we

33:16.560 --> 33:23.120
will in that paradise, we would still not prefer that. We'd still rather suffer and be free than

33:24.000 --> 33:27.840
not be free and not have any suffering. So before I go on and on about Dostoevsky,

33:27.840 --> 33:32.880
which I could do forever because I absolutely love his work, a good question to ask is,

33:33.760 --> 33:38.400
why does any of this, the Crystal Palace, all of it, why does it matter to our times?

33:38.960 --> 33:43.760
I think it's quite straightforward. It's because what the Crystal Palace represents

33:43.760 --> 33:51.360
is the modern AI project, and I think Lex, as much as I love him, very much falls to this car,

33:51.360 --> 33:59.280
I guess, trap or this way of thinking about AI the same way maybe thinkers of that time

33:59.280 --> 34:04.400
poured about the Crystal Palace. We look to technology to be our savior, we look to AI or

34:04.400 --> 34:12.480
whatever it is to be humanity's redeemer, savior, and to be the means that gets us the utopia.

34:12.480 --> 34:18.320
Such utopian thinking isn't necessarily a modern phenomenon, nor is it merely a product of scientific

34:18.320 --> 34:24.160
advancement. For example, we see forms of it in the Tower of Babel, a very ancient story from the

34:24.160 --> 34:29.760
Bible. My point being, it's not the object or theory we project this desire onto that matters,

34:29.760 --> 34:34.880
but the psychic phenomena of that desire itself. It doesn't matter if it's the Tower of Babel,

34:34.880 --> 34:40.080
Crystal Palace, AI, or Steven Pinker's Enlightenment Rationalism. What we should be

34:40.080 --> 34:46.160
attentive towards is the totalizing impulse we have to attribute a certain thing, scientific or not,

34:46.160 --> 34:51.440
to be the panacea to all our problems. Furthermore, since utopianism inevitably becomes

34:51.440 --> 34:56.960
totalitarian, it is all-encompassing and doesn't leave any room for fragments of being that are

34:56.960 --> 35:02.240
outside a given utopian ideology. It's a similar idea that Jordan Peterson and Jonathan Peugeot

35:02.240 --> 35:07.600
discussed in a recent podcast about the key difference between heaven and utopia.

35:07.600 --> 35:12.720
Heaven is generally conceptualized. You can conceptualize it as a state of being. It might

35:12.720 --> 35:18.160
be the state of being that those people that you described live in have had paradisal experiences

35:18.720 --> 35:24.400
where everything transformed itself into something that was perfect, that appeared perfect,

35:24.400 --> 35:33.760
and I was unable to stay in those frames of mind. The heaven, is that something we build?

35:33.760 --> 35:40.000
Is that something? I don't understand the relationship between the heaven that awaits us,

35:40.000 --> 35:45.920
let's say, after we die. That's the idea and what we build here on earth. Do those touches?

35:46.720 --> 35:49.920
Is that the doctrine? There's so much of this doctrine I don't understand.

35:51.920 --> 35:59.200
At all. I think a way to see it has to do with attention again, and it has to do with a hierarchy

35:59.200 --> 36:07.200
of attention. If you try to build heaven, you're going to fail. You're going to fail miserably

36:07.200 --> 36:14.240
because you're not aiming high enough. You're aiming and then you get stuck in this

36:14.240 --> 36:19.360
in these weird world of opposites that you don't even understand the side effects of what you're

36:19.360 --> 36:25.680
doing. For one person, heaven will look like if everything could be perfectly ordered then,

36:25.680 --> 36:29.680
right, and then we know what that looks like. Another person will look at heaven and think,

36:29.680 --> 36:34.640
if everything could be free, we could all just be free and then that we know what that looks like.

36:35.840 --> 36:41.520
The idea is to look higher. There's a story that I've been had.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.680
We have to strive for something better, but then we end up in, which is what you're saying,

36:45.680 --> 36:49.440
is that we end up with the Tower of Babel or we end up with the flood or we end up with

36:51.680 --> 36:55.920
the catastrophe, continual catastrophe of unintended consequences. But

36:55.920 --> 37:02.800
as you yourself said, we are aiming for something better. The question is, how do you pursue Utopia

37:02.800 --> 37:08.480
while avoiding the pitfalls? That's a theological question. Yeah, it is. I think it,

37:08.480 --> 37:14.720
I know people are going to hate that I say this, but it has to do with worship. It has to do with

37:14.720 --> 37:21.440
what you worship. So if you worship those things that you're aiming towards, the lower things,

37:21.440 --> 37:27.200
if you worship the making a safer society, if you worship the making a freer society,

37:27.200 --> 37:32.240
if you worship making a stronger society, all of these things are going to go off the rails

37:32.240 --> 37:39.600
because they have unintended consequences that you don't understand because they're a fragment

37:39.600 --> 37:44.400
of reality. They need to be encompassed together in order to reach something higher.

37:45.840 --> 37:49.600
That's the danger of ideology. It's the part that takes the place of the whole.

37:52.080 --> 37:58.240
The idea is that if you worship God, then those other things will

37:59.200 --> 38:03.920
will kind of lay themselves out slowly and you won't be able to force them. They'll kind of lay

38:03.920 --> 38:08.960
themselves out slowly and they'll start to manifest, you know, progressively and as you,

38:08.960 --> 38:14.320
but you have to attend to the highest. With scientific utopianism, one value is divinized

38:14.320 --> 38:20.560
and science becomes the means to bring forth the ends. The safety, freedom, order, or even

38:20.560 --> 38:26.480
technological progress with no regard to any other value, or even the ramifications of said value.

38:26.480 --> 38:30.880
And since science itself is only a tool that's malleable and has no way of justifying the

38:30.880 --> 38:37.280
means it uses, that one value that all utopians pursue become the only thing that matters.

38:37.280 --> 38:42.560
There's no balance, no nuance, no context as utopianism lacks and hierarchy of values.

38:43.200 --> 38:47.760
After all, utopia was derived from the Greek meaning nowhere and there probably is a good

38:47.760 --> 38:52.800
reason for that. Regardless of our philosophical or religious beliefs, I think a laudable goal for

38:52.800 --> 39:00.240
all of us, I'd even say the motivating spirit of the scientific enterprise should be to bring heaven

39:00.240 --> 39:04.240
on earth. I truly believe a lot of people, especially those like Lex, who just have a

39:04.240 --> 39:10.080
big heart and just truly loves life and humanity and everything that comes along

39:10.080 --> 39:16.480
with the baggage of being, let's say. I believe the goal of most scientists and a lot of people

39:16.480 --> 39:22.800
is this, it's to make life on earth better. It's the motivating spirit, it's to in some sense,

39:22.800 --> 39:28.960
yes, to bring heaven on earth. And this is in no way an anti-science or even worse, an anti-scientist

39:28.960 --> 39:34.640
video. I really hope I didn't convey that I was being cynical in that sense because absolutely

39:34.640 --> 39:39.360
not. I mean, I work in committee science, I'm a software engineer and my field wouldn't exist if

39:39.360 --> 39:45.600
not for this world of science that I review and love so much. I could never forgive myself for such

39:46.240 --> 39:53.920
lazy, casual cynicism. Rather, the intent or the purpose of this video was to try and contextualize

39:53.920 --> 40:01.280
science. It was to try and understand in the hierarchical topology of epistemology where the

40:01.280 --> 40:07.040
science stands. A lot of big words I know, but plainly in a broader culture, what's the role

40:07.040 --> 40:13.120
science plays? Because I think by understanding this, we not only make the scientific enterprise,

40:13.120 --> 40:19.440
we not only make that a much more fruitful endeavor, but we also make the human experience

40:19.440 --> 40:24.800
much more richer and substantial. And Lex, of course, is a good example of what happens when

40:24.800 --> 40:32.720
the scientist and the poet meets. So saying all that, please do consider sharing this video with

40:32.720 --> 40:36.720
Lex. That would be a dream come true. Thanks for watching.
