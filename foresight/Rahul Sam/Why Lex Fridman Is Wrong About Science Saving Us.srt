1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
It probably isn't anyone right now who's doing a better job than Lex Friedman at showing the

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,720
beauty of science and scientific discourse. Because of Lex, ordinary people like me have the

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,080
opportunity to listen to the most brilliant months in the world as if we are just nonchalantly chatting

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,360
over a beer. And I'm sure there's an innumerable number of people who have turned on to programming,

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,960
AI and science in general, because of the Lex Friedman podcast. With his starry-eyed curiosity,

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,360
Lex, resembling Dostoevsky's idiot, not only makes science accessible for new fights like myself,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,080
but also shows his viewers the absolute necessity and pertinence of science in our own lives.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,280
So of course, he's right in venerating the scientific enterprise, but science too has its

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,120
shortcomings, like every man-made philosophical enterprise. And that's why I think Lex Friedman

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,400
is wrong in believing science will save us. Now, when I do make a video where I'm disagreeing with

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:03,440
one of my heroes, a person who's had an unbelievable influence in my life that I can't just even put

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,000
in words, I probably need to make this caveat or have this caveat where I try to convey what the

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,640
purpose and intent behind this video is. This isn't a gotcha or a Ben Shapiro debunk slash destroy

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,480
this kind of video. Like those early 2010, edgy atheist anti-SJW stuff that used to be on YouTube,

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,600
not because I'm above them or I'm saying that, you know, I find them below me. I actually found

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,520
them quite entertaining, but they were just that. All I found them were pretty much entertainment,

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,000
but I don't think any of those really edgy kind of videos changed my mind. So I don't want this

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,840
video to be that, because I just find them unproductive. Rather, I want to try and delineate

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,200
and expound on what I think are philosophical differences between Lex and myself in the hopes

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,320
of finding some kind of synthesis to its trip. My disagreement is that when Lex considers our

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,160
reality and the human experience, he makes generalizing statements about science like this.

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,240
I wonder if there's something that could have been done better to give people hope

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,800
that science will save us as opposed to science will divide us.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,320
Or when he says science wins through love and humility. For example, this was from Lex Freeman

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,320
podcast 238 with Francis Collins, where they discussed the pervasive pandemic on our reaction to

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:34,080
it. In the battle of ideas, I think humility and love wins. And that's how science wins,

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,640
not through having quote unquote truth. Now to be fair, though, when Lex uses the term

28
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,960
science colloquially, I don't mean he means it in the academic or scholarly way, the word science

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,120
would be used, which involves, you know, empiricism and the systematic categorization or organization

30
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,920
of knowledge. Since he is a romantic like myself, I think he talks about the beauty of the scientific

31
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,040
enterprise of what it is for a conscious entity like a human being to do science, which is in

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,480
reality more different from what science means technically. Regardless of the semantics, I think

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,720
because of science's almost miraculous rise to influence and it's become so

34
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,680
ubiquitous and just a part of our day to day life as a society, we've unfortunately begun to

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,480
replace the whole of the human experience with just science. And I think the problem with that is that

36
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,160
in some sense, when we replace the whole by a singular, so the whole of the human experience

37
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,840
by a singular aspect or a fragment of the human experience like the scientific enterprise,

38
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,080
it begins to lack any balance, let's say.

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,480
Because in the real world, as I kind of touched on, the scientific enterprise itself is nested

40
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,560
within the broader human experience. And I think we make this mistake or we confuse these two things

41
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,960
at our own peril as we evidently see in the unraveling times we live in. So if I could consider

42
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,400
Lex's podcast itself, I'm glad he changed the name from artificial intelligence to the Lex

43
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,640
Friedman podcast. Artificial intelligence is a multidisciplinary academic and scientific discipline.

44
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,160
The Lex Friedman podcast is a phenomenon that an observer experiences in different things. And I'd

45
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,840
even postulate that people are not necessarily attracted to AI, but rather to the Lex Friedman

46
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,640
podcast where the discussion of AI, another sub experience, so to speak, is only a part of the

47
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,560
broader podcast experience. My point being, there is something to our experience. Let's make it a bit

48
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,040
more tangible and say the experience of learning that transcends mere scientific empiricism and

49
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,000
materialism. So I've made all these claims, but I really haven't backed any of it up. And that's

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,880
what I hope to do in the rest of the video. But before I do do that, I kind of want to try and

51
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,880
once again succinctly lay down my points using a bit of brevity, something that I'm terrible at,

52
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,560
because I'm quite verbose. Anyways, here's my point. My assertions are the scientific enterprise

53
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,040
doesn't encompass all of the human experience. Rather, science is nested within something

54
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,840
transcendental. Therefore, it's wrong to unequivocally assume that science will save us or be the

55
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:34,480
ultimate panacea to our predicaments. Science is merely a tool to be exploited to use a somewhat

56
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,640
dramatic term by our values, which lies in a different domain, possibly the religious.

57
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,040
So to try and elucidate my points, I'll break down the rest of this video into two parts.

58
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,120
Firstly, the fact value distinction. I'll discuss the axiomatic presuppositions we used to think

59
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,960
and act in this world. I'll try and understand the qualitative distinction between values and how

60
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,880
facts are always, bar none, filtered through our bellies, more specifically, moral bellies.

61
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,760
And then I'll use Jonathan Pedro's ideas of the hierarchy of bellies to show how science is

62
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,240
nested within religion. Secondly, I'll discuss the dangers of scientific utopianism, the totalitarian

63
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,720
impulse of reason by coupling my concerns of scientism with the ideas from Jonathan Haidt's

64
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,800
moral foundations theory. And then of course, we're looking to Alexa's favorite novelist,

65
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,400
Fyodor Dostoevsky's critique of utopian thinking with his use of the crystal palace in his

66
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,040
literature. You know, it's very common in the media where there's some political pundit or

67
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:42,080
commentator that say with rather overweening confidence, follow the science, they declare

68
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,520
that we ought to follow the science. But the problem is, none of us can truly follow the

69
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,840
science the way they mean it. Because when someone makes a statement, they make this

70
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,520
presupposition that we know where to begin with. They make the presupposition that we've got axioms

71
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,200
to start this journey of following the science with. I mean, to put it plainly, when someone says

72
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,960
follow something, that assumes there's a beginning point or a start and an end. Like for example,

73
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,200
a topic that comes to my mind is something that's of course innocuous and not controversial at all,

74
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,360
like COVID and vaccines. You know, from both sides in this whole debate, people say follow the

75
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,400
science. And you know, there are some people who are pro vex, some people are anti vex, some people

76
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,120
are pro lockdowns, anti lockdowns, or there are people like me who are, you know, lockdowns to a

77
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,240
certain extent. And then afterwards open up society, people should get vaccinated and then,

78
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,200
you know, move on with your lives, but don't cause or mandate the vaccines. Sorry, I had to

79
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,200
say all of that just to clarify my stance. But the point being, you see, all these people in some

80
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,760
sense, we are all given the same data. We're at least exposed to similar variables, let's say.

81
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,600
However, the debate about COVID isn't scientific anymore. It's completely value space. It's

82
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,480
completely on what that starting point is, what those axioms that we use to begin our journey of

83
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,680
following the science's whip. It's nothing to do with what the epidemiology says. Instead,

84
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,000
epidemiology or science in general is used as a tool to accentuate ethical contentions

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,200
in this debate. At a minimum, we all used economics, politics, science, our personal

86
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:32,480
intuitions, insight, et cetera, and did a sort of multivariate analysis consciously or subconsciously.

87
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,080
The scientific facts itself never makes a decision for us because they simply can't do so.

88
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,680
Rather, these facts were always filtered through a philosophical framework or more accurately,

89
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,600
an indispensable narrative structure, the Seneca known that a person uses to interpret and filter

90
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,160
through reality. Therefore, speaking somewhat figuratively, the moment human consciousness

91
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,800
becomes part of the equation, a fact value and a is odd distinction is created. So a big part of

92
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,160
the whole COVID debate, of course, was the idea of safety. We took all these measures so that we

93
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,080
can be safe. But safety itself isn't a scientific value. It doesn't exist in the domain of science.

94
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,680
Safety is actually deeply subjective. Some people are more risk averse, some people are more tolerant

95
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,360
towards risks. And these things differ broadly in a massive society. People don't want the same

96
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,680
thing. Some people value safety or freedom and people like me value freedom over safety. We just

97
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,480
simply have to make trade-offs depending on our values. And all these different groups, let's say,

98
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,800
hypothetically, even in a perfect world, were given the same exact scientific findings, the same

99
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,000
exact scientific data. This is what they were exposed to. They would all come up with different

100
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,200
conclusions. They'd all have different ending points because their axioms, their starting points,

101
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,520
or let's call it their odds and odds, or nots are different. And these ethics that herald our

102
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:04,560
actions, so to speak, they come from a much deeper set of moral values, something that is beyond

103
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,560
science, something that's beyond rationality, that's something that's, I'd even argue,

104
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,040
transcendent. It goes to the domain of religious and the domain of mythology and narrative. And in

105
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,240
the domain of values, in the domain of the religious, the verification method or positivism or whatever

106
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,440
you call it, that has worked so well in the scientific domain, in the scientific enterprise,

107
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,560
isn't simply going to work. It's where reason and rationality,

108
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,640
culturally speaking, runs out. And I'm going to say something which

109
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,560
some people are quite averse to. It goes to the domain of the mystical, the transcendentally

110
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,200
ineffable. And all these things that we've taken for granted for the longest time,

111
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:51,680
and to use a union term, I think these values, these deeply held moral values, or these deeply

112
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,000
held stories that, let's say, imbue our moral values to use a union term are embedded in our

113
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,320
collective unconscious. And of course, needless to state, none of these ideas come from me.

114
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,040
Philosophers, religious thinkers have been trying to debate, understand and seek out answers to

115
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,160
these questions since time immemorial. Reading a bit of philosophy, it's actually a beautiful

116
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,960
experience knowing that people have always pondered and thought about these questions.

117
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,040
And it's always been a part of the wisdom tradition, and it's always been something

118
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,520
everyone's spoken about a lot, even though I think now it's spoken about less.

119
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Then again, a recent acclaimed conversation that took place a couple of years ago,

120
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,360
the debate between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris on truth and morality,

121
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,080
is a good example on how pertinent these ideas are to our life.

122
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,400
And even though I hate to reduce such rich conversations to a bunch of propositions,

123
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,800
I have to do so for the sake of brevity. The gist of the debate was Harris believes

124
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,080
values and moral principles can be derived or inferred from facts. Much like he doesn't

125
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,840
as book the moral landscape, he challenges Hume's yes or problem, and asserts and ought

126
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,240
what to do can be derived from a what is on the grounds of increasing well-being.

127
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,560
Peterson, of course, disagrees. However, unlike most of Sam's debate is, he doesn't

128
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,880
merely place a somewhat arbitrary goal as an unforeseeable propositional axiom. Rather,

129
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,400
he sees religious narrative and story which involves God as being an ontic point for us

130
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,120
to live and act in this world. As a union, he tries to demonstrate how archetypes act

131
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,840
as intermediary structures to arrange the facts in such a way to imbue values.

132
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,520
According to him, stories aren't true in the sense of a scientific fact,

133
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,080
that they are meditates by marshalling our actions on what to do with the fact.

134
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,960
So Harris' claims of increasing well-being is essentially a narrativized,

135
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,480
necessary axiomatic presupposition that prevents an infinite regress, which is not a fact.

136
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,640
I don't know if I have a stance on this matter. I don't think anyone really truly

137
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,960
has a stance on this matter, and if anyone does, either they're lying or they're just being

138
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,560
unbelievably hubristic. But I would say that I happen to

139
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,480
stand or agree a lot more with Peterson than Sam Harris. The more I've pulled about and I'd even

140
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,720
say struggled with these questions, I think I've come to the realization that one cannot infer

141
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,600
values from facts or values from truth, we'll say, without being self-referential and presuppositional.

142
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,480
My best intuition of this, I'd say, actually comes from someone I've been reading recently,

143
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,960
Mr. Nietzsche, his idea, his philosophy of perspectivism, where we can't divorce

144
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,120
observation or understanding of the world from our perspective. We don't just observe the world

145
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,840
plainly without any perspective or without, we are a conscious being where the world is

146
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,640
observed and filtered through us. So in this filtering process, we do have a values framework.

147
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,600
We have certain narratives and beliefs that we hold, and knowingly or unknowingly,

148
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,600
the world is interpreted through this. Interestingly, speaking about Nietzsche,

149
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,160
he also makes a point in Döngeren Evel, and I think a couple of his other books that,

150
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:15,280
you know, Christianity by its this ardent and sort of, you know, vigorous drive, let's say,

151
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,240
towards truth, because in Christianity, truth is the highest ideal, Christ himself is the embodiment

152
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,920
of truth that Christianity ended up destroying itself by giving rise to science. I don't think

153
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,600
I know what to make of that statement. I don't know what that tells us about contemporary society.

154
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,760
However, that does lead me to probably one of the most radical and incomprehensible points

155
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,280
for us modern people that made by Jonathan Pedro, a Christian near-playtoness,

156
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,880
where he explicated how science is nested within religion, not in some inadvertent,

157
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,520
pragmatic or inspirational sense where religion inspired people to do science,

158
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:02,960
but rather that without religion itself, literally, science cannot exist. Apart from the enigmatic

159
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,960
kind, Jonathan Pedro's work has had the biggest influence in changing my view on science. He helped

160
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,640
me realize that science has a problem. Science cannot define or categorize itself, and as a result,

161
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,840
it has to make arbitrary, mercurial accidents. And this always goes wrong as we see from the

162
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,560
politicization of science these days. One of Jonathan's contemporaries and another intellectual hero

163
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,400
of mine, John Revekey, explains this paradoxical dilemma of science best in Jordan Peterson's

164
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:38,080
science. The science exists. Okay, if it is, what kind of entity is it? And tell me using

165
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:45,280
physics or chemistry or even biology, use just though that ontology and those methodology,

166
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:51,280
tell me what science is, and tell me how it has the status to make the claims it does,

167
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,480
and tell me how science is related to meaning and truth, and how do meaning and truth fit

168
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,840
into the scientific worldview? They're presupposed by that worldview, but they have no proper place

169
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,680
within it. That's what I mean. So whenever we're doing the science and saying, this is what the

170
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:16,720
world is, we are absenting ourselves from it. We have no home in which we are properly situated.

171
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,440
And I think that ramifies through everything we think, say, and do to each other and with each

172
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,680
other in a profoundly corrosive way. That's what I mean by the meaning. It's to this problem,

173
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,200
Jonathan Pagel replies with his explanation of the hierarchy of values using symbolism and

174
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,880
religious language of the neo-Pedonist kind. He postulates that as science itself is a product

175
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,280
of consciousness, it cannot exist without a higher old encompassing framework, which ultimately is

176
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,480
what religious language attempts to portray. In this video using the example of a mountain,

177
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,400
Jonathan points out that such language is a type of meta language or meta process

178
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,440
that contains science within it. And in some sense, gives it meaning. So in relation to modern

179
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,440
science, religious language would be something like something of a meta process or a meta language,

180
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:16,160
because it tries to express the thing it is focusing on, let's say a mountain, while also

181
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,880
expressing the process by which that focus is even possible. So if modern science can describe

182
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:31,840
a mountain height with terrain, its foliage, its mineral constitution, religious language is expressing

183
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,520
why I have a category like mountain in the first place, why that category is relevant to humans,

184
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,480
basically what does a mountain mean? So the scientists will retort something like this,

185
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:54,640
will retort something like a mountain doesn't mean anything. But to say so is to ignore the human

186
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:02,240
variable, ignore that we are the ones looking at the mountain, even if I believe that that mountain

187
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:10,560
is outside of my tiny existence. It ignores consciousness, ignores why I would bother to

188
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:17,120
have a category like mountain. It ignores that I have to climb a mountain or go around a mountain

189
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:24,080
when it's in my way. It ignores the effect going up a mountain has on human consciousness.

190
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,720
All those things are real. There are no more illusions than the scientific data.

191
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,600
Symbolism tries to take all of that into account, that is discuss a mountain without pretending that

192
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:45,600
we are not human beings living in a world of mountains. So it does have a personal and social

193
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,080
aspect to it because it takes into account consciousness, but it isn't just personal and

194
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,520
social. And also taking consciousness into account doesn't mean that it's a relative thing and

195
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,680
subjective in the way that we see that word today, subjective in the sense of idiosyncratic,

196
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:13,760
arbitrary, to my own particularities and preclivities. There's a universal aspect to the experience of

197
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:24,720
a mountain. So the religious language is above the scientific language and contains the scientific

198
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,400
process within it, makes it possible. You know, a lot of caveats have been added in this video,

199
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,680
I think, but I do want to add another one. I want to make this after I listen to a debate

200
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,800
between Jonathan Pedro and rationally roots. The reality of what Jonathan's talking about,

201
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,480
to understand that, or even to understand the fact value distinction, it truly does require

202
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,120
a rather radical paradigm shift in one's thinking. But also, I think more importantly,

203
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,280
we really have to start paying attention to our conscious experience. It's funny,

204
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,840
a lot of these skeptics or rationalists always say, follow the evidence. I go where the evidence

205
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,960
leads me. And I can't believe how much people can lack in self-awareness to believe that

206
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,320
they're so open-minded. I don't think any of us are as open-minded, or let's say we are like a

207
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,000
sponge that just absorbs evidence and just changes our worldviews based on the evidence the way we

208
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,400
think we'd like to be. It's really difficult to change our mind. So at least I'd say, I'm going

209
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,920
to be honest, I find it quite hard to change my mind. I don't think I could just follow the evidence

210
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,400
and just go where it leads. I don't think that's how my mind works. And I think apart from the

211
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,280
problem of the fact value distinction, that kind of metaphysical philosophical debate that I spoke

212
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,440
about before, I think, you know, reality is human psychology, which simply just don't change our

213
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,480
minds like that. And since I used to word psychology, maybe now is a good time to move to a section of

214
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,880
this video that's a bit more tolerable. You know, I've been talking about these obstruous philosophies

215
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,480
for a while, metaphysics and all that, which can be rather hard to grasp. And you know, let's be

216
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,600
honest, you know, in some sense, we are all confined in our way of thinking. We are all confined to,

217
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,600
in many ways, we all think the way the Enlightenment philosophers, when I mean we, I mean, we,

218
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,920
modern society, we all think the way Enlightenment philosophers told us the thing, that that's how

219
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,360
we were told to perceive and understand the world. And as Wittgenstein so brilliantly put it, once

220
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,280
you climb up that Wittgensteinian ladder of just philosophy and propositions or rationality, let's

221
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,520
say, one must transcend it, one must throw it away and move beyond it. So I'm not going to be

222
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,680
transcending that ladder or going to a different philosophy, rather I'll be coming to something

223
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,800
a bit more grounded, a topic that I think we can understand a bit more, which is psychology.

224
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,480
And that leads me to a point, which I've been trying to understand and probably explicate

225
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,320
in some way. It is that utopian thinking, scientific utopianism, any kind of utopian

226
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,880
thinking is, psychologically speaking, essentially totalitarian. And understanding why the psychology

227
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,880
of utopianism is totalitarian isn't some philosophical game, at least in the analytical

228
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:21,200
sense. It's rather deeply experiential. It's having this unbelievable amount of self-awareness where

229
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:29,520
when one has a thought, where one has an idea or some kind of ideal one striving towards,

230
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,920
I think it's really important to be deeply introspective. And I'd even say try and observe

231
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:42,560
oneself without any moral judgment from a third person perspective. See what emotions rise,

232
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:51,120
see what makes me or whoever. Why am I thinking this way? Am I being totalitarian? Am I being

233
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,240
absolutist in my quote unquote remedies to the world's problems or my own problems?

234
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,680
And I think then we all come to the realization that utopianism is always totalitarian in nature.

235
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,000
Because knowing oneself is knowing how one comes to their conclusion. It's good or bad.

236
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,360
And what we're capable of doing once we have those conclusions. And to be honest, sometimes

237
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,600
that's a deeply terrifying realization. As psychoanalysts have told us, human beings have an innate

238
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,680
nature to us. However, this doesn't necessarily mean we're all the same. We differ in our interests,

239
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,440
temperaments, proclivities, idiosyncrasies, and certainly physiologically. A manifest example

240
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,920
of these differences is shown in the moral foundations theory, popularized in Jonathan

241
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,960
Hyde's book, The Righteous Mind. The basic idea of the theory is that our moral intuitions come

242
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,200
from certain foundations and concerns, some of these even mutually opposed, that we nonetheless value

243
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,320
in informing the moral basis for our beliefs. It could be because of these fundamental differences,

244
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,040
we find it difficult to see eye to eye on social, religious, and political matters.

245
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,520
And so far, I don't think any of these findings are controversial or worrisome. I don't think we

246
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,640
need a thorough knowledge of social psychology to understand that we all differ, even though it

247
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,840
might help us empathize more with people of different views to our own, if we know how and why

248
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,200
they develop these worldviews. But what deeply perturbs me is the claim Jonathan Hyde makes in

249
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,520
his book of social intuitionism, where we form our views through intuition rather than rationality.

250
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,160
And furthermore, we actually use rational port to justify our initial belief. Using the elephant

251
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,040
and the rider metaphor, he says we don't come to our beliefs through rationality as some of the

252
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,040
enlightenment thinkers would like to proclaim. The oldest ideas in intellectual history is the

253
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,240
idea that the mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. And wherever you look east

254
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,240
or west, there's sort of an idea that there's some sort of higher, more reasoning area and then some

255
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:59,520
sort of lower, more animal-like faculty. Plato gives us many metaphors in the Timaeus. He says

256
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,800
that the gods created mankind. They put reason in those orbs, and orbs had a role on the ground,

257
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,120
so they had to create the bodies. So that's one metaphor. The other is the phaedrus,

258
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,320
reason is the charioteer, and the passions, the noble passions, the base passions, are the horses.

259
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,880
And if a man studies philosophy and learns to control those passions, then he can escape the

260
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,680
bondage of reincarnation and return to the gods. Now, I think this view, the idea that reason,

261
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,200
of course, Plato didn't say that reason is the master in most people, but he said it can be.

262
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,040
It is in philosophers, and everyone should strive for it, so he believed it was possible.

263
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,040
I think this view of reason has taken quite a beating since the 1990s, certainly from the

264
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,000
neuroscientists, who found that when you lose your emotionaries, you don't get hyper-rational.

265
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,200
In fact, you either become unable to really think, because reasoning actually depends critically on

266
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,160
emotion and intuition, or if you're still able to think at all, you become more like a psychopath

267
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,920
who simply doesn't have any emotions in forming his reasoning. So I think the reason as master

268
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,320
view has taken quite a beating, and I'll give it more of a beating, model two, the idea that

269
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,240
reason is a servant. This is, as you know, the model that I endorse, that reason is a great

270
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,840
helper, but it simply is not qualified to lead. But rather than speaking of reason as a slave,

271
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,920
which is Hume's word, or a servant, I think if we think about it as a really intelligent servant,

272
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,760
really more like a press secretary. This is Robert Gibbs, Obama's first press secretary,

273
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,160
and he's a very, very smart guy. They're partners. They work together, but you will never change

274
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,920
Obama's mind by convincing his press secretary that something is wrong. That's just not the way

275
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:43,680
the system's designed. So it just structurally can't happen that way. Now, Hume said that the

276
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,880
passions were the master. Jesse Prince embraces emotion straight out. He says we can do all

277
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,240
this work with emotion. I used to think that in the 90s. I don't think that anymore. I think we

278
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,800
really need to talk about intuition more broadly. A lot of the things I've studied have been moral

279
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,040
emotions, but as you'll see, there are many cases of gut feelings that aren't exactly emotions.

280
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,080
Now, you might say, well, okay, maybe reason's not the master, but it could certainly be an

281
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,240
equal partner. And this is the view that Josh Green has and that Darshan Arvayas has. Green

282
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:17,440
gives us the idea of Kant and Mill fighting it out in the brain. Darshan Arvayas uses the

283
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,920
metaphor of dancing. Now, it seems to me that if you have dancing, you have one person leading,

284
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,080
the other following, but she says, well, it's a different kind of dancing where they take turns.

285
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:33,840
Okay. But even if you downgrade it from master to equal partner, is the evidence that we have on

286
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,880
reasoning, is that consistent with reason, even playing an equal partner role? Is reasoning good

287
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,440
enough, independent enough to play the role of equal partner? I don't think so. So the science

288
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:53,520
that we hold in such high regard, much like reason is merely a tool to be used by our emotions and

289
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,680
intuitions. We may like to think in a sort of blank slate kind of way where these

290
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,240
emotionless, intuitionless automatons that simply follow the facts. And once we

291
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,400
have all the facts, we come to our conclusions, but we are not. And on a bit of a side note,

292
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,560
I personally like the fact that we simply aren't these automatons. I like the fact that

293
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,840
we have emotions. We are deeply feeling creatures. We aren't just merely governed by

294
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,760
reason alone. Now, I don't have time to get into it, but I would leave a link down below to a great,

295
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,960
great essay or story, a sort of allegorical story by Raymond Smully and called A Planet Without

296
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,880
Laughter, where he describes the paradox of what it would be like living in a reality

297
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,560
where we are only governed by reason. Anyways, I digress. Getting back to the video,

298
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:50,800
the problem now is whatever conclusion that we've come to, we believe that we came to this viewpoint

299
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:57,360
using reason and mere facts alone. And we think that regardless of the consequences,

300
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,440
whatever the outcome of our conclusion is, we must push through just by the consequences,

301
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,720
because we think the conclusion we have, the viewpoint we hold now, this is absolute truth,

302
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,480
because I came to this conclusion based purely on facts. Therefore, I must hold the truth,

303
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,840
and it just makes sense to go ahead and let that truth, let's say, actualize in the world.

304
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,360
It's in this kind of self-referential, self-fulfilling way of thinking what I mean by

305
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,240
totalitarian. It's to bring forth the utopia we will do whatever it takes, because we are 100%

306
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,000
absolutely accurate in our conclusions. And in modern times, this torturizing mentality manifests

307
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,200
in many ways, but I think the most salient way is in the name of science and reason. It's very

308
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,520
common for us to see a Ben Shapiro destroy someone with facts and logic, because he's got the facts,

309
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,240
he's got the logic, he's got all the answers. Therefore, he's absolutely right. Ben Shapiro

310
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,800
is a right-wing conservative guy, and it's a complete lie that the right wing is anti-science,

311
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,000
or the left wing is anti-science, or vice versa, or whatever. None of these sides are anti-science

312
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,800
or anti-recent. They're both pro-science and pro-recent, but the problem is they both think

313
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,640
that they come to their truth merely by using science and reason alone. But no, both these sides

314
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,120
don't come to their conclusions from just facts. They come to their conclusions to keep it a bit

315
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,520
more grounded, let's say, at least based on their moral foundations. So science, again, just becomes

316
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,640
a means to an end, that end which is created through their moral foundations. And these moral

317
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,240
foundations, left-wing, right-wing, conservative, liberal, whatever, doesn't matter. These foundations

318
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,480
aren't derived using a scientific method, because they aren't scientific truths and I'd even say

319
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,120
science isn't the only way to get at truth. And my fear, of course, is because our society is so

320
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:58,640
deeply, for all it's good, influenced by enlightenment thinking, and both sides, right or left, whatever

321
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:06,240
are influenced by science and reason, there's that aspect of totalitarianism that comes in,

322
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,480
and we move towards the dangers of scientific utopianism. You believe in the Crystal Palace,

323
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,520
eternally indestructible. That is, one at which you can never stick out your tongue

324
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,360
furtively, nor make a rude gesture, even with your fist head in a way. Well, perhaps I'm so afraid

325
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,400
of this building precisely because it's made of crystal and it's eternally indestructible,

326
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,880
and because it won't be possible to stick out one's tongue even furtively. So what's this Crystal

327
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,360
Palace Dostoevsky writes about? It's actually based on a real monument from the 19th century,

328
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,200
and I think it's deeply, in a very profound way, pertinent, in a symbolic sense, I'd say,

329
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,320
to the society we live in. It was this vast exhibition hall built of glass and iron in London

330
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,800
to house this great exhibition of 1851. And for the time, it was very technologically advanced,

331
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,080
and anyways, the specificities of it doesn't matter. What matters is, as I said, what it symbolizes.

332
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,600
In Russian literature, along with the Industrial Revolution, it symbolizes progress and this

333
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,480
move towards the utopian society. There were authors like Shona Shevsky who used it to represent

334
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,480
these utopian socialist communes that the people of the future would live in. And of course,

335
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,880
Dostoevsky rebukes his claims and says that, no, human beings don't desire utopia,

336
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,800
even if there was a utopia, we would end up destroying it because that's not what our heart

337
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,160
really wants. You know, my reading of Notes from Underground, which probably is the book

338
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,720
that I've read the most in my life, is that I think what Dostoevsky is trying to say is that

339
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,440
the human soul, the human beings are obviously very, very incomprehensible beings,

340
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,120
and we are all walking paradoxes, you know. In our souls, yes, we want to be safe,

341
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,320
we want to be happy and live a good life with well-being and all of that, but at the same time,

342
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:03,040
we also want to be free, in some sense, existentially free, and we would desire being free

343
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,920
than over-living in so-called paradises of the utopia. If we do live in a so-called utopian

344
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,560
paradise, if we didn't have this freedom of conscience, freedom in our soul to do as we

345
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:23,120
will in that paradise, we would still not prefer that. We'd still rather suffer and be free than

346
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,840
not be free and not have any suffering. So before I go on and on about Dostoevsky,

347
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,880
which I could do forever because I absolutely love his work, a good question to ask is,

348
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,400
why does any of this, the Crystal Palace, all of it, why does it matter to our times?

349
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,760
I think it's quite straightforward. It's because what the Crystal Palace represents

350
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:51,360
is the modern AI project, and I think Lex, as much as I love him, very much falls to this car,

351
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:59,280
I guess, trap or this way of thinking about AI the same way maybe thinkers of that time

352
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,400
poured about the Crystal Palace. We look to technology to be our savior, we look to AI or

353
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:12,480
whatever it is to be humanity's redeemer, savior, and to be the means that gets us the utopia.

354
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,320
Such utopian thinking isn't necessarily a modern phenomenon, nor is it merely a product of scientific

355
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,160
advancement. For example, we see forms of it in the Tower of Babel, a very ancient story from the

356
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:29,760
Bible. My point being, it's not the object or theory we project this desire onto that matters,

357
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,880
but the psychic phenomena of that desire itself. It doesn't matter if it's the Tower of Babel,

358
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,080
Crystal Palace, AI, or Steven Pinker's Enlightenment Rationalism. What we should be

359
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:46,160
attentive towards is the totalizing impulse we have to attribute a certain thing, scientific or not,

360
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,440
to be the panacea to all our problems. Furthermore, since utopianism inevitably becomes

361
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,960
totalitarian, it is all-encompassing and doesn't leave any room for fragments of being that are

362
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,240
outside a given utopian ideology. It's a similar idea that Jordan Peterson and Jonathan Peugeot

363
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,600
discussed in a recent podcast about the key difference between heaven and utopia.

364
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,720
Heaven is generally conceptualized. You can conceptualize it as a state of being. It might

365
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,160
be the state of being that those people that you described live in have had paradisal experiences

366
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,400
where everything transformed itself into something that was perfect, that appeared perfect,

367
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:33,760
and I was unable to stay in those frames of mind. The heaven, is that something we build?

368
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:40,000
Is that something? I don't understand the relationship between the heaven that awaits us,

369
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,920
let's say, after we die. That's the idea and what we build here on earth. Do those touches?

370
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,920
Is that the doctrine? There's so much of this doctrine I don't understand.

371
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,200
At all. I think a way to see it has to do with attention again, and it has to do with a hierarchy

372
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:07,200
of attention. If you try to build heaven, you're going to fail. You're going to fail miserably

373
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,240
because you're not aiming high enough. You're aiming and then you get stuck in this

374
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,360
in these weird world of opposites that you don't even understand the side effects of what you're

375
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,680
doing. For one person, heaven will look like if everything could be perfectly ordered then,

376
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,680
right, and then we know what that looks like. Another person will look at heaven and think,

377
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,640
if everything could be free, we could all just be free and then that we know what that looks like.

378
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,520
The idea is to look higher. There's a story that I've been had.

379
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,680
We have to strive for something better, but then we end up in, which is what you're saying,

380
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,440
is that we end up with the Tower of Babel or we end up with the flood or we end up with

381
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,920
the catastrophe, continual catastrophe of unintended consequences. But

382
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,800
as you yourself said, we are aiming for something better. The question is, how do you pursue Utopia

383
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,480
while avoiding the pitfalls? That's a theological question. Yeah, it is. I think it,

384
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,720
I know people are going to hate that I say this, but it has to do with worship. It has to do with

385
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,440
what you worship. So if you worship those things that you're aiming towards, the lower things,

386
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,200
if you worship the making a safer society, if you worship the making a freer society,

387
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,240
if you worship making a stronger society, all of these things are going to go off the rails

388
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,600
because they have unintended consequences that you don't understand because they're a fragment

389
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,400
of reality. They need to be encompassed together in order to reach something higher.

390
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,600
That's the danger of ideology. It's the part that takes the place of the whole.

391
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:58,240
The idea is that if you worship God, then those other things will

392
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,920
will kind of lay themselves out slowly and you won't be able to force them. They'll kind of lay

393
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,960
themselves out slowly and they'll start to manifest, you know, progressively and as you,

394
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,320
but you have to attend to the highest. With scientific utopianism, one value is divinized

395
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,560
and science becomes the means to bring forth the ends. The safety, freedom, order, or even

396
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,480
technological progress with no regard to any other value, or even the ramifications of said value.

397
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,880
And since science itself is only a tool that's malleable and has no way of justifying the

398
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,280
means it uses, that one value that all utopians pursue become the only thing that matters.

399
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,560
There's no balance, no nuance, no context as utopianism lacks and hierarchy of values.

400
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,760
After all, utopia was derived from the Greek meaning nowhere and there probably is a good

401
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,800
reason for that. Regardless of our philosophical or religious beliefs, I think a laudable goal for

402
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:00,240
all of us, I'd even say the motivating spirit of the scientific enterprise should be to bring heaven

403
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,240
on earth. I truly believe a lot of people, especially those like Lex, who just have a

404
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,080
big heart and just truly loves life and humanity and everything that comes along

405
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:16,480
with the baggage of being, let's say. I believe the goal of most scientists and a lot of people

406
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,800
is this, it's to make life on earth better. It's the motivating spirit, it's to in some sense,

407
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,960
yes, to bring heaven on earth. And this is in no way an anti-science or even worse, an anti-scientist

408
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,640
video. I really hope I didn't convey that I was being cynical in that sense because absolutely

409
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,360
not. I mean, I work in committee science, I'm a software engineer and my field wouldn't exist if

410
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:45,600
not for this world of science that I review and love so much. I could never forgive myself for such

411
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:53,920
lazy, casual cynicism. Rather, the intent or the purpose of this video was to try and contextualize

412
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:01,280
science. It was to try and understand in the hierarchical topology of epistemology where the

413
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,040
science stands. A lot of big words I know, but plainly in a broader culture, what's the role

414
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,120
science plays? Because I think by understanding this, we not only make the scientific enterprise,

415
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:19,440
we not only make that a much more fruitful endeavor, but we also make the human experience

416
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,800
much more richer and substantial. And Lex, of course, is a good example of what happens when

417
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:32,720
the scientist and the poet meets. So saying all that, please do consider sharing this video with

418
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,720
Lex. That would be a dream come true. Thanks for watching.
