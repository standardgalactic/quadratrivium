00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the inner realm podcast. It's been a while. Yes,

00:05.840 --> 00:13.440
indeed. I took a small break from podcasting and sort of focused a bit more on computer science and

00:13.440 --> 00:19.840
software engineering type content, which I shall be uploading on the YouTube channel too. But I'm

00:20.640 --> 00:28.000
happy and excited to get back on the podcast again. I have some great conversations lined up,

00:28.000 --> 00:34.240
but also on top of that, some of my own pieces that I'm putting together, I propose

00:34.800 --> 00:41.680
Heidegger and phenomenology. So clearly, please give me a bit of time and a bit of grace because

00:41.680 --> 00:47.120
obviously it's not easy stuff to comprehend, man. I'll tell you that. Heidegger is most certainly

00:47.120 --> 00:55.360
dense and it's hard to really get him. However, today I'll be focusing on something I started

00:55.360 --> 01:01.680
a couple of months ago, reading out these guiding axioms from my newsletter. So I've already laid

01:01.680 --> 01:06.480
down seven axioms. I've been writing a bit on the background and I've been, I want to read all of

01:06.480 --> 01:11.440
them out in this podcast because something I realized was, oh, these, these guiding axioms that

01:11.440 --> 01:15.920
I'm laying down for the newsletter, the unhappy man newsletter, by the way, if I didn't already

01:15.920 --> 01:21.040
mentioned that links down below in the description if you want to subscribe to it. And in any case,

01:21.040 --> 01:30.960
these axioms are essentially a, an heralding framework for all of my, let's say creative work.

01:31.600 --> 01:38.160
Any content I produce on the podcast or anything that I write, I want to ensure that I do it within

01:38.160 --> 01:43.920
the, I don't want to say bounce because that sounds restrictive, but at least these axioms will be

01:43.920 --> 01:49.520
sort of a framework for me to work through. And it also helps lay down my thoughts as to

01:50.320 --> 01:55.840
why the bloody hell do I do any of this in the first place? To be fair, I haven't got an answer

01:55.840 --> 02:05.360
to that yet. Well, that's a whole other conversation, but today's guiding axiom number two is only

02:05.360 --> 02:12.720
gold can patronize. And the previous axiom I covered was restrain the urge to overcome

02:12.720 --> 02:19.120
unhappiness with ideological prescription. If you haven't listened to watch that episode already,

02:19.520 --> 02:23.920
I'll leave a link to that in the description down below too. But today it's guiding axiom,

02:23.920 --> 02:33.440
guiding axiom. I, for some reason, I, I keep saying guardians of the galaxy or like,

02:33.440 --> 02:41.200
guardian axiom. It's odd. Guiding axiom number two is only gold can patronize.

02:42.720 --> 02:46.320
So I've said here, the following is a second guiding axiom for this newsletter.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.800
Yeah, happy man. It's one of the many that I hope to share in the upcoming weeks. I wrote this a

02:50.800 --> 02:56.560
while back, so I've already shared these. As I'm writing these, it's dawn on me that these aren't

02:56.560 --> 03:03.120
a mere helm solely for writing, but rather I seem to be setting up a framework for all of my creative

03:03.120 --> 03:10.000
life itself. As I said before, so thank you. And yes, I mean that sincerely. Thank you for letting

03:10.000 --> 03:15.840
me be self-indulgent in this manner. It is, I've always thought a lot of what I do is rather

03:15.840 --> 03:21.040
self-indulgent, but I take no shame in the matter. There's nothing wrong with a bit of,

03:21.040 --> 03:25.600
a bit of good nature, self-indulgence, self-indulgence or egoism, let's say.

03:27.120 --> 03:33.680
Okay, let's get started. I feel a deep love for Jesus Christ. Does anyone that dares to call

03:33.680 --> 03:40.480
himself Gordon Connard, it ought to be Christ? But he also exasperates me by saying things like this.

03:41.520 --> 03:48.160
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children

03:48.160 --> 03:53.600
or lands, for my namesake, shall receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life.

03:54.960 --> 04:02.160
Matthew, 1929. I can only imagine the overweening goal at hubris one has to make such supercilious

04:02.160 --> 04:09.520
proclamations. If anyone else made such demands of me, I tell them to go take a hike. And that's

04:09.520 --> 04:15.840
me being polite to keep this newsletter decent. Pause. What I meant to really say there was,

04:16.400 --> 04:22.560
I tell them to fuck off. I don't know why I was censoring myself there. Most contemporary

04:22.560 --> 04:29.040
theologians tend to eschew Christianity and present a tepid, mellowed down version of it

04:29.120 --> 04:35.120
for a more emasculated audience. But Jesus meant what he explicitly stated. And there's no getting

04:35.120 --> 04:42.000
around it with hermeneutical trickery. In that sense, I'm a Christian not for its reasonableness,

04:42.000 --> 04:49.600
but instead for its sheer radicalism and scandalous unreasonableness. Perhaps it's the

04:49.600 --> 04:55.520
audacity for Jesus to casually patronize the masses that truly makes him Gordon Connard.

04:56.480 --> 05:02.720
I doubt even the most egomaniacal narcissists think of themselves as humanity's savior.

05:04.240 --> 05:10.560
I'm not anyone's savior. Hang out for that. The burden of such a responsibility would be

05:10.560 --> 05:17.920
too unbearable. I'm happy to leave that with Christ. Therefore, I will not patronize and

05:17.920 --> 05:24.720
talk down to anyone. Presumably, only the Son of God can do that. So, I won't molecule the reader

05:24.720 --> 05:30.720
with superfluous, so I won't molecule the reader or listener in this case, with superfluous caveats

05:30.720 --> 05:37.520
and footnotes. If what I write isn't clear, then it's either my fault for being an inept writer

05:37.520 --> 05:42.880
and I need to improve my craft or you need to educate yourself and learn to wrestle with a

05:42.880 --> 05:49.680
given piece to extract its meaning. I suspect that the former will be the case most of the time.

05:50.160 --> 05:56.000
Besides, reading should not be treated as a leisurely activity one engages into past one's time.

05:57.120 --> 06:04.240
I point that the commitment towards lucidity lies within both parties. If we repudiate

06:04.240 --> 06:10.560
this responsibility without inability to struggle with the peace of creation anymore,

06:10.560 --> 06:16.560
artistic, philosophical or otherwise, we're forever trapped in the banality of modern life.

06:17.520 --> 06:22.720
Perhaps, it's similar to what David Foster Wallace observed about popular

06:22.720 --> 06:28.480
entertainment, which has capitulated to a lust for immediacy and constant sensuousness.

06:29.440 --> 06:37.040
Christly put, for us post-industrial modernists, art has no qualitative value over yet another

06:37.040 --> 06:43.120
commercial action flick, fast food or pornography. Is this the post-modern curse?

06:43.440 --> 06:51.440
So, modern art has to be dumbed down to attract the masses. Nothing is more patronizing and

06:51.440 --> 06:57.440
insulting to the human spirit than this. It's not egalitarianism, but a peculiar form of

06:57.440 --> 07:04.400
aristocratic bigotry. For Wallace, the arts, especially literature, can bring unspeakable

07:04.400 --> 07:10.880
depth and meaning to our lives, but it requires toil. It should never be treated as a distraction

07:10.880 --> 07:17.680
but rather as something that accentuates and reveals all of life itself. For instance, I thought

07:17.680 --> 07:23.680
eminent artists and philosophers intentionally obfuscated their work for pretentiousness and

07:23.680 --> 07:30.320
elitism. Well, there certainly are cases where this is true. Vanity takes many forms. The more

07:30.320 --> 07:37.200
I've labored at reading and immersing myself in art and philosophy, I've concluded that it's mostly

07:37.200 --> 07:45.440
my ignorance and complacency. It rarely was the piece of work, but my indolent unwillingness to

07:45.440 --> 07:51.520
persevere through. In that spirit, I will not treat any of my readers or listeners as lost sheep in

07:51.520 --> 07:58.000
need of a good, sagacious shepherd. Besides, apart from the reasons mentioned above, it's also because

07:58.000 --> 08:04.320
I must admit, in all candor, I'm starting this newsletter or podcast primarily for a selfish

08:04.320 --> 08:10.960
reason. It's a forum for me about everyone else to seek truth, if such a thing exists and it's

08:10.960 --> 08:18.480
even knowable to us. Then you may ask why I share my writings publicly. Partially, it's for criticism

08:18.480 --> 08:24.320
and feedback so that I can update my perspectives, a contrived form of collective cognition and

08:24.320 --> 08:32.480
decision making, so to speak. It may be pomp and vanity too, but predominantly because I profoundly

08:32.480 --> 08:40.080
resonate with an adage, apocryphally attributed to Carl R. Rogers, Carl Rogers, the American

08:40.080 --> 08:47.280
humanist psychologist. What is most personal is most universal. I think the essence of this

08:47.280 --> 08:52.240
sentiment, it caused that unforgettable line from Schindler's List taken from the Talmud,

08:53.120 --> 09:01.040
he who saves one life, saves the world entire. Of course, I'm not at least consciously

09:01.040 --> 09:07.920
in the world saving business, but it rings true that the individual struggle is the human struggle.

09:08.480 --> 09:15.440
The individual questions are instantiations of the seeking human heart. For one to suffer is for

09:15.440 --> 09:22.240
many to suffer and to love another is to love humanity and entire. Perhaps, God has no other

09:22.240 --> 09:29.440
option than to create us in his own image, so that as that's what being human ontologically means,

09:30.160 --> 09:36.480
where a locus of divine paradoxes, or as Justice F.C. wrote, the awful thing is that beauty is

09:36.480 --> 09:42.720
mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are fighting there and the battlefield

09:42.720 --> 09:48.880
is the heart of man. If he weren't created in his image, then he wouldn't be human beings,

09:48.880 --> 09:54.640
but some other thing. Such claims can never be proven intellectually, but only be made

09:54.640 --> 10:02.960
realize to run through life alone. You may never entirely comprehend what it feels like

10:02.960 --> 10:08.960
when I say I'm in pain or agony, nor can you ever take my place and feel it for me,

10:09.520 --> 10:15.840
but you still know what I mean when I say I'm hurting. While we undoubtedly have our subjective

10:15.840 --> 10:22.640
individual experience that can never be generalized, represented as a mere categorical abstraction,

10:22.640 --> 10:29.360
that to my great annoyance, modern psychology tends to do, we also have a trans-subjective

10:29.360 --> 10:36.320
common human experience. And writing with the exception of music, I find, is the most beautiful

10:36.320 --> 10:43.040
way of tapping into our shared realm, such as why I believe only God can patronize,

10:43.040 --> 10:49.440
and I will never patronize ever in this podcast. At least, that is what I'm striving to do. Thanks

10:49.440 --> 10:51.440
for watching.
