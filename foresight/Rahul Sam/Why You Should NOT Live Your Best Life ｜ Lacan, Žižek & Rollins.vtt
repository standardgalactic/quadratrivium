00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hey everyone, today I want to make the case as to why you should not live your best life

00:04.000 --> 00:09.120
using the ideas of Jacques Lacourne, Slavoj Zizek, sprinkled in with a bit of the theology of Peter

00:09.120 --> 00:15.040
Orleans. Now firstly, of course, let's try and understand what the thesis I'm trying to negate

00:15.040 --> 00:21.280
here is. What do I mean by living your best life? I think the best way to make sense of this, let's

00:21.280 --> 00:28.880
call it societal, cultural imposition is to go through podcasts that people consume and the books

00:28.880 --> 00:34.400
people read. So if you look at contemporary culture and if you look at, let's say, kind of

00:34.400 --> 00:41.200
consumerist, productivist, moral injunctions, if you look at, let's say, the Amazon bestseller list,

00:41.200 --> 00:48.240
which I have opened right here. I just googled it for this video. You'll see some of the bestselling

00:48.240 --> 00:53.440
books are in the self-help category. Books like Atomic Habits or Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for

00:53.440 --> 00:58.080
Life. And yes, there's some pop fiction, but there certainly are many books that are either in the

00:58.080 --> 01:05.040
personal finance or the self-help category, along with the New Age self-actualization

01:05.600 --> 01:11.760
category books, books like Eckhart Tolle, people like that. And if you look at the top podcasts,

01:11.760 --> 01:16.640
the podcasts like Andrew Huberman's, what's it called, the Huberman Lab podcast, which is

01:16.640 --> 01:24.560
a pretty good podcast on health and well-being, but people certainly obsess over the tips that

01:24.560 --> 01:32.720
Andrew Huberman gives on how to optimize your life, how to optimize your brain or your physiology

01:32.720 --> 01:39.200
and whatnot. And then of course, another example, which probably is a bit more from, even before my

01:39.200 --> 01:47.440
time really, is the book The Secret by, what's her name, the Australian Bern, whoever, Ronda

01:47.440 --> 01:54.160
Bern, right? So this book, just according to Wikipedia, it's sold over 30 million copies worldwide.

01:54.160 --> 01:58.160
That's a lot of copies. And that certainly is a bestseller that there was a documentary about

01:58.160 --> 02:04.560
this book. People still talk about things like the law of attraction and this kind of, I call it

02:04.560 --> 02:14.000
toxic positivity, where the, it seems like in our culture, the imposition, kind of the imposition

02:14.000 --> 02:23.200
by God himself in many ways is to live your best life, to self-actualize, to be as productive as

02:23.200 --> 02:29.360
you can be, to be as healthy as you can be. And not only that, to also in the more of the consumerist

02:29.360 --> 02:36.320
crass, crude sense, to have as much as you want to have, not merely in the sense of just, let's say,

02:36.880 --> 02:42.640
material things like clothes and shoes and cars and watches or whatnot, but even experiences,

02:42.640 --> 02:47.200
travel, experience the world. And of course, we have, you know, terms, colloquial terms like

02:47.200 --> 02:54.320
FOMO, the fear of missing out and whatnot. And all of this comes from this deep seated imposition

02:54.320 --> 03:00.880
that we put onto ourselves, ironically, or rather, physically, I'd say, to live your best life.

03:01.840 --> 03:08.560
And the question is, what does that mean? Why do we always feel guilty for not living our best

03:08.560 --> 03:13.680
life? Why do we always feel guilty for missing out, not just on things that are purely entertaining,

03:13.680 --> 03:20.400
but even on things like self-actualization and becoming divine in some sense and becoming whole

03:20.400 --> 03:26.240
or to use a more technical term? Why do we always have this desire for ontological wholeness?

03:26.240 --> 03:31.600
One way to answer that question is through the ideas of Peter Rollins, who says that we are subjects

03:31.600 --> 03:37.200
of the Achievement Society. Our culture is a culture of self-help and achievement. We

03:37.840 --> 03:47.440
have to live our best lives. The kind of the imperative by God himself, even though most

03:47.440 --> 03:53.840
people in modernity are so-called atheists, is to self-actualize, to live your best life.

03:53.840 --> 03:58.320
And unlike in the past, the categorical imperative to use a content term or simply

03:59.040 --> 04:05.760
what we are ought to do, what we should do was, you know, don't lie, don't shoot, don't murder,

04:06.240 --> 04:10.400
don't commit adultery, all the, you know, typical traditional Christian virtues, let's say.

04:11.360 --> 04:17.360
The categorical imperative of our times, the demands of our times, is to achieve. And that's why

04:17.360 --> 04:22.400
Peter Rollins says we are subjects. We are people living in Achievement Society or Achievement

04:22.400 --> 04:27.040
Culture, because that is ultimately what we're supposed to do, achieve. And if you could take

04:27.040 --> 04:31.440
those ideas of achievement or living your best life, which seem a bit more metaphysical and,

04:31.440 --> 04:36.640
let's say, try and make them a bit more psychoanalytical, the best way to put it is in

04:36.640 --> 04:40.880
Na'a Slavu Žižek's catchphrase, which is enjoy a super ego.

04:40.880 --> 04:47.040
The traditional notion of psychoanalysis is that because of some inner obstacles you internalized,

04:47.040 --> 04:52.640
identified excessively, excessively with paternal or other social prohibitions, you cannot

04:53.360 --> 04:59.920
set yourself free to enjoy, to pleasure is not accessible for you. It is accessible to you only

05:00.000 --> 05:06.560
in pathological forms of feeling guilty and so on. So then the idea is psychoanalysis allows you to

05:06.560 --> 05:14.080
suspend, overcome these internalized prohibitions so that it enables you to enjoy. The problem today

05:14.080 --> 05:22.480
is that the commandment of the ruling ideologies enjoy in different ways. It can be sexual enjoyment,

05:23.440 --> 05:28.800
consumption, commodity enjoyment, up to spiritual enjoyment, realize yourself, whatever. And I think

05:29.360 --> 05:36.240
that the problem today is not how to get rid of your inhibitions and to be able to spontaneously

05:36.240 --> 05:40.800
enjoy. The problem is how to get rid of this injunction to enjoy. Now, before I get to the

05:40.800 --> 05:45.760
negation to keep fleshing this idea out, I'm going to use two books by Slavu Žižek. The first one

05:45.760 --> 05:51.200
is perhaps his most, one of his most accessible books, How to Read Lacan, and the second one is

05:51.200 --> 05:57.120
certainly one of his hardest books to read for they know not what they do. Here's what he says

05:57.120 --> 06:02.480
about super ego or enjoys super ego in How to Read Lacan and after I read from both these books,

06:02.480 --> 06:08.960
I'll kind of explain what he means here. Žižek states, super ego is real, the cruel and insatiable

06:08.960 --> 06:14.880
agency that bombards me with the impossible demands and then mocks my botched attempts to meet them.

06:15.440 --> 06:22.480
The agency in whose eyes I am all the more guilty, the more I try to suppress my sinful

06:22.560 --> 06:28.560
strivings and meet its demands. The cynical old Stalinist motto about the accused at show trials

06:28.560 --> 06:33.600
who profess their innocence, the more innocent they are, the more they deserve to be shot,

06:33.600 --> 06:39.360
is super ego at its purest. For Lacan, super ego has nothing to do with moral conscience as far as

06:39.360 --> 06:46.240
its most obligatory demands are concerned. Super ego is, on the contrary, the anti-ethical agency,

06:46.240 --> 06:52.160
the segmentation of my ethical betrayal. So that except I read is a very, I call that summarized

06:52.400 --> 06:59.600
or called down version of a very perspicacious idea that Žižek has been writing about ever

06:59.600 --> 07:04.960
ever since he's been writing really. The idea that the Lacanian super ego, at least in modernity

07:04.960 --> 07:10.160
in our culture, is quite different to what we would, let's say, conventionally think about the

07:10.160 --> 07:17.440
Freudian super ego, where generally if you ask from any person who has any idea of who Freud is

07:17.440 --> 07:23.760
and you bring up the concept of the super ego, let's say the super ego is this ethical agency,

07:23.760 --> 07:27.440
kind of like the, again, the Kantian categorical imperative that talks about, you know, don't

07:27.440 --> 07:33.520
lie, don't cheat, be a good person, carry out your civic duties, whatnot. Although our culture,

07:33.520 --> 07:41.200
things have shifted. Our super ego is the imperative, as I said many times already, to in fact be

07:41.200 --> 07:48.800
anti-ethical. In fact, to not in a hedonistic sense, to an indulge, indulge, indulge, but rather

07:49.680 --> 07:56.720
it's to the demand itself is to live your best life, as I said in this video. And ironically,

07:56.720 --> 08:01.040
a part of living your best life is certainly being anti-ethical and doing things that are

08:01.040 --> 08:06.320
moral transgressions, so to speak. But also, again, the new age of self actualization and whatnot.

08:06.960 --> 08:11.680
But then comes the important point where he makes the cynical Stalinist joke that

08:12.320 --> 08:16.800
the reality of the super ego demands are that they can never be met. And in fact, the more we

08:16.800 --> 08:22.400
carry them out, the guiltier we feel, the more we engage in self help, the more we engage in

08:23.200 --> 08:27.200
productivity, reading all these books and listening to all these podcasts or the other

08:27.200 --> 08:32.880
side of things, the more consumerist we become, the more we try to experience new things and

08:32.960 --> 08:40.080
constantly pursue novelty, the less emptier and more guilty we feel in the sense that we always

08:40.080 --> 08:45.760
feel we aren't doing enough. And that's the cruel, sadistic nature of the super ego. So that idea

08:45.760 --> 08:50.480
of the super ego demands being unfulfillable brings us to an excerpt from this book for they

08:50.480 --> 08:56.400
know what they do, where initially, before I read the excerpt, Gizek states that as we probably all

08:56.400 --> 09:03.280
kind of intuit at least, we all kind of feel it that in post-modern culture, we have no

09:03.920 --> 09:11.920
moral laws to say. We have no substructure that guides us in how traditional societies did guide

09:11.920 --> 09:18.000
us in the sense that most people are atheistic, we have no metaphysical principles, and we don't

09:18.000 --> 09:24.800
have a lot of prohibitions. Now, of course, the naive way to view that is we think, oh, that means

09:24.800 --> 09:32.480
we can live in infinite bliss and freedom. There isn't all these old patriarchal ways of existence,

09:32.480 --> 09:39.440
we could just be free. It's not so simple. Here's what Gizek states. He states, how do we

09:39.440 --> 09:45.040
account for this paradox that the absence of law universalizes prohibition? There's only one possible

09:45.040 --> 09:52.560
explanation. Enjoyment itself, which we experience as transgression, is in its innermost status something

09:52.560 --> 09:59.360
imposed, ordered, when we enjoy. We never do it spontaneously. We always follow a certain injunction.

10:00.320 --> 10:06.240
The psychoanalytical name for this obscene injunction, for this obscene call, enjoy your super ego.

10:06.240 --> 10:13.360
So here's where all the ideas connect. In the past, the universal law, the Kantian categorical

10:13.360 --> 10:21.040
imperative, was prohibition. Do not do this. Whereas now, in our post-modern culture, it is

10:21.040 --> 10:26.960
you ought to do this. You must do this. You should do this. You must read this many self-help books.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.720
You must listen to all these productivity podcasts. You must take care of your health.

10:31.280 --> 10:37.920
You must focus solely on your well-being and on your health. You must have this much money. You

10:37.920 --> 10:43.280
must own this thing. You must have this experience, so on and so on. You get the point. And of course,

10:43.280 --> 10:49.040
that begs the question, if the current imperative, and we can't detach ourselves from these imperatives

10:49.040 --> 10:55.280
there, there, regardless of whether we like them or not, how do we live our best life? Unfortunately,

10:55.280 --> 10:59.200
here's where things get a bit dark. It's impossible. It's primarily due to reasons,

10:59.200 --> 11:04.880
because firstly, we don't really want to live our best life. What we want to do is to fantasize

11:04.880 --> 11:10.560
about living our best life, but never really live it. You have a serious ideological deviation at the

11:10.560 --> 11:16.800
very beginning of famous proclamation of independence, you know, pursuit of happiness.

11:16.880 --> 11:24.480
If there is a point in psychoanalysis, it is that people do not really want or desire happiness.

11:24.480 --> 11:30.000
And I think it's good that it is like that. For example, let's be serious. When you are in a

11:30.000 --> 11:36.160
creative endeavor in that wonderful fever, my God, I'm on to somethings and so on, happiness

11:36.160 --> 11:41.680
doesn't enter it. You are ready to suffer. Sometimes scientists, I read history of quantum

11:41.680 --> 11:47.600
physics or earlier of radiation, were even ready to take into account the possibility that they will

11:47.600 --> 11:53.040
die because of some radiation and so on. You know, happiness is for me an unethical category.

11:53.040 --> 12:03.040
And also, we don't really want to get what we think that we want. The classical story that I like,

12:03.040 --> 12:09.200
the traditional Meyshovinist scenario. I am married to a wife, relations with her are cold,

12:09.200 --> 12:14.240
and I have a mistress. And all the time, I dream, oh my God, if my wife were to disappear,

12:14.240 --> 12:20.800
I'm not a murderer. But let us say, drop me, it would open up new life for me with the mistress.

12:20.800 --> 12:25.840
You know what? Every psychoanalyst will tell you quite often happens that then, for some reason,

12:25.840 --> 12:32.800
wife goes away, you lose the mistress also. You thought, this is all I want. When you have it there,

12:33.760 --> 12:39.200
you turn out that it was a much more complex situation where what you want is not really to

12:39.200 --> 12:45.520
live with the mistress, but to keep her as a distance, as an object of desire about which

12:45.520 --> 12:50.880
you dream. And this is not just an excessive situation. I claim that this is how things

12:50.880 --> 12:56.800
function. We don't really want what we think we desire. And of course, manifest and consumerism,

12:56.800 --> 13:01.760
as we all know, the more we shop, the more we buy things and purchase things, the more we want to

13:01.760 --> 13:07.600
shop and buy and purchase things. What we are really looking for is in that case, not a particular

13:08.240 --> 13:14.080
consumable item, not a particular commodity, but rather at a fundamental ontological level,

13:14.080 --> 13:19.680
what we desire is the object, this virtual void that isn't there. But perhaps even more

13:19.680 --> 13:25.520
pertinently to our times, leaving consumerism aside, because it seems rather obvious, it is also

13:25.520 --> 13:31.680
the fact that we never do really want our desire to be ever met. Despite the fact that it's

13:31.760 --> 13:37.760
unfulfillable, regardless, what we want to do is fantasize about this object, about getting

13:37.760 --> 13:44.160
whatever this virtual category is, this empty virtual category is. And perhaps the quintessential

13:44.160 --> 13:50.240
example is something like Paris syndrome, where as we all know, it's a phenomenon where many,

13:50.240 --> 13:58.240
many people, many, many tourists, whoever, they always fantasize about Paris. And once they do

13:58.320 --> 14:03.520
go to Paris, once they do go to France, they see that it's just the brutal reality of what it is

14:03.520 --> 14:09.040
and they see that it's just another stupid country. Of course, what they really were fantasizing about

14:09.040 --> 14:15.600
wasn't Paris the actual material place, rather the object. And I think Gizek puts it best

14:15.600 --> 14:20.080
where he says that, if there's anything psychoanalysis has told us, that is that human beings

14:20.080 --> 14:25.520
fundamentally don't want to be happy or don't want their desires to be met. So to keep expanding

14:25.520 --> 14:29.760
on this idea a bit more theoretically, Todd McGovern elucidates it really well in his book,

14:29.760 --> 14:35.680
Capitalism and Desire, he states, capitalism is the effect of sustaining subjects in a constant

14:35.680 --> 14:41.360
state of desire. As subjects of capitalism, we are constantly on the edge of having our desire

14:41.360 --> 14:48.000
realized, but never reached the point of realization. This has the effect of producing a satisfaction

14:48.000 --> 14:54.640
that we don't recognize as such, that is, capitalist subjects experience satisfaction itself as

14:54.640 --> 15:01.120
dissatisfying, which enables them to simultaneously enjoy themselves and believe wholeheartedly

15:01.120 --> 15:07.200
that a more complete satisfaction exists just around the corner embodied in the newest commodity.

15:07.200 --> 15:11.280
So of course, when McGovern talks about capitalism, he's also talking about the

15:12.080 --> 15:16.560
capitalist ideology, which is the kind of the culture that I'm talking about of living your best

15:16.560 --> 15:22.160
life. And I'm sorry to quote myself here, but a little commentary on what Todd McGovern wrote.

15:22.240 --> 15:26.640
Here's what I wrote. And again, I'm sorry for narcissistically quoting myself.

15:28.080 --> 15:34.320
Since our lack is unfulfillable and our desire is unmeetable, we are the perfect subjects for

15:34.320 --> 15:40.400
capitalist dynamics because paradoxically, capitalism works by not working. We are always

15:40.400 --> 15:46.800
kept on the edge of having our desires met by, in fact, not having them ever met in reality.

15:46.800 --> 15:54.160
So you could replace the word capitalism with new age, with self-help, and the idea would still

15:54.160 --> 16:00.000
apply. And then we come to the other concept, which is perhaps one of Lacan's deepest ideas,

16:00.000 --> 16:06.400
where he famously said, desire full stop is always the desire of the other, which basically means

16:06.400 --> 16:11.920
that we are always asking the other what he desires. And this is where Jujak states in his book,

16:11.920 --> 16:16.640
but even in the video I just showed you, that our desires, what we are supposed to do,

16:16.640 --> 16:22.160
living your best life, whatever it may be, don't come in any authentic, spontaneous sense.

16:22.160 --> 16:27.680
It always comes by the other, which is our sociosymbolic reality of culture, of society,

16:29.040 --> 16:33.760
and it manifests in many ways. It's true, of course, the very conspicuous marketing

16:34.080 --> 16:41.680
of celebrity culture, but even in more subtle ways, where it could be completely unconscious.

16:42.800 --> 16:46.800
Nonetheless, our desires are always coming to us from society.

16:46.800 --> 16:53.440
Okay, so it seems like using these Lacanian ideas of psychoanalysis and Jujak's ideas of

16:53.440 --> 16:59.520
more cultural analysis, we seem to be in quite a dilemma, given the fact that, firstly,

17:00.320 --> 17:04.640
our super ego demands of living your best life can never be met, and the more you try,

17:04.640 --> 17:10.560
the guiltier you will feel. And secondly, the fact that you realize that your desire is not

17:10.560 --> 17:15.520
some authentic desire of you, of you wanting to live your best life is never what you truly want,

17:15.520 --> 17:21.360
but rather it's what society is telling you to want. We seem to be stuck in a rather catch-22.

17:21.360 --> 17:28.080
What do we do? What's the solution here? Now, the purpose of this video, like all my videos,

17:28.080 --> 17:32.960
is never to give any easy solutions, nor is it to ever, ever, absolutely not give advice,

17:32.960 --> 17:39.120
because what the hell do I know? But, at least to end the video on a high note and not in a kind

17:39.120 --> 17:46.480
of cynical, defeatist note, I could talk about a few things that Peter Rollins introduces to

17:46.480 --> 17:51.520
this conversation. He too was, in fact, influenced heavily by Lacan and Jujak, but his kind of

17:51.520 --> 17:57.600
theological understanding of what we can do, given that we, in many ways, need to try and

17:57.600 --> 18:03.280
liberate ourselves from this culture of self-help and productivity and living your best life.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.360
But before that, before talking about certain things we could do living amidst such a culture

18:07.360 --> 18:12.960
and such a social reality, there's a caveat, a very important caveat that I need to put forward,

18:13.600 --> 18:18.560
which is you cannot step outside of ideology. Now, I've spoken about ideology quite a lot in

18:18.560 --> 18:24.400
this video, and especially post-modern capitalist ideology. Now, we could all think the way the

18:24.400 --> 18:30.000
andrate people think, oh, that means now that I know all these things, I could just step outside

18:30.000 --> 18:38.480
of ideology and get red-pilled and wake up to the truth. This is to quote Lacan himself,

18:38.480 --> 18:43.600
le nom d'oeuvre air, which means those who are not d'oeuvre air most. To think that you can step

18:43.600 --> 18:49.520
out of ideology is the most ideological thing you could do. So, whenever someone tells you,

18:49.520 --> 18:54.320
here's the reality of our world, here's consumerism, here's all the problems we're facing,

18:55.760 --> 19:02.960
come to me, I'll give you the solution that is instantly ideology suspect, because the solution

19:02.960 --> 19:08.320
itself is a ideological reality, because we can never step outside of ideology. This is perhaps

19:08.320 --> 19:14.160
one of JJ's most original and perspicacious points that the only way to live in such a reality

19:14.160 --> 19:19.840
is to understand that ideology itself is our sociosymbolic reality that gives meaning to our

19:19.840 --> 19:26.640
lives. So, the only way to live in such a reality is to critique ideology from within,

19:26.640 --> 19:30.960
not to think that you can step outside of ideology and to make this argument a bit more

19:30.960 --> 19:38.000
metaphysical in the very famous Plato's Cave example. The idea is not that you could step

19:38.000 --> 19:43.600
outside of the cave and then see a reality, rather, reality itself presents itself to you

19:44.160 --> 19:48.720
through the cave, and the way you understand reality is through critique of ideology, in this

19:48.720 --> 19:53.200
case, critique of our social reality. So, with that caveat out of the way, here's one thing

19:53.200 --> 19:58.640
Peter Rowland suggests. It is the idea of grace. It's a very Christian concept, of course, and

19:59.440 --> 20:04.720
in such a culture, in such a culture of self-help, such a culture of obsession with living your

20:04.720 --> 20:12.480
best life. One thing we can struggle to do is, in fact, understand how grace works. Grace is a

20:13.120 --> 20:17.840
unearned love, and now you might think that, oh, unearned love, it's great, God's grace,

20:17.840 --> 20:22.560
it's fantastic, but no, it's not just saying there's some abstract God out there loving me,

20:22.560 --> 20:28.000
but rather learning in your social reality that you have the ability, the space, the freedom,

20:28.800 --> 20:35.040
whatever you may call it, to accept love, to accept love from your friends, from your family,

20:35.680 --> 20:44.400
and if you believe in God, from God himself, that it's okay to not fall into achievement society

20:44.400 --> 20:51.120
and just simply, and to use a very, very cliche term, be the stupid, dumb self you are,

20:51.920 --> 20:57.840
and still find love in this world. Find love in however way it may manifest, and this is, in fact,

20:58.000 --> 21:04.560
what the radical notion of grace is, because grace, Christian grace particularly, is unearned love,

21:04.560 --> 21:09.120
and you might think, oh, again, as I said before, that it's fine, I can enjoy unearned love, but no,

21:09.840 --> 21:17.440
keep in mind that in our post-modern society, with all the super ego imperatives of achieving,

21:17.440 --> 21:26.000
of doing the best, of getting to the top, of being your best self, receiving anything unearned

21:26.000 --> 21:31.040
is a traumatic, even traumatic experience. It is something we struggle a lot to feel

21:31.040 --> 21:36.640
loved in this world and to accept love, but if we learn, and that's really important, if we learn

21:36.640 --> 21:46.560
how to accept love and to accept grace, I believe to a certain extent, this can help us to live within

21:46.560 --> 21:52.960
such an ideological society with our current moral impositions and super ego imperatives.

21:53.680 --> 21:58.400
And the second thing is, as much as we learn to receive love, we also learn to give love,

21:58.400 --> 22:04.560
and to love others. Now, there are two ways I would put this. I could say, oh, of course,

22:04.560 --> 22:09.760
it comes in interpersonal relations, romantic love, loving your friends, loving your family,

22:09.760 --> 22:13.360
but I also think, and perhaps it is quite important, given as Aristotle said,

22:13.360 --> 22:18.160
we are political animals, and he meant that more in the sense that we are social animals in a

22:18.160 --> 22:23.360
social reality, not in this day to day silly, the spectacle of politics, they didn't mean that at

22:23.360 --> 22:30.080
all. Given that we are a part of society as much as society is out there, it's also within us,

22:30.640 --> 22:38.400
it's learning to understand that it's important to have a vocation, it's important to have an

22:38.400 --> 22:43.040
existential project in life, whatever it may be, you could be a writer, you could be a political

22:43.120 --> 22:49.680
activist, you could be a scientist, an engineer, an entrepreneur, whatever it may be, it has to be

22:49.680 --> 22:54.960
something that's an existential project, not something silly like a careerism or making money,

22:54.960 --> 22:59.440
not playing the rat race and falling into the game of capitalism, certainly not, but rather

22:59.440 --> 23:05.280
understanding that what you do in this world matters, not only to yourself, but also to others.

23:06.320 --> 23:12.240
And I think that in some sense, liberates us from this kind of narcissistic obsession to live your

23:12.240 --> 23:18.800
best life and to always sub-actualize. So yeah, that's at least for me what's helped me to understand

23:18.800 --> 23:23.760
that I don't have to live my best life, I could be the shitty stupid person I am, but at the same

23:23.760 --> 23:30.080
time, learn to love, learn to accept love, but also to find a vocation and to commit myself to that

23:30.080 --> 23:36.880
cause, to that vocation, and in fact to go all the way, not to live this kind of tepid life of

23:36.960 --> 23:42.240
oh, I've got to meditate five hours a day, have my cold shower, exercise, take all my vitamins and

23:42.240 --> 23:46.640
live this perfect, balanced, holistic life, none of that, none of that, to understand that

23:47.360 --> 23:54.400
existence itself has an antagonism and chaos to it, and that despite that, despite that chaos,

23:54.400 --> 24:02.080
or perhaps through it, I will learn to partake in my vocation, partake in my existential project,

24:02.080 --> 24:08.400
while also understanding that the ultimate guiding principle, the impetus behind all of it,

24:08.400 --> 24:15.360
is love, and that is why I would say Christian theology, the Christian idea of grace, certainly,

24:16.320 --> 24:21.840
I would say, is perhaps most important for our culture than any other culture,

24:21.840 --> 24:27.440
when I mean our culture, I mean neoliberal capitalist culture in the times we live in.
