00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hey everyone, so in the last couple of years I began to feel this sense of

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,300
cynicism and deep pessimism growing in our culture and I'd even say it started

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,080
coming into my personal and private life not at a philosophical abstract level

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,000
but really in my day-to-day intimate interactions and I started feeling that

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,040
viscerally and a part of me was like you got to give the devil his deal you know

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,800
I think you can't justify a certain level of cynicism in this world we live in

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,200
and that's what inspired this essay you know I write to think and for the

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,120
longest time I wrote for myself my private thoughts you know journaling

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,640
just taking down notes here and there and I think I finally mastered up the

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,320
confidence to start sharing my work publicly you know sharing my writing

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,840
publicly even though I tend to ramble a bit so I'm sort of plotting along and

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,480
trying to make sense of why I still think despite all the malevolence despite

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:13,640
all the cynicism that is that BCN is justified to a certain level that they

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,760
still a case to be made against it a case to be made for living life in the

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,880
fullest and deriving meaning out of the world we live in so anyway I hope you

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,680
enjoyed this essay it's actually a an essay I wrote for medium and my you know

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,400
personal blog and I'm just reading it out because I do know that a lot of people

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,840
prefer listening or watching it instead of reading it part of it is obviously

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,720
subjective and personal to me but then I also think most of it is really something

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,720
that's applicable to all of us that's like an objective truth let's say but

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,720
yeah I'm keen to hear your thoughts I hope you enjoy it let's get to it now

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,080
against cynicism my case for living life to the fullest

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,840
to my partners annoyance I have a running joke I make at social gatherings

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,560
about wanting to have 10 kids one day enough to play a 515 basketball game I

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,800
tell myself the reason behind the joke is for some engaging befuddling humor to

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,760
lighten up the mood in a room even though it mostly leaves me having to

27
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,600
explain the joke awkwardly and even then most people do not find it funny yet

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,640
the more I think about it I feel as if this is something my heart truly

29
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,240
desires to have many kids probably not 10 and become a father someday hopefully

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,880
a good one as the adage goes there's a grain of truth in every joke but then I

31
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,440
think why would I want to do something that absurdly impractical when evidence

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,760
suggests that as people get more educated they tend to have fewer children

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,320
why would I want to go against the tide leaving aside the ridiculous number of

34
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,760
kids why even bring a child into this God for second world scourged by climate

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:15,240
change pandemics a lamentable economy and alarming social unrest how selfish

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,520
and cruel of us to inflict such inevitable misery onto another human

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,560
being by bringing them into this world and even worse what if my posterity

38
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,920
becomes totalitarian and deceitful tyrants who end up exacerbating the

39
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,720
agony of people I've heard people say that loving a child is sacrificial and

40
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,960
such selfless love is the highest of all virtues utter nonsense one could argue

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,400
as it looks to me that most people willingly have children leaving aside

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,600
the accidents only to overcome the soul sucking banality of their life and don't

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,320
get me started on love sheer boredom drives us to find love it is a self

44
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,360
centered facade of intimacy even the unconditional love of God is conditional

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,280
as he necessitates for repentance prior to our salvation if God truly loved

46
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,960
his children why couldn't he just forgive us instead of sacrificing his own son

47
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,640
for atonement most people deceive themselves of being in love only when

48
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,120
it's passion and their absolute inability to live with themselves that

49
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,440
prepidatiously hold together their relationship it's why John Baptiste

50
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,600
Clemens recognized in Albert canons the fall of course true love is exceptional

51
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,400
two or three times a century more or less the rest of the time there's vanity

52
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,440
or boredom even if let's say love doesn't have to entail a higher virtue over

53
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:55,480
mere passion and all love necessitates is just that passion alone is in passion

54
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,240
itself a selfish pursuit supposed a man or woman audaciously follows their

55
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,560
dreams and aspirations in that case it seems like an awfully privileged

56
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,520
position handed to them by society and most people in the world wouldn't have

57
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,920
that fortune some may even say aspiration is for the spoil and ungrateful

58
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,240
desiring something more than being satisfied with the life they're given

59
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,600
as I've demonstrated above being cynical towards life isn't difficult but the

60
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,960
only question really worth asking is what to do after we've rationalized our

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,240
sense system that's what I try to deal with in this essay a caveat questioning

62
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,240
the answerable can leave us in a grim place the angst it brings makes us

63
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,440
bitter, misanthropic and implacable hence it's not surprising that we

64
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,160
intentionally repress these gratuitous thoughts and cling to what the rest of

65
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,240
society does with their lives the social zeitgeist protects us from insanity

66
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,040
it's more comforting to distract ourselves with a political or celebrity

67
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,240
scandal rather than looking into the festering wounds in our own lives and

68
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,960
reality itself at least for myself have it to I have been rather fortunate in my

69
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:23,120
life a lot of unearned good has come my way mostly through those I love and yet

70
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,040
these existential questions haunt me despite my good luck I have spent

71
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,040
countless nights trying to integrate my serendipity with the world's

72
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:43,080
unjust cruelty how dare I benefit from unmerited happiness it's not gratitude I

73
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,880
feel but a peculiar type of consternation at life I swear you gentlemen

74
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,520
that to be overly conscious is a sickness a real tarot sickness

75
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,720
Voidol Dostoevsky even while I'm writing this piece I question my

76
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,040
privilege and impertinence in asking such nonsensical questions about love

77
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:13,120
marriage and passion a part of myself is still yelling at me go do some work

78
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,840
hippie these aren't questions one should bother asking last year a friend of mine

79
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,360
unexpectedly passed away she was a beautiful soul her funeral was in

80
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,560
Sri Lanka and I couldn't attend it because I live in Australia but I saw her

81
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:40,080
wailing parents through the funeral livestream how cruel is the caprice of

82
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,240
life I thought and how arbitrary is the nature of suffering I particularly

83
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,720
remember her mom when I was growing up in Sri Lanka she was a loving and kind

84
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,960
lady what has she done to deserve such so crushing sorrow of losing a child how

85
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,160
could nature be so malignant my friend's death was a clear rebuttal of how life

86
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,760
ought to be as I was told parents aren't supposed to bury their children but it

87
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,720
ought to be the other way around I sit here in my comfortable apartment

88
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,360
typing and philosophizing away on my nifty computer wondering if I dug

89
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,320
myself into a hole too deep how privileged am I to dig this hole of my

90
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,560
own free will when my parents when my friend's parents were pushed into it by

91
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,520
the faded tragedy of life however privilege or misfortune angst or

92
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,960
gratitude aren't justifiable reasons to evade and hide from such questions we

93
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,000
shouldn't give way to the pretense and at times distractions of mundane life

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,960
that we all use to cushion ourselves from the existential blows of living nor

95
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,200
should we neolistically succumb to fatalistic resentment both these forms

96
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,840
of living are out of cowardice once a question is asked not as a mere

97
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:13,800
utterance but as an but as an authentic form of being itself and how we live

98
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,000
through our actions emotions words desires or whatever constitutes an

99
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,720
individual no reason we used to hide from such questions are adequate unless we

100
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,320
confront truth regardless of the consequences these questions will

101
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,520
enduringly haunt us forever every objection I brought up against children

102
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,640
or procreation marriage love passion and even gold salvation can be rebuked

103
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,360
through cogent arguments inferred from numerous intellectual propositions

104
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,720
and syllogisms a few ad hoc examples environmental activists Mike

105
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,960
Schellenberger makes a systematic case in his book apocalypse never as to why we

106
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,480
should be more optimistic about climate change and not capitulate to

107
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,600
anti-human sentiments such as not having children because of the environment

108
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,080
he emphasizes we should focus on humanitarian development and elevating

109
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,600
people from poverty as this has proven to be one of the best remedies for

110
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,760
imminent environmental problems the following tweet thread succinctly

111
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,360
highlights his worry about young people not wanting to have children due to

112
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,960
climate change I should stipulate that my intention behind using Schellenberger's

113
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,360
ideas as an example wasn't me taking a political stance on the matter of

114
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,080
climate change I stand neutral on the complicated subject as I'm grossly

115
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,280
uninformed about its nuances a big lie that pathologize society since the

116
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,040
1960s with the publication of books such as the population bomb is a myth of

117
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,360
dangerous overpopulation that lead to global famine and environmental

118
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,480
catastrophe up till now these radical claims seem unsubstantiated for

119
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,080
instance Lehman Stone from Vox states in his article why he shouldn't obsess

120
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,560
about overpopulation lowering US carbon intensity by about a third to around the

121
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,280
level of manufacturing superpower Germany today has a bigger effect than

122
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,400
preventing 100 million Americans from existing there's only one way to

123
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,240
effectively prevent alleviate or reverse dangerous climate change

124
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,960
technological geographic and social advancement population has little to do

125
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,200
with it especially not in the US despite the terrible consequences of COVID-19

126
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,200
we also made unprecedented progress in epidemiology and vaccination

127
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,880
development while I'm not reducing the suffering people went through due to the

128
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,400
pandemic modern medicines expedition is a scientific miracle we've seen in the

129
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,040
last few months UCLA health reports in a remarkable achievement of medical

130
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,480
science we've gone from identifying a new pathogen discovering an immune

131
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,200
response against it to developing and testing a safe and effective vaccine for

132
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,360
it in less than 12 months previously the fastest vaccination to go from

133
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,200
development to deployment was the mom's vaccine in the 1960s which took about four

134
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:38,000
years all these developments were obviously done by human beings therefore

135
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,080
using the pandemic as an example we could extrapolate the remedy to every other

136
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,280
problem we face including social unrest unfavorable economic conditions

137
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:55,120
environmental issues etc the answers lie in people the more talented people who

138
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,480
come to live the most solutions we will find through their skills looking through

139
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,320
a pure utilitarian ethical lens we need a bigger talent pool provided they have

140
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,800
equal opportunity to create more value in this world or crassly stating we need

141
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,400
more people to exploit more good from humanity for the world however pure

142
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,080
talent alone isn't what makes an individual remarkable it's a combination

143
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,400
of exceptional character and innate ability in their respective attitudes

144
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,720
therefore such excellence is rare and the only way to increase our plane of

145
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,920
serendipity is to increase the number of human beings the individual being a

146
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,680
central part of creation is an unbelievably ancient ideal it runs deep

147
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,200
into the mythology and stories that hold our cultures specifically the

148
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,280
Western world together the individual is the correct level of analysis as there

149
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,600
is a fundamental truth that speaks to a human beings sacredness and sublimity it

150
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,280
speaks so deeply that we couldn't even dare to question its validity for the

151
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,000
longest time in human history it would be considered sinful the book of Genesis

152
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,360
explicitly stating Imago day gold created man in his own image is a

153
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,320
proclamation of humanity being endowed by the divine to bring forth a new

154
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:30,200
reality into being the proposition of Imago day is a metaphysical problem that

155
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,520
philosophers are still trying to comprehend fully yet most modern

156
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,680
societies are undergirded by the concept of human rights which we invariably

157
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,360
cannot violate even the most obtruse and esoteric objections I put forward

158
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,880
earlier about gold salvation has been theologically dealt with by philosophers

159
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,760
such as William Lane Craig and Alvin Pantinger if you're interested in the

160
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,640
subject Dr. Craig recently wrote a whole book on the necessity for the death of

161
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,440
Christ for humanity's sins called atonement and the death of Christ and

162
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,040
exegetical historical and philosophical exploration additionally I could

163
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,160
recommend books like Enlightenment now by Stephen Pinker or the rational

164
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,720
optimist by Matt Ridley where both authors argue that humanity has made

165
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,400
unprecedented progress in the last few centuries they're confident we are on

166
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,600
the right track in almost every available measure for social and

167
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,160
environmental progress in the past two centuries providing ample evidence to

168
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:44,640
ascertain their findings from various research domains books such as these

169
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,160
delineate that we don't have to look any further for the miracle of human progress

170
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,880
and advancement than our own history notwithstanding the conspicuous

171
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,040
malvalence we see in humanity nevertheless none of these intellectual

172
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,600
arguments will satisfy the burdens of our souls at least it didn't do so for

173
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,400
mine I could find an infinite amount of philosophies from every domain of thought

174
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,840
known to human epistemology but still leave a persisting void of despair in

175
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,560
our hearts I know this to be certain as however much science and philosophy

176
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,680
intellectually stimulated me it was nothing compared to the most intimate

177
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,040
fulfillment that beauty valor and love brought to my soul life is in another

178
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,200
tried philosophical model instead the models are created in trying to

179
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,800
understand life itself we do not lead our lives by making a priori decisions

180
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,160
weighing the pros and cons similar to a machine learning model that runs on a

181
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,280
supervised set of rules for starters this would undeniably drive us insane and

182
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,800
most saliently at the least we do not even have a proper phenomenological

183
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,640
framework to deal with being we patently exist but this existence isn't the end

184
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,040
itself the question lies in what this existence for human beings entails the

185
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,600
telos could life be a set of propositional deductions masqueraded as

186
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,160
choices or is that too simplistic disregarding copious amounts of modern

187
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,360
scientific research research and a an ancient wisdom found across cultures for

188
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:41,000
a moment simple observation of regular life will show that seldom do we let

189
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:48,600
PO empiricism logic and cold rationalism guide our lives nor am I sure if we

190
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,400
should necessarily make rationalism the highest of human virtues contrary to

191
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,360
what the Enlightenment think is proclaimed life can be more accurately

192
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,240
portrayed through inspiration romance intuition serendipity synchronicity and

193
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,280
all those bewildering elements of reality that would be dismissed as

194
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:16,200
superfluous occultism by modernists none of these metaphysical or spiritual

195
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,880
phenomena that still are meaningful occurrences can be explained through the

196
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,360
modern scientific method and rationalism to make sense of those transcendent

197
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:34,840
realities we need the arts we need to revivify our fading appreciation for

198
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,920
aesthetics as Oscar Wilde wrote paradox though it may seem and paradoxes are

199
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:47,280
always dangerous things it is nonetheless true that life imitates art far more

200
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,560
than art imitates life for example to elucidate my point I could use a grim

201
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,200
philosophy called antinatalism utilizing the work of its leading advocate in

202
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,760
contemporary times David Beneter the antinatalist position is that humans

203
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,800
should stain from procreation because it's morally wrong to bring more

204
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,840
children to this world and what if and it would have been better for us to never

205
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,640
have been born in the first place

206
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,960
professor Beneter asserts the following presuppositional asymmetry between

207
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,440
pleasure and pain which the whole philosophy rests on number one the

208
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,960
presence of pain is bad number two the presence of pleasure is good number three

209
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,300
the absence of pain is good even if that pain is not enjoyed by anyone number

210
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,800
four the absence of pleasure is not bad unless they somebody for whom this

211
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:53,320
absence is a deprivation therefore if human beings cease to exist it still

212
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,880
fulfills point number three and four theoretically miss a really David

213
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,440
Beneter may seem like an evil person is evidently anti-human ideas could be the

214
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,440
same worldviews that motivated nihilistic school shooters and ruthless tyrants

215
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,480
publicly unveiling the human hearts innate malevolence I remember my

216
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,880
emotional reaction to coming across his work how in the world could Oxford

217
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,960
University Press even publish such a reprehensible book yet as I delve into

218
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,360
his work and the individual behind those ideas I discovered a person who isn't

219
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,600
much worse than the rest of us fools he did not have an irrational hatred for

220
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,480
humanity and he certainly wasn't stating that people currently living should be

221
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,280
wiped off the face of the planet in fastical irony he dedicated his book

222
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,560
better never to have been to his progenitor stating to my parents even

223
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,960
though they brought me into existence Beneter is simply an academic

224
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,760
philosopher putting forward a set of ideas similar to what socrates all

225
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,640
the stoics have done historically his assertion isn't particularly novel

226
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,520
either it's something human beings always wondered through a discussion that

227
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,320
goes all the way to the book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament and

228
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,000
I declared that the dead who had already died are happier than the living who are

229
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,320
still alive but better than both is the one who has never been born who has not

230
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,840
seen the evil that is under the sun I'm not a philosopher nor do I care for the

231
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,560
sort of generative philosophy that acts only in the plane of abstractions there's

232
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,920
nothing more convenient than creating asymmetries and inferring conclusions

233
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:55,560
within a finite set of ad hoc rules where we define the axioms I've lazily done

234
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,000
that even in parts of this essay it's what Albert Camel understood in the

235
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,280
myth of Sisyphus which in my opinion makes him a true and rare philosopher

236
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,120
there is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is

237
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,560
suicide judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering

238
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:23,000
the fundamental question of philosophy all the rest whether or not the world

239
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,840
has three dimensions whether the mind has nine or twelve categories comes

240
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,840
afterwards these are games one must first answer and if it is true as nature

241
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,240
claims that a philosopher to deserve our respect must preach by example you can

242
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,360
appreciate the importance of that reply for it will proceed the definitive act

243
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:52,800
these are facts the heart can feel yet they call for careful study before they

244
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:59,040
can become clear to the intellect was Mike Tyson crassly said everybody has a

245
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,600
plan until they get punched in the mouth

246
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,000
nevertheless despite my objections to conceptualizing life as a philosophical

247
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,920
model and prescribing eschatological judgments on living I will engage in

248
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:18,200
bentis example for expediency's sake but I will not engage as a philosopher as I

249
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,720
don't think the age-old question that was asked in Hamlet Solakway is a

250
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,560
philosophical one to be or not to be that is the question the fundamental

251
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,600
axiom in asymmetry between pain and pleasure presupposes one that the

252
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,480
presence of pain is bad and to the presence of pleasure is good I disagree

253
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,520
with this presupposition it isn't clear that life can be good only if its pain

254
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,960
is entirely eliminated from being and all and all human beings had was

255
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,000
infinite bliss and pleasure nor does it seem like as Dostoevsky understood

256
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,080
human beings will desire such a mode of living one of my childhood heroes was

257
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,960
Lakshman Kadergama okay a Sri Lankan statesman and a lawyer during his time

258
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,200
as the Minister of Foreign Affairs he was a key figure in Sri Lanka civil war

259
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,080
against the LTE a separatist service organization for example the independent

260
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,000
reported on his vitality for global politics Kadergama was not just any

261
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,880
senior minister he was the highest ranking ethnic Tamil in the government

262
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,400
more than that he was the man who was responsible more than anyone for drying

263
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,760
up international support for the Tamil Tigers the LTE it was his

264
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,840
international campaign that has a tiger's name as a banned terrorist

265
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:57,400
organization in the US UK and other countries similar to similar awards in

266
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,680
any other country Sri Lanka's conflict has a nuanced and complicated history and

267
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:10,600
yet most Sri Lankans would unequivocally agree LK was a national hero he was

268
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:16,240
posthumously awarded the highest national honor Sri Lanka Bhimanya a title

269
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,600
shared by Sir Atsi Clark in hindsight I believe my father giving me LK's

270
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,760
biography to read was the impetus behind my interest in studying politics ethics

271
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:36,040
and philosophy outstanding his profuse security and protection on August 12th

272
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:44,200
2005 LK was assassinated by an LTE sniper in LK's biography his son Raghi

273
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,000
states when he was assassinated it was of course not a complete surprise part of

274
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,120
me had been expecting it for years his daughter Ajita concludes perhaps fate

275
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,560
intervened on the night of August 12th but chance he allowed it to in the

276
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:11,240
knowledge that his every move was being watched in the final analysis it is

277
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:17,800
possible that Lakshman Kaduragama shows to meet his death that night as a sniper

278
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,720
sat there trigger ready target in sight

279
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Lakshman Kaduragama's life was a quintessential hero's journey in a way

280
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,560
he plays an archetypal role in my mind a true patriot that lived a life of

281
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:45,600
nobility who wrote in a friend's autograph book at the age of 14 how

282
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,760
sweet and honorable is it to die for one's country and still his biography

283
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,680
doesn't depict a life of bliss and pleasure without any pain instead a

284
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:05,080
life of angst grief strife and the tremendous weight of carrying the

285
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,840
burden of a bloody and ruthless ethnic conflict according to David Bennett's

286
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:18,280
hypothesis LK's life would be a bad one due to due to its inherent pain but most

287
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,440
people would agree that he'll be good life it'll be philosophically laborious or

288
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,880
probably impossible to reason and delineate this good but the purpose

289
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,200
Lakshman Kaduragama lived for transcended all of his pain for the more

290
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,560
his noble being created more overall good for the world stories like LK's

291
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:47,600
remind me that hypothetical philosophical models will never explain life and

292
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,920
reality we cannot create arbitrary axioms of good and bad to justify a living

293
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,840
it's impossible ever to know all the consequences of living both good and

294
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:05,160
bad intended or unintended besides how dare I adjudicate if a potential future

295
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:13,360
person was to be born after a 30 year old war that took over 100,000 lives what

296
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,240
would it be Trilanka's fate if Lakshman Kaduragama never came into being an

297
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:26,840
answerable yet deeply moving question it's this impenetrable enigma and

298
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:33,040
sublime inexplicability of life that mandates are so lived as we'll never

299
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:39,000
know if life's worth living until we have all together and entirely lived it as

300
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,160
one of Soran Kedricar's journals say it is really true what philosophy tells us

301
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,760
that life must be understood backwards but with this one forgets the second

302
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:57,040
proposition that it must be lived forwards a proposition which the more it

303
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:03,000
is subjected to careful thought the more it ends up concluding precisely that

304
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,120
life at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood exactly

305
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,800
exactly because there is no single moment where time stops completely in

306
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:23,240
order for me to take the position to do this going backwards often shortened to

307
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:29,360
life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards I'm a

308
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,800
software engineer and a few weeks ago I was having dinner at a steakhouse with

309
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,800
one of my collegial engineers we had a fascinating conversation that led us all

310
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,680
the way from discussing Roger Penrose's hypothesis on consciousness to me asking

311
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:50,760
him mate if I may ask what does love mean to you he

312
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:57,440
unhesitantly replied love gives me a reason for eternity I thought deeply

313
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,200
about this response only love has the metamorphosing ability to turn an

314
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,160
engineer who typically works in the technical realm of logic and cold

315
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:16,000
abstractions into a port and produce such beautiful statement my fortune to

316
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,960
fall in love with Shannon the most remarkable woman who if my luck prevails

317
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,320
I hope to marry someday has convinced me that love is the most irrational

318
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:33,800
chaotic and incomprehensible force of being that captivates our life like no

319
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:40,040
other many have tried but no port or philosopher could ever accurately

320
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:46,960
portray what love means to a human being I think this may be why the phrase goes

321
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,800
I fell in love not I willed my way into love none of us plan to fall in love it

322
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:01,960
just happens love is unplanned yet timeless unbidden it's yet yearnful

323
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,680
obtruse yet tangible so real yet meaningful and ultimately we find a

324
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:14,720
reason to live because of love alone this is why I think even Fitzwilliam

325
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,360
Darcy had to go again societal standards and his own prejudice judgment as love

326
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,880
drove him to profess his feelings towards Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and

327
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,680
Prejudice in vain have I struggled it will not do my feelings will not be

328
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:38,920
repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you

329
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:44,280
however even if love alone gives a reason to live this life still worth

330
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:50,360
living to the fullest even if the emotions evoked in us by love are good

331
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,480
and absolutely real does love justify doing anything that benefits oneself

332
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,080
like following one's passion marriage or having children firstly unless someone

333
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,800
can prove otherwise doing things that are beneficial and good for ourselves

334
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,160
isn't inherently selfish immoral or unjustifiable due to Eastern

335
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,880
philosophies influence with ideas like impermanence or non-self accentuated by

336
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:24,640
rampant materialism secularism and growing radical self-criticism within

337
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:32,040
Western culture Westerners have begun to feel guilty for their own being with the

338
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,200
loss of religion and consequently spirituality being jettisoned from the

339
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,960
cultural ethos Westerners feel their individual lives are a waste of space

340
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,760
on this planet or maybe even a pest brutally exploiting Gaia benevolent

341
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,840
mother nature dr. Carl you in all his brilliance and wisdom understood the

342
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,040
death of spirituality in 1957 and prophetically warned us of the ominous

343
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:08,280
signs in his essay the undiscovered self just as man as a social being cannot in

344
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:14,120
the long run exist without a tie to the community so the individual will never

345
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,400
find the real justification for his existence and his own spiritual and

346
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:26,800
moral autonomy anywhere except in an extra mundane principle capable of

347
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:33,600
relativizing the overpowering influence of external factors the individual who

348
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,760
is not anchored in God can offer no resistance on his own resources to the

349
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:46,040
physical and moral blandishments of the world for this he needs the evidence of

350
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,000
inner transcendent experience which alone can protect him from the otherwise

351
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,400
inevitable submersion in the mass therefore with such negation of the

352
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:05,640
individual self any act not serving the greater good but one self is looked

353
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:11,360
down upon by contemporary culture but we must ignore scornful societal

354
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,400
condescension and judgment as such nihilistic pessimism is futile and

355
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,880
serves no purpose but only breeds resentment suppose something we find

356
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:27,160
meaningful is good for us and this minimal harm nothing is entirely innocuous

357
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:34,440
to society in that case there's no good reason to not do that thing undertaking

358
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,280
such responsibility may even be a divine duty notwithstanding our

359
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:46,640
consciousness of our own shortcomings and unworthiness secondly a bizarre

360
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:52,280
realization we eventually come to have about life is that doing things not for

361
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,640
ostensible virtue but genuine goodness that gives us a real sense of meaning

362
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,880
mutual mutually benefits both society and ourselves getting married to a person

363
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,480
we love begins a family one of society's most foundational and imperative

364
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,840
units for it to function even if it were for entirely selfish reasons we

365
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:20,280
decide to have a child let's say as a remedy for trisinarian odum this act

366
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,960
results in bringing forth a new life and every human being is the epicenter of

367
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,480
untapped potential and creation embarking on an entrepreneurial artistic or

368
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,000
sporting venture merely to live out one's passion creates unforeseeable

369
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,240
value in society and hopefully if done portfully even benefits the planet

370
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:49,920
symbiotically not just in the cliche capitalist tenor of transactional value

371
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,920
creation but even through those heavenly aspects of life that cannot be

372
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,760
commoditized i.e. inspiration beauty elegance awe and wonder all of this

373
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,160
goodness comes into being despite the inherent suffering and malevolence

374
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:11,960
inexorably present in life however if we cannot see the divine ethos in this

375
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:17,760
paradoxical miracle of being alive then nothing could stand up to our nihilistic

376
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,520
and cruel judgment but what if we peel the onion one more layer why be good

377
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:30,320
why not wreck havoc in society and burn it all to the ground it certainly

378
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,920
creates circular reasoning to assert what must be good for the sake of

379
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,040
goodness fortunately for reasons I can't fathom Abrahamic religions have a

380
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,680
straightforward answer to this dilemma and I'm yet to find a better

381
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,440
explanation or a more truthful narrative than this ancient story as it's an

382
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,960
ultimate divine calling from God beginning with the Old Testament we are

383
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:04,000
told so God created mankind in his own image and the image of God he created

384
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,680
them male and female he created them Genesis 127 straddling to the cumulative

385
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,560
commandment by Jesus of Nazareth in the Gospels thou shall love thy neighbor as

386
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:25,120
thyself as many philosophers like Sartor and Dostoevsky understood there's no

387
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,840
God all is permitted the central stipulation of this viewpoint is

388
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,200
without a tangible moral absolute God specifically the monotheistic God

389
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,960
humanity is left in a moral miasma of ethical oblivion and a volatile values

390
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,480
framework it would be like trying to do theoretical physics without mathematics

391
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:56,960
William Lane Craig recents accordingly in his apologetics book on God to say

392
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,440
that the Holocaust was objectively raw is to say that the Holocaust was raw

393
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,320
even though the Nazis who carried it out thought that it was right and and it

394
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,520
would still have been wrong even if the Nazis had won World War two and succeeded

395
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,880
in brainwashing or exterminating everybody who disagreed with them so that

396
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,480
everyone in the world thought that the Holocaust was right and good to say that

397
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,880
the Holocaust was objectively raw means that it's wrong regardless of the

398
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,440
outcomes of World War two the premise is that if there's no God then moral

399
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,320
values or duties are not objective in that sense and yet my unreasonable and

400
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,280
rebellious heart is still unfulfilled I don't think human divinity can be

401
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,720
reduced to a sentence, catchphrase, proposition, philosophical stipulation,

402
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,720
commandment or law. Tenets could be extrapolated from our understanding of

403
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,320
divinity for pragmatic or applicative sake i.e. Ten Commandments, Magna Carta,

404
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,520
Universal Declaration of Human Rights but instances of divinity don't encompass

405
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:15,040
all of its truth they only allude to its actuality our limited cognition knowledge

406
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,560
and language gategoal and human divinity the moment it's instantiated for

407
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:27,760
comprehension the ultimate catch-22 a celestial provocation that's making our

408
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,880
predicament rather comical it's this absurdity of living that makes life both

409
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:40,320
a tragedy and comedy I see this quandary unfold in my life every day from the

410
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,600
moment I wake up in the morning sometimes I'm an atheistic relativist and

411
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,120
other times I'm a spiritual being piously carrying out my divine duty it's

412
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,040
not that I don't see the logical contradiction in this way of living I

413
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,960
perfectly understand my folly but it's the most accurate way I can portray my

414
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,720
dilemma and I know I'm not the only one maybe human beings created philosophy to

415
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,960
deal with this spontaneous morality driven mainly by emotions that emerge in

416
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,920
life we need coherent providence for cosmic forlorness from a cold and

417
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,120
indifferent universe nevertheless our salvation does not lie in a simple

418
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:30,400
postulation i.e. I'm a Christian Muslim or Jew I'm a Buddhist or Hindu I'm an

419
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:37,080
atheist or skeptic etc we are too mercurial to be herald by mere label

420
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,120
I'll observe myself being bizarre by ruining a perfectly good week by doing

421
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:49,480
something that I hate which makes me miserable and self-loathing the label

422
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,760
I used to define my identity is unavailing and meaningless during these

423
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:02,680
times so I ask knowing exactly what or what not to do why does my it define my

424
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,680
conscience do otherwise it is naive to think we base our lives on a philosophical

425
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:15,040
proposition or some arbitrary religious or non-religious label ask yourself how

426
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,840
often do you do things you hate contemporary psychology may call this

427
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,600
self-destructive behavior but identifying its reality doesn't answer the

428
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:31,120
fundamental question why do human beings act out in this peculiar and

429
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:37,240
nonsensical way when we observe our lives in retrospect it seems clear that

430
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,800
rationality explains very little about our condition I'm yet to find a

431
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,680
quintessential rationalist even in my highly technical field of computer

432
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,120
science where people mainly deal with logical abstractions people remain true

433
00:41:54,120 --> 00:42:00,040
to their nature I think this is why it's poignant to see modern society reduce

434
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,800
the human experience to pragmatic utilitarianism and carelessly disregard

435
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,760
any sense of the sublime therefore given that life resembles more a symphony or

436
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,040
story over an a priori culturalistic mechanism how do we deal with this

437
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:21,280
existential volatility at least for now I've concluded what's ultimately left

438
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,400
for us to do is to take a Kierkegaardian leap of faith according to the Sanford

439
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,920
Encyclopedia of Philosophy for Kierkegaard Christian faith is not a

440
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,800
matter of regurgitating church dogma it is a matter of individual subjective

441
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:44,480
passion which cannot be mediated by the clergy or by human artifacts faith is the

442
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,520
most important task to be achieved by a human being because only on the basis of

443
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,400
faith does an individual have a chance to become a true self this self is a

444
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:03,040
lifework which God judges for eternity it has taken me years to understand what

445
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,840
faith meant to human beings reading Kierkegaard at least shed some light on

446
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:14,920
the matter he uses Abraham from the book of Genesis and the modifical night of

447
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:21,360
faith in his book fear and trembling to expound how he viewed faith people are

448
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,480
unable to bear the martyrdom unintelligently jump off the pile and

449
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,720
choose instead conveniently enough the world's admiration of their proficiency

450
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,240
the true night of faith is a witness never a teacher and in this lies the

451
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,560
deep humanity in him which is more word than this foolish concern for others

452
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:49,200
wheel and wall which is honored under the name of sympathy but which is

453
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,240
really nothing but vanity the true night of faith is always absolute

454
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:02,440
isolation the false night is sectarian this sectarianism is an attempt to leap

455
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,240
away from the narrow path of the paradox and become a tragic hero at a cheap

456
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:15,440
price the tragic hero expresses universal and sacrifices himself for it the

457
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,600
sectarian punch in yellow instead of that has a private theater i.e. several

458
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,800
good friends and comrades who represent the universal just about as well as the

459
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,440
Beatles in the golden snuff box represents justice the individual of faith on

460
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,440
the contrary is the paradox is the individual absolutely nothing but the

461
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,280
individual without connections or pretensions this is the terrible thing

462
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,120
which a sectarian mannequin can't endure for instead of learning from this

463
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,560
terror that he's not capable of performing the great deed and then

464
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:58,080
plainly admitting it an act which I cannot but approve because it is what I

465
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:03,960
do the mannequin thinks that by uniting with several other mannequins he will be

466
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,920
able to do it but that is quite out of the question in the world of spirit no

467
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:15,480
swindling is tolerated the narrow passage to gold is a lonely journey it has to be

468
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,360
or else our faith is mine you can only have faith in our individual pilgrimage

469
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,520
and gold when I first came across as philosophy I became depressed I only

470
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,240
used to term dramatically as an extra word that likes community and enjoys a

471
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:37,000
good conversation preferably over a fine steak and some whiskey I remember

472
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
thinking why does arguably the most important journey of our life the one

473
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,760
to God have to be a lonely endeavor but then I understood living in faith is a

474
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,600
state of being be embodied regardless of our public proclamations it is the only

475
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,560
real identity we incarnate that's unconditionally of our own will because

476
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:05,600
every other identity gender race sexuality class etc is

477
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:12,160
inescapably feted by society culture biology and the objective world there's

478
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,720
only a subjective spiritual journey that transcends every other material identity

479
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:24,080
given to us by simply being alive therefore refusing to accept our

480
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,080
divide divine adventures loneliness and trying to find it through social

481
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:34,480
institutions or the predominant cultural zeitgeist of our times with only

482
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:40,480
corrupt its essence and exacerbate our understandable nihilistic cynicism however

483
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,160
we must not misunderstand this journey to be a despondent one around the end of

484
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,840
2017 I experienced a somewhat miracle in life despite all my inadequate season

485
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:59,600
flaws I made a conscious choice to embody faith I started not to see the

486
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:06,320
transcendent as a distant deistic reality but rather to see divinity in

487
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:11,560
mundane life or the Christian parlance treat everyone as God's children and

488
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:18,800
everything as God's creation I learned that living on faith took courage most

489
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,680
people think it takes courage to face death it doesn't that is inevitable

490
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:30,120
what requires true courage is the will to live I still face the same trials and

491
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:35,760
tribulations of life I did in 2017 albeit I found love in 2018 and that's

492
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:43,280
redemptive to one soul but my choice my lonely leap of faith miraculously rid me

493
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,320
of nihilistic cynicism notwithstanding the malevolence and suffering in being

494
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:57,320
recognized every day I doubt I can argue against anti-natalism David

495
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:02,080
Bennett has the verbal virtuosity and it an intellectual prowess that I don't

496
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:09,320
even remotely possess and yet I know the best case I can make against

497
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:15,080
anti-natalism is by how I live the faith I choose to embody is the antidote to

498
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,240
cynicism it's at least the best I can do

499
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,840
cynicism is the worst form of existence it doesn't help anybody nor is it a

500
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,640
remedy to anything it's neither pragmatic nor does it answer the deepest

501
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,000
grievances in the human heart a cynic doesn't want to live nor die but only

502
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,560
being a state of resentful non-existence a supercilious refusal to partake in

503
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:51,600
life being cynical is just cowardly a piece of animus an unheroic reaction to

504
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:58,480
life yes a lot can and probably will go wrong our passions could be fruitless

505
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,360
and lame every venture we start could end up in failure and possible and

506
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,480
possible ruin friends will disappoint us

507
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,120
unapologetically marriage could end in a better divorce our children might hate

508
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:18,920
us for a pathetic ineptness as parents love could break our heart we will

509
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,520
witness unjust suffering and we may even be partly responsible for us for its

510
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:31,520
subsistence during these lamentable moments helpless helplessness will

511
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,880
haunt our souls culture will turn eyes us and society will negate our

512
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:43,360
individuality nature will try to wipe us out of existence and there will be times

513
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:49,520
where we feel abandoned and alienated from a cold and dark universe apathetic

514
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:57,400
and indifferent to our feelings but somehow in spite of everything I said

515
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:03,280
it about living by faith vindicates all the ghastly anxiety-evoking horrors of

516
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,960
being I can only extrapolate from my journey in the last few years as that's

517
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:16,200
the only worthy story I can tell I found that faith allows the objective and

518
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:21,320
subjective to touch by revealing a phenomenological coherence to the

519
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:26,800
faithful it shows symphony in life and the drama that unfolds as we paradoxically

520
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:34,480
take part in it as both an audience and cast member faith shows how every

521
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:40,720
instance of being is meaningful both subjective and objectively faith is the

522
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,720
handmade enough love so we're left with no recalls but to embody faith

523
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:51,240
undergirded by relentless courage in every moment of life we should not think

524
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:56,520
of it as a another distant and anachronistic religious ritual being

525
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:02,280
faithful is an act of bravery for what it's worth I can sincerely say that I

526
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,840
try to consciously exercise faith in every aspect of my life career

527
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,680
relationships family how I treat strangers and even software engineering

528
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:17,880
I've learned its paramount nature has to be the reason religion is primarily

529
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,920
revealed to us through faith as it amalgamates reality like no other

530
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:28,160
I've humbled myself to this truth it's what Kerkakar understood about the

531
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:36,040
crucifixion of Jesus as he writes in the sickness unto death the opposite of sin

532
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:40,560
is not virtue but faith
