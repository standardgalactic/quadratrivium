WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
And that really, this is the question

00:01.720 --> 00:04.880
that I want to start off with at a high level.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.600
The reason being, I've realized if anyone's

00:07.600 --> 00:10.600
going to ask for me from now onwards,

00:10.600 --> 00:12.040
what is philosophy of science?

00:12.040 --> 00:14.360
Or can I have a bit of a brief introduction?

00:14.360 --> 00:16.960
I just tell them to read chapter one of the Knowledge

00:16.960 --> 00:19.760
Machine, because one of my favorite chapters

00:19.760 --> 00:24.160
where you go through the history of, well, really,

00:24.160 --> 00:29.760
20th century science, and this great method debate.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.080
So I'd love for you to, Michael,

00:31.080 --> 00:34.480
maybe like expand and lay down.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.240
We've probably done this many times in previous broadcasts,

00:37.240 --> 00:40.280
so I apologize if I got to repeat yourself.

00:40.280 --> 00:45.480
The debate between Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn

00:45.480 --> 00:49.400
and what's this ongoing great method debate

00:49.400 --> 00:51.800
in the philosophy of science.

00:51.800 --> 00:57.000
You know, I think it all began when a lot of intellectuals

00:57.000 --> 01:00.200
in the 20th century were looking at the mess

01:00.200 --> 01:07.840
that the human race had made of, or at least the kind of the

01:07.840 --> 01:11.360
European part of the human race had made of the world.

01:11.360 --> 01:14.920
And this is actually particularly

01:14.920 --> 01:19.160
after the First World War, that's why I'm emphasizing Europe.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.480
And decided that what they need to do

01:21.480 --> 01:25.600
is to rebuild everything on rational principles.

01:25.600 --> 01:30.400
And at that time, that really meant scientific principles

01:30.400 --> 01:31.320
for them.

01:31.320 --> 01:36.080
And so this question came out, what are scientific principles?

01:36.080 --> 01:39.080
What is it to go about, for example,

01:39.080 --> 01:41.520
constituting a state scientifically

01:41.520 --> 01:44.440
or drawing up a moral code scientifically?

01:44.440 --> 01:46.520
And those are deep, complicated questions

01:46.520 --> 01:50.680
that I don't have answers to and I wasn't writing about in my book.

01:50.680 --> 01:55.040
But of course, it turned all of these philosophers

01:55.040 --> 01:56.200
into philosophers of science.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.280
They had to say, here is the right way

01:59.280 --> 02:01.640
to go about gaining knowledge, the scientific way,

02:01.640 --> 02:02.840
as opposed to the other way.

02:02.840 --> 02:06.520
So they wanted to be able to write down, in effect,

02:06.520 --> 02:11.040
some rules for inquiry, not necessarily

02:11.040 --> 02:13.760
a complete guide to inquiry, but some kind of set of rules

02:13.760 --> 02:17.320
that was distinctive enough to separate science

02:17.320 --> 02:18.200
from all the rest.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.680
And what I call the great method debate

02:20.680 --> 02:23.320
begins there with the attempt to say

02:23.320 --> 02:28.720
what the scientific method is in a way that differentiates it

02:28.720 --> 02:32.040
from all other forms of inquiry.

02:32.040 --> 02:36.240
And after the early difficulties in doing that,

02:36.240 --> 02:38.800
that turned into a big debate about whether there even

02:38.800 --> 02:40.480
was a scientific method.

02:40.480 --> 02:45.040
And you can see one way to look at Papa's and Coon's work

02:45.040 --> 02:47.920
is this, that Papa was someone who thought he knew

02:47.920 --> 02:49.200
what the scientific method was.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.440
And he is a paradigm of one of these thinkers

02:51.440 --> 02:55.680
who wanted to make the world scientific.

02:55.680 --> 02:58.360
And he did write on politics as much as he did on science.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.240
But anyway, so he's someone who believes

03:00.240 --> 03:02.640
there's a scientific method, and he can tell you what it is,

03:02.640 --> 03:06.600
and that the right sort of critical rational scientific mind

03:06.600 --> 03:08.960
is the one that applies this method.

03:08.960 --> 03:12.680
Probably more than anyone else in the history of,

03:12.680 --> 03:15.280
at least in the history of 20th century philosophy

03:15.280 --> 03:18.000
of science, Thomas Coon is identified

03:18.000 --> 03:20.960
as someone who undercut Papa's project.

03:20.960 --> 03:25.520
But Coon is not a negative philosophy.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.440
He has his own actually quite sophisticated story

03:28.440 --> 03:29.680
about how science works.

03:29.680 --> 03:35.120
But it's really deeply different from the standard method

03:35.120 --> 03:35.620
story.

03:35.620 --> 03:38.320
And in fact, it's a story in which

03:38.320 --> 03:39.880
scientists don't come out looking

03:39.880 --> 03:42.520
like these kind of critical rationalists,

03:42.520 --> 03:44.160
but something rather different.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.640
And of course, we can talk a little bit more

03:46.640 --> 03:49.080
about that in a moment, but rather than diving into it,

03:49.080 --> 03:50.840
I just really want to stress this contrast

03:50.840 --> 03:53.800
between, on the one hand, this single scientific method

03:53.800 --> 03:58.000
that's the epitome of critical inquiry with Papa.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.800
And then with Coon, you have there's

03:59.800 --> 04:02.760
a distinctive social organization in science.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.840
But it actually involves many different methods

04:05.840 --> 04:09.040
at different times, so there's not one unchanging method.

04:09.040 --> 04:14.120
And furthermore, that setup is almost, you might say,

04:14.120 --> 04:16.600
well, if not irrationalist, then there's

04:16.600 --> 04:21.520
many elements to it that seem quite at odds with Papa's

04:21.520 --> 04:24.080
very heroic view of scientific inquiry

04:24.080 --> 04:28.920
as I say, the apex of rationality.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.320
Yeah, I mean, after all, Papa was also

04:31.320 --> 04:33.040
a political philosopher, right?

04:33.040 --> 04:35.760
I mean, I've read his book, The Open Society,

04:35.760 --> 04:39.440
and it's enemies of, anyway, the book on totalitarianism.

04:39.440 --> 04:43.120
And he even calls Plato the person who

04:43.120 --> 04:46.120
started all of totalitarianism.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.520
It's quite interesting.

04:48.520 --> 04:52.840
So Professor Streamins, if you could start with Papa,

04:52.840 --> 04:56.000
and then, of course, the unfortifiability principle.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.080
Now, anyone could, I don't think it's that hard,

04:58.080 --> 04:59.920
even for a layperson like myself,

04:59.920 --> 05:02.360
to just Google what it means and get

05:02.360 --> 05:04.280
a very elementary understanding.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.320
So perhaps you could firstly just explain

05:06.320 --> 05:11.880
what the Karl Popperian unfortifiability principle is.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.920
But then also, as you've done in the book, rather well,

05:15.960 --> 05:17.960
maybe lay down some of your criticisms,

05:17.960 --> 05:21.880
criticisms of it just for the audience.

05:21.880 --> 05:22.640
Yeah, sure.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.920
So Papa thought that really the heart of the scientific method

05:25.920 --> 05:29.480
was this very simple idea that if a theory makes

05:29.480 --> 05:33.440
a false prediction, it has to be wrong somehow.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.760
And Papa thought that at the core of the scientific inquiry

05:37.760 --> 05:41.760
was the systematic elimination of all of the false theories.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.640
And notionally, of course, you could imagine one day

05:44.640 --> 05:46.360
having eliminated them all and just having

05:46.360 --> 05:49.560
one true theory remaining, although as Papa

05:49.560 --> 05:52.440
was understood as well as anyone,

05:52.440 --> 05:55.160
that was not a realistic prospect.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.720
But he thought we could at least think of ourselves

05:56.720 --> 05:59.960
as making progress by eliminating the false theories.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.200
So the thing that makes that, oh, go ahead.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.880
No, I was just going to ask, please continue.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.280
I'm not going to follow up on that, but keep going, yeah.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.440
OK, so the thing that makes that, though,

06:08.440 --> 06:12.280
now turning to where he begins to run into difficulties.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.600
And he had plenty of things to say about these difficulties,

06:15.600 --> 06:19.680
not as if this is some sort of one-shot undermining

06:19.680 --> 06:20.200
in his view.

06:20.200 --> 06:25.320
But it's really difficult when a theory does

06:25.320 --> 06:26.920
make a false prediction to figure out

06:26.920 --> 06:29.920
whether it was really the theory's fault or not.

06:29.920 --> 06:32.840
Science is such a complicated thing.

06:32.840 --> 06:37.160
And in particular, the kinds of measurement apparatus

06:37.160 --> 06:40.840
that are used to make observations in cutting-edge science

06:40.840 --> 06:44.760
are often very complicated, fragile things that only

06:44.760 --> 06:48.760
work when conditions are exactly right.

06:48.760 --> 06:52.560
99.9% of the time, when you get a false prediction,

06:52.560 --> 06:54.520
it's not really the theory's fault at all.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.560
It's just that something went wrong with apparatus.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.800
Or maybe you made a false assumption

06:58.800 --> 07:00.520
when you were making your calculations.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.240
Or maybe even, and this does happen,

07:03.240 --> 07:05.040
there's an error in the software that you're

07:05.040 --> 07:06.640
using to analyze your results.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.560
And so it's not really the theory's fault or not,

07:08.560 --> 07:11.080
and it would be a terrible mistake to throw away the theory

07:11.080 --> 07:13.720
just because you got this false prediction.

07:13.720 --> 07:18.760
So if you're going to capture the spirit of Papa's proposal,

07:18.760 --> 07:24.240
you have to figure out some way of deciding when it's OK

07:24.240 --> 07:26.880
to just say, oh, something went wrong with the apparatus.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.760
And when you should say, Arno, this time it's the theory's fault.

07:30.760 --> 07:33.080
And so we've falsified the theory, as he says.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.880
We can throw away the theory.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.280
Sometimes, of course, you can just

07:36.320 --> 07:38.800
see that something went wrong with the apparatus.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.720
Like, you know, it's smoking, making,

07:41.720 --> 07:43.160
attracting.

07:43.160 --> 07:47.400
But often, in many cases in the history of science,

07:47.400 --> 07:49.640
we have results that were anomalous and looked

07:49.640 --> 07:51.120
like they cross problems with theories.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.160
And we will never know what went wrong,

07:53.160 --> 07:57.640
because it's just too late to go back and check.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.120
I'm sure we'll probably end up talking about some examples

08:00.120 --> 08:00.620
later on.

08:00.620 --> 08:08.100
But this Papa really never fully satisfactorily

08:08.100 --> 08:13.260
answered this question of when it's OK to blame the apparatus

08:13.260 --> 08:16.740
or other assumptions and when you should blame the theory.

08:16.740 --> 08:20.020
I think he had an interesting substantive things to say,

08:20.020 --> 08:24.140
but he didn't succeed in writing down what he was really

08:24.140 --> 08:28.020
after, which was a kind of a systematic calculus,

08:28.020 --> 08:30.700
if you like, for making these decisions.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.660
Something that took these decisions out

08:32.660 --> 08:35.820
of the hands of scientists who might be indulging

08:35.820 --> 08:37.220
in motivated reasoning, you know,

08:37.220 --> 08:39.820
trying to see their own theory in a good light

08:39.820 --> 08:42.100
and just sort of said, no, you must follow this logic.

08:42.100 --> 08:45.500
And this logic says your theory is wrong.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.980
Yeah, because I haven't read his book,

08:47.980 --> 08:49.940
where he introduced a principle, what's

08:49.940 --> 08:51.860
it called, the logic of science, I believe.

08:51.860 --> 08:54.860
But I don't think of scientific discovery, that's it.

08:54.860 --> 08:57.740
Yeah, I haven't read that book, although my understanding,

08:57.740 --> 08:59.140
again, at a very elementary level,

08:59.140 --> 09:02.060
is that it seems that Papa really

09:02.060 --> 09:06.420
wanted some kind of a priori principle or even theory

09:06.420 --> 09:10.060
of science that allows scientists to do science.

09:10.060 --> 09:13.740
And then what you would argue for, and many others,

09:13.740 --> 09:15.620
would be that, oh, well, unfortunately,

09:15.620 --> 09:19.060
for better or worse, let's say, we haven't found that.

09:19.060 --> 09:19.900
Yeah.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.940
And so what you, in fact, have is, you know,

09:21.940 --> 09:24.500
I kind of made it all sound more like a philosophical argument.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.780
But the fact of science, as you have real arguments

09:26.780 --> 09:30.940
over these things, should whether probably

09:30.940 --> 09:34.900
the result is just an artifact of some problem

09:34.900 --> 09:36.980
with the measuring apparatus or the theory really

09:36.980 --> 09:37.700
is in trouble.

09:37.700 --> 09:41.940
In fact, that's almost more normal than any other state

09:41.940 --> 09:42.440
of affairs.

09:42.440 --> 09:46.860
So some typically scientists who perform the experiment

09:46.860 --> 09:49.820
will trust the apparatus more than the scientists

09:49.820 --> 09:52.940
sort of a few labs over who weren't there to kind of see

09:52.940 --> 09:54.620
it all operating and so on.

09:54.620 --> 09:57.820
And, you know, in the end, if scientists

09:57.820 --> 09:58.940
keep going for long enough, there

09:58.940 --> 10:02.220
does seem to be a kind of a consensus that forms.

10:02.220 --> 10:04.060
The experiments get done enough times,

10:04.060 --> 10:06.060
they're enough different people.

10:06.060 --> 10:08.740
It's not as if we're just totally at sea,

10:08.740 --> 10:13.900
but it doesn't have this simple, crisp, objective,

10:13.900 --> 10:19.460
algorithmic feel to it that Papa was really reaching for.

10:19.460 --> 10:20.420
Yeah, yeah.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.420
Well, I guess that leads us to, I don't know if I should call

10:23.420 --> 10:25.980
it the antithesis, but at least let's say,

10:25.980 --> 10:29.900
well, juxtapose Thomas Kuhn's theory, the paradigm shift,

10:29.900 --> 10:35.180
the term that he popularized, with the Popperian principle.

10:35.180 --> 10:37.740
Yeah, so the structures of scientific revolutions,

10:37.740 --> 10:41.060
perhaps my favorite book on philosophy of science,

10:41.060 --> 10:44.460
yours is a healthy contender.

10:44.460 --> 10:50.580
And so in contrast to Karl Popper, Professor Ravens,

10:50.580 --> 10:51.940
how does Thomas Kuhn differ?

10:51.940 --> 10:55.380
Because he came after Popper, isn't that right, Sam?

10:55.380 --> 10:56.860
And what were his ideas?

10:56.860 --> 10:57.540
Yeah.

10:57.540 --> 11:01.540
So Papa wrote his book in the 1930s,

11:01.540 --> 11:04.380
and Kuhn wrote his book in the 1960s to give you some sense.

11:04.380 --> 11:07.580
So Popper is, in a way, essentially into war,

11:07.580 --> 11:12.220
I suppose we would now say, and Kuhn is very much post-war.

11:12.220 --> 11:15.260
And Popper was still firing on all cylinders by then,

11:15.260 --> 11:19.900
but he wasn't presenting whole new ideas.

11:19.940 --> 11:24.140
Well, he was entitled to have a break.

11:24.140 --> 11:27.020
So Kuhn's idea is actually, it doesn't dispense

11:27.020 --> 11:28.540
with the idea of a scientific method,

11:28.540 --> 11:30.820
as I was saying earlier, but rather the idea

11:30.820 --> 11:35.140
is that at any particular time period,

11:35.140 --> 11:40.420
a science, say like particle physics or molecular genetics

11:40.420 --> 11:43.500
or economics, maybe microeconomics,

11:43.500 --> 11:47.260
will have a particular method, a particular set of rules

11:47.260 --> 11:49.780
for doing science, and actually a rather comprehensive set

11:49.820 --> 11:52.420
of rules for doing science.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.900
But that these methods are not fixed for all time.

11:56.900 --> 12:00.060
In fact, they change from time to time

12:00.060 --> 12:04.100
in dramatic episodes called scientific revolutions,

12:04.100 --> 12:08.060
or the phrase that Kuhn famously popularized for this

12:08.060 --> 12:09.860
is our paradigm shift.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.140
And the thing, the paradigm here,

12:11.140 --> 12:14.460
is this kind of big method for doing science.

12:14.460 --> 12:18.300
And when it shifts, that means the old paradigm

12:18.300 --> 12:22.580
has crumbled, and a new one comes along and replaces it.

12:22.580 --> 12:25.580
So whereas Papa and the sort of classic,

12:25.580 --> 12:27.820
the classic searches for a scientific method,

12:27.820 --> 12:30.980
we're looking for a single rule that is valid for all time.

12:30.980 --> 12:33.460
As you said, hopefully our priority,

12:33.460 --> 12:38.460
one that we can just know is right without, with certainty.

12:40.060 --> 12:44.420
Kuhn thought these methods only last for a while,

12:44.420 --> 12:46.780
and then their scientists actually pushed them

12:46.780 --> 12:49.620
to the point where all of their flaws are exposed,

12:49.620 --> 12:51.420
because they're actually, they're very rich,

12:51.420 --> 12:52.820
but they're also kind of limited.

12:52.820 --> 12:54.340
They have a lot of assumptions built in,

12:54.340 --> 12:56.100
and inevitably some of those assumptions

12:56.100 --> 12:57.700
will turn out to be wrong.

12:57.700 --> 13:01.260
And so scientists pushed them to their breaking point.

13:01.260 --> 13:05.020
And in effect, they destroy their own methods

13:05.860 --> 13:09.300
by exposing the faulty assumptions or whatever.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.180
And then some new method has to come along

13:11.180 --> 13:13.020
and supplant the old method.

13:13.020 --> 13:16.020
A new paradigm comes along and supplants the old paradigm.

13:16.020 --> 13:17.060
That's a paradigm shift.

13:17.060 --> 13:18.340
That's a scientific revolution.

13:18.340 --> 13:22.500
Then you have a whole new methodological complex

13:22.500 --> 13:24.060
governing what scientists do

13:24.060 --> 13:27.060
in whatever area of science it is.

13:28.060 --> 13:32.180
So in this way of paradigm shifting, would it be,

13:32.180 --> 13:34.460
because it's not fair to say like, for instance,

13:34.460 --> 13:37.660
from the Newtonian worldview of classical mechanics,

13:37.660 --> 13:41.500
I'd say, to now with quantum theory, quantum mechanics,

13:41.500 --> 13:44.020
is that really a paradigm shift,

13:44.020 --> 13:47.340
or is a paradigm shift something where we have an epochal,

13:47.340 --> 13:51.140
something like from Aristotelian science or physics

13:51.140 --> 13:52.460
to what we have in modern science?

13:52.460 --> 13:54.300
Because the reality is we still,

13:54.300 --> 13:56.740
despite living now in the paradigm,

13:56.740 --> 14:00.180
let's say, of quantum theory and quantum mechanics,

14:00.180 --> 14:03.700
we still subscribe to certain Newtonian principles,

14:03.700 --> 14:04.540
for sure, right?

14:04.540 --> 14:06.580
And it's not like we've completely dismissed that.

14:07.820 --> 14:11.060
So how did, yeah, perhaps maybe flesh out a bit more

14:11.060 --> 14:12.940
what really is a paradigm shift.

14:14.140 --> 14:19.140
Yeah, well, I think that the change that is most central

14:21.900 --> 14:25.020
and to a paradigm shift, although it's not the only change,

14:25.020 --> 14:28.460
is a change in a kind of a whole theoretical conception

14:28.460 --> 14:30.580
of how the world works.

14:30.580 --> 14:34.140
So although on the superficially quantum mechanics

14:34.140 --> 14:37.620
or equally Einstein's general theory of relativity,

14:37.620 --> 14:39.980
so that the kind of the successor theory

14:39.980 --> 14:42.620
to Newton's work on gravitation in particular,

14:42.620 --> 14:47.620
although that preserves a lot of what Newton said

14:47.700 --> 14:50.380
in the sense of making the same predictions,

14:50.380 --> 14:53.100
the theoretical underpinnings look really different.

14:54.220 --> 14:56.220
So I'll do it with gravity.

14:57.140 --> 15:00.860
In Newton, there's this force that objects

15:00.860 --> 15:04.020
with mass exert on one another, they pull one another,

15:04.020 --> 15:07.900
and that's gravity and it causes them to accelerate

15:07.900 --> 15:12.260
and has spelled out by Newton's second law.

15:12.260 --> 15:15.140
But in Einstein's theory that replaced Newton's theory,

15:15.140 --> 15:18.300
there's no force directly between objects like that.

15:18.300 --> 15:23.300
Instead, objects impart this twist or curvature to space-time,

15:24.540 --> 15:27.380
and then other objects are trying to travel

15:27.380 --> 15:29.340
through that space-time, but because it's twisty,

15:29.340 --> 15:32.260
they themselves take a curvy path,

15:32.260 --> 15:35.140
which is just the path of, say, a body like the Earth

15:35.140 --> 15:36.940
or between the sun.

15:36.940 --> 15:39.460
Anyway, I probably shouldn't try to explain general,

15:40.060 --> 15:42.620
I'd rather hear you put it, but the point is it's a really,

15:42.620 --> 15:46.260
it's even though it makes a lot of the same predictions

15:46.260 --> 15:48.700
as Newton's theory, which it had better do

15:48.700 --> 15:52.140
because Newton's theory made so many correct predictions,

15:52.140 --> 15:53.940
it's a really different way of thinking

15:53.940 --> 15:58.300
about what's going on, and that's kind of at the core

15:58.300 --> 16:01.220
of what makes it a new paradigm.

16:01.220 --> 16:04.980
But it also suggests all of these new experiments

16:04.980 --> 16:08.340
that just wouldn't make sense in Newton's theory.

16:08.340 --> 16:13.300
So an example of that would be looking for the existence

16:13.300 --> 16:16.660
of gravitational waves, Einstein's theory predicts,

16:16.660 --> 16:20.580
because mass actually has an impact on space-time itself.

16:20.580 --> 16:25.300
When you have, especially very dramatic events

16:25.300 --> 16:27.260
like two colliding black holes,

16:27.260 --> 16:30.740
where actually cause space-time itself to shiver,

16:30.740 --> 16:32.820
like throwing a rock into a pool,

16:32.820 --> 16:35.100
you get these waves that ripple outwards.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.300
So you should be able to detect those

16:38.300 --> 16:40.420
if you build a sensitive enough apparatus,

16:40.420 --> 16:43.780
which physicists finally succeeded in doing

16:43.780 --> 16:46.180
in about eight years ago.

16:46.180 --> 16:48.020
I mean, they've been building it for about 50 years,

16:48.020 --> 16:51.260
but it finally detected gravitational waves in 2015.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.940
So you get all of these new ideas

16:52.940 --> 16:54.700
about what you might do with science,

16:54.700 --> 16:56.940
and that's characteristic of a paradigm shift.

16:56.940 --> 16:59.460
It's not just a set of new theoretical ideas,

16:59.460 --> 17:02.620
but all of these new ideas for actually doing science,

17:02.620 --> 17:04.580
new kinds of experiments or observations

17:04.660 --> 17:05.660
you could perform.

17:07.380 --> 17:11.940
So that's what makes that shift from,

17:11.940 --> 17:13.300
oh, you mentioned quantum mechanics,

17:13.300 --> 17:17.180
and I kind of subtly changed the example just to gravity,

17:17.180 --> 17:19.020
because it's, I think, a bit more straightforward.

17:19.020 --> 17:21.540
Yeah, the question stands, yeah.

17:21.540 --> 17:26.300
But the idea is it's the new paradigm managers

17:26.300 --> 17:28.620
to do on the surface superficially

17:28.620 --> 17:31.060
in terms of prediction and so on,

17:31.060 --> 17:32.860
a lot of what the old paradigm did,

17:32.860 --> 17:34.620
but it gives you a whole new picture

17:34.620 --> 17:36.140
of the way the universe is working

17:36.140 --> 17:39.500
that makes sense of those predictions.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.340
Yeah, in fact.

17:41.340 --> 17:42.980
Your method for doing science suggests

17:42.980 --> 17:45.780
all of these new experiments you might do and so on.

17:45.780 --> 17:49.260
Yeah, I was thinking of more of a contemporary example of this,

17:49.260 --> 17:53.100
and I realized, I'm reading this book also by Tim Modellin,

17:53.100 --> 17:57.420
the philosopher of science on quantum non-locality,

17:57.420 --> 18:00.980
and there's an interesting kind of story of Einstein,

18:00.980 --> 18:06.700
because John Bell, he mathematically proved quantum non-locality,

18:06.700 --> 18:09.540
I believe in the 80s or 90s,

18:09.540 --> 18:12.260
and then Tim Modellin, he's like one of his,

18:12.260 --> 18:13.620
John Bell is like one of his heroes,

18:13.620 --> 18:16.940
and then I believe in the Nobel Prize in Physics

18:16.940 --> 18:19.580
was awarded to the laureates

18:19.580 --> 18:23.460
who proved quantum non-locality,

18:23.460 --> 18:26.340
it's mouthful, experimentally,

18:26.340 --> 18:28.940
and then in the book he talks about how Einstein

18:28.940 --> 18:32.460
didn't want to accept this idea of non-locality

18:32.460 --> 18:34.460
because his theory was in fact local,

18:34.460 --> 18:38.380
and he called it a spooky action at a distance,

18:38.380 --> 18:40.660
but then of course now that we have mathematical proof

18:40.660 --> 18:43.500
and empirical evidence, let's say,

18:43.500 --> 18:47.260
which kind of sticks to your own rule of explanation,

18:47.260 --> 18:49.500
it seems like we're kind of going through that paradigm shift

18:49.500 --> 18:52.260
where, well, I guess physics isn't local anymore

18:52.260 --> 18:53.860
in the way we thought,

18:53.860 --> 18:56.860
and I find that endlessly fascinating

18:56.860 --> 19:00.220
how it just completely shifts not only our theories,

19:00.220 --> 19:02.540
but just even at a very essential level

19:02.540 --> 19:05.900
how we view the world and experience the world.

19:05.900 --> 19:08.100
Yeah, that's a great example of, again,

19:08.100 --> 19:10.860
of a paradigm shift where you get this new kind of

19:10.860 --> 19:14.180
fundamental, theoretical apparatus of quantum mechanics,

19:14.180 --> 19:16.780
and that makes these weird predictions about non-locality,

19:16.780 --> 19:18.260
and so it suggests this,

19:18.260 --> 19:20.220
all of these scientific experiments you might do

19:20.220 --> 19:22.860
that wouldn't have made any sense in Newtonian physics,

19:22.860 --> 19:25.660
and in particular those Nobel Prize winning experiments

19:25.660 --> 19:28.420
that really established that the predictions

19:28.420 --> 19:30.820
of the theory really were accurate.
