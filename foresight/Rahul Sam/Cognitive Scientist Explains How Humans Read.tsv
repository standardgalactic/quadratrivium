0	5840	So the other bit is and what I love about the book is this is also in a way sort of like a book on
5840	13360	on like social psychology because it's a lot on what laypeople believe and in fact being a layperson
13360	21920	myself I kind of had this belief too for the longest time which is I've always equated what we call
22000	29120	human language to reading and in the the blind story teller you state in page 203
29760	35040	if you don't mind me reading it you say many people think of reading as a process of visual
35040	40960	pattern recognition for example being able to consistently register the contrast between
40960	47440	symmetrical letters such as D and B if that is the case then it stands to reason that when reading
47440	56160	goes ori the culprit is a visual deficit but but in reality visual patterns are just a means to an
56160	63040	end which is language reading is a technology that gets you there so uh professor if you could
63040	68880	delineate what the difference between reading and languages uh that that would be great please
69600	74320	so there are two things we need to explain what is reading and how it differs from language
74320	81600	yes so the true theory what is the true science about and the second is what people think how this
81600	86560	all works so there is the scientific theory and there is the intuitive theory which happens to
86560	94080	be in disagreement and that's where we mess things up so um so there is a sense in which reading is
94080	100640	very different from language um I often start my psychology of language classes uh by working really
100640	105360	hard to disabuse not people of the notion that language and reading are the same thing they aren't
106320	111840	language is natural you take every child they will develop language if you don't expose them to
111840	118880	language they will grow one naturally even they're not exposed to a language um they do it naturally
118880	125760	they don't need language lessons uh reading is not like that so most children if you don't teach
125760	130400	them how to read explicitly they will never read there are tons of societies that they're doing
130400	137440	just well without reading and writing um not so for language so language is universal to all human
137440	147200	societies reading is not so they're divorced in this sense for sure nonetheless there is this
147200	154400	interesting property of human brains that the neuroscientist Danislas de Han has pointed out
154400	162720	which is when human brains come to invent a new system they don't invent it completely a new
163440	170320	but rather what they do is recycle existing systems that are innate and kind of repurpose
170320	177280	them for the new uh for this new purpose and the link between reading and language exactly
177280	185760	follows those lines so when you look at how reading systems are designed they could have been
185760	191200	completely divorced from language they could have been completely arbitrary but that's not the case
191200	198880	because the letters that we use for a system like a phobetic system like English correspond to
198960	208800	linguistic sounds for the most part um even in writing systems as in Mandarin it's true that there
208800	215840	are visual origins of the symbols that they call they also have semantic component but eventually
215840	222160	what they stand up for is also phonological sounds they spend they they stand for syllables
223040	229920	so it turns out that when uh people come to invent language they kind of design it on the
229920	237920	principles of how language works you can think about it in terms of human brains when they start
237920	243680	processing language they start with the phonology and then so when you perceive speech that the
243680	249280	first thing that you get is the sound structure of language and from there you proceed to syntax
249280	256320	and so forth so it's like to go on the linguistic highway so to speak in the brain you need to start
256320	262400	by having some phonological code so if you're trying to hijack the same highway to create
263200	271360	reading you better start by doing by encoding phonology as well and that's how explain the
271360	278000	correspondence between how reading works and how language works reading as a system is taking the
278000	285200	language or or hijacking a component of the language system and repurposing it to for a new
285840	297520	technology and that is why all reading systems that we know encode some phonological units at
297520	301600	some level it doesn't necessarily need to be at the level of phonemes it could be syllables but
301600	309200	there is also some phonological component there is ton of research that shows that when you and I
309200	314320	read well I'm not a native speaker but when I read in my language and you read in your language
315360	323120	even though we read silently we will automatically extract all this phonological component as
323120	328560	integral part of the reading process so you think about reading as a visual affair it's something
328640	336960	that happens only in your eyes of course it begins with the eyes but it looks like it invariably
336960	343360	goes through the phonological system at some point or else reading does not work as it should
344640	350400	so you must get some aspects of the phonology of what you read how do we know that because if
350400	357920	you get two words that have the same phonology such as rose the flower and roses in two rows of
359040	366560	chairs people confuse them all the time even if you'll have ROZE which is not the word people will
366560	373440	also confuse them and using the proper experiments you can show that it's really the phonology that
373440	381600	that confuses them which shows that people have consulted this information or else they would
381600	391120	not have been confused so the point about showing how we stumble is to show how reading actually
391120	398560	works and the fact that it actually works is using phonology it's using this part of language
398560	404240	so that's the real theory of reading and we also know that when you know that the ability to perceive
404240	410480	sounds is so it's not just phonology but also speech when the ability to perceive speech sounds
410480	417440	is impaired this is a characteristic of dyslexia so people with dyslexia have problem with perceiving
417440	427840	speech sounds now that's not that what laypeople think so if you ask a layperson you know johnny
427840	433680	can't read here you know he's a six year old and he can't read what do you think is wrong with him
433680	439280	and invariably people tell you there is something that's wrong with their eyes and if they think
439280	445920	that there is something that's wrong with billy because of jimmy whatever i guess and that if the
445920	451680	problem is congenital which we know that's the case in dyslexia that that um it is a congenital
451680	458640	disorder people invariably think the problem can only be in the eyes it can't be the
458720	470560	abstract phonological thing um this arises from this intuition that people hold that what's
470560	476080	we hold innately so if you know that the problem is congenital that he was born with that then it
476080	483120	must be somewhere in their body the people don't think just genes they think like in the eyes in
483120	489600	the ears it can be something that is abstract that doesn't make sense that the ability to so what
490400	496000	dyslexia really is about is in part the mechanism that allow you to map letters to sound and which
496000	502160	is an abstract kind of cognitive mechanism and people have trouble recognizing that something
502160	512880	like that could possibly be um involved or or or impaired innately so this is unfortunate because
512880	521040	um it's uh first because people misunderstand what dyslexia is all about and and that's a problem
521040	526800	because um if you think that you know if you have a child and you think that the only signal of
526800	535120	dyslexia is switching letters then you will find fail to identify and and and um help these children
535120	542800	with uh early as they need to as you need to um but indirectly it also tells you some something
542800	549600	about how we think about what is innate and what is inateness and um uh and explain some of the
549600	556720	other biases that I've shown in this book uh that show how our misconception about what
557680	567440	about how what what is innate uh lead us to this crazy conclusion that what we know cannot possibly
567440	579280	have an innate basis
