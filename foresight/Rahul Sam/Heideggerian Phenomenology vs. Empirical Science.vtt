WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
I do want to say something about the way in which Heidegger

00:03.360 --> 00:06.720
defines phenomenology, because I think it's a very brilliant

00:06.720 --> 00:08.720
sort of description of it.

00:10.720 --> 00:17.200
And so Heidegger, when he's describing phenomenology and

00:17.200 --> 00:21.600
being in time, but also in the lecture course, given a few years

00:21.600 --> 00:24.080
before he published being in time, and that lecture course is

00:24.080 --> 00:25.600
called the History of the Concept of Time.

00:26.320 --> 00:30.480
Sorry, just to clarify, so being in time is Heidegger's

00:30.480 --> 00:34.400
machemopus, right? We should probably put that out. Yeah.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.040
Sorry, I didn't interrupt you. Jacob, keep going. Yeah.

00:37.040 --> 00:40.800
No, no, you're good. Yeah, being in time is what he's most famous for.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.600
Even though, I mean, he wrote a lot. He has a lot of books. He has a lot of papers.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.360
His later work differs a little bit from his early work,

00:49.360 --> 00:53.120
but there's also a dispute as to how real the turn is.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.680
Later Heidegger and early Heidegger, yeah.

00:57.680 --> 01:02.560
Yeah, and I'm not really knowledgeable enough to comment on how

01:02.560 --> 01:05.840
different those two things are. I'm kind of working my way chronologically

01:05.840 --> 01:12.480
through this moment's work. But yeah, in being in time and his earlier

01:12.480 --> 01:18.240
lecture course, he described phenomenology by going back to

01:19.440 --> 01:25.280
the ways in which the Greeks use the term phenomenon in logos.

01:25.280 --> 01:29.120
So he's kind of taking apart the term phenomenology

01:29.120 --> 01:36.000
and separating it and looking to the Greek definitions of this.

01:36.880 --> 01:43.920
And in the book, Heidegger says that the Greeks understood the term phenomenon

01:43.920 --> 01:50.080
as, this is going to sound very obscure and esoteric, but I'm going to give,

01:50.080 --> 01:52.800
hopefully, an easier to understand description afterward.

01:52.800 --> 01:58.640
But he says, phenomenon is that which shows itself in itself, the manifest.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.160
Typical Heidegger.

02:00.160 --> 02:06.320
Yeah, and the term for the Greeks also carried connotation of bringing

02:06.320 --> 02:12.960
something to life and eliminating. And then the logos, Heidegger explained,

02:12.960 --> 02:18.320
the Greeks understood by the logos something like discoursing, but not just like,

02:18.320 --> 02:21.840
not just dialogue and not just a verbal utterance, but

02:21.840 --> 02:27.520
it's more of a discursive communication that lets something be seen.

02:28.880 --> 02:36.240
And so you could think of the logos as words, whether uttered or written down

02:36.240 --> 02:42.560
or what have you, that point to something, they let something be seen.

02:42.560 --> 02:47.040
It's kind of bringing something to life, it's bringing the phenomenon to life.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.880
And so we want to understand this in a less obscure and difficult way than

02:50.960 --> 02:57.840
Heidegger likes to put things. We can say something like, the logos points to the

02:57.840 --> 03:03.040
phenomenon in such a way that the phenomenon becomes un-concealed or the logos allows the

03:03.040 --> 03:07.840
phenomenon to come into view by looking and out of experience in such a way that it can be seen.

03:07.840 --> 03:13.360
And so really, it's almost like your words should connect with something that can be

03:13.360 --> 03:17.520
pointed out in experience or can be shown in experience. And so we're not,

03:18.480 --> 03:24.400
and he contrasts this with the idea of free-floating concepts and words and ideas.

03:25.760 --> 03:32.240
And by that, he just means something like, we don't want to abstract away so much from experience

03:32.960 --> 03:40.560
that we're just playing language games. We want our words to be able to meet up with experience

03:40.560 --> 03:46.880
in such a way that if I say something, it's all like in some of my papers about meaning what

03:46.960 --> 03:51.360
I'm trying to do, as I'm trying to point to experience, I'm trying to point to

03:51.920 --> 03:57.840
particular experiences and particular moments in particular experiences where maybe

03:58.880 --> 04:08.320
someone might find meaning. So I'm just trying to bring something into view using words and concepts.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.320
I'm glad you said that, Jico, because in one of your papers, I forget which one,

04:14.320 --> 04:17.920
you've sort of touched on this, but a question that came to mind was,

04:19.120 --> 04:25.440
so from the definition you gave, definition of phenomenology, how does that differ from, let's

04:25.440 --> 04:32.160
say, the empiricist tradition or the empiricist approach, which tends to be quite popular these

04:32.160 --> 04:37.280
days, especially in the world of artificial intelligence, where we think that our epistemology

04:37.280 --> 04:44.240
or our knowledge or our truths of the world is revealed purely based on empiricism, which is

04:44.240 --> 04:50.480
experiencing, measuring things, and that in some sense, the mind is a blank canvas and

04:50.480 --> 04:56.240
the world just gives us information and input. So from the empirical approach, how does phenomenology

04:56.240 --> 05:02.080
differ? So phenomenology is going to differ in the sense that, okay, so if we think about the

05:02.080 --> 05:11.040
empirical approach specifically as it pertains to the sciences, we're getting, we're trying to get a

05:11.040 --> 05:17.200
collection of experiences that kind of compile and point toward the same sort of thing and experience.

05:19.360 --> 05:26.400
Now, a major difference, I guess, is going to be what it is we're trying to discern in empirical

05:26.400 --> 05:30.640
science, as opposed to something like Pythagoras phenomenology, the way that I just described

05:30.720 --> 05:42.080
phenomenology. With a scientific and empirical approach, we're usually looking at objects and

05:42.080 --> 05:50.880
we're trying to figure out what sort of properties these objects have. And so, I mean, I guess physics

05:50.880 --> 05:54.720
or chemistry is a great example of that. And we're trying to see maybe what

05:54.720 --> 06:02.160
how two entities interact with each other. And we're going to perform experiments to do that,

06:02.160 --> 06:08.640
and we're going to try to replicate the experiments. And we're going to try to not let our first person,

06:08.640 --> 06:15.520
perspective, influence exactly what we're investigating. So phenomenology is going to

06:15.520 --> 06:20.000
differ from that. In that we're not, we're not collecting data and we're not measuring stuff.

06:20.960 --> 06:25.760
We're experiencing, we're trying to pay attention to the experience as it's experienced. So you're

06:25.760 --> 06:33.680
not going to measure your experience of meaning, say you're going to more so, if you're doing a

06:33.680 --> 06:39.680
phenomenology and you're trying to discern maybe what you find meaningful, you're going to more

06:39.680 --> 06:47.600
sort of reflect on maybe the way that you feel when you were participating in a certain activity.

06:47.840 --> 06:54.800
And from there, you might also start to look at the structures of the experience,

06:55.840 --> 07:01.040
more so than just the feeling of the experience, which might be, you know, what's involved in

07:01.040 --> 07:07.520
this activity or what's involved in this experience. What are the things that are essential to the

07:07.520 --> 07:12.960
experience without which I could no longer say that it was a meaningful experience? Those are the

07:12.960 --> 07:17.120
sorts of things that phenomena, that sort of questions phenomenology is going to ask. And

07:17.120 --> 07:23.040
specifically high digger, because specifically for high digger, he's wanting to look, he's wanting to

07:24.640 --> 07:30.560
discern the a priori structures of existence and experience, which is just to say

07:32.480 --> 07:40.800
a priori meaning always already there. Like what's necessary? What are the, what, what, what

07:40.800 --> 07:45.600
structures are necessary for this to exist or for me to have this particular experience?

07:46.400 --> 07:49.520
Yeah, I guess I'll leave it at that for now, because otherwise I'm going to get into a really

07:49.520 --> 07:53.200
deep, or you can ask a clarifying question, because otherwise I'm just going to go on at the end.

07:53.840 --> 08:00.800
No, that was perfect, mate. I think in many ways you, you, you lead me to my next question. I mean,

08:00.800 --> 08:06.320
I thought we were going to discuss existentialism too, because obviously it's kind of like the

08:06.320 --> 08:12.080
precursor, so not the precursor, but it's highly correlated to phenomenology. But perhaps since

08:12.080 --> 08:18.400
we're already on this topic, you see, in some sense, I kind of regret even asking that question,

08:18.400 --> 08:25.040
because I'm coming to realize that maybe it's not fair to ask questions such as, oh, what's the

08:26.000 --> 08:32.720
difference? Or what's the stark difference between phenomenology and science? Because if you think

08:32.720 --> 08:39.120
of a field like, let's say, psychology or cognitive science, those fields have had a massive influence

08:39.120 --> 08:48.000
by thinkers like Merleau Ponty or Heidegger by phenomenologists. So, well, the question I was

08:48.000 --> 08:53.360
going to ask is how does phenomenology, and I was also going to say existentialism, but we didn't

08:53.360 --> 08:58.880
get to that still, but let's just say how does phenomenology differ from a more scientific

08:58.880 --> 09:05.120
approach? But maybe to make things even a bit more interesting, let's talk about, in fact,

09:05.120 --> 09:09.680
how does it relate to fields like psychology and cognitive science, where in the world of,

09:09.680 --> 09:14.320
in the scientific approach, what we always try and do is take the, remove the subject, so remove

09:14.320 --> 09:19.920
the subjective experience. But clearly, there are some fields, even within science, where you

09:19.920 --> 09:25.200
can't do that, you can't remove the subject from cognitive science or psychology. So maybe to make

09:25.200 --> 09:30.080
things a bit more interesting, how do they correlate, how do they connect to phenomenology,

09:30.080 --> 09:37.120
those fields I mentioned? Sure, sure. So I want to comment on cognitive science just a little

09:37.120 --> 09:41.520
bit first, and then I want to maybe dive into a little bit of neuroscience and how phenomenology

09:41.520 --> 09:48.720
might be related, because I actually presented a paper last year at a philosophy conference

09:48.720 --> 09:53.120
hosted by a university in the Czech Republic on this topic of phenomenology neuroscience. But

09:53.200 --> 09:59.600
before I get to that, something that I really appreciate about cognitive science is that

10:01.440 --> 10:09.440
it really embraces the subjective experience. And like you said, you can't remove that from

10:09.440 --> 10:21.520
cognitive science, cognitive science, necessarily. And I think the most prevailing approach in

10:21.520 --> 10:25.920
cognitive science right now is 4E cognitive science. And that's just the 440s. I always forget

10:25.920 --> 10:31.920
one, but it stands for embeddedness, embodied, inactive. And I, like I said, I always forget the

10:31.920 --> 10:39.040
fourth one. I don't know why, but I'll leave a little caption or whatever, just too far. It was

10:39.040 --> 10:45.600
all good. Yeah. Yeah, have somebody place in the comment. Kind of take the video. Yeah, it's fine.

10:45.760 --> 10:55.920
But a lot of it, so a lot of those ideas, really, I mean, I believe have an inception in

10:55.920 --> 11:02.080
phenomenology. I mean, they're, you know, especially in Heidegger, with Heidegger's idea of being in

11:02.080 --> 11:08.400
the world, you know, which we'll get to. But it's just this idea that there's a more holistic

11:08.400 --> 11:16.400
structure to the world and existence that we need to take into consideration when we're trying to

11:16.400 --> 11:21.360
understand things about the world and trying to understand things about ourselves and maybe the

11:21.360 --> 11:30.000
way in which we interact with the environment. And so I think phenomenology played at least

11:30.000 --> 11:34.560
the role in trying and getting a lot of those ideas going for cognitive science.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.880
Now, as far as neuroscience goes,

11:42.880 --> 11:48.160
Anil set, I'm sure you've heard of Anil set. Yes, I have. Yep. He recently bought a

11:48.160 --> 11:54.560
quite a popular science book right on the brain. And so he does a lot of work trying to

11:57.760 --> 12:03.360
map the brain correlates of certain experiences. So he's trying to see, like, what's going on in

12:03.360 --> 12:09.280
the brain at a given time when someone's having a particular experience. And he's trying to build

12:09.280 --> 12:16.560
that map out. And you can't build that map if you don't have good phenomenology. Because

12:17.600 --> 12:22.880
if you, if you, if you think, just think about it, if we think about it simply, as far as, okay,

12:22.880 --> 12:32.400
let's say brain region X lights up when I have experience Y. And let's say we can, we can gather

12:32.480 --> 12:38.960
all the data we want about the brain structure and we can reproduce it and map it as much as we

12:38.960 --> 12:42.720
want. But if we don't have a good description of the experience, we're not going to know what

12:42.720 --> 12:50.080
we're mapping this brain activity to. And so in order to have good correlative mapping, we have

12:50.080 --> 12:54.560
to have good phenomenology. We have to have like a good description of the experience. And we have

12:54.560 --> 12:59.680
to have people, the participants in the study that they're studying, trying to get this

13:00.240 --> 13:05.840
correlative mapping going. They have to be familiar with the experience, not only as it is

13:05.840 --> 13:11.040
experienced, but they have to understand what it is that the neuroscientists are trying to map,

13:11.040 --> 13:16.320
like what experience do you want me to have? So then I can tell you what I'm having, so you can,

13:16.320 --> 13:23.120
you know, mark down what's going on in my brain when I'm having that experience. And so you have

13:23.120 --> 13:29.600
to have a whole lot of phenomenology going on, not only the person being the participant being

13:29.600 --> 13:35.840
able to recognize the experience and being able to communicate that to the researchers, but the

13:35.840 --> 13:40.480
researchers also have to have a pretty rich phenomenological description of what it is they

13:40.480 --> 13:47.840
want their participants to experience. And that way they know precisely when the experience is

13:47.840 --> 13:51.200
started, because you might, I mean, there might be like a very important, as far as neuroscience

13:51.680 --> 13:57.120
there might be a very important spike in a particular brain region that they are trying

13:57.120 --> 14:06.080
to map to a very specific, maybe milliseconds of an experience. And if you don't get that right,

14:06.080 --> 14:08.480
it's just not going to be correct. Your description is going to be wrong and your

14:08.480 --> 14:13.520
correlative mapping isn't going to mean anything, because you might have one side of it,

14:13.520 --> 14:21.040
but you're going to be missing the other side of it.
