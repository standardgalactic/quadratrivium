0	7000	Okay, this is really interesting because I was going to ask you before, and I wasn't even sure if I should ask this question because
8680	13240	Initially, I thought you were purely an analytical philosopher and then the more I read your work
13240	18560	I saw you mentioning Foucault. I saw you mentioning psychoanalysis. I was like, oh great. Now I could ask you this
19680	22920	What are your general views on psychoanalysis and
23760	25760	personally, I come more from the
26640	29080	continental psychoanalytic tradition. That's where
30000	32000	I'm most of my reading.
32000	39680	So getting to this conversation and then what's your general view on psychoanalysis and how it pertains to cognitive science
40400	46080	and AI, let's say, and does it have anything to say, anything useful to add to those fields?
48600	53280	So I would say that there's a kind of conventional scientist attitude of like,
53560	58000	isn't this all just nonsense? Like we've come up with better psychological theories since then. We have
58240	62880	science. Like why do we need psychoanalysis? Why are we reading these people from a hundred years ago?
63520	65520	And I think that's a view I used to hold.
66040	71800	I think my, I think partially I've updated because I think a lot of the
74000	76000	I think the overall quality of
77880	83320	Scientific or experimental psychology is lower than I used to think it was and I think in popular discourse
83320	88440	this corresponds to things like the replication crisis of like maybe a lot of these things can't actually
88920	94960	like whatever we're currently doing that we're calling psychological science is not actually producing very reliable results.
95760	104600	And I do have more respect for more like deep thinkers who are more generalists who think about a variety of things using various methodology,
104600	109640	not just scientific methodology. And so I haven't actually read very many of these people, but
110640	116640	broadly it seems like they have important ideas. It seems like it's probably worth people who are into psychology reading them.
118640	120640	I think that,
122640	125640	yeah, I think some of these have like very
127640	133640	like a kind of general psychological concepts that are possible to apply to lots of situations. There's things like the
133640	138640	ids, the ego, the super ego, and like the idea of repressed desires. There's things like
140640	142640	like the Lacanian
143640	147640	trichotomy between the psychotic, the neurotic, and the pervert. And
149640	155640	I think that there, they can be pretty useful models for thinking about a variety of things.
156640	167640	They're not quite at the level of science in the sense that it's like not enough of a theory that you can say like, here's exactly what it predicts. Here's it would falsify it.
168640	176640	But I think it's often fruitful to like think of a situation and apply some of these models to it and then at least be able to come up with something.
177640	180640	Like some interpretation of the situation that's like a starting point,
181640	183640	even if it's not like,
185640	193640	like, therefore, my interpretation is correct. It's like, therefore, I have an interpretation and I can think about like what that implies. Is it at all testable and so on?
195640	199640	Sure, sure. So on the note, Jessica, you know, you had another post called a critical,
199640	213640	agential account of free will and causation or free will causation of physics. And then you use, so the term agent, it's used across all your work, which makes sense, you know, if you're talking about AI and whatnot.
214640	228640	And what are your views? Because in psychoanalysis, we have what we call the subject, right? And the subject is a loaded term, even over from Khan, the German idealist use it, and then subject, it means many things, right?
229640	240640	Whereas the term agent, I think is more apt for conversations around AI and even perhaps cognitive science.
240640	258640	So, in your view, what differentiates a subject as to how it's used, let's say, psychoanalysis from an agent of as to how it's used in, let's say, game theory or even AI or cocci.
259640	271640	Okay, so I would say that I, to be clear, I haven't read a lot of the psychoanalyst, but in my mind, a major distinction is that the subject is primarily something like a world model.
272640	288640	It's a way of ontologizing the world and determining what is in the world and some idea of the self and how the self relates to the world. And I definitely think of Khan's philosophy as specifying what a subject is.
289640	304640	Like the idea of the a priori space and time isn't objective clock time, it's a kind of subjective timeline in which the sensory phenomena are organized and so on.
304640	315640	Whereas I would say that agent is more about, it does include a world model, but it especially focuses on action and values.
315640	325640	So an agent is capable of doing something, not just perceiving the world, and these actions are often for some purpose.
325640	330640	So in game theory, it would be to maximize a utility function.
330640	350640	And it, and I think in my post on critical agential metaphysics, it's, it's not so much about optimizing utility function so much as taking actions so as to do things such as test scientific theories, or operationalize them.
350640	354640	Instead of simply being like more like a passive observer.
354640	357640	Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
357640	368640	Okay, on the note, you, in fact, I found you through this post you're a post on less room, a short conceptual explainer of Emmanuel Khan's recent.
368640	386640	And at the time I was reading a lot of Khan and I was not that I in any way I'm an expert on this but I couldn't believe how succinctly you've explained all of Khan's concepts because as you may know, the German idealists and the countries in general are notoriously very difficult to read.
387640	389640	So, okay.
389640	405640	Again, general question. What do you think modern cocci and AI can learn from, let's say, can't, and then the post content such as the German idealists, you know, hey girl Victor Schilling, all of them.
405640	415640	Do you think there's anything worthwhile to to get from these philosophers, or are they just, you know, artifacts of the past.
415640	426640	So I would say conch for sure. And I think I can specify that more so like I do think of conch as in some ways an AI and cognitive science person.
426640	429640	Before those were much of a thing.
429640	437640	Because what he's doing is he's saying there's this task of understanding the world in general, which seems like fairly unbounded.
437640	450640	Philosophy specifically, there might be a more bounded thing I can do here, which is determine what what is the cognitive machinery that the human subject uses to conceive of the world.
450640	466640	And if I can complete this task, then perhaps the the general task of understanding the world is mostly just iterations and things following from this rather than then like basically having to work out the foundations and new each time.
466640	474640	And so, when he's thinking about the the the subject.
474640	487640	There's, there's a notion of the a priori, which is which is certainly a concept using cognitive science and AI in terms of Bayesianism and I in the post I give some relationships between those and Bayesian theories.
487640	496640	One of it is like what what do you have to assume at the start before you even take in data and use those two test theories.
496640	506640	Like you, you have to have some machinery already in place for doing things like organizing perceptions into space and time.
506640	513640	You can't learn about time without already having time because time learning takes place in time.
513640	530640	That certainly would if if clarified that would have implications about AI because that would say something about what you have to put into an AI at the start in its mind for it to even be able to learn in the first place.
530640	546640	So in terms of ideas about things like like schemata, or, or like combining a concept, such as the cat with your visual field where you, you kind of see a splotch of orange and then you're like oh it's a cat.
546640	555640	That seems to have a lot in common with computer vision because computer visions about mapping a concept, like the concept of a cat to a visual field.
556640	570640	I wouldn't particularly say that that he's that like he knows how to solve a lot of these problems like computer vision but his work certainly raises a lot of them and like fairly over on early on even before they were computers.
570640	584640	So I think in part it might be useful as a sort of reference point of someone in the past thinking about a lot of the questions of how a mind works, and who's been commented on quite a lot by others.
584640	589640	Even before computers and so on.
589640	611640	I would say even more speculatively there might be things to learn about ontology from Kant in terms of things like like defining ontology in terms of things like space time and sensory fields, a phenomena might have utility if you if you want an AI to have a kind of ontology of
611640	615640	a world that you can talk to it in.
615640	631640	Then you might want it to have something like a 3D model of subjective space time that is somehow related to your 3D model of subjective space time, and have something like a common language for specifying objects I mentioned before the problem of,
631640	645640	if you wanted a paperclip maximizer how would you specify a paperclip and you might want to do it using a sort of Contian method where you think about like, like, like the paperclip in terms of doesn't have a location in space time.
645640	651640	What are its properties in terms of in terms of phenomena and like extension and so on.
