0	4760	Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the NRLM podcast and today
4760	10920	I'll be reading out guiding axiom number four that I wrote for my newsletter, The Unhappy Man.
10920	14960	And in case you haven't been following these axioms that I've been
14960	19880	animerating in the past couple episodes, essentially there were seven axioms I
19880	25800	laid down for my newsletter, The Unhappy Man, as I did mention before. And I
25800	32320	realized, wow, by me writing and thinking clearly, these axioms that I'm laying
32320	39320	down really are a framework for all of my creative work. And that obviously includes
39320	44480	this podcast and whatever, interviews, scripts, I don't know,
44480	49920	dispositions, whatever I do on this podcast, I'm hoping to do it via these
49920	54920	axioms, via this framework. And I certainly don't want it to be
55280	61040	something that confines me or something that sort of, let's say, that doesn't
61040	66320	allow me to, that shackles me. I'd rather hope that it's a good place to start
66320	70800	from, and then open up into somewhere because I mean, I need some kind of stable
70800	75520	footing. And that's why I thought it's wise and prudent, especially given my
75520	82240	nature to get lost in obscure thoughts and sometimes nonsense. It's healthy to
82240	86360	have some axioms, especially at a respectful reader or a listener in this
86360	95520	case. So axiom number four, five, and six, I don't want to just do what I have
95520	100120	been doing in the previous episodes, or the previous axioms that I've been
100120	103480	reading out, where I've mostly been just reading it out of the essay I've
103480	109360	written. Rather, I want to maybe pause in the middle, have a bit of commentary,
110160	114800	expand as, you know, the good thing about a podcast is it allows me to do that.
116000	119280	And I think the reason for that is because I realized, you know, laying down
119280	123120	these axioms, because I wasn't writing a lot at that time, it took me a bit of
123120	128600	time to be about three to four months, not because they're deep and profound or
128600	134960	dense in any way. In my opinion, they're pretty superficial, not too deep
135200	141680	thinking. However, well, the reason it took a long time is because I just had
141680	145840	other commitments. I couldn't write that much. However, what I was trying to make
145840	154400	was that in those few months itself, I've been reflecting a lot on kind of a
154400	159800	revelation, let's say, that I had in the past two years or so. It wasn't a
159800	164000	sudden thing. It wasn't one event. It was a gradual change I had in my thinking.
164800	171360	Both existentially, theologically, and as a result of that, perhaps,
171360	176800	philosophically. And these three axioms, so four, five, six, that I'm going to cover
176800	182400	for today and then five and six in future episodes, they're really important for me.
183360	187520	They are important in the sense that they're very existentially put into the
187520	192320	current place I'm in life. And I'm trying to deeply read thinkers such as
192480	199280	Slavoj Žižek, Hortelik, and Nietzsche of Coz, and recently even the theologian Peter
199280	204960	Rollins. These thinkers have had an unbelievable impact on how I viewed
204960	209360	everything, especially Christianity, given that I'm a Christian. And therefore,
209920	214240	because in many ways my identity comes from that relationship I have with
214240	220480	Christianity and Christ, when my Christian beliefs are subverted, I myself am subverted.
221440	226240	So these these axioms are important for me, four, five, and six, and I hope to
227280	231760	carry on this podcast in the spirit of these axioms as I've said many times before.
231760	238320	Anyway, that's enough of a introduction or prelude. I shall get started. Today is
238320	244720	guiding axiom number four. It's called on writing, or in this case on podcasting,
244800	251200	without lies, machinations, and bullshit. And of course, since I didn't mention in that
251760	257760	unnecessarily long introduction, the link to the original article or essay is down
257760	263440	in the description along with the other guiding axioms too. It's infinitely easier to know of a
263440	272160	lie than what is true. Existentially, a lie is not a mere untrue, but an utterance of non-being.
273120	279040	I got this term from Paul Tillich, by the way. And to be aware of non-being is more than the
279040	286400	conceptual theoretical understanding of a philosophical concept. Once it's felt spiritually,
286400	293360	the anxiety it imbues can leave one perturbed and unhinged. Such as why Paul Tillich states,
294000	300640	anxiety is the existential awareness of non-being, the courage to be, page 35.
301760	308800	The anxiety Tillich writes of is not the medicalized kind a psychiatrist would prescribe a drug to
308800	316640	or a new age self-help guru would try to solve with a mindfulness course. It's inescapably
316640	322560	a part of our being. In fact, Tillich says that this anxiety is ontological. As he continues
322560	328000	on the courage to be page 36, perhaps I should not keep reading out the page numbers because
328000	332160	that's kind of annoying, isn't it? I'll just say the name of the book and obviously in the
332160	336880	original article that I'll link below, you'll see all the sources and pages and whatnot.
338000	343920	So getting back to this, existential in this sentence means that it is not the abstract
343920	350800	knowledge of non-being which produces anxiety, but the awareness that non-being is a part of
350880	359120	one's own being. Anxiety is finitude, experienced as one's own finitude. This is the natural
359120	365760	anxiety of man as man and in some way of all living beings, it is the anxiety of non-being,
365760	373040	the awareness of one's finitude as finitude. So in this play of words that Tillich is doing here,
373040	378960	what I understood it to be as that what we talk of anxiety angst or the idea of finitude, it is
379680	385760	it is ontic in nature. It is the starting point. It isn't, in that sense, perhaps he gets it from
385760	391040	psychoanalysis where, you know, I think the Freudian notion is, I mean, no way an expert
391040	398960	in psychoanalysis, but my very superficial reading is that being born into this world itself is
398960	405200	traumatic. It's trauma. We're born with trauma and our embellishment into being is a traumatic event
405920	411840	which is why, you know, it goes on to the rest of psychoanalysis, repression, whatnot, hysteria.
413440	419200	Therefore, I see anxiety in the same way. I see it as not something to be killed,
420400	426720	despite, due to our own peril in my opinion, we've overtly medicalized it, but that's a whole
426720	432560	other topic and in fact, it's a podcast that I'm going to do soon. I'm currently writing the script
432560	440080	because it's a sensitive topic for many people. I want to be punctilious and I would say more
440080	446720	respectful as to how I do it. Getting back to the essay, despite being encompassing non-being
446720	453520	and the impossibility of a jettisoning existential anxiety, lying exacerbates the looming threat
453520	460480	of non-being and make one's constitutive ontic anxiety pathological. You're aware of that's
460480	466240	actuality. That at one arbitrary point in life, everything culminates in a nothingness.
466960	472960	Despite you not knowing what this nothing truly entails, you have intimations of its eminence
473680	481520	and yet you can cope with death. But if you lie and deceive in your finite existence, not only does
481520	488160	death verge upon you insufferably, but your life becomes so agonizingly hellish that you'd wish
488160	495600	you were dead already. This means we identify a lie or truth best not by the cognizance of
495600	501200	correspondence or objective facts, the way a theoretician or a scientist would do with a given
501200	508480	problem, but primarily by being attentive to one's inner thoughts, emotions and psychic states when
508480	514400	ushering or writing something. In that vein, metaphysically speaking, if the universe is made
514880	522320	up of facts, the trueness or falseness of a fact necessitates a human being who are designed to use
522320	530160	how to give into terminology to come to being. Case in point, Martin Luther, the father of the
530160	537280	Protestant Reformation, was a little known priest in 1517. This was until he famously hammered his
537280	544480	95 pieces onto the doors of Old Saints Church in the border town of Wittenberg, Saxony, modern-day
544480	551280	Germany, subsequently stirring up a storm across a whole of Europe and eventually every corner of
551280	558640	the world. His list began the ongoing dissension between the hegemony of the Roman Catholic Church
558640	565360	and its opponents, colloquially known as the Protestants, and secularly precipitated leftism.
565440	570320	This is true, I believe that Martin Luther was pretty much the first leftist. I'll start that
570320	576880	sentence from the top, and secularly precipitated leftism, anti-statism and modernity as a whole.
577680	582480	One could argue that many momentous historical revolutions and social movements,
583520	590080	from the French Revolution to the civil rights movement, could be pointed to this ostensibly
590080	595200	simple act by Luther, which he intended only to start an academic debate.
596320	604320	At the time, the absolute theocratic authority of the Church led to Luther's excommunication
604320	611600	by Pope Leo X, and he was called to the diet of worms, a formal deliberative assembly,
612320	618960	and demanded to recant his heretical statements over risk being burnt at the stake. In his
618960	625120	intransigency, notwithstanding the risk of dying a brutal death, he famously responded,
626240	631680	my conscience is captive to the word of God, thus I cannot and will not recant,
632720	639600	because acting against one's conscience is neither safe nor sound. Here I stand, I can do no other,
639600	645760	God help me. Since we live in secular times and are detached from a pre-reform society,
645760	651440	we can't understand the significance of Luther's actions. No reading of history will
651440	656960	help us realize the radical change he set forth in humanity. However, we all have our own
656960	663120	distinctive moments of here I stand, I can do no other. Luther believed to have found
663120	671040	metaphysical truths about being, of course, perhaps I will not, perhaps if I rewrote this,
671040	677040	I would probably have not put the word metaphysical in there, because after reading Heidegger,
677040	681920	I'm beginning to question the whole project of metaphysics itself, so I don't know if
681920	689120	Luther really was talking about metaphysical truths in that sense, so I would just leave it as
689120	694960	Luther believed to have found truths about being. Okay, back to the essay. But all he had to stand
694960	702080	by was his conscience, not an objective theory of any kind. His only way to discern truth from
702080	707840	untruth was solely himself. If he recanted his statements, he would be telling the greatest
707840	714960	of lies by defining his conscience. This he couldn't live with, which is why he can do no other.
714960	720240	You and I have very little in common with Luther except for this phenomenon of being,
720320	724080	creatures with an inescapable, idiosyncratic conscience.
724880	730480	Leaving aside obstruous metaphysics and ontology, in our daily lives, in certain immediate
730480	737600	particularities, we find truths above truth, but ourselves and conceivably the largest structural
737600	744640	whole of reality itself. So we ought to pay attention to our lives with the utmost rigor.
745200	751120	A lie is more than asserting an unfactual statement, because it's not withstanding
751920	758240	machinations to obfuscate and masquerade lies as truth, even if we convince everyone to accept
758240	765120	a lie as being true, when one lies, one knows. And to make matters worse, we are also self-deceiving.
765680	771840	We must stop fooling ourselves into thinking that our emphatical will is the will to an
771840	778640	unprejudiced truth, far from it. Kierkegaard, in his oblique characteristic Mao, was a
778640	784080	philosopher who expounded best on finite man's susceptibility to self-deception.
784880	790960	For instance, he was highly skeptical of Aristotelian virtue ethics and moral philosophy.
791600	797920	A Kierkegaardian would find living man as solely a rational creature of moral reasoning to be
798480	802560	unduly naive about the human capacity for radical evil.
802560	810000	Despite at times its spuriousness and unreliability, the findings of psychoanalysis tell us that we
810000	816720	cannot acontextually and abstractly follow an objective morality. Even when we think we are
816720	823360	doing so, it could be self-deception. Comprehending this datum doesn't necessarily require reading
823360	828960	the labyrinth of existentialism and moral philosophy, although we all ought to. Rather,
828960	836400	being attentive to ourselves will suffice. Recall the last time you unequivocally knew
836400	841600	you were doing something wrong, not new in the sense of knowing some historical fact or political
841600	849280	theory that it would regurgitate to sound smart, but you felt a pang of profound guilt and visceral
849280	855440	disgust towards yourself for a certain act. Amidst the moment, you hated who you were and couldn't
855440	862640	relieve your conscience of this psychospiritual distress. At such times, most of us who would
862640	868720	justify our subjective shortcomings that are supposed to be on par with our personal telos
869360	876320	would conjure up any reason to tell ourselves we are not at fault, our intent was good or there
876320	883680	was no real harm done, etc. And who could blame us? Life is hard and occasionally, perhaps always,
883680	891840	out of pure pragmatism similar to cypher in the matrix, we choose to live in convenient lies
891840	900960	as ignorance is bliss for most of us. In many ways, Nietzsche completed Kedricat's
900960	907040	essentialism by hammering home the point that even our conscious decisions and social structures
907040	913920	we're put in, for example, the revealed scientific institutions aren't oriented towards uppercase
913920	924160	T truth. Nietzsche writes, even scientific inquiry itself, our science indeed, what does
924160	930720	all scientific inquiry in general mean, considered as a symptom of life? What is the point of all
930720	937200	that science and even more serious, where did it come from? What about that? Is scientific scholarship
937200	945040	perhaps only a fear and an excuse in the face of pessimism? A delicate self-defense against
945040	951360	the truth? And speaking morally, sometimes like cowardice and falsehood, speaking un morally,
951360	957440	a clever trick. Oh Socrates, Socrates, was that perhaps your secret or your secretive
957440	966160	ironness? Was that perhaps your irony? Gosh, I can never get over and not ever fall in love with
966160	971120	Nietzsche's prose. It's just bizarre. I can't believe he writes like that. So what does it mean
971120	977520	to be an authentic and truthful writer in this utter confusion of existence? It's someone who
977520	984080	doesn't write bullshit. Unlike a liar who might at least have the pretense of being concerned for
984080	991200	the truth, Harry G. Frankfurt expounds that bullshit is speech or writing by a bullshit artist
991200	998880	without any regard for truth at all. Instead, he is predominantly aiming to be solely persuasive
1000240	1005040	and change a listener or reader without convincing someone that something is true.
1005760	1012640	It's even done unconsciously as Frankfurt elucidates in his paper. Our natures are indeed
1012640	1019680	elusively insubstantial, notoriously less stable and less inherent than the natures of other things.
1020720	1028240	And in so far as this is the case, sincerity itself is bullshit. Ergo, we ought to never confuse
1028240	1035680	our sensible authenticity in speaking or writing as being truthful. Sincerity itself could be a tool
1035680	1042800	used for deception. One can never truly know if one is being truthful. Much like love,
1042800	1048960	truth is an article of faith. One falls into it and thereafter decides to pursue it. Pause,
1048960	1055120	just a point here. When I mean one falls into it, I certainly don't mean it's a complete arbitrary
1055120	1062240	chaotic random event. You know, finding truth or falling in love. For both to happen, to find
1062240	1067840	truth and even to fall in love, I believe we have to, as a subject, orient ourselves towards
1067840	1073280	the fall, so to speak. And I'm going to write about this in the future. Once we fall, we have to
1073280	1080560	decide to be fallen. Therefore, it's not a mere chaotic irrational event completely out of our
1080560	1086720	control. We not very much, or ultimately perhaps, but in many ways we do have control at least
1086720	1093280	as to how we orient ourselves and as to how we are ready to find love or find truth.
1094080	1099200	Alright, back to the essay. Essentially speaking, which is the only way one ought to speak about
1099200	1106080	such matters, this is why truth is an orientation, as I had said before. The intent of an individual
1106080	1112640	and a state of being one chooses to embody rather than a destination, set of facts or propositions.
1113360	1119360	In that sense, one could make an unfactual statement due to their ignorance, but still not
1119360	1125920	be a liar, or bush it up, as he is still aiming at being a seeker of truth, notwithstanding
1125920	1132720	his proclivity to be fallible due to the sheer fact of being human. Of course, an outside observer
1132720	1138640	cannot empirically verify this, it's entirely left to one's conscience, so perhaps one should
1138720	1145520	be petrified of lying and striving to be an arbiter of truth. Sojournetsen was right when he wrote,
1145520	1151680	the simple step of a courageous individual is not to take part in the lie. Subjectivity is truth.
1152880	1156880	And this leads to one of the most contentious statements of this essay.
1157840	1169360	While I'll strive for objectivity, pause. I had to pause there and think, because I don't even
1169360	1175200	know what I mean as strive for objectivity, what that means. Perhaps the more apt term is
1176080	1183440	while I'll strive for a trans subjectivity, a common subjectivity, if that makes any sense at all,
1183440	1189440	because I'm commonly believed that we have no way of knowing what's objectively true.
1191600	1197520	It's something that just doesn't comprehend. It's not something that I can resonate with,
1198160	1203680	objective truth in that sense. All right, back to the essay. I don't want to over complicate this,
1203680	1206480	just want to, at least in some sense, stick to the essay.
1209760	1212720	I'll start again on that. I kind of screwed up that sentence.
1213440	1219680	So subjectivity is truth. And this leads to one of the most contentious statements of this essay.
1220640	1225440	While I'll strive for objectivity, I need to realize that for the type of being we are,
1225440	1231120	that is human and not God, subjectivity is true. In his trenchant critique of German
1231120	1238240	idealism and ardent emphasis on existence to be with an inwardness over abstract theorizing,
1238880	1243920	yet again, it was Kerkregat who expounds, and even introduced to the western mind, perhaps,
1244560	1248880	the notion of truth that matters above all other truths is the subjective one.
1248880	1253840	Sarat, of course, appropriated this project for a secular world with this atheistic
1253840	1260400	existentialism of radical freedom. I'm more a Kerkregadian than a Saratrian, as I'm a religious
1260400	1266800	Nietzschean. That is to say, God does not exist objectively, but purely subjectively. And what
1266800	1272320	matters is not the afterlife, but the present one. Therefore, I'll write through the lens of
1272320	1280960	subjective truth and be primarily concerned with subjectivity. Kerkregat writes in concluding
1280960	1288480	unscientific postscript, Christianity protests against every form of objectivity. He desires
1288480	1294880	that the subject should be infinitely concerned about himself. It is with subjectivity that
1294960	1301760	Christianity is concerned, and it is only in subjectively that its truth exists. If it exists
1301760	1310720	at all, objectively, Christianity has absolutely no existence. If the truth happens to be only in
1310720	1317760	a single subject, it exists in him alone. And there is greater Christian joy in heaven over
1317760	1324080	this one individual than over universal history or the system. I like that last bit because he's
1325200	1334640	sort of mocking Hegel there. For him, God is a subject and therefore requires a subject-to-subject
1334640	1342080	relation. Of course, I'm not sure if that's true. I know, I thought that was the case when I wrote it,
1342080	1347360	but after reading Paul Tillich, who was also influenced by Kerkregat, I'm not sure if Kerkregat
1347360	1355280	believed God was just a subject or if God transcends the object-subject binary. Tillich thinks
1355840	1360480	that certainly to be the case, he believes God does transcend that binary, and so do I.
1361520	1366160	So I need to take that sentence with a grain of salt because I'm not sure if that's true.
1368800	1375360	Back to the essay. This is why old religious scripture discloses truth, not systems to us
1375360	1382160	subjects. Similarly, this idea could be secularly reappropriated for our ordinary life,
1382800	1389360	which entails being subjective and dealing with other subjects, and unsurprisingly when people
1389360	1395360	are treated any differently, it infuriates them. For instance, a feminist has right to say the
1395360	1402240	objectification of women is wrong, but ironically, this so-called objectification is a subjective
1402320	1407840	passion of, let's say, male chauvinism. So nonetheless, it's a subject-to-subject relation.
1408720	1414560	We cannot escape subjectivity. Perhaps if I wrote purely about the objective natural sciences,
1415280	1421200	this statement might not wholly apply. That too is questionable since it's us who do the science.
1421840	1427680	In any case, since the unhappy man is about the individual, there's no decoupling or universalizing
1427680	1433440	the human experience from it. And subjectivity is what it ultimately means to be a human being,
1433440	1439760	banan. Such as why Sartre rightly argued against Freud's empirical psychoanalysis
1439760	1445680	that attempts to schematize a human mind via a collection of observations. For Sartre,
1445680	1451600	the psyche is irreducible. Ergo, I am deeply skeptical of psychometrics that attempts to
1451600	1457200	prescribe identities to individuals through its lust for categorizing, for example,
1457200	1463280	gender differences. A cognitive scientist could study the qualia, qualities of the world as perceived
1463280	1469920	and experienced by us, of a human subject experiencing the color red, a footy game,
1469920	1478240	or Tchaikovsky's piano concerto number one, Opus 23, and analyze the subject's brain waves,
1478240	1485120	heart rate, facial expressions, etc. And convince himself he has an empirical objective,
1485120	1490960	even ontological understanding of a person. But it'll be a great act of self-deception
1490960	1497520	and scientific malady to presume he precisely knows what an individual, or the subject he's
1497520	1503440	studying in particular, is experiencing in a way that his findings could replace the actual human
1503440	1510560	being. A psychometrition could categorize human beings into the taxonomy of personality traits
1510560	1518480	such as the big five at infinitum, but never settle on what the actual existence of an individual
1518480	1525600	entails, which is why those traits are an ever-growing enumeration. And of course, no Shakespearean
1525600	1531920	sonnet, no matter how breathtakingly poetic, will truly capture what it means for you and me
1532480	1540080	to fall in love. In essence, every human being is the eternal distinction in reality, because
1540080	1548080	the individual who has become is to be and is becoming will have a life no one or thing ever will.
1549040	1555120	In that sense, the only verity we can be sure of is that we are all eternally lonely in this world.
1555600	1563040	The synagogue for writing on human experience is the epistemic humility to know that I will invariably
1563040	1570400	fail at tapping into a person's subjective truth, and will only be able to delineate my subjectivity,
1570400	1577440	at least that which is effable. Therefore, I write at the risk of being utterly nonsensical,
1577440	1583040	and to be an authentic writer is to accept that writing will never fully encompass
1583040	1591200	existence, specifically that of a soul reader. In that vein, to write well is to know the limits of writing.
