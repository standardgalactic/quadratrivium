0	6720	Hey everyone, today we're going to discuss the idea of Bodum using the existential theories of the philosopher Soren Kerkregard,
6720	13640	and particularly on what he's delineated in his book, Eitheror, which some would argue is his magnum opus.
13640	22240	Also, sorry about the background noise, someone's mowing their lawn, just when I decided to record a video.
22240	24680	But firstly, let me read something from the book.
24680	29960	So here, Kerkregard is writing as the esteem, and I'll get into what that means in a bit.
29960	32240	He says this,
59960	66200	By pressing the speed to the maximum, one need only say to oneself,
66200	69400	Bodum is a root of all evil.
69400	76040	Strange that Bodum, so still and static, should have such power to set things in motion.
76040	84360	The effect that Bodum exercises is altogether magical, except that it is not one of attraction, but of repulsion.
84360	92720	So firstly, starting off this section of Eitheror, you could see clearly Kerkregard's esteem is no fan of Bodum.
92720	96600	He literally states that we're repelled by it.
96600	102720	But it's important to understand this before we get to exploring this idea of Bodum via the lens of Kerkregard,
102720	109000	is that this is particularly not what Kerkregard believes, and that's really important.
109000	112800	Because this, in my opinion, is what makes Kerkregard a brilliant philosopher.
112800	116320	You never really truly know what his beliefs are.
116320	122160	He delineates and outlines different kinds of existential theories.
122160	132720	And the esteem, the person who wants to live the aesthetic life, I think is in a rather uncanny way pertinent to our times.
132720	137400	I wouldn't say uncanny is the proper word, but in a rather interesting way, pertinent to our times,
137400	141720	because I'd postulate that in many ways, aren't we all esthetes?
141720	151520	As in, Kerkregard's esteem is a person who constantly pursues happiness and novelty that they constantly want to be titillated.
151520	153280	Isn't that modern society?
153280	159680	If you think of society, and to use a term that I heard from, in fact, I'm a Ewan,
159680	165600	society itself has this meta-aim, contemporary society, and that meta-aim tends to be happiness.
165600	169040	So if you go to a person and ask, why do you work?
169040	170400	You could say, I'm working for money.
170400	172200	And then you ask, why do you want to make money?
172200	174800	Or I'm making, I want to make money to be financially free.
174800	180120	Or I want to, you know, for starters, most people, unfortunately, would say, I'm making money just to survive.
180120	185040	And that's the harsh, crude reality of the world we live in.
185040	186560	People simply want to get by.
186560	194320	But at the same time, let's say people that are a bit more well-off, a bit more middle-class, a bit more bourgeois.
194320	198640	If you keep questioning what the purpose of what they're doing is, at one point,
198640	199880	what happiness comes up.
199880	201320	I'm making money to be more happy.
201320	206480	I'm making more money to travel the world, experience new things, have novelty.
206480	209120	And for Kierkegaard, this is the esteem.
209120	214040	Now, he doesn't place any moral judgment on being an esteem.
214040	222280	It's simply, again, as I kind of touched on before, is a mode of life, an existential mode of life, a state of being.
222280	236160	And the esteem constantly pursues the new thing, be it sex, be it women, be it flirting, be it money, be it alcohol, drugs,
236160	241040	or on the other side, what some would call high culture, intellectual work.
241040	250160	What I'm doing right now is, in some ways, an aesthetic act, or beauty and art, or classical music,
250160	255120	or indulge oneself in being titillated by such things.
255120	259720	Nevertheless, it's still taking real pleasure in the aesthetic life.
259720	260720	And that's what the esteem is.
260720	269640	And I think, for our times, again, to not to repeat myself, the esteem's mode of living is germane.
269640	271720	But here's the way I bring in Zhezhek.
271720	277280	It's not just that we are esteem because we spontaneously, deep in our covenants and authentic sense,
277280	280040	want to be an estate, that this is the kind of aesthetic life.
280040	289840	Rather, in many ways, the moral imperative, the injunction by society is to enjoy, to live your best life.
289840	300000	And two ways of thinking about it is the typical kind of crude 1960s madmen style, where, oh, it's about sex, drugs, money, women.
300000	304760	It's just being the typical consumer, making more money so it can consume more.
304840	309680	That's the very crude way that we kind of think of how consumerism, for instance, works.
309680	317000	Buy this thing, buy this product, and that'll fulfill your desires, that'll make you happy,
317000	320080	and keep going to the next one, to the next one, kind of like the Jay-Z's song.
325480	333040	But of course, the other side of the same coin is a bit more subtle, but the kind of new age aesthetic life,
333080	336000	self-actualization, live your best life.
336000	341280	People who obsess over self-help and productivity and mindfulness.
341280	344680	And I hate this term because it's really overused.
344680	345960	Well-being, well-being.
345960	348880	You hear Sam Harris types constantly talk about it.
348880	350400	It's important to meditate.
350400	356360	People obsess over listening to Andrew Huberman's, optimizing your health.
356360	362240	And then, of course, there's more of the positive psychology, which is like pop positive psychology.
362240	364800	Focus on being your best self.
364800	371080	And then the kind of new age, spiritualist type is divine, feminine, divine, masculine.
371080	377800	I'm one with the universe, which, unfortunately, in other words, the two-carrier way has a strain of fascism to it, too.
377800	385600	But all these things, all these things, the kind of crude consumerism and even the new age self-actualization,
385600	388480	I put it all on the umbrella of character-guards aesthetic life.
388480	391920	And if you read, so the book, either or, it's a dialectical book.
391920	401920	If you read the either, which is on the aesthetic, you'll see so much of what character-guards writing about in the 1840s remarkably applies to our times,
401920	409440	specifically our times, or especially our times, given the kind of stage of capitalism we are in right now.
409440	419960	And I'm not pointing or like blaming everything on capitalism in a way I kind of am, but a lot of our culture, the way we live,
419960	426080	it's influenced by the ideological impositions of neoliberal capitalism.
426080	428880	I'll leave it there, but it's a bit more complicated.
428880	433480	But I'll put it like this, and I think that's the point Ja'Jak makes.
433480	437080	He states that the super ego imperative is to enjoy.
437080	442160	The traditional notion of psychoanalysis is that because of some inner obstacles,
442160	448280	you internalized, identified excessively, excessively with paternal or other social prohibitions,
448280	454480	you cannot set yourself free to enjoy, to pleasure is not accessible for you.
454480	459480	It is accessible to you only in pathological forms of feeling guilty and so on.
459480	469160	So then the idea is psychoanalysis allows you to suspend, overcome these internalized prohibitions so that it enables you to enjoy.
469160	476760	The problem today is that the commandment of the ruling ideologies enjoy in different ways.
476760	484440	It can be sexual enjoyment, consumption, commodity enjoyment, up to spiritual enjoyment, realize yourself, whatever.
484440	493080	And I think that the problem today is not how to get rid of your inhibitions and to be able to spontaneously enjoy.
493080	496360	The problem is how to get rid of this injunction to enjoy.
496360	500120	So it's because of this super ego imperative that we have to enjoy.
500120	504040	In many ways, we are forced to be esthetes in the modern world.
504040	508240	If we need to understand what Kedrican means about the aesthetic life,
508240	513920	or particularly for this video, the idea of boredom and exploit via the aesthetic lens,
513920	519440	because again, I am beating on a dead horse here, we in many ways are all esthetes.
519440	522560	In the book, in this part of the book, he continues saying, he says,
522560	526520	OK, the quintessential example is to think of children.
526520	528440	We all think of children.
528440	530520	And what happens when children are bored?
530520	532480	They generally get up to no good.
532480	536120	You know, we hear terms of, you know, teenage illinquency,
536120	542800	or we see all these statistics, sociological statistics about when kids have nothing to do, they get up to no good.
542800	549520	And he says, this is a clear indicator that being boredom is repulsive.
549520	550440	It's not a good thing.
550440	555080	It's in fact the root of all evil as the esthetes writes as Kedrican.
555080	560640	I'm going to keep saying, as Kedrican writes, because it's kind of confusing to mix them together.
560640	565040	It's kind of something fun about reading Kedrican, because you never really know
565040	572960	which who he's writing as, because he's got so many synonyms and different ways of explaining existence.
572960	579880	And then he goes on by saying that, oh, look, the fact that children behave in such way
579880	583240	when they're bored is the reason that boredom is a problem.
583240	589880	And then he states, what wounded them that the world is regressing, that evil is gaining ground more and more,
589880	594280	since boredom is on the increase and boredom is a root of all evil.
594280	601760	And then with the stroke of genius, I would say, Kedrican predicts this pathological obsession we all have with being productive,
601760	609320	or with wanting to always be busy, which one would say is the ideology of productivism.
609320	612800	So I kind of touched on this a bit before.
612800	619600	I was talking about people like Andrew Huberman or all these, you know, the myriad self-help productivity gurus on YouTube.
619600	622240	And again, they have a place, a certain place.
622240	627880	But what happens is that what people apply to their lives to be more productive
627880	634840	or to try and kind of be a bit more efficient, the part replaces the whole.
634840	635880	That's all they become.
635880	637960	They all become people who need to optimize everything.
637960	644360	And it comes to a point where where everything, including things like love and family and intimacy,
644360	654920	all these things are viewed through the lens of productivism, ticking off boxes and making the most out of the time you have in for a day.
654920	659960	And for Kedrican, that is that is he kind of in a very sadonic way.
659960	663760	He mocks it and he says that that is not the way we humans are.
663840	672280	We humans, you know, are not machines and we don't have to constantly live this hyper productive, optimized life.
672280	675360	So he's very sadonic about it.
675360	679680	And he says something like this.
679680	686920	There are people with an extraordinary gift for transforming everything into a business whose whole life is business.
686920	695840	To fall in love and marry, listen to a joke and admire a work of art with the same zealous sense of affairs, which they work in the office.
695840	705320	Isn't that so interesting because I've recently been seeing on Twitter of people posting these long Google Docs, Google Docs or long Google Docs documents.
705320	706320	There we go.
706320	711280	Long Google Documents with sort of like checklists on reasons to date me.
711280	718400	So even love has become like a kind of business interaction or a business transaction.
718400	730000	And then of course, dating apps, dating apps is perhaps in our times the quintessential example of how we commodify other people and we kind of, you know, check the boxes and see our interactions become.
730000	744640	Yeah, again, at a very kind of a transactional level, the same way we go to the supermarket and buy, let's say, I don't know, some can of tuna and you got all these myriad options.
744640	746720	We treat other human beings the same way.
746720	748200	But of course, that's not how love works.
748200	751320	Love doesn't work where you pick the best from the rest.
751320	757400	It's rather it's in retrospect, you pick someone and then you make them the best from your own choice.
757400	758720	Hold on to the conversation.
758720	771400	But the point being, again, KKGOT sees how once we start living in a certain way where we repel boredom, we repel not making the best use of our time.
771400	781400	And we think that's kind of like a sin because, again, our moral injunction or the super ego commandment is to live your best life.
781400	783040	Then everything has to be optimized.
783040	786600	We all have to be pathologically obsessed with being productive.
786600	788360	And then he continues.
788360	791640	And here's where he's being a bit sadonic, which I love.
791640	793320	So all people are boring.
793320	796600	The word itself indicates the possibility of a subdivision.
796600	803160	Boring can describe a person who boasts others as well as one who boasts himself.
803160	809920	Those who both others are the general plebians, the mass, the endless strain of humanity in general.
809920	816200	Those who both themselves are the elect, the nobility, and how strange it is that, and I love this line,
816200	825200	how strange it is that those who don't bow themselves usually bow others, while those who bow themselves amuse others.
825200	831600	The people who do not bow themselves are generally those who are busy in the world, in one way or another.
831600	836600	But that is just why they are the most boring, the most insufferable of all.
836600	840800	And I thought that was really interesting because if you think about it, it's kind of like the argument.
840800	843200	In fact, I've got the book right here.
843200	853200	Makuza makes in his book One-Dimensional Man that when people become these kind of hyper-optimized, you know, productivity robots,
853200	855200	they in fact do become very one-dimensional.
855200	866200	All their life entails is a life of optimizing one's finances, optimizing one's time, living this very to-do-less space life.
866200	868200	And I am guilty as charged. I happen to be one of them.
868200	872200	In fact, I would say it's really interesting because I was with a girl for a while.
872200	881200	I was dating a girl for a few months and probably one reason we broke up was she was the opposite of me.
881200	883200	She was very good at relaxing and not doing anything.
883200	887200	So I think it certainly is a bit of a personality trait too.
887200	895200	Although I don't want to get into psychology and psychologize Kegelgaard's philosophy here, I think it's more of a cultural phenomenon where, yes,
895200	899200	we all have this desire, this yearning to constantly be productive.
899200	906200	And I think the point Kegelgaard makes here is that when all our life is treated like a business, as he's stated here,
906200	910200	then we kind of lose this spirit of what it means to be human.
910200	917200	We lose this kind of, I don't even know, in a way we stop being human.
917200	919200	We become an automaton.
919200	925200	And it's even an interesting Marxist critique of modern society.
925200	928200	People like that generally seem to be quite boring.
928200	934200	I find people who are hyper-obsessed with self-help the most boring, artificial people in the world
934200	938200	because it seems that everything in their life is architected, it's contrived,
938200	945200	and I find that to be, yes, as he writes, rather boring and insufferable.
946200	952200	But seeing all that, in the middle of this section, Kegelgaard takes a bit of a turn and he states this,
952200	958200	and afterwards I'll expand on what he means here, which at least my reading of what he's trying to state here.
958200	960200	He states,
961200	963200	It is usually said, is a root of all evil.
963200	966200	To prevent this evil, one recommends work.
966200	971200	However, it is easy to see from the remedy as well as the fear it caused,
971200	976200	that this whole view is of very plebeian extraction.
976200	980200	Idleness as such is by no means a root of evil.
980200	986200	Quite the contrary, it is a truly divine way of life, so long as one is not born.
987200	991200	Certainly, idleness may lead you to lose your fortune and so on,
991200	995200	but of such things, the man of noble nature has no fear.
995200	997200	What he fears is boredom.
997200	1000200	The Olympian gods were not bored.
1000200	1006200	They pondered in happy idleness, oh sorry, they prospered in happy idleness.
1006200	1013200	A beauty who neither soothes nor spends, nor irons nor reads, nor makes music as happy in her idleness,
1013200	1015200	for she is not bored.
1015200	1021200	So far from idleness being the root of all evil, rather it is the true good.
1021200	1026200	The root of all evil is boredom, and that is what must be kept at bay.
1026200	1028200	Idleness is not evil.
1028200	1032200	Indeed, one can say that any human who lacks appreciation of it,
1032200	1035200	proves that he has not raised himself to the level of humanity.
1035200	1040200	So at last line, I kind of was kind of what I was trying to articulate,
1040200	1045200	that in many ways, becoming this kind of one-dimensional person,
1045200	1048200	you lose a part of what it means to be human,
1048200	1053200	or you don't raise yourself to the level of humanity one could add.
1053200	1056200	Okay, so in the paragraph I read, what's Krikgad saying?
1056200	1060200	My reading is that, of course, as even Bertrand Russell,
1060200	1064200	who probably comes from a very different tradition, more of the analytical tradition states,
1064200	1066200	idleness is not a bad thing.
1066200	1069200	Idleness, in fact, is a good thing to be human.
1069200	1071200	We humans need a bit of idle time.
1071200	1076200	As perhaps Nietzsche said, old great ideas come to us when we are walking in walks.
1076200	1081200	So we need time that is just time spent without any, it's purposeless time.
1081200	1087200	It's time not, it's not resting so you could recuperate and do more work.
1087200	1092200	It's rather the subtle art of nothingness, of idleness.
1092200	1097200	And in fact, in modern society, as I've touched on, we simply don't have to be idle.
1097200	1102200	We simply don't have time to be idle anymore, although we are essentially both.
1102200	1106200	Now, I'll explain what I mean by essentially both a bit later,
1106200	1111200	because as we read this section, what you see is Krikgad delineates
1111200	1115200	that boredom is an ontological category.
1115200	1117200	It's intrinsic to being human.
1117200	1120200	We can't get rid of it.
1120200	1122200	We can't jettison it from our existence.
1122200	1123200	And that's the problem.
1123200	1129200	The problem is that since boredom, despite as he states, or the esteemed states,
1129200	1135200	is the root of all evil, despite that it still is a part of who we are.
1135200	1138200	We, in a very fundamental sense, are bored.
1138200	1144200	But while we are bored, we don't have time to be idle,
1144200	1149200	which Krikgad views, or the esteemed views as a virtue that idleness is a good thing.
1149200	1150200	I would agree.
1150200	1157200	Sometimes the most sublime ideas, the most sublime things happen when we are being idle.
1157200	1163200	It could even be a random interaction with a stranger that happens when we are really not getting up to anything
1163200	1166200	and not really rushing to the next thing or the next task.
1166200	1175200	But of course, the problem is because of our current societal ideology of be productive, be busy,
1175200	1180200	make the best use of your time, and then the other much more, I would say, dark side of things
1180200	1185200	where people simply don't have time to relax anymore as they simply have to put food on the table.
1185200	1189200	Just to get by, people are always working, taking multiple jobs.
1189200	1191200	Idleness is going away.
1191200	1197200	It's left our existence while we are also fundamentally bored.
1197200	1200200	There are subtle differences, but they are on the same thing.
1200200	1207200	Idleness is something at a very practical level that we need to incorporate into our lives,
1207200	1209200	whereas boredom, it is existential.
1209200	1212200	It's constitutive of what it means to be human.
1212200	1218200	In fact, in the book, it stated quite interestingly, we can trace this, so when he means this, he means boredom,
1218200	1220200	from the very beginning of the world.
1220200	1222200	The gods were bored, so they created man.
1222200	1226200	Adam was bored because he was alone, so Eve was created.
1226200	1232200	From that time, boredom entered the world and grew in exact proportion to the growth of the population.
1232200	1240200	Adam was bored alone, then Adam and Eve were bored in union, then Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel were bored on famil,
1240200	1245200	then the population increased, and the peoples were bored on mass.
1245200	1251200	So my reading of that little bit is that the estate is saying, despite him despising boredom,
1251200	1255200	despite him finding it repulsive, we can't get rid of it.
1255200	1258200	At least for the estate, it's kind of like a predicament.
1258200	1262200	It's not something we can just choose not to have in our lives.
1262200	1264200	It's a part of being human.
1264200	1272200	Then he states, this is the problem when we don't have time to be idle,
1272200	1275200	which is kind of like a practical thing being incorporated into our lives,
1275200	1278200	but we are still bored, it leads to meaninglessness.
1278200	1282200	I think that's where it becomes like a social phenomena,
1282200	1286200	where people have a mental health crisis as a term,
1286200	1293200	a neologism coined by social psychologists called deaths by despair.
1293200	1300200	It's simply people dying from unhappiness, not simply it's tragically people dying from unhappiness.
1300200	1307200	And for CricketGuard, one reason for this would be because we haven't acknowledged the fact that in the core of who we are,
1307200	1310200	in some sense this void of boredom, and it's there,
1310200	1313200	and he puts it beautifully here, he says,
1313200	1319200	boredom rests upon the nothingness that winds its way through existence, its diddiness,
1319200	1324200	like that which comes from gazing down into an infinite abyss, is infinite.
1324200	1330200	So you can see from that little line there how thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre were influenced by CricketGuard quite interestingly.
1330200	1336200	So we need to be able to acknowledge this boredom being a part of our ontological condition.
1337200	1340200	And then, and then what? And the question is then what?
1340200	1345200	Given the fact that yes, boredom, for the assiduous evil, and what do we do from there?
1345200	1352200	CricketGuard, for better or worse, and for my belief is that for better, he is not a self-op author,
1352200	1358200	so he doesn't really write prescriptive texts except perhaps as more of his religious writing.
1358200	1365200	The fact of the matter is there really isn't no remedy or panacea to the fact that boredom to the core is a part of who we are,
1365200	1370200	although one thing that helps in understanding that is that then we acknowledge it
1370200	1375200	and then we also understand that idleness per se isn't a bad thing.
1375200	1384200	And in fact, we should probably make time and not listen to the societal imperatives or societal injunctions
1384200	1387200	to constantly do something and allow ourselves to be idle.
1387200	1391200	But that doesn't mean any of that is prescriptive and that's not the purpose of this video either.
1391200	1393200	I don't give advice on this channel.
1394200	1403200	But to kind of end it on a let's say a positive note, what is the solution to this dilemma, this predicament we are in?
1403200	1409200	The fact that we are ontologically bored, it's innate to who we are and that we don't have time to be idle,
1409200	1415200	therefore we have this emptiness and void in the middle of our lives.
1415200	1419200	And what is the solution to compulsive pathological business?
1419200	1426200	Now, of course, look, I could give the typical self-advice or kind of discuss, you know, or take time,
1426200	1435200	have me time in your calendar, lock out me time, I don't know, meditate, go for walks, you know, partake in self-care things.
1435200	1437200	Those are great, do all of that.
1437200	1441200	I do most of those things, I exercise, I run, I don't meditate, I hate meditating,
1441200	1445200	but I do engage in these things because they're great.
1445200	1447200	It's important to take care of your health.
1447200	1451200	But for me, still, those are rather superficial things.
1451200	1459200	What I've found personally is that the kind of the remedy to, I wouldn't even call it a remedy, not the perfect remedy,
1459200	1466200	but what helps me cope with this existential dread, let's say, or this nappingness, this void of boredom,
1466200	1474200	is to deeply fall in love with the world, to deeply, not to do the whole Western Buddhist thing where you detach yourself from the world
1474200	1476200	and be like, oh, everything's a cosmic phenomenon.
1476200	1477200	No, no, no.
1477200	1482200	Attach yourself more to the world, care more about the world, and find something you deeply care about.
1482200	1486200	For me, it happens to be writing, philosophy, politics.
1486200	1494200	These are things that I would go to the ends of my existence to deeply go all the way in some sense.
1494200	1500200	And I think that's the only antidote to this boredom we have in existence.
1500200	1507200	It's not playing this middle game where you do a bit of everything, but rather finding something that's like an infinite passion
1507200	1515200	that takes you all the way to the end, to the point where, in fact, when you truly care about a certain vocation,
1515200	1522200	let's say, be it a scientist, a political activist, an engineer, an artist, a philosopher,
1522200	1526200	you would sacrifice your own world for that course, for the vocation.
1526200	1531200	If you're building something, if you're writing a book, if you're partaking in some kind of political movement,
1531200	1534200	especially, I would say, if you're partaking in some kind of political movement,
1534200	1543200	you would sacrifice your well-being, your happiness, which the estate would find that repulsive.
1543200	1545200	You would sacrifice all of that for the course.
1545200	1548200	And I think that is the only way to exist in this world.
1548200	1554200	It's not through taking this kind of middle ground and trying to optimize everything in your life.
1554200	1565200	I think that's a lie sold to us so that we can, in fact, be suckers and buy more things off the market.
1565200	1570200	And of course, for many people, this comes in the form of family.
1570200	1573200	That is certainly something you can commit yourself to.
1573200	1583200	But the point being, I don't think, I think the worst thing one could do with Bodum is to ignore it, repress it,
1583200	1595200	don't look into it, and just take on many things in life and just drown yourself with tasks or businesses to use a word credit card.
1595200	1602200	I don't mean business in the economic transactional sense, but rather in always doing things and not obviously be idle.
1602200	1606200	My view one should confront that Bodum is a part of who we are.
1606200	1609200	It's considerative to our existence.
1609200	1620200	And then, then kind of go all the way, go all the way, find something that will, that will, that will not just wake you up in the morning,
1620200	1626200	but even keep you up late at night to the point where it's in fact bad for you.
1626200	1628200	And I think that's where passion lies.
1628200	1638200	Passion, for me, much like Bodum, passion itself is a, it's a, it's a, it's what it means to be human.
1638200	1642200	You will achieve the level of humanity when you truly are passionate about something.
1642200	1644200	And at least that's what I believe.
1644200	1647200	But again, I'm not being prescriptive here.
1647200	1650200	I found that for me, that's the only way to live.
1650200	1651200	It's life of passion.
1651200	1652200	Thanks for watching.
1652200	1653200	Hope you found that useful.
1653200	1654200	Cheers.
