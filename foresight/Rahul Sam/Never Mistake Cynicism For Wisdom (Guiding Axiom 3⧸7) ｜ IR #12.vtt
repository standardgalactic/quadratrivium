00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the NRLN podcast.

00:04.160 --> 00:09.520
I shall continue what I've been doing in the previous episodes where I read out these guiding

00:09.520 --> 00:15.440
axioms that I laid down for my newsletter, The Unhappy Man, and in case you didn't watch the

00:15.440 --> 00:24.240
previous episodes to repeat the same old introduction, sort of ad nauseam, I laid down

00:24.320 --> 00:29.120
seven axioms for my writing for the newsletter and in the middle of it I realized, oh wow,

00:29.840 --> 00:35.360
what I'm writing here, it's not just for the newsletter, in fact it's sort of a framework for

00:35.360 --> 00:41.360
all of my creative work and this podcast certainly is a part of what I consider to be my creative

00:41.360 --> 00:46.960
work so it just makes sense to read out these axioms so that, you know, since the podcast just

00:46.960 --> 00:56.000
started and if you're a new variable listener, whatever you may be, you'll see where I'm coming at

00:56.000 --> 01:02.160
when I'm trying to produce content for the podcast, not just my monologues or my pieces,

01:04.640 --> 01:10.240
even the interviews I hope to do through the axioms that I've been laying down.

01:10.240 --> 01:16.400
And today's axiom is axiom number three. If you did miss the other two, please go and watch them.

01:16.480 --> 01:20.080
It's part of the playlist, it's all on the YouTube channel on Spotify.

01:21.040 --> 01:29.120
But without further ado, let's get started. The guiding axiom number three for the unhappy man,

01:29.120 --> 01:33.920
for the inner realm podcast, for all of my creative work is, and this is very, very important,

01:33.920 --> 01:38.640
I wrote this with a lot of passion, I would say. It's something that's very, very close to my heart.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.320
Never mistake cynicism for wisdom.

01:46.640 --> 01:52.000
In Dostoevsky's Kraman punishment, Raskolnikov has a point when he says,

01:52.960 --> 01:55.600
pain and suffering are always inevitable.

01:57.920 --> 02:04.720
For a large intelligence and a deep heart, the really great men must, I think, have a great sadness

02:04.720 --> 02:14.320
on earth. Perhaps it's true that men of higher intellectual acuity are more aware of the world's

02:14.320 --> 02:21.840
tragedy and folly. So their contempt for the deluded masses who are lost in superficial vanity

02:21.840 --> 02:28.080
and worldly self-indulgence probably has some warrant. But I wonder if those ancient critiques

02:28.080 --> 02:35.280
with their eruditeness and polemical virtuosity tend to fall in love with their own ingenious.

02:35.280 --> 02:41.120
In truth, the highbrows rarely believe about themselves what Socrates declared of himself.

02:42.160 --> 02:50.240
I neither know nor think I know. Most casual, critical philosophizing is merely one's

02:50.240 --> 02:54.800
cynicism being projected onto the world masquerading as wisdom.

02:55.520 --> 03:01.120
The only thing worse than a cynic is an accompanying sharp intellect to tantalize

03:01.120 --> 03:07.920
a cynicism. For instance, if we take happiness, something elusive for us humans, such a person

03:07.920 --> 03:15.200
refuses to believe that someone could be genuinely happy in this world, and is dismissive or even

03:15.200 --> 03:20.960
hates anyone trying to do so. Let's see a man who's sincerely endeavoring to make something of

03:21.920 --> 03:27.760
himself as merely a show, one puts on to please the cultural overlords,

03:27.760 --> 03:34.720
pusillanimously and slavishly living by an emasculating moral duty. For the cynic,

03:34.720 --> 03:41.600
the ordinary person, playing his part as a steadfast citizen, fulfilling his responsibilities

03:41.600 --> 03:47.040
towards his family, paying his dues to the divine, without overtly theologizing God,

03:47.040 --> 03:52.640
and maybe even volunteering at a homeless shelter once in a while is all but puppetry.

03:53.440 --> 03:59.680
The cynic sneers at all of this effort and says it's all futile and only for the credulous.

03:59.680 --> 04:06.320
They are in utter disbelief of sincerity and anyone striving towards the good. In their

04:06.320 --> 04:12.800
enlightenment state, they think of themselves as being beyond the trivialities of ordinary life and

04:12.800 --> 04:19.200
basic morality, despite being willing to even suffer for their cynical ideologies.

04:20.560 --> 04:25.840
But the irony is that a cynic is critical of everything and anything but their hubristic

04:25.840 --> 04:32.080
cynicism. The cynical attitude of the heart always comes first and the rationalization second.

04:32.640 --> 04:39.280
Whenever I encounter a cynic, which sometimes is someone I meet within my own soul, I'm reminded

04:39.280 --> 04:47.680
of what G.K. Chesterton wrote about the new rebel in orthodoxy. But the new rebel is a skeptic

04:47.680 --> 04:54.480
and will not entirely trust anything. He has no loyalty, therefore he can never be really a

04:54.480 --> 05:01.360
revolutionist. And the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants

05:01.360 --> 05:07.200
to denounce anything. For all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind,

05:07.840 --> 05:13.520
and the modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces, but the doctrine by

05:13.520 --> 05:20.640
which he denounces it. Thus he writes one book complaining that imperial oppression insults

05:20.640 --> 05:27.040
the purity of women and then he writes another book about the sex problem in which he insults it

05:27.040 --> 05:34.160
himself. He curses a sultan because christian girls lose their virginity and then curses

05:34.160 --> 05:41.120
Mrs. Grandi because they kept it. As a politician, he would cry out that war is a waste of life and

05:41.120 --> 05:48.320
then as a philosopher that all of life is a waste of time. A russian pessimist will denounce a policeman

05:48.320 --> 05:53.120
for killing a peasant and then proved by the highest philosophical principles that the peasant

05:53.120 --> 06:01.760
ought to have killed himself. A man denounces marriage as a lie and then denounces aristocratic

06:01.760 --> 06:07.600
profligates for treating it as a lie. He calls a flag a bubble and then blames the oppressors of

06:07.600 --> 06:14.000
poland or island because they take away that bubble. The man of this school goes first to a

06:14.000 --> 06:20.160
political meeting where he complains that savages are treated as if they were beasts, then he takes

06:20.160 --> 06:26.400
his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting where he proves that they practically

06:26.400 --> 06:34.480
are beasts. In short, the modern revolutionist being an infinite skeptic is always engaged

06:34.480 --> 06:43.360
in undermining his own minds. In his book on politics, he attacks men for trampling on morality.

06:43.360 --> 06:49.440
In his book on ethics, he attacks morality for trampling on men. Therefore, the modern man

06:49.440 --> 06:55.840
in revolt has practically become useless for all purposes of revolt. A rebelling against

06:55.840 --> 07:02.240
everything, he has lost a right to rebel against anything. So before I do read out my commentary

07:02.240 --> 07:08.480
on that paragraph, the good thing about doing a podcast is I can sort of impromptuly add notes

07:08.480 --> 07:14.560
and ancillary points to reading the essay. So think of this as more of a footnote. A lot of people

07:14.560 --> 07:20.240
think of Chesterton as being a typical orthodox conservative kind of thinker and theologian,

07:21.120 --> 07:28.240
but I wouldn't necessarily simplify him to that level. I think he's a much deeper,

07:28.240 --> 07:35.760
profound thinker than merely someone defending the orthodoxy. So in that spirit,

07:35.760 --> 07:42.480
I read him and in that spirit, I wrote this little bit as a commentary on what I just read.

07:43.200 --> 07:50.720
To explicate his sentiments, Chesterton writes not of his averseness or disdain of the

07:50.720 --> 07:59.040
revolutionary, but of the rebel who's a cynic, where his ideological affiliations merely a projection

07:59.760 --> 08:07.520
of an essential spiritual attitude. And the problem with the cynicism is that it becomes a lazy way

08:07.600 --> 08:13.840
to opt out of life. Echoing a more contemporary religious thinker, Jordan Pearson's sentiments,

08:14.720 --> 08:20.560
we're met with an ultimate outlook on life. Either everything wonders matters, which comes

08:20.560 --> 08:26.640
with the concomitant and crushing burden of responsibility. The striving man chooses his

08:26.640 --> 08:33.840
path and recognizes that his striving, no matter how arduous and demanding, is meaningful and necessary.

08:34.800 --> 08:39.920
Or the other is nothing matters, therefore one refuses to partake in life.

08:41.200 --> 08:47.440
This man is super-seriously contemptuous of the striving man and his so-called higher virtues,

08:48.960 --> 08:54.400
which is too simple and naive. It's only a matter of time when such a person's cynicism

08:54.400 --> 09:01.760
becomes resentment and they've created hell for themselves. He'd say better to be a king in hell

09:01.760 --> 09:07.120
than a slave in heaven. Funnily enough, I've begun to notice the latter type in the more cerebral

09:07.120 --> 09:13.840
intellectual types. But that's a whole other conversation. In any case, existential apathy

09:13.840 --> 09:20.160
and resignation cannot be a mere negation because being, which we all in escapably are,

09:21.040 --> 09:24.320
requires the void to be filled with something meaningful.

09:24.320 --> 09:32.640
Free will itself is mostly a curse, as one does not look into the niche in abyss.

09:38.480 --> 09:43.600
But the infinite boundlessness of one's possibilities, which Kierkegaard called

09:43.600 --> 09:49.920
the dizziness of freedom that everyone confronts in life when we are met with freedom's

09:49.920 --> 09:56.640
actuality as the possibility of possibility. This is why the philosophers try to convince

09:56.640 --> 10:02.240
themselves that men are not free. Most of us are petrified of truly being free.

10:03.600 --> 10:10.560
I do believe that. Having said that, I'm not as optimistic as Peterson or any other run-of-the-mill

10:10.560 --> 10:16.960
conservative. Unequivocally adopting responsibility, much like the striving man Ipsofacto, cannot be

10:16.960 --> 10:23.920
the antidote to rescue one from the gazing abyss or the dizziness imbued by the endless possibility

10:23.920 --> 10:33.040
of possibility. I could see how most of us modern humans could be a Joseph K. or a Gregor Samsa

10:33.040 --> 10:40.000
stuck in a Kafkaesque nightmare, lost in triviality and vanity, doing meaningless alienating work,

10:40.960 --> 10:48.160
knowing very well our life entails nothingness, but refusing to unshackle ourselves from the

10:48.160 --> 10:57.360
ideological chains as freedom hurts. Kafka himself wrote, I'm in chains, don't touch my chains.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.560
Yeah, that paragraph clearly is my Marxist side. I think the conservatives are way too optimistic

11:04.560 --> 11:10.640
and to some sense even naive about this question of meaning. In any case, the final paragraph.

11:12.080 --> 11:20.320
Ergo, in typical absurdist fashion, I go even a step further from my previous claim of humans being

11:20.320 --> 11:26.720
lousy at being happy to conclude that we're equally or even lousier at finding meaning,

11:26.720 --> 11:33.360
despite being the only beings in the universe that yearns for it desperately. The predominant

11:33.440 --> 11:40.640
ideologies and modes of being prescribed to us by the wisest of men, stoicism, revolt or rebellion,

11:42.000 --> 11:49.360
adopting responsibility, piety, cosmic resignation, sartrean, radical freedom, the postmodern notion

11:49.360 --> 11:57.040
of existence, perceived essence, etc. are inadequate for the human heart. While there are

11:57.120 --> 12:03.600
pronounced ways to be unhappy, miserable, loveless and meaningless in life, there's no ideal

12:04.960 --> 12:12.880
predestined way to be happy, content and living meaningfully. In that case, I have no choice but

12:12.880 --> 12:19.600
to be wholeheartedly happy for the happiness of another, even though it may seem ludicrous to me.

12:20.560 --> 12:26.960
I ought to never assume someone's happiness is a sign of inauthenticity or God forbid naivety.

12:27.600 --> 12:35.920
And indeed, this means never to mistake my cynicism for wisdom. And in this podcast,

12:35.920 --> 12:43.680
I shall always strive to never, ever make that mistake. Thanks for watching. Cheers.
