0	6720	Simon, you claim that philosophy does not begin in an experience of wonder as ancient tradition
6720	14640	contends, but rather, I think, with the indeterminate but palpable sense that something desired has not
14640	22480	been fulfilled, that a fantastic effort has failed. Philosophy begins in disappointment. It's one of
22480	30160	your famous lines, I think. Firstly, would you want to comment on this excerpt, but also,
30160	35040	perhaps, elucidate on what you mean by philosophy begins in disappointment?
36080	40320	Why is the world wonderful or is the world disappointing?
41920	43680	More the latter, isn't it?
44400	57600	Oh, right. If philosophy is thinking, is it time in thought, then we have to begin from
57600	67520	disappointment, it seems to me. It's a good way of making a contrast with a view which is
68480	77520	it's just a popular view, the idea of wonder, because it sounds cool, but if you look at the
78160	86960	sources for it, it's a view that Aristotle ascribes to those people that came way before him,
86960	96000	the physiologi, philosophers of nature. He thought they experienced wonder in relationship to
96000	103280	nature, but Aristotle doesn't claim that he experienced his wonder. It's a view that was
103280	112960	already out of fashion by the time of the fifth century BC. The idea there is that the modern
112960	119360	world is most certainly an experience of disappointment, and that's where you have to begin.
119360	128240	It's not where you end, so people often get, are you the disappointment guy? No,
128240	133200	philosophy begins in disappointment, it doesn't end in disappointment. Well, that's where it begins.
137920	142480	I don't say as much these days as I used to, but I still think it's right.
143200	152240	Yeah, indeed. Do you think that there's a very apocal way of thinking, I guess, but
152800	158880	that in terms of times when philosophy becomes most pertinent, for instance,
159840	167440	Jacques, who you've written polemics with, he claims that now we live in this time where these
167440	172880	grand metaphysical questions are coming back into our culture, kind of like the time that,
172880	180000	let's say, the German idealist went through, or do you think that there are these periods in human
180000	188480	history where philosophy becomes most pertinent, or that it's more ahistorical or acontextual as to
189440	194560	how philosophical development or progress, if you could call that, takes place?
195200	203680	Good question, very difficult question to answer. It's hard to find progress in philosophy,
205520	211280	the questions that we're asking are the same questions that the Plato and Aristotle asked,
211280	219280	so we don't have answers for them, so you might want to say philosophy is a series of perennial
220240	225520	questions without answers, and that's a good way of thinking about it. Philosophy is a movement
225520	238400	into perplexity about basic issues, and sophistry or ideology always claims to have an answer.
238960	247200	This is what this means, this is this, and so on and so forth, so if you claim to know, then you are
248160	256720	selling something, you're selling snake oil or whatever it might be, so one way of looking
256720	263360	is that philosophy really exhibits their progress over thousands of years, and then it's also where
263360	269360	do you even say it begins? Does it begin with the Greeks? Does it begin with? I think you lost
269360	273760	you there for a bit, Simon. Yeah, I think that was at my end, that something happens in this building
273760	283120	I'm in, that only happens during business hours, but normally by this time it's pretty, so anyway,
283120	291040	but I've got another Wi-Fi. Oh, great, right now, that's all fine. After doing podcasts for almost
291040	295120	two years with people all over the world, I'm kind of used to this now, so it's totally fine.
296480	300960	So we might get another breakage like that. Anyway, I was saying, so philosophy exhibits
300960	308000	no progress on fundamental issues, we could say, and then it's a question of opinion really, I mean
308000	318560	it's anybody that claims to have some special insight into this is lying. There does seem to be a
318560	326960	connection between, I mean, philosophy seems to be particularly creative at sudden critical
326960	337600	points in history, so we can think about, you know, the 13th century and the rise of scholasticism
337600	343760	and that, which comes out of that, that confluence of thinking in the Arabic world,
344720	352800	Greek thinking in the Arabic world, and then that finding its feet in Paris and Bologna and the
352800	358240	beginnings of universities and that, or you could say the 17th century, the rise of the scientific
358240	369280	view of things, which is also a period of intense conflicts, war, and we could, if we look at the
369280	379200	20th century, there's no doubt that, I mean, the first and second world wars were not great,
380160	388240	but they did provide stimulus for philosophical thinking, and which itself is quite interesting,
388240	397120	first world war, you get Wittgenstein, Rosenzweig, Lukacs, Heidegger for sure, and the second world
397120	403840	war really produces generations of philosophers that are really, you know, doing high-level
403840	412000	interesting work. Where are we now? I don't know, I think there's a renewed interest in philosophy,
412000	418480	and, you know, I've been trying to help that along in my little way over the years, but it's,
420880	427520	and in many ways the, in a way, the internet has been kind to philosophy in the way that it's been
428400	434240	unkind to the novel, which was the, you know, that was the cultural form that dominated the world
434240	442160	that I grew up in, people read novels, now they watch Netflix series, and maybe they've got some
442160	450720	space for short form, you know, short form blogs and articles and things like that, ideas which are
450720	459120	more easily digested, so perhaps it's a, it's a good time for philosophy, but it's not a good time
459120	467360	institutionally, and philosophy is, you know, there are two different views of philosophy, one view is
467360	473680	that, you know, philosophy is just thinking, and it can take place anywhere, and philosophy should
473680	479920	be in the streets, and that's fine, and that goes all the way back to the cynics, and, you know,
479920	487200	thinking in public in ancient Greece, often without clothes on, masturbating and living in
487200	492000	barrels and doing crazy things, another view is that philosophy is something which has always
492000	499680	required an institutional framework, and that's, you know, that's what the academy was for Plato,
499680	505600	the Lyceum for Aristotle, and so on and so forth, so the institutional framework for the last
506240	512640	couple of hundred years has been the university, and is interesting philosophy coming out of
512640	518400	universities at this point, I don't think so, I really don't, there's a lot of smart people, but
518960	526240	not really much happening, so that would be one kind of half answer to that difficult question.
