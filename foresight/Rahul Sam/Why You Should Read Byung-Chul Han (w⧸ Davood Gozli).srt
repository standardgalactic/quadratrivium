1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this episode, I would emphasize for people who are new to Han, my kind of invitation would be

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:22,160
he is really great at connecting our very personal experiences, like the experience of being tired,

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,560
the experience of not having enough mental energy to do all the tasks that you're supposed to do.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,560
Our experiences of loneliness, being tired and alone at the end of the day.

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:46,560
And all these experiences, he pays attention to them and he connects them to broader patterns,

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:55,440
broader trends in culture, in society, in technology. And that is really valuable, I think.

7
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,200
He keeps, he doesn't keep the discussion of private experiences at that level, at that scope,

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,280
at that original scope of interest. Yes, of course, we're interested in it, but

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,800
he helps us make sense of it by putting it in a larger context and different contexts.

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,920
And with the help of different thinkers, he introduces us to a host of other valuable

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:30,720
thinkers like Foucault, Plato, Nietzsche, Arendt, Hannah Arendt, and he's very good at connecting

12
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,360
the moments in our thought, in a discussion with the right moments, the right person.

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,360
Hey, everyone. Welcome to my conversation with the cognitive psychologist,

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,000
writer, fellow bibliophile, and now someone who I can hopefully call my friend, Dr. Davood Gosley.

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,760
This certainly was a conversation that I expected to be amiable and good-natured,

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,080
and it certainly was. My expectations were met. I've been following Davood's book reviews for

17
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,960
about a year now, and I've thoroughly enjoyed them. And a couple of months ago, I noticed that he's

18
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,600
done a lot of reviews on Byung-Shul Han's work, and they were fantastic reviews. They weren't

19
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,280
mere cheap summaries where you'd quickly get across what the book says, but rather he critiqued them,

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,880
he discussed the ideas that spoke to him more deeply, and they always came from his point of

21
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,320
view, despite him reviewing the work of another thinker. And this got me thinking, perhaps I've

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,800
always wanted to do an episode or a podcast dedicated to exploring Byung-Shul Han, and I

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,760
thought Davood would be the perfect candidate to converse with. And I hope I was a good interlocutor

24
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,240
and brought up the best of both Davood and Byung-Shul Han's work, but you'd be the judge of that.

25
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,240
We spoke about a variety of topics. We discussed Davood's experience in academia, both it's

26
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,040
good and bad, perhaps mostly bad, unfortunately, and also some of the ideas of living in

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,480
neoliberal society and the logic of neoliberalism, and then explode some of the concepts that

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,160
Byung-Shul Han has introduced to the contemporary critical theory dialogue, let's say. But also,

29
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,040
in many ways, I was joking around during the episode, but I kind of meant in some sense too that,

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,600
sorry, I've got a bit of a cold, that I do want this episode to be some kind of propagandistic

31
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,080
conversation for you to go read the work of Byung-Shul Han, because I do think it can bring

32
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,280
great value to your life, especially in the society and culture we live in, where

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,120
a lot of the problems are made private and personalized when some of them really aren't

34
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,000
private in the first place. They are social problems. But we discussed this in detail during

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,400
the conversation, so I won't get into it right now. That being said, as I tend to do, a bit of a

36
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,040
formal introduction to Davood. Dr. Davood Gosley is a cognitive psychologist. He received his PhD

37
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,800
from the University of Toronto. He has held research and teaching positions at the University

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,680
of Vienna, Leiden University, and the University of Macau. He is the author of many scholarly articles

39
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,760
and a book titled Experimental Psychology and Human Agency. Dr. Gosley has a YouTube channel where

40
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,640
he posts book reviews panning a vast array of writers and genres from Heruki Murakami to Byung-Shul

41
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,200
Han and fiction to critical theory. He also runs a book club organized through his Patreon page.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,360
Having said that, here's my conversation with Dr. Davood Gosley, where we discuss the work of Byung-Shul

43
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,880
Han. It's really interesting. I think I subscribe more to kind of the Todd McGovern, in fact,

44
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,000
wrote a book about this, which I'll be talking to him soon. It's called Embracing Alienation.

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,560
And I find that I don't try to, like, at least personally, I don't let myself kind of be too

46
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,920
attached, overly attached to the kind of the socio-symbolic order of a certain culture. Like,

47
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,480
I don't really, despite being a dual citizen, just like in terms of formally, I don't really

48
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,880
think of myself as like a Sri Lankan Australian, or, you know, it's not something I attach myself

49
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,160
to too much. Certainly, my home is Australia, but yeah, don't get me wrong. I'm not like a hippie

50
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,160
that's like, oh, I'm a globalist. No, we need a home. I think, you know, we need a place that we

51
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:28,640
call home. But I guess to be succinct, I try to not think too much about, like, which culture am

52
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,440
I a part of? What's like my true, unique, you know, authentic culture? Because, as I think

53
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,880
Jacques puts as well, cultures themselves aren't authentic in themselves. They themselves have

54
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,000
this like, sure, ontological incompleteness, let's say. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes people go after

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,200
having a culture, they turn that into a project, expecting it to provide them with something,

56
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,760
something very stable and final, and help them get rid of that sense of alienation once and for

57
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,200
all. Yeah, yeah. If we turn that into that kind of turn it into that kind of project,

58
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I think that would be disappointing, ultimately. Yeah, because unfortunately, I don't know what

59
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,160
your thoughts on this, David, especially given you're much closer to the US than I am. I mean,

60
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,200
there's a there's a rise in nationalism, right? And I think a lot of them are looking for this,

61
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,720
the big other, the stable big other, and they want to fully attach themselves with it. And then

62
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:38,160
it's from there, they have this like, sense of stability, which, at least since modernity,

63
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,880
subjects have never had in the world. We like, Todd McGovern says that kind of the one sign of

64
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,680
modernity is that all subjects are alienated. We don't have a home in some sense. None of us

65
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:57,360
are rooted in a home. But yeah, I think I mean, Todd McGovern, I mean, I like him a lot, but what

66
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,840
does he know about being really alienated, living in a living in a place that nobody speaks his

67
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,440
language? I mean, sure, theoretically, I follow him to I follow him to but there's there are different

68
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:17,040
degrees of being out of place. Some of them are more visceral. I agree. Some of them are more like

69
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:24,400
you have to really think your way to them. But to be in a place and everybody's pointing at you

70
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,440
and saying, Oh, look at the foreigner, or is that is that foreigner going to stay here with us?

71
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,640
Yeah, that's that's like very in your face. And I since I've experienced that, I mean, that's

72
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,360
maybe that's not exactly what he's talking about. But maybe it is maybe it's like, you know,

73
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,480
I think I totally get your point there. Because like, I remember when I came here, when I was a

74
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,880
kid, much younger, even things like, I mean, I think Canada is okay. But like a lot like

75
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,600
Australian slang and colloquialisms, I was kind of like, what the hell are people talking about?

76
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,840
You know, and like, it's not even the direct judgment or the gaze of the others, just generally

77
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,800
me, myself, I'm trying to see where the hell do I fit in here. And then what I even the reason

78
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,200
Todd McGovern's work was really helpful was to be honest, I agree with you, I think there are like

79
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,280
certain limits, there's like, like, there are like, some of it can be a lot more palpable and

80
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,440
visceral was that because I realized, Oh, the trick is to kind of embrace your alienation to not like

81
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,960
to not as a not I don't try to this used to be the case where I tried to like overly attach

82
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,120
myself with a certain culture, be the Australian culture or the Sri Lankan culture, which is the

83
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,760
culture that my, you know, I was born and raised in. But I realized no, no, no, that's all of that

84
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,600
is fine. Like, I'm not, I'm not going to actively negate that side of me, of course, not that's

85
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,160
impossible. But also, I won't overly attach myself and be like, Oh, this is why I'm this is a true

86
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,480
core of my being. I like the whole kind of idea that in some sense, at the core, what we are is

87
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,000
like this kind of abyss or like a void. At least for me, being again, being a migrant, probably

88
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,400
that that's probably the reason I like that idea a lot more than trying to find like an

89
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,400
authentic kernel of who I am as a as a subject. Right, I see, I see. I feel like this is this

90
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,800
can be a this can be a long conversation, an ongoing conversation. Yeah, we can definitely

91
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,320
talk about this. Hopefully, we will be on with this. But I can, I can see how that could connect

92
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,600
to your interest in cognitive science as well, because that's tacitly cognitive science has that

93
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,400
attitude of not too much being attached to any particular culture. Interesting, what sense would

94
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,080
you say? It's a very non-culture in general, I think cognitive science, cognitive psychology has

95
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,840
a very non-cultural view of human nature, of a human being and human thinking. It kind of

96
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,920
brackets out the idiosyncratic, local, you know, regional practices, regional, I mean,

97
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:15,360
idioms of language. Everything becomes neat and formulaic and trans, maybe because you say

98
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:23,600
transparent, not these like interpretive, indirect, you know, a cognitive psychologist or

99
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:34,320
cognitive scientist doesn't necessarily, doesn't, I mean, habitually or typically pick out these

100
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:41,600
indirect communications, communication practices of cultures where you have to be immersed in a

101
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:49,680
culture to know how to decode a given sign, you know, that's what I mean. I see, I see, like it

102
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,920
tries to be like trans-cultural in some sense. Yes, yes, or beyond cultures. Yeah, no, I think

103
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,800
you're right, because like, in fact, I'm going to start my master's program next year, and it's

104
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:10,320
partially in cognitive science, like it's a research program. And I think I'm more, let's say,

105
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,800
I find more affinity with those kinds of studies, because something that also bothers me at the

106
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,960
Buddhist is kind of like, sometimes people get into this, like, they focus too much on, like,

107
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,000
the particularities, like other feminists or Marxists or black or white, and at one point,

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,240
that's very exhausting, you know, it's like, yeah, I get it, we all have particular identities,

109
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,240
but what about the universal? And that's why I'm more caught up in, like, I like the sciences,

110
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,240
because there is this kind of universalistic with that has its negatives too, for sure,

111
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,680
it's very absolutist. But I prefer that, I think you hit the nail on the head, that idea that

112
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,360
we can go beyond the particular into something a bit more universal.

113
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, what you said partly is cognitive science. The other part, is it philosophy?

114
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,240
It's philosophy, that's correct. Yeah, yeah. Okay, nice.

115
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,880
One by the department, but they have like, it's a very interesting program, like they,

116
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,040
they kind of intend them with some cognitive science fields. So I'm looking forward to it.

117
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,440
You're going for it. Yeah, man. I'm like, I, I, I kind of want to do what you did, you know,

118
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,560
go through the whole process, get my PhD, and then who knows, it might end up becoming a but not

119
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:29,120
academic, but I'm going to do it, regardless. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Good luck. Thank you, man. Thank

120
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,800
you. I might, in fact, I might come to you in the future for some advice. I hope I can.

121
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,440
No, I'd always be appreciative of that. But yeah, as I said, David, sorry for my, you know,

122
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,320
raspy voice. I'm getting over a cold. I'm telling you it's not. You sound, you sound fine. You sound

123
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,800
great. Perfect. Thank you, man. Yeah, look, so what we kind of are hoping to do today is to discuss

124
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,280
Bianchel Han's work and sort of let's do it in some sense, the propagandize as to why you should

125
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:07,680
read Bianchel Han. But before that, David, I thought a rather pertinent question would be,

126
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:15,200
my God, you've got over 400, I think, book reviews, probably a couple hundred on our YouTube channel,

127
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,680
and you're an avid reader. And from different genres, certainly. But I want to ask you a question,

128
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:32,400
which I think a lot of ink has been spilt over, which is how does one read philosophy and theory

129
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:45,040
well? You know, Rahul, in general, I am, I find it very difficult to adopt that perspective,

130
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,800
adopt that position of how does one do this and that. I know it's very attractive to go

131
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:59,120
for that perspective and formulate a kind of advice, generalities, general guidelines.

132
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,160
I can talk, I find it easier to talk about the things that I have,

133
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,280
I have kind of slowly settled into the kind of perspective I've settled into and maybe the

134
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,360
what I would say to myself, to my past self, maybe 10 years ago. In fact, in fact, I know

135
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,680
that you're not the advice giving type in any way, but perhaps that's a better way to

136
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:33,200
say what would you say to your past self. But there is that, that temptation to give advice

137
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,480
and ask for advice, both are very strong. And it's the, it's a temptation to be, to take a,

138
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,000
to, to help the other person save some time. You know, I really want other people to not go

139
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
through this inefficient process that I went through. But that's my mistake when I give to

140
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,600
that, give into that temptation, because everybody needs to go through their own inefficient process,

141
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,640
their own inefficient journeys, they own, they own, they own set of wrong books, the books that

142
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:10,400
they will later be embarrassed to admit that they liked, they enjoyed. Okay, so back to the question,

143
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:17,840
see if I can retrieve it, if I can remember it. How does one read philosophy? I mean, literally.

144
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:31,760
Slowly, you know, slowly without rush, trying to not do too much. I always have this. I mean,

145
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,240
I had it more, like, I just as to pick one example, the person that you read, one of the people you

146
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:46,400
recently interviewed that I really admire, Simon Krishly. I have, when I become interested in somebody

147
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,160
like, let's say Krishly, I was like, okay, here's a list of all Simon Krishly books. I'm going to

148
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,240
start chronologically from beginning to the end, and read them all. And see, read all the other

149
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,600
people that he was influenced by. And okay, if I replicate that whole process, what's going to

150
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,600
happen? I will catch up to Simon Krishly. Okay, that's like, by that time, I'm like seven years

151
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,400
old or something, or something, some age like that. I've tried to replicate Simon Krishly's

152
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:23,280
reading and writing life. I mean, that's not a practical thing to do. And I don't think it's

153
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:32,000
very useful. It's better to be, to accept that maybe I'll read one or two books by this thinker.

154
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,960
And by the time I'm finished with the second book, maybe I'm too busy with some of their

155
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,520
projects, some of the tasks, maybe my life will be interrupted by some facts of life,

156
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:51,040
maybe ill health or, you know, losing a job or whatever. And then, when I get back to philosophy,

157
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,480
I'm interested in some other topic or some other, some other thinker. So embracing all those

158
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,040
limitations, all those, the negativity of the reading life, to borrow Byung-chohan's

159
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:10,640
and others, Byung-chohan really brought this back and urged us to think in terms of negativity,

160
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:18,240
to embrace that. All those features that are negative, you know, lack of speed. I'm not

161
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,960
going to be as fast as I want to be. I'm not going to read as exhaustively as I want to be.

162
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:30,480
I'm not going to remember as much as I want to remember, you know, so often I read again a text,

163
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,720
it's like, oh, I can't believe I read this before. This is so fresh. This is so new. And

164
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,240
there's this other kind of experience that you feel like I was never in a position to really

165
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,920
appreciate this text until now. The passage by Nietzsche, you know, it was just after reading

166
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,360
maybe something by Freud, and he returned to a passage, a paragraph from Beyond Good and Evil,

167
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,880
and you realize, oh my god, what did I read before? I totally missed this. So sorry to

168
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,960
give a long answer to that. No, that's a great question. I really liked the last point because

169
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,520
I think in a conversation you had with Daniel Ghana, you know, OG Rose, they're lovely. I want to

170
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,200
speak to them soon, but I want to first read that book before I have them on. He said a similar

171
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,080
thing where, especially Nietzsche, because it's very aphoristic, so you'd read a bit of Nietzsche,

172
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,520
and then you come back to him, let's say, two, three years later, and it's like a totally different

173
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:38,080
author, you know, a totally different book in some sense. Yeah, I think for me, I see this,

174
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,760
probably it's more for your temperament, because you're a bit of a calmer person,

175
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,520
because I'm a bit of a neurotic person, and I like action, you know, like I'm a typical what

176
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,320
we call this burnout subject in some sense, you know, like I like this kind of making, you know,

177
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,120
Björn Scholland talks about making yourself into a project. You make yourself into like an

178
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:09,200
entrepreneur of the self, right? And therefore, a part of me does like that because I enjoy it,

179
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,320
but also the problem with that is I don't appreciate, as you pointed out, the slowness

180
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,200
and like having the patience and even like that negativity where you detach yourself

181
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,840
from this, let's call it noise or the hyperpositivity, and just sit with an idea. If it's for hours,

182
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,360
if it's just like a verse or an excerpt from a book, hours and even days, and just like kind of

183
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,280
meditating on it. And I found that that can be a lot more valuable than trying to read 60 pages

184
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:48,240
in a day or try to like hit some reading quota or be it may. Yeah, yeah, I'm, you know, the older

185
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,760
I get, the less I can relate to those things like reading quota, like read 200 pages a day.

186
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:04,320
Why? For what purpose? Because the ultimate, the ultimate effect of these reading life is

187
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:11,200
you want the effect to show up when, for example, you are talking to a kid that's like a nine year

188
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,400
old, eight year old kid. That's where, you know, it's a critical moment where you want to behave

189
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:26,160
somewhat wisely when there is a sensitive person who is listening to you or you're dealing with

190
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,960
somebody. And if you're reading 200 pages a day, you're exhausting yourself and you're

191
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,320
very impatient probably when you, when you meet that, you know, kid or student or a person who is

192
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:47,040
really receptive to you, open to you at that moment. I think we should keep an eye out for,

193
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:54,000
for those moments where we want the impact of our reading life to, to show up. You know what I mean?

194
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,040
Because it's, it's all for something, you know, it's, it's supposed to be for something and that

195
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,920
something is, there are very limited chance moments, there are very limited moments of our

196
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:15,600
lives where you want to be like, I try to be a somewhat decent person and reading is, is hopefully

197
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,800
part of that. Interesting. So for you, you always see reading as a, as a, to put it crassly as like a

198
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:30,480
means to an end. Because for me personally, I find that I read for its own sake, like I don't

199
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,880
expect anything out of it. Well, some, some books I do, especially if it's like preparing for like

200
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,280
my studies or the podcast, but some other books, I read them for their own sake. That's a good point.

201
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,640
You want to read for its own sake, but not purely. I mean, there's, there's a limit to that

202
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:58,640
because sometimes it's work. Sometimes it's, it doesn't seem like you're doing it for its own

203
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,840
sake because you're putting the, putting extra effort in. But yeah, that's why I kind of reach out

204
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,520
for some purpose, some other thing out, outside of the intrinsic enjoyment. But yeah, I relate to

205
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,760
reading for its own sake too, as something that is otherwise.

206
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah. Now, I certainly see that because like, especially, you know, this is a beautiful thing

207
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,320
about with all of its discontents, the internet and this kind of new podcasting, whatever you

208
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:35,280
may call it, book, booktube, a community that's being built up. It's like given life of the mind

209
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,640
or reading to use a bit of a pretentious term can be a, you know, very solitary thing. It's just

210
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,080
lovely to see people that are, that truly cherish it, cherish it as much as we do. And we connect

211
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,720
with them through the internet. And that, that for me, despite growing up with the internet,

212
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,160
I've never gotten over the fact that you could just like you're in Canada and I'm here in Australia

213
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:03,360
and we both connect over this shared love for, for reading and learning. I'll never, you know,

214
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,720
get over that fact, that datum, you know? Sure, sure. But you know, there are all these people

215
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:16,640
who cherish reading, but they show the cherishing moments when they turn on the camera, they say

216
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,920
how much they cherish that, the activity of reading, but the camera is off most of the time and they

217
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,280
don't always cherish it. I mean, we don't, I don't, I don't always enjoy reading and I don't, I don't

218
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:34,800
have a very simple, always filled with pleasure relationship with reading. Interesting. To me,

219
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,840
life of the mind is, is full of suffering and uncertainty. It's a struggle to struggle. I

220
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,880
agree. I mean, I joke around, I joke around. I say that I'm probably a bit of like a masochist,

221
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,800
because it's such a struggle to like, I mean, try to read like Hegel, right? I'm like, God,

222
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,880
well, what the hell is this guy talking about? And I, or like, like corn, for instance, and then

223
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,920
it's like, what, but nonetheless, you persevere. And it's never like a walk in the park and like

224
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,240
a very pleasant experience. It's a struggle for sure that I agree. I couldn't agree more with that.

225
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:12,960
Yeah. All right, David. So Bianchel Han, getting back to Bianchel Han. What, what, you know,

226
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,200
especially being a cognitive psychologist, what would you say, what firstly attracted his work,

227
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,560
because he's a critical theorist after all, what attracted you towards his work, but also what

228
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,600
isomorphism similarities do you see between cognitive psychology and the work of Bianchel

229
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:44,640
Han? Oh, I, let's first talk about how I got into his work. So I, and it was by accident.

230
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:53,280
I have a friend who is here in Toronto, and he gave me a copy of The Agony of El Ros.

231
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:03,520
And I noticed the kind of book it is first, I noticed, yeah, it's very short. It's, you know,

232
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,760
50 something pages, I think 53 pages, excluding the notes. And I didn't read it immediately. I just

233
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,680
read a couple of pages and I said, okay, I know, I know what the kind of thing that he's writing

234
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:25,840
about. And three, four years later, I kept running into Han's work in bookstores. And I said, okay,

235
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,480
I'm going to do that thing. I'm going to chronologically read his work beginning with the

236
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:42,320
first burnout society. And so I started. And yeah, that's, that was my entry. I don't want to,

237
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,600
you know, you asked about the relationship or possible relationships between cognitive science

238
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:55,600
and Han. And this is difficult for me to say, given that you, you have this exciting project of

239
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,400
going into cognitive science now. So I don't kind of, I'm hesitant to say this, but for me,

240
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,480
let's say my own particular relationship with cognitive science, I don't have a very

241
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:14,960
high opinion of it. So I would say, for me, becoming increasingly critical of cognitive

242
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,560
psychology, the experimental method as applied to the study of human beings.

243
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:28,000
Han became, eventually, he became one of the resources for me to think about

244
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,960
the conduct of psychologists, my colleagues in academia. So when he talked about, you know,

245
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:45,840
the shrinking of time, we don't have this long view or relationship with time as something

246
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:54,240
that can linger, that continues, that covers a long span, that our form of consciousness

247
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,000
is structured such that time is very brief for us, that we have this

248
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:09,680
more metaphorically, at least ADHD-like kind of subjectivity, where at any given moment,

249
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:15,280
we want to say wow and be surprised and be impressed by a research project in cognitive

250
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:21,120
psychology. I felt like every meeting, every kind of departmental presentation, it started

251
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,560
from scratch, no history, no memory, a quick presentation and a quick wow. And soon after

252
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:34,400
it was done, that's it, it was gone. So you become like, it becomes a piece of entertainment and a

253
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:43,200
piece of, you know, easy, quick persuasion. And if you look back, there's not much relationship

254
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,760
between different projects that people are pursuing. And so when I read and thought with Han, I became

255
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,360
kind of aware of this, this thing that was my career, this is just one expression of

256
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:06,000
something bigger that Han is talking about, namely the neoliberal order, the neoliberal subject of

257
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,280
which, you know, one way it shows up is in research, research projects, projects, you know,

258
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:21,360
in general, projects. Yeah, in fact, I recall in one of the videos, I think the one you made on

259
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:29,040
Psychopolitics, you even mentioned that in academics, like, because again, we're all part of the old

260
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,600
immersed in the neoliberal symbolic order, let's say, right? And academics constantly love coming

261
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,760
up with new terms, new words, new ideas, it's a novelty, you know, we fetishize novelty.

262
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:49,840
And that is because we have this kind of almost imperative to create, to produce.

263
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,320
Yeah, you gotta have a thing, academia, you gotta have your thing. Exactly. Yeah.

264
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,120
That's fascinating. That's fascinating. But first of all, David, I want to say I really do,

265
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,160
that means a lot to me that you took my personal career into into account when

266
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,400
replying to that, because I mean, look, I, it's interesting. I know the, I've spoken to many

267
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,760
people like yourself, who are academics, who've been through this journey. And I know it's,

268
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,720
it's, it certainly has its own problems too, you know, university itself, the neoliberal

269
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:28,560
university has its shortcomings. And in fact, perhaps it's, it's, it's becoming another corporation,

270
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:34,000
unfortunately, like, like, what we see in the rest of society. So I mean, in fact, you're gonna

271
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,840
Yeah, please. But I would never discourage you to, I would never discourage you from pursuing

272
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,560
that way of life, because the problems that we attribute to university life

273
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,080
are not unique to it. Indeed. We become, we become disappointed. Yeah, we become

274
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,160
disappointed and disillusioned to find that university is not special, that it also has

275
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,360
all those problems that we find in the corporate world, for example.

276
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,720
So that's, I mean, there, there are still a lot of good things about having, having a life in

277
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,440
university, you know, teaching and thinking and writing. It's still, there's still a lot of good

278
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:27,600
in it. I should emphasize that for me, after, you know, six years, plus the PhD, getting the PhD,

279
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:34,400
getting the PhD, that was another five years, postdoc one year. So about 11 years after about

280
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,720
11 years, I realized, you know, I had enough of this. I want to do something else. I want to

281
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,960
create something else. And I, it really became a question for me, like, if I don't do this,

282
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,600
what would my life be like? What else could it be? So it was, I needed to

283
00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:01,200
become independent of this thing that I, I continuously criticized, because you can't,

284
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,440
I mean, I, in good conscience, can't continue to criticize something while depending on it,

285
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,480
still, while still getting my salary from it and say, Oh, I hate this. So, so I wanted to live

286
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:22,320
with more integrity. So you know what, I'm going to put my money where my mouth is, or I want to,

287
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:28,640
you know, I want to really, like, really mean this. I mean this critique. I mean it enough to say,

288
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,600
I don't want to devote my life to it anymore. Well, in fact, let's, let's go here. Let's go a bit,

289
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,320
delve a bit deeper into this, because, you know, let's, let's bring in the actual hands, you know,

290
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,320
psychopolitics, excellent book, kind of he, you know, critiques, neoliberalism. So

291
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,760
in the context of academia and the university, David, what would you say in your view is like

292
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,920
the ideal, like the platonic idea, whatever you mean, called the ideal of the university?

293
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:04,240
And then what is the current in actuality of the university we have in, let's say, most of the

294
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:14,240
world, which people like the actual hand are critical of? Wow, that's a very difficult question. I,

295
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,160
you know, we have to, that probably deserves a kind of round table discussion with a lot of people

296
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:31,040
for me and help getting to that ideal, unpacking that really. But just let's say that for me,

297
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:39,360
the idea, the ideal of university is not separable from the type of person that

298
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:52,080
it's supposed to cultivate, a form of life, a form of life that is thoughtful, that is interested,

299
00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:01,200
that is open to a certain kind of wonder, a certain kind of openness,

300
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:10,720
and keeps a certain mindset alive, keeps a certain spirit alive, spirit of inquiry.

301
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:20,400
So it's a form of being that university is the platform, it's the medium for that form of life.

302
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:26,000
So a lot is probably required for that. A lot of practices, a lot of support

303
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,280
goes into that structure. So it's a structure, a place where, you know, a certain form of life can

304
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:44,080
be supported. Right now is what we can say about university, how it deviates, is that people still,

305
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,280
I think people still have that in the back of their mind when they do their works. But

306
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,040
that ideal is something that is perpetually postponed. They will say things like, okay,

307
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:03,680
this year I need to get these publications out. They're not important, I don't really believe in them.

308
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,440
But I need to publish these couple of papers to get the promotion. And after that,

309
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,360
I can focus on what I really want. But this thing, if you pay it, if you keep listening to people,

310
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:28,960
if you keep paying attention, you hear the repetition of this pattern, that it's always later.

311
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,480
And ultimately, it's after they retire that they want to do the thing that they want to do.

312
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,760
They say typically in psychology was, people would say, I want to study consciousness after

313
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,400
I retire. That's a typical thing. Although they get tenure, now that's stability.

314
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,320
Yeah, tenure. But in some cases, even tenure is not enough. Because the department sometimes

315
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,760
turns against you if you do what you like to do after you get tenure, because they say,

316
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,720
we hired you to do this type of research, why did you stop?

317
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:15,200
Yeah, it becomes, I mean, deviation from the ideal, I would say, happens when it becomes

318
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,840
about performance and metrics, and the signs of accomplishment, the signs of success.

319
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,400
Yeah, and then in fact, perhaps you could connect us to that idea that

320
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:33,600
Björn Schullhand talks about his critique of big data. This goes really well again with

321
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,760
your previous point. It's about positivity, right? It's a measure, everything is,

322
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,760
you become another statistic, you put it in like a very cliched way. Whereas as something in thought,

323
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,920
and in fact, he says it's theory, that it's a negativity. There's no, it's not a positive thing,

324
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,240
you kind of remove yourself from being, and it's a different kind of mode of being.

325
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Yeah, remember, when big data was very hot and new, you probably remember this, there were these

326
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:17,760
statements like, now we have so much data, that the need to think isn't, we don't have that need

327
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,640
anymore. We don't have the need, people said that there was a statement about we don't need to think

328
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,360
anymore, and we don't need theory anymore. That definitely, I remember that hearing that, reading

329
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:37,120
that. All those things that we really want to become, to cultivate the capacity for those things,

330
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:44,800
capacity for thought, capacity for theory, these serious consideration of this upper topic or

331
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:52,000
subject matter, that requires lack and requires negativity, and also that having a relationship

332
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,280
with negativity. Big data, the way people think of it as like, providing us too much, more than we

333
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:08,320
need, we get so much that you almost become like, helpless, like you can't, it's not up to you anymore

334
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:16,880
after crossing some threshold. It's not up to us, we just submit to it, we submit to the big data.

335
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:25,440
Yeah, I mean, perhaps, I'd say for me, the almost quintessential example of this is health and fitness,

336
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,280
you probably noticed that people have the watch where they track their steps,

337
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,480
they track their sleep, they got the ring to, I think, track their pulse heartbeat. I mean,

338
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:42,960
you know, you completely mechanize the human body to a point where I think in my view,

339
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:50,080
it ends up, it ends up harming you because you know, you burn out from that kind of like, you get

340
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:57,680
fatigued from this constantly having to, you know, measure yourself. In fact, a funny anecdote,

341
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,480
one of my friends, I'm not going to mention her name obviously, she even has like a,

342
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:09,280
almost like a Trello boat or like a project management, like a software she uses to keep

343
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:16,640
track of her dating, her dates. So like, this person has these pros, these cons, and she's a

344
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,880
lovely person, we get along really well, but, and we're quite close. So I always kind of make

345
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,200
fun of her for this, you know, do you, do you keep track of like, how many times you had sex per

346
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,120
week and everything? And I'm like, I even tell her personally, for me, if I live like that,

347
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,120
I'd probably end up killing myself. I mean, I can't think of anything more depressing than

348
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,960
having to track everything in that sense and making yourself a part of this big data ideology,

349
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,840
let's say. Yeah, that's, that's very interesting. I haven't heard of anybody doing that, but

350
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,200
we should still ask like, what is that tracking doing? It might not be doing what it might,

351
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,760
what it would do for us. Maybe for some people, it just creates that, the sense of stability and

352
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,160
that, you know, it might not result in anything, it might not lead anywhere, these dates that I'm

353
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,480
going, but at least I have this, the records of it. Yeah, for some people, that could be, you know,

354
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:24,240
they could write a novel about that. Maybe that's similar to like a technological record keeping.

355
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,000
Yeah, I think a lot of it has to do with this. This, this, I mean, in fact, let me read out this

356
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,320
quote, David, I was gonna, this idea where there's this lovely thing where it says, so the achievement

357
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,640
subject, this is from the Bernard Society, Björn Chaland says, the achievement subject explodes

358
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:53,920
itself until it burns out. In the process, it develops auto aggression that often enough,

359
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,760
escalates into the violence of self destruction. The project turns out to be a projectile that

360
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,600
the achievement subject is aiming at itself. And I think for me, this goes back to the idea that

361
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,320
everything has to be a project, right, including academia. And then, and then the problem is,

362
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,560
and just to kind of get at this bit, but like high level, in the book, he talks about how in

363
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,840
disciplinary society, kind of what Foucault critiques, the, it's, it's still a society of

364
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:31,040
prohibition, right, you do, thou shall not, you shall not have sex before marriage, you shall not,

365
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,680
if you're, you know, gay marriage is illegal, whatever you may call it. Whereas in our society,

366
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,200
in the society of the hyper positivity, we achievement subjects, everything is, yes,

367
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:48,080
you can, yes, you should. And in that sense, I think we, we, we all of us, all of us, this is,

368
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:53,680
in no way am I like sitting on like high chair, like pointing fingers, we all do this. I know I

369
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:00,000
do this. We make projects out of our life and we ourselves become a project. So, and I think

370
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,160
Han puts it beautifully, we exploit ourselves. And to get back to this thing about what you said

371
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,600
about stability, I think there is, there is this idea at least in my view that this is feeling,

372
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,000
you do get some kind of safety when you feel like everything is tracked, everything is in order,

373
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,120
you know, everything, everything has a place, everything makes sense. Now, we don't know in

374
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:31,360
reality if that stability exists, but at least the, the ideology is, yes, my, my romantic life,

375
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,880
I can plan it out. I know, I'll know exactly who I'll meet, the kind of person I want, or the tick

376
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:44,560
all the boxes. And of course, in, at least in my view, what happens there is we are always,

377
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,320
we're always surprised. In fact, I'd argue the paradoxes, the more you try to order your life,

378
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:58,720
the more control you lose. Right, right. It just also occurred to me that that, that's the closer

379
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,560
to the transparency society to, to keep records of everything. You're making your dating life

380
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,760
transparent to yourself, to yourself and potentially to other spectators, that this is what I'm

381
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,800
doing and I'm recording everything here. And the other thing that happens with that is everything

382
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,920
becomes the same because person number one and person number seven, because you kept track of them

383
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,720
with respect to similar dimensions, they are comparable, they all become comparable. And the

384
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:39,680
otherness about them, their alterity is pushed aside. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Could you elaborate on

385
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,840
that point? I'm so glad you brought that up. The idea of otherness and alterity, how that,

386
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,720
how that's a part of our subjectivity in some sense. Yeah, so I think that's, I mean, by,

387
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,440
by definition, that's a difficult concept to articulate because it's always what we call

388
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:10,880
the other, truly other is always the thing that is not captured by the logic of our current project.

389
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,120
Whatever that is not that you're not capable of because of the way we have positioned ourselves,

390
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:25,360
the kind of structure that you're participating in. By virtue of that, the other is outside of

391
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:35,760
that, and we are not ready to even understand it. What we can do is to be, we could say vulnerable

392
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:44,480
to it, we could become vulnerable to its effects, like having an argument with, with, you know,

393
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,600
with our significant other, having something that a disagreement that seems irreconcilable,

394
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,200
or having a problem with a stranger and not even knowing what the root of the problem is.

395
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:09,200
So Han, identity, he argues that we are inclined to move in the direction of sameness,

396
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:17,520
the tyranny or the terror of sameness to impose structures and logic, kinds of logic,

397
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:25,840
when we deal with different kinds of situations, impose kinds of logic that simplifies what we

398
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:33,360
are encountering and treats plurality in terms of same, so same kinds of stuff. So in dating,

399
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:40,400
for example, the example, very useful, we just number people or the books, you know,

400
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,040
hundred classics that you should read before you die, you know, that's like, that's also a kind

401
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:52,080
of unfair way of treating books because, you know, you want to hundreds and one is probably the best,

402
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:58,400
hundred is like, yeah, okay, you can skip that. But the logic of sameness is imposed on that,

403
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,520
on that list, you know, it turned the thing turns into a list. So it's, it's very interesting by,

404
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,680
by getting out of that, funny enough, the effect of that is the kind of liberation,

405
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,160
you liberate ourselves by getting out of the logic of sameness. Indeed. And the detail of that,

406
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:26,320
the detail of that is in a book that I haven't yet finished by Han is the expulsion of the other.

407
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:36,320
But just like any, any of his books, it's great by really continuing and, and

408
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:43,840
and illuminating what he has done in the previous books. So, for example, you just touched on the

409
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:50,800
burnout society. And he, he says this, he makes this really beautiful, very insightful observation

410
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,600
that, you know, he's talking about the new liberal regime and self exploitation. Okay.

411
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,040
But we perceive that self exploitation as freedom and we are, we think that we are self

412
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:11,760
optimizing, self realizing. And he writes here, there is no other as exploiter to the,

413
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,760
the exploiter is not another forcing me to work and alienating me from myself. Rather,

414
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,680
I voluntarily exploit myself in the belief that I am realizing myself. This is the diabolical

415
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,560
logic of neoliberalism. And then he writes, hence the first stage of a burnout is euphoria.

416
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,280
The first stage of burnout is euphoria. You're happy in the beginning.

417
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:42,800
I plunge into work euphorically until I finally collapse. This is, this is really,

418
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:50,640
it's a transferable insight. You might think about this type, there's a type of person who

419
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:57,680
gets in and out of relationships, and they get really passionate. When they start a relationship,

420
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:05,120
they get this euphoria of, I finally find, found the one. And of course, these problems,

421
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:10,960
they're waiting. The problems are brewing from the very beginning. It's not that something goes

422
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,640
wrong. No, the very structure from the very beginning is set up for that huge, heated

423
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:24,640
disappointment to happen and for the explosion, for a breakup to happen explosively. So this

424
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:32,640
is now in here, in this passage, Han is describing burnout as something that

425
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:40,240
we set ourselves up for from the very beginning, when we euphorically start engaging with the project.

426
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:48,160
Indeed, like the absolute high and then the complete destruction, isn't it, that comes along

427
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,640
with it? Yeah. Yes, they're part of the same, they're part of the same pattern.

428
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,880
Yeah, because we set it up through this kind of, let's call it within our society, kind of what

429
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:05,680
the ideology we hold, hold dear to us. And two points on that, David, one other really good

430
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:12,000
example you used to this kind of the massification of like sameness is traveling. I remember you,

431
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,920
I think you used it in one of your videos. And look, I'm not again anti-traveling, I'll be going

432
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,640
on a holiday next month, in fact, but I am very, very critical and I even find it, I'm a bit even,

433
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,720
I even detest this idea that, you know, I got to tick all the boxes every single city of Paris

434
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,560
or Florence or Berlin or and go to Europe, especially, you know, because us Australians here,

435
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:41,920
we're quite away from Europe. So love going to Europe. And then the point you make is that it's

436
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,880
kind of cheap and you go to Paris, you stay there for four days and you're like, I know Paris,

437
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,040
you know, but of course, that's not how you get to know a city. And then that same ideology,

438
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:59,360
it comes along to other human beings too, you know, you start viewing even humans,

439
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,440
it's just another person, just another city, just another commodity.

440
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:10,400
Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of, it's almost tragic that we get very close to getting somewhere,

441
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,560
you know, when you travel, when you go to Paris, you just get so, it's such an opportunity.

442
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:22,160
It's an amazing city, amazing history. You go there and then people miss it.

443
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,920
People miss the fact that it's supposed to be enjoyed, it's supposed to be an experience,

444
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,000
you're supposed to be surprised. And maybe you go through the Paris syndrome, that's another

445
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:39,600
whole thing. But to what I noticed, unfortunately, the tragedy is that for, for people, for some

446
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:47,440
people, it becomes about taking photos and then it doesn't become enjoyable until the moment they

447
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,600
are back and they show those pictures to their friends. That's when they start enjoying it.

448
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:59,920
I mean, that's just, I mean, that's kind of, that's a kind of sickness, isn't it?

449
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,680
It is a kind of sickness, but also I think it's, you know, in the Transparency Society,

450
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:09,760
he has a one essay called the Society of Exhibition, where you've got to exhibit your,

451
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,120
it's like, until you got the approval from the other, in this case, the gaze of the social

452
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,640
media, it's as if you haven't really done this thing. You know, and I think

453
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:28,960
he says, the Society of Exhibition is a society of pornography, that kind of hyper unconcealment.

454
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:35,680
I really do like that because it's like, it's as if we want to get rid of this friction

455
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:42,480
between us and the world. We want it to be completely seamless and there's no, it's just

456
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,960
whatever it's in here, it has to be out there. Whereas for me, the subject, what's really

457
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,680
fascinating, and I think Jijek gets this point quite well, is that we are a complete fisher in

458
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,000
being, we're, it's this absolute negativity that that kind of, we kind of, in many ways, we don't

459
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:02,640
fit into the subject, doesn't fit into the order of things because of this absolute negativity

460
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:09,440
that that's created. And with this need to be completely transparent, we completely

461
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:19,120
jettison this negativity. Right. And that's where for me, traveling, because, you know,

462
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,920
if you think about it, I am all about, in some sense, I'm like a levinazi and like, I really

463
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,840
believe in exposing yourself and opening yourself to the other. And travel, you could argue, is a

464
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,920
beautiful way to do that, you know, opening yourself to just a completely different culture,

465
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:42,480
a different mode of being even. But if it becomes kind of like the whole, it's just going to become a

466
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,600
game for, you know, Instagram selfies. So it was put up on the internet. There's no, there's absolutely

467
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:53,200
no opening yourself to the other. It's just simply another exhibition. It's another, yeah,

468
00:51:53,200 --> 00:52:00,320
another box to take. Yeah, yeah. All the inconveniences of traveling and people,

469
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,800
the parts that we are inclined to not appreciate, I mean, those are the real, those are when those

470
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:18,080
are the moments where we encounter what is not planned, what is the real justification for

471
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:24,400
getting out, getting, getting into the, indeed, into the journey. Just, it's a really good point

472
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,880
you make about the inconvenience, because I know you've been on Kareel Last, the philosophy

473
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:35,760
portal, his podcast, love his work. I mean, I feel like the, I'm hoping to talk to him one day.

474
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,080
I'm probably going to have like one of those moments, because he was one of the first people

475
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:46,160
that I, his channel was the resource for me to understand, you know, probably five years ago.

476
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:52,160
I went through his lectures and then Hegel and he's an amazing, amazing elucidator. But anyway,

477
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,800
leaving that aside, he has this point about inconvenience. He says that, you know, we,

478
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,280
we have these kinds of conversations online and it's fantastic. Like it's just,

479
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,360
it's like an oasis of where we could just get lost in this world of thinking and theory and

480
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:13,280
philosophy. But he does say there is something very convenient about this, right? As in, let's

481
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,200
say David, you and I, we wanted to have the same conversation in person. You're in Canada, I'm in

482
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:25,200
Australia. We may have to organize our flights, take up a lot of time from our day and there's

483
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:32,160
like a lot of friction for us to have this in person. But now all I had to do was just, I mean,

484
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,880
I sent you an email and a bit of back and forth, but that's nothing compared to, and then, you know,

485
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,000
click a button, zoom video opens up. All of that friction is taken away. And I wonder

486
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:49,280
if there will be some kind of richness that comes out of this friction, if it is in person

487
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,720
and how it's in the future of like this kind of what we're doing in this community, how that

488
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,760
would be where I'm, I'm trying to see as I grow this community, if I can do a bit, a few more

489
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:07,440
in person events in Australia, just so that there's something, the difficulty of that itself

490
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,400
makes it worth it, if I could put it that way. Yeah, that's a great idea to do more in person

491
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:20,640
stuff. Just, you know, if you and I just to use this to stay with this example, if you and I were

492
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:26,960
planning to meet, it could not just be because it's such a big distance between us. It can just be

493
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,600
like, okay, we talked for an hour and then bye, see you later. It has to be like, okay, if you're

494
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:36,000
visiting, you know, I have to kind of help accommodate you and help find accommodation for

495
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,520
you or vice versa. It becomes more than what we were initially interested in. We have to embrace

496
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:49,200
more. We have to kind of accept that there's going to be more inconvenience for this, you know,

497
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:56,000
a small slice of interaction that I was planning. I'm supposed to, I'm forced to have like a whole

498
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,880
bunch of unplanned, you know, but necessary, it's going to be a lot of necessary evil in that process.

499
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:12,880
But technology is really, it's good at eliminating all those and giving us just that one slice,

500
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,360
precisely the slice that you asked for, you're going to get it and then turn it off, turn off the

501
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:28,080
zoom and you're done. But there's a, we can be skeptical of that purity.

502
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,120
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I've always been skeptical of this idea of like,

503
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:39,920
pristine purity, refined things. I, I, I, here's a game where I'm sorry, I keep referring to

504
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,000
Jack. He is one of my master signifiers. I refer to him a lot because I've essentially,

505
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
my ontology is just ontology. And like, he always talks about that yet. There's something it's in

506
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:58,240
the, it's in the, the flaws, it's in the, the lopsidedness, it's in the, the antagonisms,

507
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,360
whatever you may call it, it's, it's in the error itself in some sense, the answer lies.

508
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:11,120
And, and I liked the idea that complete order is felt, that's fascism, but also

509
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,240
complete disorder, that's anarchism, right? So I'm not trying to say you need to get

510
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,720
find the best of both, but I think that the trick is to find disorder in the order.

511
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,280
And to see that, okay, yeah, yeah, things can be seamless, but there's some, there's value to

512
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:36,240
things going wrong too. An example is that way, you know, when the Frenchy jokes around,

513
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:42,240
when the cheese went off, the French took that, that error, the fault, and now we have blue cheese

514
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:48,400
over the wine, it went off, no, we have champagne. So it's to find something positive in the

515
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:55,360
error, something productive in the error itself. Yeah, yeah, philosophy itself could be an error

516
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:01,680
in normal conversation, in normal discourse. You know, there was this guy, Socrates, for example,

517
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:08,000
he kind of introduced weird variations in questioning people and questions and answers.

518
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,880
But to make that official, to officially bring that into conversation,

519
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,280
that would be the active philosophy, the decision.

520
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,920
And speaking of, David, I would like to revisit the agony of eros, because this is certainly,

521
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,640
I think, but I think it's the same for you, burnout and agony of eros are my favorite.

522
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,000
I've only read probably four or five of his books. So I certainly love this book.

523
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,520
One point I want to make about the agony of eros is, and I don't know what your thoughts on this

524
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:49,040
are. So we talk a lot about this, like the other and how the other can be a complete alien other,

525
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:58,240
and then they kind of disturb our sameness, our controlled life. But I really liked the kind

526
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,680
of the notion that Alain Bajor makes that, yes, it's true that the other is completely alien,

527
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:11,440
you can never plan the love event in that sense. But when he says love takes two,

528
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,360
and in the event of love, by allowing yourself to like opening yourself up to the other,

529
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,520
there is a higher truth or a newer truth created. So love becomes a project in that sense. So it's

530
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:29,440
not that the other is a complete alien and then your life is complete chaos. But through this,

531
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,800
again, it's paradoxically through opening yourself up to this other, you've, in some

532
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:41,520
sense, you find a truth even about yourself. And I'm wondering, I don't know if that makes

533
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,000
sense. I'm sorry for being a bit long winded. No, no, no, no. Just like if you want to comment

534
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,360
on that, because for me, that's a beautiful idea of like letting ourself love and opening

535
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:58,720
us up to the other. Yeah, I think maybe something that you also are, you're also expressing in that

536
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:10,720
with that sentiment is the idea that the other is not just outside, that it's an inner other too,

537
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:20,240
that you discover about yourself. That this logic of sameness, this imposition that we do,

538
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:27,440
we also impose it on ourselves. Like the idea of waking up and planning every minute,

539
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,040
since the moment you wake up until the moment optimizing everything, optimization is really

540
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,800
based based on the assumption that I know myself. I know what I can do. And I know what I want to do.

541
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:46,160
But it's, it's a very dull life if I operate with the assumption that I know everything

542
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:53,840
that about myself, I know what I'm what I should do. So yeah, I agree that it's, you know, our

543
00:59:53,840 --> 01:00:01,200
relationships that we find aspects of ourselves that we wouldn't, we wouldn't find.

544
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:09,520
Long time ago, I had a friend who is a very close friend, and in a moment in a sentimental moment,

545
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:15,440
she told me, if I don't talk with you for too long, I will forget who I am.

546
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:23,440
And it really made me think, I feel, I feel like that's a general statement that we could apply

547
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:30,560
to all good friendships. And if we don't get in touch with our good friends, we will really lose

548
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:36,320
touch with ourselves. Because they provide us with a place, a good friendship, a good conversation,

549
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:46,800
provides us with a place to be, to dwell, to express who we are, and then be responded to.

550
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:54,240
And in that dialogue, we, we find something. And that part of that something is, is ourselves.

551
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:02,480
But it's not the narcissistic self. It's the, is the other self, if you will.

552
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,360
And how have you found, because I was going to read out, it's a bit of a mouthful. So let me

553
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,520
in fact, because the book ends the agony of heroes. And I'm so glad you brought up your friend,

554
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:19,200
because the, the part I'm going to read is about friendship. So beyond Shalan ends the,

555
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:26,880
the book saying, the philosopher is a friend, a lover. Here, the lover is not an outward personality

556
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:34,720
and empirical circumstance, but a presence that is intrinsic to thought, the condition of possibility

557
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:42,800
of thought itself, a living category, a transcendental lived reality. And this is perhaps my favorite

558
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:48,960
part, because this idea of thinking, thinking in the strong sense begins with heroes.

559
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:58,320
To be able to think, one must first have been a friend, a lover. Without heroes, thinking loses

560
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:09,280
all vitality and turmoil and becomes repetitive and reactive. Heroes infuses thinking with desire

561
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:16,800
for the atopic other. So, you know, and this your friend said that she, she kind of

562
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,680
forgets even who she is, unless she's in dialogue with you. And I'd say I have a lot of friends in

563
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:27,760
my life where I do know if I don't talk to them, eventually I start forgetting even who I am.

564
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:36,160
I love that line. Thank you for reading that. To be able to think one must first have been a

565
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:46,320
friend, a lover. It's so true. And it, you know, because people who have an interest in philosophy

566
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:53,440
and have been involved with philosophy for years, they might forget that, that it didn't begin with

567
01:02:53,440 --> 01:03:02,080
an interest in a given book or a philosophical question. It began as maybe in a context of a

568
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,560
relationship with a teacher or with a friend, with a person who seemed very intriguing.

569
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:15,760
There was friendliness there at the bottom. And that's why a lot of times, philosophical

570
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:22,400
questions begin with a line of thought with something like, what is love? What is true love?

571
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:29,600
Or, you know, in some movies, characters ask each other, can men and women really be just friends?

572
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,880
You have a relationship with someone and within the context of a relationship, friendship,

573
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:42,240
those questions are posed. But the engine of those questions is their relationship,

574
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:48,080
that's the idea. But it's so easy to forget that. And that itself is also interesting

575
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:52,720
that we forget. Yeah, yeah. No, I think that's beautiful.

576
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:00,880
Well, I feel like we did touch on the burnout society, but I perhaps maybe let's try that,

577
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:06,480
because for me, what I was thinking was, so for myself, I've been recommending

578
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,840
Byung-Shul Han to many people and even sharing your videos around, in fact.

579
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,680
And one reason I do that is because I think people that aren't, and I don't mean this in

580
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:20,800
any way in like a super serious, you know, condescending way, people that aren't, let's say,

581
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,960
obsessed with reading the way you and I are. You know, this is why I started the question

582
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:32,720
with how do you read philosophy? Because, you know, philosophers write in dense ways that are,

583
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:38,960
you know, esoteric and abstruse, it's really hard to get through to them. And for me, Byung-Shul

584
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:45,200
Han is certainly an exception, because I find his work extremely accessible, like he writes in very

585
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:54,080
clear, concise terms, plain language. And that's, that's one reason, you know, I talk about him.

586
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:59,520
So, but then the other reason is because he theorizes, he's a, he's a living, breathing,

587
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,160
critical theorist, right? It's not, we're not reading Heidegger from the 20th century or,

588
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:09,760
or Adorno from the 20th century, we're reading a person that's, that's in, for instance, in

589
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,240
Transparency Society. He talks about Facebook, you know, he talks about social media. So,

590
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:21,040
I'm curious to ask a rather, there's a bit of a banal question, but I think it's worth discussing

591
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:26,320
what are your views on the world of social media? This, I mean, I'm going to stop calling it the

592
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:30,560
online world, because I don't think it's the online world anymore. It is our world. It's our

593
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:37,440
life world. Social media has become, it's become the modern church that become the, the town square

594
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:43,440
in some sense. So, just through the kind of the Beyoncé hard framework, let's say, or worldview,

595
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:51,200
what are your views on the world of social media? Yeah, great. The world of social media, these,

596
01:05:51,200 --> 01:06:00,880
these media platforms, there are places for consumption, but they're also, at the same time,

597
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:09,520
places for production. You and I, we both go there to produce, and they are not neutral. They,

598
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:15,680
they put demands on us. They put demands on us both when we are consuming and they put demands

599
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:22,640
on us both, you know, also when we are, you know, putting a producer hat or content creator

600
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:30,880
uncomfortable with that phrase. But, you know, we all, as somebody who posts, anybody who posts

601
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:38,560
regularly on, on YouTube, you know that the super ego of the YouTuber tells, tells him or her

602
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:45,840
or them that you should put, put something every week. You should post something. You should have

603
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:51,600
a posting schedule. Why? Because the platform demands you, demands that from you. Algorithmic

604
01:06:51,680 --> 01:07:02,480
DIA. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So social media, to me, every time I, I feel like

605
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:10,480
I'm really using social media for myself or for genuine human relationships, it always feels like

606
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:17,280
I'm cheating it or I'm getting away using it in the way that I'm not supposed to use. I have a

607
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:24,560
couple of friends that I, I messaged back and forth on Twitter, and Twitter with them is

608
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:29,520
like a messaging system. It's private messaging. You know, we have these long threads of

609
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:37,440
talking about books that we're reading. And Twitter or X is not supposed to be used that way.

610
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:45,600
It has its own way of, that it wants you to use it. Ideally, you will use it in this way.

611
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:54,640
So yeah, I think it's important to be, you're right. Han is important to read because he's writing

612
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:02,160
for our time. He's writing for us. He really is writing about things that are aspects of our

613
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:10,960
reality. And that includes the digital media, social media, or, you know, quote on quote social

614
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:18,240
media because they're not really social. I don't always feel like I'm connected when I, when I'm

615
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:23,840
there. So I decided I myself, I don't know what your thoughts are on this, but I decided to limit,

616
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:29,360
really limit. So I don't have Facebook anymore. I don't have Instagram anymore. I just felt like

617
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,800
I need one or two. So I kept YouTube and, and X formerly known as Twitter. These two, I feel

618
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:45,600
like, okay, two, I can, I can deal with them. I can be careful with them. But when it comes to like

619
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:51,920
multiple, you're always catching up. I felt like I was always catching up to them. And you have

620
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:58,480
different people in your social circle. Everybody is more on one platform. It's really, it's really

621
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:03,760
strange. And you forget that, you know, these people are not really in your life, some of them.

622
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:08,080
Some of them are not really in your life. You like delete Facebook, completely lose touch with

623
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:13,840
some of them. And I did. It was like, okay, what does that mean? I don't know.

624
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,080
Yeah, I like that you said social media is not social. I couldn't agree more. In fact,

625
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:27,600
it's a, for me, it should probably be called something like a narcissistic media or something

626
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,760
because it's, I've realized that this goes back to the idea of you, you discussing sameness

627
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:38,160
in social media. It's the ultimate tool to make everything same. Because everyone's just

628
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:46,080
another follower, another comment, another listener. And then, which is why, in fact, I should have

629
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:50,560
spoken about this earlier. I love that you do the reading groups, where it's a much more smaller,

630
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:56,560
closer community. And you know, the people that it's not a parasocial relationship.

631
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:02,320
That being said, David, I want to ask you this. I love asking this question from kind of people

632
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:09,520
who are into critical theory. So you probably noticed or observed a lot of technologists,

633
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:15,120
they, they think, okay, the solution is decentralization, crypto social media,

634
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:21,360
sorry, blockchain social media, or the solution is this new telegram or like, so

635
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:29,040
that they always look for technological solutions, right, as in to the, to our perils of our contemporary

636
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:35,600
world. Now, personally, I don't think the solution is technological, even though it's

637
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,560
interesting, you said that you cut off certain platforms, you cut off Instagram and Facebook,

638
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:47,600
and you only use Twitter and or X and YouTube, perhaps in that case, yeah, so those, those

639
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:53,840
platforms suit more of what you want to do on social media. But at a broader level, I'm wondering,

640
01:10:53,840 --> 01:11:00,960
do you think not that there are simple solutions to any of this, but at least to, let's say,

641
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,440
reduce human suffering? I mean, I think that's a good thing that people, people have through

642
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,760
social media. Do you think that the solution is technological? Do you think it's,

643
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:15,920
it's something a lot more social and ideological or political even? Or has there got to be

644
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:21,360
something which is kind of a dialectical between between the both, between both these, let's say,

645
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:32,080
camps? I'm not sure. I think if you think of technology broadly,

646
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:40,800
beyond just digital technology, I think the answer has to be technological. And that just means

647
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:49,200
being mindful of how we use our infrastructure, the platforms that we have. And, you know,

648
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:53,760
I'm using technology in the sense that, you know, a chalkboard is a piece of technology, too.

649
01:11:54,720 --> 01:12:00,880
You know, a matchbox is a, or a glass is, you know, a piece of technology. It, we,

650
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:10,000
any kind of solution requires its own technology and it's, it comes with its own set of beliefs

651
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,960
as well. So it's, I think they go hand in hand. The kind of world that is reflected in the

652
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:24,720
technologies that we embrace. But yeah, I'm not sure. I don't really spend much time thinking about

653
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:35,200
large-scale solutions. I don't think my brain really has those, those ambitions, unfortunately.

654
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:42,720
The reason I asked was because I think my, in fact, I still haven't got like a thesis topic,

655
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:49,040
but something I would like to theorize on is for my masters is like on the philosophy of technology

656
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:57,440
and kind of see if I can do that. And, you know, a person who perhaps the single handle of the

657
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:03,520
essay that influenced me the most is Heidegger's A Question Concerning Technology. And like the

658
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:08,880
idea is that, you know, this is now kind of like a point that I think everyone agrees on that

659
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:15,920
technology isn't itself a neutral thing. It has its own metaphysic. It's always

660
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:22,960
tilted towards a certain side. It cannot be neutral or objective. So when we introduce a

661
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:28,720
technology that itself comes with its baggage of let's say ideas and presupposition. So,

662
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:37,840
and like, but then the question is, does that mean, does that mean the, the, that technology,

663
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,200
you know, the kind of the more than the Marxist sense that our material conditions,

664
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:48,400
the technology will change how people, people's beliefs, or is it more that the technology is

665
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:53,440
created out of more of like the background beliefs people already have. So to use again,

666
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:59,280
Bjarne Schultz's idea that the idea of burnout society, where everything becomes a project,

667
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:04,000
you'd see people create like myriad software tools to make him a productive

668
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:11,600
and tracking tools, you know, different kinds of, so for me, those, those technologies are kind

669
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:17,840
of like symptoms of what our society has at the moment, like our current, yeah, in some sense,

670
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:23,520
I'd call it a sickness, you know. And so I don't know, I'm just bringing some ideas out here just

671
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,720
to, you know, hear your thoughts, but I found them quite interesting. Example I sometimes think

672
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:38,320
about is, you know, when I, for the first time I joined Twitter, I really became aware of how

673
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:46,000
my mind slowly started to think in terms of tweets. You know, this was years ago, this was,

674
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:55,840
I think, 2014. That was before I first deleted my Twitter account and joined again after some years.

675
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:02,160
But this, this change happens, this change of, you know, you're plugged into a, to a piece of

676
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:13,200
technology and it morphs, it shapes the ways in which not necessarily the content, but it forms

677
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:18,960
your thoughts, say, okay, your thoughts appear to you, appear in your mind in the form of a, of a

678
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:24,400
tweet, or you get an idea and the idea is already pre-packaged. If you're a YouTuber,

679
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:31,520
your idea is already, it comes to you in the form of a, of a YouTube idea, idea for a YouTube video

680
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:37,440
and you write it down. I'm sure that's how novelists or short story writers experience their

681
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:42,960
lives. They experience a moment where an idea comes to them and they write it down potentially,

682
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:49,120
because they are, they're, they're plugged into that practice of writing short stories or writing

683
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:55,120
novels. We are plugged into these technologies that we have relationships with and they enable

684
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:02,240
certain forms of, forms of expressions and prohibits other forms of expressions that, you know,

685
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:11,760
they're, they're out now. And if you take it, if you take a radical view, the kinds of expressions

686
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,920
that we come capable, we, we are capable of because of these technologies are the kind of,

687
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:21,760
kinds of expressions that we are capable of thinking. The things that we cannot say anymore

688
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:29,200
are the things that we cannot think anymore. So the, the very structure, the very form of our,

689
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:35,920
our beliefs are limited and formed. In addition to that, there's this time bound

690
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,880
and nature of the things that we say, you know, something comes to my mind. I

691
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:46,720
write a tweet about it and I let go of it. It's gone. I, my relationship to it becomes like,

692
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:53,120
oh, look at me. I did that. How many likes did I receive? Okay, 20 or 10 or two, you know,

693
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:01,120
but it becomes like, it brings it into a particular logic of sameness that all thoughts are equal.

694
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,640
You know, the difference between them is based on this metric of likes or views or whatever

695
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:15,840
the metric is that the platform tells us. You talked about that. You said these technologies

696
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:22,720
might shape our beliefs. But I think before that, that's, that's certainly true that they influence

697
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:29,280
what we believe, but they also influence how we believe. They influence how we relate to the things,

698
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:34,880
how strictly, how seriously we take them, or what else do we take seriously? Like,

699
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,400
is that what you meant by the form of belief?

700
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:46,800
Yeah. Yeah, the form. I see. The how, the how of our, you know, thoughts. Indeed. Indeed. In fact,

701
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,400
uh, you know, Simon Critchley, when I spoke to him, he made a really good point that, yes,

702
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:57,280
the internet social media has done, it's done wonders for philosophy because now everyone's,

703
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,200
you know, having these kinds of conversations, people are listening to philosophers online. It's

704
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:06,960
like everyone's exposed to philosophy in some sense. It's just, it's so convenient. But

705
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:13,280
it's been terrible for the novel. It's been terrible for long form. You, you kind of,

706
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:19,280
you sit in some corner, no distractions, and you just read a book. You read, I don't know,

707
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:24,640
James Joyce. So I'm not that I've read James Joyce, but you know, where you can, you can really

708
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,360
spend days and even months, you know, carefully gone through a book. And

709
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:34,800
because of this idea that as you, you said it, well, that all, everything's the same. All ideas

710
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:43,840
are the same. So no, no, no pinker, no novel, no work of art deserves some kind of salience over

711
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:50,080
every other book out there, you know, and, and, and I find that quite interesting. So, and,

712
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:55,760
and yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, because for me, I always thought that

713
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,200
it's, it's, it's a rather like simple thing to say that, oh, of course, technology affects us

714
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:05,920
and our thoughts. That's, that's fine. But my, something I really would like to explore more is

715
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:12,320
what, what creates technology? I mean, okay, a part of it is certainly this kind of creative

716
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:18,880
impulse that we all humans have this, this need to create. But the, the, the different kinds of

717
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:25,520
technologies we do create in our society. What's the, what are the, what's, what are the ideological

718
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:31,520
presuppositions we create them off? You know, be the productivity app and my background's in computer

719
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,840
science. I'm a software engineer. So I think a lot about software, you know, be the productivity

720
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:40,880
app or some kind of like sales app. So what are the presuppositions we have when we have the

721
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:44,000
motivations to create a technology? And that's the part that interests me.

722
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:52,320
And is that motivation, is, is that motivation something that we get from the market?

723
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:58,000
Yeah. I mean, that's, that's a good question. Cause like, okay, a very, I think I'm playing

724
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,760
with it, put it as, yes, for money. I want to, you know, I want to make, I want to have like a

725
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,720
startup and make a lot of money. But I don't know. I don't think it's that simple. I think

726
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:11,040
that's a bit of a, because there are many ways to make money. I mean, you could, I don't know, you

727
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:17,280
could become a real estate agent and make a lot of money. But I find that these, especially in

728
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:21,680
the tech world, the more of like the hipster creative types, they have this, you know, they

729
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:25,840
have this very like, even like a messiah complex, I want to save the world. I want to create this

730
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:32,000
amazing software that, that revolutionizes lives. And so my question is where do those beliefs come

731
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,320
from? Right. But the very, the very statement that this is going to make money, that itself,

732
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:47,360
tacitly, it is expressing a set of beliefs about the market that a certain type of app will sell

733
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,440
because, that's true, because there's a demand for it, because there's a market for it, because

734
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:56,000
certain types of things are in demand, because we live in a culture where productivity is,

735
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:01,280
is in value and people are struggling with it. So a productivity app is going to be great.

736
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,240
And so those, those kinds of,

737
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:08,800
now I stood one, I said, like, if you want to make money, you want to create something that,

738
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,880
that falls within the logic of the market. And then that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

739
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:21,440
Excellent. And said, I mean, oh, wow, it's funny, I lost record time. It's almost,

740
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:26,880
we, we got about 10, 15 minutes remaining. I was going to say, I wasn't very efficient.

741
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,680
Oh, no, please. Oh my God, don't worry. This has been an absolutely enjoyable path. And

742
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
this has been an absolute pleasure for the police. I mean, look, I really hope we can have a lot more

743
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,800
conversations and like keep on, keep this dialogue going. But it's funny, I was going to say,

744
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:48,720
in the interest of time, and then I realized that the utter hypocrisy of that, that we're talking

745
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:56,160
about slowness and taking time, but, but just for the listeners, because really, you know,

746
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:02,880
my, one of my goals with this conversation, again, see, I'm goal oriented was to kind of

747
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,760
propagandize for Bianchel Han. It really was that I really wanted more people to read him because

748
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:14,160
I think, I think that's great value in, in, in reading his work. Just, just, yeah, just for

749
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:20,880
the listeners to kind of put in like a very simplistic way, let's say, or like in a nutshell,

750
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:28,880
to use the term I hate. What do you think of Bianchel Han's perhaps his most valuable insights

751
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:34,720
and his most pertinent insights to our time and that perhaps can be a reason to read him?

752
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:44,640
I would say I would emphasize for people who are new to Han, I would, you know, my kind of

753
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:54,880
invitation would be, he is really great at connecting our very personal experiences,

754
01:22:54,880 --> 01:23:03,920
like the experience of being tired, the experience of not having enough mental energy to do all the

755
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:10,560
tasks that you're supposed to do, the experiences of loneliness, being tired and alone, you know,

756
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:21,120
at the end of the day. And all these experiences, he pays attention to them and he connects them to

757
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:30,800
broader patterns, broader trends in culture, in society, in technology. And that is really valuable,

758
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:37,840
I think. He keeps, he doesn't keep the discussion of private experiences at that level, at that

759
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:43,120
scope, at that original scope of interest. Yes, of course, we're interested in it, but

760
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:49,120
he helps us make sense of it by putting it in a larger context and different contexts. And

761
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:57,520
with the help of different thinkers, he introduces us to a host of other valuable thinkers like Foucault,

762
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:07,360
Plato, Nietzsche, Arendt, Hannah Arendt, and he's very good at connecting the

763
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:12,880
moments in our thought, in a discussion, with the right moments, the right person,

764
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:22,880
and bringing a passage, a quotation. He really has an, he's very artful in the use of quotations,

765
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:30,960
in the use of references. So that style, that general style, I think, is a great contribution.

766
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:41,680
He also highlights these structures that we are participating in. And becoming aware of these

767
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:46,720
structures, I think, is very helpful. We won't forget those structures that he's talking about.

768
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:57,120
And then, like any good thinker, he also has his maybe points where we can critically engage with

769
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:05,360
him and respond to him. But that's, you know, that's part of the journey. Indeed. I don't

770
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:10,240
know if I, if I responded to your question. No, you absolutely did. In fact, just on that note,

771
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:16,720
you even, in one, in a couple of your book reviews, you do, you are critical. You do say,

772
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:23,600
yeah, that this is probably not, not my favorite book of hands. Yeah, I think that's, that's,

773
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:30,480
you hit the nail on the head, David, because for me, I think people who read a lot of self-help books,

774
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:35,920
they would really benefit from reading Marshall Hahn, because what he makes, he makes the

775
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:42,160
private social, he shows how the private is political, that what we think are these private

776
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:48,480
struggles, they, they, they are social struggles, that they're, they're a result of the society

777
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:56,000
we live in. So I think that's a beautiful place to conclude. And at the moments where he says,

778
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,640
okay, if you just, you might think that if you just push hard enough, you will get to the,

779
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:05,040
to the bright side, you will get to the, you will solve it, you know, if you just

780
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,960
optimize yourself enough, but that's part of it. But that's not, that's not

781
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:15,040
the solution. That's, that's part of the structure of the problem.

782
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,840
The solution itself is part of the problem. Yeah.

783
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,440
That's right. That's right. The promise of the solution is a false promise.

784
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:27,840
Thank you, David. I hope this is the first of many more conversations to come between

785
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,640
me. I hope so too. Thank you. I hope so too. Thank you so much.
