00:00.000 --> 00:03.480
And I know you don't like compliments, but I'm an evil guy, so I'm going to compliment

00:03.480 --> 00:04.480
you.

00:04.480 --> 00:11.600
My favorite theories of love ever since I started reading philosophy was Alain Bajos,

00:11.600 --> 00:13.640
and then it was Todd McGavin's.

00:13.640 --> 00:19.640
And now I'd unequivocally say it's yours, the way you've articulated it in your book.

00:19.640 --> 00:25.080
It is, I don't even know where else to go from there, as in the way you laid down the

00:25.080 --> 00:29.240
entirety of love around like loss and this dying and negativity.

00:29.240 --> 00:36.000
But just again, I know you've spoken about this in a couple of places, but yeah, through

00:36.000 --> 00:43.400
your framework of let's say, or worldview of depressive realism and negative philosophy,

00:43.400 --> 00:45.400
what is love?

00:45.400 --> 00:47.600
Thank you.

00:47.600 --> 00:55.120
So love is comprehended in everything else from the negative perspective as the based

00:55.120 --> 01:03.440
on negativity, trauma, love, lack and all of those who love as dramatic and at the same

01:03.440 --> 01:13.120
time impossible in its nature, love as suicidal, self-destructive and the very connection between

01:13.120 --> 01:14.800
others.

01:14.800 --> 01:25.160
What structures the bond, the romantic bond, love relationship is the rupture between us,

01:25.160 --> 01:30.800
which destroys us at the same time and creates the connection.

01:30.800 --> 01:36.720
So when you reach the core of love, it hurts and you die.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.480
And maybe the other person also dies.

01:39.480 --> 01:46.000
And the healthy relationship was considered the healthy relationship in psychotherapeutic

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
society.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.960
I think it's just concealing enough, this painful, impossible core of love for us not to notice

01:54.960 --> 01:55.960
it.

01:55.960 --> 02:03.600
But I'm sure people know that healthy relationship, they're very boring and they don't feel like

02:03.600 --> 02:04.600
love.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.600
That's the problem.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.960
Like you can have it.

02:07.960 --> 02:13.360
It's not a problem to have a healthy relationship, it's just super boring and it's not love.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.840
What we call love, unfortunately, is just a very cruel joke.

02:17.840 --> 02:24.560
It's when you're dying into it, when you encounter the impossibility of it, it's the only way

02:24.560 --> 02:35.440
to feel it, which is super horrifying, especially for the Valentine's Day and the revelation.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.800
The isolation also doesn't help.

02:37.800 --> 02:47.720
The other is the one who hurts and we only feel them in a way, I think, that they hurt

02:47.720 --> 02:48.720
us.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.640
The other is the one that hurts in us.

02:51.640 --> 02:58.680
The isolation would be also not the protection from it, maybe protection, but also a certain

02:58.680 --> 03:03.040
type of social bond that also hurts the other hurt.

03:03.040 --> 03:12.000
You can constitute relation with them by isolating yourself from them and being isolated, it's

03:12.000 --> 03:18.280
still the condition that hurts because you're isolated precisely.

03:18.280 --> 03:23.560
You also feel the bond with the other through pain.

03:23.720 --> 03:33.720
The attachment theory, which gives the hope of healthy relationship, of healthy attachment type.

03:33.720 --> 03:39.480
I think that in each principle, it's like we hope that the healthy one doesn't hurt.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.160
It's the best one.

03:42.160 --> 03:51.480
And I think that it hurts, but when you just reduce it, conceal it enough.

03:51.560 --> 04:02.200
The pain, when it starts to be boring, then it's just possible to bearable, but it just

04:02.200 --> 04:05.400
doesn't feel that there is a connection anymore.

04:05.400 --> 04:10.760
It's presently bearable because it's not the attachment that might be concealed.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.120
Yeah.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.040
So Peter Rollins, I didn't mention him too.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.920
He too really influenced my thinking on the idea of love around loss.

04:20.240 --> 04:25.600
So for him, he articulates this quite well in the previous conversations we had.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.080
He said that, which I love this.

04:28.080 --> 04:33.520
He says communion is building a community around a shared loss.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.000
And well, I'll just put it this way.

04:38.000 --> 04:46.960
What are your just intimations on that idea that loving is kind of feeling this loss,

04:46.960 --> 04:49.840
ontological loss within us?

04:50.800 --> 04:54.640
And yeah, does that sit along with your philosophy too?

04:55.280 --> 04:57.120
Or would you radicalize that even further?

04:58.960 --> 05:06.720
Yeah, Peter Rollins distinguishes, which is great between community and communion.

05:06.720 --> 05:11.840
Community would be more a conventional way of people getting together because they share

05:11.840 --> 05:17.280
something, like they share enemies or a certain goal, a certain identification,

05:17.280 --> 05:18.720
they have something in common.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.600
He doesn't like it and he suggests what he creates is communion.

05:24.800 --> 05:32.240
When people share nothing, loss, luck, and this would be authentic relation.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.320
I would radicalize it.

05:35.280 --> 05:46.960
I think in a way that presents itself as this is a proper way of how things supposed to be.

05:47.920 --> 05:57.680
And I would think of trying to think of a therapy as the communion instead of treatment,

05:57.680 --> 06:05.040
instead of fixing someone, instead of hierarchy of bringing to a certain healthier

06:05.040 --> 06:09.120
conditional improvement, like the communion, sharing nothing.

06:11.040 --> 06:17.360
There still has hope to it that this is a happy thing, the way it's supposed to be,

06:17.360 --> 06:20.800
if one thinks about love in these terms.

06:20.800 --> 06:27.040
It gives the hope that there is a way, what we have to do and that it brings harmony

06:27.680 --> 06:32.240
something, that there is a luck and we need to connect through this luck.

06:32.240 --> 06:37.520
And then it's going to be authentic, equalized with a harmonious, happy relationship.

06:38.960 --> 06:43.200
To be honest, I don't think there is happy.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.000
Like this is harmonious relationship.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.560
I think it's also one of the ways, one of the illusions, how we would like, we would like

06:54.560 --> 06:59.920
to hope that it exists, but it doesn't.

07:01.200 --> 07:07.200
And still talking about how it should be done, it's still trying.

07:07.200 --> 07:11.280
We are connecting, I think, ontologically through it.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.280
There is no other ways to connect.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.960
It's not what we have to do.

07:14.960 --> 07:18.640
It's like maybe comforting illusion in a way.

07:18.640 --> 07:24.000
It's like training a cat who are impossible to train to sit, for example.

07:24.560 --> 07:29.040
And telling the cat to sit when the cat is already sitting.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.360
You know, it sits, it starts to sit.

07:31.360 --> 07:35.360
You tell it to sit and you have illusion that the cat obeys,

07:35.360 --> 07:39.440
where it's just your operation upon the cat to comfort you.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.480
This is a similar thing with what we have to do with love.

07:45.040 --> 07:49.280
It's already there in a horrifying way.

07:49.280 --> 07:55.200
There is nothing you can do or you have to do to make it better or to do it properly.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.000
It's not the problem.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.360
It's just different comprehension, maybe.

08:02.560 --> 08:08.880
Either you discuss love and trying to figure out the correct form of love that would bring

08:08.880 --> 08:14.560
happiness, won't hurt anyone or hurt less, or you just horrified of love.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.240
That's what I'm rather young.

08:16.560 --> 08:27.520
It's presence in inevitable nature and a horror of it without trying to anymore escaping into

08:27.520 --> 08:32.160
how to fix something or what's the correct form of attachment.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.520
Just horrified without escaping from it.

08:36.320 --> 08:44.240
And I'm not saying that this is how the proper way to think about it is the certain state of

08:44.240 --> 08:45.120
my existence.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.240
Yeah, I do like what Jojak says.

08:48.240 --> 08:52.080
I think in one of his, it's probably in a documentary, in one of the Pervod's guides

08:52.080 --> 08:56.960
documentaries, he says that love is a disaster, it's a catastrophe.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.240
But then there's also when I'm not in love, I'm sad.

09:00.720 --> 09:05.200
So it's like, whereas you're saying both when you're in love and not in love,

09:05.200 --> 09:07.280
you're going to be sad, you're going to be irregardless.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.080
Just face the catastrophe, so to speak.

09:10.400 --> 09:18.400
Yeah, so I think that the, and Kierkegaard, one who knew that you both get married and

09:18.400 --> 09:19.920
don't get married, you regret.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.920
We have the hope for being saved.

09:23.920 --> 09:30.560
Simone de Boire talks about women who treat men as the form of salvation,

09:30.560 --> 09:31.600
the most immediate one.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.680
When you're alone, you're expecting for men to save you.

09:36.080 --> 09:43.600
And one, this disillusion once you're in a relationship, because it's, you're in a

09:43.600 --> 09:45.200
relationship, but no one is saving you.

09:46.240 --> 09:53.120
Encounter the horror of being in a relationship, being disillusioned in this salvation.

09:53.120 --> 09:53.840
It's not heaven.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.120
Didn't work.

09:55.680 --> 10:02.480
So you, once you are not in a relationship, you expect to get rid of the horror of being

10:02.480 --> 10:04.800
alone while you're in a relationship.

10:04.800 --> 10:10.720
And in relationship, the other way around, you expect to be saved of the horror of

10:10.720 --> 10:15.760
relationship, ending relationship, or proceeding to find someone else better,

10:15.760 --> 10:16.880
something like it.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.800
But it's the horror every time.

10:18.800 --> 10:24.480
It just, for a while, you remember the previous horror, the previous type of horror.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.080
And you think that this is improvement.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.320
It helps you to hold on for a while.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.680
Then you forget about it.

10:29.680 --> 10:33.600
It's like encounter a horror of this situation, of relationship, for example.

10:33.600 --> 10:39.280
And then you're hoping for opposite salvation in the end of relationship.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.480
It just never comes.

10:40.480 --> 10:46.240
So it's both horror of, when we are in relationship, we get dressed from the

10:46.240 --> 10:51.280
previous type of horror and then the dialectics forever.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.920
Or you just get adapted to a certain type of horror.

10:56.800 --> 11:01.040
Being alone or being with someone, the tolerable horror.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.240
And you settle.
