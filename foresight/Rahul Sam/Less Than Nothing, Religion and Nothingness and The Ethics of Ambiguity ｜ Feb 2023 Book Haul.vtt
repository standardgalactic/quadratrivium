00:00.000 --> 00:07.680
Hey everyone, welcome to my February 2023 book haul video. This is a new series that I started

00:07.680 --> 00:13.760
which is very casual, completely unscripted where I just go through the books that I've bought

00:13.760 --> 00:19.600
for the month. I tend to do a book haul every single month and I thought, hey, why not share

00:19.600 --> 00:26.640
what I'm buying? Hopefully it adds as an impetus or some sort of inspiration for you to read some

00:26.640 --> 00:32.720
of these books and delve into some of these thinkers. I certainly love watching other people's

00:32.720 --> 00:38.480
book haul videos. It's something I get a lot of just, it's kind of like eating fast food for me,

00:38.480 --> 00:44.880
just pure stimulation and pleasure from looking at all the books that people buy because I happen

00:44.880 --> 00:52.080
to be a bibliophile and fanatical one, in fact. And you know, apart from that, I'll probably

00:52.080 --> 00:58.640
will discuss why I chose to buy this particular book in this point in my life, what's the reason

00:58.640 --> 01:03.920
that I'm interested in this particular book or this thinker and whatnot. But again, it's nothing

01:04.880 --> 01:09.680
planned, it's nothing scripted, it's just me, stream of consciousness just talking, that's it.

01:10.960 --> 01:18.240
Without further ado, let's get started. So the first book is Phenomenology, The Basics by

01:19.200 --> 01:24.720
Dan Zahavi, I believe that's how you pronounce his name. I literally found this book over at it.

01:25.760 --> 01:32.160
I kind of went through this before, I think I got a PDF or something, but I did refer to this a

01:32.160 --> 01:39.200
couple of times when I was writing a few essays. And obviously Phenomenology, a topic that I'm

01:39.200 --> 01:44.800
deeply interested in, I think I'm essentially a phenomenologist and many other things, but that's

01:44.800 --> 01:53.600
one thing I am for sure. And though it's funny, I bought this book because I'm currently writing an

01:53.600 --> 02:03.360
essay that I started writing out of sheer annoyance at James Lindsay, this guy is kind of like right

02:03.360 --> 02:13.120
wing anti woke person who said that all phenomenology is so he said that all leftism is just an

02:13.920 --> 02:20.960
is a byproduct. Oh, leftism is inspired by this philosophical phenomenology, which simply asserts

02:20.960 --> 02:28.400
that subjectivity is truth. And I saw that and I thought that is completely not true. That is

02:28.400 --> 02:34.000
just that is that's a that's fake news. And I could really annoyed me, you can probably see even now,

02:34.000 --> 02:39.760
I read this tweet like months ago, but even now I got totally annoyed by that because it's a complete

02:39.760 --> 02:47.360
caricature and mischaracterization of what phenomenology is. And therefore I started writing

02:47.360 --> 02:54.640
this essay called what phenomenology is not. So I want to kind of try to understand phenomenology

02:55.280 --> 03:01.280
by what what it isn't. I feel like it's funny. I think the more I've started to delve into

03:01.280 --> 03:06.560
philosophy and theory, I've realized that sometimes the best way to grok a concept and understand a

03:06.560 --> 03:13.440
concept is by stating what it isn't, instead of stating what it is. In some sense, even at least

03:13.440 --> 03:20.160
for me, it kind of sits better in my mind. So I bought this book, I'm certainly going to get to

03:20.160 --> 03:27.520
this soon. And the reason is because I want to hopefully publish that publish that essay,

03:29.200 --> 03:34.240
perhaps in about two months, because I'm working on another one right now, got too many, too many

03:35.040 --> 03:39.120
essays pulling me from all sides. And you know, I'm really not getting anything done,

03:39.120 --> 03:44.320
unfortunately. That's just something that I tend to worry about quite a lot.

03:45.920 --> 03:51.760
Ah, the pleasures. So that's why I bought this book. It's in fact to write an essay. I want to get

03:51.760 --> 04:02.640
through all the basics as the name suggests. And my next book is an event perhaps a biography of

04:02.640 --> 04:08.320
Jacques Darida by Peter Salomon, a Salomon, sorry, not not Salomon, Peter Salomon. And

04:08.320 --> 04:16.640
this was recommended by R.C. Walden, if I could find the video where he did recommend the book.

04:19.920 --> 04:26.880
So I think it was called R.C. Walden, Continental Philosophy or something. Let me see if I could

04:26.880 --> 04:33.120
find the video. So I love watching R.C. Robin, that's his name, Robin's videos.

04:34.480 --> 04:38.240
David, you have five interesting philosophy books, Continental Edition,

04:38.880 --> 04:42.400
and he recommended the book. I'm pretty sure he recommended this book.

04:43.600 --> 04:51.920
Yes, and even perhaps. So I kind of want to get into Darida and kind of post structuralist

04:52.640 --> 04:59.680
way of thinking. I really at the moment just have like a very, very extremely peripheral,

04:59.680 --> 05:05.840
almost caricatured version of what post structuralism is. And I thought something,

05:05.840 --> 05:12.080
something I really enjoy is, you know, as Nietzsche said, all philosophy is a philosopher's

05:12.080 --> 05:17.360
biography is even before delving into the philosopher, just sorry, the philosophy,

05:18.320 --> 05:23.840
trying getting an idea from where the philosopher's coming from, which is rather

05:23.840 --> 05:28.880
antithetical to what Heidegger said about Aristotle, that he was just someone who was born,

05:28.880 --> 05:34.640
philosophers and died. No, I actually am interested in the philosopher. I don't know why, but

05:35.520 --> 05:41.280
that's who I am. I generally am interested in the thinker and the background as to what,

05:42.080 --> 05:46.640
the background in which the philosophy sits. So not just the thinker itself,

05:46.640 --> 05:51.120
but even the context, the historical context, the culture period, all of that.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.920
So yeah, I'm kind of getting into this. I probably will get down with this first before

05:55.920 --> 06:00.960
getting into this because this is a small, well, I'm assuming it's a bit of a lie to read compared

06:00.960 --> 06:07.920
to like reading theory, say, because it's a biography. But anyway, that's that. The next one

06:07.920 --> 06:15.440
is was a gift. It was Far From the Madden Crowd by Thomas Hardy. I don't own any books by Thomas,

06:15.440 --> 06:20.240
I think at least I don't think I do. And I kind of want to read Thomas Hardy, just like a light

06:20.240 --> 06:25.680
read. I love reading philosophy, but at the same time, I really do want to read a lot more fiction.

06:26.320 --> 06:34.160
But man, I'm just such a theory nerd, you know, I can't help myself. I probably read like one

06:34.720 --> 06:40.320
work. I probably like read like one novel, but even that, like if I read Dostoevsky, for instance,

06:40.320 --> 06:46.000
I want to read it from like a philosophical lens. I can't just read it as a book or as a work of fiction

06:46.720 --> 06:52.800
because I'm such a theory nerd. But nonetheless, this is a book was recommended by a few friends.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.720
I hope that it was quite good. And I hope that it kind of goes into

06:57.440 --> 07:05.200
as the what's this called bibliography state, so vividly portraying the

07:05.840 --> 07:12.160
superstitions and traditions of a small, rural community far from the madden crowd

07:12.160 --> 07:17.760
shows the precarious position of a woman in a man's world. So it certainly seems interesting.

07:18.960 --> 07:26.400
And then this book. Now, The Ethics of Ambiguity by Simone de Beauvoir. Of course, everyone knows

07:26.400 --> 07:30.480
who Simone de Beauvoir is, at least anyone who's marginally interested in philosophy.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.760
Simone de Beauvoir, of course, is known for her magnum opus, the second sex, but

07:37.440 --> 07:44.400
a lot of YouTubers, in fact, philosophy YouTubers that I deeply respect, have recommended this

07:44.400 --> 07:51.840
book because at least from my understanding, I think Simone de Beauvoir has a much more

07:51.920 --> 07:58.640
reasonable, let's say, or I haven't got the word for it, but let's just say

07:59.440 --> 08:03.680
realistic and take that word with a grain of salt. I don't know if that's a proper word.

08:03.680 --> 08:13.600
Realistic, let's say like encapsulation of reality, if that makes sense, or what life is

08:14.160 --> 08:20.960
for a human being, for a design. Because you know, Jean-Paul Sartre, he kind of

08:21.600 --> 08:25.120
has this idea of like the transcendent consciousness that is free-floating,

08:25.120 --> 08:30.720
consciousness everywhere. But given that Simone de Beauvoir was a woman in a time where I believe

08:30.720 --> 08:35.360
when she was writing, women couldn't even work without getting permission from men or something.

08:35.360 --> 08:43.200
But even in France, it was a very progressive country for the time. Nonetheless,

08:43.760 --> 08:50.400
she lived in a deeply patriarchal system. Therefore, her understanding,

08:51.760 --> 08:58.000
her understanding of what it means to exist in the world, especially being a woman,

08:58.880 --> 09:02.720
I think is a lot more realistic because she talks about this kind of contradiction between

09:02.720 --> 09:07.680
being a free being, but also the fact that we are, in fact, in a structure, in a society,

09:08.240 --> 09:14.960
in a historical period, we also have this kind of, there's a word by

09:15.840 --> 09:21.440
po-to-lik, there's a term by po-to-lik. Let me try to look it up because I just referred to it.

09:29.200 --> 09:34.480
It's in this, oh, I think it was masculinity and nothingness. Yes, so in this essay I did quote

09:34.480 --> 09:44.080
po-to-lik. Let me see if I could find it. Man is essentially finite freedom. This idea of finite

09:44.080 --> 09:54.400
freedom, that doesn't mean we're not free, but our freedom comes within a certain structure that,

09:54.400 --> 10:01.440
in some sense, makes the freedom infinity. It's not like this free-floating Sartrean consciousness

10:01.520 --> 10:07.840
that we just can do whatever we want. Perhaps Sartre wrote from a position of privilege,

10:07.840 --> 10:14.320
being a man in France in his time. Simone de Beauvoir had a different experience being a woman.

10:15.600 --> 10:24.240
This book beautifully captures that ambiguity to existence, this kind of almost antagonism

10:24.240 --> 10:30.320
of what it means to be human, and then, of course, the ethical and moral implications that come from

10:30.400 --> 10:35.920
it. So I'm really keen to get into this. This is probably going to go right to the top of my list

10:35.920 --> 10:44.880
of books to read. Perhaps once I'm done with this one, because I'm writing an essay, I'll probably

10:44.880 --> 10:51.280
get on this. So suddenly excited to read The Ethics of Pembergute by Simone de Beauvoir.

10:52.080 --> 11:00.800
And then comes the next one. So it's This Big Boy, Less Than Nothing by my hero,

11:00.800 --> 11:08.720
Slavoj Džek. This is a book that I will jump into this year for sure. The reason being,

11:09.280 --> 11:16.160
this year I kind of set myself a goal in terms of my education and my studying

11:16.160 --> 11:28.160
in philosophy. It was to deeply study two of, well, I would say the two main thinkers that

11:28.160 --> 11:34.880
have influenced my life to this moment in the deepest possible way. Portolek and, of course,

11:34.880 --> 11:42.160
Slavoj Džek. So studying these two thinkers, of course, means studying all the other thinkers

11:42.160 --> 11:48.400
that influenced them. So it's a huge project that I've set for myself. And I want to embark on it.

11:48.400 --> 11:55.600
And I'm kind of already embarked on it, let's say. And that means going through essentially

11:56.720 --> 12:03.520
the magnum opuses. So for Portolek it would be, I probably would be systematic theology,

12:03.520 --> 12:09.200
the monograph. It's got three volumes. And I own it too. I just am slowly getting through that.

12:09.200 --> 12:14.000
But then for Slavoj Džek, a lot of people who read Džek quite deeply recommend this book

12:14.720 --> 12:21.120
and the parallax view. So this is his book on Hegel. Hegel and the shadow of dialectical

12:21.120 --> 12:25.280
materialism. So this is certainly something I'm going to jump into soon because I won't

12:25.280 --> 12:30.640
get a better understanding of Hegel. I don't know. It's funny. I just had a conversation with

12:31.200 --> 12:37.040
P.F. Young, a great guy, Paul. And I realized that I was trying to explain to him the Hegelian

12:38.080 --> 12:43.360
triad. And I think I totally butchered it. I wasn't even sure if I should take that bit out

12:43.360 --> 12:49.760
because I didn't want to misrepresent Hegel. But I just thought, hey, look, it's a conversation.

12:49.760 --> 12:55.040
We were just chatting. It was really casual. So if I'm just spewing bullshit,

12:55.040 --> 13:00.320
someone will correct me and if I'm not, I'll hopefully correct myself sometime in the future

13:00.320 --> 13:06.480
when I have a better understanding of Hegel. So definitely I'm going to work on this. In fact,

13:07.040 --> 13:14.240
if it's possible, it's a big boy. I might even do a lecture series on this book

13:15.040 --> 13:22.320
if it's within my capacity because, man, it's a lot to get through. The next one is

13:22.320 --> 13:30.320
Religion and Nothingness by Nishitani, Keiji Nishitani. Of course, a book that

13:30.320 --> 13:35.600
John Oveiki has recommended many times. In fact, in his latest lecture series, which is

13:38.160 --> 13:46.000
what was it? After Socrates, is it? Oveiki. Yes, in his lecture series,

13:46.880 --> 13:55.440
I think in episode five, he states that this was in the top five books that he's read.

13:56.160 --> 14:02.000
And John Oveiki is also someone I really like. I really enjoy listening to his work.

14:02.000 --> 14:10.800
Despite interestingly, I think theoretically, his point of views or his understanding of reality

14:10.880 --> 14:17.040
is a lot more different to the other thinker that I would consider myself a Zhezhekian.

14:17.040 --> 14:26.240
So, Zhezhek and John Oveiki probably have this fundamental conflict in their theories.

14:28.080 --> 14:33.840
It's interesting just to go for a bit of a tangent here. I think a lot of the modern debate

14:33.920 --> 14:41.440
between different intellectuals is kind of between Freud, and then there's Jung, and then there's

14:41.440 --> 14:48.640
Lacan. And I think it's between these three thinkers. So, everyone influenced by Freud,

14:48.640 --> 14:53.440
Jung, Lacan, they go their own way and create their own philosophies. And that's where the conflict

14:53.440 --> 14:59.440
lies. So, John Oveiki would probably be more of a union, less than a Freudian, and then

15:00.000 --> 15:06.720
Zhezhek would be more of a Freudian and Lacanian. So, or Lacanian. So, that's where the conflict lies.

15:08.880 --> 15:15.280
Nonetheless, just thinking out loud here. The next book is Capital by Thomas Piketty.

15:17.520 --> 15:24.640
I listened to a recent episode on Pillspawd. I love this channel so much. I don't know the

15:24.640 --> 15:32.480
guy's real name. I don't think he probably goes by his pseudonym online, Pillspawd. And they

15:33.200 --> 15:41.120
had this episode where they talk about, it's called the idea of communism. It's very interesting. It

15:41.120 --> 15:46.880
was in fact done on a, I believe, an event that Alan Baizho and a few other thinkers, you know,

15:46.880 --> 15:51.040
mainstream leftists, or the popular leftist intellectuals of our time, got together and

15:51.040 --> 15:55.680
discussed the idea of communism. So, it's important to understand here. It's the word idea. That's

15:55.680 --> 16:00.080
the concept of communism. It's not about the practical implementations. Different thing.

16:01.760 --> 16:09.360
And they did mention this book. Not Pillspawd, but another guest on the podcast did mention

16:09.360 --> 16:15.680
this book, Capital by Thomas Piketty. And I know it's another big one. I don't know if I'll get

16:15.680 --> 16:22.320
into it this year. Hopefully. Definitely, I want to first get through the next book on Hegel.

16:22.320 --> 16:28.160
But maybe after that, I'll get into this book. And the reason I like it is because,

16:28.160 --> 16:33.200
as much as I love philosophy and concepts, I also do look for, you know, practical material

16:33.200 --> 16:37.440
implementations of these concepts. It's something, you know, I think, as a person who's politically

16:37.440 --> 16:42.080
involved has to think about, it can't all be philosophizing at one point. It has to be

16:42.080 --> 16:48.560
implementation. This is perhaps my engineering side coming in. And they discussed that Thomas Piketty

16:48.560 --> 16:57.120
just gives some very tangible, practical solutions as to how we can live in a post-capitalist

16:57.120 --> 17:04.320
society. As to how we can implement new systems that make society more egalitarian and ensure

17:04.320 --> 17:11.040
that there's less suffering in this world. And it's a new way of thinking about capital,

17:11.040 --> 17:15.840
as the name suggests, in the 21st century, because we do live in a post-capitalist society.

17:15.840 --> 17:21.680
And I think society is, you know, I mean, over here, I'm a complete jirkeen. I think the only

17:21.680 --> 17:27.520
universal is conflict. I think the only universal is antagonism. So in some sense, in a very

17:27.520 --> 17:33.200
Nietzschean way, society is about constantly recreating ourselves and then broader society.

17:33.200 --> 17:40.560
There never is the good old days, nor will there ever be the utopia that some people might aspire

17:40.560 --> 17:51.120
to have. Therefore, there never is the end of history. That never happens, as Francis Fukuyama

17:52.480 --> 17:58.560
suggested. At least that's my current understanding. And that's it. Those are the books. I hope you all

17:58.560 --> 18:06.000
enjoyed this book haul. Sorry if I'm blabbering. I kind of did that intentionally because, well,

18:06.000 --> 18:10.320
this is not a scripted thing. It's just me thinking out loud here. And if there are any other books,

18:10.400 --> 18:18.400
that you think are, let's say, tangentially related to these books that I discussed, please do leave

18:18.400 --> 18:23.840
them down in the comment section. And I'll be keen to check them out and perhaps even end up buying

18:23.840 --> 18:28.800
them. But thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next one, not only the next book haul, but even

18:28.800 --> 18:36.240
in the next video, which probably, well, I've got one on my mother world, the software engineering

18:36.240 --> 18:44.480
world where I'm doing on effective Java, which I shall record soon. And then the other one is a,

18:45.120 --> 18:51.120
I'm excited for this, actually, a Twitter space that I'll be hosting, not hosting, sorry, I'll be a

18:51.120 --> 18:57.040
guest in with my brother, you and go, who I'm hoping to have on the podcast soon because this guy,

18:57.760 --> 19:02.720
alone to death, but also the smart bloke. So it would be interesting to have a conversation

19:02.720 --> 19:08.720
with him. Cool. See you in the next one. Take care. Cheers.
