00:00.000 --> 00:07.720
Hey everyone, welcome to my May 2023 book haul video. This one in particular, I'm gonna be quite happy.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.720
My frugal ass is gonna be quite happy.

00:10.280 --> 00:14.560
Specifically because of this pile here. I've got more books, but this pile here is

00:15.240 --> 00:21.880
is making my frugal ass very happy given that all of this costed just I think less than $20.

00:21.880 --> 00:27.200
So I got some some great books here, and I only paid 20 bucks for all of this thanks to

00:27.680 --> 00:35.240
secondhand shopping that I went with with with a few friends. In fact, I looked up this sociology book.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.960
It's just like a kind of like not a textbook really, but more as the title suggests the key concepts

00:41.720 --> 00:47.760
by Rotolidge. It was on Amazon for 35 bucks. I got this for less than five dollars, I think so

00:48.560 --> 00:50.560
that is fantastic. I

00:50.920 --> 00:57.160
highly highly recommend secondhand book shopping. It's not really something I've done a lot given that some of the books that I do buy

00:57.480 --> 00:59.400
to be rather

00:59.400 --> 01:01.400
what's it would not not as popular

01:01.840 --> 01:04.760
as some like let's say a Jane Austen or a Charles Dickens.

01:05.640 --> 01:10.960
So it's kind of hard to find exactly what I want outside of buying it from from Amazon or some

01:11.400 --> 01:13.400
large bookseller.

01:13.520 --> 01:20.640
But man, what I really do enjoy about secondhand book shopping is that kind of like spontaneity where you just pick up great books by

01:21.200 --> 01:26.080
authors that you've been reading for a while and then you get it for like two bucks. It's fantastic.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.200
Okay, let's start off. The first book is I've already

01:29.800 --> 01:33.960
started this book as you can see from the bookmark. You actually can't see that. There you go.

01:34.480 --> 01:38.000
It's Alan Kazupanchek's What Is Sex?

01:38.520 --> 01:43.800
Man, I've only read like what 10 pages so far because I'm trying really quite slowly and really

01:44.480 --> 01:45.440
really

01:45.440 --> 01:48.560
led the idea to settle in me because

01:49.240 --> 01:51.080
you know

01:51.080 --> 01:55.640
sexuality, sex, these words are very loaded terms, but they're kind of the philosophical

01:56.080 --> 01:59.720
and even ontological approach Alan Kazupanchek is taking in this book.

02:00.240 --> 02:08.240
It's it's at least for me being a neo-fight. It seems rather unorthodox and I'm trying to like let the ideas really settle

02:08.560 --> 02:10.240
and

02:10.240 --> 02:13.240
kind of battle with them in some sense and

02:14.320 --> 02:19.560
in fact, I'll be doing a book review on this for sure because I think it's a topic worth discussing

02:20.720 --> 02:22.720
particularly given the current political climate.

02:23.720 --> 02:29.880
The next book is now, you know, okay, I'll take both books out. In fact, Todd McGovern, his

02:30.200 --> 02:35.680
Emancipation After Hegel and his other book Capitalism and Desire. This book, I've read parts of it,

02:35.880 --> 02:42.120
but I want to get through the whole thing. This one, I haven't and man, I am excited for this because

02:42.280 --> 02:49.440
so for instance, here's a review that Slavoj Zizek wrote on this book Emancipation After Hegel. Here's what he said.

02:50.360 --> 02:59.520
This is the book we were waiting for after long years of being bombarded by Hegel as a clotted liberal whose last word is recognition.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.400
With Todd McGovern,

03:02.400 --> 03:04.400
the revolutionary Hegel is back.

03:04.680 --> 03:09.200
However, it is not the old Marxist Hegel, but the Hegel After Marx.

03:09.680 --> 03:15.200
The Hegel who makes us aware that revolution is an open and risk process

03:15.920 --> 03:19.200
which necessarily entails catastrophic failures.

03:20.080 --> 03:26.520
Hegel's problem, how to save the legacy of the French Revolution after its breakdown is our problem today.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.920
How to save the project of radical emancipation

03:30.400 --> 03:34.640
after the catastrophe of starvinism in a truly democratic country.

03:35.480 --> 03:43.920
Emancipation After Hegel would be reprinted in hundreds of thousands of copies and distributed for free to all students.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.480
Read this book or ignore it at your own risk.

03:47.480 --> 03:52.920
I really like the last sentence because generally Zizek isn't a very kind of prescriptive thinker.

03:52.920 --> 03:57.160
He never tells you what to do. He's more like a he's a critique and an analyst and

03:57.680 --> 04:02.800
the fact that he said read this book or ignore it at your own risk, it gives very

04:03.360 --> 04:05.360
Jordan Peterson vibes, in fact.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.800
But now I certainly am going to get to this soon. In fact, I think after

04:09.520 --> 04:12.360
too much to read, but I think after what is sex,

04:13.320 --> 04:17.880
I'm going to read the emancipation after Hegel, not really even for the political aspects of it, but

04:18.600 --> 04:20.440
man, I've been so

04:20.440 --> 04:24.280
just obsessed with this idea of contradiction the past couple of months.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.280
It's been taking up all of my thinking

04:26.920 --> 04:33.960
to probably an unhealthy level because I'm trying to analyze everything via that lens of Hegelian contradiction.

04:34.520 --> 04:37.000
Okay, so yeah, that's that book and then of course

04:37.560 --> 04:39.400
capitalism and desire.

04:39.480 --> 04:44.520
One of my, I'd say one of my personal goals in life, kind of like a dream is to get

04:46.120 --> 04:49.400
Tom McGovern on my podcast and discuss this book

04:50.120 --> 04:51.720
and particularly

04:51.720 --> 04:53.720
let him elucidate as to why

04:54.200 --> 04:57.160
Marxists really need to take psychoanalysis seriously.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.960
So I'm gonna, yeah, try and work towards that and aspire towards that, but I think

05:02.520 --> 05:08.600
I haven't even reached out to him yet, but before I do reach out, I think I need to attune myself more with this work and give it a bit more time

05:08.920 --> 05:10.920
before having a conversation with him.

05:11.720 --> 05:15.400
And the next book is Adrian Johnston's Džek's Ontology.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.080
This is also something, obviously, given that I'm a huge Džek here.

05:19.160 --> 05:24.600
I would certainly want to read soon, although I think this book is gonna wait till the end of the year

05:24.680 --> 05:27.720
because I want to get through some of Tom McGovern's and Zupanček's work.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.280
And you know, given that Džek is this huge figure,

05:32.920 --> 05:34.920
Goliath of a figure in the

05:35.880 --> 05:40.040
Slovenian school of, Slovenian philosophers, you know, Džek,

05:40.840 --> 05:44.440
Zupanček, and in fact, I shouldn't even say that I should say

05:45.160 --> 05:51.240
more of the kind of the, these new Hegelians, the way people like McGovern or Adrian Johnston

05:51.880 --> 05:53.880
or of course Džek.

05:54.680 --> 05:59.960
Džek is such a daunting, towering figure that we tend to focus only on his work.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.320
So I want to try and focus a bit more on the other thinkers.

06:03.800 --> 06:10.360
Zupanček, McGovern, Johnston, before, not long before, why I'm also paying attention to Džek's work.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.920
It's also the fact that Džek is a prolific writer, so he just writes so much.

06:16.200 --> 06:21.240
Okay, I think I went through all of that. Yes. So now let's get to my other book pile.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.440
All of these were not really planned purchases. It's the best part of

06:25.480 --> 06:28.920
you know, going secondhand book shopping, you just pick up whatever's there.

06:29.640 --> 06:34.920
Yep, The Prophet by Khaled Gibran, my friend who I went with, she told me,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.080
she in fact read this book and she told me she hated it.

06:37.640 --> 06:42.920
But I do know some people really, really enjoy this book and it's kind of a very popular book.

06:43.480 --> 06:47.000
So I probably won't read it this year. Let's be honest, I'm reading some other stuff, but

06:47.000 --> 06:54.760
it's just always good to have in the collection. Ah, Jen Austen's Persuasions. I watched the film on Netflix.

06:55.160 --> 07:01.160
Wasn't impressed, wasn't impressed, because to be honest, I did quite like Pride and Prejudice.

07:01.160 --> 07:05.240
I thought it was quite good. But Persuasions, it wasn't all that good.

07:07.160 --> 07:14.680
The next book is Charles Dickens Great Expectations. This is, yeah, I want to get to this.

07:15.640 --> 07:22.520
Dickens, man, I think it's kind of hard because I really do want to spend at least six months

07:22.520 --> 07:26.920
getting through most of Charles Dickens's work, particularly because I think,

07:27.720 --> 07:31.320
even though I've only read Hard Times and what's the other one?

07:34.360 --> 07:38.440
I've read one other Dickens book. Doesn't matter. Hard Times for sure, but there's one on the book

07:38.440 --> 07:45.800
I've read. I feel like a lot of his thinking, I mean, obviously he's a literary figure, but

07:46.760 --> 07:53.800
at a philosophical level, at a sociological level, what he tries to delineate in his books

07:53.800 --> 08:00.040
is kind of what I try to theorize on in society and make sense of. So I gotta take him more seriously.

08:01.080 --> 08:07.000
And then another Jen Austen book, Sense and Sensibility. Honestly, I don't even know

08:07.000 --> 08:10.600
Jen Austen wrote a book called Sense and Sensibility. Yeah, I only picked it up when I saw

08:11.400 --> 08:17.800
her name and I really liked Jen Austen. So, oh, Charlotte Bronte's Jen Air. So

08:18.920 --> 08:23.800
is that how it's pronounced? Jen Air? Okay, this is really interesting. My friend, Tess, who,

08:23.800 --> 08:29.720
I don't think she minds me mentioning her name. She's been reading this book right now and she

08:29.720 --> 08:36.120
recently, I haven't, obviously, I love, love, love Wuthering Heights. So Charlotte Bronte's sister,

08:36.120 --> 08:42.360
Emily Bronte's book, her magnum opus, let's say. And therefore, I really want to get to

08:42.360 --> 08:47.720
Jen Air, too, or the Bronte sisters. I think that they're brilliant. So from this book,

08:47.720 --> 08:53.160
she shared this quote with me and I thought it was excellent. It's exactly why I like the Bronte's,

08:53.160 --> 09:00.760
because they're so, man, I like how crude and in some sense, so violent their writing is.

09:00.920 --> 09:08.200
It just, it's so, it's such good writing. So here's a line by, I think it's Jane saying this and

09:08.200 --> 09:15.480
she says, so Tess shared this with me. She says, I am not an angel. I asserted and I will not be one

09:15.480 --> 09:23.880
till I die. I will be myself, Mr. Rochester. You must neither expect nor exact anything

09:23.880 --> 09:27.720
so let's seal off me. Let me actually change the screen so you could read it too if

09:30.520 --> 09:36.120
so let's seal off me for you will not get it any more than I shall get it of you. So this is a

09:36.120 --> 09:40.760
small excerpt from Jen Air and I kind of tweeted it and I thought that was so good. I thought it was

09:40.760 --> 09:45.960
so good and I even commented the divine feminists cringe. It's yet another patriarchal idea that

09:45.960 --> 09:52.680
harms women. I totally agree. I am not a fan of any of this idealization of women as abstract figures.

09:52.680 --> 09:58.440
In fact, that's why I like, I think, even Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights because it just shows,

09:59.000 --> 10:05.080
well, love it, it's violence, but also the characters, they're such complex characters and

10:05.080 --> 10:12.440
it shows a dark side of both Heathcliff and is it Elizabeth? My god, I forgot. Yeah, and Elizabeth,

10:12.440 --> 10:18.920
it shows both the beauty and the ugly of these characters, which for me is what great literature

10:18.920 --> 10:24.680
does. And last but not least is this book here, The Sociology Key Concepts. I'll probably never

10:24.680 --> 10:31.080
read it. It's just more like a reference book that I'll probably use it as. And yeah, that's kind

10:31.080 --> 10:37.640
of it. Those are the books for this book haul. In terms of quantity, a bit more books than

10:37.720 --> 10:46.120
per usual. The recent being is because of, again, my great little second hand book shopping

10:48.440 --> 10:54.200
thing I did with my friends, which I'm really happy about. Alrighty, thanks for watching. I hope

10:54.200 --> 11:00.760
I, as per usual, gave you a few ideas, put a few books or authors in your mind, in your head

11:00.760 --> 11:06.120
that they'll hopefully be an impetus for you to go read these authors. But just if you're

11:06.120 --> 11:11.960
into philosophy like me, I would highly, highly recommend looking into the work of Todd McGovern.

11:11.960 --> 11:18.040
He is fantastic. And he also has a podcast. Let me pull that out too, in fact, while they're added.

11:19.640 --> 11:27.880
It's on Spotify. It's called Why Theory. It is really, really good, this podcast here.

11:27.880 --> 11:33.160
Why Theory goes through so many concepts and I've kind of been binge listening. I was going to say

11:33.160 --> 11:38.600
binge watching, but it's actually binge listening, this podcast. Sorry for the abrupt ending there.

11:38.600 --> 11:45.080
I clicked stop recording on OBS by mistake. Now, the proper ending. Thanks for watching. I'll see

11:45.080 --> 11:51.640
you in the next book haul video or the next video, which probably is going to be a little, little

11:51.640 --> 11:57.960
vlog slash analysis on Character Guard from this book, either or perhaps it's Magnum Opus

11:57.960 --> 12:05.240
on Bodom, which is going to be an interesting topic to discuss. Alrighty, see you in the next one. Cheers.
