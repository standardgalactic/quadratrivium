00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the NRLM podcast and today

00:04.760 --> 00:10.920
I'll be reading out guiding axiom number four that I wrote for my newsletter, The Unhappy Man.

00:10.920 --> 00:14.960
And in case you haven't been following these axioms that I've been

00:14.960 --> 00:19.880
animerating in the past couple episodes, essentially there were seven axioms I

00:19.880 --> 00:25.800
laid down for my newsletter, The Unhappy Man, as I did mention before. And I

00:25.800 --> 00:32.320
realized, wow, by me writing and thinking clearly, these axioms that I'm laying

00:32.320 --> 00:39.320
down really are a framework for all of my creative work. And that obviously includes

00:39.320 --> 00:44.480
this podcast and whatever, interviews, scripts, I don't know,

00:44.480 --> 00:49.920
dispositions, whatever I do on this podcast, I'm hoping to do it via these

00:49.920 --> 00:54.920
axioms, via this framework. And I certainly don't want it to be

00:55.280 --> 01:01.040
something that confines me or something that sort of, let's say, that doesn't

01:01.040 --> 01:06.320
allow me to, that shackles me. I'd rather hope that it's a good place to start

01:06.320 --> 01:10.800
from, and then open up into somewhere because I mean, I need some kind of stable

01:10.800 --> 01:15.520
footing. And that's why I thought it's wise and prudent, especially given my

01:15.520 --> 01:22.240
nature to get lost in obscure thoughts and sometimes nonsense. It's healthy to

01:22.240 --> 01:26.360
have some axioms, especially at a respectful reader or a listener in this

01:26.360 --> 01:35.520
case. So axiom number four, five, and six, I don't want to just do what I have

01:35.520 --> 01:40.120
been doing in the previous episodes, or the previous axioms that I've been

01:40.120 --> 01:43.480
reading out, where I've mostly been just reading it out of the essay I've

01:43.480 --> 01:49.360
written. Rather, I want to maybe pause in the middle, have a bit of commentary,

01:50.160 --> 01:54.800
expand as, you know, the good thing about a podcast is it allows me to do that.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.280
And I think the reason for that is because I realized, you know, laying down

01:59.280 --> 02:03.120
these axioms, because I wasn't writing a lot at that time, it took me a bit of

02:03.120 --> 02:08.600
time to be about three to four months, not because they're deep and profound or

02:08.600 --> 02:14.960
dense in any way. In my opinion, they're pretty superficial, not too deep

02:15.200 --> 02:21.680
thinking. However, well, the reason it took a long time is because I just had

02:21.680 --> 02:25.840
other commitments. I couldn't write that much. However, what I was trying to make

02:25.840 --> 02:34.400
was that in those few months itself, I've been reflecting a lot on kind of a

02:34.400 --> 02:39.800
revelation, let's say, that I had in the past two years or so. It wasn't a

02:39.800 --> 02:44.000
sudden thing. It wasn't one event. It was a gradual change I had in my thinking.

02:44.800 --> 02:51.360
Both existentially, theologically, and as a result of that, perhaps,

02:51.360 --> 02:56.800
philosophically. And these three axioms, so four, five, six, that I'm going to cover

02:56.800 --> 03:02.400
for today and then five and six in future episodes, they're really important for me.

03:03.360 --> 03:07.520
They are important in the sense that they're very existentially put into the

03:07.520 --> 03:12.320
current place I'm in life. And I'm trying to deeply read thinkers such as

03:12.480 --> 03:19.280
Slavoj Žižek, Hortelik, and Nietzsche of Coz, and recently even the theologian Peter

03:19.280 --> 03:24.960
Rollins. These thinkers have had an unbelievable impact on how I viewed

03:24.960 --> 03:29.360
everything, especially Christianity, given that I'm a Christian. And therefore,

03:29.920 --> 03:34.240
because in many ways my identity comes from that relationship I have with

03:34.240 --> 03:40.480
Christianity and Christ, when my Christian beliefs are subverted, I myself am subverted.

03:41.440 --> 03:46.240
So these these axioms are important for me, four, five, and six, and I hope to

03:47.280 --> 03:51.760
carry on this podcast in the spirit of these axioms as I've said many times before.

03:51.760 --> 03:58.320
Anyway, that's enough of a introduction or prelude. I shall get started. Today is

03:58.320 --> 04:04.720
guiding axiom number four. It's called on writing, or in this case on podcasting,

04:04.800 --> 04:11.200
without lies, machinations, and bullshit. And of course, since I didn't mention in that

04:11.760 --> 04:17.760
unnecessarily long introduction, the link to the original article or essay is down

04:17.760 --> 04:23.440
in the description along with the other guiding axioms too. It's infinitely easier to know of a

04:23.440 --> 04:32.160
lie than what is true. Existentially, a lie is not a mere untrue, but an utterance of non-being.

04:33.120 --> 04:39.040
I got this term from Paul Tillich, by the way. And to be aware of non-being is more than the

04:39.040 --> 04:46.400
conceptual theoretical understanding of a philosophical concept. Once it's felt spiritually,

04:46.400 --> 04:53.360
the anxiety it imbues can leave one perturbed and unhinged. Such as why Paul Tillich states,

04:54.000 --> 05:00.640
anxiety is the existential awareness of non-being, the courage to be, page 35.

05:01.760 --> 05:08.800
The anxiety Tillich writes of is not the medicalized kind a psychiatrist would prescribe a drug to

05:08.800 --> 05:16.640
or a new age self-help guru would try to solve with a mindfulness course. It's inescapably

05:16.640 --> 05:22.560
a part of our being. In fact, Tillich says that this anxiety is ontological. As he continues

05:22.560 --> 05:28.000
on the courage to be page 36, perhaps I should not keep reading out the page numbers because

05:28.000 --> 05:32.160
that's kind of annoying, isn't it? I'll just say the name of the book and obviously in the

05:32.160 --> 05:36.880
original article that I'll link below, you'll see all the sources and pages and whatnot.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.920
So getting back to this, existential in this sentence means that it is not the abstract

05:43.920 --> 05:50.800
knowledge of non-being which produces anxiety, but the awareness that non-being is a part of

05:50.880 --> 05:59.120
one's own being. Anxiety is finitude, experienced as one's own finitude. This is the natural

05:59.120 --> 06:05.760
anxiety of man as man and in some way of all living beings, it is the anxiety of non-being,

06:05.760 --> 06:13.040
the awareness of one's finitude as finitude. So in this play of words that Tillich is doing here,

06:13.040 --> 06:18.960
what I understood it to be as that what we talk of anxiety angst or the idea of finitude, it is

06:19.680 --> 06:25.760
it is ontic in nature. It is the starting point. It isn't, in that sense, perhaps he gets it from

06:25.760 --> 06:31.040
psychoanalysis where, you know, I think the Freudian notion is, I mean, no way an expert

06:31.040 --> 06:38.960
in psychoanalysis, but my very superficial reading is that being born into this world itself is

06:38.960 --> 06:45.200
traumatic. It's trauma. We're born with trauma and our embellishment into being is a traumatic event

06:45.920 --> 06:51.840
which is why, you know, it goes on to the rest of psychoanalysis, repression, whatnot, hysteria.

06:53.440 --> 06:59.200
Therefore, I see anxiety in the same way. I see it as not something to be killed,

07:00.400 --> 07:06.720
despite, due to our own peril in my opinion, we've overtly medicalized it, but that's a whole

07:06.720 --> 07:12.560
other topic and in fact, it's a podcast that I'm going to do soon. I'm currently writing the script

07:12.560 --> 07:20.080
because it's a sensitive topic for many people. I want to be punctilious and I would say more

07:20.080 --> 07:26.720
respectful as to how I do it. Getting back to the essay, despite being encompassing non-being

07:26.720 --> 07:33.520
and the impossibility of a jettisoning existential anxiety, lying exacerbates the looming threat

07:33.520 --> 07:40.480
of non-being and make one's constitutive ontic anxiety pathological. You're aware of that's

07:40.480 --> 07:46.240
actuality. That at one arbitrary point in life, everything culminates in a nothingness.

07:46.960 --> 07:52.960
Despite you not knowing what this nothing truly entails, you have intimations of its eminence

07:53.680 --> 08:01.520
and yet you can cope with death. But if you lie and deceive in your finite existence, not only does

08:01.520 --> 08:08.160
death verge upon you insufferably, but your life becomes so agonizingly hellish that you'd wish

08:08.160 --> 08:15.600
you were dead already. This means we identify a lie or truth best not by the cognizance of

08:15.600 --> 08:21.200
correspondence or objective facts, the way a theoretician or a scientist would do with a given

08:21.200 --> 08:28.480
problem, but primarily by being attentive to one's inner thoughts, emotions and psychic states when

08:28.480 --> 08:34.400
ushering or writing something. In that vein, metaphysically speaking, if the universe is made

08:34.880 --> 08:42.320
up of facts, the trueness or falseness of a fact necessitates a human being who are designed to use

08:42.320 --> 08:50.160
how to give into terminology to come to being. Case in point, Martin Luther, the father of the

08:50.160 --> 08:57.280
Protestant Reformation, was a little known priest in 1517. This was until he famously hammered his

08:57.280 --> 09:04.480
95 pieces onto the doors of Old Saints Church in the border town of Wittenberg, Saxony, modern-day

09:04.480 --> 09:11.280
Germany, subsequently stirring up a storm across a whole of Europe and eventually every corner of

09:11.280 --> 09:18.640
the world. His list began the ongoing dissension between the hegemony of the Roman Catholic Church

09:18.640 --> 09:25.360
and its opponents, colloquially known as the Protestants, and secularly precipitated leftism.

09:25.440 --> 09:30.320
This is true, I believe that Martin Luther was pretty much the first leftist. I'll start that

09:30.320 --> 09:36.880
sentence from the top, and secularly precipitated leftism, anti-statism and modernity as a whole.

09:37.680 --> 09:42.480
One could argue that many momentous historical revolutions and social movements,

09:43.520 --> 09:50.080
from the French Revolution to the civil rights movement, could be pointed to this ostensibly

09:50.080 --> 09:55.200
simple act by Luther, which he intended only to start an academic debate.

09:56.320 --> 10:04.320
At the time, the absolute theocratic authority of the Church led to Luther's excommunication

10:04.320 --> 10:11.600
by Pope Leo X, and he was called to the diet of worms, a formal deliberative assembly,

10:12.320 --> 10:18.960
and demanded to recant his heretical statements over risk being burnt at the stake. In his

10:18.960 --> 10:25.120
intransigency, notwithstanding the risk of dying a brutal death, he famously responded,

10:26.240 --> 10:31.680
my conscience is captive to the word of God, thus I cannot and will not recant,

10:32.720 --> 10:39.600
because acting against one's conscience is neither safe nor sound. Here I stand, I can do no other,

10:39.600 --> 10:45.760
God help me. Since we live in secular times and are detached from a pre-reform society,

10:45.760 --> 10:51.440
we can't understand the significance of Luther's actions. No reading of history will

10:51.440 --> 10:56.960
help us realize the radical change he set forth in humanity. However, we all have our own

10:56.960 --> 11:03.120
distinctive moments of here I stand, I can do no other. Luther believed to have found

11:03.120 --> 11:11.040
metaphysical truths about being, of course, perhaps I will not, perhaps if I rewrote this,

11:11.040 --> 11:17.040
I would probably have not put the word metaphysical in there, because after reading Heidegger,

11:17.040 --> 11:21.920
I'm beginning to question the whole project of metaphysics itself, so I don't know if

11:21.920 --> 11:29.120
Luther really was talking about metaphysical truths in that sense, so I would just leave it as

11:29.120 --> 11:34.960
Luther believed to have found truths about being. Okay, back to the essay. But all he had to stand

11:34.960 --> 11:42.080
by was his conscience, not an objective theory of any kind. His only way to discern truth from

11:42.080 --> 11:47.840
untruth was solely himself. If he recanted his statements, he would be telling the greatest

11:47.840 --> 11:54.960
of lies by defining his conscience. This he couldn't live with, which is why he can do no other.

11:54.960 --> 12:00.240
You and I have very little in common with Luther except for this phenomenon of being,

12:00.320 --> 12:04.080
creatures with an inescapable, idiosyncratic conscience.

12:04.880 --> 12:10.480
Leaving aside obstruous metaphysics and ontology, in our daily lives, in certain immediate

12:10.480 --> 12:17.600
particularities, we find truths above truth, but ourselves and conceivably the largest structural

12:17.600 --> 12:24.640
whole of reality itself. So we ought to pay attention to our lives with the utmost rigor.

12:25.200 --> 12:31.120
A lie is more than asserting an unfactual statement, because it's not withstanding

12:31.920 --> 12:38.240
machinations to obfuscate and masquerade lies as truth, even if we convince everyone to accept

12:38.240 --> 12:45.120
a lie as being true, when one lies, one knows. And to make matters worse, we are also self-deceiving.

12:45.680 --> 12:51.840
We must stop fooling ourselves into thinking that our emphatical will is the will to an

12:51.840 --> 12:58.640
unprejudiced truth, far from it. Kierkegaard, in his oblique characteristic Mao, was a

12:58.640 --> 13:04.080
philosopher who expounded best on finite man's susceptibility to self-deception.

13:04.880 --> 13:10.960
For instance, he was highly skeptical of Aristotelian virtue ethics and moral philosophy.

13:11.600 --> 13:17.920
A Kierkegaardian would find living man as solely a rational creature of moral reasoning to be

13:18.480 --> 13:22.560
unduly naive about the human capacity for radical evil.

13:22.560 --> 13:30.000
Despite at times its spuriousness and unreliability, the findings of psychoanalysis tell us that we

13:30.000 --> 13:36.720
cannot acontextually and abstractly follow an objective morality. Even when we think we are

13:36.720 --> 13:43.360
doing so, it could be self-deception. Comprehending this datum doesn't necessarily require reading

13:43.360 --> 13:48.960
the labyrinth of existentialism and moral philosophy, although we all ought to. Rather,

13:48.960 --> 13:56.400
being attentive to ourselves will suffice. Recall the last time you unequivocally knew

13:56.400 --> 14:01.600
you were doing something wrong, not new in the sense of knowing some historical fact or political

14:01.600 --> 14:09.280
theory that it would regurgitate to sound smart, but you felt a pang of profound guilt and visceral

14:09.280 --> 14:15.440
disgust towards yourself for a certain act. Amidst the moment, you hated who you were and couldn't

14:15.440 --> 14:22.640
relieve your conscience of this psychospiritual distress. At such times, most of us who would

14:22.640 --> 14:28.720
justify our subjective shortcomings that are supposed to be on par with our personal telos

14:29.360 --> 14:36.320
would conjure up any reason to tell ourselves we are not at fault, our intent was good or there

14:36.320 --> 14:43.680
was no real harm done, etc. And who could blame us? Life is hard and occasionally, perhaps always,

14:43.680 --> 14:51.840
out of pure pragmatism similar to cypher in the matrix, we choose to live in convenient lies

14:51.840 --> 15:00.960
as ignorance is bliss for most of us. In many ways, Nietzsche completed Kedricat's

15:00.960 --> 15:07.040
essentialism by hammering home the point that even our conscious decisions and social structures

15:07.040 --> 15:13.920
we're put in, for example, the revealed scientific institutions aren't oriented towards uppercase

15:13.920 --> 15:24.160
T truth. Nietzsche writes, even scientific inquiry itself, our science indeed, what does

15:24.160 --> 15:30.720
all scientific inquiry in general mean, considered as a symptom of life? What is the point of all

15:30.720 --> 15:37.200
that science and even more serious, where did it come from? What about that? Is scientific scholarship

15:37.200 --> 15:45.040
perhaps only a fear and an excuse in the face of pessimism? A delicate self-defense against

15:45.040 --> 15:51.360
the truth? And speaking morally, sometimes like cowardice and falsehood, speaking un morally,

15:51.360 --> 15:57.440
a clever trick. Oh Socrates, Socrates, was that perhaps your secret or your secretive

15:57.440 --> 16:06.160
ironness? Was that perhaps your irony? Gosh, I can never get over and not ever fall in love with

16:06.160 --> 16:11.120
Nietzsche's prose. It's just bizarre. I can't believe he writes like that. So what does it mean

16:11.120 --> 16:17.520
to be an authentic and truthful writer in this utter confusion of existence? It's someone who

16:17.520 --> 16:24.080
doesn't write bullshit. Unlike a liar who might at least have the pretense of being concerned for

16:24.080 --> 16:31.200
the truth, Harry G. Frankfurt expounds that bullshit is speech or writing by a bullshit artist

16:31.200 --> 16:38.880
without any regard for truth at all. Instead, he is predominantly aiming to be solely persuasive

16:40.240 --> 16:45.040
and change a listener or reader without convincing someone that something is true.

16:45.760 --> 16:52.640
It's even done unconsciously as Frankfurt elucidates in his paper. Our natures are indeed

16:52.640 --> 16:59.680
elusively insubstantial, notoriously less stable and less inherent than the natures of other things.

17:00.720 --> 17:08.240
And in so far as this is the case, sincerity itself is bullshit. Ergo, we ought to never confuse

17:08.240 --> 17:15.680
our sensible authenticity in speaking or writing as being truthful. Sincerity itself could be a tool

17:15.680 --> 17:22.800
used for deception. One can never truly know if one is being truthful. Much like love,

17:22.800 --> 17:28.960
truth is an article of faith. One falls into it and thereafter decides to pursue it. Pause,

17:28.960 --> 17:35.120
just a point here. When I mean one falls into it, I certainly don't mean it's a complete arbitrary

17:35.120 --> 17:42.240
chaotic random event. You know, finding truth or falling in love. For both to happen, to find

17:42.240 --> 17:47.840
truth and even to fall in love, I believe we have to, as a subject, orient ourselves towards

17:47.840 --> 17:53.280
the fall, so to speak. And I'm going to write about this in the future. Once we fall, we have to

17:53.280 --> 18:00.560
decide to be fallen. Therefore, it's not a mere chaotic irrational event completely out of our

18:00.560 --> 18:06.720
control. We not very much, or ultimately perhaps, but in many ways we do have control at least

18:06.720 --> 18:13.280
as to how we orient ourselves and as to how we are ready to find love or find truth.

18:14.080 --> 18:19.200
Alright, back to the essay. Essentially speaking, which is the only way one ought to speak about

18:19.200 --> 18:26.080
such matters, this is why truth is an orientation, as I had said before. The intent of an individual

18:26.080 --> 18:32.640
and a state of being one chooses to embody rather than a destination, set of facts or propositions.

18:33.360 --> 18:39.360
In that sense, one could make an unfactual statement due to their ignorance, but still not

18:39.360 --> 18:45.920
be a liar, or bush it up, as he is still aiming at being a seeker of truth, notwithstanding

18:45.920 --> 18:52.720
his proclivity to be fallible due to the sheer fact of being human. Of course, an outside observer

18:52.720 --> 18:58.640
cannot empirically verify this, it's entirely left to one's conscience, so perhaps one should

18:58.720 --> 19:05.520
be petrified of lying and striving to be an arbiter of truth. Sojournetsen was right when he wrote,

19:05.520 --> 19:11.680
the simple step of a courageous individual is not to take part in the lie. Subjectivity is truth.

19:12.880 --> 19:16.880
And this leads to one of the most contentious statements of this essay.

19:17.840 --> 19:29.360
While I'll strive for objectivity, pause. I had to pause there and think, because I don't even

19:29.360 --> 19:35.200
know what I mean as strive for objectivity, what that means. Perhaps the more apt term is

19:36.080 --> 19:43.440
while I'll strive for a trans subjectivity, a common subjectivity, if that makes any sense at all,

19:43.440 --> 19:49.440
because I'm commonly believed that we have no way of knowing what's objectively true.

19:51.600 --> 19:57.520
It's something that just doesn't comprehend. It's not something that I can resonate with,

19:58.160 --> 20:03.680
objective truth in that sense. All right, back to the essay. I don't want to over complicate this,

20:03.680 --> 20:06.480
just want to, at least in some sense, stick to the essay.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.720
I'll start again on that. I kind of screwed up that sentence.

20:13.440 --> 20:19.680
So subjectivity is truth. And this leads to one of the most contentious statements of this essay.

20:20.640 --> 20:25.440
While I'll strive for objectivity, I need to realize that for the type of being we are,

20:25.440 --> 20:31.120
that is human and not God, subjectivity is true. In his trenchant critique of German

20:31.120 --> 20:38.240
idealism and ardent emphasis on existence to be with an inwardness over abstract theorizing,

20:38.880 --> 20:43.920
yet again, it was Kerkregat who expounds, and even introduced to the western mind, perhaps,

20:44.560 --> 20:48.880
the notion of truth that matters above all other truths is the subjective one.

20:48.880 --> 20:53.840
Sarat, of course, appropriated this project for a secular world with this atheistic

20:53.840 --> 21:00.400
existentialism of radical freedom. I'm more a Kerkregadian than a Saratrian, as I'm a religious

21:00.400 --> 21:06.800
Nietzschean. That is to say, God does not exist objectively, but purely subjectively. And what

21:06.800 --> 21:12.320
matters is not the afterlife, but the present one. Therefore, I'll write through the lens of

21:12.320 --> 21:20.960
subjective truth and be primarily concerned with subjectivity. Kerkregat writes in concluding

21:20.960 --> 21:28.480
unscientific postscript, Christianity protests against every form of objectivity. He desires

21:28.480 --> 21:34.880
that the subject should be infinitely concerned about himself. It is with subjectivity that

21:34.960 --> 21:41.760
Christianity is concerned, and it is only in subjectively that its truth exists. If it exists

21:41.760 --> 21:50.720
at all, objectively, Christianity has absolutely no existence. If the truth happens to be only in

21:50.720 --> 21:57.760
a single subject, it exists in him alone. And there is greater Christian joy in heaven over

21:57.760 --> 22:04.080
this one individual than over universal history or the system. I like that last bit because he's

22:05.200 --> 22:14.640
sort of mocking Hegel there. For him, God is a subject and therefore requires a subject-to-subject

22:14.640 --> 22:22.080
relation. Of course, I'm not sure if that's true. I know, I thought that was the case when I wrote it,

22:22.080 --> 22:27.360
but after reading Paul Tillich, who was also influenced by Kerkregat, I'm not sure if Kerkregat

22:27.360 --> 22:35.280
believed God was just a subject or if God transcends the object-subject binary. Tillich thinks

22:35.840 --> 22:40.480
that certainly to be the case, he believes God does transcend that binary, and so do I.

22:41.520 --> 22:46.160
So I need to take that sentence with a grain of salt because I'm not sure if that's true.

22:48.800 --> 22:55.360
Back to the essay. This is why old religious scripture discloses truth, not systems to us

22:55.360 --> 23:02.160
subjects. Similarly, this idea could be secularly reappropriated for our ordinary life,

23:02.800 --> 23:09.360
which entails being subjective and dealing with other subjects, and unsurprisingly when people

23:09.360 --> 23:15.360
are treated any differently, it infuriates them. For instance, a feminist has right to say the

23:15.360 --> 23:22.240
objectification of women is wrong, but ironically, this so-called objectification is a subjective

23:22.320 --> 23:27.840
passion of, let's say, male chauvinism. So nonetheless, it's a subject-to-subject relation.

23:28.720 --> 23:34.560
We cannot escape subjectivity. Perhaps if I wrote purely about the objective natural sciences,

23:35.280 --> 23:41.200
this statement might not wholly apply. That too is questionable since it's us who do the science.

23:41.840 --> 23:47.680
In any case, since the unhappy man is about the individual, there's no decoupling or universalizing

23:47.680 --> 23:53.440
the human experience from it. And subjectivity is what it ultimately means to be a human being,

23:53.440 --> 23:59.760
banan. Such as why Sartre rightly argued against Freud's empirical psychoanalysis

23:59.760 --> 24:05.680
that attempts to schematize a human mind via a collection of observations. For Sartre,

24:05.680 --> 24:11.600
the psyche is irreducible. Ergo, I am deeply skeptical of psychometrics that attempts to

24:11.600 --> 24:17.200
prescribe identities to individuals through its lust for categorizing, for example,

24:17.200 --> 24:23.280
gender differences. A cognitive scientist could study the qualia, qualities of the world as perceived

24:23.280 --> 24:29.920
and experienced by us, of a human subject experiencing the color red, a footy game,

24:29.920 --> 24:38.240
or Tchaikovsky's piano concerto number one, Opus 23, and analyze the subject's brain waves,

24:38.240 --> 24:45.120
heart rate, facial expressions, etc. And convince himself he has an empirical objective,

24:45.120 --> 24:50.960
even ontological understanding of a person. But it'll be a great act of self-deception

24:50.960 --> 24:57.520
and scientific malady to presume he precisely knows what an individual, or the subject he's

24:57.520 --> 25:03.440
studying in particular, is experiencing in a way that his findings could replace the actual human

25:03.440 --> 25:10.560
being. A psychometrition could categorize human beings into the taxonomy of personality traits

25:10.560 --> 25:18.480
such as the big five at infinitum, but never settle on what the actual existence of an individual

25:18.480 --> 25:25.600
entails, which is why those traits are an ever-growing enumeration. And of course, no Shakespearean

25:25.600 --> 25:31.920
sonnet, no matter how breathtakingly poetic, will truly capture what it means for you and me

25:32.480 --> 25:40.080
to fall in love. In essence, every human being is the eternal distinction in reality, because

25:40.080 --> 25:48.080
the individual who has become is to be and is becoming will have a life no one or thing ever will.

25:49.040 --> 25:55.120
In that sense, the only verity we can be sure of is that we are all eternally lonely in this world.

25:55.600 --> 26:03.040
The synagogue for writing on human experience is the epistemic humility to know that I will invariably

26:03.040 --> 26:10.400
fail at tapping into a person's subjective truth, and will only be able to delineate my subjectivity,

26:10.400 --> 26:17.440
at least that which is effable. Therefore, I write at the risk of being utterly nonsensical,

26:17.440 --> 26:23.040
and to be an authentic writer is to accept that writing will never fully encompass

26:23.040 --> 26:31.200
existence, specifically that of a soul reader. In that vein, to write well is to know the limits of writing.
