0	3480	And I know you don't like compliments, but I'm an evil guy, so I'm going to compliment
3480	4480	you.
4480	11600	My favorite theories of love ever since I started reading philosophy was Alain Bajos,
11600	13640	and then it was Todd McGavin's.
13640	19640	And now I'd unequivocally say it's yours, the way you've articulated it in your book.
19640	25080	It is, I don't even know where else to go from there, as in the way you laid down the
25080	29240	entirety of love around like loss and this dying and negativity.
29240	36000	But just again, I know you've spoken about this in a couple of places, but yeah, through
36000	43400	your framework of let's say, or worldview of depressive realism and negative philosophy,
43400	45400	what is love?
45400	47600	Thank you.
47600	55120	So love is comprehended in everything else from the negative perspective as the based
55120	63440	on negativity, trauma, love, lack and all of those who love as dramatic and at the same
63440	73120	time impossible in its nature, love as suicidal, self-destructive and the very connection between
73120	74800	others.
74800	85160	What structures the bond, the romantic bond, love relationship is the rupture between us,
85160	90800	which destroys us at the same time and creates the connection.
90800	96720	So when you reach the core of love, it hurts and you die.
96720	99480	And maybe the other person also dies.
99480	106000	And the healthy relationship was considered the healthy relationship in psychotherapeutic
106000	107000	society.
107000	114960	I think it's just concealing enough, this painful, impossible core of love for us not to notice
114960	115960	it.
115960	123600	But I'm sure people know that healthy relationship, they're very boring and they don't feel like
123600	124600	love.
124600	125600	That's the problem.
125720	127960	Like you can have it.
127960	133360	It's not a problem to have a healthy relationship, it's just super boring and it's not love.
133360	137840	What we call love, unfortunately, is just a very cruel joke.
137840	144560	It's when you're dying into it, when you encounter the impossibility of it, it's the only way
144560	155440	to feel it, which is super horrifying, especially for the Valentine's Day and the revelation.
155720	157800	The isolation also doesn't help.
157800	167720	The other is the one who hurts and we only feel them in a way, I think, that they hurt
167720	168720	us.
168720	171640	The other is the one that hurts in us.
171640	178680	The isolation would be also not the protection from it, maybe protection, but also a certain
178680	183040	type of social bond that also hurts the other hurt.
183040	192000	You can constitute relation with them by isolating yourself from them and being isolated, it's
192000	198280	still the condition that hurts because you're isolated precisely.
198280	203560	You also feel the bond with the other through pain.
203720	213720	The attachment theory, which gives the hope of healthy relationship, of healthy attachment type.
213720	219480	I think that in each principle, it's like we hope that the healthy one doesn't hurt.
219480	222160	It's the best one.
222160	231480	And I think that it hurts, but when you just reduce it, conceal it enough.
231560	242200	The pain, when it starts to be boring, then it's just possible to bearable, but it just
242200	245400	doesn't feel that there is a connection anymore.
245400	250760	It's presently bearable because it's not the attachment that might be concealed.
252440	254120	Yeah.
254120	256040	So Peter Rollins, I didn't mention him too.
256040	259920	He too really influenced my thinking on the idea of love around loss.
260240	265600	So for him, he articulates this quite well in the previous conversations we had.
265600	268080	He said that, which I love this.
268080	273520	He says communion is building a community around a shared loss.
275200	278000	And well, I'll just put it this way.
278000	286960	What are your just intimations on that idea that loving is kind of feeling this loss,
286960	289840	ontological loss within us?
290800	294640	And yeah, does that sit along with your philosophy too?
295280	297120	Or would you radicalize that even further?
298960	306720	Yeah, Peter Rollins distinguishes, which is great between community and communion.
306720	311840	Community would be more a conventional way of people getting together because they share
311840	317280	something, like they share enemies or a certain goal, a certain identification,
317280	318720	they have something in common.
319920	323600	He doesn't like it and he suggests what he creates is communion.
324800	332240	When people share nothing, loss, luck, and this would be authentic relation.
333040	334320	I would radicalize it.
335280	346960	I think in a way that presents itself as this is a proper way of how things supposed to be.
347920	357680	And I would think of trying to think of a therapy as the communion instead of treatment,
357680	365040	instead of fixing someone, instead of hierarchy of bringing to a certain healthier
365040	369120	conditional improvement, like the communion, sharing nothing.
371040	377360	There still has hope to it that this is a happy thing, the way it's supposed to be,
377360	380800	if one thinks about love in these terms.
380800	387040	It gives the hope that there is a way, what we have to do and that it brings harmony
387680	392240	something, that there is a luck and we need to connect through this luck.
392240	397520	And then it's going to be authentic, equalized with a harmonious, happy relationship.
398960	403200	To be honest, I don't think there is happy.
405040	408000	Like this is harmonious relationship.
408000	414560	I think it's also one of the ways, one of the illusions, how we would like, we would like
414560	419920	to hope that it exists, but it doesn't.
421200	427200	And still talking about how it should be done, it's still trying.
427200	431280	We are connecting, I think, ontologically through it.
431280	433280	There is no other ways to connect.
433280	434960	It's not what we have to do.
434960	438640	It's like maybe comforting illusion in a way.
438640	444000	It's like training a cat who are impossible to train to sit, for example.
444560	449040	And telling the cat to sit when the cat is already sitting.
449040	451360	You know, it sits, it starts to sit.
451360	455360	You tell it to sit and you have illusion that the cat obeys,
455360	459440	where it's just your operation upon the cat to comfort you.
459440	462480	This is a similar thing with what we have to do with love.
465040	469280	It's already there in a horrifying way.
469280	475200	There is nothing you can do or you have to do to make it better or to do it properly.
477040	478000	It's not the problem.
478000	481360	It's just different comprehension, maybe.
482560	488880	Either you discuss love and trying to figure out the correct form of love that would bring
488880	494560	happiness, won't hurt anyone or hurt less, or you just horrified of love.
494560	496240	That's what I'm rather young.
496560	507520	It's presence in inevitable nature and a horror of it without trying to anymore escaping into
507520	512160	how to fix something or what's the correct form of attachment.
512720	515520	Just horrified without escaping from it.
516320	524240	And I'm not saying that this is how the proper way to think about it is the certain state of
524240	525120	my existence.
526320	528240	Yeah, I do like what Jojak says.
528240	532080	I think in one of his, it's probably in a documentary, in one of the Pervod's guides
532080	536960	documentaries, he says that love is a disaster, it's a catastrophe.
538000	540240	But then there's also when I'm not in love, I'm sad.
540720	545200	So it's like, whereas you're saying both when you're in love and not in love,
545200	547280	you're going to be sad, you're going to be irregardless.
547280	550080	Just face the catastrophe, so to speak.
550400	558400	Yeah, so I think that the, and Kierkegaard, one who knew that you both get married and
558400	559920	don't get married, you regret.
561920	563920	We have the hope for being saved.
563920	570560	Simone de Boire talks about women who treat men as the form of salvation,
570560	571600	the most immediate one.
571600	575680	When you're alone, you're expecting for men to save you.
576080	583600	And one, this disillusion once you're in a relationship, because it's, you're in a
583600	585200	relationship, but no one is saving you.
586240	593120	Encounter the horror of being in a relationship, being disillusioned in this salvation.
593120	593840	It's not heaven.
594560	595120	Didn't work.
595680	602480	So you, once you are not in a relationship, you expect to get rid of the horror of being
602480	604800	alone while you're in a relationship.
604800	610720	And in relationship, the other way around, you expect to be saved of the horror of
610720	615760	relationship, ending relationship, or proceeding to find someone else better,
615760	616880	something like it.
616880	618800	But it's the horror every time.
618800	624480	It just, for a while, you remember the previous horror, the previous type of horror.
624480	626080	And you think that this is improvement.
626080	628320	It helps you to hold on for a while.
628320	629680	Then you forget about it.
629680	633600	It's like encounter a horror of this situation, of relationship, for example.
633600	639280	And then you're hoping for opposite salvation in the end of relationship.
639280	640480	It just never comes.
640480	646240	So it's both horror of, when we are in relationship, we get dressed from the
646240	651280	previous type of horror and then the dialectics forever.
651840	655920	Or you just get adapted to a certain type of horror.
656800	661040	Being alone or being with someone, the tolerable horror.
661040	662240	And you settle.
