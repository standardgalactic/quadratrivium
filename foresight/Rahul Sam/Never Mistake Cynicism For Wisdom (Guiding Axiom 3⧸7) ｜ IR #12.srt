00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the NRLN podcast.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,520
I shall continue what I've been doing in the previous episodes where I read out these guiding

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,440
axioms that I laid down for my newsletter, The Unhappy Man, and in case you didn't watch the

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:24,240
previous episodes to repeat the same old introduction, sort of ad nauseam, I laid down

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,120
seven axioms for my writing for the newsletter and in the middle of it I realized, oh wow,

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,360
what I'm writing here, it's not just for the newsletter, in fact it's sort of a framework for

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,360
all of my creative work and this podcast certainly is a part of what I consider to be my creative

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,960
work so it just makes sense to read out these axioms so that, you know, since the podcast just

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:56,000
started and if you're a new variable listener, whatever you may be, you'll see where I'm coming at

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,160
when I'm trying to produce content for the podcast, not just my monologues or my pieces,

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,240
even the interviews I hope to do through the axioms that I've been laying down.

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,400
And today's axiom is axiom number three. If you did miss the other two, please go and watch them.

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,080
It's part of the playlist, it's all on the YouTube channel on Spotify.

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:29,120
But without further ado, let's get started. The guiding axiom number three for the unhappy man,

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,920
for the inner realm podcast, for all of my creative work is, and this is very, very important,

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,640
I wrote this with a lot of passion, I would say. It's something that's very, very close to my heart.

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320
Never mistake cynicism for wisdom.

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,000
In Dostoevsky's Kraman punishment, Raskolnikov has a point when he says,

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,600
pain and suffering are always inevitable.

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,720
For a large intelligence and a deep heart, the really great men must, I think, have a great sadness

21
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:14,320
on earth. Perhaps it's true that men of higher intellectual acuity are more aware of the world's

22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,840
tragedy and folly. So their contempt for the deluded masses who are lost in superficial vanity

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,080
and worldly self-indulgence probably has some warrant. But I wonder if those ancient critiques

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,280
with their eruditeness and polemical virtuosity tend to fall in love with their own ingenious.

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,120
In truth, the highbrows rarely believe about themselves what Socrates declared of himself.

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:50,240
I neither know nor think I know. Most casual, critical philosophizing is merely one's

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,800
cynicism being projected onto the world masquerading as wisdom.

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,120
The only thing worse than a cynic is an accompanying sharp intellect to tantalize

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,920
a cynicism. For instance, if we take happiness, something elusive for us humans, such a person

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,200
refuses to believe that someone could be genuinely happy in this world, and is dismissive or even

31
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,960
hates anyone trying to do so. Let's see a man who's sincerely endeavoring to make something of

32
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,760
himself as merely a show, one puts on to please the cultural overlords,

33
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,720
pusillanimously and slavishly living by an emasculating moral duty. For the cynic,

34
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,600
the ordinary person, playing his part as a steadfast citizen, fulfilling his responsibilities

35
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,040
towards his family, paying his dues to the divine, without overtly theologizing God,

36
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,640
and maybe even volunteering at a homeless shelter once in a while is all but puppetry.

37
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,680
The cynic sneers at all of this effort and says it's all futile and only for the credulous.

38
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,320
They are in utter disbelief of sincerity and anyone striving towards the good. In their

39
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,800
enlightenment state, they think of themselves as being beyond the trivialities of ordinary life and

40
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:19,200
basic morality, despite being willing to even suffer for their cynical ideologies.

41
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,840
But the irony is that a cynic is critical of everything and anything but their hubristic

42
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,080
cynicism. The cynical attitude of the heart always comes first and the rationalization second.

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,280
Whenever I encounter a cynic, which sometimes is someone I meet within my own soul, I'm reminded

44
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,680
of what G.K. Chesterton wrote about the new rebel in orthodoxy. But the new rebel is a skeptic

45
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,480
and will not entirely trust anything. He has no loyalty, therefore he can never be really a

46
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:01,360
revolutionist. And the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants

47
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,200
to denounce anything. For all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind,

48
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,520
and the modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces, but the doctrine by

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,640
which he denounces it. Thus he writes one book complaining that imperial oppression insults

50
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,040
the purity of women and then he writes another book about the sex problem in which he insults it

51
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:34,160
himself. He curses a sultan because christian girls lose their virginity and then curses

52
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,120
Mrs. Grandi because they kept it. As a politician, he would cry out that war is a waste of life and

53
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,320
then as a philosopher that all of life is a waste of time. A russian pessimist will denounce a policeman

54
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,120
for killing a peasant and then proved by the highest philosophical principles that the peasant

55
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:01,760
ought to have killed himself. A man denounces marriage as a lie and then denounces aristocratic

56
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,600
profligates for treating it as a lie. He calls a flag a bubble and then blames the oppressors of

57
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,000
poland or island because they take away that bubble. The man of this school goes first to a

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,160
political meeting where he complains that savages are treated as if they were beasts, then he takes

59
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,400
his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting where he proves that they practically

60
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:34,480
are beasts. In short, the modern revolutionist being an infinite skeptic is always engaged

61
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:43,360
in undermining his own minds. In his book on politics, he attacks men for trampling on morality.

62
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,440
In his book on ethics, he attacks morality for trampling on men. Therefore, the modern man

63
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,840
in revolt has practically become useless for all purposes of revolt. A rebelling against

64
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,240
everything, he has lost a right to rebel against anything. So before I do read out my commentary

65
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,480
on that paragraph, the good thing about doing a podcast is I can sort of impromptuly add notes

66
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,560
and ancillary points to reading the essay. So think of this as more of a footnote. A lot of people

67
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,240
think of Chesterton as being a typical orthodox conservative kind of thinker and theologian,

68
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,240
but I wouldn't necessarily simplify him to that level. I think he's a much deeper,

69
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,760
profound thinker than merely someone defending the orthodoxy. So in that spirit,

70
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:42,480
I read him and in that spirit, I wrote this little bit as a commentary on what I just read.

71
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,720
To explicate his sentiments, Chesterton writes not of his averseness or disdain of the

72
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:59,040
revolutionary, but of the rebel who's a cynic, where his ideological affiliations merely a projection

73
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:07,520
of an essential spiritual attitude. And the problem with the cynicism is that it becomes a lazy way

74
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,840
to opt out of life. Echoing a more contemporary religious thinker, Jordan Pearson's sentiments,

75
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,560
we're met with an ultimate outlook on life. Either everything wonders matters, which comes

76
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,640
with the concomitant and crushing burden of responsibility. The striving man chooses his

77
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:33,840
path and recognizes that his striving, no matter how arduous and demanding, is meaningful and necessary.

78
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,920
Or the other is nothing matters, therefore one refuses to partake in life.

79
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,440
This man is super-seriously contemptuous of the striving man and his so-called higher virtues,

80
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,400
which is too simple and naive. It's only a matter of time when such a person's cynicism

81
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,760
becomes resentment and they've created hell for themselves. He'd say better to be a king in hell

82
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,120
than a slave in heaven. Funnily enough, I've begun to notice the latter type in the more cerebral

83
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,840
intellectual types. But that's a whole other conversation. In any case, existential apathy

84
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,160
and resignation cannot be a mere negation because being, which we all in escapably are,

85
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,320
requires the void to be filled with something meaningful.

86
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:32,640
Free will itself is mostly a curse, as one does not look into the niche in abyss.

87
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,600
But the infinite boundlessness of one's possibilities, which Kierkegaard called

88
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,920
the dizziness of freedom that everyone confronts in life when we are met with freedom's

89
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,640
actuality as the possibility of possibility. This is why the philosophers try to convince

90
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,240
themselves that men are not free. Most of us are petrified of truly being free.

91
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,560
I do believe that. Having said that, I'm not as optimistic as Peterson or any other run-of-the-mill

92
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,960
conservative. Unequivocally adopting responsibility, much like the striving man Ipsofacto, cannot be

93
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:23,920
the antidote to rescue one from the gazing abyss or the dizziness imbued by the endless possibility

94
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:33,040
of possibility. I could see how most of us modern humans could be a Joseph K. or a Gregor Samsa

95
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:40,000
stuck in a Kafkaesque nightmare, lost in triviality and vanity, doing meaningless alienating work,

96
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:48,160
knowing very well our life entails nothingness, but refusing to unshackle ourselves from the

97
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:57,360
ideological chains as freedom hurts. Kafka himself wrote, I'm in chains, don't touch my chains.

98
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,560
Yeah, that paragraph clearly is my Marxist side. I think the conservatives are way too optimistic

99
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,640
and to some sense even naive about this question of meaning. In any case, the final paragraph.

100
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:20,320
Ergo, in typical absurdist fashion, I go even a step further from my previous claim of humans being

101
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,720
lousy at being happy to conclude that we're equally or even lousier at finding meaning,

102
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,360
despite being the only beings in the universe that yearns for it desperately. The predominant

103
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,640
ideologies and modes of being prescribed to us by the wisest of men, stoicism, revolt or rebellion,

104
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,360
adopting responsibility, piety, cosmic resignation, sartrean, radical freedom, the postmodern notion

105
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:57,040
of existence, perceived essence, etc. are inadequate for the human heart. While there are

106
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,600
pronounced ways to be unhappy, miserable, loveless and meaningless in life, there's no ideal

107
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:12,880
predestined way to be happy, content and living meaningfully. In that case, I have no choice but

108
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,600
to be wholeheartedly happy for the happiness of another, even though it may seem ludicrous to me.

109
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,960
I ought to never assume someone's happiness is a sign of inauthenticity or God forbid naivety.

110
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:35,920
And indeed, this means never to mistake my cynicism for wisdom. And in this podcast,

111
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:43,680
I shall always strive to never, ever make that mistake. Thanks for watching. Cheers.
