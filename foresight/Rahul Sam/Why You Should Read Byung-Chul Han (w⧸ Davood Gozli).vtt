00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
In this episode, I would emphasize for people who are new to Han, my kind of invitation would be

00:12.960 --> 00:22.160
he is really great at connecting our very personal experiences, like the experience of being tired,

00:22.160 --> 00:30.560
the experience of not having enough mental energy to do all the tasks that you're supposed to do.

00:31.600 --> 00:36.560
Our experiences of loneliness, being tired and alone at the end of the day.

00:37.440 --> 00:46.560
And all these experiences, he pays attention to them and he connects them to broader patterns,

00:46.640 --> 00:55.440
broader trends in culture, in society, in technology. And that is really valuable, I think.

00:55.440 --> 01:03.200
He keeps, he doesn't keep the discussion of private experiences at that level, at that scope,

01:03.200 --> 01:07.280
at that original scope of interest. Yes, of course, we're interested in it, but

01:07.920 --> 01:12.800
he helps us make sense of it by putting it in a larger context and different contexts.

01:12.800 --> 01:19.920
And with the help of different thinkers, he introduces us to a host of other valuable

01:19.920 --> 01:30.720
thinkers like Foucault, Plato, Nietzsche, Arendt, Hannah Arendt, and he's very good at connecting

01:31.280 --> 01:37.360
the moments in our thought, in a discussion with the right moments, the right person.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.360
Hey, everyone. Welcome to my conversation with the cognitive psychologist,

01:41.360 --> 01:48.000
writer, fellow bibliophile, and now someone who I can hopefully call my friend, Dr. Davood Gosley.

01:48.720 --> 01:53.760
This certainly was a conversation that I expected to be amiable and good-natured,

01:53.760 --> 01:58.080
and it certainly was. My expectations were met. I've been following Davood's book reviews for

01:58.080 --> 02:02.960
about a year now, and I've thoroughly enjoyed them. And a couple of months ago, I noticed that he's

02:02.960 --> 02:07.600
done a lot of reviews on Byung-Shul Han's work, and they were fantastic reviews. They weren't

02:07.600 --> 02:13.280
mere cheap summaries where you'd quickly get across what the book says, but rather he critiqued them,

02:13.280 --> 02:18.880
he discussed the ideas that spoke to him more deeply, and they always came from his point of

02:18.880 --> 02:24.320
view, despite him reviewing the work of another thinker. And this got me thinking, perhaps I've

02:24.320 --> 02:30.800
always wanted to do an episode or a podcast dedicated to exploring Byung-Shul Han, and I

02:30.880 --> 02:37.760
thought Davood would be the perfect candidate to converse with. And I hope I was a good interlocutor

02:37.760 --> 02:44.240
and brought up the best of both Davood and Byung-Shul Han's work, but you'd be the judge of that.

02:44.240 --> 02:50.240
We spoke about a variety of topics. We discussed Davood's experience in academia, both it's

02:51.280 --> 02:57.040
good and bad, perhaps mostly bad, unfortunately, and also some of the ideas of living in

02:57.040 --> 03:02.480
neoliberal society and the logic of neoliberalism, and then explode some of the concepts that

03:02.480 --> 03:08.160
Byung-Shul Han has introduced to the contemporary critical theory dialogue, let's say. But also,

03:08.160 --> 03:13.040
in many ways, I was joking around during the episode, but I kind of meant in some sense too that,

03:13.760 --> 03:19.600
sorry, I've got a bit of a cold, that I do want this episode to be some kind of propagandistic

03:20.240 --> 03:26.080
conversation for you to go read the work of Byung-Shul Han, because I do think it can bring

03:26.080 --> 03:31.280
great value to your life, especially in the society and culture we live in, where

03:32.000 --> 03:37.120
a lot of the problems are made private and personalized when some of them really aren't

03:37.120 --> 03:42.000
private in the first place. They are social problems. But we discussed this in detail during

03:42.000 --> 03:46.400
the conversation, so I won't get into it right now. That being said, as I tend to do, a bit of a

03:46.400 --> 03:53.040
formal introduction to Davood. Dr. Davood Gosley is a cognitive psychologist. He received his PhD

03:53.040 --> 03:58.800
from the University of Toronto. He has held research and teaching positions at the University

03:58.800 --> 04:05.680
of Vienna, Leiden University, and the University of Macau. He is the author of many scholarly articles

04:05.680 --> 04:11.760
and a book titled Experimental Psychology and Human Agency. Dr. Gosley has a YouTube channel where

04:11.760 --> 04:18.640
he posts book reviews panning a vast array of writers and genres from Heruki Murakami to Byung-Shul

04:18.640 --> 04:25.200
Han and fiction to critical theory. He also runs a book club organized through his Patreon page.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.360
Having said that, here's my conversation with Dr. Davood Gosley, where we discuss the work of Byung-Shul

04:31.360 --> 04:36.880
Han. It's really interesting. I think I subscribe more to kind of the Todd McGovern, in fact,

04:36.880 --> 04:42.000
wrote a book about this, which I'll be talking to him soon. It's called Embracing Alienation.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.560
And I find that I don't try to, like, at least personally, I don't let myself kind of be too

04:50.560 --> 04:55.920
attached, overly attached to the kind of the socio-symbolic order of a certain culture. Like,

04:55.920 --> 05:02.480
I don't really, despite being a dual citizen, just like in terms of formally, I don't really

05:02.480 --> 05:06.880
think of myself as like a Sri Lankan Australian, or, you know, it's not something I attach myself

05:06.960 --> 05:14.160
to too much. Certainly, my home is Australia, but yeah, don't get me wrong. I'm not like a hippie

05:14.160 --> 05:18.160
that's like, oh, I'm a globalist. No, we need a home. I think, you know, we need a place that we

05:18.160 --> 05:28.640
call home. But I guess to be succinct, I try to not think too much about, like, which culture am

05:28.640 --> 05:35.440
I a part of? What's like my true, unique, you know, authentic culture? Because, as I think

05:35.760 --> 05:40.880
Jacques puts as well, cultures themselves aren't authentic in themselves. They themselves have

05:40.880 --> 05:48.000
this like, sure, ontological incompleteness, let's say. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes people go after

05:48.000 --> 05:55.200
having a culture, they turn that into a project, expecting it to provide them with something,

05:55.200 --> 06:01.760
something very stable and final, and help them get rid of that sense of alienation once and for

06:02.320 --> 06:07.200
all. Yeah, yeah. If we turn that into that kind of turn it into that kind of project,

06:07.200 --> 06:13.200
I think that would be disappointing, ultimately. Yeah, because unfortunately, I don't know what

06:13.200 --> 06:18.160
your thoughts on this, David, especially given you're much closer to the US than I am. I mean,

06:18.160 --> 06:23.200
there's a there's a rise in nationalism, right? And I think a lot of them are looking for this,

06:23.840 --> 06:30.720
the big other, the stable big other, and they want to fully attach themselves with it. And then

06:30.720 --> 06:38.160
it's from there, they have this like, sense of stability, which, at least since modernity,

06:38.160 --> 06:44.880
subjects have never had in the world. We like, Todd McGovern says that kind of the one sign of

06:44.880 --> 06:49.680
modernity is that all subjects are alienated. We don't have a home in some sense. None of us

06:49.680 --> 06:57.360
are rooted in a home. But yeah, I think I mean, Todd McGovern, I mean, I like him a lot, but what

06:57.360 --> 07:03.840
does he know about being really alienated, living in a living in a place that nobody speaks his

07:03.840 --> 07:09.440
language? I mean, sure, theoretically, I follow him to I follow him to but there's there are different

07:09.440 --> 07:17.040
degrees of being out of place. Some of them are more visceral. I agree. Some of them are more like

07:17.040 --> 07:24.400
you have to really think your way to them. But to be in a place and everybody's pointing at you

07:24.400 --> 07:29.440
and saying, Oh, look at the foreigner, or is that is that foreigner going to stay here with us?

07:29.440 --> 07:36.640
Yeah, that's that's like very in your face. And I since I've experienced that, I mean, that's

07:37.440 --> 07:43.360
maybe that's not exactly what he's talking about. But maybe it is maybe it's like, you know,

07:45.040 --> 07:48.480
I think I totally get your point there. Because like, I remember when I came here, when I was a

07:48.480 --> 07:54.880
kid, much younger, even things like, I mean, I think Canada is okay. But like a lot like

07:54.880 --> 07:59.600
Australian slang and colloquialisms, I was kind of like, what the hell are people talking about?

07:59.600 --> 08:05.840
You know, and like, it's not even the direct judgment or the gaze of the others, just generally

08:05.840 --> 08:12.800
me, myself, I'm trying to see where the hell do I fit in here. And then what I even the reason

08:12.800 --> 08:17.200
Todd McGovern's work was really helpful was to be honest, I agree with you, I think there are like

08:17.200 --> 08:23.280
certain limits, there's like, like, there are like, some of it can be a lot more palpable and

08:23.280 --> 08:29.440
visceral was that because I realized, Oh, the trick is to kind of embrace your alienation to not like

08:30.080 --> 08:34.960
to not as a not I don't try to this used to be the case where I tried to like overly attach

08:34.960 --> 08:39.120
myself with a certain culture, be the Australian culture or the Sri Lankan culture, which is the

08:39.120 --> 08:43.760
culture that my, you know, I was born and raised in. But I realized no, no, no, that's all of that

08:43.760 --> 08:49.600
is fine. Like, I'm not, I'm not going to actively negate that side of me, of course, not that's

08:49.600 --> 08:56.160
impossible. But also, I won't overly attach myself and be like, Oh, this is why I'm this is a true

08:56.160 --> 09:02.480
core of my being. I like the whole kind of idea that in some sense, at the core, what we are is

09:02.480 --> 09:08.000
like this kind of abyss or like a void. At least for me, being again, being a migrant, probably

09:08.000 --> 09:12.400
that that's probably the reason I like that idea a lot more than trying to find like an

09:12.480 --> 09:18.400
authentic kernel of who I am as a as a subject. Right, I see, I see. I feel like this is this

09:18.400 --> 09:22.800
can be a this can be a long conversation, an ongoing conversation. Yeah, we can definitely

09:22.800 --> 09:30.320
talk about this. Hopefully, we will be on with this. But I can, I can see how that could connect

09:30.320 --> 09:37.600
to your interest in cognitive science as well, because that's tacitly cognitive science has that

09:37.600 --> 09:44.400
attitude of not too much being attached to any particular culture. Interesting, what sense would

09:44.400 --> 09:50.080
you say? It's a very non-culture in general, I think cognitive science, cognitive psychology has

09:50.080 --> 09:57.840
a very non-cultural view of human nature, of a human being and human thinking. It kind of

09:58.480 --> 10:05.920
brackets out the idiosyncratic, local, you know, regional practices, regional, I mean,

10:05.920 --> 10:15.360
idioms of language. Everything becomes neat and formulaic and trans, maybe because you say

10:15.360 --> 10:23.600
transparent, not these like interpretive, indirect, you know, a cognitive psychologist or

10:23.840 --> 10:34.320
cognitive scientist doesn't necessarily, doesn't, I mean, habitually or typically pick out these

10:34.960 --> 10:41.600
indirect communications, communication practices of cultures where you have to be immersed in a

10:41.600 --> 10:49.680
culture to know how to decode a given sign, you know, that's what I mean. I see, I see, like it

10:49.680 --> 10:55.920
tries to be like trans-cultural in some sense. Yes, yes, or beyond cultures. Yeah, no, I think

10:55.920 --> 11:02.800
you're right, because like, in fact, I'm going to start my master's program next year, and it's

11:02.800 --> 11:10.320
partially in cognitive science, like it's a research program. And I think I'm more, let's say,

11:10.320 --> 11:16.800
I find more affinity with those kinds of studies, because something that also bothers me at the

11:16.800 --> 11:20.960
Buddhist is kind of like, sometimes people get into this, like, they focus too much on, like,

11:20.960 --> 11:26.000
the particularities, like other feminists or Marxists or black or white, and at one point,

11:26.000 --> 11:30.240
that's very exhausting, you know, it's like, yeah, I get it, we all have particular identities,

11:30.240 --> 11:36.240
but what about the universal? And that's why I'm more caught up in, like, I like the sciences,

11:36.240 --> 11:40.240
because there is this kind of universalistic with that has its negatives too, for sure,

11:40.240 --> 11:45.680
it's very absolutist. But I prefer that, I think you hit the nail on the head, that idea that

11:46.240 --> 11:49.360
we can go beyond the particular into something a bit more universal.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah, what you said partly is cognitive science. The other part, is it philosophy?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.240
It's philosophy, that's correct. Yeah, yeah. Okay, nice.

11:58.240 --> 12:02.880
One by the department, but they have like, it's a very interesting program, like they,

12:03.440 --> 12:09.040
they kind of intend them with some cognitive science fields. So I'm looking forward to it.

12:09.040 --> 12:15.440
You're going for it. Yeah, man. I'm like, I, I, I kind of want to do what you did, you know,

12:15.440 --> 12:20.560
go through the whole process, get my PhD, and then who knows, it might end up becoming a but not

12:20.560 --> 12:29.120
academic, but I'm going to do it, regardless. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Good luck. Thank you, man. Thank

12:29.120 --> 12:34.800
you. I might, in fact, I might come to you in the future for some advice. I hope I can.

12:37.920 --> 12:43.440
No, I'd always be appreciative of that. But yeah, as I said, David, sorry for my, you know,

12:43.440 --> 12:48.320
raspy voice. I'm getting over a cold. I'm telling you it's not. You sound, you sound fine. You sound

12:48.320 --> 12:54.800
great. Perfect. Thank you, man. Yeah, look, so what we kind of are hoping to do today is to discuss

12:55.360 --> 13:01.280
Bianchel Han's work and sort of let's do it in some sense, the propagandize as to why you should

13:01.280 --> 13:07.680
read Bianchel Han. But before that, David, I thought a rather pertinent question would be,

13:08.080 --> 13:15.200
my God, you've got over 400, I think, book reviews, probably a couple hundred on our YouTube channel,

13:16.000 --> 13:23.680
and you're an avid reader. And from different genres, certainly. But I want to ask you a question,

13:23.680 --> 13:32.400
which I think a lot of ink has been spilt over, which is how does one read philosophy and theory

13:32.400 --> 13:45.040
well? You know, Rahul, in general, I am, I find it very difficult to adopt that perspective,

13:45.040 --> 13:50.800
adopt that position of how does one do this and that. I know it's very attractive to go

13:50.800 --> 13:59.120
for that perspective and formulate a kind of advice, generalities, general guidelines.

14:00.080 --> 14:06.160
I can talk, I find it easier to talk about the things that I have,

14:08.560 --> 14:15.280
I have kind of slowly settled into the kind of perspective I've settled into and maybe the

14:15.280 --> 14:21.360
what I would say to myself, to my past self, maybe 10 years ago. In fact, in fact, I know

14:21.360 --> 14:25.680
that you're not the advice giving type in any way, but perhaps that's a better way to

14:25.680 --> 14:33.200
say what would you say to your past self. But there is that, that temptation to give advice

14:33.200 --> 14:38.480
and ask for advice, both are very strong. And it's the, it's a temptation to be, to take a,

14:39.920 --> 14:46.000
to, to help the other person save some time. You know, I really want other people to not go

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
through this inefficient process that I went through. But that's my mistake when I give to

14:52.000 --> 14:57.600
that, give into that temptation, because everybody needs to go through their own inefficient process,

14:57.600 --> 15:02.640
their own inefficient journeys, they own, they own, they own set of wrong books, the books that

15:02.640 --> 15:10.400
they will later be embarrassed to admit that they liked, they enjoyed. Okay, so back to the question,

15:10.400 --> 15:17.840
see if I can retrieve it, if I can remember it. How does one read philosophy? I mean, literally.

15:22.160 --> 15:31.760
Slowly, you know, slowly without rush, trying to not do too much. I always have this. I mean,

15:31.760 --> 15:38.240
I had it more, like, I just as to pick one example, the person that you read, one of the people you

15:38.240 --> 15:46.400
recently interviewed that I really admire, Simon Krishly. I have, when I become interested in somebody

15:46.400 --> 15:52.160
like, let's say Krishly, I was like, okay, here's a list of all Simon Krishly books. I'm going to

15:52.160 --> 15:58.240
start chronologically from beginning to the end, and read them all. And see, read all the other

15:58.240 --> 16:03.600
people that he was influenced by. And okay, if I replicate that whole process, what's going to

16:03.600 --> 16:09.600
happen? I will catch up to Simon Krishly. Okay, that's like, by that time, I'm like seven years

16:09.600 --> 16:16.400
old or something, or something, some age like that. I've tried to replicate Simon Krishly's

16:16.400 --> 16:23.280
reading and writing life. I mean, that's not a practical thing to do. And I don't think it's

16:23.280 --> 16:32.000
very useful. It's better to be, to accept that maybe I'll read one or two books by this thinker.

16:32.800 --> 16:36.960
And by the time I'm finished with the second book, maybe I'm too busy with some of their

16:36.960 --> 16:41.520
projects, some of the tasks, maybe my life will be interrupted by some facts of life,

16:42.240 --> 16:51.040
maybe ill health or, you know, losing a job or whatever. And then, when I get back to philosophy,

16:51.040 --> 16:56.480
I'm interested in some other topic or some other, some other thinker. So embracing all those

16:56.480 --> 17:03.040
limitations, all those, the negativity of the reading life, to borrow Byung-chohan's

17:03.760 --> 17:10.640
and others, Byung-chohan really brought this back and urged us to think in terms of negativity,

17:10.640 --> 17:18.240
to embrace that. All those features that are negative, you know, lack of speed. I'm not

17:18.240 --> 17:22.960
going to be as fast as I want to be. I'm not going to read as exhaustively as I want to be.

17:22.960 --> 17:30.480
I'm not going to remember as much as I want to remember, you know, so often I read again a text,

17:30.480 --> 17:36.720
it's like, oh, I can't believe I read this before. This is so fresh. This is so new. And

17:37.840 --> 17:42.240
there's this other kind of experience that you feel like I was never in a position to really

17:42.240 --> 17:47.920
appreciate this text until now. The passage by Nietzsche, you know, it was just after reading

17:47.920 --> 17:53.360
maybe something by Freud, and he returned to a passage, a paragraph from Beyond Good and Evil,

17:53.360 --> 18:00.880
and you realize, oh my god, what did I read before? I totally missed this. So sorry to

18:00.880 --> 18:06.960
give a long answer to that. No, that's a great question. I really liked the last point because

18:06.960 --> 18:13.520
I think in a conversation you had with Daniel Ghana, you know, OG Rose, they're lovely. I want to

18:13.520 --> 18:19.200
speak to them soon, but I want to first read that book before I have them on. He said a similar

18:19.200 --> 18:24.080
thing where, especially Nietzsche, because it's very aphoristic, so you'd read a bit of Nietzsche,

18:24.960 --> 18:29.520
and then you come back to him, let's say, two, three years later, and it's like a totally different

18:29.520 --> 18:38.080
author, you know, a totally different book in some sense. Yeah, I think for me, I see this,

18:38.080 --> 18:41.760
probably it's more for your temperament, because you're a bit of a calmer person,

18:41.760 --> 18:47.520
because I'm a bit of a neurotic person, and I like action, you know, like I'm a typical what

18:47.520 --> 18:54.320
we call this burnout subject in some sense, you know, like I like this kind of making, you know,

18:54.320 --> 19:01.120
Björn Scholland talks about making yourself into a project. You make yourself into like an

19:01.120 --> 19:09.200
entrepreneur of the self, right? And therefore, a part of me does like that because I enjoy it,

19:09.200 --> 19:14.320
but also the problem with that is I don't appreciate, as you pointed out, the slowness

19:15.040 --> 19:19.200
and like having the patience and even like that negativity where you detach yourself

19:20.000 --> 19:27.840
from this, let's call it noise or the hyperpositivity, and just sit with an idea. If it's for hours,

19:27.840 --> 19:33.360
if it's just like a verse or an excerpt from a book, hours and even days, and just like kind of

19:33.360 --> 19:39.280
meditating on it. And I found that that can be a lot more valuable than trying to read 60 pages

19:39.280 --> 19:48.240
in a day or try to like hit some reading quota or be it may. Yeah, yeah, I'm, you know, the older

19:48.240 --> 19:53.760
I get, the less I can relate to those things like reading quota, like read 200 pages a day.

19:54.800 --> 20:04.320
Why? For what purpose? Because the ultimate, the ultimate effect of these reading life is

20:04.320 --> 20:11.200
you want the effect to show up when, for example, you are talking to a kid that's like a nine year

20:11.200 --> 20:18.400
old, eight year old kid. That's where, you know, it's a critical moment where you want to behave

20:19.200 --> 20:26.160
somewhat wisely when there is a sensitive person who is listening to you or you're dealing with

20:26.160 --> 20:32.960
somebody. And if you're reading 200 pages a day, you're exhausting yourself and you're

20:32.960 --> 20:38.320
very impatient probably when you, when you meet that, you know, kid or student or a person who is

20:39.360 --> 20:47.040
really receptive to you, open to you at that moment. I think we should keep an eye out for,

20:47.040 --> 20:54.000
for those moments where we want the impact of our reading life to, to show up. You know what I mean?

20:55.440 --> 21:01.040
Because it's, it's all for something, you know, it's, it's supposed to be for something and that

21:01.040 --> 21:07.920
something is, there are very limited chance moments, there are very limited moments of our

21:07.920 --> 21:15.600
lives where you want to be like, I try to be a somewhat decent person and reading is, is hopefully

21:15.600 --> 21:22.800
part of that. Interesting. So for you, you always see reading as a, as a, to put it crassly as like a

21:22.800 --> 21:30.480
means to an end. Because for me personally, I find that I read for its own sake, like I don't

21:30.480 --> 21:36.880
expect anything out of it. Well, some, some books I do, especially if it's like preparing for like

21:36.880 --> 21:43.280
my studies or the podcast, but some other books, I read them for their own sake. That's a good point.

21:44.320 --> 21:50.640
You want to read for its own sake, but not purely. I mean, there's, there's a limit to that

21:51.600 --> 21:58.640
because sometimes it's work. Sometimes it's, it doesn't seem like you're doing it for its own

21:58.640 --> 22:05.840
sake because you're putting the, putting extra effort in. But yeah, that's why I kind of reach out

22:06.480 --> 22:11.520
for some purpose, some other thing out, outside of the intrinsic enjoyment. But yeah, I relate to

22:12.320 --> 22:15.760
reading for its own sake too, as something that is otherwise.

22:16.240 --> 22:20.000
Yeah. Now, I certainly see that because like, especially, you know, this is a beautiful thing

22:20.000 --> 22:26.320
about with all of its discontents, the internet and this kind of new podcasting, whatever you

22:26.320 --> 22:35.280
may call it, book, booktube, a community that's being built up. It's like given life of the mind

22:35.280 --> 22:40.640
or reading to use a bit of a pretentious term can be a, you know, very solitary thing. It's just

22:40.640 --> 22:46.080
lovely to see people that are, that truly cherish it, cherish it as much as we do. And we connect

22:46.080 --> 22:50.720
with them through the internet. And that, that for me, despite growing up with the internet,

22:50.720 --> 22:56.160
I've never gotten over the fact that you could just like you're in Canada and I'm here in Australia

22:56.160 --> 23:03.360
and we both connect over this shared love for, for reading and learning. I'll never, you know,

23:03.360 --> 23:08.720
get over that fact, that datum, you know? Sure, sure. But you know, there are all these people

23:08.720 --> 23:16.640
who cherish reading, but they show the cherishing moments when they turn on the camera, they say

23:16.640 --> 23:21.920
how much they cherish that, the activity of reading, but the camera is off most of the time and they

23:21.920 --> 23:27.280
don't always cherish it. I mean, we don't, I don't, I don't always enjoy reading and I don't, I don't

23:27.280 --> 23:34.800
have a very simple, always filled with pleasure relationship with reading. Interesting. To me,

23:34.800 --> 23:39.840
life of the mind is, is full of suffering and uncertainty. It's a struggle to struggle. I

23:39.840 --> 23:44.880
agree. I mean, I joke around, I joke around. I say that I'm probably a bit of like a masochist,

23:44.880 --> 23:48.800
because it's such a struggle to like, I mean, try to read like Hegel, right? I'm like, God,

23:48.800 --> 23:52.880
well, what the hell is this guy talking about? And I, or like, like corn, for instance, and then

23:52.880 --> 23:59.920
it's like, what, but nonetheless, you persevere. And it's never like a walk in the park and like

23:59.920 --> 24:04.240
a very pleasant experience. It's a struggle for sure that I agree. I couldn't agree more with that.

24:04.240 --> 24:12.960
Yeah. All right, David. So Bianchel Han, getting back to Bianchel Han. What, what, you know,

24:12.960 --> 24:19.200
especially being a cognitive psychologist, what would you say, what firstly attracted his work,

24:19.200 --> 24:26.560
because he's a critical theorist after all, what attracted you towards his work, but also what

24:27.920 --> 24:33.600
isomorphism similarities do you see between cognitive psychology and the work of Bianchel

24:33.600 --> 24:44.640
Han? Oh, I, let's first talk about how I got into his work. So I, and it was by accident.

24:45.440 --> 24:53.280
I have a friend who is here in Toronto, and he gave me a copy of The Agony of El Ros.

24:54.720 --> 25:03.520
And I noticed the kind of book it is first, I noticed, yeah, it's very short. It's, you know,

25:04.000 --> 25:11.760
50 something pages, I think 53 pages, excluding the notes. And I didn't read it immediately. I just

25:11.760 --> 25:15.680
read a couple of pages and I said, okay, I know, I know what the kind of thing that he's writing

25:15.680 --> 25:25.840
about. And three, four years later, I kept running into Han's work in bookstores. And I said, okay,

25:25.840 --> 25:30.480
I'm going to do that thing. I'm going to chronologically read his work beginning with the

25:30.480 --> 25:42.320
first burnout society. And so I started. And yeah, that's, that was my entry. I don't want to,

25:42.320 --> 25:47.600
you know, you asked about the relationship or possible relationships between cognitive science

25:47.600 --> 25:55.600
and Han. And this is difficult for me to say, given that you, you have this exciting project of

25:55.600 --> 26:02.400
going into cognitive science now. So I don't kind of, I'm hesitant to say this, but for me,

26:03.360 --> 26:06.480
let's say my own particular relationship with cognitive science, I don't have a very

26:06.480 --> 26:14.960
high opinion of it. So I would say, for me, becoming increasingly critical of cognitive

26:14.960 --> 26:20.560
psychology, the experimental method as applied to the study of human beings.

26:21.520 --> 26:28.000
Han became, eventually, he became one of the resources for me to think about

26:29.360 --> 26:36.960
the conduct of psychologists, my colleagues in academia. So when he talked about, you know,

26:36.960 --> 26:45.840
the shrinking of time, we don't have this long view or relationship with time as something

26:46.400 --> 26:54.240
that can linger, that continues, that covers a long span, that our form of consciousness

26:54.240 --> 26:58.000
is structured such that time is very brief for us, that we have this

27:01.280 --> 27:09.680
more metaphorically, at least ADHD-like kind of subjectivity, where at any given moment,

27:09.680 --> 27:15.280
we want to say wow and be surprised and be impressed by a research project in cognitive

27:15.280 --> 27:21.120
psychology. I felt like every meeting, every kind of departmental presentation, it started

27:21.120 --> 27:28.560
from scratch, no history, no memory, a quick presentation and a quick wow. And soon after

27:28.560 --> 27:34.400
it was done, that's it, it was gone. So you become like, it becomes a piece of entertainment and a

27:34.400 --> 27:43.200
piece of, you know, easy, quick persuasion. And if you look back, there's not much relationship

27:43.200 --> 27:49.760
between different projects that people are pursuing. And so when I read and thought with Han, I became

27:50.640 --> 27:57.360
kind of aware of this, this thing that was my career, this is just one expression of

27:57.360 --> 28:06.000
something bigger that Han is talking about, namely the neoliberal order, the neoliberal subject of

28:07.040 --> 28:13.280
which, you know, one way it shows up is in research, research projects, projects, you know,

28:13.280 --> 28:21.360
in general, projects. Yeah, in fact, I recall in one of the videos, I think the one you made on

28:22.240 --> 28:29.040
Psychopolitics, you even mentioned that in academics, like, because again, we're all part of the old

28:29.040 --> 28:35.600
immersed in the neoliberal symbolic order, let's say, right? And academics constantly love coming

28:35.600 --> 28:41.760
up with new terms, new words, new ideas, it's a novelty, you know, we fetishize novelty.

28:42.400 --> 28:49.840
And that is because we have this kind of almost imperative to create, to produce.

28:50.720 --> 28:54.320
Yeah, you gotta have a thing, academia, you gotta have your thing. Exactly. Yeah.

28:55.200 --> 28:59.120
That's fascinating. That's fascinating. But first of all, David, I want to say I really do,

28:59.120 --> 29:04.160
that means a lot to me that you took my personal career into into account when

29:04.160 --> 29:10.400
replying to that, because I mean, look, I, it's interesting. I know the, I've spoken to many

29:10.400 --> 29:15.760
people like yourself, who are academics, who've been through this journey. And I know it's,

29:15.760 --> 29:20.720
it's, it certainly has its own problems too, you know, university itself, the neoliberal

29:20.720 --> 29:28.560
university has its shortcomings. And in fact, perhaps it's, it's, it's becoming another corporation,

29:28.560 --> 29:34.000
unfortunately, like, like, what we see in the rest of society. So I mean, in fact, you're gonna

29:34.000 --> 29:39.840
Yeah, please. But I would never discourage you to, I would never discourage you from pursuing

29:40.640 --> 29:46.560
that way of life, because the problems that we attribute to university life

29:47.280 --> 29:52.080
are not unique to it. Indeed. We become, we become disappointed. Yeah, we become

29:52.080 --> 29:58.160
disappointed and disillusioned to find that university is not special, that it also has

29:58.880 --> 30:03.360
all those problems that we find in the corporate world, for example.

30:04.080 --> 30:10.720
So that's, I mean, there, there are still a lot of good things about having, having a life in

30:10.720 --> 30:17.440
university, you know, teaching and thinking and writing. It's still, there's still a lot of good

30:17.440 --> 30:27.600
in it. I should emphasize that for me, after, you know, six years, plus the PhD, getting the PhD,

30:28.400 --> 30:34.400
getting the PhD, that was another five years, postdoc one year. So about 11 years after about

30:34.400 --> 30:40.720
11 years, I realized, you know, I had enough of this. I want to do something else. I want to

30:40.720 --> 30:46.960
create something else. And I, it really became a question for me, like, if I don't do this,

30:46.960 --> 30:53.600
what would my life be like? What else could it be? So it was, I needed to

30:53.680 --> 31:01.200
become independent of this thing that I, I continuously criticized, because you can't,

31:02.160 --> 31:07.440
I mean, I, in good conscience, can't continue to criticize something while depending on it,

31:07.440 --> 31:14.480
still, while still getting my salary from it and say, Oh, I hate this. So, so I wanted to live

31:15.200 --> 31:22.320
with more integrity. So you know what, I'm going to put my money where my mouth is, or I want to,

31:22.400 --> 31:28.640
you know, I want to really, like, really mean this. I mean this critique. I mean it enough to say,

31:29.440 --> 31:35.600
I don't want to devote my life to it anymore. Well, in fact, let's, let's go here. Let's go a bit,

31:35.600 --> 31:40.320
delve a bit deeper into this, because, you know, let's, let's bring in the actual hands, you know,

31:40.320 --> 31:44.320
psychopolitics, excellent book, kind of he, you know, critiques, neoliberalism. So

31:45.120 --> 31:51.760
in the context of academia and the university, David, what would you say in your view is like

31:51.760 --> 31:55.920
the ideal, like the platonic idea, whatever you mean, called the ideal of the university?

31:56.720 --> 32:04.240
And then what is the current in actuality of the university we have in, let's say, most of the

32:04.240 --> 32:14.240
world, which people like the actual hand are critical of? Wow, that's a very difficult question. I,

32:15.200 --> 32:22.160
you know, we have to, that probably deserves a kind of round table discussion with a lot of people

32:22.800 --> 32:31.040
for me and help getting to that ideal, unpacking that really. But just let's say that for me,

32:31.600 --> 32:39.360
the idea, the ideal of university is not separable from the type of person that

32:40.160 --> 32:52.080
it's supposed to cultivate, a form of life, a form of life that is thoughtful, that is interested,

32:52.080 --> 33:01.200
that is open to a certain kind of wonder, a certain kind of openness,

33:01.680 --> 33:10.720
and keeps a certain mindset alive, keeps a certain spirit alive, spirit of inquiry.

33:12.320 --> 33:20.400
So it's a form of being that university is the platform, it's the medium for that form of life.

33:20.400 --> 33:26.000
So a lot is probably required for that. A lot of practices, a lot of support

33:26.880 --> 33:33.280
goes into that structure. So it's a structure, a place where, you know, a certain form of life can

33:33.280 --> 33:44.080
be supported. Right now is what we can say about university, how it deviates, is that people still,

33:44.080 --> 33:49.280
I think people still have that in the back of their mind when they do their works. But

33:50.240 --> 33:57.040
that ideal is something that is perpetually postponed. They will say things like, okay,

33:57.040 --> 34:03.680
this year I need to get these publications out. They're not important, I don't really believe in them.

34:06.000 --> 34:13.440
But I need to publish these couple of papers to get the promotion. And after that,

34:14.320 --> 34:21.360
I can focus on what I really want. But this thing, if you pay it, if you keep listening to people,

34:21.360 --> 34:28.960
if you keep paying attention, you hear the repetition of this pattern, that it's always later.

34:29.840 --> 34:34.480
And ultimately, it's after they retire that they want to do the thing that they want to do.

34:34.480 --> 34:39.760
They say typically in psychology was, people would say, I want to study consciousness after

34:39.760 --> 34:46.400
I retire. That's a typical thing. Although they get tenure, now that's stability.

34:47.200 --> 34:54.320
Yeah, tenure. But in some cases, even tenure is not enough. Because the department sometimes

34:54.320 --> 34:59.760
turns against you if you do what you like to do after you get tenure, because they say,

34:59.760 --> 35:02.720
we hired you to do this type of research, why did you stop?

35:03.040 --> 35:15.200
Yeah, it becomes, I mean, deviation from the ideal, I would say, happens when it becomes

35:15.200 --> 35:19.840
about performance and metrics, and the signs of accomplishment, the signs of success.

35:21.360 --> 35:24.400
Yeah, and then in fact, perhaps you could connect us to that idea that

35:25.360 --> 35:33.600
Björn Schullhand talks about his critique of big data. This goes really well again with

35:33.600 --> 35:39.760
your previous point. It's about positivity, right? It's a measure, everything is,

35:40.480 --> 35:47.760
you become another statistic, you put it in like a very cliched way. Whereas as something in thought,

35:47.760 --> 35:53.920
and in fact, he says it's theory, that it's a negativity. There's no, it's not a positive thing,

35:54.000 --> 35:58.240
you kind of remove yourself from being, and it's a different kind of mode of being.

36:00.800 --> 36:08.800
Yeah, remember, when big data was very hot and new, you probably remember this, there were these

36:08.800 --> 36:17.760
statements like, now we have so much data, that the need to think isn't, we don't have that need

36:17.760 --> 36:24.640
anymore. We don't have the need, people said that there was a statement about we don't need to think

36:24.640 --> 36:29.360
anymore, and we don't need theory anymore. That definitely, I remember that hearing that, reading

36:29.360 --> 36:37.120
that. All those things that we really want to become, to cultivate the capacity for those things,

36:37.120 --> 36:44.800
capacity for thought, capacity for theory, these serious consideration of this upper topic or

36:44.800 --> 36:52.000
subject matter, that requires lack and requires negativity, and also that having a relationship

36:52.000 --> 36:59.280
with negativity. Big data, the way people think of it as like, providing us too much, more than we

36:59.280 --> 37:08.320
need, we get so much that you almost become like, helpless, like you can't, it's not up to you anymore

37:08.720 --> 37:16.880
after crossing some threshold. It's not up to us, we just submit to it, we submit to the big data.

37:18.240 --> 37:25.440
Yeah, I mean, perhaps, I'd say for me, the almost quintessential example of this is health and fitness,

37:25.440 --> 37:29.280
you probably noticed that people have the watch where they track their steps,

37:29.840 --> 37:34.480
they track their sleep, they got the ring to, I think, track their pulse heartbeat. I mean,

37:35.440 --> 37:42.960
you know, you completely mechanize the human body to a point where I think in my view,

37:42.960 --> 37:50.080
it ends up, it ends up harming you because you know, you burn out from that kind of like, you get

37:50.080 --> 37:57.680
fatigued from this constantly having to, you know, measure yourself. In fact, a funny anecdote,

37:57.680 --> 38:02.480
one of my friends, I'm not going to mention her name obviously, she even has like a,

38:03.360 --> 38:09.280
almost like a Trello boat or like a project management, like a software she uses to keep

38:09.280 --> 38:16.640
track of her dating, her dates. So like, this person has these pros, these cons, and she's a

38:16.640 --> 38:22.880
lovely person, we get along really well, but, and we're quite close. So I always kind of make

38:22.880 --> 38:27.200
fun of her for this, you know, do you, do you keep track of like, how many times you had sex per

38:27.200 --> 38:33.120
week and everything? And I'm like, I even tell her personally, for me, if I live like that,

38:33.120 --> 38:37.120
I'd probably end up killing myself. I mean, I can't think of anything more depressing than

38:37.120 --> 38:42.960
having to track everything in that sense and making yourself a part of this big data ideology,

38:42.960 --> 38:49.840
let's say. Yeah, that's, that's very interesting. I haven't heard of anybody doing that, but

38:50.640 --> 38:55.200
we should still ask like, what is that tracking doing? It might not be doing what it might,

38:55.200 --> 39:01.760
what it would do for us. Maybe for some people, it just creates that, the sense of stability and

39:01.760 --> 39:08.160
that, you know, it might not result in anything, it might not lead anywhere, these dates that I'm

39:08.160 --> 39:14.480
going, but at least I have this, the records of it. Yeah, for some people, that could be, you know,

39:14.480 --> 39:24.240
they could write a novel about that. Maybe that's similar to like a technological record keeping.

39:25.760 --> 39:30.000
Yeah, I think a lot of it has to do with this. This, this, I mean, in fact, let me read out this

39:30.000 --> 39:38.320
quote, David, I was gonna, this idea where there's this lovely thing where it says, so the achievement

39:38.320 --> 39:44.640
subject, this is from the Bernard Society, Björn Chaland says, the achievement subject explodes

39:44.640 --> 39:53.920
itself until it burns out. In the process, it develops auto aggression that often enough,

39:54.480 --> 40:01.760
escalates into the violence of self destruction. The project turns out to be a projectile that

40:01.760 --> 40:07.600
the achievement subject is aiming at itself. And I think for me, this goes back to the idea that

40:07.600 --> 40:12.320
everything has to be a project, right, including academia. And then, and then the problem is,

40:12.320 --> 40:18.560
and just to kind of get at this bit, but like high level, in the book, he talks about how in

40:19.520 --> 40:25.840
disciplinary society, kind of what Foucault critiques, the, it's, it's still a society of

40:25.840 --> 40:31.040
prohibition, right, you do, thou shall not, you shall not have sex before marriage, you shall not,

40:31.040 --> 40:35.680
if you're, you know, gay marriage is illegal, whatever you may call it. Whereas in our society,

40:35.680 --> 40:41.200
in the society of the hyper positivity, we achievement subjects, everything is, yes,

40:41.200 --> 40:48.080
you can, yes, you should. And in that sense, I think we, we, we all of us, all of us, this is,

40:48.080 --> 40:53.680
in no way am I like sitting on like high chair, like pointing fingers, we all do this. I know I

40:53.680 --> 41:00.000
do this. We make projects out of our life and we ourselves become a project. So, and I think

41:00.000 --> 41:06.160
Han puts it beautifully, we exploit ourselves. And to get back to this thing about what you said

41:06.160 --> 41:11.600
about stability, I think there is, there is this idea at least in my view that this is feeling,

41:12.560 --> 41:18.000
you do get some kind of safety when you feel like everything is tracked, everything is in order,

41:19.040 --> 41:25.120
you know, everything, everything has a place, everything makes sense. Now, we don't know in

41:25.120 --> 41:31.360
reality if that stability exists, but at least the, the ideology is, yes, my, my romantic life,

41:31.360 --> 41:36.880
I can plan it out. I know, I'll know exactly who I'll meet, the kind of person I want, or the tick

41:36.880 --> 41:44.560
all the boxes. And of course, in, at least in my view, what happens there is we are always,

41:44.560 --> 41:50.320
we're always surprised. In fact, I'd argue the paradoxes, the more you try to order your life,

41:50.320 --> 41:58.720
the more control you lose. Right, right. It just also occurred to me that that, that's the closer

41:58.720 --> 42:04.560
to the transparency society to, to keep records of everything. You're making your dating life

42:04.560 --> 42:11.760
transparent to yourself, to yourself and potentially to other spectators, that this is what I'm

42:11.760 --> 42:16.800
doing and I'm recording everything here. And the other thing that happens with that is everything

42:16.800 --> 42:23.920
becomes the same because person number one and person number seven, because you kept track of them

42:24.800 --> 42:30.720
with respect to similar dimensions, they are comparable, they all become comparable. And the

42:30.720 --> 42:39.680
otherness about them, their alterity is pushed aside. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Could you elaborate on

42:39.680 --> 42:45.840
that point? I'm so glad you brought that up. The idea of otherness and alterity, how that,

42:46.480 --> 42:52.720
how that's a part of our subjectivity in some sense. Yeah, so I think that's, I mean, by,

42:53.920 --> 42:59.440
by definition, that's a difficult concept to articulate because it's always what we call

43:00.160 --> 43:10.880
the other, truly other is always the thing that is not captured by the logic of our current project.

43:12.800 --> 43:17.120
Whatever that is not that you're not capable of because of the way we have positioned ourselves,

43:17.120 --> 43:25.360
the kind of structure that you're participating in. By virtue of that, the other is outside of

43:25.360 --> 43:35.760
that, and we are not ready to even understand it. What we can do is to be, we could say vulnerable

43:35.760 --> 43:44.480
to it, we could become vulnerable to its effects, like having an argument with, with, you know,

43:44.480 --> 43:51.600
with our significant other, having something that a disagreement that seems irreconcilable,

43:52.320 --> 43:57.200
or having a problem with a stranger and not even knowing what the root of the problem is.

43:59.840 --> 44:09.200
So Han, identity, he argues that we are inclined to move in the direction of sameness,

44:09.760 --> 44:17.520
the tyranny or the terror of sameness to impose structures and logic, kinds of logic,

44:17.520 --> 44:25.840
when we deal with different kinds of situations, impose kinds of logic that simplifies what we

44:25.840 --> 44:33.360
are encountering and treats plurality in terms of same, so same kinds of stuff. So in dating,

44:33.360 --> 44:40.400
for example, the example, very useful, we just number people or the books, you know,

44:40.400 --> 44:45.040
hundred classics that you should read before you die, you know, that's like, that's also a kind

44:45.040 --> 44:52.080
of unfair way of treating books because, you know, you want to hundreds and one is probably the best,

44:52.080 --> 44:58.400
hundred is like, yeah, okay, you can skip that. But the logic of sameness is imposed on that,

44:58.400 --> 45:05.520
on that list, you know, it turned the thing turns into a list. So it's, it's very interesting by,

45:05.520 --> 45:11.680
by getting out of that, funny enough, the effect of that is the kind of liberation,

45:11.760 --> 45:18.160
you liberate ourselves by getting out of the logic of sameness. Indeed. And the detail of that,

45:19.600 --> 45:26.320
the detail of that is in a book that I haven't yet finished by Han is the expulsion of the other.

45:26.960 --> 45:36.320
But just like any, any of his books, it's great by really continuing and, and

45:36.560 --> 45:43.840
and illuminating what he has done in the previous books. So, for example, you just touched on the

45:43.840 --> 45:50.800
burnout society. And he, he says this, he makes this really beautiful, very insightful observation

45:51.440 --> 45:57.600
that, you know, he's talking about the new liberal regime and self exploitation. Okay.

45:58.160 --> 46:03.040
But we perceive that self exploitation as freedom and we are, we think that we are self

46:03.600 --> 46:11.760
optimizing, self realizing. And he writes here, there is no other as exploiter to the,

46:11.760 --> 46:15.760
the exploiter is not another forcing me to work and alienating me from myself. Rather,

46:15.760 --> 46:21.680
I voluntarily exploit myself in the belief that I am realizing myself. This is the diabolical

46:21.680 --> 46:28.560
logic of neoliberalism. And then he writes, hence the first stage of a burnout is euphoria.

46:29.520 --> 46:33.280
The first stage of burnout is euphoria. You're happy in the beginning.

46:34.880 --> 46:42.800
I plunge into work euphorically until I finally collapse. This is, this is really,

46:43.600 --> 46:50.640
it's a transferable insight. You might think about this type, there's a type of person who

46:52.080 --> 46:57.680
gets in and out of relationships, and they get really passionate. When they start a relationship,

46:57.680 --> 47:05.120
they get this euphoria of, I finally find, found the one. And of course, these problems,

47:05.120 --> 47:10.960
they're waiting. The problems are brewing from the very beginning. It's not that something goes

47:10.960 --> 47:16.640
wrong. No, the very structure from the very beginning is set up for that huge, heated

47:16.640 --> 47:24.640
disappointment to happen and for the explosion, for a breakup to happen explosively. So this

47:25.600 --> 47:32.640
is now in here, in this passage, Han is describing burnout as something that

47:33.600 --> 47:40.240
we set ourselves up for from the very beginning, when we euphorically start engaging with the project.

47:42.560 --> 47:48.160
Indeed, like the absolute high and then the complete destruction, isn't it, that comes along

47:48.160 --> 47:52.640
with it? Yeah. Yes, they're part of the same, they're part of the same pattern.

47:53.200 --> 47:58.880
Yeah, because we set it up through this kind of, let's call it within our society, kind of what

47:58.880 --> 48:05.680
the ideology we hold, hold dear to us. And two points on that, David, one other really good

48:05.680 --> 48:12.000
example you used to this kind of the massification of like sameness is traveling. I remember you,

48:12.000 --> 48:17.920
I think you used it in one of your videos. And look, I'm not again anti-traveling, I'll be going

48:18.000 --> 48:24.640
on a holiday next month, in fact, but I am very, very critical and I even find it, I'm a bit even,

48:24.640 --> 48:30.720
I even detest this idea that, you know, I got to tick all the boxes every single city of Paris

48:30.720 --> 48:36.560
or Florence or Berlin or and go to Europe, especially, you know, because us Australians here,

48:36.560 --> 48:41.920
we're quite away from Europe. So love going to Europe. And then the point you make is that it's

48:41.920 --> 48:46.880
kind of cheap and you go to Paris, you stay there for four days and you're like, I know Paris,

48:47.520 --> 48:53.040
you know, but of course, that's not how you get to know a city. And then that same ideology,

48:53.840 --> 48:59.360
it comes along to other human beings too, you know, you start viewing even humans,

49:00.080 --> 49:03.440
it's just another person, just another city, just another commodity.

49:03.440 --> 49:10.400
Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of, it's almost tragic that we get very close to getting somewhere,

49:10.400 --> 49:14.560
you know, when you travel, when you go to Paris, you just get so, it's such an opportunity.

49:14.560 --> 49:22.160
It's an amazing city, amazing history. You go there and then people miss it.

49:22.160 --> 49:25.920
People miss the fact that it's supposed to be enjoyed, it's supposed to be an experience,

49:25.920 --> 49:32.000
you're supposed to be surprised. And maybe you go through the Paris syndrome, that's another

49:32.000 --> 49:39.600
whole thing. But to what I noticed, unfortunately, the tragedy is that for, for people, for some

49:39.600 --> 49:47.440
people, it becomes about taking photos and then it doesn't become enjoyable until the moment they

49:47.440 --> 49:53.600
are back and they show those pictures to their friends. That's when they start enjoying it.

49:54.240 --> 49:59.920
I mean, that's just, I mean, that's kind of, that's a kind of sickness, isn't it?

49:59.920 --> 50:03.680
It is a kind of sickness, but also I think it's, you know, in the Transparency Society,

50:03.760 --> 50:09.760
he has a one essay called the Society of Exhibition, where you've got to exhibit your,

50:10.480 --> 50:15.120
it's like, until you got the approval from the other, in this case, the gaze of the social

50:15.120 --> 50:20.640
media, it's as if you haven't really done this thing. You know, and I think

50:22.320 --> 50:28.960
he says, the Society of Exhibition is a society of pornography, that kind of hyper unconcealment.

50:28.960 --> 50:35.680
I really do like that because it's like, it's as if we want to get rid of this friction

50:36.320 --> 50:42.480
between us and the world. We want it to be completely seamless and there's no, it's just

50:42.480 --> 50:46.960
whatever it's in here, it has to be out there. Whereas for me, the subject, what's really

50:46.960 --> 50:51.680
fascinating, and I think Jijek gets this point quite well, is that we are a complete fisher in

50:51.680 --> 50:58.000
being, we're, it's this absolute negativity that that kind of, we kind of, in many ways, we don't

50:58.080 --> 51:02.640
fit into the subject, doesn't fit into the order of things because of this absolute negativity

51:02.640 --> 51:09.440
that that's created. And with this need to be completely transparent, we completely

51:12.320 --> 51:19.120
jettison this negativity. Right. And that's where for me, traveling, because, you know,

51:19.120 --> 51:23.920
if you think about it, I am all about, in some sense, I'm like a levinazi and like, I really

51:23.920 --> 51:29.840
believe in exposing yourself and opening yourself to the other. And travel, you could argue, is a

51:29.840 --> 51:33.920
beautiful way to do that, you know, opening yourself to just a completely different culture,

51:35.040 --> 51:42.480
a different mode of being even. But if it becomes kind of like the whole, it's just going to become a

51:42.480 --> 51:47.600
game for, you know, Instagram selfies. So it was put up on the internet. There's no, there's absolutely

51:47.600 --> 51:53.200
no opening yourself to the other. It's just simply another exhibition. It's another, yeah,

51:53.200 --> 52:00.320
another box to take. Yeah, yeah. All the inconveniences of traveling and people,

52:00.960 --> 52:06.800
the parts that we are inclined to not appreciate, I mean, those are the real, those are when those

52:06.800 --> 52:18.080
are the moments where we encounter what is not planned, what is the real justification for

52:18.080 --> 52:24.400
getting out, getting, getting into the, indeed, into the journey. Just, it's a really good point

52:24.400 --> 52:28.880
you make about the inconvenience, because I know you've been on Kareel Last, the philosophy

52:28.880 --> 52:35.760
portal, his podcast, love his work. I mean, I feel like the, I'm hoping to talk to him one day.

52:35.760 --> 52:40.080
I'm probably going to have like one of those moments, because he was one of the first people

52:40.080 --> 52:46.160
that I, his channel was the resource for me to understand, you know, probably five years ago.

52:46.240 --> 52:52.160
I went through his lectures and then Hegel and he's an amazing, amazing elucidator. But anyway,

52:52.160 --> 52:56.800
leaving that aside, he has this point about inconvenience. He says that, you know, we,

52:57.440 --> 53:01.280
we have these kinds of conversations online and it's fantastic. Like it's just,

53:02.000 --> 53:07.360
it's like an oasis of where we could just get lost in this world of thinking and theory and

53:07.360 --> 53:13.280
philosophy. But he does say there is something very convenient about this, right? As in, let's

53:13.280 --> 53:19.200
say David, you and I, we wanted to have the same conversation in person. You're in Canada, I'm in

53:19.200 --> 53:25.200
Australia. We may have to organize our flights, take up a lot of time from our day and there's

53:25.200 --> 53:32.160
like a lot of friction for us to have this in person. But now all I had to do was just, I mean,

53:32.160 --> 53:36.880
I sent you an email and a bit of back and forth, but that's nothing compared to, and then, you know,

53:36.880 --> 53:42.000
click a button, zoom video opens up. All of that friction is taken away. And I wonder

53:42.720 --> 53:49.280
if there will be some kind of richness that comes out of this friction, if it is in person

53:49.920 --> 53:54.720
and how it's in the future of like this kind of what we're doing in this community, how that

53:54.720 --> 53:59.760
would be where I'm, I'm trying to see as I grow this community, if I can do a bit, a few more

53:59.760 --> 54:07.440
in person events in Australia, just so that there's something, the difficulty of that itself

54:07.440 --> 54:12.400
makes it worth it, if I could put it that way. Yeah, that's a great idea to do more in person

54:13.280 --> 54:20.640
stuff. Just, you know, if you and I just to use this to stay with this example, if you and I were

54:20.640 --> 54:26.960
planning to meet, it could not just be because it's such a big distance between us. It can just be

54:26.960 --> 54:31.600
like, okay, we talked for an hour and then bye, see you later. It has to be like, okay, if you're

54:31.600 --> 54:36.000
visiting, you know, I have to kind of help accommodate you and help find accommodation for

54:36.000 --> 54:43.520
you or vice versa. It becomes more than what we were initially interested in. We have to embrace

54:43.520 --> 54:49.200
more. We have to kind of accept that there's going to be more inconvenience for this, you know,

54:49.200 --> 54:56.000
a small slice of interaction that I was planning. I'm supposed to, I'm forced to have like a whole

54:56.000 --> 55:02.880
bunch of unplanned, you know, but necessary, it's going to be a lot of necessary evil in that process.

55:03.600 --> 55:12.880
But technology is really, it's good at eliminating all those and giving us just that one slice,

55:12.880 --> 55:17.360
precisely the slice that you asked for, you're going to get it and then turn it off, turn off the

55:18.240 --> 55:28.080
zoom and you're done. But there's a, we can be skeptical of that purity.

55:29.040 --> 55:33.120
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I've always been skeptical of this idea of like,

55:33.120 --> 55:39.920
pristine purity, refined things. I, I, I, here's a game where I'm sorry, I keep referring to

55:39.920 --> 55:44.000
Jack. He is one of my master signifiers. I refer to him a lot because I've essentially,

55:44.000 --> 55:50.000
my ontology is just ontology. And like, he always talks about that yet. There's something it's in

55:50.000 --> 55:58.240
the, it's in the, the flaws, it's in the, the lopsidedness, it's in the, the antagonisms,

55:58.240 --> 56:03.360
whatever you may call it, it's, it's in the error itself in some sense, the answer lies.

56:04.160 --> 56:11.120
And, and I liked the idea that complete order is felt, that's fascism, but also

56:11.680 --> 56:16.240
complete disorder, that's anarchism, right? So I'm not trying to say you need to get

56:16.240 --> 56:20.720
find the best of both, but I think that the trick is to find disorder in the order.

56:22.160 --> 56:27.280
And to see that, okay, yeah, yeah, things can be seamless, but there's some, there's value to

56:27.280 --> 56:36.240
things going wrong too. An example is that way, you know, when the Frenchy jokes around,

56:36.240 --> 56:42.240
when the cheese went off, the French took that, that error, the fault, and now we have blue cheese

56:42.320 --> 56:48.400
over the wine, it went off, no, we have champagne. So it's to find something positive in the

56:48.400 --> 56:55.360
error, something productive in the error itself. Yeah, yeah, philosophy itself could be an error

56:55.360 --> 57:01.680
in normal conversation, in normal discourse. You know, there was this guy, Socrates, for example,

57:01.680 --> 57:08.000
he kind of introduced weird variations in questioning people and questions and answers.

57:08.880 --> 57:12.880
But to make that official, to officially bring that into conversation,

57:14.320 --> 57:17.280
that would be the active philosophy, the decision.

57:20.240 --> 57:25.920
And speaking of, David, I would like to revisit the agony of eros, because this is certainly,

57:25.920 --> 57:30.640
I think, but I think it's the same for you, burnout and agony of eros are my favorite.

57:30.640 --> 57:36.000
I've only read probably four or five of his books. So I certainly love this book.

57:36.800 --> 57:41.520
One point I want to make about the agony of eros is, and I don't know what your thoughts on this

57:41.520 --> 57:49.040
are. So we talk a lot about this, like the other and how the other can be a complete alien other,

57:49.040 --> 57:58.240
and then they kind of disturb our sameness, our controlled life. But I really liked the kind

57:58.240 --> 58:03.680
of the notion that Alain Bajor makes that, yes, it's true that the other is completely alien,

58:03.680 --> 58:11.440
you can never plan the love event in that sense. But when he says love takes two,

58:12.000 --> 58:17.360
and in the event of love, by allowing yourself to like opening yourself up to the other,

58:18.000 --> 58:23.520
there is a higher truth or a newer truth created. So love becomes a project in that sense. So it's

58:23.520 --> 58:29.440
not that the other is a complete alien and then your life is complete chaos. But through this,

58:29.440 --> 58:34.800
again, it's paradoxically through opening yourself up to this other, you've, in some

58:34.800 --> 58:41.520
sense, you find a truth even about yourself. And I'm wondering, I don't know if that makes

58:41.520 --> 58:46.000
sense. I'm sorry for being a bit long winded. No, no, no, no. Just like if you want to comment

58:46.000 --> 58:51.360
on that, because for me, that's a beautiful idea of like letting ourself love and opening

58:51.360 --> 58:58.720
us up to the other. Yeah, I think maybe something that you also are, you're also expressing in that

58:59.840 --> 59:10.720
with that sentiment is the idea that the other is not just outside, that it's an inner other too,

59:10.720 --> 59:20.240
that you discover about yourself. That this logic of sameness, this imposition that we do,

59:20.240 --> 59:27.440
we also impose it on ourselves. Like the idea of waking up and planning every minute,

59:27.440 --> 59:33.040
since the moment you wake up until the moment optimizing everything, optimization is really

59:33.040 --> 59:38.800
based based on the assumption that I know myself. I know what I can do. And I know what I want to do.

59:39.600 --> 59:46.160
But it's, it's a very dull life if I operate with the assumption that I know everything

59:47.040 --> 59:53.840
that about myself, I know what I'm what I should do. So yeah, I agree that it's, you know, our

59:53.840 --> 01:00:01.200
relationships that we find aspects of ourselves that we wouldn't, we wouldn't find.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:09.520
Long time ago, I had a friend who is a very close friend, and in a moment in a sentimental moment,

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:15.440
she told me, if I don't talk with you for too long, I will forget who I am.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:23.440
And it really made me think, I feel, I feel like that's a general statement that we could apply

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:30.560
to all good friendships. And if we don't get in touch with our good friends, we will really lose

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:36.320
touch with ourselves. Because they provide us with a place, a good friendship, a good conversation,

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:46.800
provides us with a place to be, to dwell, to express who we are, and then be responded to.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:54.240
And in that dialogue, we, we find something. And that part of that something is, is ourselves.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:02.480
But it's not the narcissistic self. It's the, is the other self, if you will.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.360
And how have you found, because I was going to read out, it's a bit of a mouthful. So let me

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:13.520
in fact, because the book ends the agony of heroes. And I'm so glad you brought up your friend,

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:19.200
because the, the part I'm going to read is about friendship. So beyond Shalan ends the,

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:26.880
the book saying, the philosopher is a friend, a lover. Here, the lover is not an outward personality

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:34.720
and empirical circumstance, but a presence that is intrinsic to thought, the condition of possibility

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:42.800
of thought itself, a living category, a transcendental lived reality. And this is perhaps my favorite

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:48.960
part, because this idea of thinking, thinking in the strong sense begins with heroes.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:58.320
To be able to think, one must first have been a friend, a lover. Without heroes, thinking loses

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:09.280
all vitality and turmoil and becomes repetitive and reactive. Heroes infuses thinking with desire

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:16.800
for the atopic other. So, you know, and this your friend said that she, she kind of

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.680
forgets even who she is, unless she's in dialogue with you. And I'd say I have a lot of friends in

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:27.760
my life where I do know if I don't talk to them, eventually I start forgetting even who I am.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:36.160
I love that line. Thank you for reading that. To be able to think one must first have been a

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:46.320
friend, a lover. It's so true. And it, you know, because people who have an interest in philosophy

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:53.440
and have been involved with philosophy for years, they might forget that, that it didn't begin with

01:02:53.440 --> 01:03:02.080
an interest in a given book or a philosophical question. It began as maybe in a context of a

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.560
relationship with a teacher or with a friend, with a person who seemed very intriguing.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:15.760
There was friendliness there at the bottom. And that's why a lot of times, philosophical

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:22.400
questions begin with a line of thought with something like, what is love? What is true love?

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:29.600
Or, you know, in some movies, characters ask each other, can men and women really be just friends?

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.880
You have a relationship with someone and within the context of a relationship, friendship,

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:42.240
those questions are posed. But the engine of those questions is their relationship,

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:48.080
that's the idea. But it's so easy to forget that. And that itself is also interesting

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.720
that we forget. Yeah, yeah. No, I think that's beautiful.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.880
Well, I feel like we did touch on the burnout society, but I perhaps maybe let's try that,

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:06.480
because for me, what I was thinking was, so for myself, I've been recommending

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.840
Byung-Shul Han to many people and even sharing your videos around, in fact.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.680
And one reason I do that is because I think people that aren't, and I don't mean this in

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:20.800
any way in like a super serious, you know, condescending way, people that aren't, let's say,

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.960
obsessed with reading the way you and I are. You know, this is why I started the question

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:32.720
with how do you read philosophy? Because, you know, philosophers write in dense ways that are,

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.960
you know, esoteric and abstruse, it's really hard to get through to them. And for me, Byung-Shul

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:45.200
Han is certainly an exception, because I find his work extremely accessible, like he writes in very

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:54.080
clear, concise terms, plain language. And that's, that's one reason, you know, I talk about him.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:59.520
So, but then the other reason is because he theorizes, he's a, he's a living, breathing,

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.160
critical theorist, right? It's not, we're not reading Heidegger from the 20th century or,

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.760
or Adorno from the 20th century, we're reading a person that's, that's in, for instance, in

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.240
Transparency Society. He talks about Facebook, you know, he talks about social media. So,

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:21.040
I'm curious to ask a rather, there's a bit of a banal question, but I think it's worth discussing

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:26.320
what are your views on the world of social media? This, I mean, I'm going to stop calling it the

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.560
online world, because I don't think it's the online world anymore. It is our world. It's our

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:37.440
life world. Social media has become, it's become the modern church that become the, the town square

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:43.440
in some sense. So, just through the kind of the Beyoncé hard framework, let's say, or worldview,

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:51.200
what are your views on the world of social media? Yeah, great. The world of social media, these,

01:05:51.200 --> 01:06:00.880
these media platforms, there are places for consumption, but they're also, at the same time,

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:09.520
places for production. You and I, we both go there to produce, and they are not neutral. They,

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:15.680
they put demands on us. They put demands on us both when we are consuming and they put demands

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:22.640
on us both, you know, also when we are, you know, putting a producer hat or content creator

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:30.880
uncomfortable with that phrase. But, you know, we all, as somebody who posts, anybody who posts

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:38.560
regularly on, on YouTube, you know that the super ego of the YouTuber tells, tells him or her

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:45.840
or them that you should put, put something every week. You should post something. You should have

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:51.600
a posting schedule. Why? Because the platform demands you, demands that from you. Algorithmic

01:06:51.680 --> 01:07:02.480
DIA. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So social media, to me, every time I, I feel like

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:10.480
I'm really using social media for myself or for genuine human relationships, it always feels like

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:17.280
I'm cheating it or I'm getting away using it in the way that I'm not supposed to use. I have a

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:24.560
couple of friends that I, I messaged back and forth on Twitter, and Twitter with them is

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:29.520
like a messaging system. It's private messaging. You know, we have these long threads of

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:37.440
talking about books that we're reading. And Twitter or X is not supposed to be used that way.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:45.600
It has its own way of, that it wants you to use it. Ideally, you will use it in this way.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:54.640
So yeah, I think it's important to be, you're right. Han is important to read because he's writing

01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:02.160
for our time. He's writing for us. He really is writing about things that are aspects of our

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:10.960
reality. And that includes the digital media, social media, or, you know, quote on quote social

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:18.240
media because they're not really social. I don't always feel like I'm connected when I, when I'm

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.840
there. So I decided I myself, I don't know what your thoughts are on this, but I decided to limit,

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:29.360
really limit. So I don't have Facebook anymore. I don't have Instagram anymore. I just felt like

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:36.800
I need one or two. So I kept YouTube and, and X formerly known as Twitter. These two, I feel

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:45.600
like, okay, two, I can, I can deal with them. I can be careful with them. But when it comes to like

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:51.920
multiple, you're always catching up. I felt like I was always catching up to them. And you have

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:58.480
different people in your social circle. Everybody is more on one platform. It's really, it's really

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.760
strange. And you forget that, you know, these people are not really in your life, some of them.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.080
Some of them are not really in your life. You like delete Facebook, completely lose touch with

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:13.840
some of them. And I did. It was like, okay, what does that mean? I don't know.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:20.080
Yeah, I like that you said social media is not social. I couldn't agree more. In fact,

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.600
it's a, for me, it should probably be called something like a narcissistic media or something

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.760
because it's, I've realized that this goes back to the idea of you, you discussing sameness

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.160
in social media. It's the ultimate tool to make everything same. Because everyone's just

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:46.080
another follower, another comment, another listener. And then, which is why, in fact, I should have

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.560
spoken about this earlier. I love that you do the reading groups, where it's a much more smaller,

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:56.560
closer community. And you know, the people that it's not a parasocial relationship.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.320
That being said, David, I want to ask you this. I love asking this question from kind of people

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:09.520
who are into critical theory. So you probably noticed or observed a lot of technologists,

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.120
they, they think, okay, the solution is decentralization, crypto social media,

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:21.360
sorry, blockchain social media, or the solution is this new telegram or like, so

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:29.040
that they always look for technological solutions, right, as in to the, to our perils of our contemporary

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:35.600
world. Now, personally, I don't think the solution is technological, even though it's

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:40.560
interesting, you said that you cut off certain platforms, you cut off Instagram and Facebook,

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:47.600
and you only use Twitter and or X and YouTube, perhaps in that case, yeah, so those, those

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:53.840
platforms suit more of what you want to do on social media. But at a broader level, I'm wondering,

01:10:53.840 --> 01:11:00.960
do you think not that there are simple solutions to any of this, but at least to, let's say,

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.440
reduce human suffering? I mean, I think that's a good thing that people, people have through

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.760
social media. Do you think that the solution is technological? Do you think it's,

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:15.920
it's something a lot more social and ideological or political even? Or has there got to be

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:21.360
something which is kind of a dialectical between between the both, between both these, let's say,

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:32.080
camps? I'm not sure. I think if you think of technology broadly,

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:40.800
beyond just digital technology, I think the answer has to be technological. And that just means

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:49.200
being mindful of how we use our infrastructure, the platforms that we have. And, you know,

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.760
I'm using technology in the sense that, you know, a chalkboard is a piece of technology, too.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.880
You know, a matchbox is a, or a glass is, you know, a piece of technology. It, we,

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:10.000
any kind of solution requires its own technology and it's, it comes with its own set of beliefs

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.960
as well. So it's, I think they go hand in hand. The kind of world that is reflected in the

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:24.720
technologies that we embrace. But yeah, I'm not sure. I don't really spend much time thinking about

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:35.200
large-scale solutions. I don't think my brain really has those, those ambitions, unfortunately.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:42.720
The reason I asked was because I think my, in fact, I still haven't got like a thesis topic,

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:49.040
but something I would like to theorize on is for my masters is like on the philosophy of technology

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:57.440
and kind of see if I can do that. And, you know, a person who perhaps the single handle of the

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:03.520
essay that influenced me the most is Heidegger's A Question Concerning Technology. And like the

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:08.880
idea is that, you know, this is now kind of like a point that I think everyone agrees on that

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:15.920
technology isn't itself a neutral thing. It has its own metaphysic. It's always

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:22.960
tilted towards a certain side. It cannot be neutral or objective. So when we introduce a

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:28.720
technology that itself comes with its baggage of let's say ideas and presupposition. So,

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:37.840
and like, but then the question is, does that mean, does that mean the, the, that technology,

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.200
you know, the kind of the more than the Marxist sense that our material conditions,

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:48.400
the technology will change how people, people's beliefs, or is it more that the technology is

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.440
created out of more of like the background beliefs people already have. So to use again,

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:59.280
Bjarne Schultz's idea that the idea of burnout society, where everything becomes a project,

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:04.000
you'd see people create like myriad software tools to make him a productive

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:11.600
and tracking tools, you know, different kinds of, so for me, those, those technologies are kind

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:17.840
of like symptoms of what our society has at the moment, like our current, yeah, in some sense,

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:23.520
I'd call it a sickness, you know. And so I don't know, I'm just bringing some ideas out here just

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:28.720
to, you know, hear your thoughts, but I found them quite interesting. Example I sometimes think

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:38.320
about is, you know, when I, for the first time I joined Twitter, I really became aware of how

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:46.000
my mind slowly started to think in terms of tweets. You know, this was years ago, this was,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:55.840
I think, 2014. That was before I first deleted my Twitter account and joined again after some years.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:02.160
But this, this change happens, this change of, you know, you're plugged into a, to a piece of

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:13.200
technology and it morphs, it shapes the ways in which not necessarily the content, but it forms

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:18.960
your thoughts, say, okay, your thoughts appear to you, appear in your mind in the form of a, of a

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:24.400
tweet, or you get an idea and the idea is already pre-packaged. If you're a YouTuber,

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:31.520
your idea is already, it comes to you in the form of a, of a YouTube idea, idea for a YouTube video

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:37.440
and you write it down. I'm sure that's how novelists or short story writers experience their

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.960
lives. They experience a moment where an idea comes to them and they write it down potentially,

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:49.120
because they are, they're, they're plugged into that practice of writing short stories or writing

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:55.120
novels. We are plugged into these technologies that we have relationships with and they enable

01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:02.240
certain forms of, forms of expressions and prohibits other forms of expressions that, you know,

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:11.760
they're, they're out now. And if you take it, if you take a radical view, the kinds of expressions

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.920
that we come capable, we, we are capable of because of these technologies are the kind of,

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:21.760
kinds of expressions that we are capable of thinking. The things that we cannot say anymore

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:29.200
are the things that we cannot think anymore. So the, the very structure, the very form of our,

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:35.920
our beliefs are limited and formed. In addition to that, there's this time bound

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.880
and nature of the things that we say, you know, something comes to my mind. I

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:46.720
write a tweet about it and I let go of it. It's gone. I, my relationship to it becomes like,

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:53.120
oh, look at me. I did that. How many likes did I receive? Okay, 20 or 10 or two, you know,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:01.120
but it becomes like, it brings it into a particular logic of sameness that all thoughts are equal.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.640
You know, the difference between them is based on this metric of likes or views or whatever

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:15.840
the metric is that the platform tells us. You talked about that. You said these technologies

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:22.720
might shape our beliefs. But I think before that, that's, that's certainly true that they influence

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:29.280
what we believe, but they also influence how we believe. They influence how we relate to the things,

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:34.880
how strictly, how seriously we take them, or what else do we take seriously? Like,

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.400
is that what you meant by the form of belief?

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:46.800
Yeah. Yeah, the form. I see. The how, the how of our, you know, thoughts. Indeed. Indeed. In fact,

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.400
uh, you know, Simon Critchley, when I spoke to him, he made a really good point that, yes,

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:57.280
the internet social media has done, it's done wonders for philosophy because now everyone's,

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:01.200
you know, having these kinds of conversations, people are listening to philosophers online. It's

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.960
like everyone's exposed to philosophy in some sense. It's just, it's so convenient. But

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:13.280
it's been terrible for the novel. It's been terrible for long form. You, you kind of,

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:19.280
you sit in some corner, no distractions, and you just read a book. You read, I don't know,

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:24.640
James Joyce. So I'm not that I've read James Joyce, but you know, where you can, you can really

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.360
spend days and even months, you know, carefully gone through a book. And

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.800
because of this idea that as you, you said it, well, that all, everything's the same. All ideas

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:43.840
are the same. So no, no, no pinker, no novel, no work of art deserves some kind of salience over

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:50.080
every other book out there, you know, and, and, and I find that quite interesting. So, and,

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:55.760
and yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, because for me, I always thought that

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.200
it's, it's, it's a rather like simple thing to say that, oh, of course, technology affects us

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:05.920
and our thoughts. That's, that's fine. But my, something I really would like to explore more is

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:12.320
what, what creates technology? I mean, okay, a part of it is certainly this kind of creative

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:18.880
impulse that we all humans have this, this need to create. But the, the, the different kinds of

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:25.520
technologies we do create in our society. What's the, what are the, what's, what are the ideological

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:31.520
presuppositions we create them off? You know, be the productivity app and my background's in computer

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.840
science. I'm a software engineer. So I think a lot about software, you know, be the productivity

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:40.880
app or some kind of like sales app. So what are the presuppositions we have when we have the

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:44.000
motivations to create a technology? And that's the part that interests me.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:52.320
And is that motivation, is, is that motivation something that we get from the market?

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:58.000
Yeah. I mean, that's, that's a good question. Cause like, okay, a very, I think I'm playing

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.760
with it, put it as, yes, for money. I want to, you know, I want to make, I want to have like a

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:06.720
startup and make a lot of money. But I don't know. I don't think it's that simple. I think

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:11.040
that's a bit of a, because there are many ways to make money. I mean, you could, I don't know, you

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:17.280
could become a real estate agent and make a lot of money. But I find that these, especially in

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:21.680
the tech world, the more of like the hipster creative types, they have this, you know, they

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.840
have this very like, even like a messiah complex, I want to save the world. I want to create this

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:32.000
amazing software that, that revolutionizes lives. And so my question is where do those beliefs come

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:38.320
from? Right. But the very, the very statement that this is going to make money, that itself,

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:47.360
tacitly, it is expressing a set of beliefs about the market that a certain type of app will sell

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:51.440
because, that's true, because there's a demand for it, because there's a market for it, because

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:56.000
certain types of things are in demand, because we live in a culture where productivity is,

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:01.280
is in value and people are struggling with it. So a productivity app is going to be great.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.240
And so those, those kinds of,

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.800
now I stood one, I said, like, if you want to make money, you want to create something that,

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.880
that falls within the logic of the market. And then that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:21.440
Excellent. And said, I mean, oh, wow, it's funny, I lost record time. It's almost,

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.880
we, we got about 10, 15 minutes remaining. I was going to say, I wasn't very efficient.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:31.680
Oh, no, please. Oh my God, don't worry. This has been an absolutely enjoyable path. And

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
this has been an absolute pleasure for the police. I mean, look, I really hope we can have a lot more

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.800
conversations and like keep on, keep this dialogue going. But it's funny, I was going to say,

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:48.720
in the interest of time, and then I realized that the utter hypocrisy of that, that we're talking

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:56.160
about slowness and taking time, but, but just for the listeners, because really, you know,

01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:02.880
my, one of my goals with this conversation, again, see, I'm goal oriented was to kind of

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.760
propagandize for Bianchel Han. It really was that I really wanted more people to read him because

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:14.160
I think, I think that's great value in, in, in reading his work. Just, just, yeah, just for

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:20.880
the listeners to kind of put in like a very simplistic way, let's say, or like in a nutshell,

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:28.880
to use the term I hate. What do you think of Bianchel Han's perhaps his most valuable insights

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:34.720
and his most pertinent insights to our time and that perhaps can be a reason to read him?

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:44.640
I would say I would emphasize for people who are new to Han, I would, you know, my kind of

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:54.880
invitation would be, he is really great at connecting our very personal experiences,

01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:03.920
like the experience of being tired, the experience of not having enough mental energy to do all the

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:10.560
tasks that you're supposed to do, the experiences of loneliness, being tired and alone, you know,

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:21.120
at the end of the day. And all these experiences, he pays attention to them and he connects them to

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:30.800
broader patterns, broader trends in culture, in society, in technology. And that is really valuable,

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:37.840
I think. He keeps, he doesn't keep the discussion of private experiences at that level, at that

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:43.120
scope, at that original scope of interest. Yes, of course, we're interested in it, but

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:49.120
he helps us make sense of it by putting it in a larger context and different contexts. And

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:57.520
with the help of different thinkers, he introduces us to a host of other valuable thinkers like Foucault,

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:07.360
Plato, Nietzsche, Arendt, Hannah Arendt, and he's very good at connecting the

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.880
moments in our thought, in a discussion, with the right moments, the right person,

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:22.880
and bringing a passage, a quotation. He really has an, he's very artful in the use of quotations,

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:30.960
in the use of references. So that style, that general style, I think, is a great contribution.

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:41.680
He also highlights these structures that we are participating in. And becoming aware of these

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.720
structures, I think, is very helpful. We won't forget those structures that he's talking about.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:57.120
And then, like any good thinker, he also has his maybe points where we can critically engage with

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:05.360
him and respond to him. But that's, you know, that's part of the journey. Indeed. I don't

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:10.240
know if I, if I responded to your question. No, you absolutely did. In fact, just on that note,

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:16.720
you even, in one, in a couple of your book reviews, you do, you are critical. You do say,

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:23.600
yeah, that this is probably not, not my favorite book of hands. Yeah, I think that's, that's,

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:30.480
you hit the nail on the head, David, because for me, I think people who read a lot of self-help books,

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.920
they would really benefit from reading Marshall Hahn, because what he makes, he makes the

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:42.160
private social, he shows how the private is political, that what we think are these private

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:48.480
struggles, they, they, they are social struggles, that they're, they're a result of the society

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:56.000
we live in. So I think that's a beautiful place to conclude. And at the moments where he says,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.640
okay, if you just, you might think that if you just push hard enough, you will get to the,

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:05.040
to the bright side, you will get to the, you will solve it, you know, if you just

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.960
optimize yourself enough, but that's part of it. But that's not, that's not

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.040
the solution. That's, that's part of the structure of the problem.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.840
The solution itself is part of the problem. Yeah.

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:21.440
That's right. That's right. The promise of the solution is a false promise.

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:27.840
Thank you, David. I hope this is the first of many more conversations to come between

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.640
me. I hope so too. Thank you. I hope so too. Thank you so much.
