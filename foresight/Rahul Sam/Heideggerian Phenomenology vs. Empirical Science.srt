1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
I do want to say something about the way in which Heidegger

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,720
defines phenomenology, because I think it's a very brilliant

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,720
sort of description of it.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,200
And so Heidegger, when he's describing phenomenology and

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,600
being in time, but also in the lecture course, given a few years

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,080
before he published being in time, and that lecture course is

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,600
called the History of the Concept of Time.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
Sorry, just to clarify, so being in time is Heidegger's

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,400
machemopus, right? We should probably put that out. Yeah.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,040
Sorry, I didn't interrupt you. Jacob, keep going. Yeah.

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,800
No, no, you're good. Yeah, being in time is what he's most famous for.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,600
Even though, I mean, he wrote a lot. He has a lot of books. He has a lot of papers.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,360
His later work differs a little bit from his early work,

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,120
but there's also a dispute as to how real the turn is.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,680
Later Heidegger and early Heidegger, yeah.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,560
Yeah, and I'm not really knowledgeable enough to comment on how

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,840
different those two things are. I'm kind of working my way chronologically

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,480
through this moment's work. But yeah, in being in time and his earlier

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,240
lecture course, he described phenomenology by going back to

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,280
the ways in which the Greeks use the term phenomenon in logos.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,120
So he's kind of taking apart the term phenomenology

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:36,000
and separating it and looking to the Greek definitions of this.

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,920
And in the book, Heidegger says that the Greeks understood the term phenomenon

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,080
as, this is going to sound very obscure and esoteric, but I'm going to give,

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,800
hopefully, an easier to understand description afterward.

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,640
But he says, phenomenon is that which shows itself in itself, the manifest.

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,160
Typical Heidegger.

28
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,320
Yeah, and the term for the Greeks also carried connotation of bringing

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,960
something to life and eliminating. And then the logos, Heidegger explained,

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,320
the Greeks understood by the logos something like discoursing, but not just like,

31
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,840
not just dialogue and not just a verbal utterance, but

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,520
it's more of a discursive communication that lets something be seen.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:36,240
And so you could think of the logos as words, whether uttered or written down

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,560
or what have you, that point to something, they let something be seen.

35
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,040
It's kind of bringing something to life, it's bringing the phenomenon to life.

36
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,880
And so we want to understand this in a less obscure and difficult way than

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,840
Heidegger likes to put things. We can say something like, the logos points to the

38
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,040
phenomenon in such a way that the phenomenon becomes un-concealed or the logos allows the

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,840
phenomenon to come into view by looking and out of experience in such a way that it can be seen.

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,360
And so really, it's almost like your words should connect with something that can be

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,520
pointed out in experience or can be shown in experience. And so we're not,

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,400
and he contrasts this with the idea of free-floating concepts and words and ideas.

43
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,240
And by that, he just means something like, we don't want to abstract away so much from experience

44
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:40,560
that we're just playing language games. We want our words to be able to meet up with experience

45
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,880
in such a way that if I say something, it's all like in some of my papers about meaning what

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,360
I'm trying to do, as I'm trying to point to experience, I'm trying to point to

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,840
particular experiences and particular moments in particular experiences where maybe

48
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:08,320
someone might find meaning. So I'm just trying to bring something into view using words and concepts.

49
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,320
I'm glad you said that, Jico, because in one of your papers, I forget which one,

50
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,920
you've sort of touched on this, but a question that came to mind was,

51
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,440
so from the definition you gave, definition of phenomenology, how does that differ from, let's

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,160
say, the empiricist tradition or the empiricist approach, which tends to be quite popular these

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,280
days, especially in the world of artificial intelligence, where we think that our epistemology

54
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,240
or our knowledge or our truths of the world is revealed purely based on empiricism, which is

55
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,480
experiencing, measuring things, and that in some sense, the mind is a blank canvas and

56
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,240
the world just gives us information and input. So from the empirical approach, how does phenomenology

57
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,080
differ? So phenomenology is going to differ in the sense that, okay, so if we think about the

58
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:11,040
empirical approach specifically as it pertains to the sciences, we're getting, we're trying to get a

59
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,200
collection of experiences that kind of compile and point toward the same sort of thing and experience.

60
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,400
Now, a major difference, I guess, is going to be what it is we're trying to discern in empirical

61
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,640
science, as opposed to something like Pythagoras phenomenology, the way that I just described

62
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:42,080
phenomenology. With a scientific and empirical approach, we're usually looking at objects and

63
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:50,880
we're trying to figure out what sort of properties these objects have. And so, I mean, I guess physics

64
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,720
or chemistry is a great example of that. And we're trying to see maybe what

65
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,160
how two entities interact with each other. And we're going to perform experiments to do that,

66
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,640
and we're going to try to replicate the experiments. And we're going to try to not let our first person,

67
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,520
perspective, influence exactly what we're investigating. So phenomenology is going to

68
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,000
differ from that. In that we're not, we're not collecting data and we're not measuring stuff.

69
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,760
We're experiencing, we're trying to pay attention to the experience as it's experienced. So you're

70
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:33,680
not going to measure your experience of meaning, say you're going to more so, if you're doing a

71
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,680
phenomenology and you're trying to discern maybe what you find meaningful, you're going to more

72
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:47,600
sort of reflect on maybe the way that you feel when you were participating in a certain activity.

73
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,800
And from there, you might also start to look at the structures of the experience,

74
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,040
more so than just the feeling of the experience, which might be, you know, what's involved in

75
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,520
this activity or what's involved in this experience. What are the things that are essential to the

76
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,960
experience without which I could no longer say that it was a meaningful experience? Those are the

77
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,120
sorts of things that phenomena, that sort of questions phenomenology is going to ask. And

78
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,040
specifically high digger, because specifically for high digger, he's wanting to look, he's wanting to

79
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,560
discern the a priori structures of existence and experience, which is just to say

80
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:40,800
a priori meaning always already there. Like what's necessary? What are the, what, what, what

81
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,600
structures are necessary for this to exist or for me to have this particular experience?

82
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,520
Yeah, I guess I'll leave it at that for now, because otherwise I'm going to get into a really

83
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,200
deep, or you can ask a clarifying question, because otherwise I'm just going to go on at the end.

84
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,800
No, that was perfect, mate. I think in many ways you, you, you lead me to my next question. I mean,

85
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,320
I thought we were going to discuss existentialism too, because obviously it's kind of like the

86
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,080
precursor, so not the precursor, but it's highly correlated to phenomenology. But perhaps since

87
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,400
we're already on this topic, you see, in some sense, I kind of regret even asking that question,

88
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,040
because I'm coming to realize that maybe it's not fair to ask questions such as, oh, what's the

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,720
difference? Or what's the stark difference between phenomenology and science? Because if you think

90
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,120
of a field like, let's say, psychology or cognitive science, those fields have had a massive influence

91
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:48,000
by thinkers like Merleau Ponty or Heidegger by phenomenologists. So, well, the question I was

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,360
going to ask is how does phenomenology, and I was also going to say existentialism, but we didn't

93
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,880
get to that still, but let's just say how does phenomenology differ from a more scientific

94
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,120
approach? But maybe to make things even a bit more interesting, let's talk about, in fact,

95
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,680
how does it relate to fields like psychology and cognitive science, where in the world of,

96
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,320
in the scientific approach, what we always try and do is take the, remove the subject, so remove

97
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,920
the subjective experience. But clearly, there are some fields, even within science, where you

98
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,200
can't do that, you can't remove the subject from cognitive science or psychology. So maybe to make

99
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,080
things a bit more interesting, how do they correlate, how do they connect to phenomenology,

100
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,120
those fields I mentioned? Sure, sure. So I want to comment on cognitive science just a little

101
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,520
bit first, and then I want to maybe dive into a little bit of neuroscience and how phenomenology

102
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:48,720
might be related, because I actually presented a paper last year at a philosophy conference

103
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,120
hosted by a university in the Czech Republic on this topic of phenomenology neuroscience. But

104
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,600
before I get to that, something that I really appreciate about cognitive science is that

105
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:09,440
it really embraces the subjective experience. And like you said, you can't remove that from

106
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:21,520
cognitive science, cognitive science, necessarily. And I think the most prevailing approach in

107
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,920
cognitive science right now is 4E cognitive science. And that's just the 440s. I always forget

108
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,920
one, but it stands for embeddedness, embodied, inactive. And I, like I said, I always forget the

109
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:39,040
fourth one. I don't know why, but I'll leave a little caption or whatever, just too far. It was

110
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,600
all good. Yeah. Yeah, have somebody place in the comment. Kind of take the video. Yeah, it's fine.

111
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:55,920
But a lot of it, so a lot of those ideas, really, I mean, I believe have an inception in

112
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,080
phenomenology. I mean, they're, you know, especially in Heidegger, with Heidegger's idea of being in

113
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,400
the world, you know, which we'll get to. But it's just this idea that there's a more holistic

114
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:16,400
structure to the world and existence that we need to take into consideration when we're trying to

115
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,360
understand things about the world and trying to understand things about ourselves and maybe the

116
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:30,000
way in which we interact with the environment. And so I think phenomenology played at least

117
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,560
the role in trying and getting a lot of those ideas going for cognitive science.

118
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,880
Now, as far as neuroscience goes,

119
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,160
Anil set, I'm sure you've heard of Anil set. Yes, I have. Yep. He recently bought a

120
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,560
quite a popular science book right on the brain. And so he does a lot of work trying to

121
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,360
map the brain correlates of certain experiences. So he's trying to see, like, what's going on in

122
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,280
the brain at a given time when someone's having a particular experience. And he's trying to build

123
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:16,560
that map out. And you can't build that map if you don't have good phenomenology. Because

124
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,880
if you, if you, if you think, just think about it, if we think about it simply, as far as, okay,

125
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:32,400
let's say brain region X lights up when I have experience Y. And let's say we can, we can gather

126
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,960
all the data we want about the brain structure and we can reproduce it and map it as much as we

127
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,720
want. But if we don't have a good description of the experience, we're not going to know what

128
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:50,080
we're mapping this brain activity to. And so in order to have good correlative mapping, we have

129
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,560
to have good phenomenology. We have to have like a good description of the experience. And we have

130
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,680
to have people, the participants in the study that they're studying, trying to get this

131
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,840
correlative mapping going. They have to be familiar with the experience, not only as it is

132
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,040
experienced, but they have to understand what it is that the neuroscientists are trying to map,

133
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,320
like what experience do you want me to have? So then I can tell you what I'm having, so you can,

134
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,120
you know, mark down what's going on in my brain when I'm having that experience. And so you have

135
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,600
to have a whole lot of phenomenology going on, not only the person being the participant being

136
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,840
able to recognize the experience and being able to communicate that to the researchers, but the

137
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,480
researchers also have to have a pretty rich phenomenological description of what it is they

138
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,840
want their participants to experience. And that way they know precisely when the experience is

139
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,200
started, because you might, I mean, there might be like a very important, as far as neuroscience

140
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,120
there might be a very important spike in a particular brain region that they are trying

141
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:06,080
to map to a very specific, maybe milliseconds of an experience. And if you don't get that right,

142
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,480
it's just not going to be correct. Your description is going to be wrong and your

143
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,520
correlative mapping isn't going to mean anything, because you might have one side of it,

144
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:21,040
but you're going to be missing the other side of it.
