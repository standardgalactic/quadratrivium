1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey everyone, today I want to make the case as to why you should not live your best life

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,120
using the ideas of Jacques Lacourne, Slavoj Zizek, sprinkled in with a bit of the theology of Peter

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,040
Orleans. Now firstly, of course, let's try and understand what the thesis I'm trying to negate

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,280
here is. What do I mean by living your best life? I think the best way to make sense of this, let's

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,880
call it societal, cultural imposition is to go through podcasts that people consume and the books

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,400
people read. So if you look at contemporary culture and if you look at, let's say, kind of

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,200
consumerist, productivist, moral injunctions, if you look at, let's say, the Amazon bestseller list,

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,240
which I have opened right here. I just googled it for this video. You'll see some of the bestselling

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,440
books are in the self-help category. Books like Atomic Habits or Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,080
Life. And yes, there's some pop fiction, but there certainly are many books that are either in the

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:05,040
personal finance or the self-help category, along with the New Age self-actualization

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,760
category books, books like Eckhart Tolle, people like that. And if you look at the top podcasts,

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,640
the podcasts like Andrew Huberman's, what's it called, the Huberman Lab podcast, which is

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,560
a pretty good podcast on health and well-being, but people certainly obsess over the tips that

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,720
Andrew Huberman gives on how to optimize your life, how to optimize your brain or your physiology

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,200
and whatnot. And then of course, another example, which probably is a bit more from, even before my

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,440
time really, is the book The Secret by, what's her name, the Australian Bern, whoever, Ronda

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,160
Bern, right? So this book, just according to Wikipedia, it's sold over 30 million copies worldwide.

19
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,160
That's a lot of copies. And that certainly is a bestseller that there was a documentary about

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,560
this book. People still talk about things like the law of attraction and this kind of, I call it

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:14,000
toxic positivity, where the, it seems like in our culture, the imposition, kind of the imposition

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,200
by God himself in many ways is to live your best life, to self-actualize, to be as productive as

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,360
you can be, to be as healthy as you can be. And not only that, to also in the more of the consumerist

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,320
crass, crude sense, to have as much as you want to have, not merely in the sense of just, let's say,

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,640
material things like clothes and shoes and cars and watches or whatnot, but even experiences,

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,200
travel, experience the world. And of course, we have, you know, terms, colloquial terms like

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,320
FOMO, the fear of missing out and whatnot. And all of this comes from this deep seated imposition

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,880
that we put onto ourselves, ironically, or rather, physically, I'd say, to live your best life.

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,560
And the question is, what does that mean? Why do we always feel guilty for not living our best

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,680
life? Why do we always feel guilty for missing out, not just on things that are purely entertaining,

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,400
but even on things like self-actualization and becoming divine in some sense and becoming whole

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,240
or to use a more technical term? Why do we always have this desire for ontological wholeness?

33
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,600
One way to answer that question is through the ideas of Peter Rollins, who says that we are subjects

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,200
of the Achievement Society. Our culture is a culture of self-help and achievement. We

35
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:47,440
have to live our best lives. The kind of the imperative by God himself, even though most

36
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,840
people in modernity are so-called atheists, is to self-actualize, to live your best life.

37
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,320
And unlike in the past, the categorical imperative to use a content term or simply

38
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,760
what we are ought to do, what we should do was, you know, don't lie, don't shoot, don't murder,

39
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,400
don't commit adultery, all the, you know, typical traditional Christian virtues, let's say.

40
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,360
The categorical imperative of our times, the demands of our times, is to achieve. And that's why

41
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,400
Peter Rollins says we are subjects. We are people living in Achievement Society or Achievement

42
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,040
Culture, because that is ultimately what we're supposed to do, achieve. And if you could take

43
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,440
those ideas of achievement or living your best life, which seem a bit more metaphysical and,

44
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,640
let's say, try and make them a bit more psychoanalytical, the best way to put it is in

45
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,880
Na'a Slavu Žižek's catchphrase, which is enjoy a super ego.

46
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,040
The traditional notion of psychoanalysis is that because of some inner obstacles you internalized,

47
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,640
identified excessively, excessively with paternal or other social prohibitions, you cannot

48
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,920
set yourself free to enjoy, to pleasure is not accessible for you. It is accessible to you only

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,560
in pathological forms of feeling guilty and so on. So then the idea is psychoanalysis allows you to

50
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,080
suspend, overcome these internalized prohibitions so that it enables you to enjoy. The problem today

51
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:22,480
is that the commandment of the ruling ideologies enjoy in different ways. It can be sexual enjoyment,

52
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,800
consumption, commodity enjoyment, up to spiritual enjoyment, realize yourself, whatever. And I think

53
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,240
that the problem today is not how to get rid of your inhibitions and to be able to spontaneously

54
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,800
enjoy. The problem is how to get rid of this injunction to enjoy. Now, before I get to the

55
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,760
negation to keep fleshing this idea out, I'm going to use two books by Slavu Žižek. The first one

56
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,200
is perhaps his most, one of his most accessible books, How to Read Lacan, and the second one is

57
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,120
certainly one of his hardest books to read for they know not what they do. Here's what he says

58
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,480
about super ego or enjoys super ego in How to Read Lacan and after I read from both these books,

59
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,960
I'll kind of explain what he means here. Žižek states, super ego is real, the cruel and insatiable

60
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,880
agency that bombards me with the impossible demands and then mocks my botched attempts to meet them.

61
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,480
The agency in whose eyes I am all the more guilty, the more I try to suppress my sinful

62
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,560
strivings and meet its demands. The cynical old Stalinist motto about the accused at show trials

63
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,600
who profess their innocence, the more innocent they are, the more they deserve to be shot,

64
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,360
is super ego at its purest. For Lacan, super ego has nothing to do with moral conscience as far as

65
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,240
its most obligatory demands are concerned. Super ego is, on the contrary, the anti-ethical agency,

66
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,160
the segmentation of my ethical betrayal. So that except I read is a very, I call that summarized

67
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,600
or called down version of a very perspicacious idea that Žižek has been writing about ever

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,960
ever since he's been writing really. The idea that the Lacanian super ego, at least in modernity

69
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,160
in our culture, is quite different to what we would, let's say, conventionally think about the

70
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,440
Freudian super ego, where generally if you ask from any person who has any idea of who Freud is

71
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,760
and you bring up the concept of the super ego, let's say the super ego is this ethical agency,

72
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,440
kind of like the, again, the Kantian categorical imperative that talks about, you know, don't

73
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,520
lie, don't cheat, be a good person, carry out your civic duties, whatnot. Although our culture,

74
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:41,200
things have shifted. Our super ego is the imperative, as I said many times already, to in fact be

75
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:48,800
anti-ethical. In fact, to not in a hedonistic sense, to an indulge, indulge, indulge, but rather

76
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,720
it's to the demand itself is to live your best life, as I said in this video. And ironically,

77
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,040
a part of living your best life is certainly being anti-ethical and doing things that are

78
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,320
moral transgressions, so to speak. But also, again, the new age of self actualization and whatnot.

79
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,680
But then comes the important point where he makes the cynical Stalinist joke that

80
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,800
the reality of the super ego demands are that they can never be met. And in fact, the more we

81
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,400
carry them out, the guiltier we feel, the more we engage in self help, the more we engage in

82
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,200
productivity, reading all these books and listening to all these podcasts or the other

83
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,880
side of things, the more consumerist we become, the more we try to experience new things and

84
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:40,080
constantly pursue novelty, the less emptier and more guilty we feel in the sense that we always

85
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,760
feel we aren't doing enough. And that's the cruel, sadistic nature of the super ego. So that idea

86
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,480
of the super ego demands being unfulfillable brings us to an excerpt from this book for they

87
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,400
know what they do, where initially, before I read the excerpt, Gizek states that as we probably all

88
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:03,280
kind of intuit at least, we all kind of feel it that in post-modern culture, we have no

89
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:11,920
moral laws to say. We have no substructure that guides us in how traditional societies did guide

90
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,000
us in the sense that most people are atheistic, we have no metaphysical principles, and we don't

91
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,800
have a lot of prohibitions. Now, of course, the naive way to view that is we think, oh, that means

92
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,480
we can live in infinite bliss and freedom. There isn't all these old patriarchal ways of existence,

93
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,440
we could just be free. It's not so simple. Here's what Gizek states. He states, how do we

94
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,040
account for this paradox that the absence of law universalizes prohibition? There's only one possible

95
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:52,560
explanation. Enjoyment itself, which we experience as transgression, is in its innermost status something

96
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,360
imposed, ordered, when we enjoy. We never do it spontaneously. We always follow a certain injunction.

97
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,240
The psychoanalytical name for this obscene injunction, for this obscene call, enjoy your super ego.

98
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,360
So here's where all the ideas connect. In the past, the universal law, the Kantian categorical

99
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:21,040
imperative, was prohibition. Do not do this. Whereas now, in our post-modern culture, it is

100
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,960
you ought to do this. You must do this. You should do this. You must read this many self-help books.

101
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,720
You must listen to all these productivity podcasts. You must take care of your health.

102
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,920
You must focus solely on your well-being and on your health. You must have this much money. You

103
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,280
must own this thing. You must have this experience, so on and so on. You get the point. And of course,

104
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,040
that begs the question, if the current imperative, and we can't detach ourselves from these imperatives

105
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,280
there, there, regardless of whether we like them or not, how do we live our best life? Unfortunately,

106
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,200
here's where things get a bit dark. It's impossible. It's primarily due to reasons,

107
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,880
because firstly, we don't really want to live our best life. What we want to do is to fantasize

108
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,560
about living our best life, but never really live it. You have a serious ideological deviation at the

109
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,800
very beginning of famous proclamation of independence, you know, pursuit of happiness.

110
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:24,480
If there is a point in psychoanalysis, it is that people do not really want or desire happiness.

111
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,000
And I think it's good that it is like that. For example, let's be serious. When you are in a

112
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,160
creative endeavor in that wonderful fever, my God, I'm on to somethings and so on, happiness

113
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,680
doesn't enter it. You are ready to suffer. Sometimes scientists, I read history of quantum

114
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,600
physics or earlier of radiation, were even ready to take into account the possibility that they will

115
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,040
die because of some radiation and so on. You know, happiness is for me an unethical category.

116
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:03,040
And also, we don't really want to get what we think that we want. The classical story that I like,

117
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,200
the traditional Meyshovinist scenario. I am married to a wife, relations with her are cold,

118
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,240
and I have a mistress. And all the time, I dream, oh my God, if my wife were to disappear,

119
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,800
I'm not a murderer. But let us say, drop me, it would open up new life for me with the mistress.

120
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,840
You know what? Every psychoanalyst will tell you quite often happens that then, for some reason,

121
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,800
wife goes away, you lose the mistress also. You thought, this is all I want. When you have it there,

122
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,200
you turn out that it was a much more complex situation where what you want is not really to

123
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,520
live with the mistress, but to keep her as a distance, as an object of desire about which

124
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,880
you dream. And this is not just an excessive situation. I claim that this is how things

125
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,800
function. We don't really want what we think we desire. And of course, manifest and consumerism,

126
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,760
as we all know, the more we shop, the more we buy things and purchase things, the more we want to

127
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,600
shop and buy and purchase things. What we are really looking for is in that case, not a particular

128
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,080
consumable item, not a particular commodity, but rather at a fundamental ontological level,

129
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,680
what we desire is the object, this virtual void that isn't there. But perhaps even more

130
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,520
pertinently to our times, leaving consumerism aside, because it seems rather obvious, it is also

131
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,680
the fact that we never do really want our desire to be ever met. Despite the fact that it's

132
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,760
unfulfillable, regardless, what we want to do is fantasize about this object, about getting

133
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,160
whatever this virtual category is, this empty virtual category is. And perhaps the quintessential

134
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,240
example is something like Paris syndrome, where as we all know, it's a phenomenon where many,

135
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:58,240
many people, many, many tourists, whoever, they always fantasize about Paris. And once they do

136
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,520
go to Paris, once they do go to France, they see that it's just the brutal reality of what it is

137
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:09,040
and they see that it's just another stupid country. Of course, what they really were fantasizing about

138
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,600
wasn't Paris the actual material place, rather the object. And I think Gizek puts it best

139
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,080
where he says that, if there's anything psychoanalysis has told us, that is that human beings

140
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,520
fundamentally don't want to be happy or don't want their desires to be met. So to keep expanding

141
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,760
on this idea a bit more theoretically, Todd McGovern elucidates it really well in his book,

142
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,680
Capitalism and Desire, he states, capitalism is the effect of sustaining subjects in a constant

143
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,360
state of desire. As subjects of capitalism, we are constantly on the edge of having our desire

144
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,000
realized, but never reached the point of realization. This has the effect of producing a satisfaction

145
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,640
that we don't recognize as such, that is, capitalist subjects experience satisfaction itself as

146
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:01,120
dissatisfying, which enables them to simultaneously enjoy themselves and believe wholeheartedly

147
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,200
that a more complete satisfaction exists just around the corner embodied in the newest commodity.

148
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,280
So of course, when McGovern talks about capitalism, he's also talking about the

149
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,560
capitalist ideology, which is the kind of the culture that I'm talking about of living your best

150
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,160
life. And I'm sorry to quote myself here, but a little commentary on what Todd McGovern wrote.

151
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,640
Here's what I wrote. And again, I'm sorry for narcissistically quoting myself.

152
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,320
Since our lack is unfulfillable and our desire is unmeetable, we are the perfect subjects for

153
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,400
capitalist dynamics because paradoxically, capitalism works by not working. We are always

154
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,800
kept on the edge of having our desires met by, in fact, not having them ever met in reality.

155
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,160
So you could replace the word capitalism with new age, with self-help, and the idea would still

156
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,000
apply. And then we come to the other concept, which is perhaps one of Lacan's deepest ideas,

157
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,400
where he famously said, desire full stop is always the desire of the other, which basically means

158
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,920
that we are always asking the other what he desires. And this is where Jujak states in his book,

159
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,640
but even in the video I just showed you, that our desires, what we are supposed to do,

160
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,160
living your best life, whatever it may be, don't come in any authentic, spontaneous sense.

161
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,680
It always comes by the other, which is our sociosymbolic reality of culture, of society,

162
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,760
and it manifests in many ways. It's true, of course, the very conspicuous marketing

163
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:41,680
of celebrity culture, but even in more subtle ways, where it could be completely unconscious.

164
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Nonetheless, our desires are always coming to us from society.

165
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,440
Okay, so it seems like using these Lacanian ideas of psychoanalysis and Jujak's ideas of

166
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,520
more cultural analysis, we seem to be in quite a dilemma, given the fact that, firstly,

167
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,640
our super ego demands of living your best life can never be met, and the more you try,

168
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,560
the guiltier you will feel. And secondly, the fact that you realize that your desire is not

169
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,520
some authentic desire of you, of you wanting to live your best life is never what you truly want,

170
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,360
but rather it's what society is telling you to want. We seem to be stuck in a rather catch-22.

171
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,080
What do we do? What's the solution here? Now, the purpose of this video, like all my videos,

172
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,960
is never to give any easy solutions, nor is it to ever, ever, absolutely not give advice,

173
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,120
because what the hell do I know? But, at least to end the video on a high note and not in a kind

174
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:46,480
of cynical, defeatist note, I could talk about a few things that Peter Rollins introduces to

175
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,520
this conversation. He too was, in fact, influenced heavily by Lacan and Jujak, but his kind of

176
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,600
theological understanding of what we can do, given that we, in many ways, need to try and

177
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,280
liberate ourselves from this culture of self-help and productivity and living your best life.

178
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,360
But before that, before talking about certain things we could do living amidst such a culture

179
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,960
and such a social reality, there's a caveat, a very important caveat that I need to put forward,

180
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,560
which is you cannot step outside of ideology. Now, I've spoken about ideology quite a lot in

181
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,400
this video, and especially post-modern capitalist ideology. Now, we could all think the way the

182
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,000
andrate people think, oh, that means now that I know all these things, I could just step outside

183
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,480
of ideology and get red-pilled and wake up to the truth. This is to quote Lacan himself,

184
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,600
le nom d'oeuvre air, which means those who are not d'oeuvre air most. To think that you can step

185
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,520
out of ideology is the most ideological thing you could do. So, whenever someone tells you,

186
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,320
here's the reality of our world, here's consumerism, here's all the problems we're facing,

187
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,960
come to me, I'll give you the solution that is instantly ideology suspect, because the solution

188
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,320
itself is a ideological reality, because we can never step outside of ideology. This is perhaps

189
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,160
one of JJ's most original and perspicacious points that the only way to live in such a reality

190
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,840
is to understand that ideology itself is our sociosymbolic reality that gives meaning to our

191
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:26,640
lives. So, the only way to live in such a reality is to critique ideology from within,

192
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,960
not to think that you can step outside of ideology and to make this argument a bit more

193
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,000
metaphysical in the very famous Plato's Cave example. The idea is not that you could step

194
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,600
outside of the cave and then see a reality, rather, reality itself presents itself to you

195
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,720
through the cave, and the way you understand reality is through critique of ideology, in this

196
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,200
case, critique of our social reality. So, with that caveat out of the way, here's one thing

197
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,640
Peter Rowland suggests. It is the idea of grace. It's a very Christian concept, of course, and

198
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,720
in such a culture, in such a culture of self-help, such a culture of obsession with living your

199
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:12,480
best life. One thing we can struggle to do is, in fact, understand how grace works. Grace is a

200
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,840
unearned love, and now you might think that, oh, unearned love, it's great, God's grace,

201
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,560
it's fantastic, but no, it's not just saying there's some abstract God out there loving me,

202
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,000
but rather learning in your social reality that you have the ability, the space, the freedom,

203
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:35,040
whatever you may call it, to accept love, to accept love from your friends, from your family,

204
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:44,400
and if you believe in God, from God himself, that it's okay to not fall into achievement society

205
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,120
and just simply, and to use a very, very cliche term, be the stupid, dumb self you are,

206
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,840
and still find love in this world. Find love in however way it may manifest, and this is, in fact,

207
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,560
what the radical notion of grace is, because grace, Christian grace particularly, is unearned love,

208
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,120
and you might think, oh, again, as I said before, that it's fine, I can enjoy unearned love, but no,

209
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:17,440
keep in mind that in our post-modern society, with all the super ego imperatives of achieving,

210
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:26,000
of doing the best, of getting to the top, of being your best self, receiving anything unearned

211
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,040
is a traumatic, even traumatic experience. It is something we struggle a lot to feel

212
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,640
loved in this world and to accept love, but if we learn, and that's really important, if we learn

213
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:46,560
how to accept love and to accept grace, I believe to a certain extent, this can help us to live within

214
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,960
such an ideological society with our current moral impositions and super ego imperatives.

215
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,400
And the second thing is, as much as we learn to receive love, we also learn to give love,

216
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,560
and to love others. Now, there are two ways I would put this. I could say, oh, of course,

217
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,760
it comes in interpersonal relations, romantic love, loving your friends, loving your family,

218
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,360
but I also think, and perhaps it is quite important, given as Aristotle said,

219
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,160
we are political animals, and he meant that more in the sense that we are social animals in a

220
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,360
social reality, not in this day to day silly, the spectacle of politics, they didn't mean that at

221
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,080
all. Given that we are a part of society as much as society is out there, it's also within us,

222
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:38,400
it's learning to understand that it's important to have a vocation, it's important to have an

223
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,040
existential project in life, whatever it may be, you could be a writer, you could be a political

224
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,680
activist, you could be a scientist, an engineer, an entrepreneur, whatever it may be, it has to be

225
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,960
something that's an existential project, not something silly like a careerism or making money,

226
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,440
not playing the rat race and falling into the game of capitalism, certainly not, but rather

227
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,280
understanding that what you do in this world matters, not only to yourself, but also to others.

228
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,240
And I think that in some sense, liberates us from this kind of narcissistic obsession to live your

229
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,800
best life and to always sub-actualize. So yeah, that's at least for me what's helped me to understand

230
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,760
that I don't have to live my best life, I could be the shitty stupid person I am, but at the same

231
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,080
time, learn to love, learn to accept love, but also to find a vocation and to commit myself to that

232
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,880
cause, to that vocation, and in fact to go all the way, not to live this kind of tepid life of

233
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,240
oh, I've got to meditate five hours a day, have my cold shower, exercise, take all my vitamins and

234
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,640
live this perfect, balanced, holistic life, none of that, none of that, to understand that

235
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,400
existence itself has an antagonism and chaos to it, and that despite that, despite that chaos,

236
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:02,080
or perhaps through it, I will learn to partake in my vocation, partake in my existential project,

237
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,400
while also understanding that the ultimate guiding principle, the impetus behind all of it,

238
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:15,360
is love, and that is why I would say Christian theology, the Christian idea of grace, certainly,

239
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,840
I would say, is perhaps most important for our culture than any other culture,

240
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,440
when I mean our culture, I mean neoliberal capitalist culture in the times we live in.
