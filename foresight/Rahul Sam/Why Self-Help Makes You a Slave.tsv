0	5680	Firstly, I would say, in my view, self-help is a post-modern phenomenon, and what I mean
5680	12560	by that is that, which is perhaps why that self-help, as you said, Joanne, it doesn't
12560	18320	really have, it doesn't question the odds, it doesn't question what's driving us towards
18320	26400	the point B, from A to B. So it's purely focused on the systems. It's like a ruthless pragmatism.
26400	31520	It's just get it done. This is how you get it done. Apply these frameworks. James
31520	40800	Clears Atomic Habits or whatnot. My critique of self-help comes in two ways. Firstly, in a more
40800	46880	existential sense, and then afterwards, certainly my political critique, where I critique the ideology
46880	55280	of self-help. So the existential one is rather interesting because here's what I put it this
55280	61040	way. So as you were talking, it reminded me of Camus's quote from the shoot, The Fool. He says,
63040	69200	sorry, a man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of
69200	75440	the life are devoted to the earning of that money. Happiness is forgotten. The means are taken for
75440	82720	the end. So I'll just replace money with self-help there. It'll go like this then. A man wants to
82800	89600	practice self-help in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of the life are devoted
89600	97600	to the earnings of that money or to the practice of self-help. Happiness is forgotten. The means
97600	103680	are taken for the end. Now, happiness is forgotten. Again, happiness is not a big deal here, but let's
103680	108800	assume in the context of this quote, the happiness is an ought. I ought to be happy. It's the B,
108800	115680	the person's moving towards. So within this, though, what I've seen with self-help is that
115680	123600	essentially speaking, the means are taken, the means replace the end. The means don't become
124320	130160	just a means to an end. They become the end in themselves. So what happens is when people get
130160	136960	obsessed with self-help, all their life, all their life, all they do is try to optimize everything.
137520	145120	They try to meditate, run cold showers, read myriad self-help books. In fact, I saw this
145120	150400	really interesting statistic. I can't pull it up now because I got to find it, but it said that
150400	156000	majority of people who buy, so majority of people that buy self-help commodities, so except for
156000	161920	products, whatever, courses, books, all that, they're generally a really high number, like 80
161920	166320	or 90% of it, they're recurring customers. It's the same people that keep buying this stuff.
166960	172320	Because what happens is, I think people get to use a Lacanian term, a sense of Jewish zones,
172320	179360	from just the act of engaging in self-help. I'm going to read 10 self-help books despite all of
179360	183440	them virtually saying the same thing. It's not that advanced. It's just basic stuff. You don't
183440	188320	have to be a genius to have habits, be disciplined, have some framework, have a calendar, have a to-do
188320	194480	list. I mean, no shit Sherlock. You don't have to be a genius to know that. But then people get,
195280	200000	like, you know, what's this, Tiago 40 is a second brain thing where you optimize everything's
200000	206320	productive. From the processes itself, people find a great sense of pleasure, although I would use a
206320	215120	more psychoanalytical term, Jewish zones, where then there's no real, they really aren't really
215120	220320	doing anything apart from optimizing their lives, apart from self-helping, you know, and that that
220320	224480	becomes a whole lot. And it's kind of a sad existence if you think about it, because like,
224480	229840	there's no creative outlet. There's nothing, there's no creation per se. It's just this like very,
229840	236960	in a peculiar sense, narcissistic obsession with the self. And my question, the way I like
236960	241280	always think is like, I like to think of, for humans, you know, I'm a Hegelian, so we're historical
241280	250720	beings, right? Imagine if Napoleon or Churchill spent, you know, six, seven hours a day focused on
250720	256160	self-help. Like imagine Napoleon before he went to, you know, was trying to beat the Nazis, woke up
256160	261120	in the morning, meditated, you know, had the cold shower and did all these things. We would probably
261120	264960	all be speaking German and you and I probably wouldn't even be born. We've probably been some,
264960	268640	our parents would have died in some concentration. One would imagine Napoleon to have been more
268640	274480	effective, but I don't think that would be the case. You would have not stopped reading.
274480	280240	Yeah, you see a self-help ideologue would say, oh, if Napoleon or if Churchill did all these
280240	284960	optimization things, they would be even better at that, whatever they did as leaders, let's say.
284960	292640	I disagree. I think the greatness that doesn't come from this very little tweaks, optimization
292640	297040	here and there. It comes from something even beyond what you can articulate. It comes from
297040	303440	to the ancient term from trying to be that ubermunch, you know. So it comes from, in some sense,
303440	307760	the greatness comes from some kind of insanity. There's like a sense of insanity to what they're
307760	316240	doing and self-help ruins all of that. It makes you a very tepid vanilla kind of person and that's
316240	320800	why I'm going to be totally honest, man. Most people I talk to who are hyper obsessed with
320800	325680	self-help and I used to be one of these people. So I kind of know a few people who I used to be
325680	330480	a part of a pyramid scheme at MLM. Unfortunately, I got sucked in as a kid. So I still know a few
330480	334960	people who are in that circle. Great people, lovely people. We all do. We all do. Yeah,
334960	339600	everyone did a part of Amway, right? It's just like, I think Bill Clinton was a part of Amway.
339600	345200	So anyway, lovely people, but man, they're so boring. All they do is obsess over like,
345200	350240	focus on your dreams, your goals. I think the interesting thing is they're very,
350240	353680	you can say they're boring, but they're also very obnoxious in a very interesting way.
353760	358240	Oh, I mean, look, okay, I can't speak for being obnoxious because I'm an obnoxious guy.
358240	362800	No, that's true. That's true. I tend to be this. I tend to be on the top of my head.
362800	368560	Okay, so maybe just what I wanted to mention earlier as well, and you will tie here, it's like
370080	375840	how self-help used to look like was morals, right? It's a lot of morals and ethics,
375840	382240	but then there wasn't the end alone. I would say it's frenesis to use a term by Aristotle.
382240	388320	Frenesis is kind of this like pragmatic wisdom. Very sort of easy system. Frenesis,
388320	394320	which is like a very interesting. I haven't heard of that one. It's like how to engage in the world
394320	400560	as a virtuous person. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. And I think that's D,
401280	405040	like it's along the lines of how to look it up to self. It's virtue, right? But it's actually,
405040	409120	that's like, in that case, it's not the means becoming the ends. Like I think the means are
409200	414720	still the means and the ends are still the ends, right? Like when you look at it, people in ancient
414720	421600	times, like you, there's no way to parade that you're someone who's, you know, someone who's
421600	425360	thought about all of these things and someone who does all of these routines on the side,
425360	428720	because they're actually operating things. Well, you can only embody it really. I mean,
428720	433600	the only way to be a virtuous person is to embody it. Exactly.
433600	438400	As in the surfer, people can vary. I mean, we all do this. I do this with philosophy, for instance.
439120	444320	It's to use a term by Judith Butler, performativity. Be sure that, look at me, I'm doing all these
444320	452400	things. I'm performing the role of what a self-help person would typically do, which is, yeah,
452400	458320	productivity, meditation, all of this. But then that's, it's a bit unfair to say it's just something
458320	462160	self-help people do. I think in postmodern, which is why I said it's a postmodern phenomena,
462160	468320	in postmodern culture, everyone does that. We are all performing something. We are all putting
468320	474480	on a performance, because we live in this kind of groundless existence. Our being has no...
475520	480240	True. But I have one more point to make on the political side. Can I make that point? I'll let
480240	485840	you go. Is that all right? Yeah, yeah, okay. Or do you want to respond, though, to the point?
485840	488480	Actually, maybe I'll go first, because you probably take a while with that one, knowing you.
489040	493840	Oh, no, no, no. This is actually... No, I think I already... Okay. To be honest, the existential
493840	497360	point for me is the important one, because the political one, it's not just self-help.
497360	506560	I think it's given our current milieu, ideology, and many things connect to this. But I would put
506560	514240	it simply, I think self-help is also a conformist category, because it's this idea that this connects
514240	519360	to the whole therapist and all the conversations we've been having before. The idea that I'll focus
519360	523760	on myself, don't critique society, the Jordan Peterson thing, clean your room before you criticize
523760	529680	the world, focus on myself, focus on improving, focus on my immediate life, getting my finances
529680	534080	in order, getting my personal life, my personal, whatever health, wealth, whatever in order,
534080	539920	spiritual life, whatever you may call it, and don't critique structures, don't be critical of
539920	547440	neoliberalism, the capitalism, whatnot. So it's the moment one steps into the ideology of self-help,
547440	553920	you already taken on many ideological... There's a lot of ideological baggage that comes along with
553920	558960	it. It's not... So self-help certainly is not a political thing. It's not something that just
558960	563600	exists, again, independently. This is within our culture. So which is why that... Again,
563600	569040	the funny thing is that existentialist critique, I think it perfectly connects to the political
569040	576400	critique, because the existential... Essentially, when you replace the means, when the means become
576400	582400	the end, then there's no real end, right? Because it's a postmodern phenomena. The end of... Let's
582400	586560	say, again, we want to create a more just society. We want to create a society where there are less
586560	590160	people suffering, where we want to create a society where there's more love, let's say. We want to
590160	595440	create a society which is perhaps a lot more like what Christ taught us. Now those things matter,
595440	600080	because the end is already there. The end is engaging in the self-help things and not critique
600080	606240	society. So then there's no... It's like this very kind of like... Yeah, it's a slave category.
606240	612480	It's like this tepid existence where you never question society. You kind of live this zombie
612480	617920	existence in many ways, which is really interesting, because if you look at people who are engaging
617920	622400	self-help, you're right. They are rather obnoxious. You think that, man, they're people who are getting
622400	628000	things done. They're so productive. But no, sometimes you should step back and question why
628000	633600	you're doing what you're doing. Doing... Just do it the way Nike says it itself is a
633600	639600	ideological imposition. It's an injunction. Do what? Do what? Do what, man? But that's why
639600	647040	I think they're both... There are many existential drawbacks, but certainly there are many political
648240	651600	drawbacks of self-help pissing, the ideology of self-help.
