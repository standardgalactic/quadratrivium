0	12000	Okay, so I got a big boat in the middle of work and I was taking a coffee break and I decided to waste my time on social media as we all do these days.
12000	27000	And I came across that meme, the meme on how a horn becomes a Christian through vulgar atheism and reading Lacune and then Hegelianism and then understanding what the Holy Spirit encompasses in a very materialist sense.
27000	38000	And then I put that quote or it reminded me of Salvo Zizek's famous quote that the only way to become an atheist is via Christianity.
38000	47000	This is why I claim that the only way really to be an atheist is to go through Christianity.
47000	62000	Christianity is much more atheist than the usual atheism, which can claim there is no God and so on, but nonetheless it retains a certain trust into the big other.
62000	67000	This big other can be called natural necessity, evolution or whatever.
67000	76000	We humans are nonetheless reduced to a position within a harmonious whole of evolution, whatever.
76000	86000	But the difficult thing to accept is again that there is no big other, no point of reference which guarantees meaning.
86000	96000	Now what does that mean? What the hell does that mean? How can you say the way to become an atheist is via a theistic faith like Christianity?
96000	102000	Zizek essentially gets his idea for those that don't know who Zizek is.
102000	109000	He's a Slovenian philosopher inspired by the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacune and Hegel of course.
109000	123000	Alright, back to it. So Zizek gets his idea from G.K. Chesterton, his book Orthodoxy, and then Hegel's idea of how the spirit has to other itself to find itself.
123000	132000	Now that sounds just bizarrely abstract and nonsensical, so I'm not going to get too much into his Hegelian reading of Christianity.
132000	144000	However, he is inspired by Chesterton where Chesterton has an insight where he says in the crucifixion, so when Christ gets crucified, as most of us know,
144000	149000	Christ goes, right before he gets crucified, Christ goes,
149000	159000	Elah Elah Lamasabhaktami, father, father, why have thou forsaken me? What's that message? Father, father, why have thou forsaken me?
159000	175000	And the reading of Chesterton, Zizek, and some other death of God theologians is that this highlights a bizarre paradox in Christianity where Christ, who we're told is God embodied,
175000	184000	is God Himself in some way, becomes an atheist because Christ Himself stops believing in the divine.
184000	202000	Now another way of thinking about that is that Christ Himself at that moment sees that there's no big other or that there's no God the way we perceive God to rely on for grace, salvation, whatever you may call it.
202000	213000	And that's what Zizek says that the only way to really become an atheist is to understand it through this lens of our subjective destitute where we see that there's no God.
213000	227000	So does this mean that Christianity is an atheistic religion? Both yes and no, that's my take on it because I also do believe and here's where I bring in the theology of a contemporary thinker,
227000	244000	Peter Rowlands, the Irish steel ocean, that the crucifixion is indicative of how the way we understand God in contemporary society is as a being or something that we worship.
244000	247000	But all of that is adulterous.
247000	260000	They aren't reflections of what God is, but they're just idols that we worship. It's very common to see when we go to church, there's an altar call, people are told, come to Christ, you'll be saved.
260000	267000	My take is that Christ doesn't save you in the sense that we are told in contemporary religion.
267000	280000	But the best way to view the take in the crucifixion is that it's as if the only way to know God is by defining what God is not.
280000	290000	Because every time we define God in any kind of substantial positive sense, that's an idolatry, that's an idol of God.
290000	306000	So that's Peter Rowlands' take. So the way we connect this to that initial point by Zizek, that the only way to become an atheist is via Christianity, is that to also say the only way to become a Christian is via atheism,
306000	319000	because what atheism rejects is this God as a patriarchal father or God as a being, the kind of the God that the new atheists like Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris attacks.
319000	327000	However, if we take a more mystical reading of someone like Meister Eckhart, their understanding of God is a lot more different.
327000	332000	Their understanding of God is as a being that encompasses non-being itself.
332000	341000	And in many ways, God is viewed as a void, at least existentially a signifier of something that's not there.
342000	350000	Okay, I may have completely confused a lot of people by bringing and pulling all these ideas together, but look, that is what it is.
350000	352000	Go read some books.
352000	366000	Though, though, though, what's interesting again to reiterate the initial point by Zizek's reading of Chesterton is that one has to understand that atheism is not opposed to Christianity.
366000	381000	Atheism is a part of Christianity, because Christ himself, the figurehead of Christianity, had a moment where he became an atheist in the sense that he stopped believing in the transcendent divine,
381000	387000	and he saw that there's no salvation in the sense that we're told in contemporary society.
387000	398000	But also that if one becomes a Christian in the way we are told, you know, you go to church and you pray and God saves you, that is not God that's saving you.
398000	399000	That's an idol of God.
399000	401000	That's not really what God is.
401000	408000	God can't be explained in a sense of some kind of being out there that comes and helps you.
408000	415000	Rather, the best way to approach God is by what or who God is not.
415000	419000	So it's kind of a negative theology.
419000	421000	Okay, I'm going to get back to work.
421000	423000	That's enough.
