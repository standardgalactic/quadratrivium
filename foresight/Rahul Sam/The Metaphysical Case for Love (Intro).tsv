0	6000	Hey everyone, welcome to the reading of my essay, The Metaphysical Case for Love. Now in this video
6000	11520	I'll only be reading the introduction because the whole essay is 15,000 words long, therefore
11520	17200	I'll probably read it in parts and upload it as a video series, but today we're gonna start off
17200	24160	with the introduction. Here goes, The Metaphysical Case for Love. Love has to be rescued from the
24160	30960	love industrial complex. The following is the third of my tripartite essay series on love,
30960	35360	why it matters and the dire need for love's reinvention. I'll leave the links for part
35360	40880	one and two in the description down below, and this is the most philosophically dense piece
40880	48240	in the series, so risk yourself. Our culture endlessly speaks of dating, yet rarely of love.
48240	52560	Partly the reason is the death of sincerity and our overall apathy towards life,
52560	58880	expected in a culture void of metaphysical foundations. Most of us live innocuously,
58880	63840	as the saying goes, we approach life by not touching it with a 10-foot pole.
64640	71360	As is the time of nomadism, where cosmic couchsurfers seldom do we commit to anything or anyone,
72000	77360	be it a political struggle, one's family, or a passionate romance. We'd prefer,
77360	83760	quote-unquote, my freedom over being bothered by the messiness of an engaged and old consuming life.
84800	90720	But, as Marxists understood, the freedom we speak of is a pseudo-freedom to sell our labor,
90720	97360	succumb to the demands of the market economy and be a consumer. That is, the freedom to be a slave
97360	104480	to capitalism. Footnote, consumerism acts by creating false needs in us, the subjects.
104480	109840	They aren't genuine needs that satisfy us but are imposed by our society, or life world.
110640	117200	When you succumb to ideological demands and strive to fulfill these needs, you realize they are
117200	123040	unfulfillable. Nonetheless, you will keep desiring more, consequently loosing your freedom.
123920	129680	For more context, read Chapter 1 of Herbert MacCousa's One-Dimensional Man, and watch this video
129680	135520	by Julian de Medeiros explaining Gisex's theory of Coca-Cola, which I'll link down below, and
135520	141440	footnote. Love also is difficult to speak of because it only makes sense in retrospect.
142160	145120	Doesn't Soren Kerkertgaard's best known saying,
145120	151360	life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards, apply the most to love?
152240	155920	Footnote, the original quote from Kerkertgaard's journals,
156480	161760	it is really true what philosophy tells us, that life must be understood backwards.
162480	167200	But with this, one forgets the second proposition, that it must be lived forwards.
167760	174320	The proposition which, the more it is subjected to careful thought, the more it ends up concluding
174320	180000	precisely, that life at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood.
180960	185520	Exactly because there is no single moment where time stops, completely,
185520	189280	in order for me to take position to do this, going backwards.
190080	194640	End footnote, there perhaps isn't anything more unfathomable than love.
195360	200640	Falling in love is a bizarre experience, because it always hits you by surprise,
200640	205280	thus it's aptly called a fall in English or Thumbehe Meiro in French.
206160	211280	You may be casually dating someone for a while, and suddenly you realize you're in love,
211280	216640	and afterwards, you attempt to rationalize and retrospectively give meaning to your fall.
217600	224720	If the point of love is that, despite it appearing to be predestined, the fall always comes first,
224720	232160	it's fully contingent and unplanned. Therefore, within eros, romance has no technical strategy,
232240	238880	the secret of love is that there is no secret, such as why Slavoj Rizek says the modern dating
238880	244560	approach is flawed. Start quote, the problem with online dating is that it automatically
244560	250800	involves an aspect of self-commodification or self-manipulation. When you date online,
250800	257920	you must present yourself in a certain way, putting forward certain qualities. You focus on your idea
257920	263120	of how other people should perceive you, but that's not how love functions, even at a very
263120	269360	simple level. The English term is endearing foibles, an elementary ingredient in love.
270000	276400	You can't ever fall in love with the perfect person. There must be some tiny small disturbing
276400	282160	element, and it is only through noticing this element that you can say, but in spite of that
282160	289040	perfection, I love him or her. End quote. So, self-help books, dating and relationship coaches
289040	295440	are useless in attempting to make romance a tactical game, epitomized in the self-commodification
295440	302080	done by users of dating apps. If all of poetry, literature and cinema has shown as one thing
302080	307280	since time immemorial, authentic love has no recipe to be conveniently followed.
308240	315040	Does this mean speaking of love is futile? No, because as Peter Rollins writes with a twist on
315040	321200	the famous Wittgensteinian proposition, footnote. Little bit Wittgenstein wrote,
321200	328640	what we cannot speak about, we must pass over in silence and footnote. But Peter Rollins writes,
328640	334480	that which we cannot speak of is the one thing about whom and to whom we must never stop speaking.
335440	340960	Love, not unlike God, is inexhaustible, therefore it ought to be spoken of for eternity.
342160	348640	Now more than ever, philosophers, poets, artists must tackle the subject of love.
348640	354160	It shouldn't be left to be exploited by capitalism and violated by its actors of the
354160	359920	love industrial complex. Dating coaches and apps, pop psychology and self-help books,
360640	368160	relationship podcast, pickup artists, etc. Now more than ever, philosophers, poets, artists
368160	374800	must tackle the subject of love. It shouldn't be left to be exploited by capitalism and violated
374800	381600	by its actors of the love industrial complex, e.g. dating coaches and apps, pop psychology and
381600	388640	self-help books, relationship podcast, pickup artists, etc. Abha Kamu famously wrote,
389520	396400	There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life
396400	401040	is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.
401680	407280	All the rest, whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or
407280	413360	twelve categories, comes afterwards. If I ask myself how to judge that this question is more
413360	421360	urgent than that, I reply that one judges by the actions it entails. I have never seen anyone die
421360	426960	for the ontological argument. Galileo, who held a scientific truth of great importance,
426960	432880	exerted with the greatest ease as soon as it endangered his life. In a certain sense,
432880	439280	he did right. That truth was not worth the stake. Whether the earth or the sun revolves around the
439280	445920	other is a matter of profound indifference. To tell the truth, it is a futile question.
445920	451520	On the other hand, I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living.
453520	460400	Coincidentally, since it's been a predominant reason for people committing suicide, love too
460400	463840	ought to be placed in the position of suicide as a philosophical question.
464720	470240	Can we continue? Suicide has never been dealt with except as a social phenomenon.
470880	476240	Similarly, love, in our times, is dealt with psychologically and scientifically through
476240	484320	neuroscience, neuropsychology, sociology, etc. And this mechanization of love is to our own peril.
484320	487920	A case in point is when psychologist Dr. Shannon Currie
487920	495360	testified in the spectacle of the death versus her trial. Notwithstanding her necessary role
495360	502240	in evaluating the parties for legal and judicial proceedings, she seemingly played the role of a
502240	508480	high priestess for the general public. When her truths are absolute, especially in matters of
508480	514640	romance and love. Of course, neither Currie nor anyone else explicitly states this. But what
514640	520000	matters for critical analysis is what is not said over what is formally proclaimed.
521200	528000	Society tacitly accepts what public-facing psychologists like Currie or more politically
528000	535360	Jordan Peterson says to be truths about being as such, that is ontology, the study of the fundamental
535360	541360	nature of reality. The psychologization of existence is distinctly manifest in our times.
542320	548800	So when a psychologist makes claims on love or politics, for instance, we subliminally accept
548800	554960	these as metaphysical truths. i.e. when Currie was a guest on Lex Friedman's podcast,
555760	562320	she went on to describing falling in love as being high on heroin due to the chemicals pumping in
562320	569680	your brain. Since she does not stipulate her statements with, this is only a neuropsychological
569760	577040	view, we implicitly take her views to be absolute and boil down love to be a neuroscience of sorts.
578880	584960	There is no room for the unknown and no for the speculations that are allowed, or worse,
584960	590560	are considered a waste of time if they don't serve the aforementioned love-industrial complex.
591200	597920	Footnote, I'm not criticizing Dr. Shannon Currie as she doesn't need to include this caveat in
597920	604480	every public conversation. Expecting her to do so would be unreasonable. Unlike Jordan Peterson,
604480	610400	she never claims to be more than a psychologist. However, I only point out the error of our
610400	615040	cultural zeitgeist. Her case serves as an example of this phenomenon.
615840	621040	End footnote. It was Fyodor Dostoevsky who critically delineated the phenomenon of
621040	627600	psychologizing the human condition best. In the Brother's Karamazov, during Dimitri Karamazov's
627600	634560	trial, after being accused of patricide for murdering his father, Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov's
634560	641840	defendant Dimitri's attorney, Fetkovic, says he was forewarned in St. Petersburg and I quote,
641840	648480	that I shouldn't counter here as my opponent a deep and most subtle psychologist who has by this
648560	655520	quality long acquired by merit and a special reputation in our still young judicial world
656080	663280	and continues sadonically, but profound as psychology is, it's a knife that cut both ways,
663280	669200	end quote. In other words, psychology allows us to interpret the same facts in different ways
669200	675360	or in a way that suits our pre-held beliefs. Ergo, we should be wary of treating the discipline
675360	681280	as a whole form of truth because it too, like all human practices, is placed within an ideological
681280	688000	structure. During Dostoevsky's time, forensic psychology was a discipline in nascent forms
688720	695360	and he had a great interest in how it was practiced in the Russian courts. If he were alive today,
695360	702400	he'd have similar comments about the depth be her trial. He wouldn't find fault with science
702400	706960	or the practice of psychology. In fact, he'd load the findings of psychoanalysis,
707520	714160	not a Ben A. Dostoevsky heavily influenced Sigmund Freud with his theories. Yet he would be critical
714160	719680	of ego psychology, today's prevalent form practice in the western world. And being the
719680	725440	romantic Dostoevsky is, he'd find the desire to reduce the human condition to an essence
726080	733040	within the bounds of any academic discipline as an eye. The point being is, yes, love is a
733040	740240	psychological phenomenon, but it is that and much more. To love in all its beauty and terror is the
740240	747200	epitome of human existence. So if there's one thing philosophy needs to tackle, it's what love entails.
747920	753600	Or the rest, whether or not artificial general intelligence is possible, whether capitalism
753680	759920	or socialism is the viable system for our times comes afterwards. What is love is the question
759920	763600	worth asking till the end of time.
