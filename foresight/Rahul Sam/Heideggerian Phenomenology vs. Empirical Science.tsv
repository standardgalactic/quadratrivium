0	3360	I do want to say something about the way in which Heidegger
3360	6720	defines phenomenology, because I think it's a very brilliant
6720	8720	sort of description of it.
10720	17200	And so Heidegger, when he's describing phenomenology and
17200	21600	being in time, but also in the lecture course, given a few years
21600	24080	before he published being in time, and that lecture course is
24080	25600	called the History of the Concept of Time.
26320	30480	Sorry, just to clarify, so being in time is Heidegger's
30480	34400	machemopus, right? We should probably put that out. Yeah.
34400	37040	Sorry, I didn't interrupt you. Jacob, keep going. Yeah.
37040	40800	No, no, you're good. Yeah, being in time is what he's most famous for.
42800	45600	Even though, I mean, he wrote a lot. He has a lot of books. He has a lot of papers.
46400	49360	His later work differs a little bit from his early work,
49360	53120	but there's also a dispute as to how real the turn is.
55600	57680	Later Heidegger and early Heidegger, yeah.
57680	62560	Yeah, and I'm not really knowledgeable enough to comment on how
62560	65840	different those two things are. I'm kind of working my way chronologically
65840	72480	through this moment's work. But yeah, in being in time and his earlier
72480	78240	lecture course, he described phenomenology by going back to
79440	85280	the ways in which the Greeks use the term phenomenon in logos.
85280	89120	So he's kind of taking apart the term phenomenology
89120	96000	and separating it and looking to the Greek definitions of this.
96880	103920	And in the book, Heidegger says that the Greeks understood the term phenomenon
103920	110080	as, this is going to sound very obscure and esoteric, but I'm going to give,
110080	112800	hopefully, an easier to understand description afterward.
112800	118640	But he says, phenomenon is that which shows itself in itself, the manifest.
118640	120160	Typical Heidegger.
120160	126320	Yeah, and the term for the Greeks also carried connotation of bringing
126320	132960	something to life and eliminating. And then the logos, Heidegger explained,
132960	138320	the Greeks understood by the logos something like discoursing, but not just like,
138320	141840	not just dialogue and not just a verbal utterance, but
141840	147520	it's more of a discursive communication that lets something be seen.
148880	156240	And so you could think of the logos as words, whether uttered or written down
156240	162560	or what have you, that point to something, they let something be seen.
162560	167040	It's kind of bringing something to life, it's bringing the phenomenon to life.
167040	170880	And so we want to understand this in a less obscure and difficult way than
170960	177840	Heidegger likes to put things. We can say something like, the logos points to the
177840	183040	phenomenon in such a way that the phenomenon becomes un-concealed or the logos allows the
183040	187840	phenomenon to come into view by looking and out of experience in such a way that it can be seen.
187840	193360	And so really, it's almost like your words should connect with something that can be
193360	197520	pointed out in experience or can be shown in experience. And so we're not,
198480	204400	and he contrasts this with the idea of free-floating concepts and words and ideas.
205760	212240	And by that, he just means something like, we don't want to abstract away so much from experience
212960	220560	that we're just playing language games. We want our words to be able to meet up with experience
220560	226880	in such a way that if I say something, it's all like in some of my papers about meaning what
226960	231360	I'm trying to do, as I'm trying to point to experience, I'm trying to point to
231920	237840	particular experiences and particular moments in particular experiences where maybe
238880	248320	someone might find meaning. So I'm just trying to bring something into view using words and concepts.
249760	254320	I'm glad you said that, Jico, because in one of your papers, I forget which one,
254320	257920	you've sort of touched on this, but a question that came to mind was,
259120	265440	so from the definition you gave, definition of phenomenology, how does that differ from, let's
265440	272160	say, the empiricist tradition or the empiricist approach, which tends to be quite popular these
272160	277280	days, especially in the world of artificial intelligence, where we think that our epistemology
277280	284240	or our knowledge or our truths of the world is revealed purely based on empiricism, which is
284240	290480	experiencing, measuring things, and that in some sense, the mind is a blank canvas and
290480	296240	the world just gives us information and input. So from the empirical approach, how does phenomenology
296240	302080	differ? So phenomenology is going to differ in the sense that, okay, so if we think about the
302080	311040	empirical approach specifically as it pertains to the sciences, we're getting, we're trying to get a
311040	317200	collection of experiences that kind of compile and point toward the same sort of thing and experience.
319360	326400	Now, a major difference, I guess, is going to be what it is we're trying to discern in empirical
326400	330640	science, as opposed to something like Pythagoras phenomenology, the way that I just described
330720	342080	phenomenology. With a scientific and empirical approach, we're usually looking at objects and
342080	350880	we're trying to figure out what sort of properties these objects have. And so, I mean, I guess physics
350880	354720	or chemistry is a great example of that. And we're trying to see maybe what
354720	362160	how two entities interact with each other. And we're going to perform experiments to do that,
362160	368640	and we're going to try to replicate the experiments. And we're going to try to not let our first person,
368640	375520	perspective, influence exactly what we're investigating. So phenomenology is going to
375520	380000	differ from that. In that we're not, we're not collecting data and we're not measuring stuff.
380960	385760	We're experiencing, we're trying to pay attention to the experience as it's experienced. So you're
385760	393680	not going to measure your experience of meaning, say you're going to more so, if you're doing a
393680	399680	phenomenology and you're trying to discern maybe what you find meaningful, you're going to more
399680	407600	sort of reflect on maybe the way that you feel when you were participating in a certain activity.
407840	414800	And from there, you might also start to look at the structures of the experience,
415840	421040	more so than just the feeling of the experience, which might be, you know, what's involved in
421040	427520	this activity or what's involved in this experience. What are the things that are essential to the
427520	432960	experience without which I could no longer say that it was a meaningful experience? Those are the
432960	437120	sorts of things that phenomena, that sort of questions phenomenology is going to ask. And
437120	443040	specifically high digger, because specifically for high digger, he's wanting to look, he's wanting to
444640	450560	discern the a priori structures of existence and experience, which is just to say
452480	460800	a priori meaning always already there. Like what's necessary? What are the, what, what, what
460800	465600	structures are necessary for this to exist or for me to have this particular experience?
466400	469520	Yeah, I guess I'll leave it at that for now, because otherwise I'm going to get into a really
469520	473200	deep, or you can ask a clarifying question, because otherwise I'm just going to go on at the end.
473840	480800	No, that was perfect, mate. I think in many ways you, you, you lead me to my next question. I mean,
480800	486320	I thought we were going to discuss existentialism too, because obviously it's kind of like the
486320	492080	precursor, so not the precursor, but it's highly correlated to phenomenology. But perhaps since
492080	498400	we're already on this topic, you see, in some sense, I kind of regret even asking that question,
498400	505040	because I'm coming to realize that maybe it's not fair to ask questions such as, oh, what's the
506000	512720	difference? Or what's the stark difference between phenomenology and science? Because if you think
512720	519120	of a field like, let's say, psychology or cognitive science, those fields have had a massive influence
519120	528000	by thinkers like Merleau Ponty or Heidegger by phenomenologists. So, well, the question I was
528000	533360	going to ask is how does phenomenology, and I was also going to say existentialism, but we didn't
533360	538880	get to that still, but let's just say how does phenomenology differ from a more scientific
538880	545120	approach? But maybe to make things even a bit more interesting, let's talk about, in fact,
545120	549680	how does it relate to fields like psychology and cognitive science, where in the world of,
549680	554320	in the scientific approach, what we always try and do is take the, remove the subject, so remove
554320	559920	the subjective experience. But clearly, there are some fields, even within science, where you
559920	565200	can't do that, you can't remove the subject from cognitive science or psychology. So maybe to make
565200	570080	things a bit more interesting, how do they correlate, how do they connect to phenomenology,
570080	577120	those fields I mentioned? Sure, sure. So I want to comment on cognitive science just a little
577120	581520	bit first, and then I want to maybe dive into a little bit of neuroscience and how phenomenology
581520	588720	might be related, because I actually presented a paper last year at a philosophy conference
588720	593120	hosted by a university in the Czech Republic on this topic of phenomenology neuroscience. But
593200	599600	before I get to that, something that I really appreciate about cognitive science is that
601440	609440	it really embraces the subjective experience. And like you said, you can't remove that from
609440	621520	cognitive science, cognitive science, necessarily. And I think the most prevailing approach in
621520	625920	cognitive science right now is 4E cognitive science. And that's just the 440s. I always forget
625920	631920	one, but it stands for embeddedness, embodied, inactive. And I, like I said, I always forget the
631920	639040	fourth one. I don't know why, but I'll leave a little caption or whatever, just too far. It was
639040	645600	all good. Yeah. Yeah, have somebody place in the comment. Kind of take the video. Yeah, it's fine.
645760	655920	But a lot of it, so a lot of those ideas, really, I mean, I believe have an inception in
655920	662080	phenomenology. I mean, they're, you know, especially in Heidegger, with Heidegger's idea of being in
662080	668400	the world, you know, which we'll get to. But it's just this idea that there's a more holistic
668400	676400	structure to the world and existence that we need to take into consideration when we're trying to
676400	681360	understand things about the world and trying to understand things about ourselves and maybe the
681360	690000	way in which we interact with the environment. And so I think phenomenology played at least
690000	694560	the role in trying and getting a lot of those ideas going for cognitive science.
695040	698880	Now, as far as neuroscience goes,
702880	708160	Anil set, I'm sure you've heard of Anil set. Yes, I have. Yep. He recently bought a
708160	714560	quite a popular science book right on the brain. And so he does a lot of work trying to
717760	723360	map the brain correlates of certain experiences. So he's trying to see, like, what's going on in
723360	729280	the brain at a given time when someone's having a particular experience. And he's trying to build
729280	736560	that map out. And you can't build that map if you don't have good phenomenology. Because
737600	742880	if you, if you, if you think, just think about it, if we think about it simply, as far as, okay,
742880	752400	let's say brain region X lights up when I have experience Y. And let's say we can, we can gather
752480	758960	all the data we want about the brain structure and we can reproduce it and map it as much as we
758960	762720	want. But if we don't have a good description of the experience, we're not going to know what
762720	770080	we're mapping this brain activity to. And so in order to have good correlative mapping, we have
770080	774560	to have good phenomenology. We have to have like a good description of the experience. And we have
774560	779680	to have people, the participants in the study that they're studying, trying to get this
780240	785840	correlative mapping going. They have to be familiar with the experience, not only as it is
785840	791040	experienced, but they have to understand what it is that the neuroscientists are trying to map,
791040	796320	like what experience do you want me to have? So then I can tell you what I'm having, so you can,
796320	803120	you know, mark down what's going on in my brain when I'm having that experience. And so you have
803120	809600	to have a whole lot of phenomenology going on, not only the person being the participant being
809600	815840	able to recognize the experience and being able to communicate that to the researchers, but the
815840	820480	researchers also have to have a pretty rich phenomenological description of what it is they
820480	827840	want their participants to experience. And that way they know precisely when the experience is
827840	831200	started, because you might, I mean, there might be like a very important, as far as neuroscience
831680	837120	there might be a very important spike in a particular brain region that they are trying
837120	846080	to map to a very specific, maybe milliseconds of an experience. And if you don't get that right,
846080	848480	it's just not going to be correct. Your description is going to be wrong and your
848480	853520	correlative mapping isn't going to mean anything, because you might have one side of it,
853520	861040	but you're going to be missing the other side of it.
