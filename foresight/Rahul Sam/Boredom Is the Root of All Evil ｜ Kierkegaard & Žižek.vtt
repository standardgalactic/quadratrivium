00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
Hey everyone, today we're going to discuss the idea of Bodum using the existential theories of the philosopher Soren Kerkregard,

00:06.720 --> 00:13.640
and particularly on what he's delineated in his book, Eitheror, which some would argue is his magnum opus.

00:13.640 --> 00:22.240
Also, sorry about the background noise, someone's mowing their lawn, just when I decided to record a video.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.680
But firstly, let me read something from the book.

00:24.680 --> 00:29.960
So here, Kerkregard is writing as the esteem, and I'll get into what that means in a bit.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.240
He says this,

00:59.960 --> 01:06.200
By pressing the speed to the maximum, one need only say to oneself,

01:06.200 --> 01:09.400
Bodum is a root of all evil.

01:09.400 --> 01:16.040
Strange that Bodum, so still and static, should have such power to set things in motion.

01:16.040 --> 01:24.360
The effect that Bodum exercises is altogether magical, except that it is not one of attraction, but of repulsion.

01:24.360 --> 01:32.720
So firstly, starting off this section of Eitheror, you could see clearly Kerkregard's esteem is no fan of Bodum.

01:32.720 --> 01:36.600
He literally states that we're repelled by it.

01:36.600 --> 01:42.720
But it's important to understand this before we get to exploring this idea of Bodum via the lens of Kerkregard,

01:42.720 --> 01:49.000
is that this is particularly not what Kerkregard believes, and that's really important.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.800
Because this, in my opinion, is what makes Kerkregard a brilliant philosopher.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.320
You never really truly know what his beliefs are.

01:56.320 --> 02:02.160
He delineates and outlines different kinds of existential theories.

02:02.160 --> 02:12.720
And the esteem, the person who wants to live the aesthetic life, I think is in a rather uncanny way pertinent to our times.

02:12.720 --> 02:17.400
I wouldn't say uncanny is the proper word, but in a rather interesting way, pertinent to our times,

02:17.400 --> 02:21.720
because I'd postulate that in many ways, aren't we all esthetes?

02:21.720 --> 02:31.520
As in, Kerkregard's esteem is a person who constantly pursues happiness and novelty that they constantly want to be titillated.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.280
Isn't that modern society?

02:33.280 --> 02:39.680
If you think of society, and to use a term that I heard from, in fact, I'm a Ewan,

02:39.680 --> 02:45.600
society itself has this meta-aim, contemporary society, and that meta-aim tends to be happiness.

02:45.600 --> 02:49.040
So if you go to a person and ask, why do you work?

02:49.040 --> 02:50.400
You could say, I'm working for money.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.200
And then you ask, why do you want to make money?

02:52.200 --> 02:54.800
Or I'm making, I want to make money to be financially free.

02:54.800 --> 03:00.120
Or I want to, you know, for starters, most people, unfortunately, would say, I'm making money just to survive.

03:00.120 --> 03:05.040
And that's the harsh, crude reality of the world we live in.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.560
People simply want to get by.

03:06.560 --> 03:14.320
But at the same time, let's say people that are a bit more well-off, a bit more middle-class, a bit more bourgeois.

03:14.320 --> 03:18.640
If you keep questioning what the purpose of what they're doing is, at one point,

03:18.640 --> 03:19.880
what happiness comes up.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.320
I'm making money to be more happy.

03:21.320 --> 03:26.480
I'm making more money to travel the world, experience new things, have novelty.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.120
And for Kierkegaard, this is the esteem.

03:29.120 --> 03:34.040
Now, he doesn't place any moral judgment on being an esteem.

03:34.040 --> 03:42.280
It's simply, again, as I kind of touched on before, is a mode of life, an existential mode of life, a state of being.

03:42.280 --> 03:56.160
And the esteem constantly pursues the new thing, be it sex, be it women, be it flirting, be it money, be it alcohol, drugs,

03:56.160 --> 04:01.040
or on the other side, what some would call high culture, intellectual work.

04:01.040 --> 04:10.160
What I'm doing right now is, in some ways, an aesthetic act, or beauty and art, or classical music,

04:10.160 --> 04:15.120
or indulge oneself in being titillated by such things.

04:15.120 --> 04:19.720
Nevertheless, it's still taking real pleasure in the aesthetic life.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.720
And that's what the esteem is.

04:20.720 --> 04:29.640
And I think, for our times, again, to not to repeat myself, the esteem's mode of living is germane.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.720
But here's the way I bring in Zhezhek.

04:31.720 --> 04:37.280
It's not just that we are esteem because we spontaneously, deep in our covenants and authentic sense,

04:37.280 --> 04:40.040
want to be an estate, that this is the kind of aesthetic life.

04:40.040 --> 04:49.840
Rather, in many ways, the moral imperative, the injunction by society is to enjoy, to live your best life.

04:49.840 --> 05:00.000
And two ways of thinking about it is the typical kind of crude 1960s madmen style, where, oh, it's about sex, drugs, money, women.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.760
It's just being the typical consumer, making more money so it can consume more.

05:04.840 --> 05:09.680
That's the very crude way that we kind of think of how consumerism, for instance, works.

05:09.680 --> 05:17.000
Buy this thing, buy this product, and that'll fulfill your desires, that'll make you happy,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.080
and keep going to the next one, to the next one, kind of like the Jay-Z's song.

05:25.480 --> 05:33.040
But of course, the other side of the same coin is a bit more subtle, but the kind of new age aesthetic life,

05:33.080 --> 05:36.000
self-actualization, live your best life.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.280
People who obsess over self-help and productivity and mindfulness.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.680
And I hate this term because it's really overused.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.960
Well-being, well-being.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.880
You hear Sam Harris types constantly talk about it.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.400
It's important to meditate.

05:50.400 --> 05:56.360
People obsess over listening to Andrew Huberman's, optimizing your health.

05:56.360 --> 06:02.240
And then, of course, there's more of the positive psychology, which is like pop positive psychology.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.800
Focus on being your best self.

06:04.800 --> 06:11.080
And then the kind of new age, spiritualist type is divine, feminine, divine, masculine.

06:11.080 --> 06:17.800
I'm one with the universe, which, unfortunately, in other words, the two-carrier way has a strain of fascism to it, too.

06:17.800 --> 06:25.600
But all these things, all these things, the kind of crude consumerism and even the new age self-actualization,

06:25.600 --> 06:28.480
I put it all on the umbrella of character-guards aesthetic life.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.920
And if you read, so the book, either or, it's a dialectical book.

06:31.920 --> 06:41.920
If you read the either, which is on the aesthetic, you'll see so much of what character-guards writing about in the 1840s remarkably applies to our times,

06:41.920 --> 06:49.440
specifically our times, or especially our times, given the kind of stage of capitalism we are in right now.

06:49.440 --> 06:59.960
And I'm not pointing or like blaming everything on capitalism in a way I kind of am, but a lot of our culture, the way we live,

06:59.960 --> 07:06.080
it's influenced by the ideological impositions of neoliberal capitalism.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.880
I'll leave it there, but it's a bit more complicated.

07:08.880 --> 07:13.480
But I'll put it like this, and I think that's the point Ja'Jak makes.

07:13.480 --> 07:17.080
He states that the super ego imperative is to enjoy.

07:17.080 --> 07:22.160
The traditional notion of psychoanalysis is that because of some inner obstacles,

07:22.160 --> 07:28.280
you internalized, identified excessively, excessively with paternal or other social prohibitions,

07:28.280 --> 07:34.480
you cannot set yourself free to enjoy, to pleasure is not accessible for you.

07:34.480 --> 07:39.480
It is accessible to you only in pathological forms of feeling guilty and so on.

07:39.480 --> 07:49.160
So then the idea is psychoanalysis allows you to suspend, overcome these internalized prohibitions so that it enables you to enjoy.

07:49.160 --> 07:56.760
The problem today is that the commandment of the ruling ideologies enjoy in different ways.

07:56.760 --> 08:04.440
It can be sexual enjoyment, consumption, commodity enjoyment, up to spiritual enjoyment, realize yourself, whatever.

08:04.440 --> 08:13.080
And I think that the problem today is not how to get rid of your inhibitions and to be able to spontaneously enjoy.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.360
The problem is how to get rid of this injunction to enjoy.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.120
So it's because of this super ego imperative that we have to enjoy.

08:20.120 --> 08:24.040
In many ways, we are forced to be esthetes in the modern world.

08:24.040 --> 08:28.240
If we need to understand what Kedrican means about the aesthetic life,

08:28.240 --> 08:33.920
or particularly for this video, the idea of boredom and exploit via the aesthetic lens,

08:33.920 --> 08:39.440
because again, I am beating on a dead horse here, we in many ways are all esthetes.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.560
In the book, in this part of the book, he continues saying, he says,

08:42.560 --> 08:46.520
OK, the quintessential example is to think of children.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.440
We all think of children.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.520
And what happens when children are bored?

08:50.520 --> 08:52.480
They generally get up to no good.

08:52.480 --> 08:56.120
You know, we hear terms of, you know, teenage illinquency,

08:56.120 --> 09:02.800
or we see all these statistics, sociological statistics about when kids have nothing to do, they get up to no good.

09:02.800 --> 09:09.520
And he says, this is a clear indicator that being boredom is repulsive.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.440
It's not a good thing.

09:10.440 --> 09:15.080
It's in fact the root of all evil as the esthetes writes as Kedrican.

09:15.080 --> 09:20.640
I'm going to keep saying, as Kedrican writes, because it's kind of confusing to mix them together.

09:20.640 --> 09:25.040
It's kind of something fun about reading Kedrican, because you never really know

09:25.040 --> 09:32.960
which who he's writing as, because he's got so many synonyms and different ways of explaining existence.

09:32.960 --> 09:39.880
And then he goes on by saying that, oh, look, the fact that children behave in such way

09:39.880 --> 09:43.240
when they're bored is the reason that boredom is a problem.

09:43.240 --> 09:49.880
And then he states, what wounded them that the world is regressing, that evil is gaining ground more and more,

09:49.880 --> 09:54.280
since boredom is on the increase and boredom is a root of all evil.

09:54.280 --> 10:01.760
And then with the stroke of genius, I would say, Kedrican predicts this pathological obsession we all have with being productive,

10:01.760 --> 10:09.320
or with wanting to always be busy, which one would say is the ideology of productivism.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.800
So I kind of touched on this a bit before.

10:12.800 --> 10:19.600
I was talking about people like Andrew Huberman or all these, you know, the myriad self-help productivity gurus on YouTube.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.240
And again, they have a place, a certain place.

10:22.240 --> 10:27.880
But what happens is that what people apply to their lives to be more productive

10:27.880 --> 10:34.840
or to try and kind of be a bit more efficient, the part replaces the whole.

10:34.840 --> 10:35.880
That's all they become.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.960
They all become people who need to optimize everything.

10:37.960 --> 10:44.360
And it comes to a point where where everything, including things like love and family and intimacy,

10:44.360 --> 10:54.920
all these things are viewed through the lens of productivism, ticking off boxes and making the most out of the time you have in for a day.

10:54.920 --> 10:59.960
And for Kedrican, that is that is he kind of in a very sadonic way.

10:59.960 --> 11:03.760
He mocks it and he says that that is not the way we humans are.

11:03.840 --> 11:12.280
We humans, you know, are not machines and we don't have to constantly live this hyper productive, optimized life.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.360
So he's very sadonic about it.

11:15.360 --> 11:19.680
And he says something like this.

11:19.680 --> 11:26.920
There are people with an extraordinary gift for transforming everything into a business whose whole life is business.

11:26.920 --> 11:35.840
To fall in love and marry, listen to a joke and admire a work of art with the same zealous sense of affairs, which they work in the office.

11:35.840 --> 11:45.320
Isn't that so interesting because I've recently been seeing on Twitter of people posting these long Google Docs, Google Docs or long Google Docs documents.

11:45.320 --> 11:46.320
There we go.

11:46.320 --> 11:51.280
Long Google Documents with sort of like checklists on reasons to date me.

11:51.280 --> 11:58.400
So even love has become like a kind of business interaction or a business transaction.

11:58.400 --> 12:10.000
And then of course, dating apps, dating apps is perhaps in our times the quintessential example of how we commodify other people and we kind of, you know, check the boxes and see our interactions become.

12:10.000 --> 12:24.640
Yeah, again, at a very kind of a transactional level, the same way we go to the supermarket and buy, let's say, I don't know, some can of tuna and you got all these myriad options.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.720
We treat other human beings the same way.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.200
But of course, that's not how love works.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.320
Love doesn't work where you pick the best from the rest.

12:31.320 --> 12:37.400
It's rather it's in retrospect, you pick someone and then you make them the best from your own choice.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.720
Hold on to the conversation.

12:38.720 --> 12:51.400
But the point being, again, KKGOT sees how once we start living in a certain way where we repel boredom, we repel not making the best use of our time.

12:51.400 --> 13:01.400
And we think that's kind of like a sin because, again, our moral injunction or the super ego commandment is to live your best life.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.040
Then everything has to be optimized.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.600
We all have to be pathologically obsessed with being productive.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.360
And then he continues.

13:08.360 --> 13:11.640
And here's where he's being a bit sadonic, which I love.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.320
So all people are boring.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.600
The word itself indicates the possibility of a subdivision.

13:16.600 --> 13:23.160
Boring can describe a person who boasts others as well as one who boasts himself.

13:23.160 --> 13:29.920
Those who both others are the general plebians, the mass, the endless strain of humanity in general.

13:29.920 --> 13:36.200
Those who both themselves are the elect, the nobility, and how strange it is that, and I love this line,

13:36.200 --> 13:45.200
how strange it is that those who don't bow themselves usually bow others, while those who bow themselves amuse others.

13:45.200 --> 13:51.600
The people who do not bow themselves are generally those who are busy in the world, in one way or another.

13:51.600 --> 13:56.600
But that is just why they are the most boring, the most insufferable of all.

13:56.600 --> 14:00.800
And I thought that was really interesting because if you think about it, it's kind of like the argument.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.200
In fact, I've got the book right here.

14:03.200 --> 14:13.200
Makuza makes in his book One-Dimensional Man that when people become these kind of hyper-optimized, you know, productivity robots,

14:13.200 --> 14:15.200
they in fact do become very one-dimensional.

14:15.200 --> 14:26.200
All their life entails is a life of optimizing one's finances, optimizing one's time, living this very to-do-less space life.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.200
And I am guilty as charged. I happen to be one of them.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.200
In fact, I would say it's really interesting because I was with a girl for a while.

14:32.200 --> 14:41.200
I was dating a girl for a few months and probably one reason we broke up was she was the opposite of me.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.200
She was very good at relaxing and not doing anything.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.200
So I think it certainly is a bit of a personality trait too.

14:47.200 --> 14:55.200
Although I don't want to get into psychology and psychologize Kegelgaard's philosophy here, I think it's more of a cultural phenomenon where, yes,

14:55.200 --> 14:59.200
we all have this desire, this yearning to constantly be productive.

14:59.200 --> 15:06.200
And I think the point Kegelgaard makes here is that when all our life is treated like a business, as he's stated here,

15:06.200 --> 15:10.200
then we kind of lose this spirit of what it means to be human.

15:10.200 --> 15:17.200
We lose this kind of, I don't even know, in a way we stop being human.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.200
We become an automaton.

15:19.200 --> 15:25.200
And it's even an interesting Marxist critique of modern society.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.200
People like that generally seem to be quite boring.

15:28.200 --> 15:34.200
I find people who are hyper-obsessed with self-help the most boring, artificial people in the world

15:34.200 --> 15:38.200
because it seems that everything in their life is architected, it's contrived,

15:38.200 --> 15:45.200
and I find that to be, yes, as he writes, rather boring and insufferable.

15:46.200 --> 15:52.200
But seeing all that, in the middle of this section, Kegelgaard takes a bit of a turn and he states this,

15:52.200 --> 15:58.200
and afterwards I'll expand on what he means here, which at least my reading of what he's trying to state here.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.200
He states,

16:01.200 --> 16:03.200
It is usually said, is a root of all evil.

16:03.200 --> 16:06.200
To prevent this evil, one recommends work.

16:06.200 --> 16:11.200
However, it is easy to see from the remedy as well as the fear it caused,

16:11.200 --> 16:16.200
that this whole view is of very plebeian extraction.

16:16.200 --> 16:20.200
Idleness as such is by no means a root of evil.

16:20.200 --> 16:26.200
Quite the contrary, it is a truly divine way of life, so long as one is not born.

16:27.200 --> 16:31.200
Certainly, idleness may lead you to lose your fortune and so on,

16:31.200 --> 16:35.200
but of such things, the man of noble nature has no fear.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.200
What he fears is boredom.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.200
The Olympian gods were not bored.

16:40.200 --> 16:46.200
They pondered in happy idleness, oh sorry, they prospered in happy idleness.

16:46.200 --> 16:53.200
A beauty who neither soothes nor spends, nor irons nor reads, nor makes music as happy in her idleness,

16:53.200 --> 16:55.200
for she is not bored.

16:55.200 --> 17:01.200
So far from idleness being the root of all evil, rather it is the true good.

17:01.200 --> 17:06.200
The root of all evil is boredom, and that is what must be kept at bay.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.200
Idleness is not evil.

17:08.200 --> 17:12.200
Indeed, one can say that any human who lacks appreciation of it,

17:12.200 --> 17:15.200
proves that he has not raised himself to the level of humanity.

17:15.200 --> 17:20.200
So at last line, I kind of was kind of what I was trying to articulate,

17:20.200 --> 17:25.200
that in many ways, becoming this kind of one-dimensional person,

17:25.200 --> 17:28.200
you lose a part of what it means to be human,

17:28.200 --> 17:33.200
or you don't raise yourself to the level of humanity one could add.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.200
Okay, so in the paragraph I read, what's Krikgad saying?

17:36.200 --> 17:40.200
My reading is that, of course, as even Bertrand Russell,

17:40.200 --> 17:44.200
who probably comes from a very different tradition, more of the analytical tradition states,

17:44.200 --> 17:46.200
idleness is not a bad thing.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.200
Idleness, in fact, is a good thing to be human.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.200
We humans need a bit of idle time.

17:51.200 --> 17:56.200
As perhaps Nietzsche said, old great ideas come to us when we are walking in walks.

17:56.200 --> 18:01.200
So we need time that is just time spent without any, it's purposeless time.

18:01.200 --> 18:07.200
It's time not, it's not resting so you could recuperate and do more work.

18:07.200 --> 18:12.200
It's rather the subtle art of nothingness, of idleness.

18:12.200 --> 18:17.200
And in fact, in modern society, as I've touched on, we simply don't have to be idle.

18:17.200 --> 18:22.200
We simply don't have time to be idle anymore, although we are essentially both.

18:22.200 --> 18:26.200
Now, I'll explain what I mean by essentially both a bit later,

18:26.200 --> 18:31.200
because as we read this section, what you see is Krikgad delineates

18:31.200 --> 18:35.200
that boredom is an ontological category.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.200
It's intrinsic to being human.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.200
We can't get rid of it.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.200
We can't jettison it from our existence.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.200
And that's the problem.

18:43.200 --> 18:49.200
The problem is that since boredom, despite as he states, or the esteemed states,

18:49.200 --> 18:55.200
is the root of all evil, despite that it still is a part of who we are.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.200
We, in a very fundamental sense, are bored.

18:58.200 --> 19:04.200
But while we are bored, we don't have time to be idle,

19:04.200 --> 19:09.200
which Krikgad views, or the esteemed views as a virtue that idleness is a good thing.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.200
I would agree.

19:10.200 --> 19:17.200
Sometimes the most sublime ideas, the most sublime things happen when we are being idle.

19:17.200 --> 19:23.200
It could even be a random interaction with a stranger that happens when we are really not getting up to anything

19:23.200 --> 19:26.200
and not really rushing to the next thing or the next task.

19:26.200 --> 19:35.200
But of course, the problem is because of our current societal ideology of be productive, be busy,

19:35.200 --> 19:40.200
make the best use of your time, and then the other much more, I would say, dark side of things

19:40.200 --> 19:45.200
where people simply don't have time to relax anymore as they simply have to put food on the table.

19:45.200 --> 19:49.200
Just to get by, people are always working, taking multiple jobs.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.200
Idleness is going away.

19:51.200 --> 19:57.200
It's left our existence while we are also fundamentally bored.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.200
There are subtle differences, but they are on the same thing.

20:00.200 --> 20:07.200
Idleness is something at a very practical level that we need to incorporate into our lives,

20:07.200 --> 20:09.200
whereas boredom, it is existential.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.200
It's constitutive of what it means to be human.

20:12.200 --> 20:18.200
In fact, in the book, it stated quite interestingly, we can trace this, so when he means this, he means boredom,

20:18.200 --> 20:20.200
from the very beginning of the world.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.200
The gods were bored, so they created man.

20:22.200 --> 20:26.200
Adam was bored because he was alone, so Eve was created.

20:26.200 --> 20:32.200
From that time, boredom entered the world and grew in exact proportion to the growth of the population.

20:32.200 --> 20:40.200
Adam was bored alone, then Adam and Eve were bored in union, then Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel were bored on famil,

20:40.200 --> 20:45.200
then the population increased, and the peoples were bored on mass.

20:45.200 --> 20:51.200
So my reading of that little bit is that the estate is saying, despite him despising boredom,

20:51.200 --> 20:55.200
despite him finding it repulsive, we can't get rid of it.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.200
At least for the estate, it's kind of like a predicament.

20:58.200 --> 21:02.200
It's not something we can just choose not to have in our lives.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.200
It's a part of being human.

21:04.200 --> 21:12.200
Then he states, this is the problem when we don't have time to be idle,

21:12.200 --> 21:15.200
which is kind of like a practical thing being incorporated into our lives,

21:15.200 --> 21:18.200
but we are still bored, it leads to meaninglessness.

21:18.200 --> 21:22.200
I think that's where it becomes like a social phenomena,

21:22.200 --> 21:26.200
where people have a mental health crisis as a term,

21:26.200 --> 21:33.200
a neologism coined by social psychologists called deaths by despair.

21:33.200 --> 21:40.200
It's simply people dying from unhappiness, not simply it's tragically people dying from unhappiness.

21:40.200 --> 21:47.200
And for CricketGuard, one reason for this would be because we haven't acknowledged the fact that in the core of who we are,

21:47.200 --> 21:50.200
in some sense this void of boredom, and it's there,

21:50.200 --> 21:53.200
and he puts it beautifully here, he says,

21:53.200 --> 21:59.200
boredom rests upon the nothingness that winds its way through existence, its diddiness,

21:59.200 --> 22:04.200
like that which comes from gazing down into an infinite abyss, is infinite.

22:04.200 --> 22:10.200
So you can see from that little line there how thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre were influenced by CricketGuard quite interestingly.

22:10.200 --> 22:16.200
So we need to be able to acknowledge this boredom being a part of our ontological condition.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.200
And then, and then what? And the question is then what?

22:20.200 --> 22:25.200
Given the fact that yes, boredom, for the assiduous evil, and what do we do from there?

22:25.200 --> 22:32.200
CricketGuard, for better or worse, and for my belief is that for better, he is not a self-op author,

22:32.200 --> 22:38.200
so he doesn't really write prescriptive texts except perhaps as more of his religious writing.

22:38.200 --> 22:45.200
The fact of the matter is there really isn't no remedy or panacea to the fact that boredom to the core is a part of who we are,

22:45.200 --> 22:50.200
although one thing that helps in understanding that is that then we acknowledge it

22:50.200 --> 22:55.200
and then we also understand that idleness per se isn't a bad thing.

22:55.200 --> 23:04.200
And in fact, we should probably make time and not listen to the societal imperatives or societal injunctions

23:04.200 --> 23:07.200
to constantly do something and allow ourselves to be idle.

23:07.200 --> 23:11.200
But that doesn't mean any of that is prescriptive and that's not the purpose of this video either.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.200
I don't give advice on this channel.

23:14.200 --> 23:23.200
But to kind of end it on a let's say a positive note, what is the solution to this dilemma, this predicament we are in?

23:23.200 --> 23:29.200
The fact that we are ontologically bored, it's innate to who we are and that we don't have time to be idle,

23:29.200 --> 23:35.200
therefore we have this emptiness and void in the middle of our lives.

23:35.200 --> 23:39.200
And what is the solution to compulsive pathological business?

23:39.200 --> 23:46.200
Now, of course, look, I could give the typical self-advice or kind of discuss, you know, or take time,

23:46.200 --> 23:55.200
have me time in your calendar, lock out me time, I don't know, meditate, go for walks, you know, partake in self-care things.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.200
Those are great, do all of that.

23:57.200 --> 24:01.200
I do most of those things, I exercise, I run, I don't meditate, I hate meditating,

24:01.200 --> 24:05.200
but I do engage in these things because they're great.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.200
It's important to take care of your health.

24:07.200 --> 24:11.200
But for me, still, those are rather superficial things.

24:11.200 --> 24:19.200
What I've found personally is that the kind of the remedy to, I wouldn't even call it a remedy, not the perfect remedy,

24:19.200 --> 24:26.200
but what helps me cope with this existential dread, let's say, or this nappingness, this void of boredom,

24:26.200 --> 24:34.200
is to deeply fall in love with the world, to deeply, not to do the whole Western Buddhist thing where you detach yourself from the world

24:34.200 --> 24:36.200
and be like, oh, everything's a cosmic phenomenon.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.200
No, no, no.

24:37.200 --> 24:42.200
Attach yourself more to the world, care more about the world, and find something you deeply care about.

24:42.200 --> 24:46.200
For me, it happens to be writing, philosophy, politics.

24:46.200 --> 24:54.200
These are things that I would go to the ends of my existence to deeply go all the way in some sense.

24:54.200 --> 25:00.200
And I think that's the only antidote to this boredom we have in existence.

25:00.200 --> 25:07.200
It's not playing this middle game where you do a bit of everything, but rather finding something that's like an infinite passion

25:07.200 --> 25:15.200
that takes you all the way to the end, to the point where, in fact, when you truly care about a certain vocation,

25:15.200 --> 25:22.200
let's say, be it a scientist, a political activist, an engineer, an artist, a philosopher,

25:22.200 --> 25:26.200
you would sacrifice your own world for that course, for the vocation.

25:26.200 --> 25:31.200
If you're building something, if you're writing a book, if you're partaking in some kind of political movement,

25:31.200 --> 25:34.200
especially, I would say, if you're partaking in some kind of political movement,

25:34.200 --> 25:43.200
you would sacrifice your well-being, your happiness, which the estate would find that repulsive.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.200
You would sacrifice all of that for the course.

25:45.200 --> 25:48.200
And I think that is the only way to exist in this world.

25:48.200 --> 25:54.200
It's not through taking this kind of middle ground and trying to optimize everything in your life.

25:54.200 --> 26:05.200
I think that's a lie sold to us so that we can, in fact, be suckers and buy more things off the market.

26:05.200 --> 26:10.200
And of course, for many people, this comes in the form of family.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.200
That is certainly something you can commit yourself to.

26:13.200 --> 26:23.200
But the point being, I don't think, I think the worst thing one could do with Bodum is to ignore it, repress it,

26:23.200 --> 26:35.200
don't look into it, and just take on many things in life and just drown yourself with tasks or businesses to use a word credit card.

26:35.200 --> 26:42.200
I don't mean business in the economic transactional sense, but rather in always doing things and not obviously be idle.

26:42.200 --> 26:46.200
My view one should confront that Bodum is a part of who we are.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.200
It's considerative to our existence.

26:49.200 --> 27:00.200
And then, then kind of go all the way, go all the way, find something that will, that will, that will not just wake you up in the morning,

27:00.200 --> 27:06.200
but even keep you up late at night to the point where it's in fact bad for you.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.200
And I think that's where passion lies.

27:08.200 --> 27:18.200
Passion, for me, much like Bodum, passion itself is a, it's a, it's a, it's what it means to be human.

27:18.200 --> 27:22.200
You will achieve the level of humanity when you truly are passionate about something.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.200
And at least that's what I believe.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.200
But again, I'm not being prescriptive here.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.200
I found that for me, that's the only way to live.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.200
It's life of passion.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.200
Thanks for watching.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.200
Hope you found that useful.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.200
Cheers.
