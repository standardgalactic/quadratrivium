Hey everyone, I just want to make this quick video for one of my favorite

00:05.680 --> 00:11.000
YouTubers and people on the internet right now, coffeezilla, a message from a

00:11.000 --> 00:15.520
fan. I love his work. I think he's one of the most important people on the

00:15.520 --> 00:20.080
internet right now. He's doing true journalism, exposing these scams and

00:20.080 --> 00:25.800
just it's to a almost bizarre and absurd level when a normal guy like me just

00:25.800 --> 00:31.240
sees them and it's unbelievable. And I think he's in great work. He is

00:31.240 --> 00:36.960
extremely insightful, he's brilliant, he works hard and what he creates, his

00:36.960 --> 00:40.920
content is of true value to society. I truly believe that and I'm not trying to

00:40.920 --> 00:45.720
you know blow steam up your ass, I mean sincerely. However, saying all that, saying

00:45.720 --> 00:51.520
all that, here comes the jab jab and the right hook. I do think he makes a huge

00:51.520 --> 00:55.840
mistake. I think he gets one point room, especially when I see him on

00:55.840 --> 01:02.000
podcasts, on huge podcasts like Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan. He portrays all

01:02.000 --> 01:09.160
these scams as being anomalies to the current neoliberal capitalistic order. He

01:09.160 --> 01:12.200
in fact even says that I'm a capitalism, there's really nothing wrong with

01:12.200 --> 01:16.320
capitalism, it's just these things are the anomalies. And I think he makes a

01:16.320 --> 01:22.440
mistake there. I think the best way to portray it is to in fact understand that

01:22.440 --> 01:28.400
these scams are built into the, are built into capitalism itself. They're built

01:28.400 --> 01:33.280
into the antagonisms, the deadlocks, the consumerism, the desires that capitalism

01:33.280 --> 01:39.000
creates and these scams aren't anomalies and they'll only keep getting worse in

01:39.000 --> 01:45.040
the current economic system and the current ideological system we live in. So

01:45.080 --> 01:50.840
look, if he's interested in Epshrew's theory, I would highly recommend him read

01:50.840 --> 01:58.200
anything by Slavoj Džek. Essentially any of these books probably start with the

01:58.200 --> 02:02.920
plague of fantasies, but if he really wants to get some some heavy stuff,

02:02.920 --> 02:10.560
perhaps start with Karl Marx's capital. Now don't get me wrong, while I am an

02:10.560 --> 02:14.320
anti-capitalist, I'm not saying that Marxism is the answer. I don't know what

02:14.320 --> 02:18.320
the answer is to be honest, but sometimes it's not even the answers itself, but

02:18.320 --> 02:22.600
it's the questions that count and perhaps we should start questioning why do

02:22.600 --> 02:27.280
these scams come up every couple of years and why is it, why does it seem like

02:27.280 --> 02:32.160
things are getting worse for the middle class? Why does it seem like we're in the

02:32.160 --> 02:35.680
midst of an ecological crisis and in the midst of a mental health crisis, in the

02:35.680 --> 02:41.040
midst of a almost existential crisis for most people where there are terms like

02:41.360 --> 02:46.880
debts of despair and those questions are perhaps important asking and maybe it is

02:46.880 --> 02:52.200
because of our current ideological system, our current hegemonic system of

02:52.200 --> 02:57.840
capitalism and all these scams, they never really aren't going to go away.

02:57.840 --> 03:03.360
It doesn't matter how many scams Coffizula exposes, as long as things

03:03.360 --> 03:07.840
remain the way they are, they'll still unfortunately still keep coming up and

03:08.480 --> 03:15.280
in fact, probably even get worse. I do like the joke by Slavo Žižek where it's this kind of naive,

03:15.280 --> 03:18.720
I'm not saying Coffizula is naive, I'm saying all of us, we're all naive, we have this

03:19.600 --> 03:24.720
naive hope that there's a light at the end of the tunnel and then Žižek says,

03:24.720 --> 03:31.200
oh, that light is in fact an oncoming train. So in fact, we make structural changes.

03:31.200 --> 03:37.040
Yes, it's important to make changes in individual action and certainly do things

03:37.040 --> 03:42.960
like what Coffizula does where we expose these scams, expose these frauds and even

03:42.960 --> 03:48.240
partake in local communities and try to not get people caught up in MLM schemes or pyramid schemes

03:48.240 --> 03:54.640
or Ponzi schemes or whatnot and all these little games that are that are imbued out of capitalism,

03:54.640 --> 04:01.120
but still we have to make a structural critique and I think given Coffizula is currently

04:01.120 --> 04:05.600
extremely influential and we all know how internet fame works, there's a rice,

04:05.600 --> 04:09.760
you got to make good use of it and then it goes away and people just kind of forget about you,

04:09.760 --> 04:16.640
but at this moment he can really embrace the opportunity and use his platform to show that

04:16.640 --> 04:22.080
no, these scams aren't anomalies, they in fact are built into our system itself.

04:23.520 --> 04:32.000
Simply that's what I want to say and I would highly recommend watching lectures by Žižek on

04:32.000 --> 04:38.480
this matter or even Žižek is a bit too, because he comes from a very theoretical abstract angle

04:39.200 --> 04:45.280
reading a book like Capital by Piketty, where yes Piketty for me isn't radical enough,

04:45.280 --> 04:53.040
but still he does make some good points as to why we in fact are in deep shit

04:53.920 --> 04:56.480
and we need to make some fundamental changes in society.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.480
Okay, I talk too much, I shall let you go. Cheers.
