0	4000	when I was reading that chapter and listening to your lecture
4000	7280	on the set theoretic multiverse, obviously my head went to the
7280	11600	current sort of ongoing debate on the the multiverse theory or the
11600	15760	let's call the interpretation in quantum mechanics or in physics
15760	20560	or I see yeah I'm so because according to my understanding
20560	24160	what you're putting forward with like the set theoretic multiverses
24160	29600	these separate multiverses or let's call it
29600	33120	axiomatic systems for different worlds of set theory
33120	37920	they can still talk to each other whereas I there are still correlations
37920	41040	let's call it whereas I don't think that's the
41040	43840	argument someone like a Sean Carroll would make
43840	48000	when it comes to physics where there's this reality there's another reality
48000	54160	so speaking ontologically are you are you claiming that like
54160	57360	the nature let's say the ontology of mathematics is that
57360	62320	yes there are some universes where the continuum hypothesis
62320	67760	is it works and in some it doesn't do they have relations or are they
67760	72240	completely independent realities if that makes sense
72240	76560	so that's a good question so I guess I have a few things to say about it
76560	81040	so first I think it's probably important to
81040	85520	there's this unfortunate overlap in the term multiverse
85680	88880	there's this whole physical multiverse theory that you were
88880	93440	alluding to which I don't think of as connected at all
93440	97680	with this sort of debate on pluralism in mathematics it's just a totally separate
97680	101680	topic so for example the physical version is connected
101680	104640	with you know superposition of worlds and whether they can interact and so on
104640	107280	and I think that's part of what your question was about
107280	110480	and there are versions of those phenomenon in the set theoretic
110480	114320	multiverse but but I don't think of the set theoretic multiverse as connected
114320	118080	at all with any of those physical theories it's just a different topic
118080	121840	it has you know there's a family resemblance because it's about many
121840	125120	different mathematical worlds and the physical one is about many
125120	129360	different physical worlds but I think that's the end of the
129360	133200	family resemblance and I don't I'm not claiming or
133200	137840	positing any kind of uh deeper connection between the sort of
137840	142080	set theoretic pluralism kinds of multiverse and these physics theories
142080	145360	that talk about a multiverse I think they're just totally different
145360	149600	topics but in terms of whether there's interaction I
149600	152960	think that's extremely and extremely profound philosophical question
152960	157280	on the mathematical side which is where most of my work is
157280	163440	namely so we have these different models of set theory
163440	166880	and the method of forcing and and there is a way
166880	172720	that a one model of set theory can somehow get access to the forcing
172720	177840	extensions because the the the ground model the smaller model
177840	181360	has names for all the individuals that exist in the
181360	184160	forcing extension this is one of the ways that forcing works
184160	188160	we have this concept of having a name and then we have this forcing relation
188160	192240	which tells which expresses in the ground model sort of the
192240	196400	truth conditions of what could be true or might be true in the forcing
196400	200560	extension and this is a degree of access to the extension
200560	207120	and and so it is it like it's not just this kind of pure s5
207120	211200	model situation where we have these totally separate set theoretic worlds
211200	213760	that don't have any connection with one another
213760	217760	and when you move from one another they cannot see each other or
217760	221840	it's not like that at all rather every model of set theory can
221840	225760	look down you know inwardly at the inner models that are defined
225760	229840	inside it for example this is how girdle proved the consistency of ch
229840	235600	he said well take any model of cfc and then inside that model define what's
235600	239280	called the constructible universe which is a kind of
239280	244080	constructible version of the cumulative universe where you only add the bare
244080	249680	minimum at each step you iterate along and whenever you've got a sort of set
249680	253120	that you've built so far then any subset of it that's definable
253120	256800	in that piece you add that at the next level and so you keep
256800	260880	iterating this definable power set operation this was
260880	266640	girdle's uh a genius idea then you get this
266640	271600	inner model of set theory and he proved that all the cfc axioms are true
271600	275520	there including the axiom of choice even if it wasn't true outside
275520	279360	and the continuum hypothesis also and that's how he proved the relative
279360	283840	consistency of the continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice
283840	287840	by showing that inside any model of cfc there's this
287840	293680	deeper model called the constructible universe that satisfies dfc plus ch
293680	297040	and the forcing extension idea is looking sort of
297040	300960	outwardly it's a it's a measure of access that a model has
300960	304960	to the larger models they can't have fully complete access
304960	308720	and one can refute the idea you know there has to
308720	312880	have to be certain kinds of limits but there is some kind of access
312880	316240	and and i find that just fascinating when
316240	320320	the i mean it's a deeply metaphysical
320320	324480	issue about these sort of possible mathematical worlds with different
324480	330160	truths and yet the because these worlds these
330160	333600	mathematical worlds have by by means of the forcing
333600	337120	relation this definable access to these other worlds
337120	340880	they become mathematical questions with precise answers and you can prove
340880	344720	theorems about it and and so it's fascinating when
344720	350400	these deeply philosophical metaphysical mathematical metaphysics
350400	354960	questions turn into mathematical theorems and maybe it comes back to the
354960	359120	first question that you asked me it's really showing the way that these
359120	363920	philosophical issues come directly into the mathematics
