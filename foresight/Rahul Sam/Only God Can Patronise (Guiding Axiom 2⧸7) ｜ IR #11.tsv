0	5840	Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the inner realm podcast. It's been a while. Yes,
5840	13440	indeed. I took a small break from podcasting and sort of focused a bit more on computer science and
13440	19840	software engineering type content, which I shall be uploading on the YouTube channel too. But I'm
20640	28000	happy and excited to get back on the podcast again. I have some great conversations lined up,
28000	34240	but also on top of that, some of my own pieces that I'm putting together, I propose
34800	41680	Heidegger and phenomenology. So clearly, please give me a bit of time and a bit of grace because
41680	47120	obviously it's not easy stuff to comprehend, man. I'll tell you that. Heidegger is most certainly
47120	55360	dense and it's hard to really get him. However, today I'll be focusing on something I started
55360	61680	a couple of months ago, reading out these guiding axioms from my newsletter. So I've already laid
61680	66480	down seven axioms. I've been writing a bit on the background and I've been, I want to read all of
66480	71440	them out in this podcast because something I realized was, oh, these, these guiding axioms that
71440	75920	I'm laying down for the newsletter, the unhappy man newsletter, by the way, if I didn't already
75920	81040	mentioned that links down below in the description if you want to subscribe to it. And in any case,
81040	90960	these axioms are essentially a, an heralding framework for all of my, let's say creative work.
91600	98160	Any content I produce on the podcast or anything that I write, I want to ensure that I do it within
98160	103920	the, I don't want to say bounce because that sounds restrictive, but at least these axioms will be
103920	109520	sort of a framework for me to work through. And it also helps lay down my thoughts as to
110320	115840	why the bloody hell do I do any of this in the first place? To be fair, I haven't got an answer
115840	125360	to that yet. Well, that's a whole other conversation, but today's guiding axiom number two is only
125360	132720	gold can patronize. And the previous axiom I covered was restrain the urge to overcome
132720	139120	unhappiness with ideological prescription. If you haven't listened to watch that episode already,
139520	143920	I'll leave a link to that in the description down below too. But today it's guiding axiom,
143920	153440	guiding axiom. I, for some reason, I, I keep saying guardians of the galaxy or like,
153440	161200	guardian axiom. It's odd. Guiding axiom number two is only gold can patronize.
162720	166320	So I've said here, the following is a second guiding axiom for this newsletter.
166400	170800	Yeah, happy man. It's one of the many that I hope to share in the upcoming weeks. I wrote this a
170800	176560	while back, so I've already shared these. As I'm writing these, it's dawn on me that these aren't
176560	183120	a mere helm solely for writing, but rather I seem to be setting up a framework for all of my creative
183120	190000	life itself. As I said before, so thank you. And yes, I mean that sincerely. Thank you for letting
190000	195840	me be self-indulgent in this manner. It is, I've always thought a lot of what I do is rather
195840	201040	self-indulgent, but I take no shame in the matter. There's nothing wrong with a bit of,
201040	205600	a bit of good nature, self-indulgence, self-indulgence or egoism, let's say.
207120	213680	Okay, let's get started. I feel a deep love for Jesus Christ. Does anyone that dares to call
213680	220480	himself Gordon Connard, it ought to be Christ? But he also exasperates me by saying things like this.
221520	228160	And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children
228160	233600	or lands, for my namesake, shall receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life.
234960	242160	Matthew, 1929. I can only imagine the overweening goal at hubris one has to make such supercilious
242160	249520	proclamations. If anyone else made such demands of me, I tell them to go take a hike. And that's
249520	255840	me being polite to keep this newsletter decent. Pause. What I meant to really say there was,
256400	262560	I tell them to fuck off. I don't know why I was censoring myself there. Most contemporary
262560	269040	theologians tend to eschew Christianity and present a tepid, mellowed down version of it
269120	275120	for a more emasculated audience. But Jesus meant what he explicitly stated. And there's no getting
275120	282000	around it with hermeneutical trickery. In that sense, I'm a Christian not for its reasonableness,
282000	289600	but instead for its sheer radicalism and scandalous unreasonableness. Perhaps it's the
289600	295520	audacity for Jesus to casually patronize the masses that truly makes him Gordon Connard.
296480	302720	I doubt even the most egomaniacal narcissists think of themselves as humanity's savior.
304240	310560	I'm not anyone's savior. Hang out for that. The burden of such a responsibility would be
310560	317920	too unbearable. I'm happy to leave that with Christ. Therefore, I will not patronize and
317920	324720	talk down to anyone. Presumably, only the Son of God can do that. So, I won't molecule the reader
324720	330720	with superfluous, so I won't molecule the reader or listener in this case, with superfluous caveats
330720	337520	and footnotes. If what I write isn't clear, then it's either my fault for being an inept writer
337520	342880	and I need to improve my craft or you need to educate yourself and learn to wrestle with a
342880	349680	given piece to extract its meaning. I suspect that the former will be the case most of the time.
350160	356000	Besides, reading should not be treated as a leisurely activity one engages into past one's time.
357120	364240	I point that the commitment towards lucidity lies within both parties. If we repudiate
364240	370560	this responsibility without inability to struggle with the peace of creation anymore,
370560	376560	artistic, philosophical or otherwise, we're forever trapped in the banality of modern life.
377520	382720	Perhaps, it's similar to what David Foster Wallace observed about popular
382720	388480	entertainment, which has capitulated to a lust for immediacy and constant sensuousness.
389440	397040	Christly put, for us post-industrial modernists, art has no qualitative value over yet another
397040	403120	commercial action flick, fast food or pornography. Is this the post-modern curse?
403440	411440	So, modern art has to be dumbed down to attract the masses. Nothing is more patronizing and
411440	417440	insulting to the human spirit than this. It's not egalitarianism, but a peculiar form of
417440	424400	aristocratic bigotry. For Wallace, the arts, especially literature, can bring unspeakable
424400	430880	depth and meaning to our lives, but it requires toil. It should never be treated as a distraction
430880	437680	but rather as something that accentuates and reveals all of life itself. For instance, I thought
437680	443680	eminent artists and philosophers intentionally obfuscated their work for pretentiousness and
443680	450320	elitism. Well, there certainly are cases where this is true. Vanity takes many forms. The more
450320	457200	I've labored at reading and immersing myself in art and philosophy, I've concluded that it's mostly
457200	465440	my ignorance and complacency. It rarely was the piece of work, but my indolent unwillingness to
465440	471520	persevere through. In that spirit, I will not treat any of my readers or listeners as lost sheep in
471520	478000	need of a good, sagacious shepherd. Besides, apart from the reasons mentioned above, it's also because
478000	484320	I must admit, in all candor, I'm starting this newsletter or podcast primarily for a selfish
484320	490960	reason. It's a forum for me about everyone else to seek truth, if such a thing exists and it's
490960	498480	even knowable to us. Then you may ask why I share my writings publicly. Partially, it's for criticism
498480	504320	and feedback so that I can update my perspectives, a contrived form of collective cognition and
504320	512480	decision making, so to speak. It may be pomp and vanity too, but predominantly because I profoundly
512480	520080	resonate with an adage, apocryphally attributed to Carl R. Rogers, Carl Rogers, the American
520080	527280	humanist psychologist. What is most personal is most universal. I think the essence of this
527280	532240	sentiment, it caused that unforgettable line from Schindler's List taken from the Talmud,
533120	541040	he who saves one life, saves the world entire. Of course, I'm not at least consciously
541040	547920	in the world saving business, but it rings true that the individual struggle is the human struggle.
548480	555440	The individual questions are instantiations of the seeking human heart. For one to suffer is for
555440	562240	many to suffer and to love another is to love humanity and entire. Perhaps, God has no other
562240	569440	option than to create us in his own image, so that as that's what being human ontologically means,
570160	576480	where a locus of divine paradoxes, or as Justice F.C. wrote, the awful thing is that beauty is
576480	582720	mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are fighting there and the battlefield
582720	588880	is the heart of man. If he weren't created in his image, then he wouldn't be human beings,
588880	594640	but some other thing. Such claims can never be proven intellectually, but only be made
594640	602960	realize to run through life alone. You may never entirely comprehend what it feels like
602960	608960	when I say I'm in pain or agony, nor can you ever take my place and feel it for me,
609520	615840	but you still know what I mean when I say I'm hurting. While we undoubtedly have our subjective
615840	622640	individual experience that can never be generalized, represented as a mere categorical abstraction,
622640	629360	that to my great annoyance, modern psychology tends to do, we also have a trans-subjective
629360	636320	common human experience. And writing with the exception of music, I find, is the most beautiful
636320	643040	way of tapping into our shared realm, such as why I believe only God can patronize,
643040	649440	and I will never patronize ever in this podcast. At least, that is what I'm striving to do. Thanks
649440	651440	for watching.
