0	4340	Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the Interrelant Podcast.
4340	12440	I've got to say, I'm in a really good mood today because I just sat for the AWS developer
12440	15900	associate examination and passed it.
15900	16900	So I'm feeling good.
16900	21740	It's always a good feeling to, you know, work towards something and then kind of achieve
21740	25180	it and well, I guess now what?
25180	28580	Back to the meaninglessness of life.
28580	34520	In any case, this is kind of an interesting episode because the previous episode I did
34520	38860	a few weeks ago was my first ever book review.
38860	47580	And I think this is going to be the first ever article, article or let's say essay commentary.
47580	54980	And it's going to be on the piece that David Dunyong, I really hope I pronounce your surname
54980	55980	right.
55980	56980	David, apologies.
56980	59540	I mean, no disrespect.
59540	65260	It's going to be on the polemical piece that David wrote on Jordan Peterson.
65260	72500	And frankly, from everything I've read on Jordan Peterson, you know, I think today this
72500	80100	is the best criticism I've read of him in a very deep sense, not in like a superficial,
80100	85220	you know, I don't know, the kind of the what like corporate media does, sort of dismissive
85220	88740	calling him a French far right, whatever.
88740	97340	But I really thought David's criticism was very apt to the current situation, but also
97340	98340	just philosophical.
98340	101620	It was quite deep and he made a lot of sense.
101620	102620	And he's a great writer.
102620	107180	I only hope to write like David one day.
107180	114740	Now I've got to say, of course, as I said, this piece is a polemic and like myself, unlike
114740	124140	myself, David is very, very critical of Peterson and doesn't like him at all.
124140	128460	I personally do like Jordan Peterson quite a lot.
128460	133820	I've been influenced by him, especially I'd say when I was about 20, 21, this is like
133820	140380	around 2016, I started watching his lectures early on and I really enjoyed his lectures.
140380	148300	I still very much enjoy the lectures he did on psychologists, like for example, I think
148300	153740	my best learning on John P.J. was through Jordan Peterson.
153740	158940	I'd even say Jordan Peterson was the person who introduced me to Heidegger a couple of
158940	163260	years ago, even though, you know, Peterson doesn't really go into Heidegger's philosophy
163260	167140	kind of, he lectures on him through like a psychological lens.
167140	173860	In any case, the point that I make is that I really like Jordan Peterson.
173860	180620	And that's exactly the reason I think it's important for me to make this episode and
180620	186980	record this and I'm now getting to more as to why that is later on.
186980	192340	So firstly, I want to put a quick caveat as I tend to do with these episodes.
192340	200220	I will truly try and keep away from the day-to-day politics or contemporary issues Peterson gets
200220	201940	himself involved in.
201940	203300	He tends to do that from time to time.
203300	204660	I think he kind of likes it.
204660	209140	Let's be honest, he likes the attention, you know, I mean, I love the doc, but he loves
209140	217700	the attention he gets, but rather in David's paper, I'm going to focus on the philosophical
217700	218700	critiques.
218700	220380	Oh, I didn't mention this.
220380	224780	By the way, how I came across this was actually through David's YouTube channel, Theory and
224780	232980	Philosophy, which I'd say now at this point in my life is my greatest source of learning
232980	240620	when it comes to philosophy and theory, especially being a software engineer, having no background
240620	242940	in arts or the humanities.
242940	245260	I studied computer science.
245260	251300	I didn't even know how to study or learn about all these different theories and philosophies
251300	258540	because I never had any proper formal academic training, even though I deeply love the humanities.
258540	260940	I really appreciate it.
260940	261940	It means a lot to me.
261940	266460	I spend so much of my time trying to understand it and, you know, read philosophy and literature
266460	269140	and all of that.
269140	274660	So I'd say this point in my life without a question, man, David's YouTube channel is
275220	278420	one of my greatest sources of learning.
278420	282420	It's a great resource, really, to go through, virtually any book, I'll go through some of
282420	284980	the stuff he did later on.
284980	289940	Recently I went through his Kant, a critic of pure recent series.
289940	295740	My favorite banan was the one he did on Hannah Arendt.
295740	301060	My God, such a good series, David, really, you just have an amazing ability, you're so
301060	302060	eloquent.
303060	309580	Also, I like that you speak with no pretension, which I appreciate as a layperson or as a
309580	310580	neophyte.
310580	316660	So, sorry, I'm kind of all over the place, but in the preamble, I want to say, as I said,
316660	320700	I try to stick to more of the philosophical critiques, more of the ideological critiques
320700	327780	and not get too enravelled in the kind of day-to-day fleeting politics, let's say.
328780	333060	And, of course, as I said, I'm a big fan of Peterson.
333060	340940	I also like some of the figures in the Intellectual Dark Web, and that begs the question, why should
340940	349220	we be skeptical and question these public intellectuals, people like Sam Harris, Jordan
349220	356820	Peterson, Brett Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, oh God, Harvey Weinstein.
356820	363220	That's funny, what's Brett's brother's name, Eric Weinstein, we should definitely question
363220	364220	Harvey Weinstein.
364220	368420	Ah, right, that was, that was, I swear, that was an intentional, that was just a mistake.
368420	374460	In any case, all these people in the Intellectual Dark Web, why we should question them, and
374460	381220	I think the reason is because, firstly, whenever, personally, whenever I feel that the narratives
381220	389260	that people give out to the world, or the philosophies people propagate and advocate
389260	393820	for, let's say, when they're too coherent, when they're too, let's say, when they're
393820	400300	too much of like a salvation, when they're too redemptive, or when they're too, this
400300	404780	is it, we've got the absolute philosophy, we've got the absolute ideology to make something
404780	409940	work, I generally take a step back and I become a bit skeptical, because for me, you know,
409940	415820	in many ways I'm an absurdist, so there really isn't the kind of coherence that a lot of
415820	420140	the people in the Intellectual Dark Web would like to portray.
420140	425220	And it's actually a point David gets to in his article, which is what I really liked.
425220	433540	So I think whenever we feel like we're getting easy, easy answers, easy solutions, or not
433540	442500	even easy really, but the kind of solutions that seem straightforward without any deeper
442500	449220	introspection and deeper inspection into it, I think we should be skeptical of those kind
449220	450220	of solutions.
450220	459100	And I would say, speaking personally, around two or three years ago, when I really started
459100	464900	to like Jordan Peterson, I realized that I was liking him a bit too much, almost to
464900	467380	the level of obsequiousness.
467380	473380	And that was definitely unhealthy, because I realized, wow, I can't even read an honest
473380	478540	criticism of his work without taking it personally, as if he's some of my personal savior or
478540	479540	whatever.
479540	487140	And, and that's when I truly wanted to only again, treat Jordan Peterson as a person who
487140	493700	influences me, but not as the only point of influence or like this kind of he's in Christ
493700	497860	to put it in a dramatic way.
497860	502300	And that's when I started questioning him a bit more and looking for points of view that
502300	508260	differ from him points of view that, you know, he's completely a versatile, let's say, and
508260	515020	I realized, oh, wow, I actually completely disagree or predominantly with most of his
515020	516020	points.
516020	522620	I disagree with his politics and even his underlying philosophy, despite, and his interesting thing,
522620	529860	despite truly starting to admire and like him as a person, as an individual, as a teacher
529860	536860	and as a psychologist, like I still find his work on psychology to be brilliant.
536860	544420	I think he's a great psychologist, even though I think he's got his politics and his philosophy
544980	547500	and I see a lot of loopholes with his worldview.
547500	553580	And as a person, you know, I've got to say, again, one, one never, one never knows, especially
553580	558780	with public figures, how they portray themselves in public, you know, that kind of distinction
558780	564620	between the private life and the person, between the personal life and the public life.
564620	566340	Peterson looks like a genuine person to me.
566340	572620	He looks sincere and I'm, you know, speaking purely personally, I'm the kind of person
573100	579700	that appreciates family and having a good relationship with your significant other,
579700	586460	your wife, your spouse, whatever, your children, and I find that he's got that kind of relationship
586460	592900	and it seems just that that true love of a family and I appreciate anyone who can foster
592900	599300	that and who can have that in life because that certainly takes work.
599300	606620	So yeah, those are the points of the preamble and that, of course, leads me to this point
606620	610460	and I wasn't even going to put this part in the episode, but I realized that actually
610460	615780	maybe it's something I should talk about before I get to the article itself.
615780	620900	I still don't know if David Steeleman or Strowman, Peterson's arguments.
620900	625940	I don't know if he mischaracterized him and whether he, how he portrayed Peterson's
625980	633940	oppositions to Bill C-16, got to keep in mind David too is a philosophy student.
633940	637220	I think he's doing a PhD in philosophy.
637220	638580	Anyway, he's an art student.
638580	645900	So, you know, I don't want to make an argument from authority, but I do think someone who's
645900	651660	taken the time to go and study theory and go and study philosophy in academia.
651740	657300	I sell whole academia in high regard, contrary to most people on the internet.
657300	661740	And I would say a person like that probably has a better understanding of some of the
661740	668940	intricacies of these debates when it comes to free speech, pronouns, all the different
668940	673820	fragments that are connected in the whole Bill C-16 controversy.
673820	679940	So I didn't get the impression that David was trying to mischaracterize Peterson, but
679940	686700	also that's the one reason for that is because sometimes Peterson himself isn't coherent
686700	691380	with what his arguments are in his opposition to Bill C-16.
691380	697540	He will say it's a purely free speech issue, but then you can see from some of the interviews,
697540	701700	which is the interview that I'm going to play right now, that it's no, no, it's not just
701700	702700	a free speech issue.
702700	706140	He's got an issue with the gender identification too.
706140	712660	So without me putting words in his mouth, let's listen to this short clip that I found
712660	721580	on Majid Nawaz's show where, I mean, this was in 2018, so a bit after the whole controversy
721580	723580	broke out.
723580	728260	And I think this is the most, this is the shortest clip I could find where Peterson lays
728260	735180	down his points, kind of enumerates all his points as to why he opposes Bill C-16.
735180	737500	So let's take a look.
737500	743700	Bill C-16 purported to do nothing but extend human rights provisions to an excluded group,
743700	748220	let's say, to the transgender and non-gender binary types.
748220	750700	And that was the federal legislation.
750700	756540	It also made it a hate crime to discriminate or harass, essentially.
756540	760460	So now then the question is, well, what exactly do you mean by discriminate or harass?
760460	763580	And why exactly is that a hate crime under the criminal code?
763580	765740	Well, there was an answer to that.
765740	770420	The answer was, well, this bill will be interpreted in light of the policies generated by the
770420	773540	Ontario Human Rights Commission, very large set of policies.
773540	777180	Now the Ontario Human Rights Commission is a radically leftist organization.
777180	780940	I think it's the most dangerous organization in Canada, although you could debate that.
780940	782460	Of course, I've got to make a comment.
782460	786180	So I'm going to make comments in the middle of what he's saying.
786180	789820	I mean, if you want to watch the whole thing without me interrupting, just go and watch
789820	790820	the original video.
790820	797020	But you see, this is another thing what Peter said, as much as I like him, you know, when
797020	802420	he makes a statement, such a blatant statement that the Ontario Human Rights Commission is
802420	807380	the most dangerous organization in all of Canada.
807380	815060	That's where, you know, touching on my earlier point, one should take a step back and, oh,
815060	816060	is it really?
816060	817660	Like, what does he mean by that?
817660	824540	The most dangerous, that's quite a leap to call an organization the most dangerous organization
824540	826820	in all of Canada.
826820	831420	This is where I think we should pause the video because it's normally on YouTube that
831420	836940	he's popular and actually think and not let him, when I mean him, I mean, Peterson or
836940	840260	anyone for that matter do the thinking for us.
840260	842100	So back to the video.
842100	847460	Debate that and they said all sorts of policies about how this legislation was going to be
847460	853540	interpreted and the federal government linked to their website to state that Bill C16 would
853540	855580	be interpreted in light of those guidelines.
855580	857540	So I went and read all the policies.
857540	862860	Well one of the policies was that if you didn't use the preferred pronouns of a given group
862860	866620	that you could be charged essentially with a hate crime.
866620	867620	And I thought, no.
867620	868620	Which given group is that?
868620	869780	You mean talking about transgender people?
869780	870780	Yeah.
870780	872100	And so there's all these pronouns that have come up.
872100	877420	There's 70 different sets of pronouns approximately to hypothetically describe people who don't
877540	881740	fit anywhere on the gender spectrum, which is also something that I don't really understand.
881740	883740	I don't understand that conceptually.
883740	885240	We'll come to that.
885240	887340	But I just want to hear the story of this bill first.
887340	888340	Well, okay.
888340	893300	So now a person is compelled under Canadian law to use the pronoun of another individual's
893300	895900	choice by on pain of law.
895900	898420	And I thought, well no, that's not acceptable.
898420	902540	It's one thing to put limits on what a person can't say, like say with hate speech laws,
902540	904500	which I also don't agree with by the way.
904500	905980	But that's a different argument.
906060	908060	I think it's a narrower argument.
908060	914300	But to compel me to use a certain content when I'm formulating my thoughts or my actions
914300	918060	under threat of legislative action, I thought, no, what's happened there is the government
918060	921580	has introduced compelled speech legislation into the private sphere.
921580	924220	It's never happened in the history of English common law.
924220	926340	And so I said, there's no way I'm abiding by that.
926340	928260	I don't care what your damn rationale is.
928260	929260	We're compassionate.
929260	930500	It's like, no, you're not.
930500	931500	No, you're not.
931500	935060	You're playing this radical collectivist left wing game.
935060	941380	You're trying to gain linguistic supremacy in the area of public discourse.
941380	944980	You're doing that using compassion as a guise and you're pulling the wool over people's
944980	947580	eyes and you're not going to do it with me.
947580	952340	If I was sitting here in front of you as a transgendered male to female or female to
952340	956700	male and we began the conversation at the beginning of the conversation you stumbled
956700	961620	and called me he or she and I was perhaps identifying the other way around.
961620	964660	And then if I'd said to you, please, I'd rather go by she.
964660	966540	How would you respond to that on a personal level?
966540	968460	Well, it would depend on the situation.
968460	972780	But the way I have responded to that because I've had a number of conversations with transgendered
972780	977420	individuals is that I use whatever pronoun seems to go along with the persona that they're
977420	978900	projecting publicly.
978900	980740	It's the simplest thing to do.
980740	984660	Now, if we were if you would respect their choice on an individual level.
984660	991300	Yeah, yeah, yeah, but with a with a with a more contentious pronouns, G insurer and
991300	993860	that sort of thing, that's a whole different issue.
993860	997460	Because the question there is, well, exactly what is it that you're doing when you're
997460	999300	asking me to use those words?
999300	1003180	Like are you are you compelling me to play your particular ideological game?
1003180	1006500	Or is this actually a matter of some personal identity that's important to you?
1006500	1008340	And those things are not obvious.
1008340	1012820	And so in a situation like that, the first thing I'd have to do is to try to figure out
1012820	1016380	just exactly what was going on in the situation and that's not simple.
1016380	1020500	And so there would be no foregone conclusion that I would address you by the pronouns
1020500	1021500	of your choice.
1021860	1025380	The first thing I'd want to find out is, is that just a narcissistic power play?
1025580	1027460	Because that's actually the most likely outcome.
1027660	1030460	I don't know if that's the most likely outcome.
1030460	1032180	And, you know, Peterson does make a good point.
1032180	1040100	Like, again, there are manipulative, almost psychopathic narcissists in this world who
1040100	1044540	want to manipulate people and play power games.
1044540	1047420	So that certainly is the case.
1047420	1053860	But again, this is, OK, so I've got a few points to make on what Peterson just said.
1054060	1060860	On what Majid Nawaz said about on a personal level, that's an important word he's
1061060	1063700	personal. I think a lot of this comes down to that.
1063900	1068180	It comes down to those interpersonal relations and how we treat each other.
1068380	1072500	We can't bureaucratize it, even though I feel like
1072660	1078900	modern society is trying to, in many ways,
1079100	1085740	everything is everything is abstracted out into the into the ether, into the bureaucracy,
1085940	1090420	you know, into like the Kafkaist bureaucracy, and then even things that are so intimate
1090620	1094100	and so personal, modernity is bureaucratizing it.
1094300	1098660	And it's kind of unfortunate because a lot of this, which should be dealt at an
1098660	1107660	individual level is trying to be dealt with with laws and policies, which,
1107860	1109340	frankly, I don't think works.
1109540	1111140	I don't firstly, it's not authentic.
1111340	1116420	And secondly, this practically, I think it fails.
1116620	1121740	And then on the point Peterson makes about what kind of game you're playing.
1121740	1125900	So you can clearly see that for him, it's not just a free speech issue,
1126140	1128940	a gender issue, just play a factor.
1129140	1134340	And he also is particularly averse to people who are gender fluid or people who are
1134540	1138940	non-binary, you can see that he doesn't, he doesn't click for him.
1139140	1140580	He can't comprehend what that means.
1140780	1142900	And, you know, fair enough, I mean,
1143100	1147780	to a certain extent, I never really had a problem with the whole gender fluid thing.
1147980	1154060	I always felt deep down in a very visceral sense that, yeah, gender certainly doesn't
1154100	1156300	seem something that's binary.
1156500	1159100	It doesn't seem like something that's fixed.
1159300	1162740	In fact, I don't think human nature is fixed.
1162940	1167420	I think human nature is way more dynamic than we think.
1167620	1171180	It's a lot more deeper than what,
1171380	1175980	you know, in modernity, the post enlightenment era, we would like to put
1176180	1178900	everything in comfortable boxes.
1179100	1182100	It's a human nature is a lot more deeper than that, in my opinion.
1182140	1185340	And David kind of touches on that in his article, too.
1185540	1191780	But also his thing about, see, this is where, again, I don't know whether
1191980	1196260	Peterson does a good job and how he articulates his points.
1196460	1201820	Because it seems a bit vitriolic or it seems a bit hateful the way he
1202020	1204420	talks about non-binary people.
1204420	1207260	Again, you know, these are just I'm just touching on my intuitions.
1207260	1211220	I'm not saying this is exactly what he's saying, not at all.
1211460	1216740	You know, when he says are non-binary people playing some kind of
1216940	1221580	narcissistic power player or trying to manipulate other people.
1221780	1224140	Personally, for my experience,
1224340	1227460	I've actually I've only really got one non-binary friend, because all of my
1227660	1232020	other friends are transgender, which means all the other friends in the LGBTQ community,
1232220	1236260	I mean, which means, you know, they still identify just by the opposite gender,
1236460	1237620	not the one that was assigned it.
1237620	1239060	But then, you know, that's that's fine.
1239100	1244260	And some of them, one of them, actually, I don't even know until she told me.
1244460	1247820	In any case, the non-binary people, yeah, it is a bit odd.
1248020	1251740	I'm going to be totally honest, referring someone as they.
1251940	1257220	But this person that I do know, in no way did I get the impression that this person
1257420	1262860	was playing some kind of game or this person was trying to manipulate me to,
1263060	1268020	you know, as Peterson says, is trying to control my linguistic territory.
1268220	1269660	I didn't get that impression at all.
1269660	1271740	And if I did, I wouldn't be that person's friend.
1271940	1275060	I wouldn't associate that person simple as that.
1275260	1280020	And I think person genuinely didn't feel like a man or a woman or felt non-binary,
1280020	1280700	whatever that means.
1280700	1282660	I don't know what that means, because I don't feel like that.
1282860	1285820	And that's something we've got to learn about.
1286020	1292580	Even he, you know, about life itself, that in some sense, you know,
1292780	1295820	this is apocryphally attributed to character God.
1295820	1299380	But, you know, when you label me, you negate me, I think it comes
1299580	1303620	from this character God's idea that in many ways, that deep
1303820	1307980	inanness, that subjectivity of being human,
1308180	1309700	that it can never be quantified.
1309900	1316300	It can never be properly betrayed or abstracted out from the individual.
1316500	1319500	No one will ever know what it feels like to be me.
1319700	1324540	Nor will I ever know what it feels like to be some other specific individual,
1324820	1328060	not an abstract humanity, no, no, no, a specific individual.
1328060	1331100	And that's for me, you know, my thinking has been heavily influenced
1331300	1333220	by character God in that way.
1333420	1337340	And, you know, far enough, Peterson, too, you know, talks a lot about character God.
1337540	1341660	So saying all that with that long preamble, good Lord, it's 20 minutes already.
1341660	1344700	And I haven't even got to David's article yet.
1344900	1347620	Let's discuss David's piece.
1347820	1349780	The article is titled
1349940	1354380	Jordan Peterson and the flow of scientific inquiry,
1354580	1360060	a critical evaluation of Peterson's use of science and philosophy
1360260	1366060	in his conquest against social justice by David Gagnon.
1366260	1367780	Again, I'm so sorry if I got to say
1367980	1370980	him wrong, David, I truly mean no disrespect.
1371180	1376380	So the article starts off by two quotes by Baudrillard and Nietzsche.
1376580	1378820	And I also want to say
1379020	1384500	I only knew of Baudrillard as his name in the French intellectual circles.
1384700	1387580	It's because of David that I've actually truly kind of
1387780	1390500	delved into his work a bit more and started to understand him.
1390500	1393780	So again, as I said, David's YouTube channel has had a YouTube channel,
1393980	1395940	has had what kind of speak?
1396140	1400180	David's YouTube channel has had a massive influence
1400380	1401980	on me in the past year or so.
1402180	1404060	So I'm truly grateful for that, David.
1404260	1407500	OK, back to the article.
1408460	1413020	If all enigmas are resolved, the stars go out.
1413220	1416660	If everything's secret is returned to the visible,
1416860	1420620	if all illusion is returned to transparent,
1420820	1424580	then heaven becomes become indifferent to the earth.
1424780	1428020	Jean Baudrillard, what is the purpose?
1428220	1432380	And worst still, what is the origin of all science?
1432540	1439420	What is scientific method, perhaps no more than fear
1439620	1445300	of and flight from pessimism, a cycle of defense against truth?
1445500	1451220	Or to put it in moral terms, is it something like cowardice and insincerity?
1451420	1454300	To put it immorally, is it a form of cunning?
1454500	1459060	Oh, Socrates Socrates, was that perhaps your secret?
1459220	1464580	Oh, mysterious ironies versus perhaps your irony?
1464780	1466580	Fredric Nietzsche.
1467940	1470100	David starts off the article saying,
1470300	1475180	this article argues that Peterson's challenge to postmodern port
1475380	1478620	as an anti-scientific doctrine is perplexing,
1478820	1483020	given the general general lack of consensus between his views
1483220	1486420	and those of the greater scientific community.
1486580	1490740	The article presents different theoretical frameworks attesting
1490940	1494100	to the reality of gender non-conforming identities,
1494300	1498460	as well as to the consequences of denying these identities.
1498660	1504020	And argues that rather than challenging oppressive systems of governance,
1504220	1507860	Peterson's project actually mirrors them.
1508660	1510700	So pretty much the article breaks down
1510900	1514460	JB's project into three broad conceptual domains.
1514500	1518380	The three of them are the first one's arguments about postmodernism.
1518580	1523820	So Peterson's averseness against postmodernism and how he portrays postmodernism.
1524020	1527740	And of course, the most interesting part, in my opinion, that I had,
1527940	1532020	I learned a lot from this part, really, the part where David touches
1532220	1536300	on the scientific discourse, truth and objectivity.
1536500	1539220	Brilliant, brilliant section of the article.
1539420	1543340	And the other part is the more of the political part, let's say,
1544020	1545380	on gender identity.
1545580	1548140	Now, I'll focus on the latter.
1548340	1550580	Sorry, I'll focus on the former,
1550780	1554660	the arguments about postmodernism and the scientific discourse, truth and
1554860	1559100	objectivity parts over the latter, which is the gender identity part, simply because
1559300	1563660	for me, I don't know if I'm speaking from a position of privilege here,
1563660	1567060	but I didn't really care too much about the whole gender identity issue,
1567260	1569180	because it didn't really personally affect me.
1569380	1572700	And even in this article, that was the part that I sort of
1572860	1576660	I did read it a couple of times for this video, but just skimmed over.
1576860	1579420	It didn't really speak to me in a deeper sense.
1579620	1584860	But certainly, the poems David make are quite interesting, especially when he
1585060	1588180	speaks of Judith Butler and Baudrillard.
1588380	1590020	I'm going to get to that part a bit later,
1590220	1593180	but I do recommend reading the whole thing, of course, because unlike a book,
1593180	1596780	this is an article, so you could just read it in one sitting.
1597700	1600180	David David states,
1600380	1605500	this article presents counter arguments and evidence that destabilized the
1605700	1610580	facile deployment of a scientific rationality by Peterson and his allies,
1610780	1615300	and therefore calls into question many of his central claims.
1615500	1618660	This paper moves through each of these domains
1618860	1623340	methodically, beginning with his juxtaposition of postmodernism with
1623460	1630180	neo-Marxism, all the while claiming to be a faithful reader to Frederick Nietzsche.
1630380	1635060	That point there, all the while claiming to be a faithful reader to Frederick
1635260	1637780	Nietzsche is an important one, because
1637980	1641580	maybe I'll get to that later on in detail, but
1641780	1643500	if someone
1643700	1649620	listens to Peterson's lectures and then gets this impression of who Nietzsche is
1649780	1653900	and then actually reads Nietzsche,
1654100	1656980	in my opinion, at least, it's a completely different.
1657180	1661100	So the contradiction is very evident,
1661300	1665500	because the actual Nietzsche is very much different to the kind of Nietzsche
1665700	1667260	Peterson portrays, in my opinion.
1667260	1668740	So that's an important one.
1668740	1671860	And I thought that was a good point, David, raised in this article.
1672060	1673740	This is something I started feeling
1673940	1677540	about two years ago when I actually started reading Nietzsche's work,
1677740	1681020	especially the gay science
1681220	1683460	and the anger and evil.
1683660	1685060	So
1685260	1689060	anyway, that's an interesting thing to think about.
1689260	1692100	Of course, I also found there's a problem with
1692300	1700140	Peterson's sort of prima facie associating postmodernism with totalitarianism.
1700340	1704420	And I think David, again, brings this point to Salience, too.
1704500	1707500	And furthermore, the kind of the
1707700	1713660	incommensurability between neo-Marxism, which is a metanarrative and postmodernism.
1713860	1719380	You know, David asks, is it true that postmodernism is merely a clever Marxist
1719580	1727140	side of hand seeking like its Marxist predecessor to undermine the West?
1727340	1730140	Well, again, if you listen to
1730140	1732300	Peterson, that's the impression you get.
1732500	1741940	But if you do a bit more excavating into, let's say, the over of postmodern
1742140	1744340	philosophy and literature, which is
1744540	1748940	virtually an impossible task, because there's so much.
1749140	1751020	You might get a different impression.
1751220	1756660	But even if you read the, let's say, the well known postmodernist or the kind
1756700	1759900	of postmodernist Peterson talks about like Derrida and Foucault,
1760100	1763700	you'd find that, oh, actually, no, you know, it's not easy to just pinpoint them
1763900	1768860	as Marxist. I mean, Foucault was an anarchist, for God's sake.
1769460	1771100	And then.
1771300	1775260	This is again is a good point I've spoken about as before in my previous episodes.
1775460	1777300	And David certainly puts in a much more
1777500	1781180	articulate and eloquent manner than I have ever done.
1781420	1785180	Scientific rationality is fragile and we can't
1785380	1790540	unequivocally place faith on the science.
1790740	1794300	I'm pretty in quotes because the science is a very
1794500	1798660	determined with a lot of baggage, the science.
1798860	1804940	We can't put this kind of faith of science being universal,
1805140	1807180	a historical, a cultural.
1807380	1809740	And most certainly when we take the scientific
1810500	1813220	constitution, we can't derive social values from it.
1813420	1818020	That's a good point David makes using Baudrillard.
1818220	1821580	And I was thinking about this recently.
1821780	1825540	The intellectual dark web, Peterson, all these, I mean, I know the intellectual
1825740	1830700	dark web doesn't really exist anymore, but people, you know, from that elk
1830900	1835060	would agree with this statement, I think, especially with what happened with covid
1835060	1840140	because most of most of them were involved with all these controversies
1840340	1846380	regarding the lockdowns as in the midst of covid, the lockdowns, the vaccinations.
1846580	1852140	And they would agree that science isn't this
1852340	1856620	entity, let's say, that you could just detach or science isn't this thing that
1856820	1860660	can just plainly be detached from the rest of society.
1860860	1865300	And from our, from our, let's say, our perspectives.
1865500	1867820	I don't know if anything really
1868020	1871620	being a human being, you know, this is again, Nietzsche's perspectivism.
1871820	1873620	Being a human being, I don't know if you can really
1873820	1875580	detach anything from a perspective.
1875780	1878100	So from a from the context, from a social context.
1878300	1883420	And this, again, is something I've truly begun to appreciate about postmodernist
1883620	1887700	that kind of skepticism, even though I understand that can easily become
1887740	1889220	a cynicism.
1889420	1891980	And that certainly isn't what I'm trying to do here,
1892180	1896220	even though maybe sometimes in this article, David has become a bit cynical,
1896220	1896820	but that's fine.
1897020	1898740	You know, we all can become,
1898940	1903380	life is tough, being cynical sometimes is warranted.
1903580	1907980	So the section that we're going to get to right now is the
1908180	1912580	incommensurability of Marxism and postmodernism.
1912780	1917380	The point David makes is simply it's wrong to claim postmodernists are
1917460	1919260	Marxists in disguise.
1919460	1922260	It's too simplistic and it's a lazy argument.
1922460	1924500	And David pointed out in this article,
1924700	1930140	Clare Hemmings problem problematizes this approach to postmodernism and Marxism
1930340	1932740	by emphasizing some of the most significant
1932940	1936220	differences between the two theoretical frameworks.
1936420	1941500	She writes that postmodernism's attention to complexity of meaning and
1941500	1947780	interpretation distracted us from the most substantive concerns with inequality,
1947980	1953780	experience, political economy and justice that Marxism attains to.
1953980	1958900	Hemmings extends this analysis by suggesting that without a Marxist or
1959100	1962300	other tangible approach to critical theory,
1962500	1966820	we remain powerless to alter the pernicious
1966980	1971940	power relations or poststructuralist tactics can cleverly identify,
1972140	1974620	but spectacularly fail to transform.
1974820	1981540	Hemmings's point stresses the lack of consistency between Marxist and poststructuralists theories,
1981740	1988220	demonstrating their fundamental incongruency in the domain of political action.
1988420	1993740	With the former emphasizing a radical transformation of capitalism into a
1993860	1999740	socialist system and the latter belonging to the domain of theory interested in the
1999940	2004140	immaterial conditions of signification.
2004340	2010940	What I got from this parallel was, you know, in a very colloquial sense, let's say,
2011140	2014940	Marxism is predominantly a call to political and social action.
2015140	2018140	You know, that's what the communist manifesto is pretty much is,
2018140	2022220	even though I'm not reducing Marxism just to the communist manifesto, certainly not.
2022420	2028900	But it seems clear to me, at least, as a, again, a layperson on your side,
2029100	2032900	that Marxism is clearly a call to action.
2033100	2037540	Anyone who, in my opinion, is a Marxist is sort of
2037740	2040940	is a concomitantly an activist.
2041140	2043500	There's no,
2043700	2046500	in my opinion, these come together,
2046700	2052060	the couple, let's say, whereas postmodernism and poststructuralism is very much
2052260	2057620	a theory, it's against what Clare Hemings writes about,
2057820	2061100	identifies here of it being
2061300	2065100	the importance of context, the depths and layers of meaning, all of that.
2065300	2068300	So it's breaking down language.
2068500	2070180	So it is different.
2070380	2075580	One can't just, again, as I said, prima facie attribute a postmodernist to also be
2075780	2081020	a Marxist or put it in a Petersonian way to say that postmodernism is a slight
2081060	2083580	of hand for Marxism.
2083780	2088060	And then David writes on Jean Baudrillard.
2088260	2094420	Jean Baudrillard referred to by some as the high priest of postmodernism is one
2094620	2101980	such figure that greatly disturbs Peterson's conflation of Marxist and postmodern theories.
2102180	2108220	In the mirror of production, Baudrillard vehemently challenges Marxism asking,
2108420	2114060	are we quite simply within a mode of production at all?
2114260	2117340	And have we ever been in one?
2117540	2122900	Baudrillard extends this question by turning his critical gaze back on Marxism,
2123100	2128180	suggesting that Marxism is predicated on the fundamentally, this is an important
2128380	2133300	point, on the fundamentally Eurocentric tenants of Productivism,
2133420	2140060	scientism and historicism, and that it homogenizes
2140260	2147220	earlier societies under the light of the present structure of the capitalist economy.
2147420	2152340	Therefore, silencing specific socio-historical contexts,
2152540	2157580	projecting onto them the spectral light of political economy.
2157780	2160380	Oh, that was a bit dense.
2160660	2164060	This book marked a fundamental turning point
2164260	2169820	in Baudrillard's work as he grew wary of the possibility that Marxism could
2170020	2175180	actually provide the blueprints for an effective mode of societal change.
2175380	2181420	I would say as much as as much as as much of an anti-capitalist that I've become,
2181620	2186900	and especially in the past, say, years, so I've truly seen a lot of loopholes
2187020	2190820	and a lot of problems with modernity and capitalism.
2191020	2194940	The reason I'm still not a Marxist or I probably will never be one is because
2195140	2201540	of this coin David makes, but only Baudrillard makes, that
2201740	2203140	they're too materialistic.
2203340	2209060	For me, Marxism is too, it's too contemporary in that sense.
2209260	2210860	It's too ephemeral.
2211060	2216020	It doesn't look into the deeper realities of society and being human.
2216220	2219260	And again, it's too.
2220700	2224180	It's too, let's say, you know, I mean, there's even a term called scientific.
2224380	2227500	Is it called scientific socialism or scientific utopianism?
2227700	2233660	So a lot of it's heavily influenced by this post enlightenment kind of thought.
2233860	2237340	And it it tends to ignore so much.
2237340	2240660	And I want to mean it, I should say it's this is both capitalism and Marxism
2240860	2245020	tends to ignore human psychology, culture, sociology.
2245300	2253060	Therefore, Baudrillard makes a brilliant, perspicacious point here that
2253260	2256460	shouldn't shouldn't we be a bit critical of these
2256660	2258940	prescriptions we are making on society.
2259140	2261940	And we're saying that this will work.
2262140	2265260	And then David makes a comment on Foucault
2265460	2270260	in the order of things he systematically, when you mean he is Michel Foucault,
2270460	2274980	in the order of things he systematically avoids discussing Marxism.
2275180	2281140	In terms of economic theory in favor of many other liberal approaches to economics
2281340	2285900	indicative of the work of Adam Smith and Francois Canet.
2286100	2288740	Foucault does this because as he makes
2288940	2294100	abundantly clear, he believes that Marxism exists in 19th century thought
2294300	2299100	like a fish in water, that that is, it is unable to breathe anywhere else.
2299300	2302500	Foucault might the point that I was trying to make before in a much better way.
2302780	2305780	This is exactly what I was trying to say.
2305980	2310820	This sentiment resonates in harmony with the overarching themes
2311020	2316260	of his work, because he refuses to acknowledge that societal ills or power
2316460	2320140	can be reduced to a single structural locus.
2320340	2325340	What I read this point for a moment, I thought this was Peterson writing because
2325540	2330740	Peterson has made strikingly similar points to that which Foucault makes,
2330780	2336020	especially when he speaks of ideology, that the fragment can replace the whole,
2336220	2340220	that ideology only sees part of the picture.
2340420	2346780	So in that sense, Peterson would 100 percent agree with Foucault here.
2346980	2352060	Well, not 100 percent, because, you know, nothing works in absolutes.
2352260	2354180	But the point I'm trying to make is that
2354380	2358980	good heavens, Peterson certainly has made very similar points.
2359180	2360780	And back to what David's saying,
2360980	2365500	thus Foucault is highly skeptical of the possibility of a meaningful societal
2365700	2370500	revolution, because without a comprehensive evaluation of the plethora
2370700	2375940	of institutions that govern our daily lives, we risk perpetuating the same
2376140	2378580	oppressive schema.
2378780	2380980	And here, David makes a really interesting point.
2381180	2384180	He says, the thinkers that Peterson cites as
2384300	2389060	representatives of postmodern movement, Michel Foucault and Jacques Dorida,
2389260	2393820	were greatly indebted to the Western philosophical and literary canons,
2394020	2398300	with some commentators even labeling them neocontents.
2398500	2403780	Peterson's reduction of these thinkers to philosophical aberrations
2403980	2411180	detached from Western civilization, illuminates his obliviousness to said canon.
2411380	2415380	Great point by David here, a very important one in this article, because
2415580	2421420	this conversation Peterson had with Camille Parglayer perfectly illustrates
2421620	2424620	what David's saying here, because you can clearly see
2424820	2429740	both of them, Parglayer and Peterson, are being very dismissive of these
2429940	2433420	French intellectuals, saying that they didn't read the classics, that they weren't
2433620	2437380	well read in the Western canon, they were uneducated.
2437580	2440460	But good heavens, I mean,
2440740	2444900	maybe this is just my own ignorance and my lack of,
2445100	2447380	let's say, proper academic training.
2447580	2454420	But when I read some of, you know, I've only mostly read Sartre and Foucault.
2454620	2457140	I don't get the impression at all that
2457340	2461580	they're uneducated or that they haven't read enough Western philosophy, because
2461780	2465780	they seem deeply well read scholars.
2465780	2471460	And I don't think in any way one could say that their aberrations to Western
2471660	2474780	philosophy, in many ways,
2475660	2478900	as David points out, they seem to be continuing on.
2479100	2484140	I'm not saying it's just them, but they seem to be continuing on the Kantian project.
2484340	2489620	You know, all the way from Kant to Heidegger to whatever is going to come up now.
2489820	2493860	And I don't think the aberrations in that in that case.
2493940	2498140	And this conversation Peterson had with Pogliac just demonstrate,
2498340	2503820	I wouldn't say, like, I think the point David makes, he eliminates his own obliviousness
2504020	2507980	to said canon, that might be a bit unfair, but it just
2508180	2511820	demonstrate that deep visceral hatred
2512020	2518180	Peterson has for these French intellectuals by being sort of casually dismissive of them.
2518380	2520980	And then we get to another
2521100	2524100	very important point, and especially a point that I really enjoyed.
2524300	2529460	Not point a part of the essay that I really enjoyed, especially given my recent
2529660	2532900	let's call it an amulement with Hannah Arendt's work.
2533100	2539140	It's the section Peterson, Aaron and totalitarianism.
2539340	2543300	Peterson doesn't seem to mention Hannah Arendt much in his work.
2543500	2547100	Yes, he just speak a lot about totalitarianism for sure.
2547100	2548540	I mean,
2548740	2552820	maps of meaning was pretty much all about Peterson trying to understand,
2553020	2558820	you know, not the Nazis and totalitarianism and tyranny and all of that.
2559020	2563860	But rarely does he mention Hannah Arendt, which is quite surprising, as David points out.
2564060	2569260	He says, what is particularly striking is that Peterson makes no significant use
2569460	2575980	of Hannah Arendt, the think of fascism and totalitarianism by excellence.
2576100	2577820	I agree.
2578020	2583300	He just mentioned her briefly, however, suggesting that her seminal text, a text,
2583500	2585900	the banality of evil,
2586100	2590780	would have better been more appropriately titled The Evil of Banality.
2590980	2595420	In fact, let me find that quote so that, you know, we don't want to
2595620	2599540	give the impression that David's quoting Peterson out of context here.
2599740	2600940	It's 269.
2600940	2605860	I could quickly find the quote because I was going through this few days ago.
2606060	2609500	Peterson writes, nonetheless,
2609700	2612860	we are more than we see
2613060	2617940	and are more trouble than we imagine when undisciplined and unrealized.
2618140	2621060	The banality of evil, Hannah Arendt's
2621260	2627740	famous phrase applied to the often unprecessing Nazi personality,
2627860	2631380	is more accurately the evil of banality.
2631580	2638180	Our petty weaknesses accumulate and multiply and become the great evils of state.
2638380	2641020	As our technological power expands,
2641220	2646820	the danger we pose increases and the consequences of our voluntary stupidity
2647020	2653140	multiply is increasingly necessary that we set ourselves, not others, right.
2653340	2656460	And that we learn explicitly what that means.
2656580	2659260	Yes. So again, this is Peterson from 1999,
2659460	2666060	and he still very much talks and writes in similar prose and similar themes.
2666260	2669340	So again, the part I'm trying to make is David
2669540	2675020	had hasn't misquoted him in any way or quoted him out of context.
2675220	2680740	The absence of Aaron's work in Peterson's exploration of these themes is suspicious
2680940	2685980	and signals that his understanding of totalitarianism is missing integral
2686100	2689540	philosophical insight, perhaps true.
2689740	2692780	This is particularly true of the lineage he
2692980	2697260	traces between nihilism and the development of totalitarianism.
2697460	2701380	So another bit of an experiment I did was I went on incognito.
2701580	2704860	I had to and I googled
2705060	2707660	just plainly Jordan Peterson and Hannah Aaron.
2707860	2712300	And I wanted to see if there was anything that involved
2712420	2715860	Peterson talking about Hannah Aaron, and I couldn't find anything not in his
2716060	2719340	writing, not in his lectures. So if it is right here, in fact,
2719340	2722740	the only thing I found was this reddit thread of another person asking
2722940	2727620	on the Jordan Peterson subreddit, is anyone here familiar with Hannah Aaron?
2727820	2730940	Because both Peterson and Hannah Aaron seem to be
2731140	2736700	in the deepest possible way trying to understand totalitarianism.
2736700	2740140	Maybe Peterson, more from a psychological perspective, and Hannah Aaron,
2740180	2742940	more from a sociological and philosophical perspective.
2743140	2749260	But I would certainly imagine Peterson bringing up in more of his lectures.
2749460	2751940	So that is the point to keep in mind.
2752140	2755900	And just a completely ancillary point here.
2756100	2762820	I think what really turned me to Hannah Aaron's work again was David for sure.
2763020	2768340	But in particular, it was this series David did.
2768540	2770900	Hannah Aaron's The Origins of Totalitarianism.
2771100	2774780	In fact, I ordered the book and it's on its way.
2774980	2776780	I thought Amazon Prime was much faster,
2776980	2779180	but they're taking like weeks to build the book.
2779380	2780260	Doesn't matter.
2780460	2783980	But I want to this is going to be the next book that I read.
2784180	2786100	It's on my list because
2786300	2789220	this series David did, it was amazing.
2789420	2793340	I learned so much and I had to I had to read the book.
2793540	2795260	There was no question about it because
2795380	2801620	David converted me into an erudite, erudite.
2801820	2804060	Anyway,
2804260	2808700	and this leads to an interesting point, interesting
2808900	2810660	two, two, two views here, isn't it?
2810860	2815540	There's the Hannah Aaron view of the strong man, Nazi personality.
2815740	2821260	And then there's a Peterson view of the of our individual moral failings
2821460	2825140	that that causes nihilism and that causes the state to become corrupt.
2825340	2826620	So
2826820	2828820	how do we reconcile these two views?
2829020	2829580	I don't know.
2829580	2835420	I don't think David is set in the article, but he does point out some
2835620	2838540	contradictory points between Hannah Aaron's views,
2838740	2843700	where she took a much more critical philosophical lens and viewed what happened
2843900	2849660	in the 20th century and then Pearson's views that he portrays more in detail in
2849860	2852020	maps of meaning. Here's what David writes.
2852340	2855860	This idea of of of indifference and
2856060	2861180	apathy that Peterson says is what causes totalitarianism versus,
2861380	2863140	let's say,
2863340	2868780	taking upon responsibility, being the ubermensch or a saviour sometimes
2868980	2873620	and understanding that we play a role in the
2873820	2877860	in the birth or the imbuement of totalitarian
2877900	2883940	totalitarian states or personality or individuals or tyrants.
2884140	2887300	So David writes, sorry, I was very
2887500	2890140	inarticulate and trying to make that point.
2890340	2891780	I'm still learning apologies.
2891980	2897460	But David writes, as Hannah Aaron argues in the origins of totalitarianism,
2897660	2900220	that what is hard to pronounce?
2900420	2901940	It's kind of a mouthful.
2902140	2904260	Indifference to public affairs and new
2904340	2909580	gravity on political issues are in themselves no sufficient cause for the
2909780	2911820	rise of totalitarian movements.
2912020	2917140	According to Aaron, it is the strong man rather than the indifferent public that
2917340	2922060	has historically led to the rise of totalitarian regimes.
2922260	2928900	As she explains, competitive and hostile attitudes are very useful for those forms
2929100	2933940	of dictatorship in which a strong man takes upon himself the troublesome
2933940	2940140	responsibility for the conduct of public affairs and hardly conforms to traditional
2940340	2943300	or typical definitions of nihilism.
2943500	2944420	This is the point.
2944620	2945380	This is the point.
2945380	2947300	This is an important point because clearly,
2947500	2950700	Peterson talks a lot about taking upon
2950900	2956020	carrying your own yoke to put it in Christian parlance or taking upon the world's
2956220	2961780	burdens onto oneself and then sort of being a saviour.
2961980	2966980	That in in in contrast to, let's say, apathy or indifference.
2967180	2972860	Now, Aaron says, actually, no, indifference and apathy isn't the reason that
2973060	2977820	totalitarianism permeates and rises.
2978020	2984780	It's rather it's this strong man, Nietzschean, ubermunch kind of personality.
2984980	2986700	I don't know what to make of it.
2986860	2991740	Firstly, I haven't read this book, even though I listen to David's lecture.
2991940	2993580	So I want to first read the book.
2993780	2996420	Maybe then I have a better idea.
2996620	3001060	But it certainly is something to think about, because I certainly
3001260	3005020	I most most definitely can see how
3005220	3011620	that idea of I think Nietzsche calls it injecting meaning into one's veins,
3011780	3015580	where that idea of being this
3015780	3018660	hyper disciplined, sort of aesthetic
3018860	3022980	individual who takes upon responsibility and
3023180	3029780	and has orders, hyper conscientious, how that can very easily become a peculiar kind
3029980	3035460	of hubristic, almost narcissistic
3035660	3040180	way to become a strong man and then an eventual tyrant or totalitarian, at least
3040180	3044460	psychologically, I can see how that can manifest in someone in like a sort of
3044660	3045700	like a psychic state.
3045900	3050220	And I would even say, maybe I've even seen that in some people.
3050420	3052020	Maybe even myself, who knows?
3052220	3053620	But
3053820	3056780	Hannah Aaron's point, it should be taken to heart.
3056980	3058060	It's a good point.
3058260	3061940	And David just laid out well here.
3062140	3065900	And then he gets to an interesting point here on essentialism, this idea that there
3065900	3070780	are essential, essential, there's an essential nature to being human, which to
3070980	3077380	some extent, I still believe I'm not a complete, in that sense, anti-essentialist.
3077580	3079580	But David writes,
3079780	3083900	Aaron's description of the strong man has founded upon the belief in a kind of
3084100	3089660	human nature, which would be subject to the same laws of growth as that of the
3089660	3096220	individual shares a strong affinity with Peterson's persistent reliance on
3096420	3100540	essentialist positions as illustrated in statements about
3100740	3104180	essential female and masculine pathologies.
3104380	3107180	Aaron elaborates on these essentialist
3107380	3112220	beliefs as irrelevant since Western philosophy and religion has been defining
3112420	3115620	and redefining it for more than 3,000 years.
3115780	3121060	Now, while it's true, this idea of redefining and defining, I would say,
3121260	3124140	and again, this is completely an intuition.
3124340	3127940	I have no firstly
3128140	3132660	verbal majority, but also real,
3132860	3137380	let's say, sociological and anthropological
3137580	3139380	evidence to back up this claim.
3139580	3144380	But I do feel intuitively when I look at many cultures and when I even just read
3144420	3149900	about cultures and even experience some cultures, there always seems to be
3150100	3154700	this kind of masculine and feminine, not and again, it's not a male-female thing,
3154900	3160020	because a man could be feminine and masculine both and the other way around.
3160220	3162860	So it's not really
3165260	3169420	a biological distinction, even though the biological distinction exists.
3169420	3173500	What I'm trying to say is this idea of the
3173700	3177220	of kind of an essential feminine and masculine spirit, let's say.
3177420	3182660	It does seem I don't know if it's fair to say that that doesn't exist at all,
3182860	3186940	because one could see it in so many different cultures all across the world.
3187140	3192860	And if something is that common, isn't that maybe pointing towards some kind
3193060	3195500	of deep truth? Who knows?
3195700	3197420	But again,
3197620	3201460	the point, David's the more deeper point David's trying to make here is that
3201660	3205860	that that attitude of essentialism could lead to
3206060	3210340	this totalitarian kind of mindset where you say, this is the way things should be
3210540	3214300	done, this absolutist,
3214500	3219220	almost despotic attitude that this is the way this should be done.
3219420	3221180	So that certainly begs the question.
3221180	3224740	And David doesn't really point this out in the article, but this is exactly what
3224780	3227020	I was thinking while I was reading it is,
3227220	3229900	is how do we properly take Peterson's,
3230100	3234500	this adopt responsibility or personal responsibility mantra too hard,
3234700	3236660	which I think is a good message.
3236860	3243140	But how do we prevent it from being pathologized as a drive to be a totalitarian?
3243340	3244980	Because
3245180	3247660	and this is something I realized recently,
3247860	3252580	enlargement thinking, we like to think that it was all about freedom and liberty
3252780	3253820	and equality.
3254020	3257820	But no, it certainly had an absolutist attitude towards it.
3258020	3260020	You know, Hobbes, for example.
3260220	3263660	So there were many enlightenment thinkers who were absolutist.
3263860	3268700	And more importantly, the deeper point is the idea of there being, let's say,
3268700	3272300	categories and that is essential, this attitude of enlightenment thinking
3272500	3277460	that can be certainly connected or even imbue
3277580	3281140	tyrannical, totalitarian sort of thinking.
3281340	3282820	So
3283020	3285020	it's how do we delineate that?
3285220	3288020	And it's very it's very nuanced there.
3288220	3292020	And I really didn't think of this until
3292220	3294380	maybe one or two years ago.
3294580	3296380	So
3296580	3299780	something to ponder and reflect on.
3299980	3301740	And now we get to the most,
3301940	3306340	in my opinion, the part I like the most and the most interesting part of the article,
3306380	3310180	especially because I'm a Nietzschean and and the more I read Nietzsche,
3310380	3314300	the more I thought, oh, Peterson's, there's something if people don't
3314500	3318980	read Nietzsche and listen to Peterson lecture on Nietzsche,
3319180	3322260	they'd get a completely different picture on who Nietzsche is.
3322460	3325180	But in any case, I am a Nietzschean and I really like this part.
3325380	3327380	And I thought David made some good points.
3327580	3332380	So the question is, is Peterson misappropriating Nietzsche?
3332580	3334460	What I mean by this is I'm not saying
3334460	3338980	Peterson is misquoting or quoting man of context or trying to,
3339180	3345580	yeah, intentionally misappropriate him with some kind of
3345780	3350780	underlying motive, unethical underlying motive, not at all.
3350980	3353900	But sometimes because like all of us,
3354100	3356420	Peterson's got his own ideology.
3356620	3360660	I'm wondering if what he's really doing is just taking something Nietzsche said
3360860	3364020	and just fitting it into his philosophy, his ideology.
3364020	3367700	And then, you know, sharing it with the public.
3367900	3369700	Whereas
3369900	3371980	this isn't what Nietzsche would say.
3372180	3377260	So as in this synthesis, let's say, of taking what Nietzsche said and
3377460	3381940	synthesizing it along with what Peterson's saying and whatever that result is,
3382140	3384980	Nietzsche would completely disagree with what the result is.
3385180	3390140	He would be totally opposed to Nietzsche's overall philosophy,
3390340	3393660	even though Nietzsche hasn't really got one set philosophy.
3393900	3396180	And I think he did that intentionally.
3396380	3399180	So there is one has to be careful.
3399380	3402380	One has to be careful when when they
3402580	3407620	try to understand Nietzsche through a Petersonian lens, let's say.
3407820	3409980	David writes,
3410180	3415100	in the birth of tragedy, Nietzsche argues that the notion of truth that runs
3415300	3419500	through the course of history, history, the course of history,
3419700	3424140	are founded not on their object, objectivity, but in their
3424340	3427900	continual self proclamation of objectivity.
3428100	3432580	For Nietzsche, the shift from language to science plays a scientific method at
3432780	3435380	the forefront of Western civilization,
3435580	3439540	making everything quantifiable under the scientific gaze.
3439740	3445940	As he explains, it is language which works on building the edifice of concepts.
3446140	3448300	Later, it is science.
3448420	3452580	Nietzsche expands on this idea of writing.
3452780	3457260	What I understand about the spirit of science is the belief which first came to
3457460	3462620	light in the person of Socrates, that the depths of nature can be fathomed
3462820	3466340	and that knowledge can heal all ills.
3466540	3472860	According to Nietzsche, this belief in the ultimate infallibility of science or
3473060	3476100	Socrates's tendency to murder are
3476340	3480300	is destructive, especially when left unacknowledged.
3480500	3483820	Now, Peterson here would certainly agree with this point, because
3484020	3487500	I've listened to a couple of interviews where Peterson comments on Stephen
3487700	3492740	Pinker's Enlightenment Now, and he pretty much says that he's quite
3492940	3495900	disappointed that in Enlightenment Now,
3496100	3501060	Stephen Pinker has all these chapters dedicated to the scientific method,
3501060	3503380	Enlightenment, freedom, democracy, all that.
3503580	3506900	And a little chapter towards the latter part of the book.
3506900	3511460	I haven't read the book, so I'm not really sure, even though I think I've got a copy.
3512340	3514700	Where he dedicates to the arts and the humanities.
3514700	3517820	And he says that that's unfortunate, because really it should be the other way
3518020	3524260	around, because most of life or most of what we are is, let's say,
3524460	3527300	we should be indebted to the arts and the humanities.
3527500	3530940	And science is very, very much a new phenomenon.
3531020	3534060	It's a new thing in our society.
3534260	3536780	Therefore, it is a good point.
3536980	3542060	To Nietzsche, science is truly capable of confining the individual within the
3542260	3544780	smallest circle of solvable tasks.
3544980	3550100	As he explains, science, spurred on by its powerful delusion,
3550300	3556020	is hurrying unstoppable to its limits, where the optimism hidden in the essence
3556220	3560300	of logic will founder and break up.
3560980	3563740	So then we get to Nietzsche versus 12 Rules for Life.
3563740	3567500	And this is kind of the point I made when I started commenting on the section
3567700	3573260	where if Nietzsche read 12 Rules for Life, he probably disagreed with most of it.
3573460	3575900	And David explains why.
3576100	3580420	12 Rules for Life proclaiming the necessity for people, young men.
3580620	3585780	I want to say, you know, David's put this in here kind of as like a slight comment,
3585980	3589580	you know, kind of being dismissive that all Peterson only caters to this certain
3589580	3595020	demographic, it seems like a straw man and a ad hominem attack.
3595220	3601260	Because firstly, ad hominem as if helping young men makes him a particular evil person.
3601260	3603860	I mean, I don't see what's wrong with helping young men.
3604060	3606260	You know, if people need help, people should get help.
3606460	3607380	I'm a young man.
3607580	3611860	And when I was 20, 21, reading Jordan Peterson's book helped me a lot.
3612060	3613980	It gave me structure and meaning and purpose.
3614180	3615140	And those things matter.
3615340	3616460	Life is difficult.
3616660	3619460	And I'm truly grateful for that.
3619660	3623500	And other than that, Peterson,
3623700	3628780	I know a lot of, in fact, a lot of the people that I know who are Jordan Peterson fans,
3628980	3632340	let's say, are women.
3632540	3637580	Funny enough, one of my good friends, she and I, we'll be going to the
3637780	3641820	Jordan Peterson comes to Melbourne, he's visiting Melbourne at the end of the yard
3642020	3644620	and we bought tickets for his kind of talk.
3644820	3646100	And I'll be going with him.
3646300	3647980	She really, she loves Jordan Peterson.
3647980	3653020	So I don't know if it's fair that, you know, it's it's sort of like a straw man
3653220	3658180	and a hominem and also, frankly, such slight comments seem unproductive.
3658180	3659260	I mean, such a good article.
3659460	3661620	And it's just saying young men as if it's a bad thing.
3661820	3667420	It cheapens and reduces this well written article to that of a
3667620	3670780	headpiece by some corporate media journalists.
3670780	3671980	And that's unfortunate.
3671980	3675100	But anyway, it's just a little bit of criticism that I had,
3675220	3679020	a little bit of criticism that I have.
3679220	3680020	So I'll get back to it.
3680220	3684340	Twirlers for life proclaiming the necessity for people to adopt an aesthetic
3684540	3689500	lifestyle in the form of a mutated Christian conservatism, conservatism,
3689700	3695980	stands diametrically opposed to Nietzsche's central claim in the genealogy of morality,
3696180	3703540	that the aesthetic ideal is not something to strive for, but rather it is the consequence
3703780	3709580	of a life attempting to inject artificial meaning into its veins in a poor attempt
3709780	3714700	at inoculation from degeneration.
3714900	3722060	In this capacity, Peterson resembles the ascetic priest that Nietzsche castigates.
3722260	3728060	The task of intellectual should should not be to inject arbitrary rules and
3728060	3731900	regulations into people, but rather to foster
3732100	3738140	a spectacular scene that welcomes more eyes, various eyes,
3738340	3744260	we are able to use to sketch a more complete understanding of our objectivity.
3744460	3745420	Superlative point.
3745620	3751620	In my opinion, this little para here or this little part sentence, let's say,
3751820	3753980	it's the best sentence in the whole article.
3754100	3758260	Really good point, because it's something I began to realize,
3758460	3766180	maybe again, two or three years ago, because I saw that in our new age
3766380	3771700	entrenched culture, it seems like every public intellectual is becoming a self
3771700	3774540	help guru, and that's kind of unfortunate because there's nothing wrong with self
3774740	3778100	help, but we should understand that everything has its place.
3778300	3781020	Self help should be separated from
3781220	3785300	intellectualism and public or public intellectuals, because it seems like
3785500	3789860	you know, a lot of even the Sam Harris, you know, he's got meditation and mindfulness.
3790060	3793340	A lot of public intellectuals have just become self help gurus,
3793540	3797380	kind of the celebrity self self help gurus, and that's unfortunate because the
3797580	3801940	what intellectual, in my opinion, should do is not reaffirm what you already believe.
3802140	3807540	But yes, as David beautifully puts it, it clearly points out.
3808340	3812140	Really make us feel uncomfortable in our beliefs, make us make us completely
3812340	3815740	change our perspectives and view the world in different lenses and give us
3815940	3823980	kind of perspectival seeing Adorno had a great quote, I think, in a aesthetic theory.
3824180	3829740	I'm completely paraphrasing here, but he says and he's talking about art here.
3829940	3835180	He says, Adorno, that the real purpose of art should be to.
3835420	3837140	Sort of.
3837340	3840700	I can't really remember the quote, but the idea is the purpose of art should be
3840700	3847420	to make us feel uncomfortable, to challenge our dogmas, our pre-health beliefs and really.
3847620	3853060	You know, lift, change our life radically and fundamentally in how we view the world.
3853260	3855620	And in my opinion, that's also what a public
3855820	3858580	intellectual should do, not become a self help guru.
3858780	3861220	And if they want to become self help guru, there's nothing wrong with that.
3861420	3862540	That's that's OK.
3862740	3864660	But then there's something else.
3864740	3867860	They're not a public intellectual or an intellectual for that matter.
3868060	3873260	So this is probably the best point David makes in the whole article.
3873460	3877580	Peterson's project is that is an attempt then to move away from the Nietzsche
3877780	3883460	notion of perspectival scene toward the domain of a historical, a contextual scene.
3883660	3888500	This narrowing of possibility operates to maintain the authority of those who choose
3888700	3893660	what is considered worth seeing and through that through and through what needs
3893860	3896580	pushing society towards sovereign and
3896780	3900260	the tutorial rule. Again, this last bit here
3900460	3905860	is quite apt to the whole covid lockdown controversy debate that a lot of people
3906060	3909060	got got into in the intellectual dark web.
3909260	3911980	I'm using that as an umbrella term
3912180	3915940	for like the Peterson's and the Sam Harris's.
3916140	3917860	That's again, that idea of perspectival
3918060	3918820	thing is quite important here.
3919020	3923420	So then we get to the section where it's the science versus Peterson.
3924380	3926580	And then David comments on
3926780	3934660	some of the Aristotelian notions of science.
3934860	3936940	He writes,
3937140	3941860	though Peterson's line of argumentation seems to suggest a science postmodernism
3942060	3947260	opposition, a considerable number of scientific journals have published articles
3947300	3953700	addressing the growing stigmatization and discrimination, trans and gender
3953900	3956900	queer people experience regularly.
3957100	3957900	It's a good point.
3958100	3961780	A lot of us don't spend the time to go and read up on these articles,
3961980	3966500	but there certainly is a a good amount of literature that probably uses the
3966700	3969020	scientific method to point this out.
3969220	3969860	So it is true.
3970060	3973060	There is that stigmatization
3973260	3976860	within trans people, especially maybe because it's now it's become a lot more
3976860	3979500	political. And that's quite unfortunate.
3979700	3982020	That is that is deep.
3982220	3983740	I hate saying that's quite that's quite
3983740	3986260	unfortunate because it's like a throwaway term for everything these days.
3986460	3989180	But that's that's a that's a sad truth.
3989380	3992380	And we should think about that.
3992580	3994980	We should think about that.
3995180	3998180	Such articles, though they conform to the same
3998380	4005420	scientific rationale utilized by Peterson, shed light on the great deal of contradictions,
4005620	4011940	oppositions and diversion, believes in this supposedly objective field of study.
4012140	4013580	This is an important point David makes.
4013780	4018460	These studies correspond to the domain of research that aligns with the
4018660	4023020	Aristotelian Aristotelian, God, I can't pronounce that,
4023220	4028420	aligns with the Aristotelian maxim of phronesis, which may be understood as
4028620	4034860	fostering practical intellectual activity aimed at clarifying the problems
4035100	4041220	risks and possibilities we face as humans and society, societies.
4041420	4045420	This approach, although still immersed in the scientific tradition,
4045620	4052420	stands opposed to the other domain of Aristotelian reason of episteme
4052620	4056700	that proclaims the a priori nature of scientific knowledge.
4056900	4058700	So this again kind of touches on that.
4058900	4062660	How do we derive Oates plainly from science?
4062860	4068980	Because it seems like the scientific institution itself is,
4069180	4073580	let's say, bifurcated into this phronesis and episteme.
4073780	4079980	And in many ways, phronesis does help us derive Oates,
4080180	4082820	but it is complicated because that also involves
4083020	4089620	contextual seeing, sociology, sociology, all of that.
4089780	4093340	This brand of research, while disavowed by Peterson,
4093540	4098060	presents a foray into the lives and experiences of marginalized groups
4098260	4102260	that would otherwise be silenced, absolutely.
4102460	4106700	And now another interesting point I would say from the whole article,
4106900	4112700	my favorite parts were Nietzsche and postmodernism and the
4112780	4115820	Baudrillard reality and truth.
4116020	4122460	Well worth a read, just just do those two parts.
4122660	4127660	The question asks the question that Baudrillard asks us, what is objective truth?
4127860	4132660	Job Baudrillard has vigorously challenged the position held by scholars such as
4132860	4138180	Peterson on objectivity and truth, suggesting instead that science like any
4138260	4144700	discourse is organized on the basis of a conventional logic,
4144900	4149620	adding that it explains things which have been defined
4149820	4156860	and formalized in advance, which subsequently conform to these explanations.
4157460	4160940	And again, Peterson would agree with this point because I've listened to his
4161140	4164540	conversations with recently Richard Dawkins and then Sam Harris,
4164540	4167780	where they get into the fact value distinction.
4167980	4174860	And again, one would assume that Peterson would find a certain
4175060	4180220	certain validity in what Baudrillard's pointing out here, because
4180420	4183660	in that sense, Richard Feynman, I'm I'm
4183860	4188660	connecting many figures here, Richard Feynman, probably my favorite scientist.
4188660	4190020	I love listening to his lectures.
4190020	4194820	He is actually wrong to say the philosophy of science is as useful to
4195020	4199060	scientists as ornithology is to birds.
4199260	4201780	That's that's a that's a wrong statement.
4201980	4204660	That's an invalid statement, in my opinion, because no, no, no,
4204860	4207500	the philosophy of science is a part of the scientific process.
4207700	4209500	It's a part of the scientific institution.
4209700	4215980	In many ways, it maybe is what this Aristotelian frenesis is about.
4216180	4222580	We need to understand what science is and how we make our presuppositions.
4222780	4225020	Oh, sorry, on what
4225220	4228860	on what presuppositions we start from, on what axioms.
4229060	4230700	And that's a good heavens.
4230900	4235900	That's probably that probably is the fundamental question of science these days.
4236100	4238340	How do we make our assumptions?
4238540	4240700	Where what's the starting point?
4240900	4244660	And again, I think apart from the conversations that I've
4244740	4249700	heard Peterson have, he probably understands that this problem inherently
4249900	4253100	exists in our modern conception of science.
4253300	4257460	It's probably why he's interested in Jung in archetypes and
4257660	4263100	Christian Neoplatonism, symbolism and in general, religious narrative,
4263300	4269140	because he sees those to be a sort of he sees that can be coupled with science
4269340	4274460	to find some kind of, let's say, objective starting point for science to work off.
4274660	4278980	And I don't know if that's possible, but it certainly at least points to the
4279180	4281180	problem or hints at the problem.
4281380	4286380	So David states, Baudrillard doesn't say that scientific conclusions are invalid.
4286580	4288500	He actually doesn't, I think.
4288700	4293900	I haven't read much Baudrillard, obviously, but I don't get that impression, at least.
4294100	4299300	But what he says very clearly is that whatever these scientific conclusions are,
4299340	4306620	these conclusions should not be transposed onto any societal or cultural context.
4307620	4313060	So these studies, some studies that he cited above in the article,
4313260	4318620	the studies speak to the late Baudrillard's conception of singularity.
4318820	4324740	OK, I'm going to say this is a part that I kind of am struggling to grok yet.
4324940	4327260	I still can't fathom it.
4327380	4331140	I don't know, for me, it still seems incomprehensible, but I think it's because I
4331340	4334700	haven't done enough reading, I haven't done enough studying to Baudrillard.
4334900	4337580	So David writes,
4337780	4344100	Baudrillard's conception of singularity, which holds that every detail of the world
4344300	4348260	is perfect if it is not referred to some larger set.
4348460	4354700	Reality for Baudrillard is always caught in a play of signification and suggestions
4354700	4359380	of a naturality made by the authoritative
4359580	4364420	scientific community, mistake the only true nature of the world as a world of
4364620	4371860	appearances in which there may not be anything but a discourse of the real and the rational.
4372060	4377340	Just a point here, the idea of I think this in many ways is the
4377540	4381220	scientific question. Oh, sorry, the philosophical question and the philosophical
4381220	4389620	battle that we've been having since time immorial, ever since Socrates, Plato, all that is.
4389820	4395300	In our epistemology, how do we know what's true and how do we know what's
4395500	4396700	appearing as true?
4396900	4401300	It seems to be the distinction between, let's say, the
4401500	4406900	the rationalist and the empiricists between the
4407180	4413700	Joan Locke and the David Hume or the continental philosophers and then the
4413900	4415780	English analytical philosophers.
4415980	4420020	How do we know what's true and what appears as true?
4420220	4424900	So that's such an important point and Baudrillard is,
4425100	4430100	in many ways, Baudrillard's working off that here.
4430300	4432740	According to Baudrillard,
4433020	4439580	then notions of an objective truth are fundamentally flawed and any attempt to occupy
4439780	4444700	an objective field of study is bound to fail and merely become
4444900	4450620	signs, signifiers of a real signified.
4450820	4454220	I hope there's a bit of a wordplay there, that's difficult to understand.
4454420	4458900	The fundamental impossibility of performing objective studies and or
4459060	4464580	revealing fundamental truths is understood by Baudrillard and his theory of simulation.
4464780	4470780	For Baudrillard, simulation occurs when the world has become real beyond our
4470980	4474180	wildest expectations
4474900	4478620	and can be described as the outcome of calculated
4478820	4482740	move to put the illusion of the world to death.
4482940	4490940	Scientific discourse that rely on notions on notions of objectivity and truth,
4491140	4497580	therefore dissolve into the imaginary of the sign or the sphere of truth
4497780	4503700	and leaves us with reality and therefore simulation in all its glory.
4503900	4509620	The real then is merely a particular case of that simulation that Baudrillard
4509700	4514820	argues, loves our society to think itself
4515020	4519340	and live itself as superior to all others.
4519540	4525220	Baudrillard's work can be read as not necessarily opposing the domain of scientific
4525420	4530140	inquiry, but accounting for the degree to which science,
4530340	4534980	but accounting for the degree to which any scientific inquiry should be attuned to
4535020	4540140	the cultural and significator conditions of the object of study.
4540340	4546140	So now here's where, again, I completely
4546340	4550580	attribute this to my lack of understanding, my lack of knowledge.
4550780	4554900	The reason I'm saying that is not for some kind of false modesty or false humility.
4555100	4558940	It's because genuinely, I haven't done enough study and reading.
4559140	4560700	This is in my field of study.
4560700	4565860	I haven't gone through the proper formal academic process of studying all its
4566060	4569300	philosophers, I'm a autodidact.
4569500	4572300	I'm doing it on my own.
4572500	4575420	But really, sometimes when I read these kind
4575620	4581260	of paragraphs, I do wonder, is this some kind of word game that these thinkers
4581460	4586900	are playing with their brilliant verbal and intellectual capabilities
4587100	4588300	with their ability to write?
4588420	4593100	And is it some kind of game?
4593300	4595980	I don't even mean game in a cynical way.
4596180	4599700	I mean, is it truly a way to try to
4599900	4605620	make some pre-held belief they have and try to make it look as if something
4605820	4611100	that's true about the world and make it cohere using language?
4611300	4617780	Is it is it a language game to sound with with with with with I don't know,
4617860	4622540	because, OK, when I read this, even though, as I said before, I don't fully
4622740	4627580	comprehend it or fully understand it, I certainly can see that it's it's
4627780	4635260	intimations of something true, something that's topically true about reality.
4635460	4643020	And it points to so many different domains of our current way of doing the world.
4643220	4646060	And for me, that coheres, even though what they're trying to say really doesn't
4646140	4647980	cohere, if that makes sense.
4648180	4651460	Like what I'm trying to say is sort of
4651660	4655340	it's a normatively some of what they're saying is like, oh, yeah, that I can see
4655540	4659300	how how they come to these conclusions.
4659500	4663900	OK, I don't know, just thinking out loud here, as I tend to do in this podcast.
4664100	4669460	And on the topic of not understanding things, I would say, again, not David's
4669660	4674980	fault, my own fault, my own ignorance, I truly thought it hard to understand this
4675100	4679580	section, Baudrillard Butler and those voices of the marginalized.
4679780	4682980	So that's about the whole essay.
4683180	4685660	That's about three or four paragraphs.
4685860	4690820	And here's the thing, I think part of it was because simply it's that section
4691020	4695860	of the essay about the gender controversy that I didn't really care that much to be
4696060	4700980	frank. And I think I just truly couldn't I couldn't penetrate it.
4701180	4701940	That's what it was.
4702100	4706020	It was the reason I found it a bit incomprehensible was because
4706220	4709980	I could see that David's making some important points here, but I couldn't.
4709980	4711340	I don't know. I didn't know why.
4711540	4715340	But for example, the previous points, even though there were parts of it that I
4715540	4719660	didn't really get, I at least I at least got the essence of his argument.
4719860	4723940	I was getting at where he was going to it.
4724140	4727060	But this section for me, I just couldn't I couldn't penetrate it.
4727100	4731900	And it it didn't click with me to put it plainly.
4732100	4734540	And apart from that,
4734740	4736900	this is just a complete personal thing.
4737100	4742860	I've recently been trying to study Heidegger, been trying to get through being in time.
4743060	4746620	Mate, I am eternally perplexed about everything.
4746620	4750780	I haven't really, if you can probably see from this podcast, I haven't got anything
4750980	4755620	substantial or coherent to say, but especially phenomenology, but virtually
4755620	4760100	anything because Heidegger has completely
4760300	4763780	overturned my views on so many things.
4763980	4765780	So
4765980	4768060	yeah, I'm in this place of this deep.
4768260	4772340	I'm I'm self I'm being extremely self critical of what I believe.
4772540	4777380	And I'm also very uncertain about virtually all my beliefs.
4777580	4782620	And that on that rather legubrious note, let's go to the conclusion.
4782820	4785380	But before I do read the conclusion, I want to say something.
4785540	4790180	Firstly, I want to say I think Peterson
4790380	4795540	totally deeply understands everything that David points out here, even though
4795740	4797780	he isn't very explicit about it.
4797980	4802580	He does get his he sees this inherent
4802780	4808300	income and stability between between what we have as modern science and how can we
4808500	4809820	derive values from it?
4809980	4814380	He sees the incomes, income and stability between what
4814580	4819260	modernity tells us and the deeper truth that postmodernist found this idea of
4819460	4824100	context, he's even said it in a couple of his podcasts that he does agree
4824300	4830140	with this notion of the complexity of interpretations and how much,
4830340	4834540	how deep that that really goes into reality in some sense, not just at,
4834740	4838820	let's say, at the level of text or hermeneutics, but that this this this
4839020	4841340	the problem of interpretation is a big problem.
4841540	4845940	And he points to AI researchers, he points to many, many places within the field
4846140	4848100	of science to to hit at that.
4848300	4849700	So I think he gets it.
4849900	4854580	And I would say it's because of that, maybe that I say that I,
4854780	4860100	apart from him as a person, but just at an intellectual, I began to admire him
4860300	4865020	a lot more because he's willing to publicly flesh out these ideas and make
4865020	4869580	mistakes publicly, especially someone like him who's got such public acclaim.
4869780	4874060	And, and, you know, because he gets himself in all his political controversies,
4874260	4878420	the moment he makes a mistake, he is hammered and he is,
4878620	4882580	is there always caving critiques written about him, which can be quite difficult
4882780	4883940	being a public figure.
4884140	4888300	One shouldn't just think that that's it's quite hard to go through that.
4888500	4890660	It's it's a lot of stress.
4890820	4896460	So I do admire that kind of courage that he has to publicly deal with these issues.
4896660	4898380	And
4898580	4902980	I I've got to say I am a bit disheartened that I
4903180	4908380	feel like with time, with his influence, he's becoming more and more ideological
4908580	4914860	and even a bit more dogmatic in his in his beliefs and his views, which for me
4915060	4920140	is unfortunate because then this project, he has to work this out to try and reconcile
4920220	4924540	these, if it's reconcilable, these
4924740	4927060	incumbents or abilities,
4927260	4931620	I feel like that then he won't have a genuine journey in doing that because if
4931820	4934780	he becomes more and more, let's say, dogmatic in his views,
4934980	4937780	I really hope that he doesn't go there.
4937980	4942700	But again, all the points David makes in this article, I think is very apt to who
4942900	4947220	Jordan Peterson is and I think he gets it.
4947460	4949980	Secondly, I want to say, David,
4950180	4953540	if you have, if you do watch this episode, I really hope you do.
4953740	4957460	I want to try and treat this at you a couple of times to to try and get your
4957660	4960940	attention. But if you do watch this episode and if you come this far,
4961140	4963860	mate, I know I'm very, very long winded.
4964060	4965260	It's a problem of mine.
4965460	4966620	I never get to the point.
4966820	4968820	But if you come this far, I would like to
4969020	4973420	sincerely invite you on the podcast for an interview because I would love to talk
4973420	4976580	to you and learn from you. I have so many questions.
4976780	4978940	I got to say, David, again,
4979140	4984180	not blowing steam up your ass, put it in a vulgar way.
4984380	4988540	You truly have been that kind of intellectual that you talk about this
4988740	4991020	part here about perspectival scene.
4991220	4995340	You probably are seeing right now me learning from you and trying to
4995540	5000620	try to see the world and see all these topics through different perspectives
5000660	5005100	and different views, because you foster that kind of perspective of seeing in me.
5005300	5009340	So and I'm a product of in that sense of your YouTube channel,
5009540	5013660	a living example, let's say, to put it in a dramatic way.
5013860	5019940	And again, your work on Hannah Irwin has made me fall in love with her in some sense.
5020140	5023500	Maybe, you know, in fact, maybe I should have you on the podcast if you do agree
5023700	5030580	that is, of course, after I'm done reading the origins of totalitarianism.
5030780	5033820	Because then I'll have something a bit more substantial to discuss with you.
5034020	5036620	But again, this is my invite to the podcast.
5036820	5044540	And on that note, I would read the conclusion to the article and end this episode.
5044740	5050540	Beyond locating the various contradictions and fallacious remarks Peterson makes,
5050740	5058340	this paper has also argued that Peterson's assault against Bill C-16 risks mirroring
5058420	5066140	the same systemic instantiations of totalitarianism that he claims to know so much about.
5066340	5068300	To reiterate,
5068500	5073060	this is not to suggest that he represents these movements directly,
5073260	5078540	but that there are many affinities between these oppressive ideological systems
5078740	5082180	and Peterson's faith in a universal conception of truth.
5082380	5084580	That's to a point.
5084820	5090100	This paper serves the purpose of mounting a philosophically analytical rebuttal
5090300	5096260	to Peterson's central claims by pointing an eminent critique.
5096460	5098940	Pointing to the many shortcomings of his
5099140	5105980	speculations and locating epistemic fallacies that may be observed in his ideas.
5106180	5111020	This is a necessary form of critique because unlike the Hegelian model of
5111180	5118300	oppositional politics that poses a critique from an antithetical and exterior
5118500	5124820	positionality, this form identifies the core of the theoretical inadequacy
5125020	5127300	of Peterson's project from the inside.
5127500	5129700	And I think, David, you accomplished that.
