Welcome. My name's David Wood and I'm here to talk about the case for singularity activism.
This is actually a version of a talk I gave a couple of days ago, on the 29th of April,
to a meeting of London Futurists at Birkbeck College. It was a well-received talk, but that
event was not recorded. So I'm now sharing an updated version of this talk, which in some ways
is improved, because it benefits from feedback during the meeting itself, more feedback during
the after the event discussion in a nearby pub, the Marlborough Arms, and yet more feedback which
I've received via email and social media. This topic of the singularity and singularity
activism is arguably the most important topic that London Futurists has ever discussed. Now,
we've discussed pop.
