Welcome. My name's David Wood and I'm here to talk about the case for singularity activism.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,920
This is actually a version of a talk I gave a couple of days ago, on the 29th of April,

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,640
to a meeting of London Futurists at Birkbeck College. It was a well-received talk, but that

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,480
event was not recorded. So I'm now sharing an updated version of this talk, which in some ways

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:40,160
is improved, because it benefits from feedback during the meeting itself, more feedback during

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,600
the after the event discussion in a nearby pub, the Marlborough Arms, and yet more feedback which

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:57,040
I've received via email and social media. This topic of the singularity and singularity

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:05,360
activism is arguably the most important topic that London Futurists has ever discussed. Now,

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,560
we've discussed pop.
