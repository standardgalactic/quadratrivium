0	12080	Welcome. My name's David Wood and I'm here to talk about the case for singularity activism.
12080	17920	This is actually a version of a talk I gave a couple of days ago, on the 29th of April,
17920	25640	to a meeting of London Futurists at Birkbeck College. It was a well-received talk, but that
25640	32480	event was not recorded. So I'm now sharing an updated version of this talk, which in some ways
32480	40160	is improved, because it benefits from feedback during the meeting itself, more feedback during
40160	47600	the after the event discussion in a nearby pub, the Marlborough Arms, and yet more feedback which
47600	57040	I've received via email and social media. This topic of the singularity and singularity
57040	65360	activism is arguably the most important topic that London Futurists has ever discussed. Now,
65360	66560	we've discussed pop.
