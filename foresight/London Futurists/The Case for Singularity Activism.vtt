Welcome. My name's David Wood and I'm here to talk about the case for singularity activism.

00:12.080 --> 00:17.920
This is actually a version of a talk I gave a couple of days ago, on the 29th of April,

00:17.920 --> 00:25.640
to a meeting of London Futurists at Birkbeck College. It was a well-received talk, but that

00:25.640 --> 00:32.480
event was not recorded. So I'm now sharing an updated version of this talk, which in some ways

00:32.480 --> 00:40.160
is improved, because it benefits from feedback during the meeting itself, more feedback during

00:40.160 --> 00:47.600
the after the event discussion in a nearby pub, the Marlborough Arms, and yet more feedback which

00:47.600 --> 00:57.040
I've received via email and social media. This topic of the singularity and singularity

00:57.040 --> 01:05.360
activism is arguably the most important topic that London Futurists has ever discussed. Now,

01:05.360 --> 01:06.560
we've discussed pop.
