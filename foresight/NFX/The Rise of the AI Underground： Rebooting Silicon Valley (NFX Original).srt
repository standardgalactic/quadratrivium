1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,600
You know, Silicon Valley has these boom and bust cycles, and Silicon Valley has these

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,000
boom and bust cycles. But now everyone's coming back. And it turns out that this area

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,280
in Hayes Valley, which is just sort of in the center of the San Francisco area, is being

4
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,720
a magnet for all this AI activity. It feels like people are talking again, they're meeting

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,760
again, they're having parties again. It's happening in person. And that really changes

6
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,080
things for people in terms of how fast they think, how they learn about KPIs, and that

7
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,560
sort of old magic that we had before seems to be coming back.

8
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,320
We have about 100 people out here today, after hours, after work hours, meeting up at Salesforce

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Park here, talking about the ChadGBT-4 usage that's not accessible through the ChadGBT-plus

10
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,200
subscription and some amplification with the research.

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,400
It's a San Francisco party, the attack just drops and we go for it.

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,800
Right now in the last six months while we've been watching this is the founders have jumped

13
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,840
on this new powerful engine. It's like someone gave them an internal combustion engine, and

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,840
they thought, now what can I do with this? And they've thought of cars, they've thought

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,240
of buses, they've thought of trucks, but everybody's thought of cars and buses. Everyone's come

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,840
up with the same ideas looking at these LLMs. Every month we get these things together because

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,200
we want you guys to become friends. And you're all here in the middle of it. So it's your

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,120
time to focus on your business ideas and to move as fast as you can and not to let up.

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,040
People ask me how big is this? And the context I like to look at it is that between 94 and

20
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,760
2020, we went through what we're calling the connecting, where we got the world connected

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,880
up on the internet, mobile phones, all these devices everywhere. And so now we've got 4 billion

22
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,560
people connected and eventually it'll be everybody on the planet. But that main 20 year, 25 year

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,800
period was when we connected the world and we were here for that. And now we're entering the

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,440
phase. What we're thinking of is the transition where we're going to be adding sort of silicon

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,080
based life to this planet. So we're carbon based life and this stuff is going to be thinking in,

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,800
I don't know, 80 years, 100 years, but this is the beginning of that phase where we actually see

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,840
software and silicon starting to do a lot of the cognitive work that humans have done in the past.

28
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,600
And that's now beginning. We can see it. We've been talking about it for 80 years,

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,360
but we can now see it. And this is when it just started. So it's a big deal. We're here for it.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,400
And now it's up to us to be the first people who start to get to build things with it.

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:03:13,000
And vision a world where people could just build shit

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,400
and not have to worry about anything else. And hackathons give that to you for a weekend. And

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,840
it's like, it's so good, but it's just a weekend and then it's over. And so I was constantly

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,000
trying to find like the next hackathon, the next hackathon, the next, and there weren't that many

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,040
back then. I started going to hackathons in like 2011. The vision that whole time was like

36
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,000
this world where you can just build and not have to worry about anything else. And that was the

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,320
birth of HF0. So the idea is that we create something where people never actually have to

38
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,800
leave or think about anything else. But when people are in this container and it's like they're

39
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,160
surrounded by other people who are pushing the limits of how fast you can move and what's possible

40
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,880
to build, like we just see founders move at a pace I've never seen before.

41
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,400
Or there are three floors here across the basement. We have like 16 founders here and then we also

42
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,640
have three guest rooms. We call them visiting hackers. So they come for three nights. They're

43
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,800
typically also founders building in the AI space or anything else.

44
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,560
We both have a background in productizing cutting edge papers and tech. So if you ask us this

45
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,520
question in a month or so, we might give you a slightly different answer. But right now a drip

46
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,160
is a pipeline that allows you to generate stylized videos just from your phone. So

47
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,840
with a few taps and prompt input, you can make yourself a pirate or recast your room

48
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,000
as an outer space, things like that. You can see the majority of the innovation happening on the

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,440
image space are actually happening all over the place. Sure, Google might publish a paper opening.

50
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,080
I might have a model, but everyone else can't do that too. There's stuff coming out of Berkeley,

51
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,160
Stanford, all the time. You know, I thought that a lot of things were going to take years.

52
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,200
Like I thought multimodal input that GPT-4 just showed off would maybe be another year out. But

53
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,720
so I, maybe, maybe I just shouldn't make these. All right. And now I think our recording. There

54
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,160
are people that worry that's going to take their jobs. I don't think it's going to take people's

55
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,120
jobs for a long, long time. I don't know how many decades, but all it's going to do right now is

56
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,000
augment our jobs. There's just going to be more and better of everything, more and better art,

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,680
more and better text, more and better analysis. And it's just going to accelerate the pace of

58
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,840
everything. It's going to be a companion to us in our scientific research in 10 or 15 or 20 years

59
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,360
that's going to allow science to move forward faster, to have scientists to do more

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,800
and expand into more areas. So I would just drop everything and focus on what you can do

61
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:07,000
newly with generative AI. We are, we've created our Hack Week and everyone in our company is

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,360
tasked with bringing AI into their job. And you should do that with your company and whatever

63
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,760
company you've got going or you're thinking of building. Have that mindset because now is a time

64
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,080
you only get this every 14 years, take advantage of it.

65
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,560
In the 1987 book from Apple, they say when you're doing an interface, you should make it

66
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,760
such that it's like people can play with it. It's a playful interface because the way users

67
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,640
learn how to use your product, it's the same way we all learn to do anything.

68
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,080
Yeah, maybe I can do it from here.

69
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:03,240
The thing that we do love is like what? We are heavy users of this amazing technology. It helps us

70
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,680
be way more productive, especially at 3 a.m.

71
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,080
I think that one of the main things that are going to change with generative AI is the way

72
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,720
how we interact with technology and the interactions are going to become way deeper

73
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,800
and they are going to resemble more how we interact with a human than how we interact with

74
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,320
an object. In our case, since we are interested in creativity and we are building a creative tool,

75
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:35,400
a good analogy to look at is in 87, Photoshop started to appear too and at that moment we

76
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,320
created like a certain interface to paint with pixels. We have like some sort of digital paper,

77
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,680
how do we paint here? What is it going to be the interface? That UX didn't change in 30 or 40

78
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,640
years. If you look at the evolution of Photoshop, it's kind of the same thing. So we kind of found

79
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:58,920
the UX for painting with a digital brush. So that is kind of our vision to find the right UX

80
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,720
for creative people to interact with AI effectively. This is the first product that we were talking about

81
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,880
before. It's a Prom Search engine. All of these images that you see here have been generated

82
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:16,280
with AI. But as we got into HFZ, we started to realize that was not the way to create a startup

83
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,760
because for a startup, you need to have a user. You need to have a customer. You need to think

84
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,600
about the problem that you're solving and someone needs to pay you. So what we found out is that

85
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,680
that this thing that we had, it was like extremely powerful but just for like a extremely small group

86
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,760
of people that were super interested in this technology. That's how the first product came.

87
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,080
The new thing is the Kria canvas, which is the product that we've been working on for the past

88
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:47,400
four months. It's a collaborative whiteboard that is focused on using artificial intelligence for

89
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,360
prototyping visual ideas. I'm working with both like Erwan and Diego.

90
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:03,320
All of these are different artificial intelligence models. Each one is focused on a specific style.

91
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,640
It makes it really easy to create mood boards. Yeah, with the images that you generate.

92
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,440
ChatGPT was not like any crazy breakthrough. It was just like a chatbot, something that everybody

93
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,000
knows how to use. You use WhatsApp, you use Telegram. Instead of talking with another human,

94
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,600
you're talking with an AI. Even my mom can access the state of the art of artificial

95
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,960
intelligence in 2023. It really shows how important it is to make these tools accessible

96
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,440
because they can do amazing things, but people need to have tools to use them.

97
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,160
I think it was like canvas, get active object, and then for each object, clone it,

98
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,040
and then I can do like objects that clone this thing, grab the clone, and then it's like,

99
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,120
okay, what do you want to do with the clone? There you go. I now spend my time thinking instead of typing.

100
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,920
Hi, nice to meet you. Come in.

101
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,840
Yeah, so right now we are launching this, the new product with Generate API to help

102
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,640
brands create marketing images with just simple descriptions and simple scene builders.

103
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,680
Me and my co-founder were both from Ukraine. The team was distributed after the COVID hit.

104
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,240
We started hiring remotely because before that we had all the team in Kiev. Everybody got

105
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:34,040
distributed. I moved here, so that is very exciting. Right now with the new Generate API,

106
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:40,520
a lot of the output and the quality of generated image actually lies on the user,

107
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:47,320
on the quality of what they write there. We were testing a lot of hypothesis on how we can explain

108
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,760
to user what to do, how we can give this perfect instruction, how we can help brands

109
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:59,400
tell their stories better with EI. EI is the new electricity because it will power everything,

110
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,840
business processes, data. It requires some effort to keep up with the space which is

111
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,640
challenging, but also focus on your users and not get distracted by the noise.

112
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,920
What eventually what matters is if you build the product that people want or not,

113
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,200
and that requires some concentration and calm mind and just focus on your customer.

114
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,800
It's a little bit of a challenge to move to a new country, but San Francisco is very welcoming to

115
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,520
people from different backgrounds, so I don't feel, I feel very included here. It takes some time

116
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,000
to build a network for sure. It was a little bit of a challenge, but right now we have like

117
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,760
10 events per week. Everybody's excited and everybody's very open.

118
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:54,120
What if you decided that you have 400,000 data analysts in a warehouse, air conditioned

119
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,960
warehouse, ready to do work for you right now? How would things change? How would that be different?

120
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,520
What would be possible? This will be the greatest technology humanity has yet developed.

121
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,400
The world is new again for the first time in 14 years and there's so much opportunities. You

122
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,040
have to be able to throw out what was old and you have to be able to think big and you have to

123
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,920
realize that there's going to be different mental patterns and feel comfortable with those different

124
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,480
mental patterns and that's where you're going to get your visionary founders. It has come out of

125
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,920
decades of research into the algorithms to manage data, but now we've just reached a point where

126
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,080
the processing storage and the processing speed and all that has allowed us to put these large

127
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,600
language models together to do things that are really amazing in the same way that the

128
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,400
smartphone was amazing in the same way that the internet itself was amazing and it's just going

129
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,240
to touch every industry.
