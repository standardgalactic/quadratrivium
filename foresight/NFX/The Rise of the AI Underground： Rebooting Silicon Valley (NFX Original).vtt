You know, Silicon Valley has these boom and bust cycles, and Silicon Valley has these

00:28.600 --> 00:35.000
boom and bust cycles. But now everyone's coming back. And it turns out that this area

00:35.000 --> 00:40.280
in Hayes Valley, which is just sort of in the center of the San Francisco area, is being

00:40.280 --> 00:45.720
a magnet for all this AI activity. It feels like people are talking again, they're meeting

00:45.720 --> 00:50.760
again, they're having parties again. It's happening in person. And that really changes

00:50.760 --> 00:55.080
things for people in terms of how fast they think, how they learn about KPIs, and that

00:55.080 --> 00:57.560
sort of old magic that we had before seems to be coming back.

00:57.560 --> 01:03.320
We have about 100 people out here today, after hours, after work hours, meeting up at Salesforce

01:03.320 --> 01:09.320
Park here, talking about the ChadGBT-4 usage that's not accessible through the ChadGBT-plus

01:09.320 --> 01:12.200
subscription and some amplification with the research.

01:12.200 --> 01:17.400
It's a San Francisco party, the attack just drops and we go for it.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.800
Right now in the last six months while we've been watching this is the founders have jumped

01:20.800 --> 01:24.840
on this new powerful engine. It's like someone gave them an internal combustion engine, and

01:24.840 --> 01:28.840
they thought, now what can I do with this? And they've thought of cars, they've thought

01:28.840 --> 01:33.240
of buses, they've thought of trucks, but everybody's thought of cars and buses. Everyone's come

01:33.240 --> 01:38.840
up with the same ideas looking at these LLMs. Every month we get these things together because

01:38.840 --> 01:44.200
we want you guys to become friends. And you're all here in the middle of it. So it's your

01:44.200 --> 01:50.120
time to focus on your business ideas and to move as fast as you can and not to let up.

01:50.120 --> 01:56.040
People ask me how big is this? And the context I like to look at it is that between 94 and

01:56.040 --> 02:00.760
2020, we went through what we're calling the connecting, where we got the world connected

02:00.760 --> 02:05.880
up on the internet, mobile phones, all these devices everywhere. And so now we've got 4 billion

02:05.880 --> 02:11.560
people connected and eventually it'll be everybody on the planet. But that main 20 year, 25 year

02:11.560 --> 02:15.800
period was when we connected the world and we were here for that. And now we're entering the

02:15.800 --> 02:20.440
phase. What we're thinking of is the transition where we're going to be adding sort of silicon

02:20.440 --> 02:25.080
based life to this planet. So we're carbon based life and this stuff is going to be thinking in,

02:25.080 --> 02:29.800
I don't know, 80 years, 100 years, but this is the beginning of that phase where we actually see

02:29.800 --> 02:34.840
software and silicon starting to do a lot of the cognitive work that humans have done in the past.

02:34.840 --> 02:38.600
And that's now beginning. We can see it. We've been talking about it for 80 years,

02:38.600 --> 02:44.360
but we can now see it. And this is when it just started. So it's a big deal. We're here for it.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.400
And now it's up to us to be the first people who start to get to build things with it.

02:49.720 --> 03:13.000
And vision a world where people could just build shit

03:13.000 --> 03:17.400
and not have to worry about anything else. And hackathons give that to you for a weekend. And

03:17.400 --> 03:22.840
it's like, it's so good, but it's just a weekend and then it's over. And so I was constantly

03:23.400 --> 03:27.000
trying to find like the next hackathon, the next hackathon, the next, and there weren't that many

03:27.000 --> 03:32.040
back then. I started going to hackathons in like 2011. The vision that whole time was like

03:32.760 --> 03:37.000
this world where you can just build and not have to worry about anything else. And that was the

03:37.000 --> 03:43.320
birth of HF0. So the idea is that we create something where people never actually have to

03:43.320 --> 03:47.800
leave or think about anything else. But when people are in this container and it's like they're

03:47.800 --> 03:53.160
surrounded by other people who are pushing the limits of how fast you can move and what's possible

03:53.960 --> 03:59.880
to build, like we just see founders move at a pace I've never seen before.

04:00.920 --> 04:07.400
Or there are three floors here across the basement. We have like 16 founders here and then we also

04:07.400 --> 04:11.640
have three guest rooms. We call them visiting hackers. So they come for three nights. They're

04:11.640 --> 04:15.800
typically also founders building in the AI space or anything else.

04:27.800 --> 04:33.560
We both have a background in productizing cutting edge papers and tech. So if you ask us this

04:33.560 --> 04:38.520
question in a month or so, we might give you a slightly different answer. But right now a drip

04:38.520 --> 04:45.160
is a pipeline that allows you to generate stylized videos just from your phone. So

04:45.960 --> 04:52.840
with a few taps and prompt input, you can make yourself a pirate or recast your room

04:52.840 --> 04:59.000
as an outer space, things like that. You can see the majority of the innovation happening on the

04:59.000 --> 05:04.440
image space are actually happening all over the place. Sure, Google might publish a paper opening.

05:04.440 --> 05:09.080
I might have a model, but everyone else can't do that too. There's stuff coming out of Berkeley,

05:09.080 --> 05:13.160
Stanford, all the time. You know, I thought that a lot of things were going to take years.

05:13.160 --> 05:18.200
Like I thought multimodal input that GPT-4 just showed off would maybe be another year out. But

05:19.160 --> 05:25.720
so I, maybe, maybe I just shouldn't make these. All right. And now I think our recording. There

05:25.720 --> 05:29.160
are people that worry that's going to take their jobs. I don't think it's going to take people's

05:29.160 --> 05:34.120
jobs for a long, long time. I don't know how many decades, but all it's going to do right now is

05:34.200 --> 05:39.000
augment our jobs. There's just going to be more and better of everything, more and better art,

05:39.000 --> 05:44.680
more and better text, more and better analysis. And it's just going to accelerate the pace of

05:44.680 --> 05:50.840
everything. It's going to be a companion to us in our scientific research in 10 or 15 or 20 years

05:50.840 --> 05:54.360
that's going to allow science to move forward faster, to have scientists to do more

05:55.000 --> 05:59.800
and expand into more areas. So I would just drop everything and focus on what you can do

05:59.800 --> 06:07.000
newly with generative AI. We are, we've created our Hack Week and everyone in our company is

06:07.000 --> 06:12.360
tasked with bringing AI into their job. And you should do that with your company and whatever

06:12.360 --> 06:16.760
company you've got going or you're thinking of building. Have that mindset because now is a time

06:16.760 --> 06:19.080
you only get this every 14 years, take advantage of it.

06:31.240 --> 06:37.560
In the 1987 book from Apple, they say when you're doing an interface, you should make it

06:38.280 --> 06:44.760
such that it's like people can play with it. It's a playful interface because the way users

06:44.840 --> 06:49.640
learn how to use your product, it's the same way we all learn to do anything.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.080
Yeah, maybe I can do it from here.

06:55.560 --> 07:03.240
The thing that we do love is like what? We are heavy users of this amazing technology. It helps us

07:04.600 --> 07:06.680
be way more productive, especially at 3 a.m.

07:09.560 --> 07:13.080
I think that one of the main things that are going to change with generative AI is the way

07:13.080 --> 07:17.720
how we interact with technology and the interactions are going to become way deeper

07:17.720 --> 07:21.800
and they are going to resemble more how we interact with a human than how we interact with

07:21.800 --> 07:27.320
an object. In our case, since we are interested in creativity and we are building a creative tool,

07:27.320 --> 07:35.400
a good analogy to look at is in 87, Photoshop started to appear too and at that moment we

07:35.400 --> 07:41.320
created like a certain interface to paint with pixels. We have like some sort of digital paper,

07:41.320 --> 07:46.680
how do we paint here? What is it going to be the interface? That UX didn't change in 30 or 40

07:46.680 --> 07:51.640
years. If you look at the evolution of Photoshop, it's kind of the same thing. So we kind of found

07:51.640 --> 07:58.920
the UX for painting with a digital brush. So that is kind of our vision to find the right UX

07:58.920 --> 08:03.720
for creative people to interact with AI effectively. This is the first product that we were talking about

08:03.720 --> 08:09.880
before. It's a Prom Search engine. All of these images that you see here have been generated

08:09.880 --> 08:16.280
with AI. But as we got into HFZ, we started to realize that was not the way to create a startup

08:16.280 --> 08:20.760
because for a startup, you need to have a user. You need to have a customer. You need to think

08:20.760 --> 08:24.600
about the problem that you're solving and someone needs to pay you. So what we found out is that

08:24.600 --> 08:28.680
that this thing that we had, it was like extremely powerful but just for like a extremely small group

08:28.680 --> 08:32.760
of people that were super interested in this technology. That's how the first product came.

08:32.760 --> 08:39.080
The new thing is the Kria canvas, which is the product that we've been working on for the past

08:39.080 --> 08:47.400
four months. It's a collaborative whiteboard that is focused on using artificial intelligence for

08:47.400 --> 08:52.360
prototyping visual ideas. I'm working with both like Erwan and Diego.

08:56.280 --> 09:03.320
All of these are different artificial intelligence models. Each one is focused on a specific style.

09:03.320 --> 09:07.640
It makes it really easy to create mood boards. Yeah, with the images that you generate.

09:07.640 --> 09:12.440
ChatGPT was not like any crazy breakthrough. It was just like a chatbot, something that everybody

09:12.440 --> 09:17.000
knows how to use. You use WhatsApp, you use Telegram. Instead of talking with another human,

09:17.000 --> 09:22.600
you're talking with an AI. Even my mom can access the state of the art of artificial

09:22.600 --> 09:27.960
intelligence in 2023. It really shows how important it is to make these tools accessible

09:27.960 --> 09:32.440
because they can do amazing things, but people need to have tools to use them.

09:33.400 --> 09:39.160
I think it was like canvas, get active object, and then for each object, clone it,

09:39.880 --> 09:46.040
and then I can do like objects that clone this thing, grab the clone, and then it's like,

09:46.040 --> 09:52.120
okay, what do you want to do with the clone? There you go. I now spend my time thinking instead of typing.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.920
Hi, nice to meet you. Come in.

10:06.440 --> 10:10.840
Yeah, so right now we are launching this, the new product with Generate API to help

10:11.480 --> 10:17.640
brands create marketing images with just simple descriptions and simple scene builders.

10:17.640 --> 10:22.680
Me and my co-founder were both from Ukraine. The team was distributed after the COVID hit.

10:22.680 --> 10:27.240
We started hiring remotely because before that we had all the team in Kiev. Everybody got

10:27.240 --> 10:34.040
distributed. I moved here, so that is very exciting. Right now with the new Generate API,

10:34.040 --> 10:40.520
a lot of the output and the quality of generated image actually lies on the user,

10:40.520 --> 10:47.320
on the quality of what they write there. We were testing a lot of hypothesis on how we can explain

10:47.320 --> 10:52.760
to user what to do, how we can give this perfect instruction, how we can help brands

10:52.760 --> 10:59.400
tell their stories better with EI. EI is the new electricity because it will power everything,

10:59.400 --> 11:04.840
business processes, data. It requires some effort to keep up with the space which is

11:04.840 --> 11:09.640
challenging, but also focus on your users and not get distracted by the noise.

11:10.360 --> 11:14.920
What eventually what matters is if you build the product that people want or not,

11:15.720 --> 11:22.200
and that requires some concentration and calm mind and just focus on your customer.

11:22.760 --> 11:27.800
It's a little bit of a challenge to move to a new country, but San Francisco is very welcoming to

11:27.800 --> 11:34.520
people from different backgrounds, so I don't feel, I feel very included here. It takes some time

11:34.520 --> 11:39.000
to build a network for sure. It was a little bit of a challenge, but right now we have like

11:39.000 --> 11:42.760
10 events per week. Everybody's excited and everybody's very open.

11:43.400 --> 11:54.120
What if you decided that you have 400,000 data analysts in a warehouse, air conditioned

11:54.120 --> 11:59.960
warehouse, ready to do work for you right now? How would things change? How would that be different?

11:59.960 --> 12:04.520
What would be possible? This will be the greatest technology humanity has yet developed.

12:04.520 --> 12:09.400
The world is new again for the first time in 14 years and there's so much opportunities. You

12:09.400 --> 12:14.040
have to be able to throw out what was old and you have to be able to think big and you have to

12:14.040 --> 12:18.920
realize that there's going to be different mental patterns and feel comfortable with those different

12:18.920 --> 12:23.480
mental patterns and that's where you're going to get your visionary founders. It has come out of

12:23.480 --> 12:28.920
decades of research into the algorithms to manage data, but now we've just reached a point where

12:29.480 --> 12:35.080
the processing storage and the processing speed and all that has allowed us to put these large

12:35.080 --> 12:40.600
language models together to do things that are really amazing in the same way that the

12:40.600 --> 12:45.400
smartphone was amazing in the same way that the internet itself was amazing and it's just going

12:45.400 --> 12:49.240
to touch every industry.
