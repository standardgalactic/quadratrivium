0	28600	You know, Silicon Valley has these boom and bust cycles, and Silicon Valley has these
28600	35000	boom and bust cycles. But now everyone's coming back. And it turns out that this area
35000	40280	in Hayes Valley, which is just sort of in the center of the San Francisco area, is being
40280	45720	a magnet for all this AI activity. It feels like people are talking again, they're meeting
45720	50760	again, they're having parties again. It's happening in person. And that really changes
50760	55080	things for people in terms of how fast they think, how they learn about KPIs, and that
55080	57560	sort of old magic that we had before seems to be coming back.
57560	63320	We have about 100 people out here today, after hours, after work hours, meeting up at Salesforce
63320	69320	Park here, talking about the ChadGBT-4 usage that's not accessible through the ChadGBT-plus
69320	72200	subscription and some amplification with the research.
72200	77400	It's a San Francisco party, the attack just drops and we go for it.
77400	80800	Right now in the last six months while we've been watching this is the founders have jumped
80800	84840	on this new powerful engine. It's like someone gave them an internal combustion engine, and
84840	88840	they thought, now what can I do with this? And they've thought of cars, they've thought
88840	93240	of buses, they've thought of trucks, but everybody's thought of cars and buses. Everyone's come
93240	98840	up with the same ideas looking at these LLMs. Every month we get these things together because
98840	104200	we want you guys to become friends. And you're all here in the middle of it. So it's your
104200	110120	time to focus on your business ideas and to move as fast as you can and not to let up.
110120	116040	People ask me how big is this? And the context I like to look at it is that between 94 and
116040	120760	2020, we went through what we're calling the connecting, where we got the world connected
120760	125880	up on the internet, mobile phones, all these devices everywhere. And so now we've got 4 billion
125880	131560	people connected and eventually it'll be everybody on the planet. But that main 20 year, 25 year
131560	135800	period was when we connected the world and we were here for that. And now we're entering the
135800	140440	phase. What we're thinking of is the transition where we're going to be adding sort of silicon
140440	145080	based life to this planet. So we're carbon based life and this stuff is going to be thinking in,
145080	149800	I don't know, 80 years, 100 years, but this is the beginning of that phase where we actually see
149800	154840	software and silicon starting to do a lot of the cognitive work that humans have done in the past.
154840	158600	And that's now beginning. We can see it. We've been talking about it for 80 years,
158600	164360	but we can now see it. And this is when it just started. So it's a big deal. We're here for it.
165000	169400	And now it's up to us to be the first people who start to get to build things with it.
169720	193000	And vision a world where people could just build shit
193000	197400	and not have to worry about anything else. And hackathons give that to you for a weekend. And
197400	202840	it's like, it's so good, but it's just a weekend and then it's over. And so I was constantly
203400	207000	trying to find like the next hackathon, the next hackathon, the next, and there weren't that many
207000	212040	back then. I started going to hackathons in like 2011. The vision that whole time was like
212760	217000	this world where you can just build and not have to worry about anything else. And that was the
217000	223320	birth of HF0. So the idea is that we create something where people never actually have to
223320	227800	leave or think about anything else. But when people are in this container and it's like they're
227800	233160	surrounded by other people who are pushing the limits of how fast you can move and what's possible
233960	239880	to build, like we just see founders move at a pace I've never seen before.
240920	247400	Or there are three floors here across the basement. We have like 16 founders here and then we also
247400	251640	have three guest rooms. We call them visiting hackers. So they come for three nights. They're
251640	255800	typically also founders building in the AI space or anything else.
267800	273560	We both have a background in productizing cutting edge papers and tech. So if you ask us this
273560	278520	question in a month or so, we might give you a slightly different answer. But right now a drip
278520	285160	is a pipeline that allows you to generate stylized videos just from your phone. So
285960	292840	with a few taps and prompt input, you can make yourself a pirate or recast your room
292840	299000	as an outer space, things like that. You can see the majority of the innovation happening on the
299000	304440	image space are actually happening all over the place. Sure, Google might publish a paper opening.
304440	309080	I might have a model, but everyone else can't do that too. There's stuff coming out of Berkeley,
309080	313160	Stanford, all the time. You know, I thought that a lot of things were going to take years.
313160	318200	Like I thought multimodal input that GPT-4 just showed off would maybe be another year out. But
319160	325720	so I, maybe, maybe I just shouldn't make these. All right. And now I think our recording. There
325720	329160	are people that worry that's going to take their jobs. I don't think it's going to take people's
329160	334120	jobs for a long, long time. I don't know how many decades, but all it's going to do right now is
334200	339000	augment our jobs. There's just going to be more and better of everything, more and better art,
339000	344680	more and better text, more and better analysis. And it's just going to accelerate the pace of
344680	350840	everything. It's going to be a companion to us in our scientific research in 10 or 15 or 20 years
350840	354360	that's going to allow science to move forward faster, to have scientists to do more
355000	359800	and expand into more areas. So I would just drop everything and focus on what you can do
359800	367000	newly with generative AI. We are, we've created our Hack Week and everyone in our company is
367000	372360	tasked with bringing AI into their job. And you should do that with your company and whatever
372360	376760	company you've got going or you're thinking of building. Have that mindset because now is a time
376760	379080	you only get this every 14 years, take advantage of it.
391240	397560	In the 1987 book from Apple, they say when you're doing an interface, you should make it
398280	404760	such that it's like people can play with it. It's a playful interface because the way users
404840	409640	learn how to use your product, it's the same way we all learn to do anything.
410680	413080	Yeah, maybe I can do it from here.
415560	423240	The thing that we do love is like what? We are heavy users of this amazing technology. It helps us
424600	426680	be way more productive, especially at 3 a.m.
429560	433080	I think that one of the main things that are going to change with generative AI is the way
433080	437720	how we interact with technology and the interactions are going to become way deeper
437720	441800	and they are going to resemble more how we interact with a human than how we interact with
441800	447320	an object. In our case, since we are interested in creativity and we are building a creative tool,
447320	455400	a good analogy to look at is in 87, Photoshop started to appear too and at that moment we
455400	461320	created like a certain interface to paint with pixels. We have like some sort of digital paper,
461320	466680	how do we paint here? What is it going to be the interface? That UX didn't change in 30 or 40
466680	471640	years. If you look at the evolution of Photoshop, it's kind of the same thing. So we kind of found
471640	478920	the UX for painting with a digital brush. So that is kind of our vision to find the right UX
478920	483720	for creative people to interact with AI effectively. This is the first product that we were talking about
483720	489880	before. It's a Prom Search engine. All of these images that you see here have been generated
489880	496280	with AI. But as we got into HFZ, we started to realize that was not the way to create a startup
496280	500760	because for a startup, you need to have a user. You need to have a customer. You need to think
500760	504600	about the problem that you're solving and someone needs to pay you. So what we found out is that
504600	508680	that this thing that we had, it was like extremely powerful but just for like a extremely small group
508680	512760	of people that were super interested in this technology. That's how the first product came.
512760	519080	The new thing is the Kria canvas, which is the product that we've been working on for the past
519080	527400	four months. It's a collaborative whiteboard that is focused on using artificial intelligence for
527400	532360	prototyping visual ideas. I'm working with both like Erwan and Diego.
536280	543320	All of these are different artificial intelligence models. Each one is focused on a specific style.
543320	547640	It makes it really easy to create mood boards. Yeah, with the images that you generate.
547640	552440	ChatGPT was not like any crazy breakthrough. It was just like a chatbot, something that everybody
552440	557000	knows how to use. You use WhatsApp, you use Telegram. Instead of talking with another human,
557000	562600	you're talking with an AI. Even my mom can access the state of the art of artificial
562600	567960	intelligence in 2023. It really shows how important it is to make these tools accessible
567960	572440	because they can do amazing things, but people need to have tools to use them.
573400	579160	I think it was like canvas, get active object, and then for each object, clone it,
579880	586040	and then I can do like objects that clone this thing, grab the clone, and then it's like,
586040	592120	okay, what do you want to do with the clone? There you go. I now spend my time thinking instead of typing.
602840	604920	Hi, nice to meet you. Come in.
606440	610840	Yeah, so right now we are launching this, the new product with Generate API to help
611480	617640	brands create marketing images with just simple descriptions and simple scene builders.
617640	622680	Me and my co-founder were both from Ukraine. The team was distributed after the COVID hit.
622680	627240	We started hiring remotely because before that we had all the team in Kiev. Everybody got
627240	634040	distributed. I moved here, so that is very exciting. Right now with the new Generate API,
634040	640520	a lot of the output and the quality of generated image actually lies on the user,
640520	647320	on the quality of what they write there. We were testing a lot of hypothesis on how we can explain
647320	652760	to user what to do, how we can give this perfect instruction, how we can help brands
652760	659400	tell their stories better with EI. EI is the new electricity because it will power everything,
659400	664840	business processes, data. It requires some effort to keep up with the space which is
664840	669640	challenging, but also focus on your users and not get distracted by the noise.
670360	674920	What eventually what matters is if you build the product that people want or not,
675720	682200	and that requires some concentration and calm mind and just focus on your customer.
682760	687800	It's a little bit of a challenge to move to a new country, but San Francisco is very welcoming to
687800	694520	people from different backgrounds, so I don't feel, I feel very included here. It takes some time
694520	699000	to build a network for sure. It was a little bit of a challenge, but right now we have like
699000	702760	10 events per week. Everybody's excited and everybody's very open.
703400	714120	What if you decided that you have 400,000 data analysts in a warehouse, air conditioned
714120	719960	warehouse, ready to do work for you right now? How would things change? How would that be different?
719960	724520	What would be possible? This will be the greatest technology humanity has yet developed.
724520	729400	The world is new again for the first time in 14 years and there's so much opportunities. You
729400	734040	have to be able to throw out what was old and you have to be able to think big and you have to
734040	738920	realize that there's going to be different mental patterns and feel comfortable with those different
738920	743480	mental patterns and that's where you're going to get your visionary founders. It has come out of
743480	748920	decades of research into the algorithms to manage data, but now we've just reached a point where
749480	755080	the processing storage and the processing speed and all that has allowed us to put these large
755080	760600	language models together to do things that are really amazing in the same way that the
760600	765400	smartphone was amazing in the same way that the internet itself was amazing and it's just going
765400	769240	to touch every industry.
