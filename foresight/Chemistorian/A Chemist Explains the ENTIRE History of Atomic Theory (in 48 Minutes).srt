1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey, Los Alamos director, ready for firing circuit.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,000
30 seconds before a shower.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
15.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,000
Cameras are ready aboard ship and in the sky.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Two, one, fire!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is the power of the atom.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Just a few years before this, in March 1940, an article was published that changed the world forever.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Here's how it started.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The attached detailed report concerns the possibility of constructing a super bomb,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which utilizes the energy stored in atomic nuclei as a source of energy.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The energy liberated in the explosion of such a super bomb is about the same as that produced by the explosion of 1,000 tons of dynamite.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This energy is liberated in a small volume in which it will, for an instant, produce a temperature comparable to that in the interior of the sun.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The blast from such an explosion would destroy life in a wide area.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The size of this area is difficult to estimate, but it will probably cover the center of a big city.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This report, written by two German-Jewish refugees in Britain by the names of Otto Robert Frisch and Rudolf Paels,

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
also detailed how such a super bomb could be made and explained how only around a pound or half a kilogram of uranium would be needed to make it.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Radioactive vapor and debris rose to five miles and lasted an hour before dispersing.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
How did we get to this point?

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How did science go from the discovery of the atom to unleashing its full power,

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
inevitably dragging us into the atomic age where we find ourselves today?

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
To answer that, we need to go back in time, way back.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
In ancient times, people reverenced the sun as the god of health, sending life to earth dwellers.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Amazingly, the idea of the atom was first put forward around two and a half thousand years ago.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In the 5th century BC, the Greek philosopher Lucipus and his more famous student, Democritus,

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
proposed that the universe consists of two fundamental constituents, the void, or nothingness,

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and tiny, solid, indestructible particles that cannot be broken down any further.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
They called these particles atomos, meaning indivisible.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Democritus wrote that atoms and void are the only things that actually exist

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and that all other things are only said to exist by social convention.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
To illustrate this, imagine you're looking at a mountain made of trillions of specks of dust.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now, is that actually a mountain that you see, or is that just what we as a society would call it?

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is it in fact just dust in a specific shape that we're giving the name mountain?

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Can we even say with certainty that the mountain truly exists, or is it just the dust that exists?

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The theory went that atoms were too small for humans to see, but they had different sizes and different shapes.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
They were infinite in number and had always existed.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They could also combine together due to hooks or eyes on their surfaces, for example.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The combination of different types of atoms gives rise to the different forms of matter we see all around us.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The theory was most poetically summarized a few centuries later by the Roman philosopher Lucretius,

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
who wrote Dererum Natura, or On the Nature of Things.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He described how harder solids were composed of more hooked atoms to allow them to connect together more strongly,

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and liquids were composed of smoother atoms which could move over each other.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He also described how pleasant flavors were caused by rounder atoms passing over the tongue,

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and how bitterness was caused by more crooked atoms.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Combining these phenomena, he said that seawater was composed of smooth atoms to give it its fluidity,

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and some rough ones mixed in to give it its bitter taste.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now, there was no empirical evidence for any of this, just philosophical thought.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
However, tiny particles of different sizes that make up matter,

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
bonds forming between those particles which can have different strengths,

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
different combinations of atoms forming different substances,

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
it's amazing how much they got right just by logical reasoning alone.

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The philosophy became known as atomism,

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and millennia later it was still supported by the founder of modern chemistry, Robert Boyle,

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and by the founder of classical physics, Sir Isaac Newton.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But not everybody accepted the idea since there wasn't any actual evidence for any of it.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A particle so infinitely small that it takes over a hundred billion billion atoms to make up the head of a pin.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Today, the concept of the atom underpins all of modern chemistry.

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's amazing to think there was a time when chemistry was being done when we didn't know anything about the atom at all.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But by the end of the 18th century, two major laws in chemistry had already been established.

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The first law was the law of conservation of mass, which was popularized by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier.

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This law states that during a chemical reaction, the total mass of the products is equal to the total mass of the reactants.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The second law was the law of definite proportions, which was established by another French chemist, Joseph Proust.

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This law states that a given compound always contains its constituent elements in a fixed ratio.

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
For example, water is always 8 ninths oxygen by mass and 1 ninth hydrogen by mass, regardless of the source of the water or how it was prepared.

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Now, neither of these laws specifically required the existence of the atom.

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
However, in 1794, an English chemist called John Dalton joined the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester,

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and he would go on to change the world of chemistry forever.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Dalton's very first paper for the society was called Extraordinary Facts relating to the vision of colors with observations.

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
In it, he described his own color blindness.

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
For instance, he said,

70
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now, this phenomenon had never been studied before, and Dalton single-handedly introduced the world to its existence.

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
In fact, many languages now call color blindness Daltonism.

72
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In 1995, tissue from Dalton's preserved eyeball was analyzed to show that he would have been red-green colorblind.

73
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But Dalton contributed a lot more than just an awareness of color blindness.

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He was also a meteorologist and would climb England's highest peaks on multiple occasions to get measurements,

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
climbing Helvellen alone over 40 times.

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Reading through Dalton's works, it seems like he was also fascinated by chemical ratios.

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He would go on to establish a third fundamental law of chemistry, the law of multiple proportions.

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This law states that if two elements can combine to form different compounds when the mass of the first element is held constant,

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the ratios between the masses of the second element in the different compounds will always be ratios of small, whole numbers.

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay, hold on. This will make more sense with an example.

81
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
In Dalton's 1808 publication, A New System of Chemical Philosophy, he describes the preparation and composition of hundreds of compounds.

82
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In section 13, Metallic Oxides, he covers the two known oxides of copper, which he calls copper protoxide and copper deutoxide.

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Today we know these as copper one oxide, where the copper ions all have a single positive charge,

84
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and copper two oxide, where the copper ions have a two plus charge.

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Dalton said that copper protoxide contains 12 and a half parts of oxygen to 100 parts of copper,

86
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and that copper deutoxide contains 25 parts of oxygen to 100 parts of copper.

87
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So, with a constant mass of copper, the ratio of oxygen in the two compounds is one to two, a simple whole number ratio.

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is what Dalton described in his Law of Multiple Proportions.

89
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Now, this law does suggest the existence of atoms, because since elements combine in very specific ratios,

90
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
it implies that they consist of discrete individual particles that are combining in very specific ratios.

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
His interest in chemical ratios led him to develop atomic theory more than anyone before him.

92
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's rewind a bit.

93
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
In 1803, Dalton published a paper called On the Absorption of Gases by Water and Other Liquids.

94
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
At the end of his paper, he casually included his first-ever table of relative atomic weights,

95
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and it's actually really inaccurate.

96
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
However, this was an amazing first step.

97
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The problem was, Dalton was using some faulty reasoning to work out these numbers.

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's go back to Dalton's 1808 publication, A New System of Chemical Philosophy, where he explains this more.

99
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Here, he goes into more detail about his atomic theory, and he established some rules about how he believed elements combined to form compounds.

100
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There are many possible ways that they can combine, which Dalton labeled as binary, tarnary, quaternary, etc.

101
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He thought that if only one compound could be formed between two elements, the molecule would always be binary.

102
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hence, he went on to deduce that water is a binary compound of hydrogen and oxygen,

103
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and that ammonia is a binary compound of hydrogen and azote, which is the old name for nitrogen.

104
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Unfortunately, this was all wrong.

105
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He also had no way of recognizing that some elements could exist as diatomic molecules.

106
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
All of this meant that he simply wouldn't have been able to accurately calculate how heavy atoms were compared to each other.

107
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He included a new list of relative weights here, which was updated from the previous table in his 1803 publication,

108
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
but it's still incorrect due to his faulty assumptions.

109
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He also described how atoms were indestructible, saying,

110
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We might as well attempt to introduce a new planet into the solar system or to annihilate one already in existence

111
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
as to create or destroy a particle of hydrogen.

112
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
However, a lot of the logic employed by Dalton's work was mostly very good.

113
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Based on his experimentations and observations, he concluded that there must be individual particles that make up matter

114
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and that atoms of a given element are identical to each other.

115
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He described atoms combining in different ratios when reacting.

116
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He talked about how atoms must be finite in number, contradicting the ancient philosophical theory

117
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
where they thought that atoms were infinite in number.

118
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Dalton really got the ball rolling for our modern understanding of the atom.

119
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Over the next few decades, other chemists did experiments to investigate the ratios between reacting elements

120
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and more accurate relative masses were gradually discovered.

121
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
In 1815 and 1816, the English chemist William Prout published work where he observed that

122
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
of the relative atomic weights that had been determined so far,

123
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
they all seemed to be a whole number multiple of hydrogen.

124
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He suggests that all other elements were essentially just clusters of hydrogen atoms.

125
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He named this fundamental particle, Protile, from proto-heil or primary matter,

126
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and said that hydrogen consisted of one Protile, helium of two, lithium of three, and so on.

127
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This was the first suggestion of a particle that made up the atom.

128
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
However, the concept of the Protile was later disproved by the Swedish chemist, Johns Jacob Basilius,

129
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
who noticed that chlorine had a relative mass of 35.5.

130
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It wasn't until the 1900s that the concept of isotopes was established to explain this phenomenon.

131
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
More on that later.

132
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
By the mid-1800s, many relative atomic masses had been accurately determined.

133
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
However, at this point, chemists still thought the atom was nothing more than a solid, indestructible sphere.

134
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It is impossible to show the correct relative proportions of an atom on this screen.

135
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
For example, if an atom could be as large as the United States,

136
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
one of its electrons would be only about 100 feet across.

137
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Therefore, to tell our story, we must resort to a symbol.

138
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The English chemist Michael Faraday was famous for his work on electromagnetism and electrochemistry,

139
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
not to mention his fascinating discovery of benzene.

140
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Make sure to check out my video on that for the full story.

141
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Since he could cause reactions to happen using electric fields, as in electrolysis,

142
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and induce electric currents from chemical reactions, as in voltaic cells,

143
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
this implied that electric charges were a significant part of the makeup of an atom.

144
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
His work suggested that atoms were more than just solid spheres of matter.

145
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It wasn't until almost a century after Dalton's publications

146
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
that the first subatomic particle was finally discovered, the electron.

147
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
In 1897, an English physicist called Joseph John Thompson

148
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
published work where he investigated cathode rays, which were of interest to scientists at the time.

149
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
These were beautiful green fluorescent beams that were made by creating a potential difference

150
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
between two electrodes that had been sealed in a vacuum tube.

151
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
There was a debate in the scientific community as to what these rays actually were.

152
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Some thought that they were waves as they traveled in straight lines and were unaffected by gravity.

153
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Others thought they were charged particles as they could be deflected by a magnetic field.

154
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
In Thompson's publication, he described what happened as follows.

155
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
At high exhaustions, meaning very low pressure,

156
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
the rays were deflected when the two aluminium plates were connected with the terminals of a battery of small storage cells.

157
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The rays were depressed when the upper plate was connected to the negative pole of the battery,

158
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the lower with the positive, and raised when the upper plate was connected with the positive,

159
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
the lower with the negative pole.

160
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Thompson demonstrated for the first time that cathode rays could be deflected by an electric field.

161
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And not only that, with similar experiments,

162
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
he was able to show that these deflected rays could charge up the electrodes that they landed on.

163
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Thus, he was able to confirm that they consisted of electrically charged particles.

164
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And because the cathode rays were attracted to the positive electrode,

165
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
he was able to confirm that the particles must be negatively charged.

166
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He also demonstrated that the deflection of cathode rays was exactly the same,

167
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
even if there were different gases present in the tube,

168
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
or if different materials were used for the electrodes.

169
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This suggested that the negatively charged particles were identical in all these different substances.

170
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The most interesting part of all of this, though, was Thompson's estimates for the size of these particles.

171
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
By measuring the radius of the curved path of the cathode rays

172
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and the depth of heat they transferred to the electrodes,

173
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
he was able to use some very elegant calculations

174
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
to show that the particles were around a thousand times lighter than the hydrogen atom,

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
which, up until that time, was thought to be the smallest unit of matter.

176
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Thompson called these tiny negatively charged particles corpuscles,

177
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
but they soon became known as electrons within the scientific community.

178
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
In 1904, Thompson published more work where he determined what the atom must look like

179
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
that includes these tiny negatively charged particles.

180
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He described a model whereby negative electrons are embedded within a larger matrix

181
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
which must be positively charged since atoms are neutral overall.

182
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This model became known as the plum pudding model,

183
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
with the plums representing the electrons and the rest of the pudding representing the positively charged matrix.

184
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This plum pudding model is quite famous nowadays and is often taught in school.

185
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
However, not many people realise that in this same paper,

186
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Thompson also put forward the notion that the electrons could be moving in orbits within the positive matrix.

187
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He used a lot of maths to determine this, accounting for all the electrostatic attractions and repulsions involved,

188
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and he described his idea as follows.

189
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
We have thus in the first place a sphere of uniform positive electrification,

190
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and inside this sphere a number of corpuscles arranged in a series of parallel rings.

191
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The number of the corpuscles in a ring varying from ring to ring.

192
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Each corpuscle is travelling at a high speed around the circumference of the ring in which it is situated,

193
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and the rings are so arranged that those which contain a large number of corpuscles are near the surface of the sphere,

194
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
while those in which there are a smaller number of corpuscles are more in the inside.

195
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Later, he even describes how rather than two-dimensional rings,

196
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
the electrons could move in three-dimensional shells,

197
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
saying, when the corpuscles are not constrained to one plane but can move about in all directions,

198
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
they will arrange themselves in a series of concentric shells.

199
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
For some reason, the idea of electron shells isn't commonly attributed to Thompson,

200
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
probably because when you hear plum pudding model, you don't tend to think about the plums whizzing around inside the pudding,

201
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
but it's right there in his 1904 paper.

202
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Two years later, in 1906, Thompson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work.

203
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Thompson was the first person to provide evidence that the atom was more complicated than Dalton originally thought.

204
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
At almost inconceivable speeds.

205
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Just a few months after Thompson proposed his plum pudding model,

206
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
a Japanese physicist called Hantaro Nagaoka published a different proposition for the structure of the atom,

207
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
which had most of the mass of the atom located in a very small, positively charged point,

208
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
which was orbited by rings of negatively charged electrons.

209
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This became known as the Saturnian model, as it somewhat resembled the rings of Saturn.

210
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
However, unlike Saturn, Nagaoka's model had a much smaller central point,

211
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and he described the rings of electrons by saying that they may or may not lie in the same plane.

212
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Sadly, Nagaoka's work has largely been forgotten by history,

213
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
but this was a remarkable improvement upon Thompson's model,

214
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
even though there were problems associated with the idea of having mutually repelling particles organized into two-dimensional rings,

215
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
which even Nagaoka himself acknowledged.

216
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Now, like Nagaoka, Thompson was a great scientist, but he was also a great teacher.

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
One of his students, Ernest Rutherford, a New Zealander, was also awarded a Nobel Prize in 1908

218
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
for his investigations into radioactive substances like uranium,

219
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
where he found that they emit different types of radiation, which he named alpha, beta, and gamma.

220
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He eventually determined that the alpha particles were just positively charged helium ions,

221
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
but it was difficult to explain where they had come from.

222
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It was also soon found that the beta particles were electrons that had been emitted from the atoms.

223
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Over the next couple of years, Rutherford and his colleagues, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marston,

224
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
did experiments into the structure of the atom.

225
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
In 1911, Rutherford published work where he outlined his findings.

226
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Here's how his most famous experiment was set up.

227
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
A very thin sheet of gold foil was placed in the center of a circular screen.

228
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
A source of alpha particles was aimed at the gold foil.

229
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The circular screen was fluorescent, so if an alpha particle hits it, it would light up where it was hit.

230
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Now, by this point, it was known that alpha particles had a relatively strong positive charge,

231
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
so it was expected that they would just blast through the gold foil, pretty much undisturbed,

232
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
because the spread out positive charge of the plum pudding model wasn't concentrated enough to stop the alpha particles.

233
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But what they actually observed was quite different.

234
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Several of the alpha particles were deflected by a few degrees.

235
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
A smaller percentage were deflected by a larger angle,

236
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and a very small percentage were deflected at much larger angles.

237
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
When describing this discovery in a later lecture,

238
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Rutherford said,

239
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life.

240
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back to hit you.

241
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Rutherford was saying that,

242
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
since most of the alpha particles weren't deflected, but a small percentage were deflected significantly,

243
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
this indicated that most of the atom is empty space,

244
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and the majority of the mass of the atom must be concentrated in a very small region in the center.

245
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That way, most of the alpha particles would fly straight through the empty space,

246
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
but the few that got close to this massive central region would be deflected.

247
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So Rutherford was able to confirm the existence of a tiny,

248
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
positively charged particle of mass in the center of the atom, just like Nagaoka had predicted.

249
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
With the discovery of the nucleus, the field of nuclear physics was born.

250
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Now observing the professor himself, we can see that his structure resembles,

251
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
in many ways, something almost as vast as the atom is small, the solar system,

252
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
and there are certain similarities.

253
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This is the center with electrons in surrounding orbits.

254
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Despite this amazing progress, there were still a couple of problems with Rutherford's nuclear model.

255
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Firstly, based on the classical electromagnetism of the time,

256
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
it was known that accelerating charges emit electromagnetic waves.

257
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This meant that the electrons should lose energy as they orbit,

258
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
eventually falling into the nucleus.

259
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Secondly, the nuclear model had no way of explaining the interesting absorption spectra of different elements.

260
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This is when you shine light through a substance, then pass the light through a prism to disperse it into a spectrum.

261
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
When we do this, we see these black lines on the spectrum where specific colors of light have been absorbed by the sample.

262
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Different substances give us different spectra, so the light is clearly interacting with the atoms in a very specific way,

263
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
but nobody could explain why or how.

264
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That was until a student of both Thompson and Rutherford came along to enlighten the world.

265
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
A Danish physicist called Niels Bohr published a brand new model for the atom in 1913.

266
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Now, to give some background on Bohr's paper,

267
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
over the last few years, scientists like Max Planck and Albert Einstein

268
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
had established that light energy could only be absorbed or emitted in discrete quanta,

269
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
which could be described as particles of light that have very specific energies.

270
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
These light particles became known as photons,

271
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and this quantum theory explained previously confusing phenomena,

272
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
like black body radiation or why hot objects glow the way they do.

273
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And the photoelectric effect, or why light can liberate electrons from metallic surfaces in the way that it does.

274
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Bohr realized that he could apply quantum theory to the electron orbits in the atom.

275
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Now, quantum theory involves a huge amount of complicated maths, so I won't go through the calculations in this video,

276
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
but Bohr was able to calculate that electron orbits were quantized.

277
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
In other words, the electron orbits could only exist at discrete energy levels,

278
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
which manifested as orbits at specific distances from the nucleus, now known as shells.

279
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
In Bohr's model, electrons cannot exist in between these shells.

280
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Quantization means that electrons can only exist in one of these strictly defined shells.

281
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
This explains why electrons don't spiral into the nucleus, because they physically can't.

282
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
They can only exist in these shells.

283
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
If an electron absorbs a photon of the exact energy of the difference between two energy levels,

284
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
it will instantaneously jump up to the next one without spending any time in between.

285
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
When it instantaneously jumps back down, it'll emit the photon again.

286
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
For bigger jumps, higher energy photons are required.

287
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This explains the black lines that can be seen on the absorbent spectra for different elements.

288
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:37,000
They're the exact frequencies of light that correspond to the very specific electron transitions for that element.

289
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Bohr's atom is a great model, and it's not too far away from our modern understanding of the atom.

290
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
In fact, it's still taught in schools today, since it's a beautiful simplification of the behaviour of the electrons.

291
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
There were still problems with Bohr's model that were apparent at the time.

292
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It was able to explain the hydrogen spectra, but it failed to accurately predict the spectra observed by elements that contained multiple electrons.

293
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Something else was going on.

294
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We know now that the electrons in a real atom are a bit stranger.

295
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
There are different members, each one having the same number of protons, but differing in the number of neutrons.

296
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The total of an atom's protons and neutrons is its atomic weight.

297
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Thus, in natural uranium we have U234, U235, and U238.

298
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
These different members of the same element or atom family, science calls isotopes.

299
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Returning to the nucleus, at this point there was still not much known about it, other than the fact that it was very small compared to the size of the atom and that it was positively charged.

300
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
In the same year that Bohr published his atomic model, an English chemist called Frederick Soddy and a Polish chemist called Kazimierz Fajans,

301
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,000
both of whom were colleagues of Rutherford, independently discovered precisely how elements change after different types of nuclear decay.

302
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:29,000
For instance, after emitting an alpha particle, an element is created with an atomic number that has reduced by 2 and a mass number that has reduced by 4 compared to the original element.

303
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:37,000
After emitting a beta particle, an element is created with an atomic number that has increased by 1 while the mass number has remained unchanged.

304
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Soddy then went on to demonstrate how, with one alpha decay and two beta decays, you would end up with an element that has the same atomic number as the original element, but with a different mass number.

305
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
These two forms of the same element would have identical chemical properties and would be very difficult to separate.

306
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
When he told a family friend, Margaret Todd, about his research, she suggested the name isotope, which was Greek for at the same place.

307
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
In reference to how these different forms of the same element would appear in the same place as each other on the periodic table.

308
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Soddy liked the name and it stuck. He would later go on to win the Nobel Prize for his discovery of isotopes.

309
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Still in the same year, Thompson published a description of an interesting experiment whereby he passed a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields

310
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and observed how they were deflected by placing photography paper in their path.

311
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Thompson was able to use these deflections to calculate the mass to charge ratios of the deflected particles.

312
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
He explained this as follows.

313
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
There can therefore, I think, be little doubts that what has been called neon is not a simple gas, but a mixture of two gases.

314
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
One of which has an atomic weight about 20 and the other about 22.

315
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:02,000
The parabola due to the heavier gas is always much fainter than that due to the lighter, so that probably the heavier gas forms only a small percentage of the mixture.

316
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:11,000
A few years after Thompson's discoveries, another English chemist called Francis William Aston would develop Thompson's mass spectrograph experiment further

317
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
into a technique that became known as mass spectrometry.

318
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Check out my video on mass spectrometry if you want to learn how all this would be done today.

319
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Aston used this technique to show that many other elements can also have different isotopes and eventually won the Nobel Prize for his work.

320
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:35,000
He published mass spectrographs of different elements, including ones where you can also see the two isotopes of neon just like Thompson had shown in his paper.

321
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So, since it was discovered that atoms of the same element can have different masses, this indicated that there was something more complicated going on in the nucleus.

322
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The electrons which are negative are attracted by the protons which are positive and vice versa.

323
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Still in 1913, the year of Bohr's publication, a brilliant English physicist called Henry Mosley, who was another student of Rutherford,

324
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
published work where he described firing x-rays at different elements and observing the spectra that they produced, and he found something interesting.

325
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:29,000
He noticed that the frequency of the x-rays produced followed a very predictable pattern whereby the square root of the x-ray frequency is proportional to the number of electrons in the atom.

326
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
A year later in 1914, Mosley published another paper.

327
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Mosley said in this paper that there is every reason to suppose that the integer which controls the x-ray spectrum is the same as the number of electrical units in the nucleus.

328
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
In other words, he said that the atomic number is the number of positive charges in the nucleus.

329
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:01,000
This was the first ever hint at the existence of the proton and it was amazing work, but sadly this would turn out to be the final publication Mosley ever produced.

330
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Shortly afterwards, the First World War broke out and Mosley enlisted with the Royal Engineers, where he served as a technical officer.

331
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
A year later, he was killed at the age of 27 by a sniper at the Battle of Gallipoli.

332
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Mosley was a brilliant scientist who Rutherford believed would have gone on to win a Nobel Prize.

333
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Isaac Asimov, one of the most famous sci-fi authors of the 20th century, said of Mosley that his death might well have been the most costly single death of the war to mankind generally.

334
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Niels Bohr said in an interview years later,

335
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
The Rutherford work was not taken seriously. We cannot understand it today, but it was not taken seriously at all.

336
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
There was no mention of it in any place. The great change came from Mosley.

337
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It really seems like Mosley would have gone on to be hugely influential in the world of science, but he was unfortunately lost too soon.

338
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Rutherford continued along the path that Mosley had started, and several years later he published multiple papers where he described how firing alpha particles through nitrogen resulted in the formation of hydrogen nuclei.

339
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Rutherford was able to explain that these hydrogen nuclei must have been knocked out of the nitrogen nuclei by the alpha particles,

340
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and so he was able to determine that they were a fundamental building block of the atomic nucleus.

341
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Remember about a hundred years before all this when William Prout suggested that all the elements heavier than hydrogen were just clusters of hydrogen atoms,

342
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and he gave these fundamental particles the name Protile?

343
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Well, Rutherford was inspired by Prout to give a name to the positively charged hydrogen nucleus that he had found inside the nuclei of other elements.

344
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Instead of Protile, he gave this particle the name Proton, and the name stuck.

345
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And with that, the first ever nuclear particle had been identified.

346
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:11,000
The electrons always try to get from a negatively charged body to one that is positively charged in relation to it.

347
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:23,000
In 1924, the French physicist Louis de Broglie built on Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect where it was discovered that light can behave as both a wave and a particle.

348
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
De Broglie posited that not only can light behave as a particle, but matter can also behave as a wave,

349
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and he formed an equation that connected a wave property, wavelength, to a matter property, momentum.

350
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
His equation suggests that all matter has a wavelength.

351
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
This means that even you and I have wavelengths of our own.

352
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The thing is though, according to this equation, the bigger the mass, the smaller the wavelength.

353
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So the wavelength of a person is completely negligible.

354
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
However, an electron is so tiny that its wavelength becomes significant.

355
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So not only can it behave as a particle, it can behave as a wave.

356
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,000
This was proved experimentally a few years later by two separate groups who independently performed very similar experiments.

357
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
One group was led by the English physicist George Padgett Thompson, the son of Joseph John Thompson who discovered the electron.

358
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The other group was led by the American physicist Clinton Davison.

359
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Each team fired electrons at different materials and managed to observe a diffraction pattern, something very specific to waves that ordinary particles cannot do.

360
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And so they observed for the first time electrons actually behaving as waves.

361
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Soon after Dubois published his theory of the wave particle duality of electrons,

362
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Austrian physicist Owen Schrodinger investigated whether the movement of an orbiting electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than a particle.

363
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And he got to work determining an equation to describe this wave system.

364
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:03,000
In 1926, he published his findings across multiple papers where he defined an equation that describes these wave-like electrons in the atom.

365
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Let's look at how this works.

366
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Imagine a guitar string that's connected at two ends.

367
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
If we pluck the string, we get a standing wave which, rather than progressing along the string, vibrates in place.

368
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Schrodinger said that electrons orbit the atom as circular standing waves.

369
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
This means that we can only get an integer number of wavelengths that can exist around that circle.

370
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Since a wave's energy is related to its wavelength, this explains why only specific energy levels are allowed according to Bohr's model.

371
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
However, the problem with Bohr's model was that he viewed the electrons solely as particles.

372
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
This new wave theory helped to explain the quantization of the energy levels.

373
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Now, the equation that Schrodinger established contained something called imaginary numbers,

374
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
meaning it couldn't correspond to something that was measurable in the real world.

375
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
However, this problem was solved by German physicist Max Born, who was another student of Thomson.

376
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Born believed that the square of Schrodinger's wave function was related to the probability of finding an electron at a specific distance from the nucleus.

377
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
This allowed scientists to use these wave functions to model complicated three-dimensional orbitals,

378
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
which are overlapping regions of space around the nucleus where you're likely to find different electrons.

379
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And this new orbital theory was much better at predicting the observed spectra of different atoms.

380
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Another German physicist, Werner Heisenberg, who was a student of both Bohr and Born,

381
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
quickly identified a strange consequence of these probability distributions.

382
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Essentially, he realized that since electrons are not simple particles in space but behave more like waves,

383
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
it's impossible to measure both an electron's position and its velocity with a high degree of certainty.

384
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
This is because a wave cannot have a specific position in space like a particle can.

385
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,000
The more precisely you know the position of an electron, the less precisely you can know its velocity and vice versa.

386
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
This became known as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

387
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:14,000
De Bruy, Schrodinger, Born, Heisenberg, Davidson and Thomson would all go on to win Nobel Prizes for their work.

388
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Interestingly, this meant that Joseph John Thomson won the Nobel Prize for proving the electron was a particle,

389
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and his son, George Paget Thomson, won the Nobel Prize for proving that it was also a wave.

390
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And so the more scientists learned about the quantum nature of the electron, the more bizarre our very reality became.

391
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
The true nature of matter is one of probabilities and uncertainties.

392
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
If you're finding this confusing, that's fine, so does everybody else.

393
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Physics of the quantum world is a lot less concrete than the world we can see around us.

394
00:36:47,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But here in the nucleus are other particles with no electrical charge called neutrons.

395
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Very important characters too, as we shall see.

396
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Thanks to Mosley and Rutherford, it was now known how many protons were in each atom.

397
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And since a proton is just a hydrogen nucleus, in theory we could just multiply the mass of the hydrogen nucleus up to get the mass of every other element's nucleus.

398
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But that didn't work. Most atoms were found to be around twice as heavy as the mass of their protons.

399
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
This implied there must be another type of particle in the nucleus.

400
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Rutherford had previously attempted to explain this in 1920 by describing clusters of protons with electrons bound to them in order to balance the charge.

401
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
He suggested that atomic nuclei were built from these clusters.

402
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:59,000
He also described an atom of mass one which has zero nucleus charge, which was formed from the coupling of one hydrogen nucleus, a proton, with an electron.

403
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
This idea of nuclear electrons was fiercely debated throughout the 1920s.

404
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:14,000
One big issue with this idea was that if we know an electron is confined to a region the size of an atomic nucleus, this gives us a high certainty of its position.

405
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So according to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the certainty of its velocity will be very low.

406
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:29,000
This means when electrons are emitted from the nucleus, as they are with beta radiation, they should have a broad range of kinetic energies,

407
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
including energies that are much larger than what's actually observed when beta particles are emitted from the nucleus.

408
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,000
In 1930, Volta Botter and Herbert Becker bombarded samples of beryllium, boron and lithium with alpha particles,

409
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and they noticed that this caused the samples to emit an unusual form of radiation.

410
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It was unaffected by electric fields, meaning it must be uncharged.

411
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:01,000
This initially led scientists to think that it was gamma rays, but they quickly noticed that this new type of radiation was much more penetrating than gamma rays were.

412
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Two years later, in 1932, Irene and Frederic Joliot-Curie noticed that when this new type of radiation was directed at paraffin wax,

413
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
it caused the wax to shoot out very high energy protons.

414
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It was soon realized that since gamma rays are waves, not particles, they would need to have a ridiculous amount of energy if they were to knock a proton out of an atom in this way.

415
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
This indicated that some kind of heavy particle was colliding with the proton instead.

416
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The Joliot-Curie's would go on to win a Nobel Prize for their work on induced radioactivity.

417
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Fun fact, these two were the second married couple ever to be jointly awarded a Nobel Prize.

418
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The first married couple was Irene's parents, Pierre-Curie and Marie-Squadowska-Curie,

419
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
who won their joint Nobel Prize for their own work on radioactivity.

420
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Here's another fun fact, Marie-Squadowska-Curie was the first ever woman to win a Nobel Prize,

421
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,000
as well as being the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields.

422
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So this was a pretty impressive family.

423
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
News of the Joliot-Curie experiments quickly reached yet another of Rutherford's students,

424
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
an English physicist called James Chadwick, and he got straight to work recreating it in his own lab.

425
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Not only was he successful, he was able to measure the speed of the emitted particles,

426
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
as well as the inexplicably large amount of recoil they caused when they collided with other atoms.

427
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
In his preliminary paper, Possible Existence of a Neutron,

428
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
he said that his results were difficult to explain if this was gamma radiation being emitted,

429
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:49,000
but the difficulties disappear, however, if it is to be assumed that the radiation consists of particles of mass 1 and charge 0, or neutrons.

430
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
This explained the high recoil of the atoms they collided with,

431
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
since an uncharged neutron would not be repelled by the nucleus it's approaching,

432
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and therefore it can collide with a much greater impact than a proton would be able to.

433
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
A few months later, he followed this up with another publication, The Existence of a Neutron, where he confirmed his findings.

434
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
With some careful experimentation and thorough calculations,

435
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
he was able to determine that the neutron had a relative mass that was slightly higher than that of the proton.

436
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
He said,

437
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Allowing for the errors in the mass measurements, it appears that the mass of the neutron cannot be less than 1.003,

438
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and that it probably lies between 1.005 and 1.008.

439
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Such a value for the mass of the neutron is to be expected if the neutron consists of a proton and an electron,

440
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and it lends strong support to this view.

441
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
This work disproved the existence of nuclear electrons,

442
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and therefore scientists came to realize that beta particles must form in the instant that they're emitted.

443
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
What they deduced is that they form when a neutron splits to give a proton and an electron.

444
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
The proton stays in the nucleus, which is why the atomic number goes up by one,

445
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
but the electron is instantly emitted.

446
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Three years after these publications, Chadwick won the Nobel Prize for his work.

447
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
With the discovery of the neutron, the full structure of the atom had been discovered,

448
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and the world would never be the same again.

449
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Since neutrons were much better at firing at atomic nuclei than protons,

450
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
a huge amount of research went into observing these collisions.

451
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
In 1938, two German chemists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann,

452
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
were performing an experiment where they bombarded uranium with neutrons,

453
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and they observed something strange.

454
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
After the bombardment, they found that some of their sample had turned into barium.

455
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Now, the barium nucleus is significantly smaller than the uranium nucleus,

456
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
so it seemed preposterous that it could have formed from normal alpha decay.

457
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Just a couple of months later, Austrian physicist Lisa Meitner and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch

458
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
published a theoretical proof that Hahn and Strassmann had successfully split the uranium nucleus.

459
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Nuclear fission had been achieved.

460
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The process released a huge amount of energy, and it was quickly realized that it could be used for power plants,

461
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
or it could be used for weapons.

462
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Let's slow down that fission a million or so times.

463
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
A single particle starts the reaction, splitting the uranium atom.

464
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Here now is the release of energy as heat and blast.

465
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Here are powerful rays being given off, similar to X-rays.

466
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
But here, here are free neutrons driven out with tremendous speed,

467
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and provided there is sufficient U-235 present, what science calls a critical mass,

468
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:22,000
those neutrons bombard other uranium atoms, causing them to split and split still others.

469
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
The result? A chain reaction.

470
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Over a million billion billion atoms exploding within two seconds.

471
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Shortly after the discovery of nuclear fission, Hitler invaded Poland and the Second World War began.

472
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Many of the German scientists who were leaders in the field of nuclear physics also happened to be Jewish,

473
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
so they had been forced to flee their home country throughout the 1930s and many of them ended up in Britain.

474
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
One of these refugees was Otto Robert Frisch.

475
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
He ended up at the University of Birmingham and was later joined by another physicist by the name of Rudolf Piles.

476
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
In March 1940, the two published the Frisch Piles Memorandum,

477
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
where they described for the first time the feasibility of creating an atomic bomb.

478
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
In their report they said,

479
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
We have no information that the same idea has also occurred to other scientists,

480
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
but since all the theoretical data bearing on this problem are published,

481
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
it is quite conceivable that Germany is in fact developing this weapon.

482
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
If one works on the assumption that Germany is or will be in the possession of this weapon,

483
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
it must be realized that no shelters are available that would be effective and that could be used on a large scale.

484
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
The most effective reply would be a counter threat with a similar bomb.

485
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And so two and a half thousand years of philosophical thought and scientific breakthroughs had inevitably led here

486
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
to an atomic arms race unlike anything the world had ever seen.

487
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
In Britain, an atomic weapons development project codenamed Tube Alloys was established.

488
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
With George Padgett-Thompson and James Chadwick as two of its founding members.

489
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Shortly afterwards, the United States began their own program led by J. Robert Oppenheimer,

490
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
which became known as the Manhattan Project.

491
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Progress in the United States eventually overtook Britain's and in 1943 the two nations signed the Quebec Agreement,

492
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
which allowed the Manhattan Project to subsume the Tube Alloys so the two could share their research.

493
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Finally, at 5.29 a.m. on the 16th of July 1945, the world's first ever atomic bomb was detonated in a test in New Mexico.

494
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,000
The site of the test was the Jornada del Muerto Desert, a name given to it by Spanish conquistadors, meaning dead man's journey.

495
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
A perfect name considering the journey the atom has been on all these centuries,

496
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
culminating in a potentially world-ending superweapon.

497
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Less than a month after the test, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

498
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Ever since, humans have lived in a society under the continual threat of a possible nuclear attack.

499
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Perhaps this was simply an inevitability of scientific progress.

500
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Despite the bleakness of all this, what I find fascinating and even inspiring about this story is how it perfectly encapsulates how science works.

501
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Each model of the atom was the best answer to the evidence that was available at the time.

502
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
When new evidence was discovered, the model had to change to keep up.

503
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Science works because of its malleability.

504
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Yes, it brought us along an inevitable path into the atomic age, but maybe, just maybe, it'll be able to bring us back out again.

505
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Go in the comments if you have any questions, and I'll see you in the next one.
