0	3000	Hey, Los Alamos director, ready for firing circuit.
5500	8000	30 seconds before a shower.
15500	16500	15.
16500	19000	Cameras are ready aboard ship and in the sky.
19000	22000	Two, one, fire!
22000	32000	This is the power of the atom.
32000	38000	Just a few years before this, in March 1940, an article was published that changed the world forever.
38000	40000	Here's how it started.
40000	44000	The attached detailed report concerns the possibility of constructing a super bomb,
44000	48000	which utilizes the energy stored in atomic nuclei as a source of energy.
48000	56000	The energy liberated in the explosion of such a super bomb is about the same as that produced by the explosion of 1,000 tons of dynamite.
56000	64000	This energy is liberated in a small volume in which it will, for an instant, produce a temperature comparable to that in the interior of the sun.
64000	68000	The blast from such an explosion would destroy life in a wide area.
68000	73000	The size of this area is difficult to estimate, but it will probably cover the center of a big city.
73000	80000	This report, written by two German-Jewish refugees in Britain by the names of Otto Robert Frisch and Rudolf Paels,
80000	89000	also detailed how such a super bomb could be made and explained how only around a pound or half a kilogram of uranium would be needed to make it.
104000	110000	Radioactive vapor and debris rose to five miles and lasted an hour before dispersing.
113000	115000	How did we get to this point?
115000	120000	How did science go from the discovery of the atom to unleashing its full power,
120000	125000	inevitably dragging us into the atomic age where we find ourselves today?
125000	129000	To answer that, we need to go back in time, way back.
134000	143000	In ancient times, people reverenced the sun as the god of health, sending life to earth dwellers.
145000	151000	Amazingly, the idea of the atom was first put forward around two and a half thousand years ago.
151000	156000	In the 5th century BC, the Greek philosopher Lucipus and his more famous student, Democritus,
156000	163000	proposed that the universe consists of two fundamental constituents, the void, or nothingness,
163000	168000	and tiny, solid, indestructible particles that cannot be broken down any further.
168000	172000	They called these particles atomos, meaning indivisible.
172000	176000	Democritus wrote that atoms and void are the only things that actually exist
176000	181000	and that all other things are only said to exist by social convention.
181000	186000	To illustrate this, imagine you're looking at a mountain made of trillions of specks of dust.
186000	192000	Now, is that actually a mountain that you see, or is that just what we as a society would call it?
192000	196000	Is it in fact just dust in a specific shape that we're giving the name mountain?
196000	202000	Can we even say with certainty that the mountain truly exists, or is it just the dust that exists?
202000	208000	The theory went that atoms were too small for humans to see, but they had different sizes and different shapes.
208000	211000	They were infinite in number and had always existed.
211000	216000	They could also combine together due to hooks or eyes on their surfaces, for example.
216000	222000	The combination of different types of atoms gives rise to the different forms of matter we see all around us.
222000	227000	The theory was most poetically summarized a few centuries later by the Roman philosopher Lucretius,
227000	231000	who wrote Dererum Natura, or On the Nature of Things.
231000	237000	He described how harder solids were composed of more hooked atoms to allow them to connect together more strongly,
237000	241000	and liquids were composed of smoother atoms which could move over each other.
241000	246000	He also described how pleasant flavors were caused by rounder atoms passing over the tongue,
246000	249000	and how bitterness was caused by more crooked atoms.
249000	255000	Combining these phenomena, he said that seawater was composed of smooth atoms to give it its fluidity,
255000	259000	and some rough ones mixed in to give it its bitter taste.
259000	264000	Now, there was no empirical evidence for any of this, just philosophical thought.
264000	268000	However, tiny particles of different sizes that make up matter,
268000	272000	bonds forming between those particles which can have different strengths,
272000	275000	different combinations of atoms forming different substances,
275000	279000	it's amazing how much they got right just by logical reasoning alone.
279000	282000	The philosophy became known as atomism,
282000	287000	and millennia later it was still supported by the founder of modern chemistry, Robert Boyle,
287000	290000	and by the founder of classical physics, Sir Isaac Newton.
290000	296000	But not everybody accepted the idea since there wasn't any actual evidence for any of it.
296000	315000	A particle so infinitely small that it takes over a hundred billion billion atoms to make up the head of a pin.
315000	319000	Today, the concept of the atom underpins all of modern chemistry.
319000	325000	It's amazing to think there was a time when chemistry was being done when we didn't know anything about the atom at all.
325000	331000	But by the end of the 18th century, two major laws in chemistry had already been established.
331000	337000	The first law was the law of conservation of mass, which was popularized by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier.
337000	344000	This law states that during a chemical reaction, the total mass of the products is equal to the total mass of the reactants.
344000	350000	The second law was the law of definite proportions, which was established by another French chemist, Joseph Proust.
351000	357000	This law states that a given compound always contains its constituent elements in a fixed ratio.
357000	366000	For example, water is always 8 ninths oxygen by mass and 1 ninth hydrogen by mass, regardless of the source of the water or how it was prepared.
366000	371000	Now, neither of these laws specifically required the existence of the atom.
371000	378000	However, in 1794, an English chemist called John Dalton joined the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester,
378000	382000	and he would go on to change the world of chemistry forever.
382000	389000	Dalton's very first paper for the society was called Extraordinary Facts relating to the vision of colors with observations.
389000	391000	In it, he described his own color blindness.
391000	393000	For instance, he said,
402000	409000	Now, this phenomenon had never been studied before, and Dalton single-handedly introduced the world to its existence.
409000	413000	In fact, many languages now call color blindness Daltonism.
413000	420000	In 1995, tissue from Dalton's preserved eyeball was analyzed to show that he would have been red-green colorblind.
420000	424000	But Dalton contributed a lot more than just an awareness of color blindness.
425000	430000	He was also a meteorologist and would climb England's highest peaks on multiple occasions to get measurements,
430000	433000	climbing Helvellen alone over 40 times.
433000	438000	Reading through Dalton's works, it seems like he was also fascinated by chemical ratios.
438000	444000	He would go on to establish a third fundamental law of chemistry, the law of multiple proportions.
444000	451000	This law states that if two elements can combine to form different compounds when the mass of the first element is held constant,
451000	458000	the ratios between the masses of the second element in the different compounds will always be ratios of small, whole numbers.
458000	461000	Okay, hold on. This will make more sense with an example.
461000	470000	In Dalton's 1808 publication, A New System of Chemical Philosophy, he describes the preparation and composition of hundreds of compounds.
470000	478000	In section 13, Metallic Oxides, he covers the two known oxides of copper, which he calls copper protoxide and copper deutoxide.
478000	483000	Today we know these as copper one oxide, where the copper ions all have a single positive charge,
483000	486000	and copper two oxide, where the copper ions have a two plus charge.
486000	492000	Dalton said that copper protoxide contains 12 and a half parts of oxygen to 100 parts of copper,
492000	497000	and that copper deutoxide contains 25 parts of oxygen to 100 parts of copper.
497000	505000	So, with a constant mass of copper, the ratio of oxygen in the two compounds is one to two, a simple whole number ratio.
505000	508000	This is what Dalton described in his Law of Multiple Proportions.
508000	515000	Now, this law does suggest the existence of atoms, because since elements combine in very specific ratios,
515000	521000	it implies that they consist of discrete individual particles that are combining in very specific ratios.
521000	526000	His interest in chemical ratios led him to develop atomic theory more than anyone before him.
526000	528000	Let's rewind a bit.
528000	534000	In 1803, Dalton published a paper called On the Absorption of Gases by Water and Other Liquids.
534000	539000	At the end of his paper, he casually included his first-ever table of relative atomic weights,
539000	542000	and it's actually really inaccurate.
542000	544000	However, this was an amazing first step.
544000	549000	The problem was, Dalton was using some faulty reasoning to work out these numbers.
549000	555000	Let's go back to Dalton's 1808 publication, A New System of Chemical Philosophy, where he explains this more.
555000	562000	Here, he goes into more detail about his atomic theory, and he established some rules about how he believed elements combined to form compounds.
562000	569000	There are many possible ways that they can combine, which Dalton labeled as binary, tarnary, quaternary, etc.
569000	576000	He thought that if only one compound could be formed between two elements, the molecule would always be binary.
576000	581000	Hence, he went on to deduce that water is a binary compound of hydrogen and oxygen,
581000	587000	and that ammonia is a binary compound of hydrogen and azote, which is the old name for nitrogen.
587000	589000	Unfortunately, this was all wrong.
589000	594000	He also had no way of recognizing that some elements could exist as diatomic molecules.
594000	601000	All of this meant that he simply wouldn't have been able to accurately calculate how heavy atoms were compared to each other.
601000	607000	He included a new list of relative weights here, which was updated from the previous table in his 1803 publication,
607000	611000	but it's still incorrect due to his faulty assumptions.
611000	614000	He also described how atoms were indestructible, saying,
614000	620000	We might as well attempt to introduce a new planet into the solar system or to annihilate one already in existence
620000	624000	as to create or destroy a particle of hydrogen.
624000	629000	However, a lot of the logic employed by Dalton's work was mostly very good.
629000	635000	Based on his experimentations and observations, he concluded that there must be individual particles that make up matter
635000	638000	and that atoms of a given element are identical to each other.
638000	642000	He described atoms combining in different ratios when reacting.
642000	647000	He talked about how atoms must be finite in number, contradicting the ancient philosophical theory
647000	650000	where they thought that atoms were infinite in number.
650000	655000	Dalton really got the ball rolling for our modern understanding of the atom.
655000	660000	Over the next few decades, other chemists did experiments to investigate the ratios between reacting elements
660000	664000	and more accurate relative masses were gradually discovered.
664000	669000	In 1815 and 1816, the English chemist William Prout published work where he observed that
669000	672000	of the relative atomic weights that had been determined so far,
672000	676000	they all seemed to be a whole number multiple of hydrogen.
676000	681000	He suggests that all other elements were essentially just clusters of hydrogen atoms.
681000	686000	He named this fundamental particle, Protile, from proto-heil or primary matter,
686000	692000	and said that hydrogen consisted of one Protile, helium of two, lithium of three, and so on.
692000	696000	This was the first suggestion of a particle that made up the atom.
696000	701000	However, the concept of the Protile was later disproved by the Swedish chemist, Johns Jacob Basilius,
701000	705000	who noticed that chlorine had a relative mass of 35.5.
705000	711000	It wasn't until the 1900s that the concept of isotopes was established to explain this phenomenon.
711000	713000	More on that later.
713000	717000	By the mid-1800s, many relative atomic masses had been accurately determined.
717000	724000	However, at this point, chemists still thought the atom was nothing more than a solid, indestructible sphere.
736000	742000	It is impossible to show the correct relative proportions of an atom on this screen.
742000	747000	For example, if an atom could be as large as the United States,
747000	752000	one of its electrons would be only about 100 feet across.
752000	757000	Therefore, to tell our story, we must resort to a symbol.
759000	764000	The English chemist Michael Faraday was famous for his work on electromagnetism and electrochemistry,
764000	767000	not to mention his fascinating discovery of benzene.
767000	770000	Make sure to check out my video on that for the full story.
771000	776000	Since he could cause reactions to happen using electric fields, as in electrolysis,
776000	781000	and induce electric currents from chemical reactions, as in voltaic cells,
781000	786000	this implied that electric charges were a significant part of the makeup of an atom.
786000	791000	His work suggested that atoms were more than just solid spheres of matter.
791000	795000	It wasn't until almost a century after Dalton's publications
795000	800000	that the first subatomic particle was finally discovered, the electron.
800000	804000	In 1897, an English physicist called Joseph John Thompson
804000	809000	published work where he investigated cathode rays, which were of interest to scientists at the time.
809000	814000	These were beautiful green fluorescent beams that were made by creating a potential difference
814000	818000	between two electrodes that had been sealed in a vacuum tube.
818000	822000	There was a debate in the scientific community as to what these rays actually were.
822000	827000	Some thought that they were waves as they traveled in straight lines and were unaffected by gravity.
827000	831000	Others thought they were charged particles as they could be deflected by a magnetic field.
831000	835000	In Thompson's publication, he described what happened as follows.
835000	838000	At high exhaustions, meaning very low pressure,
838000	844000	the rays were deflected when the two aluminium plates were connected with the terminals of a battery of small storage cells.
844000	849000	The rays were depressed when the upper plate was connected to the negative pole of the battery,
849000	854000	the lower with the positive, and raised when the upper plate was connected with the positive,
854000	856000	the lower with the negative pole.
856000	861000	Thompson demonstrated for the first time that cathode rays could be deflected by an electric field.
861000	863000	And not only that, with similar experiments,
863000	868000	he was able to show that these deflected rays could charge up the electrodes that they landed on.
868000	873000	Thus, he was able to confirm that they consisted of electrically charged particles.
873000	877000	And because the cathode rays were attracted to the positive electrode,
877000	881000	he was able to confirm that the particles must be negatively charged.
881000	885000	He also demonstrated that the deflection of cathode rays was exactly the same,
885000	887000	even if there were different gases present in the tube,
887000	890000	or if different materials were used for the electrodes.
890000	895000	This suggested that the negatively charged particles were identical in all these different substances.
895000	901000	The most interesting part of all of this, though, was Thompson's estimates for the size of these particles.
901000	905000	By measuring the radius of the curved path of the cathode rays
905000	907000	and the depth of heat they transferred to the electrodes,
907000	910000	he was able to use some very elegant calculations
910000	915000	to show that the particles were around a thousand times lighter than the hydrogen atom,
915000	919000	which, up until that time, was thought to be the smallest unit of matter.
919000	923000	Thompson called these tiny negatively charged particles corpuscles,
923000	927000	but they soon became known as electrons within the scientific community.
927000	933000	In 1904, Thompson published more work where he determined what the atom must look like
933000	936000	that includes these tiny negatively charged particles.
936000	941000	He described a model whereby negative electrons are embedded within a larger matrix
941000	945000	which must be positively charged since atoms are neutral overall.
945000	948000	This model became known as the plum pudding model,
948000	953000	with the plums representing the electrons and the rest of the pudding representing the positively charged matrix.
953000	957000	This plum pudding model is quite famous nowadays and is often taught in school.
957000	960000	However, not many people realise that in this same paper,
960000	966000	Thompson also put forward the notion that the electrons could be moving in orbits within the positive matrix.
966000	972000	He used a lot of maths to determine this, accounting for all the electrostatic attractions and repulsions involved,
972000	974000	and he described his idea as follows.
974000	979000	We have thus in the first place a sphere of uniform positive electrification,
979000	983000	and inside this sphere a number of corpuscles arranged in a series of parallel rings.
983000	987000	The number of the corpuscles in a ring varying from ring to ring.
987000	992000	Each corpuscle is travelling at a high speed around the circumference of the ring in which it is situated,
992000	997000	and the rings are so arranged that those which contain a large number of corpuscles are near the surface of the sphere,
997000	1002000	while those in which there are a smaller number of corpuscles are more in the inside.
1002000	1006000	Later, he even describes how rather than two-dimensional rings,
1006000	1009000	the electrons could move in three-dimensional shells,
1009000	1014000	saying, when the corpuscles are not constrained to one plane but can move about in all directions,
1014000	1018000	they will arrange themselves in a series of concentric shells.
1018000	1022000	For some reason, the idea of electron shells isn't commonly attributed to Thompson,
1022000	1028000	probably because when you hear plum pudding model, you don't tend to think about the plums whizzing around inside the pudding,
1028000	1031000	but it's right there in his 1904 paper.
1031000	1036000	Two years later, in 1906, Thompson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work.
1036000	1043000	Thompson was the first person to provide evidence that the atom was more complicated than Dalton originally thought.
1066000	1069000	At almost inconceivable speeds.
1072000	1075000	Just a few months after Thompson proposed his plum pudding model,
1075000	1081000	a Japanese physicist called Hantaro Nagaoka published a different proposition for the structure of the atom,
1081000	1086000	which had most of the mass of the atom located in a very small, positively charged point,
1086000	1089000	which was orbited by rings of negatively charged electrons.
1089000	1094000	This became known as the Saturnian model, as it somewhat resembled the rings of Saturn.
1094000	1098000	However, unlike Saturn, Nagaoka's model had a much smaller central point,
1098000	1103000	and he described the rings of electrons by saying that they may or may not lie in the same plane.
1103000	1107000	Sadly, Nagaoka's work has largely been forgotten by history,
1107000	1110000	but this was a remarkable improvement upon Thompson's model,
1110000	1117000	even though there were problems associated with the idea of having mutually repelling particles organized into two-dimensional rings,
1117000	1119000	which even Nagaoka himself acknowledged.
1119000	1124000	Now, like Nagaoka, Thompson was a great scientist, but he was also a great teacher.
1124000	1130000	One of his students, Ernest Rutherford, a New Zealander, was also awarded a Nobel Prize in 1908
1130000	1134000	for his investigations into radioactive substances like uranium,
1134000	1139000	where he found that they emit different types of radiation, which he named alpha, beta, and gamma.
1139000	1144000	He eventually determined that the alpha particles were just positively charged helium ions,
1144000	1147000	but it was difficult to explain where they had come from.
1147000	1153000	It was also soon found that the beta particles were electrons that had been emitted from the atoms.
1153000	1158000	Over the next couple of years, Rutherford and his colleagues, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marston,
1158000	1161000	did experiments into the structure of the atom.
1161000	1165000	In 1911, Rutherford published work where he outlined his findings.
1165000	1168000	Here's how his most famous experiment was set up.
1168000	1173000	A very thin sheet of gold foil was placed in the center of a circular screen.
1173000	1176000	A source of alpha particles was aimed at the gold foil.
1176000	1182000	The circular screen was fluorescent, so if an alpha particle hits it, it would light up where it was hit.
1182000	1187000	Now, by this point, it was known that alpha particles had a relatively strong positive charge,
1187000	1192000	so it was expected that they would just blast through the gold foil, pretty much undisturbed,
1192000	1198000	because the spread out positive charge of the plum pudding model wasn't concentrated enough to stop the alpha particles.
1198000	1201000	But what they actually observed was quite different.
1201000	1205000	Several of the alpha particles were deflected by a few degrees.
1205000	1208000	A smaller percentage were deflected by a larger angle,
1208000	1213000	and a very small percentage were deflected at much larger angles.
1213000	1216000	When describing this discovery in a later lecture,
1216000	1217000	Rutherford said,
1217000	1221000	It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life.
1221000	1228000	It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back to hit you.
1228000	1230000	Rutherford was saying that,
1230000	1236000	since most of the alpha particles weren't deflected, but a small percentage were deflected significantly,
1236000	1239000	this indicated that most of the atom is empty space,
1239000	1245000	and the majority of the mass of the atom must be concentrated in a very small region in the center.
1245000	1249000	That way, most of the alpha particles would fly straight through the empty space,
1249000	1254000	but the few that got close to this massive central region would be deflected.
1255000	1258000	So Rutherford was able to confirm the existence of a tiny,
1258000	1264000	positively charged particle of mass in the center of the atom, just like Nagaoka had predicted.
1264000	1269000	With the discovery of the nucleus, the field of nuclear physics was born.
1285000	1290000	Now observing the professor himself, we can see that his structure resembles,
1290000	1297000	in many ways, something almost as vast as the atom is small, the solar system,
1297000	1300000	and there are certain similarities.
1300000	1304000	This is the center with electrons in surrounding orbits.
1306000	1311000	Despite this amazing progress, there were still a couple of problems with Rutherford's nuclear model.
1311000	1315000	Firstly, based on the classical electromagnetism of the time,
1315000	1319000	it was known that accelerating charges emit electromagnetic waves.
1319000	1323000	This meant that the electrons should lose energy as they orbit,
1323000	1325000	eventually falling into the nucleus.
1325000	1331000	Secondly, the nuclear model had no way of explaining the interesting absorption spectra of different elements.
1331000	1337000	This is when you shine light through a substance, then pass the light through a prism to disperse it into a spectrum.
1337000	1344000	When we do this, we see these black lines on the spectrum where specific colors of light have been absorbed by the sample.
1344000	1351000	Different substances give us different spectra, so the light is clearly interacting with the atoms in a very specific way,
1351000	1354000	but nobody could explain why or how.
1354000	1359000	That was until a student of both Thompson and Rutherford came along to enlighten the world.
1359000	1365000	A Danish physicist called Niels Bohr published a brand new model for the atom in 1913.
1366000	1368000	Now, to give some background on Bohr's paper,
1368000	1372000	over the last few years, scientists like Max Planck and Albert Einstein
1372000	1377000	had established that light energy could only be absorbed or emitted in discrete quanta,
1377000	1382000	which could be described as particles of light that have very specific energies.
1382000	1385000	These light particles became known as photons,
1385000	1389000	and this quantum theory explained previously confusing phenomena,
1389000	1394000	like black body radiation or why hot objects glow the way they do.
1394000	1401000	And the photoelectric effect, or why light can liberate electrons from metallic surfaces in the way that it does.
1401000	1406000	Bohr realized that he could apply quantum theory to the electron orbits in the atom.
1406000	1412000	Now, quantum theory involves a huge amount of complicated maths, so I won't go through the calculations in this video,
1412000	1416000	but Bohr was able to calculate that electron orbits were quantized.
1416000	1420000	In other words, the electron orbits could only exist at discrete energy levels,
1420000	1426000	which manifested as orbits at specific distances from the nucleus, now known as shells.
1426000	1430000	In Bohr's model, electrons cannot exist in between these shells.
1430000	1436000	Quantization means that electrons can only exist in one of these strictly defined shells.
1436000	1441000	This explains why electrons don't spiral into the nucleus, because they physically can't.
1441000	1444000	They can only exist in these shells.
1444000	1450000	If an electron absorbs a photon of the exact energy of the difference between two energy levels,
1450000	1455000	it will instantaneously jump up to the next one without spending any time in between.
1455000	1460000	When it instantaneously jumps back down, it'll emit the photon again.
1460000	1463000	For bigger jumps, higher energy photons are required.
1463000	1469000	This explains the black lines that can be seen on the absorbent spectra for different elements.
1469000	1477000	They're the exact frequencies of light that correspond to the very specific electron transitions for that element.
1477000	1482000	Bohr's atom is a great model, and it's not too far away from our modern understanding of the atom.
1482000	1488000	In fact, it's still taught in schools today, since it's a beautiful simplification of the behaviour of the electrons.
1488000	1492000	There were still problems with Bohr's model that were apparent at the time.
1492000	1500000	It was able to explain the hydrogen spectra, but it failed to accurately predict the spectra observed by elements that contained multiple electrons.
1500000	1502000	Something else was going on.
1502000	1507000	We know now that the electrons in a real atom are a bit stranger.
1522000	1529000	There are different members, each one having the same number of protons, but differing in the number of neutrons.
1529000	1535000	The total of an atom's protons and neutrons is its atomic weight.
1535000	1544000	Thus, in natural uranium we have U234, U235, and U238.
1544000	1551000	These different members of the same element or atom family, science calls isotopes.
1552000	1562000	Returning to the nucleus, at this point there was still not much known about it, other than the fact that it was very small compared to the size of the atom and that it was positively charged.
1562000	1569000	In the same year that Bohr published his atomic model, an English chemist called Frederick Soddy and a Polish chemist called Kazimierz Fajans,
1569000	1577000	both of whom were colleagues of Rutherford, independently discovered precisely how elements change after different types of nuclear decay.
1577000	1589000	For instance, after emitting an alpha particle, an element is created with an atomic number that has reduced by 2 and a mass number that has reduced by 4 compared to the original element.
1589000	1597000	After emitting a beta particle, an element is created with an atomic number that has increased by 1 while the mass number has remained unchanged.
1597000	1608000	Soddy then went on to demonstrate how, with one alpha decay and two beta decays, you would end up with an element that has the same atomic number as the original element, but with a different mass number.
1608000	1615000	These two forms of the same element would have identical chemical properties and would be very difficult to separate.
1615000	1623000	When he told a family friend, Margaret Todd, about his research, she suggested the name isotope, which was Greek for at the same place.
1623000	1630000	In reference to how these different forms of the same element would appear in the same place as each other on the periodic table.
1630000	1637000	Soddy liked the name and it stuck. He would later go on to win the Nobel Prize for his discovery of isotopes.
1637000	1646000	Still in the same year, Thompson published a description of an interesting experiment whereby he passed a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields
1646000	1650000	and observed how they were deflected by placing photography paper in their path.
1651000	1657000	Thompson was able to use these deflections to calculate the mass to charge ratios of the deflected particles.
1657000	1659000	He explained this as follows.
1659000	1667000	There can therefore, I think, be little doubts that what has been called neon is not a simple gas, but a mixture of two gases.
1667000	1672000	One of which has an atomic weight about 20 and the other about 22.
1672000	1682000	The parabola due to the heavier gas is always much fainter than that due to the lighter, so that probably the heavier gas forms only a small percentage of the mixture.
1682000	1691000	A few years after Thompson's discoveries, another English chemist called Francis William Aston would develop Thompson's mass spectrograph experiment further
1691000	1694000	into a technique that became known as mass spectrometry.
1694000	1699000	Check out my video on mass spectrometry if you want to learn how all this would be done today.
1700000	1707000	Aston used this technique to show that many other elements can also have different isotopes and eventually won the Nobel Prize for his work.
1707000	1715000	He published mass spectrographs of different elements, including ones where you can also see the two isotopes of neon just like Thompson had shown in his paper.
1715000	1724000	So, since it was discovered that atoms of the same element can have different masses, this indicated that there was something more complicated going on in the nucleus.
1729000	1741000	The electrons which are negative are attracted by the protons which are positive and vice versa.
1743000	1751000	Still in 1913, the year of Bohr's publication, a brilliant English physicist called Henry Mosley, who was another student of Rutherford,
1751000	1758000	published work where he described firing x-rays at different elements and observing the spectra that they produced, and he found something interesting.
1758000	1769000	He noticed that the frequency of the x-rays produced followed a very predictable pattern whereby the square root of the x-ray frequency is proportional to the number of electrons in the atom.
1769000	1774000	A year later in 1914, Mosley published another paper.
1774000	1785000	Mosley said in this paper that there is every reason to suppose that the integer which controls the x-ray spectrum is the same as the number of electrical units in the nucleus.
1785000	1791000	In other words, he said that the atomic number is the number of positive charges in the nucleus.
1791000	1801000	This was the first ever hint at the existence of the proton and it was amazing work, but sadly this would turn out to be the final publication Mosley ever produced.
1801000	1809000	Shortly afterwards, the First World War broke out and Mosley enlisted with the Royal Engineers, where he served as a technical officer.
1810000	1816000	A year later, he was killed at the age of 27 by a sniper at the Battle of Gallipoli.
1816000	1821000	Mosley was a brilliant scientist who Rutherford believed would have gone on to win a Nobel Prize.
1821000	1832000	Isaac Asimov, one of the most famous sci-fi authors of the 20th century, said of Mosley that his death might well have been the most costly single death of the war to mankind generally.
1832000	1835000	Niels Bohr said in an interview years later,
1835000	1841000	The Rutherford work was not taken seriously. We cannot understand it today, but it was not taken seriously at all.
1841000	1846000	There was no mention of it in any place. The great change came from Mosley.
1846000	1854000	It really seems like Mosley would have gone on to be hugely influential in the world of science, but he was unfortunately lost too soon.
1855000	1868000	Rutherford continued along the path that Mosley had started, and several years later he published multiple papers where he described how firing alpha particles through nitrogen resulted in the formation of hydrogen nuclei.
1868000	1875000	Rutherford was able to explain that these hydrogen nuclei must have been knocked out of the nitrogen nuclei by the alpha particles,
1875000	1881000	and so he was able to determine that they were a fundamental building block of the atomic nucleus.
1881000	1889000	Remember about a hundred years before all this when William Prout suggested that all the elements heavier than hydrogen were just clusters of hydrogen atoms,
1889000	1893000	and he gave these fundamental particles the name Protile?
1893000	1901000	Well, Rutherford was inspired by Prout to give a name to the positively charged hydrogen nucleus that he had found inside the nuclei of other elements.
1901000	1906000	Instead of Protile, he gave this particle the name Proton, and the name stuck.
1906000	1911000	And with that, the first ever nuclear particle had been identified.
1911000	1931000	The electrons always try to get from a negatively charged body to one that is positively charged in relation to it.
1932000	1943000	In 1924, the French physicist Louis de Broglie built on Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect where it was discovered that light can behave as both a wave and a particle.
1943000	1949000	De Broglie posited that not only can light behave as a particle, but matter can also behave as a wave,
1949000	1956000	and he formed an equation that connected a wave property, wavelength, to a matter property, momentum.
1956000	1960000	His equation suggests that all matter has a wavelength.
1960000	1963000	This means that even you and I have wavelengths of our own.
1963000	1968000	The thing is though, according to this equation, the bigger the mass, the smaller the wavelength.
1968000	1971000	So the wavelength of a person is completely negligible.
1971000	1976000	However, an electron is so tiny that its wavelength becomes significant.
1976000	1981000	So not only can it behave as a particle, it can behave as a wave.
1981000	1988000	This was proved experimentally a few years later by two separate groups who independently performed very similar experiments.
1988000	1995000	One group was led by the English physicist George Padgett Thompson, the son of Joseph John Thompson who discovered the electron.
1995000	1999000	The other group was led by the American physicist Clinton Davison.
1999000	2009000	Each team fired electrons at different materials and managed to observe a diffraction pattern, something very specific to waves that ordinary particles cannot do.
2009000	2015000	And so they observed for the first time electrons actually behaving as waves.
2015000	2020000	Soon after Dubois published his theory of the wave particle duality of electrons,
2020000	2030000	Austrian physicist Owen Schrodinger investigated whether the movement of an orbiting electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than a particle.
2030000	2034000	And he got to work determining an equation to describe this wave system.
2034000	2043000	In 1926, he published his findings across multiple papers where he defined an equation that describes these wave-like electrons in the atom.
2043000	2045000	Let's look at how this works.
2045000	2048000	Imagine a guitar string that's connected at two ends.
2048000	2055000	If we pluck the string, we get a standing wave which, rather than progressing along the string, vibrates in place.
2055000	2060000	Schrodinger said that electrons orbit the atom as circular standing waves.
2060000	2066000	This means that we can only get an integer number of wavelengths that can exist around that circle.
2067000	2075000	Since a wave's energy is related to its wavelength, this explains why only specific energy levels are allowed according to Bohr's model.
2075000	2080000	However, the problem with Bohr's model was that he viewed the electrons solely as particles.
2080000	2085000	This new wave theory helped to explain the quantization of the energy levels.
2085000	2090000	Now, the equation that Schrodinger established contained something called imaginary numbers,
2090000	2094000	meaning it couldn't correspond to something that was measurable in the real world.
2094000	2100000	However, this problem was solved by German physicist Max Born, who was another student of Thomson.
2100000	2109000	Born believed that the square of Schrodinger's wave function was related to the probability of finding an electron at a specific distance from the nucleus.
2109000	2115000	This allowed scientists to use these wave functions to model complicated three-dimensional orbitals,
2115000	2121000	which are overlapping regions of space around the nucleus where you're likely to find different electrons.
2121000	2127000	And this new orbital theory was much better at predicting the observed spectra of different atoms.
2127000	2132000	Another German physicist, Werner Heisenberg, who was a student of both Bohr and Born,
2132000	2137000	quickly identified a strange consequence of these probability distributions.
2137000	2143000	Essentially, he realized that since electrons are not simple particles in space but behave more like waves,
2143000	2149000	it's impossible to measure both an electron's position and its velocity with a high degree of certainty.
2149000	2154000	This is because a wave cannot have a specific position in space like a particle can.
2154000	2161000	The more precisely you know the position of an electron, the less precisely you can know its velocity and vice versa.
2161000	2165000	This became known as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
2165000	2174000	De Bruy, Schrodinger, Born, Heisenberg, Davidson and Thomson would all go on to win Nobel Prizes for their work.
2174000	2180000	Interestingly, this meant that Joseph John Thomson won the Nobel Prize for proving the electron was a particle,
2180000	2186000	and his son, George Paget Thomson, won the Nobel Prize for proving that it was also a wave.
2186000	2193000	And so the more scientists learned about the quantum nature of the electron, the more bizarre our very reality became.
2193000	2198000	The true nature of matter is one of probabilities and uncertainties.
2198000	2202000	If you're finding this confusing, that's fine, so does everybody else.
2202000	2207000	Physics of the quantum world is a lot less concrete than the world we can see around us.
2207000	2224000	But here in the nucleus are other particles with no electrical charge called neutrons.
2224000	2228000	Very important characters too, as we shall see.
2228000	2233000	Thanks to Mosley and Rutherford, it was now known how many protons were in each atom.
2233000	2242000	And since a proton is just a hydrogen nucleus, in theory we could just multiply the mass of the hydrogen nucleus up to get the mass of every other element's nucleus.
2242000	2249000	But that didn't work. Most atoms were found to be around twice as heavy as the mass of their protons.
2249000	2253000	This implied there must be another type of particle in the nucleus.
2253000	2263000	Rutherford had previously attempted to explain this in 1920 by describing clusters of protons with electrons bound to them in order to balance the charge.
2263000	2267000	He suggested that atomic nuclei were built from these clusters.
2267000	2279000	He also described an atom of mass one which has zero nucleus charge, which was formed from the coupling of one hydrogen nucleus, a proton, with an electron.
2279000	2284000	This idea of nuclear electrons was fiercely debated throughout the 1920s.
2284000	2294000	One big issue with this idea was that if we know an electron is confined to a region the size of an atomic nucleus, this gives us a high certainty of its position.
2294000	2300000	So according to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the certainty of its velocity will be very low.
2300000	2309000	This means when electrons are emitted from the nucleus, as they are with beta radiation, they should have a broad range of kinetic energies,
2309000	2315000	including energies that are much larger than what's actually observed when beta particles are emitted from the nucleus.
2315000	2323000	In 1930, Volta Botter and Herbert Becker bombarded samples of beryllium, boron and lithium with alpha particles,
2323000	2328000	and they noticed that this caused the samples to emit an unusual form of radiation.
2328000	2332000	It was unaffected by electric fields, meaning it must be uncharged.
2332000	2341000	This initially led scientists to think that it was gamma rays, but they quickly noticed that this new type of radiation was much more penetrating than gamma rays were.
2341000	2350000	Two years later, in 1932, Irene and Frederic Joliot-Curie noticed that when this new type of radiation was directed at paraffin wax,
2350000	2354000	it caused the wax to shoot out very high energy protons.
2354000	2364000	It was soon realized that since gamma rays are waves, not particles, they would need to have a ridiculous amount of energy if they were to knock a proton out of an atom in this way.
2364000	2370000	This indicated that some kind of heavy particle was colliding with the proton instead.
2370000	2376000	The Joliot-Curie's would go on to win a Nobel Prize for their work on induced radioactivity.
2376000	2382000	Fun fact, these two were the second married couple ever to be jointly awarded a Nobel Prize.
2382000	2387000	The first married couple was Irene's parents, Pierre-Curie and Marie-Squadowska-Curie,
2387000	2391000	who won their joint Nobel Prize for their own work on radioactivity.
2391000	2397000	Here's another fun fact, Marie-Squadowska-Curie was the first ever woman to win a Nobel Prize,
2397000	2405000	as well as being the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields.
2405000	2408000	So this was a pretty impressive family.
2409000	2414000	News of the Joliot-Curie experiments quickly reached yet another of Rutherford's students,
2414000	2420000	an English physicist called James Chadwick, and he got straight to work recreating it in his own lab.
2420000	2425000	Not only was he successful, he was able to measure the speed of the emitted particles,
2425000	2431000	as well as the inexplicably large amount of recoil they caused when they collided with other atoms.
2431000	2434000	In his preliminary paper, Possible Existence of a Neutron,
2434000	2439000	he said that his results were difficult to explain if this was gamma radiation being emitted,
2439000	2449000	but the difficulties disappear, however, if it is to be assumed that the radiation consists of particles of mass 1 and charge 0, or neutrons.
2449000	2453000	This explained the high recoil of the atoms they collided with,
2453000	2457000	since an uncharged neutron would not be repelled by the nucleus it's approaching,
2457000	2462000	and therefore it can collide with a much greater impact than a proton would be able to.
2462000	2469000	A few months later, he followed this up with another publication, The Existence of a Neutron, where he confirmed his findings.
2469000	2472000	With some careful experimentation and thorough calculations,
2472000	2478000	he was able to determine that the neutron had a relative mass that was slightly higher than that of the proton.
2478000	2479000	He said,
2479000	2486000	Allowing for the errors in the mass measurements, it appears that the mass of the neutron cannot be less than 1.003,
2486000	2491000	and that it probably lies between 1.005 and 1.008.
2491000	2497000	Such a value for the mass of the neutron is to be expected if the neutron consists of a proton and an electron,
2497000	2500000	and it lends strong support to this view.
2500000	2504000	This work disproved the existence of nuclear electrons,
2504000	2510000	and therefore scientists came to realize that beta particles must form in the instant that they're emitted.
2510000	2515000	What they deduced is that they form when a neutron splits to give a proton and an electron.
2515000	2520000	The proton stays in the nucleus, which is why the atomic number goes up by one,
2520000	2523000	but the electron is instantly emitted.
2523000	2528000	Three years after these publications, Chadwick won the Nobel Prize for his work.
2528000	2532000	With the discovery of the neutron, the full structure of the atom had been discovered,
2532000	2535000	and the world would never be the same again.
2558000	2572000	Since neutrons were much better at firing at atomic nuclei than protons,
2572000	2576000	a huge amount of research went into observing these collisions.
2576000	2580000	In 1938, two German chemists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann,
2580000	2584000	were performing an experiment where they bombarded uranium with neutrons,
2584000	2586000	and they observed something strange.
2586000	2591000	After the bombardment, they found that some of their sample had turned into barium.
2591000	2595000	Now, the barium nucleus is significantly smaller than the uranium nucleus,
2595000	2599000	so it seemed preposterous that it could have formed from normal alpha decay.
2599000	2605000	Just a couple of months later, Austrian physicist Lisa Meitner and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch
2605000	2611000	published a theoretical proof that Hahn and Strassmann had successfully split the uranium nucleus.
2611000	2614000	Nuclear fission had been achieved.
2614000	2619000	The process released a huge amount of energy, and it was quickly realized that it could be used for power plants,
2619000	2622000	or it could be used for weapons.
2624000	2628000	Let's slow down that fission a million or so times.
2628000	2633000	A single particle starts the reaction, splitting the uranium atom.
2633000	2638000	Here now is the release of energy as heat and blast.
2638000	2643000	Here are powerful rays being given off, similar to X-rays.
2643000	2648000	But here, here are free neutrons driven out with tremendous speed,
2648000	2655000	and provided there is sufficient U-235 present, what science calls a critical mass,
2655000	2662000	those neutrons bombard other uranium atoms, causing them to split and split still others.
2662000	2666000	The result? A chain reaction.
2666000	2672000	Over a million billion billion atoms exploding within two seconds.
2673000	2679000	Shortly after the discovery of nuclear fission, Hitler invaded Poland and the Second World War began.
2679000	2685000	Many of the German scientists who were leaders in the field of nuclear physics also happened to be Jewish,
2685000	2691000	so they had been forced to flee their home country throughout the 1930s and many of them ended up in Britain.
2691000	2694000	One of these refugees was Otto Robert Frisch.
2694000	2700000	He ended up at the University of Birmingham and was later joined by another physicist by the name of Rudolf Piles.
2700000	2704000	In March 1940, the two published the Frisch Piles Memorandum,
2704000	2709000	where they described for the first time the feasibility of creating an atomic bomb.
2709000	2711000	In their report they said,
2711000	2715000	We have no information that the same idea has also occurred to other scientists,
2715000	2719000	but since all the theoretical data bearing on this problem are published,
2719000	2724000	it is quite conceivable that Germany is in fact developing this weapon.
2724000	2729000	If one works on the assumption that Germany is or will be in the possession of this weapon,
2729000	2735000	it must be realized that no shelters are available that would be effective and that could be used on a large scale.
2735000	2741000	The most effective reply would be a counter threat with a similar bomb.
2741000	2748000	And so two and a half thousand years of philosophical thought and scientific breakthroughs had inevitably led here
2748000	2752000	to an atomic arms race unlike anything the world had ever seen.
2752000	2757000	In Britain, an atomic weapons development project codenamed Tube Alloys was established.
2757000	2762000	With George Padgett-Thompson and James Chadwick as two of its founding members.
2762000	2767000	Shortly afterwards, the United States began their own program led by J. Robert Oppenheimer,
2767000	2769000	which became known as the Manhattan Project.
2769000	2776000	Progress in the United States eventually overtook Britain's and in 1943 the two nations signed the Quebec Agreement,
2776000	2781000	which allowed the Manhattan Project to subsume the Tube Alloys so the two could share their research.
2782000	2792000	Finally, at 5.29 a.m. on the 16th of July 1945, the world's first ever atomic bomb was detonated in a test in New Mexico.
2792000	2800000	The site of the test was the Jornada del Muerto Desert, a name given to it by Spanish conquistadors, meaning dead man's journey.
2800000	2804000	A perfect name considering the journey the atom has been on all these centuries,
2804000	2808000	culminating in a potentially world-ending superweapon.
2808000	2813000	Less than a month after the test, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
2813000	2820000	Ever since, humans have lived in a society under the continual threat of a possible nuclear attack.
2820000	2825000	Perhaps this was simply an inevitability of scientific progress.
2825000	2833000	Despite the bleakness of all this, what I find fascinating and even inspiring about this story is how it perfectly encapsulates how science works.
2833000	2838000	Each model of the atom was the best answer to the evidence that was available at the time.
2838000	2842000	When new evidence was discovered, the model had to change to keep up.
2842000	2845000	Science works because of its malleability.
2845000	2854000	Yes, it brought us along an inevitable path into the atomic age, but maybe, just maybe, it'll be able to bring us back out again.
2863000	2866000	Go in the comments if you have any questions, and I'll see you in the next one.
