1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
So let's jump straight in. First of all, this is how a cycle of fifths sounds.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,280
It's a very strong chord progression. It originates in classical music and basically every

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,760
anytime you resolve a chord down a fifth, that's a very strong resolution for a chord. So

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,640
it's always moving somewhere.

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:47,840
So first of all, there are two kinds of cycle of fifths. First of all, there's a perfect

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,200
cycle of fifths, which is where you go down a perfect fifth every time. And when you do that,

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,000
it will take you through all 12 notes on the keyboard. So if I start at C.

8
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,800
So it's a long progression. 12 chords is a long time. And for that reason,

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,920
the perfect cycle of fifths is hardly ever used in music. It's kind of a, it's interesting to

10
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,440
know about, but actually anytime you hear a cycle of fifths, it will usually be the other type of

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,920
cycle of fifths, which is called a diatonic cycle of fifths. First of all, the term diatonic

12
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,720
just means major or minor. So it refers to pieces of music that are in the major or minor scale.

13
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:56,960
And that's most of popular music, most of classical music up until the 20th century.

14
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Most music was being written in major or minor scales. So for a diatonic cycle of fifths,

15
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,000
you go down a fifth each time, but you keep it within the scale that you're in. So if it's a major

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,320
scale or a minor scale, so in C minor, we'll start going down fifths within the scale. So

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
let's go down a fifth within the scale.

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,760
F minor.

19
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,480
B flat major.

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,760
E flat major. All perfect fifths so far.

21
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,640
So here we have an A flat major, and if we were to go down a perfect fifth,

22
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,680
we'd get D flat major, but that's not in the key of C minor. And to play a D flat major

23
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,760
would be a perfect cycle of fifths. But here we're talking about a diatonic cycle of fifths,

24
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,400
so we're going to keep it in the scale, count down five notes within the scale,

25
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:21,520
gives us a D diminished, and then count down a fifth from D, gives us another perfect fifth to G,

26
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,360
eventually resolving to C minor. So here's how the diatonic cycle of fifths sounds.

27
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:54,080
So in a diatonic cycle of fifths in classical music, the character of the chord, whether it's

28
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:01,120
major or minor, is dictated by the key, and all you do is count up in thirds to build a chord,

29
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,120
and whatever notes are in that scale will dictate whether it's a major or minor chord.

30
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:16,960
So in C minor, one chord is going to be a minor chord. Now if we go to F and build a chord within

31
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:27,040
the scale of C minor, we'll give us a flat three and a five, so it'll dictate that it's an F minor

32
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,320
chord. And now let's build a triad of the B flat. What kind of third do you have in the scale of

33
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:44,000
C minor? You'll have a natural D and a natural F, so you get a B flat major chord. Then an E flat,

34
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,600
building off D, what do we get?

35
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:59,040
B and F for the third, then up another third, we would have an A flat, so that's a D diminished triad,

36
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:09,120
and then the G, it would actually be a G minor chord, because C minor has a B flat,

37
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,480
but what's common in classical music and all music is to make that last chord just an exception

38
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,160
for a really strong resolution. We make it a G major, or if you're playing a seventh,

39
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,240
a G dominant seven, and that resolves down a fifth to the one chord.

40
00:06:40,000 --> 00:07:02,240
But why is it so popular with composers? Well, a diatonic cycle of fifths is seven chords,

41
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,200
because it goes through each note of the scale, and there are seven notes in a scale.

42
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:19,920
So it's a great way of filling up some time, and usually in music we write eight bar phrases,

43
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,560
so what it means you can do is have one chord sustained for each bar, and that will give you a

44
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:32,880
seven bar chord progression, but then what's usual is to double the one chord, and they usually double

45
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,240
it, either playing it twice at the end, just to establish that one chord, or they start with the

46
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,200
one chord, and they end on the one chord, so...

47
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:14,640
So what's common with composers is they'll just come up with a melodic phrase that goes over two of the chords,

48
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,200
and then it's just great because then they can just transpose that same melodic phrase over

49
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:33,520
each chord progression, each two chord cell.

50
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,720
So a two five one, which is the most common chord progression in jazz, is actually just the final

51
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
three chords of a cycle of fifths, whether you're playing in the major scale,

52
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,520
or the minor scale,

53
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,200
and another chord progression you'll probably see a lot in jazz is not two five one, but six two five

54
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,160
one, and a six two five one is just the last four chords in a cycle of fifths, so six two five one

55
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:27,600
in C major would be A minor, D minor, G dominant seven, C major seven.

56
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,080
So a cycle of fifths in jazz will be the same, it will usually be a diatonic cycle of fifths,

57
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,280
so you get seven chord sequence, and really the main difference is that we're going to add some

58
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,520
extensions, so instead of just playing triads, which I've mainly done up till now, we're going to add

59
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:03,200
a seventh, maybe a ninth.

60
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:26,240
So straight away that sounds more harmonically rich, with these extended harmony notes,

61
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,000
sevenths and the ninths, but it doesn't sound that jazzy, does it, because it's all still

62
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,040
within the scale, and here's how we really make things sound more interesting.

63
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Let's start adding notes that are outside the scale of C minor.

64
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,680
Got a flat nine on that F, the G flat,

65
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:03,200
a flat nine on E flat, so the F flat, also known as an E.

66
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:37,200
So now we've laid down all the groundwork, let's have some fun and think about some patterns and how

67
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,480
we can use them in a jazz context. So if you watch my video on tritone substitution, you'll

68
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,440
know how you can substitute any dominant seven chord you see, you can play a dominant seven chord

69
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,600
that's a tritone away, so let's try using this principle and applying it to our cycle of fifths,

70
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,840
well every dominant seven chord we see, we're going to play the dominant seven chord a tritone away,

71
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:14,160
C minor seven, instead of F dominant seven, we'll play a B dominant seven,

72
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:25,440
which resolves the same way as an F dominant seven would down to B flat major. Now we would have an

73
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,160
E flat dominant seven, let's tritone substitute it, you'll get an A dominant seven,

74
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:50,560
and basically you're going to get a chromatic moving bass line going down.

75
00:12:50,800 --> 00:13:00,960
So that's a very nice pattern you can play. So now we come to my final pattern that I'm going to

76
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:07,040
talk about today, possibly my favorite of the patterns in the cycle of fifths, basically we're

77
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,920
going to do a series of two fives, so the last chords in the two five one.

78
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:32,160
So I do this a lot in my compositions, a lot of the chord progressions, I'll use this device.

79
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:53,360
So start with a two five one in C would be D minor seven to G dominant seven.

80
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,680
Now we're going to do another two five one, a half step down from C, so the two chord will be

81
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:12,800
a C sharp minor seven, and the five chord will be an F sharp dominant seven, and we'll keep doing this pattern so

82
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,240
okay.
