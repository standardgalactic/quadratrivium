1. The cycle of fifths is a harmonic sequence where each chord is a perfect fifth lower than the previous one. In classical music, this progression can be quite long as it encompasses all 12 notes chromatically, but in popular music, a more practical version known as the diatonic cycle of fifths is typically used.
   
2. The diatonic cycle of fifths stays within the key center and only includes chords that are part of the diatonic scale (major or minor). This means it cycles through seven chords, each a perfect fifth apart, corresponding to the seven notes in a scale.

3. In a diatonic cycle of fifths in the key of C minor, for example, the chords would be:
   - C minor
   - F minor
   - B♭ major
   - E♭ major
   - Ab major
   - D minor
   - G dominant seventh (G7)
   - Back to C minor (or Cmajor if starting in C major)

4. Jazz musicians often use a diatonic cycle of fifths as well, but they tend to add extended harmony by including chord extensions like sevenths and ninths, which makes the progression sound more harmonically rich.

5. Tritone substitution is a common technique in jazz where any dominant seventh chord in a cycle of fifths is replaced with its tritone substitute, creating a chromatic descent in the bass line.

6. Another pattern often used in jazz from the cycle of fifths is the two-five-one pattern, which takes the last three chords of the cycle (V7, i7, and IV in Roman numerals) and can be transposed across the keyboard. This pattern is very common in jazz and can be found in many standards.

7. The two-five-one pattern can also be modulated by half steps to create a descending bass line while maintaining the same chord quality, providing a sense of continuity and smooth transitions between keys.

In summary, the cycle of fifths is a fundamental harmonic concept that is adapted for use in various musical styles, including classical and jazz. It provides a framework for creating harmonically satisfying progressions that can be transposed and embellished to suit different musical contexts and compositional intentions.
