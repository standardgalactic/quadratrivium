00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
So let's jump straight in. First of all, this is how a cycle of fifths sounds.

00:11.600 --> 00:17.280
It's a very strong chord progression. It originates in classical music and basically every

00:18.720 --> 00:25.760
anytime you resolve a chord down a fifth, that's a very strong resolution for a chord. So

00:27.520 --> 00:28.640
it's always moving somewhere.

00:30.560 --> 00:47.840
So first of all, there are two kinds of cycle of fifths. First of all, there's a perfect

00:48.400 --> 00:55.200
cycle of fifths, which is where you go down a perfect fifth every time. And when you do that,

00:55.600 --> 01:02.000
it will take you through all 12 notes on the keyboard. So if I start at C.

01:17.680 --> 01:22.800
So it's a long progression. 12 chords is a long time. And for that reason,

01:22.800 --> 01:27.920
the perfect cycle of fifths is hardly ever used in music. It's kind of a, it's interesting to

01:27.920 --> 01:33.440
know about, but actually anytime you hear a cycle of fifths, it will usually be the other type of

01:33.440 --> 01:39.920
cycle of fifths, which is called a diatonic cycle of fifths. First of all, the term diatonic

01:40.480 --> 01:46.720
just means major or minor. So it refers to pieces of music that are in the major or minor scale.

01:47.440 --> 01:56.960
And that's most of popular music, most of classical music up until the 20th century.

01:58.320 --> 02:04.320
Most music was being written in major or minor scales. So for a diatonic cycle of fifths,

02:04.320 --> 02:10.000
you go down a fifth each time, but you keep it within the scale that you're in. So if it's a major

02:10.000 --> 02:16.320
scale or a minor scale, so in C minor, we'll start going down fifths within the scale. So

02:18.400 --> 02:20.640
let's go down a fifth within the scale.

02:25.120 --> 02:25.760
F minor.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.480
B flat major.

02:33.200 --> 02:39.760
E flat major. All perfect fifths so far.

02:45.520 --> 02:50.640
So here we have an A flat major, and if we were to go down a perfect fifth,

02:51.840 --> 02:57.680
we'd get D flat major, but that's not in the key of C minor. And to play a D flat major

02:58.480 --> 03:03.760
would be a perfect cycle of fifths. But here we're talking about a diatonic cycle of fifths,

03:03.760 --> 03:08.400
so we're going to keep it in the scale, count down five notes within the scale,

03:12.640 --> 03:21.520
gives us a D diminished, and then count down a fifth from D, gives us another perfect fifth to G,

03:22.080 --> 03:29.360
eventually resolving to C minor. So here's how the diatonic cycle of fifths sounds.

03:29.360 --> 03:54.080
So in a diatonic cycle of fifths in classical music, the character of the chord, whether it's

03:54.080 --> 04:01.120
major or minor, is dictated by the key, and all you do is count up in thirds to build a chord,

04:02.400 --> 04:07.120
and whatever notes are in that scale will dictate whether it's a major or minor chord.

04:07.120 --> 04:16.960
So in C minor, one chord is going to be a minor chord. Now if we go to F and build a chord within

04:17.040 --> 04:27.040
the scale of C minor, we'll give us a flat three and a five, so it'll dictate that it's an F minor

04:27.040 --> 04:34.320
chord. And now let's build a triad of the B flat. What kind of third do you have in the scale of

04:34.320 --> 04:44.000
C minor? You'll have a natural D and a natural F, so you get a B flat major chord. Then an E flat,

04:44.960 --> 04:47.600
building off D, what do we get?

04:50.560 --> 04:59.040
B and F for the third, then up another third, we would have an A flat, so that's a D diminished triad,

05:01.200 --> 05:09.120
and then the G, it would actually be a G minor chord, because C minor has a B flat,

05:09.360 --> 05:16.480
but what's common in classical music and all music is to make that last chord just an exception

05:17.280 --> 05:24.160
for a really strong resolution. We make it a G major, or if you're playing a seventh,

05:25.520 --> 05:32.240
a G dominant seven, and that resolves down a fifth to the one chord.

06:40.000 --> 07:02.240
But why is it so popular with composers? Well, a diatonic cycle of fifths is seven chords,

07:02.240 --> 07:07.200
because it goes through each note of the scale, and there are seven notes in a scale.

07:09.120 --> 07:19.920
So it's a great way of filling up some time, and usually in music we write eight bar phrases,

07:19.920 --> 07:24.560
so what it means you can do is have one chord sustained for each bar, and that will give you a

07:24.560 --> 07:32.880
seven bar chord progression, but then what's usual is to double the one chord, and they usually double

07:32.880 --> 07:40.240
it, either playing it twice at the end, just to establish that one chord, or they start with the

07:40.240 --> 07:43.200
one chord, and they end on the one chord, so...

08:02.960 --> 08:14.640
So what's common with composers is they'll just come up with a melodic phrase that goes over two of the chords,

08:17.520 --> 08:23.200
and then it's just great because then they can just transpose that same melodic phrase over

08:23.200 --> 08:33.520
each chord progression, each two chord cell.

08:43.920 --> 08:50.720
So a two five one, which is the most common chord progression in jazz, is actually just the final

08:50.800 --> 08:54.800
three chords of a cycle of fifths, whether you're playing in the major scale,

08:58.160 --> 08:59.520
or the minor scale,

09:04.320 --> 09:11.200
and another chord progression you'll probably see a lot in jazz is not two five one, but six two five

09:11.200 --> 09:18.160
one, and a six two five one is just the last four chords in a cycle of fifths, so six two five one

09:18.160 --> 09:27.600
in C major would be A minor, D minor, G dominant seven, C major seven.

09:37.280 --> 09:42.080
So a cycle of fifths in jazz will be the same, it will usually be a diatonic cycle of fifths,

09:42.080 --> 09:47.280
so you get seven chord sequence, and really the main difference is that we're going to add some

09:47.360 --> 09:53.520
extensions, so instead of just playing triads, which I've mainly done up till now, we're going to add

09:54.320 --> 10:03.200
a seventh, maybe a ninth.

10:17.840 --> 10:26.240
So straight away that sounds more harmonically rich, with these extended harmony notes,

10:26.240 --> 10:32.000
sevenths and the ninths, but it doesn't sound that jazzy, does it, because it's all still

10:32.000 --> 10:37.040
within the scale, and here's how we really make things sound more interesting.

10:38.480 --> 10:43.200
Let's start adding notes that are outside the scale of C minor.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.680
Got a flat nine on that F, the G flat,

10:55.600 --> 11:03.200
a flat nine on E flat, so the F flat, also known as an E.

11:17.920 --> 11:37.200
So now we've laid down all the groundwork, let's have some fun and think about some patterns and how

11:37.200 --> 11:44.480
we can use them in a jazz context. So if you watch my video on tritone substitution, you'll

11:44.480 --> 11:51.440
know how you can substitute any dominant seven chord you see, you can play a dominant seven chord

11:51.440 --> 11:57.600
that's a tritone away, so let's try using this principle and applying it to our cycle of fifths,

11:57.600 --> 12:03.840
well every dominant seven chord we see, we're going to play the dominant seven chord a tritone away,

12:04.480 --> 12:14.160
C minor seven, instead of F dominant seven, we'll play a B dominant seven,

12:17.200 --> 12:25.440
which resolves the same way as an F dominant seven would down to B flat major. Now we would have an

12:25.440 --> 12:32.160
E flat dominant seven, let's tritone substitute it, you'll get an A dominant seven,

12:34.880 --> 12:50.560
and basically you're going to get a chromatic moving bass line going down.

12:50.800 --> 13:00.960
So that's a very nice pattern you can play. So now we come to my final pattern that I'm going to

13:00.960 --> 13:07.040
talk about today, possibly my favorite of the patterns in the cycle of fifths, basically we're

13:07.040 --> 13:11.920
going to do a series of two fives, so the last chords in the two five one.

13:19.280 --> 13:32.160
So I do this a lot in my compositions, a lot of the chord progressions, I'll use this device.

13:37.280 --> 13:53.360
So start with a two five one in C would be D minor seven to G dominant seven.

13:54.240 --> 13:59.680
Now we're going to do another two five one, a half step down from C, so the two chord will be

13:59.680 --> 14:12.800
a C sharp minor seven, and the five chord will be an F sharp dominant seven, and we'll keep doing this pattern so

14:29.680 --> 14:34.240
okay.
