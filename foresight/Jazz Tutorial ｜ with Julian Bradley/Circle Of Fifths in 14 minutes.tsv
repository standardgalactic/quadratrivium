0	4480	So let's jump straight in. First of all, this is how a cycle of fifths sounds.
11600	17280	It's a very strong chord progression. It originates in classical music and basically every
18720	25760	anytime you resolve a chord down a fifth, that's a very strong resolution for a chord. So
27520	28640	it's always moving somewhere.
30560	47840	So first of all, there are two kinds of cycle of fifths. First of all, there's a perfect
48400	55200	cycle of fifths, which is where you go down a perfect fifth every time. And when you do that,
55600	62000	it will take you through all 12 notes on the keyboard. So if I start at C.
77680	82800	So it's a long progression. 12 chords is a long time. And for that reason,
82800	87920	the perfect cycle of fifths is hardly ever used in music. It's kind of a, it's interesting to
87920	93440	know about, but actually anytime you hear a cycle of fifths, it will usually be the other type of
93440	99920	cycle of fifths, which is called a diatonic cycle of fifths. First of all, the term diatonic
100480	106720	just means major or minor. So it refers to pieces of music that are in the major or minor scale.
107440	116960	And that's most of popular music, most of classical music up until the 20th century.
118320	124320	Most music was being written in major or minor scales. So for a diatonic cycle of fifths,
124320	130000	you go down a fifth each time, but you keep it within the scale that you're in. So if it's a major
130000	136320	scale or a minor scale, so in C minor, we'll start going down fifths within the scale. So
138400	140640	let's go down a fifth within the scale.
145120	145760	F minor.
151600	152480	B flat major.
153200	159760	E flat major. All perfect fifths so far.
165520	170640	So here we have an A flat major, and if we were to go down a perfect fifth,
171840	177680	we'd get D flat major, but that's not in the key of C minor. And to play a D flat major
178480	183760	would be a perfect cycle of fifths. But here we're talking about a diatonic cycle of fifths,
183760	188400	so we're going to keep it in the scale, count down five notes within the scale,
192640	201520	gives us a D diminished, and then count down a fifth from D, gives us another perfect fifth to G,
202080	209360	eventually resolving to C minor. So here's how the diatonic cycle of fifths sounds.
209360	234080	So in a diatonic cycle of fifths in classical music, the character of the chord, whether it's
234080	241120	major or minor, is dictated by the key, and all you do is count up in thirds to build a chord,
242400	247120	and whatever notes are in that scale will dictate whether it's a major or minor chord.
247120	256960	So in C minor, one chord is going to be a minor chord. Now if we go to F and build a chord within
257040	267040	the scale of C minor, we'll give us a flat three and a five, so it'll dictate that it's an F minor
267040	274320	chord. And now let's build a triad of the B flat. What kind of third do you have in the scale of
274320	284000	C minor? You'll have a natural D and a natural F, so you get a B flat major chord. Then an E flat,
284960	287600	building off D, what do we get?
290560	299040	B and F for the third, then up another third, we would have an A flat, so that's a D diminished triad,
301200	309120	and then the G, it would actually be a G minor chord, because C minor has a B flat,
309360	316480	but what's common in classical music and all music is to make that last chord just an exception
317280	324160	for a really strong resolution. We make it a G major, or if you're playing a seventh,
325520	332240	a G dominant seven, and that resolves down a fifth to the one chord.
400000	422240	But why is it so popular with composers? Well, a diatonic cycle of fifths is seven chords,
422240	427200	because it goes through each note of the scale, and there are seven notes in a scale.
429120	439920	So it's a great way of filling up some time, and usually in music we write eight bar phrases,
439920	444560	so what it means you can do is have one chord sustained for each bar, and that will give you a
444560	452880	seven bar chord progression, but then what's usual is to double the one chord, and they usually double
452880	460240	it, either playing it twice at the end, just to establish that one chord, or they start with the
460240	463200	one chord, and they end on the one chord, so...
482960	494640	So what's common with composers is they'll just come up with a melodic phrase that goes over two of the chords,
497520	503200	and then it's just great because then they can just transpose that same melodic phrase over
503200	513520	each chord progression, each two chord cell.
523920	530720	So a two five one, which is the most common chord progression in jazz, is actually just the final
530800	534800	three chords of a cycle of fifths, whether you're playing in the major scale,
538160	539520	or the minor scale,
544320	551200	and another chord progression you'll probably see a lot in jazz is not two five one, but six two five
551200	558160	one, and a six two five one is just the last four chords in a cycle of fifths, so six two five one
558160	567600	in C major would be A minor, D minor, G dominant seven, C major seven.
577280	582080	So a cycle of fifths in jazz will be the same, it will usually be a diatonic cycle of fifths,
582080	587280	so you get seven chord sequence, and really the main difference is that we're going to add some
587360	593520	extensions, so instead of just playing triads, which I've mainly done up till now, we're going to add
594320	603200	a seventh, maybe a ninth.
617840	626240	So straight away that sounds more harmonically rich, with these extended harmony notes,
626240	632000	sevenths and the ninths, but it doesn't sound that jazzy, does it, because it's all still
632000	637040	within the scale, and here's how we really make things sound more interesting.
638480	643200	Let's start adding notes that are outside the scale of C minor.
647280	649680	Got a flat nine on that F, the G flat,
655600	663200	a flat nine on E flat, so the F flat, also known as an E.
677920	697200	So now we've laid down all the groundwork, let's have some fun and think about some patterns and how
697200	704480	we can use them in a jazz context. So if you watch my video on tritone substitution, you'll
704480	711440	know how you can substitute any dominant seven chord you see, you can play a dominant seven chord
711440	717600	that's a tritone away, so let's try using this principle and applying it to our cycle of fifths,
717600	723840	well every dominant seven chord we see, we're going to play the dominant seven chord a tritone away,
724480	734160	C minor seven, instead of F dominant seven, we'll play a B dominant seven,
737200	745440	which resolves the same way as an F dominant seven would down to B flat major. Now we would have an
745440	752160	E flat dominant seven, let's tritone substitute it, you'll get an A dominant seven,
754880	770560	and basically you're going to get a chromatic moving bass line going down.
770800	780960	So that's a very nice pattern you can play. So now we come to my final pattern that I'm going to
780960	787040	talk about today, possibly my favorite of the patterns in the cycle of fifths, basically we're
787040	791920	going to do a series of two fives, so the last chords in the two five one.
799280	812160	So I do this a lot in my compositions, a lot of the chord progressions, I'll use this device.
817280	833360	So start with a two five one in C would be D minor seven to G dominant seven.
834240	839680	Now we're going to do another two five one, a half step down from C, so the two chord will be
839680	852800	a C sharp minor seven, and the five chord will be an F sharp dominant seven, and we'll keep doing this pattern so
869680	874240	okay.
