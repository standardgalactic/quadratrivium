00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
Salutations, listeners, and welcome back to Glitch Bottle, the podcast where we uncork

00:08.320 --> 00:12.240
the uncommon in magic, mysticism, and the generally misunderstood.

00:12.240 --> 00:17.240
I'm your host, Alexander F., and today, as usual, we are so excited and honored to talk

00:17.240 --> 00:24.180
about decrypting the Stegonographia with international author and scholar Dr. Steven

00:24.180 --> 00:25.180
Skinner.

00:25.180 --> 00:30.340
Now, listeners, I know you might be asking yourself, why is the Stegonographia the most

00:30.340 --> 00:36.780
notorious work of the German Benedictine, Abbott, and polymath, Johannes Tritemius?

00:36.780 --> 00:39.140
It was written in the year 1500.

00:39.140 --> 00:44.220
Is the Stegonographia a text about the evocation of spirits?

00:44.220 --> 00:50.780
Is it a system of cryptography where information is secretly encoded or both?

00:51.340 --> 00:56.940
Internationally acclaimed author, practicing magician, and scholar Dr. Steven Skinner

00:56.940 --> 01:01.020
is the perfect person to ask as he returns on the podcast.

01:01.020 --> 01:07.380
Dr. Skinner has again collaborated with Daniel Clark in an upcoming publication where all

01:07.380 --> 01:13.900
four books of the Stegonographia are being published in English for the first time with

01:13.900 --> 01:17.220
extensive explanations and commentary.

01:17.220 --> 01:22.540
It sounds like it is just going to be so vital and so excellent as usual.

01:22.540 --> 01:28.100
This upcoming edition of the Stegonographia contains the remaining parts of books one

01:28.100 --> 01:34.500
and three with detailed spirit registers covering 32 spirits, but it also features a full translation

01:34.500 --> 01:41.580
of book two, which contains another 25 spirits and book four, which relates the Stegonographia

01:41.580 --> 01:47.780
to Paracelsus, the Almadel, and the Shemham Farrash of Solomon, Adam, and Moses.

01:47.780 --> 01:54.100
So this looks to be absolutely an excellent collection and a scholarly and important restoration

01:54.100 --> 01:59.020
of the grimoire tradition of the magical tradition broadly speaking.

01:59.020 --> 02:04.380
And with all that being said, Dr. Steven Skinner, thank you so, so much for taking the time

02:04.380 --> 02:08.420
and stopping back on the Glitch Bottle podcast today.

02:08.420 --> 02:12.380
It's always my pleasure and I do enjoy talking to you.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.500
And you just summed it up perfectly.

02:14.500 --> 02:18.340
I don't really need to say anything more too high.

02:18.340 --> 02:20.340
Well, yes, sir.

02:20.340 --> 02:27.260
But I will, because you can't shut me up anyway, nor would I ever want to.

02:27.260 --> 02:30.220
I was going to say no comment, please.

02:30.220 --> 02:38.140
So I could just mention, first of all, what does Stegonographia mean when it comes as

02:38.380 --> 02:47.660
Alex has said it is sometimes seen as a cryptography manual and sometimes seen as a magic manual.

02:47.660 --> 02:52.660
So I have to admit upfront, I know a bit about cryptography, but I'm not a cryptographic

02:52.660 --> 02:54.660
expert.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.340
But I do know a little bit about magic.

02:56.340 --> 03:01.540
So the focus of this book is primarily in the magical direction rather than the cryptographic

03:01.540 --> 03:02.540
direction.

03:02.540 --> 03:04.500
But I'll explain all later.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.380
So what does the word Stegonographia mean?

03:07.700 --> 03:10.620
Well, it's made up of two Greek words.

03:10.620 --> 03:19.260
And the usual translation is that it's secret writing, Stegopo secret and Graphia writing.

03:19.260 --> 03:27.380
But if you look at the Greek properly, Stegano actually means watertight and Graphia is writing.

03:27.380 --> 03:31.260
So it's actually a book of watertight writing.

03:31.260 --> 03:36.100
And we may come to that a little bit later.

03:36.180 --> 03:41.420
At least people now have heard of it and they stopped saying, is it a book of shorthand

03:41.420 --> 03:44.420
or stenography?

03:44.420 --> 03:48.620
In fact, I've had arguments with people about the spelling of it.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.660
Oh, it should be Stegonographia, shouldn't it?

03:50.660 --> 03:53.620
No, it's Stegonographia.

03:53.620 --> 03:57.180
Okay, so who wrote it?

03:57.180 --> 04:00.140
Well, the Abbott Trasimius.

04:00.140 --> 04:07.060
Now, this is an amazing thing that an Abbott, well-known in Germany, actually wrote books

04:07.060 --> 04:17.460
on magic and the Inquisition didn't turn up on his doorstep or drag him off in chains

04:17.460 --> 04:24.620
because he had powerful friends like Maximilian, the Emperor Maximilian, etc.

04:24.620 --> 04:31.580
But you had to do a little bit more than just have powerful friends to avoid the Inquisition

04:31.580 --> 04:33.900
and their pals.

04:33.900 --> 04:41.540
So the question is, was it a book on stenography with a bit of magic thrown in or a book on

04:41.540 --> 04:44.060
magic with a bit of stenography thrown in?

04:44.060 --> 04:51.660
And you have to ask yourself, if you were an Abbott in the year 1500 in Germany, which

04:51.660 --> 04:55.660
of those two things would be the most inflammatory?

04:55.660 --> 05:01.220
And the answer is, you're more likely to be done for magic than to be done for writing

05:01.220 --> 05:03.380
secret messages.

05:03.380 --> 05:11.420
So my conclusion from a long time is that it's a book on magic with cryptography thrown

05:11.420 --> 05:17.660
in so that Trasimius had deniability.

05:17.660 --> 05:23.220
If he was ever grabbed by the Inquisition, he could say, no, it's a book on secret writing.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.220
Can't you see that?

05:24.220 --> 05:27.260
Are you stupid or something?

05:27.260 --> 05:31.500
And it's not, it's a book on magic.

05:31.500 --> 05:40.140
And in it, there are, what was it, 57 spirits with full details, 25 plus 31, I think.

05:40.140 --> 05:46.500
So that's 56 spirits.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.060
And it's practical.

05:49.060 --> 05:54.420
Now, how did Trasimius get into trouble with it?

05:54.420 --> 06:04.660
Well, he sent a copy of it to his friend who was in Ghent and who was a Carmelite monk.

06:04.660 --> 06:08.900
And he knew this guy was okay talking about magic.

06:08.900 --> 06:17.820
And when he sent it, because the mail was not perhaps as fast as it is today, his friend

06:17.820 --> 06:23.660
in the Carmelite monk had actually died.

06:23.660 --> 06:28.940
So when it arrived, the head of the monastery there opened it, looked at the book and was

06:28.940 --> 06:36.100
completely shocked because what is one of the church senior members, an abbot was a

06:36.100 --> 06:40.980
fairly senior title, were doing writing a book on magic.

06:40.980 --> 06:49.020
And that unfortunately for Trasimius is where his reputation as a magician began.

06:49.020 --> 06:56.660
And he spent the rest of his life fairly cleverly sending it off and explaining what it really

06:56.660 --> 06:57.660
was.

06:57.660 --> 07:06.080
Anyway, so Trasimius was an abbot, a historian, a magician.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.560
And a monk.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.160
And how did that happen?

07:09.160 --> 07:13.600
Well, I'm sure everybody said this story, but I'm just going to tell it because I like

07:13.600 --> 07:15.480
this story.

07:15.480 --> 07:23.440
He was coming back from having visited his family in Trittenheim and he was stopped by

07:23.440 --> 07:25.040
a snowstorm.

07:25.040 --> 07:32.720
So he pulled in, as it were, if he'd been driving, it would have been, to the local monastery

07:32.720 --> 07:36.600
which put him up for the night.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.120
The next morning he set out again, where the looked okay.

07:40.120 --> 07:44.560
He didn't go very far and then a huge snowstorm came again.

07:44.560 --> 07:52.280
And so he was forced to go back and plead, do you mind if I stay the night again here?

07:52.280 --> 07:56.520
And I think he probably privately thought that it was the hand of God telling him this

07:56.520 --> 07:58.720
is where he was supposed to be.

07:58.720 --> 08:04.800
So instead of moving on on the third morning, he decided to join the monastery as an ordinary

08:04.800 --> 08:05.800
monk.

08:05.800 --> 08:15.440
He was in his late teens, but being an incredibly intelligent man who read and spoke a number

08:15.440 --> 08:23.320
of languages, definitely Latin, definitely German, probably a dash of Hebrew, et cetera,

08:23.320 --> 08:26.640
and some Greek.

08:26.640 --> 08:31.560
The monks realized what a powerhouse intellect he was.

08:31.560 --> 08:37.480
And when he was 22, maybe 23, they elected him as the abbot of the monastery.

08:37.480 --> 08:45.000
And from then on it was up and up until the point where he sent his, unfortunately, deceased

08:45.000 --> 08:48.160
friend, a copy of the Stegonographia.

08:48.160 --> 08:54.840
One minor thing that people probably never mention is that his original name was Heidenberg

08:55.840 --> 09:02.840
which literally translates from German as from the pagan mountain, which I think is

09:02.840 --> 09:06.280
a lovely way of looking at his name.

09:06.280 --> 09:11.680
But he took Trusenius to celebrate the fact that he was born in Trittenheim.

09:11.680 --> 09:16.480
So it was a man from Trittenheim who became his name.

09:16.480 --> 09:22.320
He was also the teacher of a gripper and to a lesser extent of Paracelsus.

09:22.320 --> 09:31.480
But the gripper utilized his huge library of magical books to learn about magic and

09:31.480 --> 09:33.760
then finally to write about it.

09:33.760 --> 09:37.960
And I think nobody's going to argue if I said that a gripper's three books of occult

09:37.960 --> 09:47.760
philosophy is probably the main text of Western magic.

09:47.760 --> 09:54.760
So you could see Trusenius as being, if not the fountain head, at least a fountain head

09:54.760 --> 10:01.320
of European magic and the actual fountain head was his library, but I'll talk about

10:01.320 --> 10:03.360
his library a little bit later.

10:03.360 --> 10:10.000
So Dr. Skinner, given all of that historical background with Trusenius, can you share about

10:10.000 --> 10:17.680
what differences did you find between the printed Latin text and the manuscript that

10:17.680 --> 10:19.200
you worked from?

10:19.200 --> 10:21.040
Right.

10:21.040 --> 10:27.080
So when I started this project, I was looking around and I saw that Adam McClain had actually

10:27.080 --> 10:35.400
made a decent English translation, but he only translated volume one and volume three,

10:35.400 --> 10:40.440
leaving volume two and volume four untranslated.

10:40.440 --> 10:47.200
If anybody wonders whether there really was a volume four, then you just look at Culliana's

10:47.240 --> 10:53.200
book, Eros and Magic in the Renaissance, where he confirms that there were actually

10:53.200 --> 10:55.160
four books originally.

10:55.160 --> 10:59.440
Anyway, so I was lucky.

10:59.440 --> 11:07.200
In fact, it was Daniel Clarke, my co-author, who was lucky because he uncovered a manuscript

11:07.200 --> 11:14.320
of the Stegonographia, which was not as old as the German manuscripts, but much more detailed.

11:14.320 --> 11:22.720
So it was obviously translated at the point before people started losing or destroying

11:22.720 --> 11:24.880
manuscripts.

11:24.880 --> 11:30.320
And so as you can see on this picture, the illustrations were a bit sketchy.

11:30.320 --> 11:34.280
This one just shows a few of the directions.

11:34.280 --> 11:38.840
And people mostly thought, well, it was just an example of some directions, but no.

11:38.880 --> 11:46.600
In the original manuscript by Josemius, which we don't have to hand, he showed all the directions.

11:46.600 --> 11:55.080
So in the manuscript I worked on with Daniel, you can see much, much more detail.

11:55.080 --> 12:03.680
So realizing that this manuscript that Daniel dug up had two more volumes and a lot more

12:03.720 --> 12:08.680
detail and illustrations, which were much more complete.

12:08.680 --> 12:11.960
I thought we got to translate it.

12:11.960 --> 12:15.320
So and that was a mistake.

12:15.320 --> 12:20.720
I mean, if I'd realized how much work had to go into this, I would not have made that

12:20.720 --> 12:21.720
decision.

12:21.720 --> 12:27.720
But anyway, I did make the decision and we went for it.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.160
Well, that that is so lovely, Dr. Skinner.

12:30.160 --> 12:37.760
And I think it actually follows a really interesting point that you made sharing many years ago

12:37.760 --> 12:40.440
that when you first came across text.

12:40.440 --> 12:45.400
So for instance, I remember a story and I forgive me, I'm going to butcher some of the facts,

12:45.400 --> 12:51.000
but you were very young and you went to the local bookstore and you were trying to, I

12:51.000 --> 12:53.760
believe it was the LeMegatins' Goat Asia or Crowley's.

12:54.520 --> 12:55.920
It was. Yes.

12:56.480 --> 13:01.080
And I love that when you would you win in and said, I would like to I have an order for this.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.120
And the person up front said, oh, no, no, he's much too young.

13:04.120 --> 13:09.600
And then finally, I think it was the manager that came front forward and said, oh, Steven,

13:09.600 --> 13:10.680
he's he's fine.

13:10.680 --> 13:11.400
It's OK.

13:11.400 --> 13:16.720
You know, and I thought, what a what a powerful story about, especially at the time, you know,

13:16.720 --> 13:18.640
discovering a text for the first time.

13:18.760 --> 13:24.080
So to that point, Dr. Skinner, can you share with us when did you first come across this

13:24.120 --> 13:26.720
specific text, the Stegonographia?

13:27.320 --> 13:34.160
OK, but just to add a little bit to the anecdote you told there, the bookshop manager, it was

13:34.160 --> 13:39.880
the Adiar Bookshop in Sydney and the manager was Cecil Novi, who has very sadly passed away

13:39.880 --> 13:46.400
very recently, but she was a lovely lady and she was aware of the fact that it was fairly

13:46.400 --> 13:48.680
safe to leave the Goatia in my hands.

13:48.680 --> 13:53.360
And thank God she did because an awful lot of work came out of that.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.640
Anyway, when did I first come across it?

13:56.640 --> 13:58.680
Well, I'd been interested in Dr.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.440
John Dee from way back.

14:03.040 --> 14:08.200
And we're talking 13, 14, we're talking pretty precocious.

14:10.120 --> 14:20.120
And in it, the reading about Dee, I heard that Dee had once copied by hand the whole

14:20.120 --> 14:27.760
of the Stegonographia, sitting somewhere in, I guess, Germany, working from a Latin manuscript.

14:28.560 --> 14:34.240
And I thought, well, if Dee thought it was that valuable, that it was worth the considerable

14:34.240 --> 14:35.640
effort of copying by hand.

14:36.160 --> 14:40.360
And here you can actually see a copy of that copy.

14:40.760 --> 14:46.680
You can see that Dee had done a lot of work and his his illustration there is much more

14:46.680 --> 14:49.120
complete than the printed one.

14:49.760 --> 14:57.880
So I figured that the printed copies, even in German, were not as complete as some of

14:57.880 --> 14:59.040
the manuscript copies.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.040
So that was my first desire.

15:02.120 --> 15:02.720
Wow.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.640
If Dee thought it was good, it's got to be good.

15:06.360 --> 15:13.000
And then Adam McClain, who is a guy who's very famous for his knowledge of alchemy,

15:13.960 --> 15:19.720
arranged a partial translation of Volume 1 and 3 in 1982.

15:21.280 --> 15:26.920
And by comparing it with the Latin, I realized that books two and four were missing.

15:28.040 --> 15:34.080
So that gave me more reason still to produce a complete copy.

15:34.760 --> 15:39.400
I decided to translate all four books into English, again, a foolish decision.

15:40.160 --> 15:45.720
When I was convinced that there actually were four books and not just that three that

15:45.720 --> 15:46.800
people had mentioned.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.480
Ah, there you go.

15:50.640 --> 15:54.200
Well, I believe and I try not to speak for the listeners, Dr.

15:54.200 --> 15:58.160
Skinner, but your foolishness and the foolishness of Daniel Clark and everyone else has

15:58.160 --> 16:03.200
certainly been to the to the boon of pushing the boundaries of understanding of the

16:03.200 --> 16:04.080
Grimoire tradition.

16:04.080 --> 16:07.920
So I must say, it certainly is a wonderful thing.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.840
And speaking of Daniel Clark, actually, Dr.

16:11.840 --> 16:18.120
Skinner, can you tell us this is several times now you have collaborated with Daniel

16:18.120 --> 16:18.480
Clark.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.600
How did how did this process work?

16:20.600 --> 16:23.560
You know, you have two great minds tackling this text.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.360
Can you tell us about that relationship?

16:26.640 --> 16:29.520
Well, I have to admit, I've never met Daniel.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.080
It's all been online communication.

16:32.080 --> 16:37.720
But the communication has been very good because Daniel has got an amazing

16:37.760 --> 16:38.200
brain.

16:39.480 --> 16:46.560
He's located down in Tasmania, and I was originally located in Malaysia and then

16:46.560 --> 16:49.000
Singapore and now London.

16:50.680 --> 16:56.200
But Daniel has his hand on where all of these manuscripts come from.

16:57.480 --> 17:03.320
More than anybody else, I know he has an insight into which collections have got

17:03.320 --> 17:08.440
which manuscripts and how to get copies of it and has a huge digital

17:08.440 --> 17:09.120
collection.

17:09.840 --> 17:15.440
And he was very generous from day one in lending them to me if I wanted to work

17:15.440 --> 17:19.880
on them and finally I decided, well, let us work together.

17:20.480 --> 17:26.000
He's a delightfully clearheaded guy and he doesn't take any kind of bullshit.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.960
He's just does what he needs to do.

17:29.960 --> 17:36.040
So we worked on it together and Daniel's many skills included dealing with these

17:36.040 --> 17:45.400
libraries who hold their own manuscripts, but also research and repairing, digitally

17:45.400 --> 17:49.600
repairing the manuscripts so that you go from something which looks appalling to

17:49.600 --> 17:51.840
something which is actually very clear.

17:52.240 --> 17:58.480
And if you can see here one that of the same picture that Daniel has restored,

17:59.480 --> 18:05.360
so we've used his restorations in the book, it's so much better than trying to

18:05.360 --> 18:06.560
look at the original.

18:06.560 --> 18:11.240
We don't redraw them, no, we just take the original and clean it.

18:11.640 --> 18:18.680
As well, Dr. Skinner, something you touched on at the beginning of our chat is that as

18:18.680 --> 18:23.760
Joseph H. Peterson says, quote, the Stegonographia is Trithemis' most notorious

18:23.760 --> 18:29.240
work. In private circulation, the Stegonographia brought such a reaction

18:29.240 --> 18:34.400
of fear that he, Trithemis, decided it should never be published, end quote.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.520
So Dr. Skinner, can you share with the listeners who might be hearing

18:37.520 --> 18:38.920
about this for the first time?

18:39.120 --> 18:43.320
Why was this work so notorious, if you will?

18:44.440 --> 18:49.960
Well, I suppose the first push at being notorious was the

18:50.760 --> 18:56.400
the Carmelite head of the monastery opening somebody else's mail and reading it

18:56.400 --> 19:01.720
with horror, because he didn't just then put it on one side, but he sent copies

19:01.720 --> 19:03.920
around and told other people about it.

19:04.800 --> 19:12.160
Not very reasonable of him, but so that started off and people then sort of took

19:12.160 --> 19:18.760
up, oh, this arbiter is doing magic, he's invoking spirits because here are all

19:18.760 --> 19:20.880
the details in this book, blah, blah, blah.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.600
And Trithemis then had a bit of a job tamping this down.

19:26.280 --> 19:32.400
But the bottom line is that in dealing with spirits in this way was not natural

19:32.400 --> 19:39.680
magic. And in those days, scholars, monks, et cetera, use the word natural

19:39.680 --> 19:41.280
magic as defense.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.560
So the church could go, hey, what are you doing?

19:45.560 --> 19:48.120
And they say, no, we're just doing natural magic.

19:48.560 --> 19:54.280
Herbs and stones and the 15 different varieties of correspondences, which

19:54.880 --> 19:57.400
everybody knew about in those days, but they don't know.

19:59.720 --> 20:07.200
And nothing about dealing with spirits in standing in a circle and stuff like that.

20:08.080 --> 20:13.000
But of course, that is not the sort of magic that's in the Stegonographio.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.040
It is spirit-based, evocatory magic.

20:18.440 --> 20:26.880
They go and Trithemis destroyed or suppressed the more extreme parts to

20:26.880 --> 20:28.200
save his reputation.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.960
But fortunately, some of the translations, including the one we work from,

20:32.920 --> 20:35.240
escaped without being too heavily cut.

20:35.960 --> 20:40.600
There is always a possibility that we haven't got the most complete

20:40.600 --> 20:44.320
manuscript in existence, but I can be very sure that it's...

20:47.040 --> 20:51.680
I can't think of a percentage, but it's twice as complete as any of the other

20:51.680 --> 20:55.200
manuscripts wandering around or even the printed version, because the printed

20:55.200 --> 20:58.760
version was from an early Latin version.

20:59.080 --> 21:04.760
One of the first times, Dr. Skinner, that I heard about this debate with

21:04.760 --> 21:07.560
the Stegonographio, is it cryptography?

21:07.640 --> 21:08.680
Is it sorcery?

21:08.840 --> 21:12.520
Was actually, and I'll reach in my bookshelf here, one of my favorite tomes,

21:12.520 --> 21:16.920
the Goetia of Dr. Rudd, the third volume in the Sourceworks of Ceremonial

21:16.920 --> 21:20.800
Magic series, where you and David Rankin explore this issue and you touched

21:20.800 --> 21:23.600
on it just a few moments ago, Dr. Skinner.

21:23.600 --> 21:29.280
So I'll just ask, you mentioned that the Stegonographio is a book about magic,

21:30.040 --> 21:36.040
not cryptography, but what is the relationship between encoding messages

21:36.160 --> 21:38.560
and then the sending of those messages to spirits?

21:38.560 --> 21:40.480
Can you just give us kind of the full picture?

21:41.400 --> 21:46.520
Okay, so this is quite a subtle point, so it takes a bit of explaining.

21:47.240 --> 21:53.320
So first of all, what is the relationship between evoking a spirit and using cryptography?

21:54.400 --> 22:00.400
And there is a relationship, so that some grimoires suggest that the

22:01.400 --> 22:06.360
evocation should be encrypted, or the name of the spirit should be encrypted, etc.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.360
And that always sounded a bit weird to me.

22:10.000 --> 22:15.640
But then if you think about what Aston Aston and Spare was doing, he was taking

22:16.160 --> 22:22.360
the magical result that he desired written in English, and then he was

22:23.680 --> 22:29.200
using cryptography or his own version of cryptography to produce something

22:29.200 --> 22:32.880
which doesn't mean anything, a series of letters and things.

22:33.600 --> 22:41.800
So he was also using cryptography before calling for the spirit.

22:42.720 --> 22:48.520
And one of the things there is, of course, you ask the question, what languages

22:48.520 --> 22:49.760
do spirits speak?

22:49.880 --> 22:55.880
And in the Middle Ages, they would have been assumed to speak Latin and possibly Greek,

22:56.880 --> 23:02.560
which was good because everybody in those days spoke Latin, not the case anymore.

23:04.360 --> 23:13.400
And therefore, what you needed was to focus on the outcome that you're looking for,

23:13.400 --> 23:14.760
or the name of the spirit.

23:15.800 --> 23:21.440
And one of the practices is you could encrypt it, because when you encrypt

23:21.440 --> 23:24.280
something, you have to think about it a lot.

23:25.280 --> 23:34.360
And so this, as it were, underlined the desired results, and it got through to the spirit.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.960
Whereas if you just stand in the middle of the room and quickly read off something you

23:38.960 --> 23:42.880
wrote 10 minutes ago, this doesn't have the same impact.

23:42.960 --> 23:47.280
So it's increasing the impact by encrypting.

23:47.720 --> 23:53.160
Now, sending messages via spirits is a different thing.

23:53.560 --> 23:57.720
But you can still use cryptography to stress it.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.600
So let's stand back from there.

24:02.280 --> 24:10.920
What Christos Emius was aiming at was the 1500s version of email.

24:12.000 --> 24:19.440
He wanted to be able to send messages to monks who knew about magic in other monasteries

24:19.440 --> 24:24.200
on the other side of Germany or Czechoslovakia or in Italy or whatever.

24:25.720 --> 24:32.080
He didn't very sadly have email, but he figured, and it is true, that he could use

24:32.120 --> 24:33.840
spirits to take the message.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.880
So you give the message to a spirit.

24:36.120 --> 24:38.320
You first of all, you've got to call the spirit properly.

24:39.080 --> 24:45.240
Give the message, the spirit, and tell the spirit to deliver it to Mr.

24:46.200 --> 24:50.400
Orwellis in Prague or something.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.120
And the spirit will do that.

24:54.280 --> 25:00.640
But the problem with the message is when he gets there, the recipient will not either

25:00.640 --> 25:05.240
understand the message or understand that something has been sent to him.

25:05.880 --> 25:10.360
So it had to be with somebody who also understood the magic, who knew what the

25:10.360 --> 25:16.440
invocation was to material, not materialize, but to consolidate the spirit and to

25:16.440 --> 25:17.240
get the message.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.120
So it's kind of a complicated procedure, just like with email.

25:21.120 --> 25:27.880
You need machinery at one end to encrypt the message into electrical pulses.

25:27.880 --> 25:32.960
And then you need machinery at the other end to unencrypted, as it were, into a piece

25:32.960 --> 25:35.000
of sensible English.

25:35.680 --> 25:39.320
Dr. Skinner, where have you practiced this?

25:39.360 --> 25:42.040
Have you engaged with the steganographia?

25:42.560 --> 25:44.160
Yes, I have experimented.

25:44.160 --> 25:50.280
And I have to say that unless the recipient is well trained, well versed in the

25:50.280 --> 25:51.880
method, it's quite difficult.

25:52.960 --> 26:00.240
And so I found that sometimes I can simply send the message so that the person dreams

26:00.240 --> 26:04.160
about it rather than the spirit actually explaining it.

26:04.960 --> 26:08.440
But then I thought, well, I don't look going to waste much more time on this

26:08.480 --> 26:13.000
because email is much, much more efficient and much, much more accurate.

26:13.720 --> 26:20.240
But there's a 500 year gap between one method and the other.

26:21.040 --> 26:27.480
So although the objective of a lot of the steganographia is to send spirit

26:27.760 --> 26:32.920
carried messages, there is other stuff in there that's of use to people who are

26:32.920 --> 26:34.040
interested in magic.

26:34.480 --> 26:39.960
Dr. Skinner, as well, something that ties into what you just shared is people

26:39.960 --> 26:44.800
have been wondering for centuries if the steganographia is a book about encoding

26:44.800 --> 26:46.280
messages or summoning spirits.

26:46.280 --> 26:49.200
You just added a bunch of excellent context there.

26:49.480 --> 26:54.240
And to that point, we have a few listener questions for you from Glitchbottle

26:54.240 --> 26:56.560
patron Anna Maddalena.

26:56.600 --> 27:03.440
And Anna is asking her first question is, I'm very eager to know what details you

27:03.440 --> 27:06.800
have culled from the steganographia, Dr. Skinner.

27:08.240 --> 27:14.800
Well, one of the details that I found most interesting is that the steganographia

27:14.800 --> 27:20.320
has across two of its books, two complete spirit registers.

27:21.240 --> 27:26.720
Now, a spirit register will be familiar to anybody who's read the Goetia.

27:27.360 --> 27:31.920
It's a list of spirits with details about what their offices are.

27:31.960 --> 27:37.760
In other words, what it is they're capable of doing and sometimes their schedule.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.680
So that was the first thing.

27:42.200 --> 27:49.240
But in the steganographia, every spirit has its own private invocation, which is

27:49.240 --> 27:54.880
very rare, probably completely unique, because the usual procedure is you have

27:54.880 --> 27:58.640
a standard evocation into which you insert the spirit's name.

27:59.640 --> 28:06.000
But this is somewhat more powerful because you are using an evocation in a

28:06.000 --> 28:13.520
language which I'm not going to specify, but one not very commonly known to call

28:13.680 --> 28:19.400
that spirit and that spirit should get the message a lot easier.

28:20.480 --> 28:27.000
Talking about that, somebody once asked me, what senses do spirits have?

28:28.000 --> 28:34.880
Well, I can tell you that they can hear even at, well, is it a remarkable

28:34.880 --> 28:40.000
distance or are they in fact very close, but in another dimension, but they can

28:40.000 --> 28:45.440
certainly hear and the spirit will recognize its own name, even if you

28:45.440 --> 28:46.800
mispronounce it a little bit.

28:47.800 --> 28:52.920
The other thing they can do is they can smell because the choice of

28:52.960 --> 28:55.400
incenses is critical for magic.

28:56.840 --> 29:02.000
You have different incenses for different planetary spirits, for example.

29:03.520 --> 29:09.480
And spirits actually are attracted by beautiful smelling atmosphere.

29:11.480 --> 29:17.280
So when you say that the spirit is invoked, you can make things convenient

29:17.280 --> 29:22.680
for him by burning or vaporizing a smell that he likes.

29:22.680 --> 29:27.400
So I can say that spirits have a sense of hearing, a sense of smell.

29:28.320 --> 29:35.800
I can also say that their sight is not that clear because I've done certain

29:35.800 --> 29:40.040
experiments and I'll just leave it at that, that they're not very clear with

29:40.040 --> 29:44.560
sight, maybe it's the difference of working across two different worlds.

29:45.520 --> 29:52.720
But given those two things, the sense of smell is the hint why

29:55.640 --> 30:02.320
magicians have to bath or clear themselves immediately before an

30:02.320 --> 30:06.880
operation because they do not like the smell of human beings.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.680
And so in fact, some magicians recommended that you actually

30:12.760 --> 30:19.440
study yourself with some sweet smelling incense or whatever and that works quite well.

30:19.720 --> 30:23.000
Dr. Skinner as well, this just popped into my head.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.400
So let me just let me just ask you between Anna's questions.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.960
But in another one of your tomes, I feel like I'm pulling every book off

30:29.960 --> 30:34.400
of my bookshelf here and the nine Rudian provocations.

30:34.400 --> 30:38.920
The Solomonic Archangels and Demon Princes, one of the pieces of advice

30:39.400 --> 30:42.440
that is given is to never.

30:42.640 --> 30:46.600
It's one of the beneficial aphorisms says never mix experiments.

30:46.600 --> 30:51.480
So you either focus on more celestial operations or more sublunar,

30:51.480 --> 30:55.360
if you will, slash catholic operations for these spirits.

30:56.080 --> 31:01.720
Would you classify the spirits and the Stegonographia as angelic or in the

31:01.720 --> 31:06.280
Theurgia, Goetia, they seem to be these aerial spirits, these dukes that can wander.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.240
Can you share a little bit about that?

31:08.720 --> 31:12.960
They're actually sublunar spirits or aerial spirits.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.560
So they can float around in the atmosphere.

31:17.880 --> 31:22.320
If you get them to materialize, then they will be just floating around

31:22.320 --> 31:24.880
rather than standing on the floor or anything like that.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.800
Subluna is a nice word, anything under the moon,

31:29.600 --> 31:34.120
but it excludes sonic or subterranean spirits,

31:34.160 --> 31:37.160
which are a completely different sort of animal.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.360
Excellent. Thank you, Dr. Skinner.

31:40.360 --> 31:43.920
I know myself and I'm sure the listeners really appreciate that.

31:44.840 --> 31:47.640
Back to Anna's question and his next question.

31:47.920 --> 31:52.040
We broke these up a little bit and is asking and commenting, Dr.

31:52.040 --> 31:56.640
Skinner, that it always struck me as strange that important state secrets

31:56.640 --> 31:59.520
would be encoded by lists of spirit names.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.640
Can you comment on this a little bit?

32:02.640 --> 32:06.560
Yeah, the messages are not encoded by the spirit names.

32:06.560 --> 32:11.960
The spirit names are actually labels for particular encoding messages.

32:11.960 --> 32:16.400
So if it was, say, parmesiel,

32:17.360 --> 32:22.200
this is a particular encoding procedure.

32:22.480 --> 32:26.360
So then they're labels and you could have used animal names.

32:26.360 --> 32:30.920
It could have been the giraffe encoding and the rhinoceros encoding.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.120
But Trasimus has used spirit names,

32:34.760 --> 32:39.640
which is confused a lot of people because they are trying to see some connection

32:39.640 --> 32:45.080
between the encoding and the magic, which I've vaguely explained already.

32:45.520 --> 32:50.240
To Anna's next question, Anna is asking, in particular, Dr. Skinner,

32:50.240 --> 32:54.280
I'm wondering if you agree that the occult aspect of the text

32:54.280 --> 32:57.400
is merely a blind for the deeper cryptographic work

32:57.400 --> 33:03.120
or if it has a double valency as both a code book and an esoteric tone?

33:04.440 --> 33:11.240
Well, it does have a double valency and Trasimus must have been a fantastically

33:11.240 --> 33:15.960
bright guy because he's managed to work both things into the text.

33:16.760 --> 33:21.160
But the cryptography gives him deniability.

33:22.120 --> 33:26.440
If he's brought up before a body of his peers or the inquisition,

33:26.440 --> 33:30.840
he can say, no, you stupid people, you can see it's about cryptography.

33:31.320 --> 33:35.000
And I've just used magic to frighten people away from it

33:36.440 --> 33:39.320
because he knows he can't be done for cryptography.

33:39.320 --> 33:40.200
It's not a crime.

33:41.160 --> 33:47.080
However, evoking spirits might very well be a theological crime.

33:48.040 --> 33:53.560
So when he's got that deniability, it's achieved itself.

33:53.560 --> 33:59.880
But his cryptography is also there and it's not the most efficient cryptography.

33:59.880 --> 34:05.320
So you might need 100 words to just make a very short message.

34:06.520 --> 34:11.240
And there are much better ways of making short messages cryptographically

34:11.240 --> 34:13.080
rather than wasting so many words.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.480
But what do I know about cryptography?

34:19.720 --> 34:21.080
Quite a lot, quite a lot.

34:21.080 --> 34:26.520
And so it seems, Dr. Skinner, that Anna's saying exactly what you just commented on,

34:26.520 --> 34:31.800
which is in some places in Europe, possessing such a book of necromantic names,

34:31.800 --> 34:35.640
those demonic names could get you in as much trouble or more trouble

34:35.640 --> 34:38.760
as passing along state secrets, it seems.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.680
Yeah, absolutely.

34:40.680 --> 34:48.920
I mean, state secrets, well, for example, D was an intelligence for Elizabeth I.

34:49.880 --> 34:54.360
But I'm sure a lot of the stuff that he was sending back to England

34:54.360 --> 34:55.640
wouldn't have got him into trouble.

34:56.440 --> 35:04.760
But having been convicted of evoking evil spirits from the church's point of view,

35:04.760 --> 35:07.320
that would have definitely got him into trouble.

35:07.320 --> 35:13.640
So the necromantic names are much more dangerous than passing on secret information.

35:14.200 --> 35:19.080
One of your primary areas of focus, Dr. Skinner, and it's even in the name of one of your books,

35:19.080 --> 35:23.400
is the techniques, the technological application.

35:23.400 --> 35:29.000
And you mentioned, along with David Rankin in the Goetia of Dr. Rudd, a wonderful tome,

35:29.000 --> 35:37.400
that, quote, the same tables used to encrypt also produced the spirit names, end quote.

35:37.400 --> 35:42.040
So roughly, Dr. Skinner, can you share with listeners who might be hearing about this

35:42.040 --> 35:43.320
for the first time?

35:43.320 --> 35:45.480
How does this whole process work?

35:45.560 --> 35:50.840
Is the practitioner supposed to derive the spirit names first and then encrypt

35:50.840 --> 35:52.280
a message for the spirit?

35:52.280 --> 35:53.400
How does all that work?

35:54.360 --> 35:56.280
No, it's two separate processes.

35:56.280 --> 36:01.080
So you can generate spirit names by using tables of Hebrew letters,

36:03.320 --> 36:10.360
using a sigil to tell you which cell in the table you go to from which cell and on to which cell

36:11.160 --> 36:19.240
you spell out a name, or even the reverse process, you spell the name onto the table

36:19.240 --> 36:20.920
and that gives you the spirit sigil.

36:21.800 --> 36:26.040
Because the ingredients that you need for an evocation are the name of the spirit,

36:26.840 --> 36:33.000
the sigil of the spirit, and then you need to calculate what's the best time to call them,

36:34.680 --> 36:35.880
et cetera, et cetera.

36:36.520 --> 36:41.960
That's using tables to produce the name of spirits or to check the sigil or to reverse

36:41.960 --> 36:47.960
that, but it's not the whole process.

36:48.920 --> 36:52.680
Encrypting the message for the spirit is a separate process.

36:52.680 --> 36:58.600
So you know the spirit name, you call the spirit, you tell the spirit your message in

36:58.600 --> 37:04.920
whatever form, whatever language, whatever cryptographic form, and then he will convey

37:04.920 --> 37:14.280
that more or less accurately, and I can't swear always accurately, to the distant friend or

37:15.560 --> 37:21.960
who is similarly aware of this magical technique, and then he will say the necessary words,

37:22.680 --> 37:26.840
and more often than not, the message will come to him and dream.

37:27.240 --> 37:35.800
The trisimus says the spirit will whisper it in his ear, but my experience is that

37:35.800 --> 37:37.080
doesn't always happen.

37:37.080 --> 37:41.560
It's more likely to turn up in the dream on the following night.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.760
Reminds me, Dr. Skinner, of something you touched on before.

37:45.640 --> 37:52.200
There's a, I believe in the PGM, there's a spell that says that you can have a message

37:52.200 --> 37:59.320
and the deity will appear in someone else's dream as the God that they believe in,

37:59.320 --> 38:00.760
as opposed to what you believe in.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.440
That's a very sneaky piece of magic.

38:07.400 --> 38:13.640
I do know the method for inserting thoughts into other people's dreams in such a way that

38:13.640 --> 38:19.880
they will believe it's their own thought, because you wake up in the morning and not all the thoughts

38:19.880 --> 38:28.600
in your head do you immediately recognize, but a much more effective way is to have

38:29.320 --> 38:34.680
in that person's dream a figure who is their God appear to them and tell them,

38:35.240 --> 38:39.160
you must do this, you must do that, and then they can go, oh my God told you.

38:40.680 --> 38:44.760
If it's a Catholic, it may be a saint.

38:45.720 --> 38:52.600
If it's a pagan, then it may be a pagan God, but to incorporate that God into the

38:52.600 --> 38:56.120
delivery of the message makes it very highly effective.

38:57.240 --> 39:01.800
As well, Dr. Skinner, I think this next part touches on something that you brought up at

39:01.800 --> 39:06.600
the beginning of our chat and also something David Rankin talks about when he, in his

39:07.320 --> 39:12.920
Grimoire Encyclopedia, when he talks about the building of magical momentum or magical tension

39:12.920 --> 39:20.600
and you say, quote, that the mental effort involved in encoding the message to the spirit

39:21.160 --> 39:27.480
is part of the magical procedure, end quote. Can you share why is this so important, Dr. Skinner?

39:28.680 --> 39:33.960
Well, most people take a very casual attitude to magic. I'll just quickly

39:33.960 --> 39:39.160
rattle through the invocation and then I'll tell the spirit what I want. No, you have to use

39:39.160 --> 39:44.840
a lot of, I wouldn't say brain power, but a lot of intention.

39:47.320 --> 39:52.120
People will say that magic is mostly psychological. I definitely don't believe that,

39:52.760 --> 40:01.560
but I know that when you do it, it must be done with intention and carefully and precisely,

40:01.880 --> 40:06.520
which is why three of my books start with the word techniques of.

40:07.960 --> 40:17.560
Technique comes from a Greek word, which means a craft or a procedure. I like to think of

40:17.560 --> 40:25.080
magic as something that is done scientifically, but only scientifically in the sense of

40:25.960 --> 40:33.080
method. So you try something out, you record your results, you formulate series and that,

40:33.080 --> 40:37.880
and then you test the series. Well, it's not quite as complicated as that in magic,

40:37.880 --> 40:42.360
because a lot of the instructions are already available in the grimoires,

40:43.480 --> 40:51.560
and so you use them, but you use them carefully and with attention. Just as if you were driving or

40:51.560 --> 41:00.360
flying a rapid plane, you need attention and intention, otherwise you might come to a nasty,

41:00.360 --> 41:07.960
nasty sticky end. Yes, so you would consider Dr. Skinner this mental technique, this preparation

41:07.960 --> 41:13.480
of encoding the message as just as important as, say, gathering your materia magica, your wand,

41:13.480 --> 41:17.880
your sword, consecrating things. It sounds like it's that important to the technique.

41:18.440 --> 41:23.400
Yeah, yeah, and producing your ray of tools and people say to me, well, why do you need

41:23.400 --> 41:30.120
tools for magic? Why can't you just sit in your arm chair and think about it? That does not work,

41:32.360 --> 41:38.280
but at least it doesn't work for me. There may be people who can do that, but not anybody I

41:38.280 --> 41:46.600
immediately know. And you see the same thing in Chinese magic or even martial arts. I mean,

41:46.680 --> 41:53.240
there's a well-known story of a village which was being attacked by some raiders,

41:54.200 --> 42:06.120
and one of the team masters there tried to contract a samurai to teach them how to fight with

42:06.120 --> 42:12.840
swords and fight these people off who are destined to arrive in the next week or something. And of

42:12.840 --> 42:18.440
course, the master said, you've got to be kidding. I can't teach you what you need to know in a week.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.080
Tell me what you do know. And he said, well, I know how to do the tea ceremony. And I do that

42:25.080 --> 42:35.240
with a lot of attention. And I do that regularly. And I'm really a master of that. So the samurai

42:35.240 --> 42:42.120
simply taught him how to clean the sword and replace it in a scabbard and told him to apply

42:42.120 --> 42:49.960
the same degree of intention to that as he did to the tea ceremony. So when the raiders turned up,

42:51.320 --> 42:55.800
there was the team master pretending to be head of the village,

42:56.600 --> 43:04.040
and laid out in front of him was one or two pieces of equipment. And he cleaned them and

43:04.040 --> 43:08.760
presented them in the way that he would have done for the tea ceremony. And the raiders looked and

43:08.760 --> 43:14.680
they saw this guy treats his tools like this. He obviously knows what he's doing.

43:15.400 --> 43:24.600
We'll go and find an easier village to raid and they left. So the point of that slightly oblique

43:24.600 --> 43:32.360
story is that the weapons and they are called weapons of magical practice need to be treated

43:33.080 --> 43:40.680
great deal of respect and intention. And they need to be exercised and consecrated.

43:42.680 --> 43:49.400
And these actions then give them much more than psychological power, but it does give them

43:50.440 --> 43:56.520
power that then can work. And the spirits can appreciate that. They look at a magician who

43:56.520 --> 44:03.880
lays out his tools properly, leans them, wraps them in the right colored silk and so forth. And

44:03.880 --> 44:09.640
they figure, this guy knows what he's doing. We better not mess with him.

44:11.240 --> 44:18.360
People find it hard to understand when I explain it. But I think the Chinese team master

44:19.240 --> 44:23.000
is a good parallel. Absolutely. One of the ways I've phrased it is,

44:23.720 --> 44:27.480
based on everything that you've shared and Fraterashin Shasan and other guests is,

44:28.520 --> 44:34.280
instead of operating on the laws of physics, many grimoire interactions and evocatory procedures

44:34.280 --> 44:41.160
operate on the laws of meaning and intention and being able to meet them in a specific laid-down

44:41.640 --> 44:48.200
pre-mutually agreed upon terms and a specific ritualistic structure that gets results. I don't

44:48.200 --> 44:54.360
know if that's a fair way to think about it. And going back to previous conversation we had a few

44:54.360 --> 45:05.000
minutes ago, in the Greek magical papyri and in the old Egyptian temples, anybody who had just

45:05.000 --> 45:11.080
eaten garlic or fish was not allowed to come in and was certainly discouraged from doing any ritual

45:11.880 --> 45:18.280
or worship or ritual inside the temple because the spirits do have a great sense of smell.

45:19.480 --> 45:24.920
So the spirits can cotton on to what we're doing, that we're doing the right technique

45:25.800 --> 45:33.720
and that we are masters of what we are doing. And that instills a certain amount of fear and

45:33.720 --> 45:39.240
obedience. Dr. Skinner, in addition to those vital elements, one of the things that you mentioned

45:39.240 --> 45:45.400
that's necessary for the successful completion of an evocatory procedure in the grimoire tradition

45:45.400 --> 45:52.840
is the seal, the sigil of the spirit. And to that very point, the very few number of seals

45:52.840 --> 46:00.120
found in the Stegonographia match exactly to the seals found in the second book of the Lamegaten,

46:00.120 --> 46:07.160
namely the Theurgia Goetia. So can you share, Dr. Skinner, why doesn't the Stegonographia contain

46:07.160 --> 46:14.600
more of these seals? Right. So as I've already explained, to call the spirit, you need its seal

46:15.400 --> 46:20.360
so that it's not sufficient to have the Stegonographia. You've got the evocations,

46:20.360 --> 46:26.680
you've got the spirits' names, you've got the times, etc. But when Trasimius is writing that,

46:26.680 --> 46:33.080
he also composed the Theurgia Goetia, Don't Be Distracted by the Name,

46:34.040 --> 46:40.840
which I think is a later edition. And in that, he had the same spirits, but he had their seals.

46:41.400 --> 46:48.440
And he knew, being a sensible lad, that you should keep these two elements separate. However,

46:48.440 --> 46:52.200
if you're a practicing magician, then you need to bring these two elements together,

46:52.920 --> 46:58.280
and you use the seals in the Theurgia Goetia, which you've got the same spirit names as the

46:58.360 --> 47:04.760
invocations, etc. in the Stegonographia. So I suppose this is a little plug for,

47:05.720 --> 47:14.040
yes, if you're going to do this, you also need to buy Dr. Rudd's Goetia, because in there will be

47:14.040 --> 47:21.720
the seals that you need. I see that Alex is waving it around. Thank you very much. And that's another

47:21.800 --> 47:29.880
coincidence. It's part of my progress through the Grimoires to cover, hopefully, all the bases

47:31.000 --> 47:39.800
by the end of my time. I think historically, the Theurgia Goetia was made at the same time

47:39.800 --> 47:47.560
by Trasimius and kept separate. And its path as a manuscript has been different from the Stegonographia.

47:48.440 --> 47:54.200
But you can now, because they're both in English and they're both published by me,

47:54.200 --> 47:56.360
you can bring them together and make it work.

47:57.560 --> 48:03.720
It's a truly very, very valuable resource for people who want to read about it, for people who

48:03.720 --> 48:09.640
want to practice this. I'm certainly looking forward to it, Dr. Skinner. And just as a brief

48:09.640 --> 48:15.720
follow-up question, do you think the author of the Theurgia Goetia used tables to derive

48:16.360 --> 48:18.920
the numerous seals just as a follow-up to that?

48:20.440 --> 48:28.760
No. You don't use tables to derive the seals. This is a technical area I don't want to get into,

48:29.320 --> 48:34.280
but they were derived at the same time, I think, and then put in a separate manuscript.

48:35.000 --> 48:42.360
Of course, Trasimius, being the abbot, had all these monks in his scriptorium who would write

48:42.440 --> 48:47.320
stuff for him. So this is something I would have loved to have myself,

48:47.960 --> 48:53.480
instead of having to type it. I'm one finger typist, and I just type with one finger,

48:53.480 --> 48:59.960
and it's not nearly as fast as being able to hand some rough copy to a monk and say,

49:00.600 --> 49:08.440
go off and inscribe that on parchment or whatever, such luxury. But on the other hand,

49:09.000 --> 49:16.520
I don't have the inquisition looking over my shoulder or what was left of the English laws

49:16.520 --> 49:24.520
against magic, which I think they abolished in 1951, which is a bit late, but at least they've gone.

49:25.480 --> 49:30.040
So it's a trade-off. So I'm happy.

49:30.040 --> 49:35.160
Yes, those are powerful, motivating forces. And as a fellow one-finger type, or I certainly

49:35.160 --> 49:38.200
sympathize, Dr. Skinner, fully, fully, absolutely.

49:40.680 --> 49:47.160
My mother said, I said, I need to learn to type because I'm going to produce a few, more than

49:47.160 --> 49:52.600
a few words. And she said, no, you don't. You'll always have a secretary. Your father had a secretary.

49:52.600 --> 49:55.480
You'll have a secretary. You don't need to learn it. And then she was wrong.

49:58.040 --> 50:03.000
It's like, right. In addition to being the scholar and translating things and pouring

50:03.000 --> 50:08.520
over manuscripts and the welcome library, in addition to all of that, you also are then typing

50:08.520 --> 50:16.280
through everything, of course. Yes. I've tried one little program where you speak,

50:16.280 --> 50:21.640
and it types it up for you on the screen. But it always gets the technical words wrong.

50:21.640 --> 50:26.440
And so you've got to go back and retype. And in the end, I've timed myself. It's almost

50:26.440 --> 50:32.360
just as fast to type it yourself. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. It would be very hard to tell

50:32.360 --> 50:37.880
Microsoft Word or something to, you know, Bane Chuch or Adonai Shaddai El Chai, you know,

50:37.880 --> 50:42.680
it might, it might not get all the, all of the letters correct. Yeah. So you got to,

50:42.680 --> 50:46.200
you got to go back and rework and see, might as well type it in the first place.

50:47.080 --> 50:54.120
Right. Absolutely. That's just my problem, not anybody else's. Earlier, I asked you if you

50:54.120 --> 51:01.240
practiced the steganography and you shared your answer. But just as a follow-up, since you publicly

51:01.240 --> 51:06.680
shared about experimenting with the LeMegatins Goatia, as you've shared, and also the Arsonatoria,

51:07.240 --> 51:13.080
have you experimented with the Theurgia Goatia? Or, or is there anything else you'd like to

51:13.080 --> 51:18.120
touch on about experimenting with either the steganography or the Theurgia Goatia?

51:19.400 --> 51:25.560
Yes, I have. But because to actually do it right with the steganography, I need to

51:25.560 --> 51:31.320
re-import the sigils. And I thought when I produced this edition, maybe I should sneak

51:31.320 --> 51:37.640
the sigils back in, but that's not, it's not academically acceptable to do that. So you still

51:37.640 --> 51:44.120
got to put two books next to each other and, and work on it from there. I'm still working my way

51:44.120 --> 51:52.120
through the, what was it, 56, 57 spirits. There's some I'm just never going to get around to, but

51:52.120 --> 51:56.200
I've worked my way through handfuls of the more interesting ones.

51:56.760 --> 52:02.200
You were talking about the samurai story earlier, one of your magical colleagues and one of our

52:02.200 --> 52:07.640
magical friends, Frater Ashen Chassan, an excellent grimoire, a traditionalist and practitioner.

52:08.680 --> 52:13.320
He has a question for you, Dr. Skinner, saying, Dr. Skinner, can you please share about how

52:14.280 --> 52:19.160
the angels, or if the angels, inspired the techniques or the technology for the ciphers

52:19.240 --> 52:24.680
themselves, what are your thoughts on the angelic involvement in imparting the knowledge for coded

52:24.680 --> 52:32.280
information found in the steganographia? I don't think the angels taught Trasimius

52:33.000 --> 52:41.800
cryptography. For a start, a lot of Trasimius' cryptography is very, very stalled at having

52:41.800 --> 52:51.160
to translate a large, as I said before, say 100 words into a five-word message or something.

52:51.800 --> 52:57.800
It's just not practical. So I don't think they did. I think that you've got to give

52:57.800 --> 53:04.440
Trasimius' brain the credit for the cryptography. Thank you for that additional context, Dr. Skinner.

53:04.440 --> 53:10.120
And speaking of other guests who have been on the podcast, we have a listener question for you

53:10.120 --> 53:17.480
from Mihai Vartajaru, who is asking and saying, Dr. Skinner, are the 31 spirits listed in the

53:17.480 --> 53:23.480
steganographia actual spirits that may be contacted, or are the spirit names just an

53:23.480 --> 53:29.800
ideal spirit catalog devised by Trasimius as an example of his cryptographical method?

53:31.400 --> 53:39.080
Well, I've sort of answered that already. I can see that Mihai is working from old English

53:39.080 --> 53:46.200
translations, or even from the Latin, because he only mentions what was it, 31 spirits.

53:46.840 --> 53:52.360
Whereas, in fact, when you add in the second volume, you add another 25.

53:54.360 --> 54:02.120
No, the spirit names are real. They do come to you. They will come. And they will do work for

54:02.120 --> 54:09.800
you if you approach it in the right way. They're not just empty counters for his cryptography.

54:10.520 --> 54:17.480
Now, I admit that my bias is biting in here that I'm not interested in cryptography because

54:18.520 --> 54:29.480
there are now programs like some of the cyber currency things with passwords which are, I don't

54:29.960 --> 54:35.880
know, 56 letters long or something, which do cryptography well above anything that

54:36.680 --> 54:45.320
Trasimius could have done. But his magic still works. But his cryptography is still a bit slow.

54:46.600 --> 54:52.040
I don't think the angels provided it to him. If they had, it might have been a little bit more

54:52.040 --> 54:58.040
efficient. Yes, that's one of the things, among many, that I'm so thankful for is your insistence,

54:58.040 --> 55:02.280
Dr. Skinner, on practicality. I remember in a previous interview, you said that,

55:02.280 --> 55:06.600
and I'm inserting the word tortured here, but you even tortured yourself learning Demotic Greek,

55:06.600 --> 55:13.400
not for liturgical or the appreciation of history for practical use. So, you go to very

55:13.400 --> 55:22.600
far lengths to have a practical effect on the results of magic. Yes, learning Greek was just

55:23.560 --> 55:32.360
so much pain, but what worth doing. Absolutely. And you've touched on a few figures here,

55:32.360 --> 55:37.560
Dr. Skinner, historical figures and researchers, practitioners. We have a follow-up question

55:37.560 --> 55:44.440
for you from Mihai Vartajaru, who is asking, is Dr. Skinner aware of the 20th century Romanian

55:44.440 --> 55:51.640
historian, Ioan Petruculiano, who attempted to decipher Trasimius's cryptographic code?

55:53.480 --> 56:01.560
Yes, I'm very aware of Culiano. He's one of the academics who have actually done practical magic,

56:02.600 --> 56:09.160
which means that his other academic colleagues were a little bit wary of him,

56:09.160 --> 56:14.600
because he's not around anymore. And he left Romania and went across the States,

56:14.600 --> 56:21.400
where he finally worked at the University of Chicago. But terrible things happened to him.

56:22.120 --> 56:29.720
He was actually assassinated in the toilet block of the Divinity School of the University of

56:29.720 --> 56:38.440
Chicago. Now, why he was assassinated, I think, in my opinion, is because he kept

56:39.880 --> 56:46.120
abusing the post-Chachescu communist regime and saying bad things about them.

56:47.080 --> 56:53.880
He was certainly disliked by Chachescu. I have another story about Chachescu,

56:53.880 --> 57:02.600
which I probably shouldn't tell. But getting back to Mihai's question, yes,

57:03.880 --> 57:11.080
Culiano's book, Eros and Magic in the Renaissance is full of useful stuff. It's not

57:11.080 --> 57:17.640
greatly arranged. You don't go easily from one topic to another. But there are lots of gems

57:17.640 --> 57:24.840
scattered throughout that book. Shall I tell my Chachescu story? I've been wanting to ask you,

57:24.840 --> 57:32.600
yes, because you've teased it out so well. So please, sir. Okay. I worked for a publishing company,

57:33.160 --> 57:40.440
which was owned by Robert Maxwell. And Robert Maxwell knew Chachescu, because he was involved

57:40.440 --> 57:48.200
with a lot of Eastern European regimes. He also knew Brezhnev. He used to go drinking with him,

57:48.200 --> 57:52.760
which must have been quite the effort, because Brezhnev could really hold his booze.

57:54.920 --> 58:02.120
Anyway, in conversation, Chachescu asked Maxwell once, well, you know, I've got a bit of a bad

58:03.080 --> 58:09.880
image, certainly a very bad image, because he was doing lots of bad things. How do I clean

58:09.880 --> 58:17.880
my image up? And they came up with the idea, well, we should write a sort of vaguely sterilized

58:20.360 --> 58:26.920
biography saying all the great things you did. Of course, then it was up to Chachescu to think of

58:26.920 --> 58:35.000
some of the great things that he'd done, apart from demolishing about a quarter of his capital city

58:35.480 --> 58:41.400
to build one of the largest palaces ever seen. And he must have used an enormous amount of the

58:41.400 --> 58:51.080
country's wealth to do that. But that's another issue. Anyway, I'll not get too personal about

58:51.080 --> 59:02.200
this, but Maxwell hired with a bit of advice, somebody to write this book. And Chachescu provided

59:02.200 --> 59:09.800
tons and tons of information. Most of it had to be adjusted to make it sound good.

59:10.920 --> 59:21.000
And the book was written. And because I was involved, the book was printed. And I can't

59:21.000 --> 59:25.400
remember how many copies. It wasn't a lot of copies, because Maxwell didn't think it was

59:25.400 --> 59:31.640
still very well. But he needed to send 20 or 40 copies to Chachescu to show that he kept his

59:31.640 --> 59:39.880
side of the deal. Let me think, that must have been round about Christmas 1989,

59:41.080 --> 59:48.600
because I was working in publishing back in those days. And just as it was about to be launched,

59:48.600 --> 59:59.480
Chachescu was tried very quickly in one evening, taken out of the back and shot along with his wife

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:07.240
so that the opposition forces then took over Romania. And we were left with the

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:15.560
warehouse full of this made-up story about Chachescu. So I got an urgent message from Maxwell,

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:23.960
destroy it, destroy it. And I did. I kept two copies, which must rank amongst the

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:29.720
rarest copies in the world. And the rest went off. I can't remember whether it was

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.840
burning or shredding, but it was definitely completely destroyed.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.280
Just as a quick aside, you've had so many

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.160
involvements and fingerprints with other publications. For instance, I'm thinking of

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:46.520
the wonderful Black Easter novel with with Blish and the conversations that you've had.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:52.680
I'm thinking of that humorous yet very teachable story at university about Alice Bailey and this

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:59.640
person dropping off a truckload of books of Alice Bailey, too. So it seems like you're right that

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:05.960
in this case, I mean, this was a very intense personal involvement and literally being told

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:11.240
to destroy those books. I mean, wow, yeah. Someday actually had to do the dirty work of

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:19.640
destroying them. But the command came down from Maxwell, who I, because I was on his

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:28.520
magazine publishing site, I saw fairly frequently. But that's that's stories for another day.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:35.160
Given all this, Dr. Skinner, did Culliano deal with Trithemius's system and offered the first

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:40.120
version of an invocation of a spirit prince in his book about magic in the Renaissance?

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.960
Well, I have to correct that and say it wasn't the first

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:50.360
version of an invocation of a spirit prince because a lot of grimoires have been concerned with that

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:57.960
over the over the period, because spirits are quite hierarchical, or at least the way we understand

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:04.920
them is hierarchical. So they have princes and dukes, etc., which is mainly perhaps a reflection

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:10.600
of the way society was structured in the Middle Ages, where it could be actually some real

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:17.880
structuring. Culliano's story was not the first, but it was probably the first time

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:25.640
a professional academic had had explained that. Culliano used to make an offer to his

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:36.520
senior PhD students that they could learn magic with him, but only on condition that they did

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:42.600
each of the experiments as was taught by him. So he had a limited number of takers on that,

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:49.720
but he did actually teach practical magic to some of his students. All I can say is lucky them.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:56.200
When I was at university, I didn't get any offer like that and had to fight my own ways

01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:02.440
through the sources to find out how it works. You know, when it comes to technique and the

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.760
important elements of magic, you've been tracing this out for years, you've been connecting the

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:12.680
various techniques over, you know, thousands of years, and you and David Rankin in your

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:19.240
excellent collaborations, you mentioned that for a system like the Theurgia Goetia, that of course

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:25.560
is heavily dependent on the steganographia, that three elements are needed, the encoding of the

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:31.800
message, facing the correct direction, and the proper time of the day or the night. So

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.800
broadly speaking, do you feel, Dr. Skinner, that all three of these elements are vital to all

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:46.520
grimoireic operations and all grimoireic work? Yeah, basically, yes, but particularly time and

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:54.120
direction, because it's one thing that the spirits understand and we understand. And

01:03:54.200 --> 01:04:00.760
regards to timing, although some of the times listed in The Goetia,

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:08.200
which relate to the titles of the spirits, don't actually work that well.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:16.920
But timing that relates to the planetary hours and the planetary days, that works very well.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:27.560
And people ask me, well, why should calling a spirit at 8am on a Wednesday, a mercurial spirit,

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:34.600
work better than calling it when it's convenient for me at 6pm on Thursday?

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:44.280
And my answer to that is, well, if you want to talk to your doctor and you turn up this surgery at

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:55.560
3am on Sunday night, do you think you're going to get any help at all? And the answer is that spirits

01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:05.160
do have, what do you call it, not a schedule, not a thing, but there are times when it's good

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:12.440
to try and talk to them and there's times when it's not good. You wouldn't invoke a spirit of

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:21.640
Venus in a Saturnian hour on a Saturday, because you're stacking it against yourself if your

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:29.880
invocation is very powerful, maybe. But why make life difficult? And so timing is very important.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:36.760
The other thing about direction, well, as you can see from one of the illustrations that I showed

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:46.280
earlier, the spirits have specific directions. And if you wanted to talk to somebody and you

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:52.520
walked into their room and you turned your back to them whilst trying to convince them to do something,

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.560
they're going to think that's very rude and they're just not going to be helpful.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.600
Now, spirits may not think you're very rude. They may think you're a little bit stupid because

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:09.000
you don't know the correct direction. But I think that, well, I know that invocations,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.720
when invocations, which are done facing the correct direction work much, much better.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:24.440
So that's time and direction. This bears on the steganographia because the first two books have

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:31.400
got the spirit lists in them. One of the books deals only with direction, which is the first

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:40.680
book. And the second book deals only with time, which is the planetary hours, etc. So there you

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:46.520
are. It's very clear that two different sets of directions. I find in practice, if you get them

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:58.840
both right, then that's even better. The question of cryptographic things is not so important.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:05.400
Cryptographic is a bit important in steganographia, but there's a lot of magic where cryptography or

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:13.080
messing up the words in the way that AI is spare dead is not so important, but time and

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:20.200
direction are essential. Excellent. Thank you, Dr. Skinner. I know myself and I know the listeners

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:26.200
always appreciate those vital reminders no matter what grimoire direction you are looking at

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:32.520
exploring. That's excellent. We also have a listener question for you, Dr. Skinner, a few from

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:38.680
Andrew Nichols. And Andrew is saying, in the first part of the question, we broke these up a

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:44.520
little bit, I'm not as familiar with Dr. Skinner's work as I hope to be one day. So forgive me if

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:49.560
this has already been covered in his work, but as someone living in Australia, I'm frequently

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:56.040
confronted by the northern hemisphere-centric nature of the majority of the esoteric and

01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:02.280
goetic canon. As a fellow, Antipodian, who has spent at least some of his career based south of

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.960
the equator, I wonder if Dr. Skinner has any thoughts about how to navigate this.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:16.120
Okay. Well, this is a very interesting question for me because it is applicable to magic, but it's

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:22.920
also applicable to my other great interest, which is classical Chinese Feng Shui. And I don't mean

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:29.800
simply moving your furniture around or painting a wall red or whatever else. I mean, the really

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:37.960
classical stuff which I have been interested in for a long time. And that question is asked, well,

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:42.680
if all these Feng Shui rules work for the northern hemisphere, what do we have to do in the southern

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:49.080
hemisphere? Should we flip them on their head? Because climatically, the warm bits are in the

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:56.120
north, as is the thing from in Europe, the warm bits are in the south. And the quick answer is no,

01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:05.480
you shouldn't. Because although climatically, the two hemispheres are quite different. In fact,

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:12.840
in terms of direction, they're the same because east is the same direction in the northern hemisphere

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:19.560
as it is in the southern hemisphere. West is also the same direction. Even north and south

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:27.880
are the same direction. It doesn't all scramble as you go across the equator. And then further to that,

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:35.240
as I lived in Singapore for 14 years, Singapore is very close to the equator. You could almost

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:42.520
say it's on the equator. And I did not notice walking from one side of the island to the other any

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:52.760
difference. Nor did I notice anything in Indonesia south of the equator that's distinct from Singapore.

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:58.760
And so the short answer is no, you don't have to flip things either for feng shui or for magic.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:06.840
So also for feng shui, it's much clearer because direction is a very big thing in feng shui.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:17.480
It's also very important in magic. And no, you don't have to bend it around. Oh, the other thing,

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:27.880
I had a friend who said that if we're doing horoscopes, the seasons are different. So

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:37.880
you should flip the horoscopes as well. So I said, okay, give me a detailed analysis of myself.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:43.320
And he produced something which was diametrically opposite to everything that I'm made up of.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:52.680
And that killed it for me that no, you don't need to mess around like that. It's just

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.960
perfectly good to use the same rules in both atmospheres.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:05.880
And this follows Dr. Skinner with materia magica, I would assume as well, because

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:11.160
Andrew is asking and saying, for example, does Dr. Skinner feel it would be more efficacious to

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.880
cheat quote unquote by buying a hazel wand online or to experiment with substituting

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:26.120
an Australian tree so that I can cut the branch myself? Okay, the essential thing is it should

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:33.240
be hazel, not that you should cut it yourself. If you've got the hazel and you've bought it

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:38.280
through Amazon and somebody else has cut it on the other side of the world, it doesn't matter.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:46.440
You still have an hazel wand. And the spirits will know that if you turned up with a eucalyptus

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:53.320
wand waving it around, this is not hazel wand. And then they'll just ignore it.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:03.240
So you don't need to do a special change. And besides which, if you decided to just

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:07.480
select a different tree, you might have to go through 100 different varieties of tree before

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:15.800
you got one that was even halfway as good as hazel. So stick with the plan. Don't unnecessarily

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:27.320
mess it around. As Frida Ash and Jason once said, you still have to make changes on some of the

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:35.880
some of the magical procedures, but they're usually quite small and they're usually not

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:43.000
to make life more convenient for you so that you can have any old stick rather than a hazel wand.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:51.480
Yes, it's about putting in putting in the work and putting in the effort. And I very much appreciate

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:57.160
Andrew's question and you sharing your expertise, Dr. Skinner, because those questions, I think

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:02.520
do come up when people wonder, especially in this global chipping world and everything else. So

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:08.760
that is lovely. And Andrew also has a final question as well, Dr. Skinner saying, okay,

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:16.520
while moving from hazel wands to say, with seasonal timings or the dates of pagan festivals that

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:21.640
align with the seasons, which I know is moving away somewhat from Dr. Skinner's area of expertise,

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:27.400
but he's mentioning as an example, can these Dr. Skinner be transferred south of the equator

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:35.560
wholesale or should they also be flipped? Okay, well, we'll start with saying not flipped, but

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:47.880
if it's a cultural thing, then maybe you do have to adhere to its site of origin. So for example,

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:53.720
I can tell you from practical experience that dealing with spirits like fairies

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:03.800
works quite efficiently in Wales or Scotland in Celtic areas. But trying to invoke those same

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:13.560
entities in Singapore does not work or it doesn't work for me anyway. So there is an element of

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:22.600
that, but you don't just flip it, you don't then say, well, we'll invoke a demon of some other source

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:31.640
simply because we're in the southern hemisphere. No. So you have to, for spirits, they are sometimes

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:38.680
located in particular areas and they will not happily go from there. Most demons however,

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:45.640
are available throughout the world. If they're called right, they will come because they're not

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:51.880
culturally embedded in one particular area or another. So following through on cultural embedding,

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:59.640
if you're trying to call an Australian Aboriginal spirit, you will not have much

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:07.880
of a chance outside of Australia or indeed outside of some of the more barren areas of Australia.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:15.160
Which is the same thing as don't try calling fairies in Singapore.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:23.640
Yes. And some of the spirits, as you so excellently delineated Dr. Skinner, for instance,

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:27.800
in the steganographia, these are sub-lunar spirits. These are not cathonic spirits,

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:33.240
but it sounds like it would be fair to say that spirits found in the steganographia,

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:39.800
the Lemegetans' Goat Asia, the Ariel Kings and the Heptameron, these are not spirits that are bound by

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:46.200
a specific section of the globe. These can be called pretty much no matter where you are if

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:51.960
you follow the appropriate method. Would that be somewhat fair? Yep. Yeah. That's definitely fair.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:58.280
I picked two extreme examples which are very culturally connected to the Australian

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:05.560
aborigines and the fairies, but for most other spirits, they are available throughout the world.

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:11.160
Excellent. Well, Dr. Skinner, returning to this theme of techniques, for example,

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.480
I've seen this online and I'd just love to run this by you. You see this kind of

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:25.800
general misconception online that, and again, this is a false dichotomy and almost a caricature,

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:32.360
but some people might say, well, solematic magicians, they're purists who want to reduce

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:39.240
the grimoires to only cookie-cutter mathematical steps that are mechanical and repeatable,

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.720
and it's sterile. And when I'm online and I say I do the grimoire this way, I have a grimoire

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:49.880
or a purist saying, no, you need to do it this way. But to me, talking with you, Frater Ashton

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:57.480
I mean, so many practitioners, I get the opposite that this is very, very much based on

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:04.200
the methods, the scientific method, but it's also based on developing your own individual

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:09.960
relationships with spirits. So can you kind of share about this conception or misconception

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:15.560
that people might have, Dr. Skinner, about it only being a strictly mechanical process?

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:24.120
So there's several elements there. It is mechanical in the sense that you have to do

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:34.120
the right things to make it work. If you burn tar and stand on a beach without a circle or

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:41.320
something, it's not going to work. You have to do the right actions with the right tools in the right

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:53.960
place. But that's not cookie-cutter, is it? So don't confuse that with my own scientific approach

01:17:53.960 --> 01:18:02.840
to it. But with any technique, if you're a brain surgeon, you need to attack the right part of the

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:10.280
brain, not with a spoon and fork, but with the right equipment. And you need to do it at the right

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:18.120
time when the person is under anesthesia. Otherwise, you'll cause terrible problems.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:27.960
So yes, you need to observe the rules. But that doesn't make you cookie-cutter. Magic is not

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:37.000
simple. You have to work at it quite hard. Ashton Chase initially did a number of operations

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:43.000
where people would have just given up, but he persisted and then he figured out what was the

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:50.920
small change that needed to be done to make it work right. Then the other thing is a lot of

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:59.000
people say that you need to create a special bond with the spirits. That is certainly true

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:08.680
if you're trying to create or encourage a familiar. But if you're just using, and I say

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:14.280
using, because I mean using, one spirit for one particular action and you may not call them again

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:21.640
for a long time, such bonds are not necessary. But the correct procedure is still necessary.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.360
So would it be fair to say, Dr. Skinner, just to button up this topic, if someone's out there

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:32.440
listening, they love your books, they're reading about the Solomonic method, and if they're wondering,

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:39.240
well gosh, why is Dr. Skinner so focused on repeatability and the steps? I think it would be

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:45.480
fair to say that you can easily teach the steps, but it's not so easy with personal relationships

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:50.360
because those are so idiosyncratic. They're based on your unique interaction. Would that be fair?

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:57.080
That's absolutely true. Let me draw one more parallel, which I previously done.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:06.840
Working with spirits, invoking them and training them, if you like, to answer and do the things you

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:13.720
want, is just like working with a, trying to domesticate a horse. If you get a wild horse,

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:19.880
there are several ways you can do it, you know, but you will certainly need to put a hold on.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:27.400
You will certainly need to have them in an enclosed space. In this case, the horse needs to be kept

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:34.600
inside the railings of the park, unlike spirits which need to be kept outside the railings of

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:43.960
the magical circle. Then you can't just shout at them in English or Latin or Hebrew. You need to

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:55.240
actually use tools like sugar lumps, or if you're a harsh person, a whip, but you need to have these

01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:02.040
tools to domesticate a horse and you need to observe the same rules. There's a fast way to

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:08.840
domesticate a horse and a very slow way. If you make up your own way, it probably will take forever

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:14.680
and it won't succeed, but if you use the standard procedure, you will domesticate the horse and then

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:21.880
you will later ride it safely and you'll need to harness it unless you're very clever at bareback

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:29.400
riding. It's like any task, you need to do it the right way. You don't need to cookie cut it,

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:38.040
but you need to do a method which has been proved to work in the past so that that's all.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:46.600
David Rankin in the Grimoire Encyclopedia mentions that in his decades of experience with, for

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:52.680
instance, the LeMegatinsk Oasia, and I'm probably paraphrasing or butchering this, but he effectively

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:59.720
said he didn't find he needed to use, in the goetic context, more of the putting the sigil

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:06.840
in the fire and burning specific foul-smelling things, but that over time using the barrel

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:13.720
and ensis conjuration, using certain aspects of the vinculum that he could get those results.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.240
Does that kind of go to what you're saying about, hey, there are various techniques,

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:22.680
there are various paths, but the goal should always be to engage with the spirit so that it

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:28.360
is successfully called and bound? Yes. The procedure is that you should use,

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:37.800
first of all, as close as possible to the standard Grimoire procedure. It's only later when you can

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:44.520
do it and you can call the spirit and direct it two or three times, then you can ask it,

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:51.240
how would it be easier for me to call you if the spirit says, well, if you have a radish

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:56.840
present on the altar, then it will work much better. That's a bad example, but you will get

01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:03.480
information from the spirit and then you can use it. As David has been working at this for a very

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:12.040
long time, he has modified stuff, but these people who start and decide immediately they want to

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:22.680
modify it, oh, I'll use a kitchen spoon rather than a wand and I'll do this and I'll do this.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:28.600
This is not going to work and you're just hobbling your progress.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:39.400
I should add that since my first evocations, I have now been doing magic for 60 years and

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:49.720
not that I'm 60, I'm somewhat older than 60. During that time, I have had to work really hard to

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:56.520
get the message to work for me, but once they're working for me, then I can make slight changes

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:04.440
in things and then it's repeatable. Because it's a technology, it is repeatable. You don't want to

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:11.880
have to climb the mountain every single time and you can come back and even shorten the technique,

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:17.320
but you've got to do it right first and have it succeed and then after that you can think about

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:24.680
what you might like to change. I can't hack it with pupils who want to change everything to start

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:31.240
with. I want to do it in the weekend and I want to do it without the right tools and I'll use

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:39.240
my brain and none of that works. Right, exactly. Just substituting Thor for every reference to

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:45.720
Adonai in the Hepatameron would not be a good first step in the ritual. I think that's safe to

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:53.640
say, yes. Absolutely. Okay. Well, thank you, Dr. Skitter. So listeners, we just have a few more

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:58.360
questions for Dr. Skitter and a very brief aftershow about some interesting points about

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:04.520
consecration. But before we get there, listeners, I just want to remind you, please check the podcast

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:12.200
and video descriptions to click on the link to pre-order your copy of Dr. Steven Skitter and

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:19.640
Daniel Clark's steganographia. The links will be below. But Dr. Skitter, just as we get ready to

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:23.960
wrap up the main part of the podcast, you're always working on something. I remember you said

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:28.600
that you have a list in front of you of many different projects and as you go through, you pick

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.200
and cross some of them off. So can you give us any hints about what other projects you are working on

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:44.680
right now? Yeah, this is my latest project. You only get a quick look at that and you can see my

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:57.080
penciling on the Latin. And it's another book by Etrusemius. And it's to do with the origin of

01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:05.560
many of the grimoires. And so it is faintly complementary to David Rankine's fantastic

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:12.680
grimoire encyclopedia, for which there's no replacement at all. This is merely a supplement

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:21.000
that which I hope people will like. And that project is 85% finished,

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:25.720
but it will take a while before it finishes up on bookshelves.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:33.880
Excellent, Dr. Skitter. I know myself and I know the thousands of listeners are very... We'll keep

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:39.240
our ear to the ground on that, as always. Can you tell us, Dr. Skitter? Of course, listeners can

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:46.520
click the links below and pre-order their copy of the book. And how else can they support you? How

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.880
can they check out your other works? Obviously, I'm thinking of Golden Horde Press, but anything

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:58.280
else you'd like to share with listeners, how they can best support you? Well, I'm always interested

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:03.880
in people telling me, you know what you should do next? You should translate. You should do this.

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:12.200
You should do that. Or several people have said, you should catalog your own experiments.

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:23.240
That's a hell of a big task, spread over a large number of years. So, suggestions like that are

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:30.920
always welcome. I may not immediately answer you because I get something close to 200 emails a week.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:41.160
And so, sorting through it takes a fair slice of time. But if you do come up with a good idea

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:48.200
for stuff which has not been done but should have been done, then I would truly love to hear from you.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:55.240
That was excellent. So, listeners, make sure to reach out to Dr. Skitter. If you have any

01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:00.920
suggestions on upcoming projects, Dr. Skitter is always dealing with a menagerie of different

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:06.760
projects. But if there's any other suggestions, please feel free to send those to Dr. Skitter as

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:12.440
well. Dr. Skitter, I know we have a very brief aftershow, but is there anything else about the

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:19.160
steganographia, trithymias, anything else at all, salamonic, evocatory aspects that you'd like

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:26.600
to leave listeners with? Oh, well, there's always lots of stuff to talk about. But with regard to

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:36.120
trithymias, as a person, he has lost a lot of fame that he was due. It's like John Dee. And for the

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:48.920
same reason that the powers that be depressed the story of their lives. I mean, if you ask the

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:55.560
average person, even involved in magic, what about trithymias? Quite a lot of people won't know. And

01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:01.160
if you'd asked people about John Dee back in the 50s, they wouldn't have had any idea either.

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:17.800
So in restoring his work, that has been fun. Well, yeah, and it's got to be into English. It can't

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:23.640
be back into that because there are very few people now that read the classical languages.

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:35.000
My degree was in classics. So I focused on that in Greek. And then I did formal courses in Hebrew

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:43.720
as well, because I realized that that was necessary for magic. But none of those are very good in

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:55.320
traveling around. Certainly classical Greek doesn't work in Greece. And my Hebrew pronunciation is

01:29:55.320 --> 01:30:01.960
probably a bit crap and probably doesn't work in Israel, although there are other problems

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:07.480
happening there at the moment. I know Dr. Skinner myself and the listeners truly appreciate your

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:13.000
time. International author, scholar, he's collaborating again with Daniel Clark in this

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:19.720
upcoming tome, all four books of trithymias' steganographia for the first time presented

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:25.800
and translated in English together. Dr. Steven Skinner, thank you so, so much as always for

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:30.120
just taking the time and sharing your wisdom on the podcast today. Really appreciate it.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:37.960
Well, I do as well, because you do ask the most interesting questions. And you understand the

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:46.920
subject, which is more than you can say for some of the podcasts. But anyway, well, thanks, Alex.
