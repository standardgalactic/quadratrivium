00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Salutations, listeners, and welcome back to Glitch Bottle, the podcast where we uncork

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,240
the uncommon in magic, mysticism, and the generally misunderstood.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,240
I'm your host, Alexander F., and today, as usual, we are so excited and honored to talk

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,180
about decrypting the Stegonographia with international author and scholar Dr. Steven

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,180
Skinner.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,340
Now, listeners, I know you might be asking yourself, why is the Stegonographia the most

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:36,780
notorious work of the German Benedictine, Abbott, and polymath, Johannes Tritemius?

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,140
It was written in the year 1500.

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,220
Is the Stegonographia a text about the evocation of spirits?

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,780
Is it a system of cryptography where information is secretly encoded or both?

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,940
Internationally acclaimed author, practicing magician, and scholar Dr. Steven Skinner

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,020
is the perfect person to ask as he returns on the podcast.

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,380
Dr. Skinner has again collaborated with Daniel Clark in an upcoming publication where all

14
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,900
four books of the Stegonographia are being published in English for the first time with

15
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,220
extensive explanations and commentary.

16
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,540
It sounds like it is just going to be so vital and so excellent as usual.

17
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:28,100
This upcoming edition of the Stegonographia contains the remaining parts of books one

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,500
and three with detailed spirit registers covering 32 spirits, but it also features a full translation

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,580
of book two, which contains another 25 spirits and book four, which relates the Stegonographia

20
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,780
to Paracelsus, the Almadel, and the Shemham Farrash of Solomon, Adam, and Moses.

21
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,100
So this looks to be absolutely an excellent collection and a scholarly and important restoration

22
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,020
of the grimoire tradition of the magical tradition broadly speaking.

23
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,380
And with all that being said, Dr. Steven Skinner, thank you so, so much for taking the time

24
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,420
and stopping back on the Glitch Bottle podcast today.

25
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,380
It's always my pleasure and I do enjoy talking to you.

26
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,500
And you just summed it up perfectly.

27
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,340
I don't really need to say anything more too high.

28
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,340
Well, yes, sir.

29
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,260
But I will, because you can't shut me up anyway, nor would I ever want to.

30
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,220
I was going to say no comment, please.

31
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:38,140
So I could just mention, first of all, what does Stegonographia mean when it comes as

32
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:47,660
Alex has said it is sometimes seen as a cryptography manual and sometimes seen as a magic manual.

33
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,660
So I have to admit upfront, I know a bit about cryptography, but I'm not a cryptographic

34
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
expert.

35
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,340
But I do know a little bit about magic.

36
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,540
So the focus of this book is primarily in the magical direction rather than the cryptographic

37
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,540
direction.

38
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,500
But I'll explain all later.

39
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,380
So what does the word Stegonographia mean?

40
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,620
Well, it's made up of two Greek words.

41
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:19,260
And the usual translation is that it's secret writing, Stegopo secret and Graphia writing.

42
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:27,380
But if you look at the Greek properly, Stegano actually means watertight and Graphia is writing.

43
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,260
So it's actually a book of watertight writing.

44
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,100
And we may come to that a little bit later.

45
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,420
At least people now have heard of it and they stopped saying, is it a book of shorthand

46
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,420
or stenography?

47
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,620
In fact, I've had arguments with people about the spelling of it.

48
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,660
Oh, it should be Stegonographia, shouldn't it?

49
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,620
No, it's Stegonographia.

50
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,180
Okay, so who wrote it?

51
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,140
Well, the Abbott Trasimius.

52
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:07,060
Now, this is an amazing thing that an Abbott, well-known in Germany, actually wrote books

53
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:17,460
on magic and the Inquisition didn't turn up on his doorstep or drag him off in chains

54
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:24,620
because he had powerful friends like Maximilian, the Emperor Maximilian, etc.

55
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:31,580
But you had to do a little bit more than just have powerful friends to avoid the Inquisition

56
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,900
and their pals.

57
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,540
So the question is, was it a book on stenography with a bit of magic thrown in or a book on

58
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,060
magic with a bit of stenography thrown in?

59
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:51,660
And you have to ask yourself, if you were an Abbott in the year 1500 in Germany, which

60
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,660
of those two things would be the most inflammatory?

61
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,220
And the answer is, you're more likely to be done for magic than to be done for writing

62
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,380
secret messages.

63
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:11,420
So my conclusion from a long time is that it's a book on magic with cryptography thrown

64
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,660
in so that Trasimius had deniability.

65
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,220
If he was ever grabbed by the Inquisition, he could say, no, it's a book on secret writing.

66
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,220
Can't you see that?

67
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,260
Are you stupid or something?

68
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,500
And it's not, it's a book on magic.

69
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:40,140
And in it, there are, what was it, 57 spirits with full details, 25 plus 31, I think.

70
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:46,500
So that's 56 spirits.

71
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,060
And it's practical.

72
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,420
Now, how did Trasimius get into trouble with it?

73
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:04,660
Well, he sent a copy of it to his friend who was in Ghent and who was a Carmelite monk.

74
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,900
And he knew this guy was okay talking about magic.

75
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:17,820
And when he sent it, because the mail was not perhaps as fast as it is today, his friend

76
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,660
in the Carmelite monk had actually died.

77
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,940
So when it arrived, the head of the monastery there opened it, looked at the book and was

78
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:36,100
completely shocked because what is one of the church senior members, an abbot was a

79
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,980
fairly senior title, were doing writing a book on magic.

80
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:49,020
And that unfortunately for Trasimius is where his reputation as a magician began.

81
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:56,660
And he spent the rest of his life fairly cleverly sending it off and explaining what it really

82
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,660
was.

83
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:06,080
Anyway, so Trasimius was an abbot, a historian, a magician.

84
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,560
And a monk.

85
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,160
And how did that happen?

86
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,600
Well, I'm sure everybody said this story, but I'm just going to tell it because I like

87
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,480
this story.

88
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:23,440
He was coming back from having visited his family in Trittenheim and he was stopped by

89
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,040
a snowstorm.

90
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,720
So he pulled in, as it were, if he'd been driving, it would have been, to the local monastery

91
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,600
which put him up for the night.

92
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,120
The next morning he set out again, where the looked okay.

93
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,560
He didn't go very far and then a huge snowstorm came again.

94
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,280
And so he was forced to go back and plead, do you mind if I stay the night again here?

95
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,520
And I think he probably privately thought that it was the hand of God telling him this

96
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,720
is where he was supposed to be.

97
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,800
So instead of moving on on the third morning, he decided to join the monastery as an ordinary

98
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
monk.

99
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:15,440
He was in his late teens, but being an incredibly intelligent man who read and spoke a number

100
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,320
of languages, definitely Latin, definitely German, probably a dash of Hebrew, et cetera,

101
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,640
and some Greek.

102
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,560
The monks realized what a powerhouse intellect he was.

103
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,480
And when he was 22, maybe 23, they elected him as the abbot of the monastery.

104
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:45,000
And from then on it was up and up until the point where he sent his, unfortunately, deceased

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,160
friend, a copy of the Stegonographia.

106
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,840
One minor thing that people probably never mention is that his original name was Heidenberg

107
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,840
which literally translates from German as from the pagan mountain, which I think is

108
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,280
a lovely way of looking at his name.

109
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,680
But he took Trusenius to celebrate the fact that he was born in Trittenheim.

110
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,480
So it was a man from Trittenheim who became his name.

111
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,320
He was also the teacher of a gripper and to a lesser extent of Paracelsus.

112
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:31,480
But the gripper utilized his huge library of magical books to learn about magic and

113
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,760
then finally to write about it.

114
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,960
And I think nobody's going to argue if I said that a gripper's three books of occult

115
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:47,760
philosophy is probably the main text of Western magic.

116
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,760
So you could see Trusenius as being, if not the fountain head, at least a fountain head

117
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:01,320
of European magic and the actual fountain head was his library, but I'll talk about

118
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,360
his library a little bit later.

119
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,000
So Dr. Skinner, given all of that historical background with Trusenius, can you share about

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,680
what differences did you find between the printed Latin text and the manuscript that

121
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,200
you worked from?

122
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,040
Right.

123
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,080
So when I started this project, I was looking around and I saw that Adam McClain had actually

124
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:35,400
made a decent English translation, but he only translated volume one and volume three,

125
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,440
leaving volume two and volume four untranslated.

126
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,200
If anybody wonders whether there really was a volume four, then you just look at Culliana's

127
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,200
book, Eros and Magic in the Renaissance, where he confirms that there were actually

128
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,160
four books originally.

129
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,440
Anyway, so I was lucky.

130
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:07,200
In fact, it was Daniel Clarke, my co-author, who was lucky because he uncovered a manuscript

131
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,320
of the Stegonographia, which was not as old as the German manuscripts, but much more detailed.

132
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:22,720
So it was obviously translated at the point before people started losing or destroying

133
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,880
manuscripts.

134
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,320
And so as you can see on this picture, the illustrations were a bit sketchy.

135
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,280
This one just shows a few of the directions.

136
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,840
And people mostly thought, well, it was just an example of some directions, but no.

137
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:46,600
In the original manuscript by Josemius, which we don't have to hand, he showed all the directions.

138
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:55,080
So in the manuscript I worked on with Daniel, you can see much, much more detail.

139
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:03,680
So realizing that this manuscript that Daniel dug up had two more volumes and a lot more

140
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,680
detail and illustrations, which were much more complete.

141
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,960
I thought we got to translate it.

142
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,320
So and that was a mistake.

143
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,720
I mean, if I'd realized how much work had to go into this, I would not have made that

144
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
decision.

145
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,720
But anyway, I did make the decision and we went for it.

146
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,160
Well, that that is so lovely, Dr. Skinner.

147
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,760
And I think it actually follows a really interesting point that you made sharing many years ago

148
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,440
that when you first came across text.

149
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,400
So for instance, I remember a story and I forgive me, I'm going to butcher some of the facts,

150
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,000
but you were very young and you went to the local bookstore and you were trying to, I

151
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,760
believe it was the LeMegatins' Goat Asia or Crowley's.

152
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,920
It was. Yes.

153
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,080
And I love that when you would you win in and said, I would like to I have an order for this.

154
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,120
And the person up front said, oh, no, no, he's much too young.

155
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,600
And then finally, I think it was the manager that came front forward and said, oh, Steven,

156
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,680
he's he's fine.

157
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,400
It's OK.

158
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,720
You know, and I thought, what a what a powerful story about, especially at the time, you know,

159
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,640
discovering a text for the first time.

160
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,080
So to that point, Dr. Skinner, can you share with us when did you first come across this

161
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,720
specific text, the Stegonographia?

162
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:34,160
OK, but just to add a little bit to the anecdote you told there, the bookshop manager, it was

163
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,880
the Adiar Bookshop in Sydney and the manager was Cecil Novi, who has very sadly passed away

164
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,400
very recently, but she was a lovely lady and she was aware of the fact that it was fairly

165
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,680
safe to leave the Goatia in my hands.

166
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,360
And thank God she did because an awful lot of work came out of that.

167
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,640
Anyway, when did I first come across it?

168
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,680
Well, I'd been interested in Dr.

169
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,440
John Dee from way back.

170
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,200
And we're talking 13, 14, we're talking pretty precocious.

171
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:20,120
And in it, the reading about Dee, I heard that Dee had once copied by hand the whole

172
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:27,760
of the Stegonographia, sitting somewhere in, I guess, Germany, working from a Latin manuscript.

173
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,240
And I thought, well, if Dee thought it was that valuable, that it was worth the considerable

174
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,640
effort of copying by hand.

175
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,360
And here you can actually see a copy of that copy.

176
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,680
You can see that Dee had done a lot of work and his his illustration there is much more

177
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,120
complete than the printed one.

178
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:57,880
So I figured that the printed copies, even in German, were not as complete as some of

179
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,040
the manuscript copies.

180
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,040
So that was my first desire.

181
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,720
Wow.

182
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
If Dee thought it was good, it's got to be good.

183
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:13,000
And then Adam McClain, who is a guy who's very famous for his knowledge of alchemy,

184
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,720
arranged a partial translation of Volume 1 and 3 in 1982.

185
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,920
And by comparing it with the Latin, I realized that books two and four were missing.

186
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,080
So that gave me more reason still to produce a complete copy.

187
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,400
I decided to translate all four books into English, again, a foolish decision.

188
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,720
When I was convinced that there actually were four books and not just that three that

189
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,800
people had mentioned.

190
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,480
Ah, there you go.

191
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,200
Well, I believe and I try not to speak for the listeners, Dr.

192
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,160
Skinner, but your foolishness and the foolishness of Daniel Clark and everyone else has

193
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,200
certainly been to the to the boon of pushing the boundaries of understanding of the

194
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,080
Grimoire tradition.

195
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,920
So I must say, it certainly is a wonderful thing.

196
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,840
And speaking of Daniel Clark, actually, Dr.

197
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:18,120
Skinner, can you tell us this is several times now you have collaborated with Daniel

198
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,480
Clark.

199
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,600
How did how did this process work?

200
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,560
You know, you have two great minds tackling this text.

201
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,360
Can you tell us about that relationship?

202
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,520
Well, I have to admit, I've never met Daniel.

203
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,080
It's all been online communication.

204
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,720
But the communication has been very good because Daniel has got an amazing

205
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,200
brain.

206
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:46,560
He's located down in Tasmania, and I was originally located in Malaysia and then

207
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,000
Singapore and now London.

208
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,200
But Daniel has his hand on where all of these manuscripts come from.

209
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,320
More than anybody else, I know he has an insight into which collections have got

210
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,440
which manuscripts and how to get copies of it and has a huge digital

211
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,120
collection.

212
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,440
And he was very generous from day one in lending them to me if I wanted to work

213
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,880
on them and finally I decided, well, let us work together.

214
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,000
He's a delightfully clearheaded guy and he doesn't take any kind of bullshit.

215
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,960
He's just does what he needs to do.

216
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,040
So we worked on it together and Daniel's many skills included dealing with these

217
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:45,400
libraries who hold their own manuscripts, but also research and repairing, digitally

218
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,600
repairing the manuscripts so that you go from something which looks appalling to

219
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
something which is actually very clear.

220
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,480
And if you can see here one that of the same picture that Daniel has restored,

221
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,360
so we've used his restorations in the book, it's so much better than trying to

222
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,560
look at the original.

223
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,240
We don't redraw them, no, we just take the original and clean it.

224
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,680
As well, Dr. Skinner, something you touched on at the beginning of our chat is that as

225
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,760
Joseph H. Peterson says, quote, the Stegonographia is Trithemis' most notorious

226
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,240
work. In private circulation, the Stegonographia brought such a reaction

227
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,400
of fear that he, Trithemis, decided it should never be published, end quote.

228
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,520
So Dr. Skinner, can you share with the listeners who might be hearing

229
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,920
about this for the first time?

230
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,320
Why was this work so notorious, if you will?

231
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,960
Well, I suppose the first push at being notorious was the

232
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,400
the Carmelite head of the monastery opening somebody else's mail and reading it

233
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,720
with horror, because he didn't just then put it on one side, but he sent copies

234
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,920
around and told other people about it.

235
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:12,160
Not very reasonable of him, but so that started off and people then sort of took

236
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,760
up, oh, this arbiter is doing magic, he's invoking spirits because here are all

237
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,880
the details in this book, blah, blah, blah.

238
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,600
And Trithemis then had a bit of a job tamping this down.

239
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,400
But the bottom line is that in dealing with spirits in this way was not natural

240
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,680
magic. And in those days, scholars, monks, et cetera, use the word natural

241
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,280
magic as defense.

242
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,560
So the church could go, hey, what are you doing?

243
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,120
And they say, no, we're just doing natural magic.

244
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,280
Herbs and stones and the 15 different varieties of correspondences, which

245
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,400
everybody knew about in those days, but they don't know.

246
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:07,200
And nothing about dealing with spirits in standing in a circle and stuff like that.

247
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,000
But of course, that is not the sort of magic that's in the Stegonographio.

248
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,040
It is spirit-based, evocatory magic.

249
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:26,880
They go and Trithemis destroyed or suppressed the more extreme parts to

250
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,200
save his reputation.

251
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,960
But fortunately, some of the translations, including the one we work from,

252
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,240
escaped without being too heavily cut.

253
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,600
There is always a possibility that we haven't got the most complete

254
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,320
manuscript in existence, but I can be very sure that it's...

255
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,680
I can't think of a percentage, but it's twice as complete as any of the other

256
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,200
manuscripts wandering around or even the printed version, because the printed

257
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,760
version was from an early Latin version.

258
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,760
One of the first times, Dr. Skinner, that I heard about this debate with

259
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,560
the Stegonographio, is it cryptography?

260
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,680
Is it sorcery?

261
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,520
Was actually, and I'll reach in my bookshelf here, one of my favorite tomes,

262
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,920
the Goetia of Dr. Rudd, the third volume in the Sourceworks of Ceremonial

263
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,800
Magic series, where you and David Rankin explore this issue and you touched

264
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,600
on it just a few moments ago, Dr. Skinner.

265
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,280
So I'll just ask, you mentioned that the Stegonographio is a book about magic,

266
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:36,040
not cryptography, but what is the relationship between encoding messages

267
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,560
and then the sending of those messages to spirits?

268
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,480
Can you just give us kind of the full picture?

269
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,520
Okay, so this is quite a subtle point, so it takes a bit of explaining.

270
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,320
So first of all, what is the relationship between evoking a spirit and using cryptography?

271
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,400
And there is a relationship, so that some grimoires suggest that the

272
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,360
evocation should be encrypted, or the name of the spirit should be encrypted, etc.

273
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,360
And that always sounded a bit weird to me.

274
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,640
But then if you think about what Aston Aston and Spare was doing, he was taking

275
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:22,360
the magical result that he desired written in English, and then he was

276
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,200
using cryptography or his own version of cryptography to produce something

277
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,880
which doesn't mean anything, a series of letters and things.

278
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:41,800
So he was also using cryptography before calling for the spirit.

279
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,520
And one of the things there is, of course, you ask the question, what languages

280
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,760
do spirits speak?

281
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,880
And in the Middle Ages, they would have been assumed to speak Latin and possibly Greek,

282
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,560
which was good because everybody in those days spoke Latin, not the case anymore.

283
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:13,400
And therefore, what you needed was to focus on the outcome that you're looking for,

284
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,760
or the name of the spirit.

285
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:21,440
And one of the practices is you could encrypt it, because when you encrypt

286
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,280
something, you have to think about it a lot.

287
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:34,360
And so this, as it were, underlined the desired results, and it got through to the spirit.

288
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Whereas if you just stand in the middle of the room and quickly read off something you

289
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,880
wrote 10 minutes ago, this doesn't have the same impact.

290
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,280
So it's increasing the impact by encrypting.

291
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,160
Now, sending messages via spirits is a different thing.

292
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,720
But you can still use cryptography to stress it.

293
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,600
So let's stand back from there.

294
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:10,920
What Christos Emius was aiming at was the 1500s version of email.

295
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,440
He wanted to be able to send messages to monks who knew about magic in other monasteries

296
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,200
on the other side of Germany or Czechoslovakia or in Italy or whatever.

297
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:32,080
He didn't very sadly have email, but he figured, and it is true, that he could use

298
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,840
spirits to take the message.

299
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,880
So you give the message to a spirit.

300
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,320
You first of all, you've got to call the spirit properly.

301
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:45,240
Give the message, the spirit, and tell the spirit to deliver it to Mr.

302
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,400
Orwellis in Prague or something.

303
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,120
And the spirit will do that.

304
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,640
But the problem with the message is when he gets there, the recipient will not either

305
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,240
understand the message or understand that something has been sent to him.

306
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,360
So it had to be with somebody who also understood the magic, who knew what the

307
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,440
invocation was to material, not materialize, but to consolidate the spirit and to

308
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,240
get the message.

309
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,120
So it's kind of a complicated procedure, just like with email.

310
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:27,880
You need machinery at one end to encrypt the message into electrical pulses.

311
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,960
And then you need machinery at the other end to unencrypted, as it were, into a piece

312
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,000
of sensible English.

313
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,320
Dr. Skinner, where have you practiced this?

314
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,040
Have you engaged with the steganographia?

315
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,160
Yes, I have experimented.

316
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:50,280
And I have to say that unless the recipient is well trained, well versed in the

317
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,880
method, it's quite difficult.

318
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:00,240
And so I found that sometimes I can simply send the message so that the person dreams

319
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,160
about it rather than the spirit actually explaining it.

320
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,440
But then I thought, well, I don't look going to waste much more time on this

321
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,000
because email is much, much more efficient and much, much more accurate.

322
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,240
But there's a 500 year gap between one method and the other.

323
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,480
So although the objective of a lot of the steganographia is to send spirit

324
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,920
carried messages, there is other stuff in there that's of use to people who are

325
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,040
interested in magic.

326
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,960
Dr. Skinner, as well, something that ties into what you just shared is people

327
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,800
have been wondering for centuries if the steganographia is a book about encoding

328
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,280
messages or summoning spirits.

329
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,200
You just added a bunch of excellent context there.

330
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,240
And to that point, we have a few listener questions for you from Glitchbottle

331
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,560
patron Anna Maddalena.

332
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,440
And Anna is asking her first question is, I'm very eager to know what details you

333
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,800
have culled from the steganographia, Dr. Skinner.

334
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,800
Well, one of the details that I found most interesting is that the steganographia

335
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,320
has across two of its books, two complete spirit registers.

336
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,720
Now, a spirit register will be familiar to anybody who's read the Goetia.

337
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,920
It's a list of spirits with details about what their offices are.

338
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,760
In other words, what it is they're capable of doing and sometimes their schedule.

339
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,680
So that was the first thing.

340
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:49,240
But in the steganographia, every spirit has its own private invocation, which is

341
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,880
very rare, probably completely unique, because the usual procedure is you have

342
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,640
a standard evocation into which you insert the spirit's name.

343
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:06,000
But this is somewhat more powerful because you are using an evocation in a

344
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,520
language which I'm not going to specify, but one not very commonly known to call

345
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,400
that spirit and that spirit should get the message a lot easier.

346
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:27,000
Talking about that, somebody once asked me, what senses do spirits have?

347
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,880
Well, I can tell you that they can hear even at, well, is it a remarkable

348
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,000
distance or are they in fact very close, but in another dimension, but they can

349
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,440
certainly hear and the spirit will recognize its own name, even if you

350
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,800
mispronounce it a little bit.

351
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,920
The other thing they can do is they can smell because the choice of

352
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,400
incenses is critical for magic.

353
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,000
You have different incenses for different planetary spirits, for example.

354
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,480
And spirits actually are attracted by beautiful smelling atmosphere.

355
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,280
So when you say that the spirit is invoked, you can make things convenient

356
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,680
for him by burning or vaporizing a smell that he likes.

357
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,400
So I can say that spirits have a sense of hearing, a sense of smell.

358
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,800
I can also say that their sight is not that clear because I've done certain

359
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,040
experiments and I'll just leave it at that, that they're not very clear with

360
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,560
sight, maybe it's the difference of working across two different worlds.

361
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,720
But given those two things, the sense of smell is the hint why

362
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:02,320
magicians have to bath or clear themselves immediately before an

363
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,880
operation because they do not like the smell of human beings.

364
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,680
And so in fact, some magicians recommended that you actually

365
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:19,440
study yourself with some sweet smelling incense or whatever and that works quite well.

366
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,000
Dr. Skinner as well, this just popped into my head.

367
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,400
So let me just let me just ask you between Anna's questions.

368
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,960
But in another one of your tomes, I feel like I'm pulling every book off

369
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,400
of my bookshelf here and the nine Rudian provocations.

370
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,920
The Solomonic Archangels and Demon Princes, one of the pieces of advice

371
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,440
that is given is to never.

372
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,600
It's one of the beneficial aphorisms says never mix experiments.

373
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,480
So you either focus on more celestial operations or more sublunar,

374
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,360
if you will, slash catholic operations for these spirits.

375
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,720
Would you classify the spirits and the Stegonographia as angelic or in the

376
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,280
Theurgia, Goetia, they seem to be these aerial spirits, these dukes that can wander.

377
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,240
Can you share a little bit about that?

378
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,960
They're actually sublunar spirits or aerial spirits.

379
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,560
So they can float around in the atmosphere.

380
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,320
If you get them to materialize, then they will be just floating around

381
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,880
rather than standing on the floor or anything like that.

382
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,800
Subluna is a nice word, anything under the moon,

383
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,120
but it excludes sonic or subterranean spirits,

384
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,160
which are a completely different sort of animal.

385
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,360
Excellent. Thank you, Dr. Skinner.

386
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,920
I know myself and I'm sure the listeners really appreciate that.

387
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,640
Back to Anna's question and his next question.

388
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,040
We broke these up a little bit and is asking and commenting, Dr.

389
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,640
Skinner, that it always struck me as strange that important state secrets

390
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,520
would be encoded by lists of spirit names.

391
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,640
Can you comment on this a little bit?

392
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,560
Yeah, the messages are not encoded by the spirit names.

393
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,960
The spirit names are actually labels for particular encoding messages.

394
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,400
So if it was, say, parmesiel,

395
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,200
this is a particular encoding procedure.

396
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,360
So then they're labels and you could have used animal names.

397
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,920
It could have been the giraffe encoding and the rhinoceros encoding.

398
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,120
But Trasimus has used spirit names,

399
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,640
which is confused a lot of people because they are trying to see some connection

400
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:45,080
between the encoding and the magic, which I've vaguely explained already.

401
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,240
To Anna's next question, Anna is asking, in particular, Dr. Skinner,

402
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,280
I'm wondering if you agree that the occult aspect of the text

403
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,400
is merely a blind for the deeper cryptographic work

404
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:03,120
or if it has a double valency as both a code book and an esoteric tone?

405
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:11,240
Well, it does have a double valency and Trasimus must have been a fantastically

406
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,960
bright guy because he's managed to work both things into the text.

407
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,160
But the cryptography gives him deniability.

408
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,440
If he's brought up before a body of his peers or the inquisition,

409
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,840
he can say, no, you stupid people, you can see it's about cryptography.

410
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,000
And I've just used magic to frighten people away from it

411
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,320
because he knows he can't be done for cryptography.

412
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,200
It's not a crime.

413
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:47,080
However, evoking spirits might very well be a theological crime.

414
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:53,560
So when he's got that deniability, it's achieved itself.

415
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:59,880
But his cryptography is also there and it's not the most efficient cryptography.

416
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,320
So you might need 100 words to just make a very short message.

417
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,240
And there are much better ways of making short messages cryptographically

418
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,080
rather than wasting so many words.

419
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,480
But what do I know about cryptography?

420
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,080
Quite a lot, quite a lot.

421
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,520
And so it seems, Dr. Skinner, that Anna's saying exactly what you just commented on,

422
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,800
which is in some places in Europe, possessing such a book of necromantic names,

423
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,640
those demonic names could get you in as much trouble or more trouble

424
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,760
as passing along state secrets, it seems.

425
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,680
Yeah, absolutely.

426
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:48,920
I mean, state secrets, well, for example, D was an intelligence for Elizabeth I.

427
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,360
But I'm sure a lot of the stuff that he was sending back to England

428
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,640
wouldn't have got him into trouble.

429
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:04,760
But having been convicted of evoking evil spirits from the church's point of view,

430
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,320
that would have definitely got him into trouble.

431
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,640
So the necromantic names are much more dangerous than passing on secret information.

432
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,080
One of your primary areas of focus, Dr. Skinner, and it's even in the name of one of your books,

433
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,400
is the techniques, the technological application.

434
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,000
And you mentioned, along with David Rankin in the Goetia of Dr. Rudd, a wonderful tome,

435
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,400
that, quote, the same tables used to encrypt also produced the spirit names, end quote.

436
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,040
So roughly, Dr. Skinner, can you share with listeners who might be hearing about this

437
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,320
for the first time?

438
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,480
How does this whole process work?

439
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,840
Is the practitioner supposed to derive the spirit names first and then encrypt

440
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,280
a message for the spirit?

441
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,400
How does all that work?

442
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,280
No, it's two separate processes.

443
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,080
So you can generate spirit names by using tables of Hebrew letters,

444
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:10,360
using a sigil to tell you which cell in the table you go to from which cell and on to which cell

445
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:19,240
you spell out a name, or even the reverse process, you spell the name onto the table

446
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,920
and that gives you the spirit sigil.

447
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,040
Because the ingredients that you need for an evocation are the name of the spirit,

448
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:33,000
the sigil of the spirit, and then you need to calculate what's the best time to call them,

449
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,880
et cetera, et cetera.

450
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,960
That's using tables to produce the name of spirits or to check the sigil or to reverse

451
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:47,960
that, but it's not the whole process.

452
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,680
Encrypting the message for the spirit is a separate process.

453
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,600
So you know the spirit name, you call the spirit, you tell the spirit your message in

454
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,920
whatever form, whatever language, whatever cryptographic form, and then he will convey

455
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:14,280
that more or less accurately, and I can't swear always accurately, to the distant friend or

456
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:21,960
who is similarly aware of this magical technique, and then he will say the necessary words,

457
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,840
and more often than not, the message will come to him and dream.

458
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:35,800
The trisimus says the spirit will whisper it in his ear, but my experience is that

459
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,080
doesn't always happen.

460
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,560
It's more likely to turn up in the dream on the following night.

461
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,760
Reminds me, Dr. Skinner, of something you touched on before.

462
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:52,200
There's a, I believe in the PGM, there's a spell that says that you can have a message

463
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:59,320
and the deity will appear in someone else's dream as the God that they believe in,

464
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,760
as opposed to what you believe in.

465
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,440
That's a very sneaky piece of magic.

466
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:13,640
I do know the method for inserting thoughts into other people's dreams in such a way that

467
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,880
they will believe it's their own thought, because you wake up in the morning and not all the thoughts

468
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:28,600
in your head do you immediately recognize, but a much more effective way is to have

469
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:34,680
in that person's dream a figure who is their God appear to them and tell them,

470
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,160
you must do this, you must do that, and then they can go, oh my God told you.

471
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,760
If it's a Catholic, it may be a saint.

472
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:52,600
If it's a pagan, then it may be a pagan God, but to incorporate that God into the

473
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,120
delivery of the message makes it very highly effective.

474
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,800
As well, Dr. Skinner, I think this next part touches on something that you brought up at

475
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,600
the beginning of our chat and also something David Rankin talks about when he, in his

476
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,920
Grimoire Encyclopedia, when he talks about the building of magical momentum or magical tension

477
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:20,600
and you say, quote, that the mental effort involved in encoding the message to the spirit

478
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,480
is part of the magical procedure, end quote. Can you share why is this so important, Dr. Skinner?

479
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,960
Well, most people take a very casual attitude to magic. I'll just quickly

480
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,160
rattle through the invocation and then I'll tell the spirit what I want. No, you have to use

481
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,840
a lot of, I wouldn't say brain power, but a lot of intention.

482
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:52,120
People will say that magic is mostly psychological. I definitely don't believe that,

483
00:39:52,760 --> 00:40:01,560
but I know that when you do it, it must be done with intention and carefully and precisely,

484
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,520
which is why three of my books start with the word techniques of.

485
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:17,560
Technique comes from a Greek word, which means a craft or a procedure. I like to think of

486
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:25,080
magic as something that is done scientifically, but only scientifically in the sense of

487
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:33,080
method. So you try something out, you record your results, you formulate series and that,

488
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,880
and then you test the series. Well, it's not quite as complicated as that in magic,

489
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,360
because a lot of the instructions are already available in the grimoires,

490
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:51,560
and so you use them, but you use them carefully and with attention. Just as if you were driving or

491
00:40:51,560 --> 00:41:00,360
flying a rapid plane, you need attention and intention, otherwise you might come to a nasty,

492
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:07,960
nasty sticky end. Yes, so you would consider Dr. Skinner this mental technique, this preparation

493
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,480
of encoding the message as just as important as, say, gathering your materia magica, your wand,

494
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,880
your sword, consecrating things. It sounds like it's that important to the technique.

495
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,400
Yeah, yeah, and producing your ray of tools and people say to me, well, why do you need

496
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:30,120
tools for magic? Why can't you just sit in your arm chair and think about it? That does not work,

497
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:38,280
but at least it doesn't work for me. There may be people who can do that, but not anybody I

498
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:46,600
immediately know. And you see the same thing in Chinese magic or even martial arts. I mean,

499
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,240
there's a well-known story of a village which was being attacked by some raiders,

500
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:06,120
and one of the team masters there tried to contract a samurai to teach them how to fight with

501
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:12,840
swords and fight these people off who are destined to arrive in the next week or something. And of

502
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:18,440
course, the master said, you've got to be kidding. I can't teach you what you need to know in a week.

503
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,080
Tell me what you do know. And he said, well, I know how to do the tea ceremony. And I do that

504
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:35,240
with a lot of attention. And I do that regularly. And I'm really a master of that. So the samurai

505
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:42,120
simply taught him how to clean the sword and replace it in a scabbard and told him to apply

506
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:49,960
the same degree of intention to that as he did to the tea ceremony. So when the raiders turned up,

507
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,800
there was the team master pretending to be head of the village,

508
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:04,040
and laid out in front of him was one or two pieces of equipment. And he cleaned them and

509
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,760
presented them in the way that he would have done for the tea ceremony. And the raiders looked and

510
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:14,680
they saw this guy treats his tools like this. He obviously knows what he's doing.

511
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:24,600
We'll go and find an easier village to raid and they left. So the point of that slightly oblique

512
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:32,360
story is that the weapons and they are called weapons of magical practice need to be treated

513
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:40,680
great deal of respect and intention. And they need to be exercised and consecrated.

514
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:49,400
And these actions then give them much more than psychological power, but it does give them

515
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,520
power that then can work. And the spirits can appreciate that. They look at a magician who

516
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:03,880
lays out his tools properly, leans them, wraps them in the right colored silk and so forth. And

517
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,640
they figure, this guy knows what he's doing. We better not mess with him.

518
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:18,360
People find it hard to understand when I explain it. But I think the Chinese team master

519
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,000
is a good parallel. Absolutely. One of the ways I've phrased it is,

520
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,480
based on everything that you've shared and Fraterashin Shasan and other guests is,

521
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:34,280
instead of operating on the laws of physics, many grimoire interactions and evocatory procedures

522
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:41,160
operate on the laws of meaning and intention and being able to meet them in a specific laid-down

523
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,200
pre-mutually agreed upon terms and a specific ritualistic structure that gets results. I don't

524
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:54,360
know if that's a fair way to think about it. And going back to previous conversation we had a few

525
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:05,000
minutes ago, in the Greek magical papyri and in the old Egyptian temples, anybody who had just

526
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,080
eaten garlic or fish was not allowed to come in and was certainly discouraged from doing any ritual

527
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:18,280
or worship or ritual inside the temple because the spirits do have a great sense of smell.

528
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,920
So the spirits can cotton on to what we're doing, that we're doing the right technique

529
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:33,720
and that we are masters of what we are doing. And that instills a certain amount of fear and

530
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:39,240
obedience. Dr. Skinner, in addition to those vital elements, one of the things that you mentioned

531
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:45,400
that's necessary for the successful completion of an evocatory procedure in the grimoire tradition

532
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:52,840
is the seal, the sigil of the spirit. And to that very point, the very few number of seals

533
00:45:52,840 --> 00:46:00,120
found in the Stegonographia match exactly to the seals found in the second book of the Lamegaten,

534
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:07,160
namely the Theurgia Goetia. So can you share, Dr. Skinner, why doesn't the Stegonographia contain

535
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:14,600
more of these seals? Right. So as I've already explained, to call the spirit, you need its seal

536
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,360
so that it's not sufficient to have the Stegonographia. You've got the evocations,

537
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:26,680
you've got the spirits' names, you've got the times, etc. But when Trasimius is writing that,

538
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:33,080
he also composed the Theurgia Goetia, Don't Be Distracted by the Name,

539
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:40,840
which I think is a later edition. And in that, he had the same spirits, but he had their seals.

540
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:48,440
And he knew, being a sensible lad, that you should keep these two elements separate. However,

541
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,200
if you're a practicing magician, then you need to bring these two elements together,

542
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,280
and you use the seals in the Theurgia Goetia, which you've got the same spirit names as the

543
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:04,760
invocations, etc. in the Stegonographia. So I suppose this is a little plug for,

544
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:14,040
yes, if you're going to do this, you also need to buy Dr. Rudd's Goetia, because in there will be

545
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:21,720
the seals that you need. I see that Alex is waving it around. Thank you very much. And that's another

546
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:29,880
coincidence. It's part of my progress through the Grimoires to cover, hopefully, all the bases

547
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:39,800
by the end of my time. I think historically, the Theurgia Goetia was made at the same time

548
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:47,560
by Trasimius and kept separate. And its path as a manuscript has been different from the Stegonographia.

549
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:54,200
But you can now, because they're both in English and they're both published by me,

550
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,360
you can bring them together and make it work.

551
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:03,720
It's a truly very, very valuable resource for people who want to read about it, for people who

552
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:09,640
want to practice this. I'm certainly looking forward to it, Dr. Skinner. And just as a brief

553
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:15,720
follow-up question, do you think the author of the Theurgia Goetia used tables to derive

554
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,920
the numerous seals just as a follow-up to that?

555
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:28,760
No. You don't use tables to derive the seals. This is a technical area I don't want to get into,

556
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:34,280
but they were derived at the same time, I think, and then put in a separate manuscript.

557
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,360
Of course, Trasimius, being the abbot, had all these monks in his scriptorium who would write

558
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,320
stuff for him. So this is something I would have loved to have myself,

559
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,480
instead of having to type it. I'm one finger typist, and I just type with one finger,

560
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:59,960
and it's not nearly as fast as being able to hand some rough copy to a monk and say,

561
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:08,440
go off and inscribe that on parchment or whatever, such luxury. But on the other hand,

562
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:16,520
I don't have the inquisition looking over my shoulder or what was left of the English laws

563
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:24,520
against magic, which I think they abolished in 1951, which is a bit late, but at least they've gone.

564
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,040
So it's a trade-off. So I'm happy.

565
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,160
Yes, those are powerful, motivating forces. And as a fellow one-finger type, or I certainly

566
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,200
sympathize, Dr. Skinner, fully, fully, absolutely.

567
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:47,160
My mother said, I said, I need to learn to type because I'm going to produce a few, more than

568
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:52,600
a few words. And she said, no, you don't. You'll always have a secretary. Your father had a secretary.

569
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,480
You'll have a secretary. You don't need to learn it. And then she was wrong.

570
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:03,000
It's like, right. In addition to being the scholar and translating things and pouring

571
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,520
over manuscripts and the welcome library, in addition to all of that, you also are then typing

572
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:16,280
through everything, of course. Yes. I've tried one little program where you speak,

573
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,640
and it types it up for you on the screen. But it always gets the technical words wrong.

574
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,440
And so you've got to go back and retype. And in the end, I've timed myself. It's almost

575
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:32,360
just as fast to type it yourself. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. It would be very hard to tell

576
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:37,880
Microsoft Word or something to, you know, Bane Chuch or Adonai Shaddai El Chai, you know,

577
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,680
it might, it might not get all the, all of the letters correct. Yeah. So you got to,

578
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,200
you got to go back and rework and see, might as well type it in the first place.

579
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:54,120
Right. Absolutely. That's just my problem, not anybody else's. Earlier, I asked you if you

580
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:01,240
practiced the steganography and you shared your answer. But just as a follow-up, since you publicly

581
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,680
shared about experimenting with the LeMegatins Goatia, as you've shared, and also the Arsonatoria,

582
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:13,080
have you experimented with the Theurgia Goatia? Or, or is there anything else you'd like to

583
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,120
touch on about experimenting with either the steganography or the Theurgia Goatia?

584
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:25,560
Yes, I have. But because to actually do it right with the steganography, I need to

585
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:31,320
re-import the sigils. And I thought when I produced this edition, maybe I should sneak

586
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:37,640
the sigils back in, but that's not, it's not academically acceptable to do that. So you still

587
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:44,120
got to put two books next to each other and, and work on it from there. I'm still working my way

588
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:52,120
through the, what was it, 56, 57 spirits. There's some I'm just never going to get around to, but

589
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,200
I've worked my way through handfuls of the more interesting ones.

590
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:02,200
You were talking about the samurai story earlier, one of your magical colleagues and one of our

591
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,640
magical friends, Frater Ashen Chassan, an excellent grimoire, a traditionalist and practitioner.

592
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,320
He has a question for you, Dr. Skinner, saying, Dr. Skinner, can you please share about how

593
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,160
the angels, or if the angels, inspired the techniques or the technology for the ciphers

594
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:24,680
themselves, what are your thoughts on the angelic involvement in imparting the knowledge for coded

595
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:32,280
information found in the steganographia? I don't think the angels taught Trasimius

596
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:41,800
cryptography. For a start, a lot of Trasimius' cryptography is very, very stalled at having

597
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:51,160
to translate a large, as I said before, say 100 words into a five-word message or something.

598
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:57,800
It's just not practical. So I don't think they did. I think that you've got to give

599
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:04,440
Trasimius' brain the credit for the cryptography. Thank you for that additional context, Dr. Skinner.

600
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:10,120
And speaking of other guests who have been on the podcast, we have a listener question for you

601
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:17,480
from Mihai Vartajaru, who is asking and saying, Dr. Skinner, are the 31 spirits listed in the

602
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:23,480
steganographia actual spirits that may be contacted, or are the spirit names just an

603
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,800
ideal spirit catalog devised by Trasimius as an example of his cryptographical method?

604
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:39,080
Well, I've sort of answered that already. I can see that Mihai is working from old English

605
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:46,200
translations, or even from the Latin, because he only mentions what was it, 31 spirits.

606
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:52,360
Whereas, in fact, when you add in the second volume, you add another 25.

607
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:02,120
No, the spirit names are real. They do come to you. They will come. And they will do work for

608
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:09,800
you if you approach it in the right way. They're not just empty counters for his cryptography.

609
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:17,480
Now, I admit that my bias is biting in here that I'm not interested in cryptography because

610
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:29,480
there are now programs like some of the cyber currency things with passwords which are, I don't

611
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:35,880
know, 56 letters long or something, which do cryptography well above anything that

612
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:45,320
Trasimius could have done. But his magic still works. But his cryptography is still a bit slow.

613
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:52,040
I don't think the angels provided it to him. If they had, it might have been a little bit more

614
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:58,040
efficient. Yes, that's one of the things, among many, that I'm so thankful for is your insistence,

615
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,280
Dr. Skinner, on practicality. I remember in a previous interview, you said that,

616
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,600
and I'm inserting the word tortured here, but you even tortured yourself learning Demotic Greek,

617
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:13,400
not for liturgical or the appreciation of history for practical use. So, you go to very

618
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:22,600
far lengths to have a practical effect on the results of magic. Yes, learning Greek was just

619
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:32,360
so much pain, but what worth doing. Absolutely. And you've touched on a few figures here,

620
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:37,560
Dr. Skinner, historical figures and researchers, practitioners. We have a follow-up question

621
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:44,440
for you from Mihai Vartajaru, who is asking, is Dr. Skinner aware of the 20th century Romanian

622
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:51,640
historian, Ioan Petruculiano, who attempted to decipher Trasimius's cryptographic code?

623
00:55:53,480 --> 00:56:01,560
Yes, I'm very aware of Culiano. He's one of the academics who have actually done practical magic,

624
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:09,160
which means that his other academic colleagues were a little bit wary of him,

625
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:14,600
because he's not around anymore. And he left Romania and went across the States,

626
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:21,400
where he finally worked at the University of Chicago. But terrible things happened to him.

627
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:29,720
He was actually assassinated in the toilet block of the Divinity School of the University of

628
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:38,440
Chicago. Now, why he was assassinated, I think, in my opinion, is because he kept

629
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:46,120
abusing the post-Chachescu communist regime and saying bad things about them.

630
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:53,880
He was certainly disliked by Chachescu. I have another story about Chachescu,

631
00:56:53,880 --> 00:57:02,600
which I probably shouldn't tell. But getting back to Mihai's question, yes,

632
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:11,080
Culiano's book, Eros and Magic in the Renaissance is full of useful stuff. It's not

633
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:17,640
greatly arranged. You don't go easily from one topic to another. But there are lots of gems

634
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:24,840
scattered throughout that book. Shall I tell my Chachescu story? I've been wanting to ask you,

635
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:32,600
yes, because you've teased it out so well. So please, sir. Okay. I worked for a publishing company,

636
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:40,440
which was owned by Robert Maxwell. And Robert Maxwell knew Chachescu, because he was involved

637
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:48,200
with a lot of Eastern European regimes. He also knew Brezhnev. He used to go drinking with him,

638
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,760
which must have been quite the effort, because Brezhnev could really hold his booze.

639
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:02,120
Anyway, in conversation, Chachescu asked Maxwell once, well, you know, I've got a bit of a bad

640
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:09,880
image, certainly a very bad image, because he was doing lots of bad things. How do I clean

641
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:17,880
my image up? And they came up with the idea, well, we should write a sort of vaguely sterilized

642
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:26,920
biography saying all the great things you did. Of course, then it was up to Chachescu to think of

643
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:35,000
some of the great things that he'd done, apart from demolishing about a quarter of his capital city

644
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:41,400
to build one of the largest palaces ever seen. And he must have used an enormous amount of the

645
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:51,080
country's wealth to do that. But that's another issue. Anyway, I'll not get too personal about

646
00:58:51,080 --> 00:59:02,200
this, but Maxwell hired with a bit of advice, somebody to write this book. And Chachescu provided

647
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:09,800
tons and tons of information. Most of it had to be adjusted to make it sound good.

648
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:21,000
And the book was written. And because I was involved, the book was printed. And I can't

649
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,400
remember how many copies. It wasn't a lot of copies, because Maxwell didn't think it was

650
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:31,640
still very well. But he needed to send 20 or 40 copies to Chachescu to show that he kept his

651
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:39,880
side of the deal. Let me think, that must have been round about Christmas 1989,

652
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:48,600
because I was working in publishing back in those days. And just as it was about to be launched,

653
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:59,480
Chachescu was tried very quickly in one evening, taken out of the back and shot along with his wife

654
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:07,240
so that the opposition forces then took over Romania. And we were left with the

655
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:15,560
warehouse full of this made-up story about Chachescu. So I got an urgent message from Maxwell,

656
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:23,960
destroy it, destroy it. And I did. I kept two copies, which must rank amongst the

657
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:29,720
rarest copies in the world. And the rest went off. I can't remember whether it was

658
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,840
burning or shredding, but it was definitely completely destroyed.

659
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,280
Just as a quick aside, you've had so many

660
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,160
involvements and fingerprints with other publications. For instance, I'm thinking of

661
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:46,520
the wonderful Black Easter novel with with Blish and the conversations that you've had.

662
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:52,680
I'm thinking of that humorous yet very teachable story at university about Alice Bailey and this

663
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:59,640
person dropping off a truckload of books of Alice Bailey, too. So it seems like you're right that

664
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:05,960
in this case, I mean, this was a very intense personal involvement and literally being told

665
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:11,240
to destroy those books. I mean, wow, yeah. Someday actually had to do the dirty work of

666
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:19,640
destroying them. But the command came down from Maxwell, who I, because I was on his

667
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:28,520
magazine publishing site, I saw fairly frequently. But that's that's stories for another day.

668
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:35,160
Given all this, Dr. Skinner, did Culliano deal with Trithemius's system and offered the first

669
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:40,120
version of an invocation of a spirit prince in his book about magic in the Renaissance?

670
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,960
Well, I have to correct that and say it wasn't the first

671
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:50,360
version of an invocation of a spirit prince because a lot of grimoires have been concerned with that

672
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:57,960
over the over the period, because spirits are quite hierarchical, or at least the way we understand

673
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:04,920
them is hierarchical. So they have princes and dukes, etc., which is mainly perhaps a reflection

674
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:10,600
of the way society was structured in the Middle Ages, where it could be actually some real

675
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:17,880
structuring. Culliano's story was not the first, but it was probably the first time

676
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:25,640
a professional academic had had explained that. Culliano used to make an offer to his

677
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:36,520
senior PhD students that they could learn magic with him, but only on condition that they did

678
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:42,600
each of the experiments as was taught by him. So he had a limited number of takers on that,

679
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:49,720
but he did actually teach practical magic to some of his students. All I can say is lucky them.

680
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:56,200
When I was at university, I didn't get any offer like that and had to fight my own ways

681
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:02,440
through the sources to find out how it works. You know, when it comes to technique and the

682
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,760
important elements of magic, you've been tracing this out for years, you've been connecting the

683
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:12,680
various techniques over, you know, thousands of years, and you and David Rankin in your

684
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:19,240
excellent collaborations, you mentioned that for a system like the Theurgia Goetia, that of course

685
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:25,560
is heavily dependent on the steganographia, that three elements are needed, the encoding of the

686
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:31,800
message, facing the correct direction, and the proper time of the day or the night. So

687
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,800
broadly speaking, do you feel, Dr. Skinner, that all three of these elements are vital to all

688
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:46,520
grimoireic operations and all grimoireic work? Yeah, basically, yes, but particularly time and

689
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:54,120
direction, because it's one thing that the spirits understand and we understand. And

690
01:03:54,200 --> 01:04:00,760
regards to timing, although some of the times listed in The Goetia,

691
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:08,200
which relate to the titles of the spirits, don't actually work that well.

692
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:16,920
But timing that relates to the planetary hours and the planetary days, that works very well.

693
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:27,560
And people ask me, well, why should calling a spirit at 8am on a Wednesday, a mercurial spirit,

694
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:34,600
work better than calling it when it's convenient for me at 6pm on Thursday?

695
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:44,280
And my answer to that is, well, if you want to talk to your doctor and you turn up this surgery at

696
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:55,560
3am on Sunday night, do you think you're going to get any help at all? And the answer is that spirits

697
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:05,160
do have, what do you call it, not a schedule, not a thing, but there are times when it's good

698
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:12,440
to try and talk to them and there's times when it's not good. You wouldn't invoke a spirit of

699
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:21,640
Venus in a Saturnian hour on a Saturday, because you're stacking it against yourself if your

700
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:29,880
invocation is very powerful, maybe. But why make life difficult? And so timing is very important.

701
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:36,760
The other thing about direction, well, as you can see from one of the illustrations that I showed

702
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:46,280
earlier, the spirits have specific directions. And if you wanted to talk to somebody and you

703
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:52,520
walked into their room and you turned your back to them whilst trying to convince them to do something,

704
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:57,560
they're going to think that's very rude and they're just not going to be helpful.

705
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,600
Now, spirits may not think you're very rude. They may think you're a little bit stupid because

706
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:09,000
you don't know the correct direction. But I think that, well, I know that invocations,

707
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,720
when invocations, which are done facing the correct direction work much, much better.

708
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:24,440
So that's time and direction. This bears on the steganographia because the first two books have

709
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:31,400
got the spirit lists in them. One of the books deals only with direction, which is the first

710
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:40,680
book. And the second book deals only with time, which is the planetary hours, etc. So there you

711
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:46,520
are. It's very clear that two different sets of directions. I find in practice, if you get them

712
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:58,840
both right, then that's even better. The question of cryptographic things is not so important.

713
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:05,400
Cryptographic is a bit important in steganographia, but there's a lot of magic where cryptography or

714
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:13,080
messing up the words in the way that AI is spare dead is not so important, but time and

715
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:20,200
direction are essential. Excellent. Thank you, Dr. Skinner. I know myself and I know the listeners

716
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:26,200
always appreciate those vital reminders no matter what grimoire direction you are looking at

717
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:32,520
exploring. That's excellent. We also have a listener question for you, Dr. Skinner, a few from

718
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:38,680
Andrew Nichols. And Andrew is saying, in the first part of the question, we broke these up a

719
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:44,520
little bit, I'm not as familiar with Dr. Skinner's work as I hope to be one day. So forgive me if

720
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:49,560
this has already been covered in his work, but as someone living in Australia, I'm frequently

721
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:56,040
confronted by the northern hemisphere-centric nature of the majority of the esoteric and

722
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:02,280
goetic canon. As a fellow, Antipodian, who has spent at least some of his career based south of

723
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:07,960
the equator, I wonder if Dr. Skinner has any thoughts about how to navigate this.

724
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:16,120
Okay. Well, this is a very interesting question for me because it is applicable to magic, but it's

725
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:22,920
also applicable to my other great interest, which is classical Chinese Feng Shui. And I don't mean

726
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:29,800
simply moving your furniture around or painting a wall red or whatever else. I mean, the really

727
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:37,960
classical stuff which I have been interested in for a long time. And that question is asked, well,

728
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,680
if all these Feng Shui rules work for the northern hemisphere, what do we have to do in the southern

729
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:49,080
hemisphere? Should we flip them on their head? Because climatically, the warm bits are in the

730
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:56,120
north, as is the thing from in Europe, the warm bits are in the south. And the quick answer is no,

731
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:05,480
you shouldn't. Because although climatically, the two hemispheres are quite different. In fact,

732
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:12,840
in terms of direction, they're the same because east is the same direction in the northern hemisphere

733
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:19,560
as it is in the southern hemisphere. West is also the same direction. Even north and south

734
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:27,880
are the same direction. It doesn't all scramble as you go across the equator. And then further to that,

735
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:35,240
as I lived in Singapore for 14 years, Singapore is very close to the equator. You could almost

736
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:42,520
say it's on the equator. And I did not notice walking from one side of the island to the other any

737
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:52,760
difference. Nor did I notice anything in Indonesia south of the equator that's distinct from Singapore.

738
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:58,760
And so the short answer is no, you don't have to flip things either for feng shui or for magic.

739
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:06,840
So also for feng shui, it's much clearer because direction is a very big thing in feng shui.

740
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:17,480
It's also very important in magic. And no, you don't have to bend it around. Oh, the other thing,

741
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:27,880
I had a friend who said that if we're doing horoscopes, the seasons are different. So

742
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:37,880
you should flip the horoscopes as well. So I said, okay, give me a detailed analysis of myself.

743
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:43,320
And he produced something which was diametrically opposite to everything that I'm made up of.

744
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:52,680
And that killed it for me that no, you don't need to mess around like that. It's just

745
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,960
perfectly good to use the same rules in both atmospheres.

746
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:05,880
And this follows Dr. Skinner with materia magica, I would assume as well, because

747
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,160
Andrew is asking and saying, for example, does Dr. Skinner feel it would be more efficacious to

748
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:17,880
cheat quote unquote by buying a hazel wand online or to experiment with substituting

749
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:26,120
an Australian tree so that I can cut the branch myself? Okay, the essential thing is it should

750
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:33,240
be hazel, not that you should cut it yourself. If you've got the hazel and you've bought it

751
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:38,280
through Amazon and somebody else has cut it on the other side of the world, it doesn't matter.

752
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:46,440
You still have an hazel wand. And the spirits will know that if you turned up with a eucalyptus

753
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:53,320
wand waving it around, this is not hazel wand. And then they'll just ignore it.

754
01:11:55,080 --> 01:12:03,240
So you don't need to do a special change. And besides which, if you decided to just

755
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:07,480
select a different tree, you might have to go through 100 different varieties of tree before

756
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:15,800
you got one that was even halfway as good as hazel. So stick with the plan. Don't unnecessarily

757
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:27,320
mess it around. As Frida Ash and Jason once said, you still have to make changes on some of the

758
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:35,880
some of the magical procedures, but they're usually quite small and they're usually not

759
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:43,000
to make life more convenient for you so that you can have any old stick rather than a hazel wand.

760
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:51,480
Yes, it's about putting in putting in the work and putting in the effort. And I very much appreciate

761
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:57,160
Andrew's question and you sharing your expertise, Dr. Skinner, because those questions, I think

762
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:02,520
do come up when people wonder, especially in this global chipping world and everything else. So

763
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:08,760
that is lovely. And Andrew also has a final question as well, Dr. Skinner saying, okay,

764
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:16,520
while moving from hazel wands to say, with seasonal timings or the dates of pagan festivals that

765
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:21,640
align with the seasons, which I know is moving away somewhat from Dr. Skinner's area of expertise,

766
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:27,400
but he's mentioning as an example, can these Dr. Skinner be transferred south of the equator

767
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:35,560
wholesale or should they also be flipped? Okay, well, we'll start with saying not flipped, but

768
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:47,880
if it's a cultural thing, then maybe you do have to adhere to its site of origin. So for example,

769
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:53,720
I can tell you from practical experience that dealing with spirits like fairies

770
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:03,800
works quite efficiently in Wales or Scotland in Celtic areas. But trying to invoke those same

771
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:13,560
entities in Singapore does not work or it doesn't work for me anyway. So there is an element of

772
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:22,600
that, but you don't just flip it, you don't then say, well, we'll invoke a demon of some other source

773
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:31,640
simply because we're in the southern hemisphere. No. So you have to, for spirits, they are sometimes

774
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:38,680
located in particular areas and they will not happily go from there. Most demons however,

775
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:45,640
are available throughout the world. If they're called right, they will come because they're not

776
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:51,880
culturally embedded in one particular area or another. So following through on cultural embedding,

777
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:59,640
if you're trying to call an Australian Aboriginal spirit, you will not have much

778
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:07,880
of a chance outside of Australia or indeed outside of some of the more barren areas of Australia.

779
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:15,160
Which is the same thing as don't try calling fairies in Singapore.

780
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:23,640
Yes. And some of the spirits, as you so excellently delineated Dr. Skinner, for instance,

781
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:27,800
in the steganographia, these are sub-lunar spirits. These are not cathonic spirits,

782
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:33,240
but it sounds like it would be fair to say that spirits found in the steganographia,

783
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:39,800
the Lemegetans' Goat Asia, the Ariel Kings and the Heptameron, these are not spirits that are bound by

784
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:46,200
a specific section of the globe. These can be called pretty much no matter where you are if

785
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:51,960
you follow the appropriate method. Would that be somewhat fair? Yep. Yeah. That's definitely fair.

786
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:58,280
I picked two extreme examples which are very culturally connected to the Australian

787
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:05,560
aborigines and the fairies, but for most other spirits, they are available throughout the world.

788
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:11,160
Excellent. Well, Dr. Skinner, returning to this theme of techniques, for example,

789
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:17,480
I've seen this online and I'd just love to run this by you. You see this kind of

790
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:25,800
general misconception online that, and again, this is a false dichotomy and almost a caricature,

791
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:32,360
but some people might say, well, solematic magicians, they're purists who want to reduce

792
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:39,240
the grimoires to only cookie-cutter mathematical steps that are mechanical and repeatable,

793
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:43,720
and it's sterile. And when I'm online and I say I do the grimoire this way, I have a grimoire

794
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:49,880
or a purist saying, no, you need to do it this way. But to me, talking with you, Frater Ashton

795
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:57,480
I mean, so many practitioners, I get the opposite that this is very, very much based on

796
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:04,200
the methods, the scientific method, but it's also based on developing your own individual

797
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:09,960
relationships with spirits. So can you kind of share about this conception or misconception

798
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:15,560
that people might have, Dr. Skinner, about it only being a strictly mechanical process?

799
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:24,120
So there's several elements there. It is mechanical in the sense that you have to do

800
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:34,120
the right things to make it work. If you burn tar and stand on a beach without a circle or

801
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:41,320
something, it's not going to work. You have to do the right actions with the right tools in the right

802
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:53,960
place. But that's not cookie-cutter, is it? So don't confuse that with my own scientific approach

803
01:17:53,960 --> 01:18:02,840
to it. But with any technique, if you're a brain surgeon, you need to attack the right part of the

804
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:10,280
brain, not with a spoon and fork, but with the right equipment. And you need to do it at the right

805
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:18,120
time when the person is under anesthesia. Otherwise, you'll cause terrible problems.

806
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:27,960
So yes, you need to observe the rules. But that doesn't make you cookie-cutter. Magic is not

807
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:37,000
simple. You have to work at it quite hard. Ashton Chase initially did a number of operations

808
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:43,000
where people would have just given up, but he persisted and then he figured out what was the

809
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:50,920
small change that needed to be done to make it work right. Then the other thing is a lot of

810
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:59,000
people say that you need to create a special bond with the spirits. That is certainly true

811
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:08,680
if you're trying to create or encourage a familiar. But if you're just using, and I say

812
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:14,280
using, because I mean using, one spirit for one particular action and you may not call them again

813
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:21,640
for a long time, such bonds are not necessary. But the correct procedure is still necessary.

814
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:28,360
So would it be fair to say, Dr. Skinner, just to button up this topic, if someone's out there

815
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:32,440
listening, they love your books, they're reading about the Solomonic method, and if they're wondering,

816
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:39,240
well gosh, why is Dr. Skinner so focused on repeatability and the steps? I think it would be

817
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:45,480
fair to say that you can easily teach the steps, but it's not so easy with personal relationships

818
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:50,360
because those are so idiosyncratic. They're based on your unique interaction. Would that be fair?

819
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:57,080
That's absolutely true. Let me draw one more parallel, which I previously done.

820
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:06,840
Working with spirits, invoking them and training them, if you like, to answer and do the things you

821
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:13,720
want, is just like working with a, trying to domesticate a horse. If you get a wild horse,

822
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:19,880
there are several ways you can do it, you know, but you will certainly need to put a hold on.

823
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:27,400
You will certainly need to have them in an enclosed space. In this case, the horse needs to be kept

824
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:34,600
inside the railings of the park, unlike spirits which need to be kept outside the railings of

825
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:43,960
the magical circle. Then you can't just shout at them in English or Latin or Hebrew. You need to

826
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:55,240
actually use tools like sugar lumps, or if you're a harsh person, a whip, but you need to have these

827
01:20:55,240 --> 01:21:02,040
tools to domesticate a horse and you need to observe the same rules. There's a fast way to

828
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:08,840
domesticate a horse and a very slow way. If you make up your own way, it probably will take forever

829
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:14,680
and it won't succeed, but if you use the standard procedure, you will domesticate the horse and then

830
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:21,880
you will later ride it safely and you'll need to harness it unless you're very clever at bareback

831
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:29,400
riding. It's like any task, you need to do it the right way. You don't need to cookie cut it,

832
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:38,040
but you need to do a method which has been proved to work in the past so that that's all.

833
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:46,600
David Rankin in the Grimoire Encyclopedia mentions that in his decades of experience with, for

834
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:52,680
instance, the LeMegatinsk Oasia, and I'm probably paraphrasing or butchering this, but he effectively

835
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:59,720
said he didn't find he needed to use, in the goetic context, more of the putting the sigil

836
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:06,840
in the fire and burning specific foul-smelling things, but that over time using the barrel

837
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:13,720
and ensis conjuration, using certain aspects of the vinculum that he could get those results.

838
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,240
Does that kind of go to what you're saying about, hey, there are various techniques,

839
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:22,680
there are various paths, but the goal should always be to engage with the spirit so that it

840
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:28,360
is successfully called and bound? Yes. The procedure is that you should use,

841
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:37,800
first of all, as close as possible to the standard Grimoire procedure. It's only later when you can

842
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:44,520
do it and you can call the spirit and direct it two or three times, then you can ask it,

843
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:51,240
how would it be easier for me to call you if the spirit says, well, if you have a radish

844
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:56,840
present on the altar, then it will work much better. That's a bad example, but you will get

845
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:03,480
information from the spirit and then you can use it. As David has been working at this for a very

846
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:12,040
long time, he has modified stuff, but these people who start and decide immediately they want to

847
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:22,680
modify it, oh, I'll use a kitchen spoon rather than a wand and I'll do this and I'll do this.

848
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:28,600
This is not going to work and you're just hobbling your progress.

849
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:39,400
I should add that since my first evocations, I have now been doing magic for 60 years and

850
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:49,720
not that I'm 60, I'm somewhat older than 60. During that time, I have had to work really hard to

851
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:56,520
get the message to work for me, but once they're working for me, then I can make slight changes

852
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:04,440
in things and then it's repeatable. Because it's a technology, it is repeatable. You don't want to

853
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:11,880
have to climb the mountain every single time and you can come back and even shorten the technique,

854
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:17,320
but you've got to do it right first and have it succeed and then after that you can think about

855
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:24,680
what you might like to change. I can't hack it with pupils who want to change everything to start

856
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,240
with. I want to do it in the weekend and I want to do it without the right tools and I'll use

857
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:39,240
my brain and none of that works. Right, exactly. Just substituting Thor for every reference to

858
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:45,720
Adonai in the Hepatameron would not be a good first step in the ritual. I think that's safe to

859
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:53,640
say, yes. Absolutely. Okay. Well, thank you, Dr. Skitter. So listeners, we just have a few more

860
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:58,360
questions for Dr. Skitter and a very brief aftershow about some interesting points about

861
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:04,520
consecration. But before we get there, listeners, I just want to remind you, please check the podcast

862
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:12,200
and video descriptions to click on the link to pre-order your copy of Dr. Steven Skitter and

863
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:19,640
Daniel Clark's steganographia. The links will be below. But Dr. Skitter, just as we get ready to

864
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:23,960
wrap up the main part of the podcast, you're always working on something. I remember you said

865
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,600
that you have a list in front of you of many different projects and as you go through, you pick

866
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:34,200
and cross some of them off. So can you give us any hints about what other projects you are working on

867
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:44,680
right now? Yeah, this is my latest project. You only get a quick look at that and you can see my

868
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:57,080
penciling on the Latin. And it's another book by Etrusemius. And it's to do with the origin of

869
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:05,560
many of the grimoires. And so it is faintly complementary to David Rankine's fantastic

870
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:12,680
grimoire encyclopedia, for which there's no replacement at all. This is merely a supplement

871
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:21,000
that which I hope people will like. And that project is 85% finished,

872
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:25,720
but it will take a while before it finishes up on bookshelves.

873
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:33,880
Excellent, Dr. Skitter. I know myself and I know the thousands of listeners are very... We'll keep

874
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:39,240
our ear to the ground on that, as always. Can you tell us, Dr. Skitter? Of course, listeners can

875
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:46,520
click the links below and pre-order their copy of the book. And how else can they support you? How

876
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:51,880
can they check out your other works? Obviously, I'm thinking of Golden Horde Press, but anything

877
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:58,280
else you'd like to share with listeners, how they can best support you? Well, I'm always interested

878
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:03,880
in people telling me, you know what you should do next? You should translate. You should do this.

879
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:12,200
You should do that. Or several people have said, you should catalog your own experiments.

880
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:23,240
That's a hell of a big task, spread over a large number of years. So, suggestions like that are

881
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:30,920
always welcome. I may not immediately answer you because I get something close to 200 emails a week.

882
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:41,160
And so, sorting through it takes a fair slice of time. But if you do come up with a good idea

883
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:48,200
for stuff which has not been done but should have been done, then I would truly love to hear from you.

884
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:55,240
That was excellent. So, listeners, make sure to reach out to Dr. Skitter. If you have any

885
01:27:55,320 --> 01:28:00,920
suggestions on upcoming projects, Dr. Skitter is always dealing with a menagerie of different

886
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:06,760
projects. But if there's any other suggestions, please feel free to send those to Dr. Skitter as

887
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:12,440
well. Dr. Skitter, I know we have a very brief aftershow, but is there anything else about the

888
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:19,160
steganographia, trithymias, anything else at all, salamonic, evocatory aspects that you'd like

889
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:26,600
to leave listeners with? Oh, well, there's always lots of stuff to talk about. But with regard to

890
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:36,120
trithymias, as a person, he has lost a lot of fame that he was due. It's like John Dee. And for the

891
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:48,920
same reason that the powers that be depressed the story of their lives. I mean, if you ask the

892
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:55,560
average person, even involved in magic, what about trithymias? Quite a lot of people won't know. And

893
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:01,160
if you'd asked people about John Dee back in the 50s, they wouldn't have had any idea either.

894
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:17,800
So in restoring his work, that has been fun. Well, yeah, and it's got to be into English. It can't

895
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:23,640
be back into that because there are very few people now that read the classical languages.

896
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:35,000
My degree was in classics. So I focused on that in Greek. And then I did formal courses in Hebrew

897
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:43,720
as well, because I realized that that was necessary for magic. But none of those are very good in

898
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:55,320
traveling around. Certainly classical Greek doesn't work in Greece. And my Hebrew pronunciation is

899
01:29:55,320 --> 01:30:01,960
probably a bit crap and probably doesn't work in Israel, although there are other problems

900
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:07,480
happening there at the moment. I know Dr. Skinner myself and the listeners truly appreciate your

901
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:13,000
time. International author, scholar, he's collaborating again with Daniel Clark in this

902
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:19,720
upcoming tome, all four books of trithymias' steganographia for the first time presented

903
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:25,800
and translated in English together. Dr. Steven Skinner, thank you so, so much as always for

904
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:30,120
just taking the time and sharing your wisdom on the podcast today. Really appreciate it.

905
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:37,960
Well, I do as well, because you do ask the most interesting questions. And you understand the

906
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:46,920
subject, which is more than you can say for some of the podcasts. But anyway, well, thanks, Alex.
