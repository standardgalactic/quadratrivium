0	8320	Salutations, listeners, and welcome back to Glitch Bottle, the podcast where we uncork
8320	12240	the uncommon in magic, mysticism, and the generally misunderstood.
12240	17240	I'm your host, Alexander F., and today, as usual, we are so excited and honored to talk
17240	24180	about decrypting the Stegonographia with international author and scholar Dr. Steven
24180	25180	Skinner.
25180	30340	Now, listeners, I know you might be asking yourself, why is the Stegonographia the most
30340	36780	notorious work of the German Benedictine, Abbott, and polymath, Johannes Tritemius?
36780	39140	It was written in the year 1500.
39140	44220	Is the Stegonographia a text about the evocation of spirits?
44220	50780	Is it a system of cryptography where information is secretly encoded or both?
51340	56940	Internationally acclaimed author, practicing magician, and scholar Dr. Steven Skinner
56940	61020	is the perfect person to ask as he returns on the podcast.
61020	67380	Dr. Skinner has again collaborated with Daniel Clark in an upcoming publication where all
67380	73900	four books of the Stegonographia are being published in English for the first time with
73900	77220	extensive explanations and commentary.
77220	82540	It sounds like it is just going to be so vital and so excellent as usual.
82540	88100	This upcoming edition of the Stegonographia contains the remaining parts of books one
88100	94500	and three with detailed spirit registers covering 32 spirits, but it also features a full translation
94500	101580	of book two, which contains another 25 spirits and book four, which relates the Stegonographia
101580	107780	to Paracelsus, the Almadel, and the Shemham Farrash of Solomon, Adam, and Moses.
107780	114100	So this looks to be absolutely an excellent collection and a scholarly and important restoration
114100	119020	of the grimoire tradition of the magical tradition broadly speaking.
119020	124380	And with all that being said, Dr. Steven Skinner, thank you so, so much for taking the time
124380	128420	and stopping back on the Glitch Bottle podcast today.
128420	132380	It's always my pleasure and I do enjoy talking to you.
132380	134500	And you just summed it up perfectly.
134500	138340	I don't really need to say anything more too high.
138340	140340	Well, yes, sir.
140340	147260	But I will, because you can't shut me up anyway, nor would I ever want to.
147260	150220	I was going to say no comment, please.
150220	158140	So I could just mention, first of all, what does Stegonographia mean when it comes as
158380	167660	Alex has said it is sometimes seen as a cryptography manual and sometimes seen as a magic manual.
167660	172660	So I have to admit upfront, I know a bit about cryptography, but I'm not a cryptographic
172660	174660	expert.
174660	176340	But I do know a little bit about magic.
176340	181540	So the focus of this book is primarily in the magical direction rather than the cryptographic
181540	182540	direction.
182540	184500	But I'll explain all later.
184500	187380	So what does the word Stegonographia mean?
187700	190620	Well, it's made up of two Greek words.
190620	199260	And the usual translation is that it's secret writing, Stegopo secret and Graphia writing.
199260	207380	But if you look at the Greek properly, Stegano actually means watertight and Graphia is writing.
207380	211260	So it's actually a book of watertight writing.
211260	216100	And we may come to that a little bit later.
216180	221420	At least people now have heard of it and they stopped saying, is it a book of shorthand
221420	224420	or stenography?
224420	228620	In fact, I've had arguments with people about the spelling of it.
228620	230660	Oh, it should be Stegonographia, shouldn't it?
230660	233620	No, it's Stegonographia.
233620	237180	Okay, so who wrote it?
237180	240140	Well, the Abbott Trasimius.
240140	247060	Now, this is an amazing thing that an Abbott, well-known in Germany, actually wrote books
247060	257460	on magic and the Inquisition didn't turn up on his doorstep or drag him off in chains
257460	264620	because he had powerful friends like Maximilian, the Emperor Maximilian, etc.
264620	271580	But you had to do a little bit more than just have powerful friends to avoid the Inquisition
271580	273900	and their pals.
273900	281540	So the question is, was it a book on stenography with a bit of magic thrown in or a book on
281540	284060	magic with a bit of stenography thrown in?
284060	291660	And you have to ask yourself, if you were an Abbott in the year 1500 in Germany, which
291660	295660	of those two things would be the most inflammatory?
295660	301220	And the answer is, you're more likely to be done for magic than to be done for writing
301220	303380	secret messages.
303380	311420	So my conclusion from a long time is that it's a book on magic with cryptography thrown
311420	317660	in so that Trasimius had deniability.
317660	323220	If he was ever grabbed by the Inquisition, he could say, no, it's a book on secret writing.
323220	324220	Can't you see that?
324220	327260	Are you stupid or something?
327260	331500	And it's not, it's a book on magic.
331500	340140	And in it, there are, what was it, 57 spirits with full details, 25 plus 31, I think.
340140	346500	So that's 56 spirits.
346500	349060	And it's practical.
349060	354420	Now, how did Trasimius get into trouble with it?
354420	364660	Well, he sent a copy of it to his friend who was in Ghent and who was a Carmelite monk.
364660	368900	And he knew this guy was okay talking about magic.
368900	377820	And when he sent it, because the mail was not perhaps as fast as it is today, his friend
377820	383660	in the Carmelite monk had actually died.
383660	388940	So when it arrived, the head of the monastery there opened it, looked at the book and was
388940	396100	completely shocked because what is one of the church senior members, an abbot was a
396100	400980	fairly senior title, were doing writing a book on magic.
400980	409020	And that unfortunately for Trasimius is where his reputation as a magician began.
409020	416660	And he spent the rest of his life fairly cleverly sending it off and explaining what it really
416660	417660	was.
417660	426080	Anyway, so Trasimius was an abbot, a historian, a magician.
426080	427560	And a monk.
427560	429160	And how did that happen?
429160	433600	Well, I'm sure everybody said this story, but I'm just going to tell it because I like
433600	435480	this story.
435480	443440	He was coming back from having visited his family in Trittenheim and he was stopped by
443440	445040	a snowstorm.
445040	452720	So he pulled in, as it were, if he'd been driving, it would have been, to the local monastery
452720	456600	which put him up for the night.
456600	460120	The next morning he set out again, where the looked okay.
460120	464560	He didn't go very far and then a huge snowstorm came again.
464560	472280	And so he was forced to go back and plead, do you mind if I stay the night again here?
472280	476520	And I think he probably privately thought that it was the hand of God telling him this
476520	478720	is where he was supposed to be.
478720	484800	So instead of moving on on the third morning, he decided to join the monastery as an ordinary
484800	485800	monk.
485800	495440	He was in his late teens, but being an incredibly intelligent man who read and spoke a number
495440	503320	of languages, definitely Latin, definitely German, probably a dash of Hebrew, et cetera,
503320	506640	and some Greek.
506640	511560	The monks realized what a powerhouse intellect he was.
511560	517480	And when he was 22, maybe 23, they elected him as the abbot of the monastery.
517480	525000	And from then on it was up and up until the point where he sent his, unfortunately, deceased
525000	528160	friend, a copy of the Stegonographia.
528160	534840	One minor thing that people probably never mention is that his original name was Heidenberg
535840	542840	which literally translates from German as from the pagan mountain, which I think is
542840	546280	a lovely way of looking at his name.
546280	551680	But he took Trusenius to celebrate the fact that he was born in Trittenheim.
551680	556480	So it was a man from Trittenheim who became his name.
556480	562320	He was also the teacher of a gripper and to a lesser extent of Paracelsus.
562320	571480	But the gripper utilized his huge library of magical books to learn about magic and
571480	573760	then finally to write about it.
573760	577960	And I think nobody's going to argue if I said that a gripper's three books of occult
577960	587760	philosophy is probably the main text of Western magic.
587760	594760	So you could see Trusenius as being, if not the fountain head, at least a fountain head
594760	601320	of European magic and the actual fountain head was his library, but I'll talk about
601320	603360	his library a little bit later.
603360	610000	So Dr. Skinner, given all of that historical background with Trusenius, can you share about
610000	617680	what differences did you find between the printed Latin text and the manuscript that
617680	619200	you worked from?
619200	621040	Right.
621040	627080	So when I started this project, I was looking around and I saw that Adam McClain had actually
627080	635400	made a decent English translation, but he only translated volume one and volume three,
635400	640440	leaving volume two and volume four untranslated.
640440	647200	If anybody wonders whether there really was a volume four, then you just look at Culliana's
647240	653200	book, Eros and Magic in the Renaissance, where he confirms that there were actually
653200	655160	four books originally.
655160	659440	Anyway, so I was lucky.
659440	667200	In fact, it was Daniel Clarke, my co-author, who was lucky because he uncovered a manuscript
667200	674320	of the Stegonographia, which was not as old as the German manuscripts, but much more detailed.
674320	682720	So it was obviously translated at the point before people started losing or destroying
682720	684880	manuscripts.
684880	690320	And so as you can see on this picture, the illustrations were a bit sketchy.
690320	694280	This one just shows a few of the directions.
694280	698840	And people mostly thought, well, it was just an example of some directions, but no.
698880	706600	In the original manuscript by Josemius, which we don't have to hand, he showed all the directions.
706600	715080	So in the manuscript I worked on with Daniel, you can see much, much more detail.
715080	723680	So realizing that this manuscript that Daniel dug up had two more volumes and a lot more
723720	728680	detail and illustrations, which were much more complete.
728680	731960	I thought we got to translate it.
731960	735320	So and that was a mistake.
735320	740720	I mean, if I'd realized how much work had to go into this, I would not have made that
740720	741720	decision.
741720	747720	But anyway, I did make the decision and we went for it.
747760	750160	Well, that that is so lovely, Dr. Skinner.
750160	757760	And I think it actually follows a really interesting point that you made sharing many years ago
757760	760440	that when you first came across text.
760440	765400	So for instance, I remember a story and I forgive me, I'm going to butcher some of the facts,
765400	771000	but you were very young and you went to the local bookstore and you were trying to, I
771000	773760	believe it was the LeMegatins' Goat Asia or Crowley's.
774520	775920	It was. Yes.
776480	781080	And I love that when you would you win in and said, I would like to I have an order for this.
781080	784120	And the person up front said, oh, no, no, he's much too young.
784120	789600	And then finally, I think it was the manager that came front forward and said, oh, Steven,
789600	790680	he's he's fine.
790680	791400	It's OK.
791400	796720	You know, and I thought, what a what a powerful story about, especially at the time, you know,
796720	798640	discovering a text for the first time.
798760	804080	So to that point, Dr. Skinner, can you share with us when did you first come across this
804120	806720	specific text, the Stegonographia?
807320	814160	OK, but just to add a little bit to the anecdote you told there, the bookshop manager, it was
814160	819880	the Adiar Bookshop in Sydney and the manager was Cecil Novi, who has very sadly passed away
819880	826400	very recently, but she was a lovely lady and she was aware of the fact that it was fairly
826400	828680	safe to leave the Goatia in my hands.
828680	833360	And thank God she did because an awful lot of work came out of that.
834600	836640	Anyway, when did I first come across it?
836640	838680	Well, I'd been interested in Dr.
838680	840440	John Dee from way back.
843040	848200	And we're talking 13, 14, we're talking pretty precocious.
850120	860120	And in it, the reading about Dee, I heard that Dee had once copied by hand the whole
860120	867760	of the Stegonographia, sitting somewhere in, I guess, Germany, working from a Latin manuscript.
868560	874240	And I thought, well, if Dee thought it was that valuable, that it was worth the considerable
874240	875640	effort of copying by hand.
876160	880360	And here you can actually see a copy of that copy.
880760	886680	You can see that Dee had done a lot of work and his his illustration there is much more
886680	889120	complete than the printed one.
889760	897880	So I figured that the printed copies, even in German, were not as complete as some of
897880	899040	the manuscript copies.
899760	902040	So that was my first desire.
902120	902720	Wow.
903640	905640	If Dee thought it was good, it's got to be good.
906360	913000	And then Adam McClain, who is a guy who's very famous for his knowledge of alchemy,
913960	919720	arranged a partial translation of Volume 1 and 3 in 1982.
921280	926920	And by comparing it with the Latin, I realized that books two and four were missing.
928040	934080	So that gave me more reason still to produce a complete copy.
934760	939400	I decided to translate all four books into English, again, a foolish decision.
940160	945720	When I was convinced that there actually were four books and not just that three that
945720	946800	people had mentioned.
948000	949480	Ah, there you go.
950640	954200	Well, I believe and I try not to speak for the listeners, Dr.
954200	958160	Skinner, but your foolishness and the foolishness of Daniel Clark and everyone else has
958160	963200	certainly been to the to the boon of pushing the boundaries of understanding of the
963200	964080	Grimoire tradition.
964080	967920	So I must say, it certainly is a wonderful thing.
968920	971840	And speaking of Daniel Clark, actually, Dr.
971840	978120	Skinner, can you tell us this is several times now you have collaborated with Daniel
978120	978480	Clark.
978720	980600	How did how did this process work?
980600	983560	You know, you have two great minds tackling this text.
983560	985360	Can you tell us about that relationship?
986640	989520	Well, I have to admit, I've never met Daniel.
989640	992080	It's all been online communication.
992080	997720	But the communication has been very good because Daniel has got an amazing
997760	998200	brain.
999480	1006560	He's located down in Tasmania, and I was originally located in Malaysia and then
1006560	1009000	Singapore and now London.
1010680	1016200	But Daniel has his hand on where all of these manuscripts come from.
1017480	1023320	More than anybody else, I know he has an insight into which collections have got
1023320	1028440	which manuscripts and how to get copies of it and has a huge digital
1028440	1029120	collection.
1029840	1035440	And he was very generous from day one in lending them to me if I wanted to work
1035440	1039880	on them and finally I decided, well, let us work together.
1040480	1046000	He's a delightfully clearheaded guy and he doesn't take any kind of bullshit.
1046040	1048960	He's just does what he needs to do.
1049960	1056040	So we worked on it together and Daniel's many skills included dealing with these
1056040	1065400	libraries who hold their own manuscripts, but also research and repairing, digitally
1065400	1069600	repairing the manuscripts so that you go from something which looks appalling to
1069600	1071840	something which is actually very clear.
1072240	1078480	And if you can see here one that of the same picture that Daniel has restored,
1079480	1085360	so we've used his restorations in the book, it's so much better than trying to
1085360	1086560	look at the original.
1086560	1091240	We don't redraw them, no, we just take the original and clean it.
1091640	1098680	As well, Dr. Skinner, something you touched on at the beginning of our chat is that as
1098680	1103760	Joseph H. Peterson says, quote, the Stegonographia is Trithemis' most notorious
1103760	1109240	work. In private circulation, the Stegonographia brought such a reaction
1109240	1114400	of fear that he, Trithemis, decided it should never be published, end quote.
1114480	1117520	So Dr. Skinner, can you share with the listeners who might be hearing
1117520	1118920	about this for the first time?
1119120	1123320	Why was this work so notorious, if you will?
1124440	1129960	Well, I suppose the first push at being notorious was the
1130760	1136400	the Carmelite head of the monastery opening somebody else's mail and reading it
1136400	1141720	with horror, because he didn't just then put it on one side, but he sent copies
1141720	1143920	around and told other people about it.
1144800	1152160	Not very reasonable of him, but so that started off and people then sort of took
1152160	1158760	up, oh, this arbiter is doing magic, he's invoking spirits because here are all
1158760	1160880	the details in this book, blah, blah, blah.
1161760	1165600	And Trithemis then had a bit of a job tamping this down.
1166280	1172400	But the bottom line is that in dealing with spirits in this way was not natural
1172400	1179680	magic. And in those days, scholars, monks, et cetera, use the word natural
1179680	1181280	magic as defense.
1182560	1185560	So the church could go, hey, what are you doing?
1185560	1188120	And they say, no, we're just doing natural magic.
1188560	1194280	Herbs and stones and the 15 different varieties of correspondences, which
1194880	1197400	everybody knew about in those days, but they don't know.
1199720	1207200	And nothing about dealing with spirits in standing in a circle and stuff like that.
1208080	1213000	But of course, that is not the sort of magic that's in the Stegonographio.
1213000	1217040	It is spirit-based, evocatory magic.
1218440	1226880	They go and Trithemis destroyed or suppressed the more extreme parts to
1226880	1228200	save his reputation.
1228240	1231960	But fortunately, some of the translations, including the one we work from,
1232920	1235240	escaped without being too heavily cut.
1235960	1240600	There is always a possibility that we haven't got the most complete
1240600	1244320	manuscript in existence, but I can be very sure that it's...
1247040	1251680	I can't think of a percentage, but it's twice as complete as any of the other
1251680	1255200	manuscripts wandering around or even the printed version, because the printed
1255200	1258760	version was from an early Latin version.
1259080	1264760	One of the first times, Dr. Skinner, that I heard about this debate with
1264760	1267560	the Stegonographio, is it cryptography?
1267640	1268680	Is it sorcery?
1268840	1272520	Was actually, and I'll reach in my bookshelf here, one of my favorite tomes,
1272520	1276920	the Goetia of Dr. Rudd, the third volume in the Sourceworks of Ceremonial
1276920	1280800	Magic series, where you and David Rankin explore this issue and you touched
1280800	1283600	on it just a few moments ago, Dr. Skinner.
1283600	1289280	So I'll just ask, you mentioned that the Stegonographio is a book about magic,
1290040	1296040	not cryptography, but what is the relationship between encoding messages
1296160	1298560	and then the sending of those messages to spirits?
1298560	1300480	Can you just give us kind of the full picture?
1301400	1306520	Okay, so this is quite a subtle point, so it takes a bit of explaining.
1307240	1313320	So first of all, what is the relationship between evoking a spirit and using cryptography?
1314400	1320400	And there is a relationship, so that some grimoires suggest that the
1321400	1326360	evocation should be encrypted, or the name of the spirit should be encrypted, etc.
1326800	1329360	And that always sounded a bit weird to me.
1330000	1335640	But then if you think about what Aston Aston and Spare was doing, he was taking
1336160	1342360	the magical result that he desired written in English, and then he was
1343680	1349200	using cryptography or his own version of cryptography to produce something
1349200	1352880	which doesn't mean anything, a series of letters and things.
1353600	1361800	So he was also using cryptography before calling for the spirit.
1362720	1368520	And one of the things there is, of course, you ask the question, what languages
1368520	1369760	do spirits speak?
1369880	1375880	And in the Middle Ages, they would have been assumed to speak Latin and possibly Greek,
1376880	1382560	which was good because everybody in those days spoke Latin, not the case anymore.
1384360	1393400	And therefore, what you needed was to focus on the outcome that you're looking for,
1393400	1394760	or the name of the spirit.
1395800	1401440	And one of the practices is you could encrypt it, because when you encrypt
1401440	1404280	something, you have to think about it a lot.
1405280	1414360	And so this, as it were, underlined the desired results, and it got through to the spirit.
1414960	1418960	Whereas if you just stand in the middle of the room and quickly read off something you
1418960	1422880	wrote 10 minutes ago, this doesn't have the same impact.
1422960	1427280	So it's increasing the impact by encrypting.
1427720	1433160	Now, sending messages via spirits is a different thing.
1433560	1437720	But you can still use cryptography to stress it.
1438960	1440600	So let's stand back from there.
1442280	1450920	What Christos Emius was aiming at was the 1500s version of email.
1452000	1459440	He wanted to be able to send messages to monks who knew about magic in other monasteries
1459440	1464200	on the other side of Germany or Czechoslovakia or in Italy or whatever.
1465720	1472080	He didn't very sadly have email, but he figured, and it is true, that he could use
1472120	1473840	spirits to take the message.
1474040	1475880	So you give the message to a spirit.
1476120	1478320	You first of all, you've got to call the spirit properly.
1479080	1485240	Give the message, the spirit, and tell the spirit to deliver it to Mr.
1486200	1490400	Orwellis in Prague or something.
1491920	1494120	And the spirit will do that.
1494280	1500640	But the problem with the message is when he gets there, the recipient will not either
1500640	1505240	understand the message or understand that something has been sent to him.
1505880	1510360	So it had to be with somebody who also understood the magic, who knew what the
1510360	1516440	invocation was to material, not materialize, but to consolidate the spirit and to
1516440	1517240	get the message.
1517600	1521120	So it's kind of a complicated procedure, just like with email.
1521120	1527880	You need machinery at one end to encrypt the message into electrical pulses.
1527880	1532960	And then you need machinery at the other end to unencrypted, as it were, into a piece
1532960	1535000	of sensible English.
1535680	1539320	Dr. Skinner, where have you practiced this?
1539360	1542040	Have you engaged with the steganographia?
1542560	1544160	Yes, I have experimented.
1544160	1550280	And I have to say that unless the recipient is well trained, well versed in the
1550280	1551880	method, it's quite difficult.
1552960	1560240	And so I found that sometimes I can simply send the message so that the person dreams
1560240	1564160	about it rather than the spirit actually explaining it.
1564960	1568440	But then I thought, well, I don't look going to waste much more time on this
1568480	1573000	because email is much, much more efficient and much, much more accurate.
1573720	1580240	But there's a 500 year gap between one method and the other.
1581040	1587480	So although the objective of a lot of the steganographia is to send spirit
1587760	1592920	carried messages, there is other stuff in there that's of use to people who are
1592920	1594040	interested in magic.
1594480	1599960	Dr. Skinner, as well, something that ties into what you just shared is people
1599960	1604800	have been wondering for centuries if the steganographia is a book about encoding
1604800	1606280	messages or summoning spirits.
1606280	1609200	You just added a bunch of excellent context there.
1609480	1614240	And to that point, we have a few listener questions for you from Glitchbottle
1614240	1616560	patron Anna Maddalena.
1616600	1623440	And Anna is asking her first question is, I'm very eager to know what details you
1623440	1626800	have culled from the steganographia, Dr. Skinner.
1628240	1634800	Well, one of the details that I found most interesting is that the steganographia
1634800	1640320	has across two of its books, two complete spirit registers.
1641240	1646720	Now, a spirit register will be familiar to anybody who's read the Goetia.
1647360	1651920	It's a list of spirits with details about what their offices are.
1651960	1657760	In other words, what it is they're capable of doing and sometimes their schedule.
1658600	1661680	So that was the first thing.
1662200	1669240	But in the steganographia, every spirit has its own private invocation, which is
1669240	1674880	very rare, probably completely unique, because the usual procedure is you have
1674880	1678640	a standard evocation into which you insert the spirit's name.
1679640	1686000	But this is somewhat more powerful because you are using an evocation in a
1686000	1693520	language which I'm not going to specify, but one not very commonly known to call
1693680	1699400	that spirit and that spirit should get the message a lot easier.
1700480	1707000	Talking about that, somebody once asked me, what senses do spirits have?
1708000	1714880	Well, I can tell you that they can hear even at, well, is it a remarkable
1714880	1720000	distance or are they in fact very close, but in another dimension, but they can
1720000	1725440	certainly hear and the spirit will recognize its own name, even if you
1725440	1726800	mispronounce it a little bit.
1727800	1732920	The other thing they can do is they can smell because the choice of
1732960	1735400	incenses is critical for magic.
1736840	1742000	You have different incenses for different planetary spirits, for example.
1743520	1749480	And spirits actually are attracted by beautiful smelling atmosphere.
1751480	1757280	So when you say that the spirit is invoked, you can make things convenient
1757280	1762680	for him by burning or vaporizing a smell that he likes.
1762680	1767400	So I can say that spirits have a sense of hearing, a sense of smell.
1768320	1775800	I can also say that their sight is not that clear because I've done certain
1775800	1780040	experiments and I'll just leave it at that, that they're not very clear with
1780040	1784560	sight, maybe it's the difference of working across two different worlds.
1785520	1792720	But given those two things, the sense of smell is the hint why
1795640	1802320	magicians have to bath or clear themselves immediately before an
1802320	1806880	operation because they do not like the smell of human beings.
1808640	1812680	And so in fact, some magicians recommended that you actually
1812760	1819440	study yourself with some sweet smelling incense or whatever and that works quite well.
1819720	1823000	Dr. Skinner as well, this just popped into my head.
1823000	1826400	So let me just let me just ask you between Anna's questions.
1826400	1829960	But in another one of your tomes, I feel like I'm pulling every book off
1829960	1834400	of my bookshelf here and the nine Rudian provocations.
1834400	1838920	The Solomonic Archangels and Demon Princes, one of the pieces of advice
1839400	1842440	that is given is to never.
1842640	1846600	It's one of the beneficial aphorisms says never mix experiments.
1846600	1851480	So you either focus on more celestial operations or more sublunar,
1851480	1855360	if you will, slash catholic operations for these spirits.
1856080	1861720	Would you classify the spirits and the Stegonographia as angelic or in the
1861720	1866280	Theurgia, Goetia, they seem to be these aerial spirits, these dukes that can wander.
1866280	1868240	Can you share a little bit about that?
1868720	1872960	They're actually sublunar spirits or aerial spirits.
1874040	1876560	So they can float around in the atmosphere.
1877880	1882320	If you get them to materialize, then they will be just floating around
1882320	1884880	rather than standing on the floor or anything like that.
1885400	1888800	Subluna is a nice word, anything under the moon,
1889600	1894120	but it excludes sonic or subterranean spirits,
1894160	1897160	which are a completely different sort of animal.
1898880	1900360	Excellent. Thank you, Dr. Skinner.
1900360	1903920	I know myself and I'm sure the listeners really appreciate that.
1904840	1907640	Back to Anna's question and his next question.
1907920	1912040	We broke these up a little bit and is asking and commenting, Dr.
1912040	1916640	Skinner, that it always struck me as strange that important state secrets
1916640	1919520	would be encoded by lists of spirit names.
1919520	1921640	Can you comment on this a little bit?
1922640	1926560	Yeah, the messages are not encoded by the spirit names.
1926560	1931960	The spirit names are actually labels for particular encoding messages.
1931960	1936400	So if it was, say, parmesiel,
1937360	1942200	this is a particular encoding procedure.
1942480	1946360	So then they're labels and you could have used animal names.
1946360	1950920	It could have been the giraffe encoding and the rhinoceros encoding.
1951600	1954120	But Trasimus has used spirit names,
1954760	1959640	which is confused a lot of people because they are trying to see some connection
1959640	1965080	between the encoding and the magic, which I've vaguely explained already.
1965520	1970240	To Anna's next question, Anna is asking, in particular, Dr. Skinner,
1970240	1974280	I'm wondering if you agree that the occult aspect of the text
1974280	1977400	is merely a blind for the deeper cryptographic work
1977400	1983120	or if it has a double valency as both a code book and an esoteric tone?
1984440	1991240	Well, it does have a double valency and Trasimus must have been a fantastically
1991240	1995960	bright guy because he's managed to work both things into the text.
1996760	2001160	But the cryptography gives him deniability.
2002120	2006440	If he's brought up before a body of his peers or the inquisition,
2006440	2010840	he can say, no, you stupid people, you can see it's about cryptography.
2011320	2015000	And I've just used magic to frighten people away from it
2016440	2019320	because he knows he can't be done for cryptography.
2019320	2020200	It's not a crime.
2021160	2027080	However, evoking spirits might very well be a theological crime.
2028040	2033560	So when he's got that deniability, it's achieved itself.
2033560	2039880	But his cryptography is also there and it's not the most efficient cryptography.
2039880	2045320	So you might need 100 words to just make a very short message.
2046520	2051240	And there are much better ways of making short messages cryptographically
2051240	2053080	rather than wasting so many words.
2054360	2057480	But what do I know about cryptography?
2059720	2061080	Quite a lot, quite a lot.
2061080	2066520	And so it seems, Dr. Skinner, that Anna's saying exactly what you just commented on,
2066520	2071800	which is in some places in Europe, possessing such a book of necromantic names,
2071800	2075640	those demonic names could get you in as much trouble or more trouble
2075640	2078760	as passing along state secrets, it seems.
2079400	2080680	Yeah, absolutely.
2080680	2088920	I mean, state secrets, well, for example, D was an intelligence for Elizabeth I.
2089880	2094360	But I'm sure a lot of the stuff that he was sending back to England
2094360	2095640	wouldn't have got him into trouble.
2096440	2104760	But having been convicted of evoking evil spirits from the church's point of view,
2104760	2107320	that would have definitely got him into trouble.
2107320	2113640	So the necromantic names are much more dangerous than passing on secret information.
2114200	2119080	One of your primary areas of focus, Dr. Skinner, and it's even in the name of one of your books,
2119080	2123400	is the techniques, the technological application.
2123400	2129000	And you mentioned, along with David Rankin in the Goetia of Dr. Rudd, a wonderful tome,
2129000	2137400	that, quote, the same tables used to encrypt also produced the spirit names, end quote.
2137400	2142040	So roughly, Dr. Skinner, can you share with listeners who might be hearing about this
2142040	2143320	for the first time?
2143320	2145480	How does this whole process work?
2145560	2150840	Is the practitioner supposed to derive the spirit names first and then encrypt
2150840	2152280	a message for the spirit?
2152280	2153400	How does all that work?
2154360	2156280	No, it's two separate processes.
2156280	2161080	So you can generate spirit names by using tables of Hebrew letters,
2163320	2170360	using a sigil to tell you which cell in the table you go to from which cell and on to which cell
2171160	2179240	you spell out a name, or even the reverse process, you spell the name onto the table
2179240	2180920	and that gives you the spirit sigil.
2181800	2186040	Because the ingredients that you need for an evocation are the name of the spirit,
2186840	2193000	the sigil of the spirit, and then you need to calculate what's the best time to call them,
2194680	2195880	et cetera, et cetera.
2196520	2201960	That's using tables to produce the name of spirits or to check the sigil or to reverse
2201960	2207960	that, but it's not the whole process.
2208920	2212680	Encrypting the message for the spirit is a separate process.
2212680	2218600	So you know the spirit name, you call the spirit, you tell the spirit your message in
2218600	2224920	whatever form, whatever language, whatever cryptographic form, and then he will convey
2224920	2234280	that more or less accurately, and I can't swear always accurately, to the distant friend or
2235560	2241960	who is similarly aware of this magical technique, and then he will say the necessary words,
2242680	2246840	and more often than not, the message will come to him and dream.
2247240	2255800	The trisimus says the spirit will whisper it in his ear, but my experience is that
2255800	2257080	doesn't always happen.
2257080	2261560	It's more likely to turn up in the dream on the following night.
2262120	2264760	Reminds me, Dr. Skinner, of something you touched on before.
2265640	2272200	There's a, I believe in the PGM, there's a spell that says that you can have a message
2272200	2279320	and the deity will appear in someone else's dream as the God that they believe in,
2279320	2280760	as opposed to what you believe in.
2282520	2284440	That's a very sneaky piece of magic.
2287400	2293640	I do know the method for inserting thoughts into other people's dreams in such a way that
2293640	2299880	they will believe it's their own thought, because you wake up in the morning and not all the thoughts
2299880	2308600	in your head do you immediately recognize, but a much more effective way is to have
2309320	2314680	in that person's dream a figure who is their God appear to them and tell them,
2315240	2319160	you must do this, you must do that, and then they can go, oh my God told you.
2320680	2324760	If it's a Catholic, it may be a saint.
2325720	2332600	If it's a pagan, then it may be a pagan God, but to incorporate that God into the
2332600	2336120	delivery of the message makes it very highly effective.
2337240	2341800	As well, Dr. Skinner, I think this next part touches on something that you brought up at
2341800	2346600	the beginning of our chat and also something David Rankin talks about when he, in his
2347320	2352920	Grimoire Encyclopedia, when he talks about the building of magical momentum or magical tension
2352920	2360600	and you say, quote, that the mental effort involved in encoding the message to the spirit
2361160	2367480	is part of the magical procedure, end quote. Can you share why is this so important, Dr. Skinner?
2368680	2373960	Well, most people take a very casual attitude to magic. I'll just quickly
2373960	2379160	rattle through the invocation and then I'll tell the spirit what I want. No, you have to use
2379160	2384840	a lot of, I wouldn't say brain power, but a lot of intention.
2387320	2392120	People will say that magic is mostly psychological. I definitely don't believe that,
2392760	2401560	but I know that when you do it, it must be done with intention and carefully and precisely,
2401880	2406520	which is why three of my books start with the word techniques of.
2407960	2417560	Technique comes from a Greek word, which means a craft or a procedure. I like to think of
2417560	2425080	magic as something that is done scientifically, but only scientifically in the sense of
2425960	2433080	method. So you try something out, you record your results, you formulate series and that,
2433080	2437880	and then you test the series. Well, it's not quite as complicated as that in magic,
2437880	2442360	because a lot of the instructions are already available in the grimoires,
2443480	2451560	and so you use them, but you use them carefully and with attention. Just as if you were driving or
2451560	2460360	flying a rapid plane, you need attention and intention, otherwise you might come to a nasty,
2460360	2467960	nasty sticky end. Yes, so you would consider Dr. Skinner this mental technique, this preparation
2467960	2473480	of encoding the message as just as important as, say, gathering your materia magica, your wand,
2473480	2477880	your sword, consecrating things. It sounds like it's that important to the technique.
2478440	2483400	Yeah, yeah, and producing your ray of tools and people say to me, well, why do you need
2483400	2490120	tools for magic? Why can't you just sit in your arm chair and think about it? That does not work,
2492360	2498280	but at least it doesn't work for me. There may be people who can do that, but not anybody I
2498280	2506600	immediately know. And you see the same thing in Chinese magic or even martial arts. I mean,
2506680	2513240	there's a well-known story of a village which was being attacked by some raiders,
2514200	2526120	and one of the team masters there tried to contract a samurai to teach them how to fight with
2526120	2532840	swords and fight these people off who are destined to arrive in the next week or something. And of
2532840	2538440	course, the master said, you've got to be kidding. I can't teach you what you need to know in a week.
2539000	2545080	Tell me what you do know. And he said, well, I know how to do the tea ceremony. And I do that
2545080	2555240	with a lot of attention. And I do that regularly. And I'm really a master of that. So the samurai
2555240	2562120	simply taught him how to clean the sword and replace it in a scabbard and told him to apply
2562120	2569960	the same degree of intention to that as he did to the tea ceremony. So when the raiders turned up,
2571320	2575800	there was the team master pretending to be head of the village,
2576600	2584040	and laid out in front of him was one or two pieces of equipment. And he cleaned them and
2584040	2588760	presented them in the way that he would have done for the tea ceremony. And the raiders looked and
2588760	2594680	they saw this guy treats his tools like this. He obviously knows what he's doing.
2595400	2604600	We'll go and find an easier village to raid and they left. So the point of that slightly oblique
2604600	2612360	story is that the weapons and they are called weapons of magical practice need to be treated
2613080	2620680	great deal of respect and intention. And they need to be exercised and consecrated.
2622680	2629400	And these actions then give them much more than psychological power, but it does give them
2630440	2636520	power that then can work. And the spirits can appreciate that. They look at a magician who
2636520	2643880	lays out his tools properly, leans them, wraps them in the right colored silk and so forth. And
2643880	2649640	they figure, this guy knows what he's doing. We better not mess with him.
2651240	2658360	People find it hard to understand when I explain it. But I think the Chinese team master
2659240	2663000	is a good parallel. Absolutely. One of the ways I've phrased it is,
2663720	2667480	based on everything that you've shared and Fraterashin Shasan and other guests is,
2668520	2674280	instead of operating on the laws of physics, many grimoire interactions and evocatory procedures
2674280	2681160	operate on the laws of meaning and intention and being able to meet them in a specific laid-down
2681640	2688200	pre-mutually agreed upon terms and a specific ritualistic structure that gets results. I don't
2688200	2694360	know if that's a fair way to think about it. And going back to previous conversation we had a few
2694360	2705000	minutes ago, in the Greek magical papyri and in the old Egyptian temples, anybody who had just
2705000	2711080	eaten garlic or fish was not allowed to come in and was certainly discouraged from doing any ritual
2711880	2718280	or worship or ritual inside the temple because the spirits do have a great sense of smell.
2719480	2724920	So the spirits can cotton on to what we're doing, that we're doing the right technique
2725800	2733720	and that we are masters of what we are doing. And that instills a certain amount of fear and
2733720	2739240	obedience. Dr. Skinner, in addition to those vital elements, one of the things that you mentioned
2739240	2745400	that's necessary for the successful completion of an evocatory procedure in the grimoire tradition
2745400	2752840	is the seal, the sigil of the spirit. And to that very point, the very few number of seals
2752840	2760120	found in the Stegonographia match exactly to the seals found in the second book of the Lamegaten,
2760120	2767160	namely the Theurgia Goetia. So can you share, Dr. Skinner, why doesn't the Stegonographia contain
2767160	2774600	more of these seals? Right. So as I've already explained, to call the spirit, you need its seal
2775400	2780360	so that it's not sufficient to have the Stegonographia. You've got the evocations,
2780360	2786680	you've got the spirits' names, you've got the times, etc. But when Trasimius is writing that,
2786680	2793080	he also composed the Theurgia Goetia, Don't Be Distracted by the Name,
2794040	2800840	which I think is a later edition. And in that, he had the same spirits, but he had their seals.
2801400	2808440	And he knew, being a sensible lad, that you should keep these two elements separate. However,
2808440	2812200	if you're a practicing magician, then you need to bring these two elements together,
2812920	2818280	and you use the seals in the Theurgia Goetia, which you've got the same spirit names as the
2818360	2824760	invocations, etc. in the Stegonographia. So I suppose this is a little plug for,
2825720	2834040	yes, if you're going to do this, you also need to buy Dr. Rudd's Goetia, because in there will be
2834040	2841720	the seals that you need. I see that Alex is waving it around. Thank you very much. And that's another
2841800	2849880	coincidence. It's part of my progress through the Grimoires to cover, hopefully, all the bases
2851000	2859800	by the end of my time. I think historically, the Theurgia Goetia was made at the same time
2859800	2867560	by Trasimius and kept separate. And its path as a manuscript has been different from the Stegonographia.
2868440	2874200	But you can now, because they're both in English and they're both published by me,
2874200	2876360	you can bring them together and make it work.
2877560	2883720	It's a truly very, very valuable resource for people who want to read about it, for people who
2883720	2889640	want to practice this. I'm certainly looking forward to it, Dr. Skinner. And just as a brief
2889640	2895720	follow-up question, do you think the author of the Theurgia Goetia used tables to derive
2896360	2898920	the numerous seals just as a follow-up to that?
2900440	2908760	No. You don't use tables to derive the seals. This is a technical area I don't want to get into,
2909320	2914280	but they were derived at the same time, I think, and then put in a separate manuscript.
2915000	2922360	Of course, Trasimius, being the abbot, had all these monks in his scriptorium who would write
2922440	2927320	stuff for him. So this is something I would have loved to have myself,
2927960	2933480	instead of having to type it. I'm one finger typist, and I just type with one finger,
2933480	2939960	and it's not nearly as fast as being able to hand some rough copy to a monk and say,
2940600	2948440	go off and inscribe that on parchment or whatever, such luxury. But on the other hand,
2949000	2956520	I don't have the inquisition looking over my shoulder or what was left of the English laws
2956520	2964520	against magic, which I think they abolished in 1951, which is a bit late, but at least they've gone.
2965480	2970040	So it's a trade-off. So I'm happy.
2970040	2975160	Yes, those are powerful, motivating forces. And as a fellow one-finger type, or I certainly
2975160	2978200	sympathize, Dr. Skinner, fully, fully, absolutely.
2980680	2987160	My mother said, I said, I need to learn to type because I'm going to produce a few, more than
2987160	2992600	a few words. And she said, no, you don't. You'll always have a secretary. Your father had a secretary.
2992600	2995480	You'll have a secretary. You don't need to learn it. And then she was wrong.
2998040	3003000	It's like, right. In addition to being the scholar and translating things and pouring
3003000	3008520	over manuscripts and the welcome library, in addition to all of that, you also are then typing
3008520	3016280	through everything, of course. Yes. I've tried one little program where you speak,
3016280	3021640	and it types it up for you on the screen. But it always gets the technical words wrong.
3021640	3026440	And so you've got to go back and retype. And in the end, I've timed myself. It's almost
3026440	3032360	just as fast to type it yourself. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. It would be very hard to tell
3032360	3037880	Microsoft Word or something to, you know, Bane Chuch or Adonai Shaddai El Chai, you know,
3037880	3042680	it might, it might not get all the, all of the letters correct. Yeah. So you got to,
3042680	3046200	you got to go back and rework and see, might as well type it in the first place.
3047080	3054120	Right. Absolutely. That's just my problem, not anybody else's. Earlier, I asked you if you
3054120	3061240	practiced the steganography and you shared your answer. But just as a follow-up, since you publicly
3061240	3066680	shared about experimenting with the LeMegatins Goatia, as you've shared, and also the Arsonatoria,
3067240	3073080	have you experimented with the Theurgia Goatia? Or, or is there anything else you'd like to
3073080	3078120	touch on about experimenting with either the steganography or the Theurgia Goatia?
3079400	3085560	Yes, I have. But because to actually do it right with the steganography, I need to
3085560	3091320	re-import the sigils. And I thought when I produced this edition, maybe I should sneak
3091320	3097640	the sigils back in, but that's not, it's not academically acceptable to do that. So you still
3097640	3104120	got to put two books next to each other and, and work on it from there. I'm still working my way
3104120	3112120	through the, what was it, 56, 57 spirits. There's some I'm just never going to get around to, but
3112120	3116200	I've worked my way through handfuls of the more interesting ones.
3116760	3122200	You were talking about the samurai story earlier, one of your magical colleagues and one of our
3122200	3127640	magical friends, Frater Ashen Chassan, an excellent grimoire, a traditionalist and practitioner.
3128680	3133320	He has a question for you, Dr. Skinner, saying, Dr. Skinner, can you please share about how
3134280	3139160	the angels, or if the angels, inspired the techniques or the technology for the ciphers
3139240	3144680	themselves, what are your thoughts on the angelic involvement in imparting the knowledge for coded
3144680	3152280	information found in the steganographia? I don't think the angels taught Trasimius
3153000	3161800	cryptography. For a start, a lot of Trasimius' cryptography is very, very stalled at having
3161800	3171160	to translate a large, as I said before, say 100 words into a five-word message or something.
3171800	3177800	It's just not practical. So I don't think they did. I think that you've got to give
3177800	3184440	Trasimius' brain the credit for the cryptography. Thank you for that additional context, Dr. Skinner.
3184440	3190120	And speaking of other guests who have been on the podcast, we have a listener question for you
3190120	3197480	from Mihai Vartajaru, who is asking and saying, Dr. Skinner, are the 31 spirits listed in the
3197480	3203480	steganographia actual spirits that may be contacted, or are the spirit names just an
3203480	3209800	ideal spirit catalog devised by Trasimius as an example of his cryptographical method?
3211400	3219080	Well, I've sort of answered that already. I can see that Mihai is working from old English
3219080	3226200	translations, or even from the Latin, because he only mentions what was it, 31 spirits.
3226840	3232360	Whereas, in fact, when you add in the second volume, you add another 25.
3234360	3242120	No, the spirit names are real. They do come to you. They will come. And they will do work for
3242120	3249800	you if you approach it in the right way. They're not just empty counters for his cryptography.
3250520	3257480	Now, I admit that my bias is biting in here that I'm not interested in cryptography because
3258520	3269480	there are now programs like some of the cyber currency things with passwords which are, I don't
3269960	3275880	know, 56 letters long or something, which do cryptography well above anything that
3276680	3285320	Trasimius could have done. But his magic still works. But his cryptography is still a bit slow.
3286600	3292040	I don't think the angels provided it to him. If they had, it might have been a little bit more
3292040	3298040	efficient. Yes, that's one of the things, among many, that I'm so thankful for is your insistence,
3298040	3302280	Dr. Skinner, on practicality. I remember in a previous interview, you said that,
3302280	3306600	and I'm inserting the word tortured here, but you even tortured yourself learning Demotic Greek,
3306600	3313400	not for liturgical or the appreciation of history for practical use. So, you go to very
3313400	3322600	far lengths to have a practical effect on the results of magic. Yes, learning Greek was just
3323560	3332360	so much pain, but what worth doing. Absolutely. And you've touched on a few figures here,
3332360	3337560	Dr. Skinner, historical figures and researchers, practitioners. We have a follow-up question
3337560	3344440	for you from Mihai Vartajaru, who is asking, is Dr. Skinner aware of the 20th century Romanian
3344440	3351640	historian, Ioan Petruculiano, who attempted to decipher Trasimius's cryptographic code?
3353480	3361560	Yes, I'm very aware of Culiano. He's one of the academics who have actually done practical magic,
3362600	3369160	which means that his other academic colleagues were a little bit wary of him,
3369160	3374600	because he's not around anymore. And he left Romania and went across the States,
3374600	3381400	where he finally worked at the University of Chicago. But terrible things happened to him.
3382120	3389720	He was actually assassinated in the toilet block of the Divinity School of the University of
3389720	3398440	Chicago. Now, why he was assassinated, I think, in my opinion, is because he kept
3399880	3406120	abusing the post-Chachescu communist regime and saying bad things about them.
3407080	3413880	He was certainly disliked by Chachescu. I have another story about Chachescu,
3413880	3422600	which I probably shouldn't tell. But getting back to Mihai's question, yes,
3423880	3431080	Culiano's book, Eros and Magic in the Renaissance is full of useful stuff. It's not
3431080	3437640	greatly arranged. You don't go easily from one topic to another. But there are lots of gems
3437640	3444840	scattered throughout that book. Shall I tell my Chachescu story? I've been wanting to ask you,
3444840	3452600	yes, because you've teased it out so well. So please, sir. Okay. I worked for a publishing company,
3453160	3460440	which was owned by Robert Maxwell. And Robert Maxwell knew Chachescu, because he was involved
3460440	3468200	with a lot of Eastern European regimes. He also knew Brezhnev. He used to go drinking with him,
3468200	3472760	which must have been quite the effort, because Brezhnev could really hold his booze.
3474920	3482120	Anyway, in conversation, Chachescu asked Maxwell once, well, you know, I've got a bit of a bad
3483080	3489880	image, certainly a very bad image, because he was doing lots of bad things. How do I clean
3489880	3497880	my image up? And they came up with the idea, well, we should write a sort of vaguely sterilized
3500360	3506920	biography saying all the great things you did. Of course, then it was up to Chachescu to think of
3506920	3515000	some of the great things that he'd done, apart from demolishing about a quarter of his capital city
3515480	3521400	to build one of the largest palaces ever seen. And he must have used an enormous amount of the
3521400	3531080	country's wealth to do that. But that's another issue. Anyway, I'll not get too personal about
3531080	3542200	this, but Maxwell hired with a bit of advice, somebody to write this book. And Chachescu provided
3542200	3549800	tons and tons of information. Most of it had to be adjusted to make it sound good.
3550920	3561000	And the book was written. And because I was involved, the book was printed. And I can't
3561000	3565400	remember how many copies. It wasn't a lot of copies, because Maxwell didn't think it was
3565400	3571640	still very well. But he needed to send 20 or 40 copies to Chachescu to show that he kept his
3571640	3579880	side of the deal. Let me think, that must have been round about Christmas 1989,
3581080	3588600	because I was working in publishing back in those days. And just as it was about to be launched,
3588600	3599480	Chachescu was tried very quickly in one evening, taken out of the back and shot along with his wife
3600440	3607240	so that the opposition forces then took over Romania. And we were left with the
3607240	3615560	warehouse full of this made-up story about Chachescu. So I got an urgent message from Maxwell,
3615560	3623960	destroy it, destroy it. And I did. I kept two copies, which must rank amongst the
3624040	3629720	rarest copies in the world. And the rest went off. I can't remember whether it was
3629720	3632840	burning or shredding, but it was definitely completely destroyed.
3633480	3636280	Just as a quick aside, you've had so many
3637800	3641160	involvements and fingerprints with other publications. For instance, I'm thinking of
3641160	3646520	the wonderful Black Easter novel with with Blish and the conversations that you've had.
3646520	3652680	I'm thinking of that humorous yet very teachable story at university about Alice Bailey and this
3652680	3659640	person dropping off a truckload of books of Alice Bailey, too. So it seems like you're right that
3659640	3665960	in this case, I mean, this was a very intense personal involvement and literally being told
3665960	3671240	to destroy those books. I mean, wow, yeah. Someday actually had to do the dirty work of
3671240	3679640	destroying them. But the command came down from Maxwell, who I, because I was on his
3680600	3688520	magazine publishing site, I saw fairly frequently. But that's that's stories for another day.
3688520	3695160	Given all this, Dr. Skinner, did Culliano deal with Trithemius's system and offered the first
3695160	3700120	version of an invocation of a spirit prince in his book about magic in the Renaissance?
3701080	3703960	Well, I have to correct that and say it wasn't the first
3704200	3710360	version of an invocation of a spirit prince because a lot of grimoires have been concerned with that
3711560	3717960	over the over the period, because spirits are quite hierarchical, or at least the way we understand
3717960	3724920	them is hierarchical. So they have princes and dukes, etc., which is mainly perhaps a reflection
3724920	3730600	of the way society was structured in the Middle Ages, where it could be actually some real
3730600	3737880	structuring. Culliano's story was not the first, but it was probably the first time
3737880	3745640	a professional academic had had explained that. Culliano used to make an offer to his
3746520	3756520	senior PhD students that they could learn magic with him, but only on condition that they did
3756520	3762600	each of the experiments as was taught by him. So he had a limited number of takers on that,
3762600	3769720	but he did actually teach practical magic to some of his students. All I can say is lucky them.
3769720	3776200	When I was at university, I didn't get any offer like that and had to fight my own ways
3776200	3782440	through the sources to find out how it works. You know, when it comes to technique and the
3782440	3786760	important elements of magic, you've been tracing this out for years, you've been connecting the
3786760	3792680	various techniques over, you know, thousands of years, and you and David Rankin in your
3792680	3799240	excellent collaborations, you mentioned that for a system like the Theurgia Goetia, that of course
3799240	3805560	is heavily dependent on the steganographia, that three elements are needed, the encoding of the
3805560	3811800	message, facing the correct direction, and the proper time of the day or the night. So
3812600	3817800	broadly speaking, do you feel, Dr. Skinner, that all three of these elements are vital to all
3818600	3826520	grimoireic operations and all grimoireic work? Yeah, basically, yes, but particularly time and
3826520	3834120	direction, because it's one thing that the spirits understand and we understand. And
3834200	3840760	regards to timing, although some of the times listed in The Goetia,
3841720	3848200	which relate to the titles of the spirits, don't actually work that well.
3849160	3856920	But timing that relates to the planetary hours and the planetary days, that works very well.
3857880	3867560	And people ask me, well, why should calling a spirit at 8am on a Wednesday, a mercurial spirit,
3868520	3874600	work better than calling it when it's convenient for me at 6pm on Thursday?
3875800	3884280	And my answer to that is, well, if you want to talk to your doctor and you turn up this surgery at
3884280	3895560	3am on Sunday night, do you think you're going to get any help at all? And the answer is that spirits
3895560	3905160	do have, what do you call it, not a schedule, not a thing, but there are times when it's good
3905160	3912440	to try and talk to them and there's times when it's not good. You wouldn't invoke a spirit of
3912440	3921640	Venus in a Saturnian hour on a Saturday, because you're stacking it against yourself if your
3921640	3929880	invocation is very powerful, maybe. But why make life difficult? And so timing is very important.
3929880	3936760	The other thing about direction, well, as you can see from one of the illustrations that I showed
3936760	3946280	earlier, the spirits have specific directions. And if you wanted to talk to somebody and you
3946280	3952520	walked into their room and you turned your back to them whilst trying to convince them to do something,
3953560	3957560	they're going to think that's very rude and they're just not going to be helpful.
3958360	3962600	Now, spirits may not think you're very rude. They may think you're a little bit stupid because
3962680	3969000	you don't know the correct direction. But I think that, well, I know that invocations,
3969000	3973720	when invocations, which are done facing the correct direction work much, much better.
3974600	3984440	So that's time and direction. This bears on the steganographia because the first two books have
3984440	3991400	got the spirit lists in them. One of the books deals only with direction, which is the first
3991400	4000680	book. And the second book deals only with time, which is the planetary hours, etc. So there you
4000680	4006520	are. It's very clear that two different sets of directions. I find in practice, if you get them
4006520	4018840	both right, then that's even better. The question of cryptographic things is not so important.
4018840	4025400	Cryptographic is a bit important in steganographia, but there's a lot of magic where cryptography or
4026280	4033080	messing up the words in the way that AI is spare dead is not so important, but time and
4033080	4040200	direction are essential. Excellent. Thank you, Dr. Skinner. I know myself and I know the listeners
4040760	4046200	always appreciate those vital reminders no matter what grimoire direction you are looking at
4046200	4052520	exploring. That's excellent. We also have a listener question for you, Dr. Skinner, a few from
4052520	4058680	Andrew Nichols. And Andrew is saying, in the first part of the question, we broke these up a
4058680	4064520	little bit, I'm not as familiar with Dr. Skinner's work as I hope to be one day. So forgive me if
4064520	4069560	this has already been covered in his work, but as someone living in Australia, I'm frequently
4069560	4076040	confronted by the northern hemisphere-centric nature of the majority of the esoteric and
4076040	4082280	goetic canon. As a fellow, Antipodian, who has spent at least some of his career based south of
4082280	4087960	the equator, I wonder if Dr. Skinner has any thoughts about how to navigate this.
4089400	4096120	Okay. Well, this is a very interesting question for me because it is applicable to magic, but it's
4096120	4102920	also applicable to my other great interest, which is classical Chinese Feng Shui. And I don't mean
4103800	4109800	simply moving your furniture around or painting a wall red or whatever else. I mean, the really
4109800	4117960	classical stuff which I have been interested in for a long time. And that question is asked, well,
4117960	4122680	if all these Feng Shui rules work for the northern hemisphere, what do we have to do in the southern
4122760	4129080	hemisphere? Should we flip them on their head? Because climatically, the warm bits are in the
4129080	4136120	north, as is the thing from in Europe, the warm bits are in the south. And the quick answer is no,
4136120	4145480	you shouldn't. Because although climatically, the two hemispheres are quite different. In fact,
4145560	4152840	in terms of direction, they're the same because east is the same direction in the northern hemisphere
4152840	4159560	as it is in the southern hemisphere. West is also the same direction. Even north and south
4159560	4167880	are the same direction. It doesn't all scramble as you go across the equator. And then further to that,
4168840	4175240	as I lived in Singapore for 14 years, Singapore is very close to the equator. You could almost
4175240	4182520	say it's on the equator. And I did not notice walking from one side of the island to the other any
4182520	4192760	difference. Nor did I notice anything in Indonesia south of the equator that's distinct from Singapore.
4193480	4198760	And so the short answer is no, you don't have to flip things either for feng shui or for magic.
4199560	4206840	So also for feng shui, it's much clearer because direction is a very big thing in feng shui.
4207640	4217480	It's also very important in magic. And no, you don't have to bend it around. Oh, the other thing,
4218280	4227880	I had a friend who said that if we're doing horoscopes, the seasons are different. So
4230120	4237880	you should flip the horoscopes as well. So I said, okay, give me a detailed analysis of myself.
4238680	4243320	And he produced something which was diametrically opposite to everything that I'm made up of.
4244120	4252680	And that killed it for me that no, you don't need to mess around like that. It's just
4253960	4257960	perfectly good to use the same rules in both atmospheres.
4259720	4265880	And this follows Dr. Skinner with materia magica, I would assume as well, because
4265880	4271160	Andrew is asking and saying, for example, does Dr. Skinner feel it would be more efficacious to
4271800	4277880	cheat quote unquote by buying a hazel wand online or to experiment with substituting
4277880	4286120	an Australian tree so that I can cut the branch myself? Okay, the essential thing is it should
4286120	4293240	be hazel, not that you should cut it yourself. If you've got the hazel and you've bought it
4293240	4298280	through Amazon and somebody else has cut it on the other side of the world, it doesn't matter.
4298280	4306440	You still have an hazel wand. And the spirits will know that if you turned up with a eucalyptus
4306440	4313320	wand waving it around, this is not hazel wand. And then they'll just ignore it.
4315080	4323240	So you don't need to do a special change. And besides which, if you decided to just
4323240	4327480	select a different tree, you might have to go through 100 different varieties of tree before
4327480	4335800	you got one that was even halfway as good as hazel. So stick with the plan. Don't unnecessarily
4335800	4347320	mess it around. As Frida Ash and Jason once said, you still have to make changes on some of the
4347480	4355880	some of the magical procedures, but they're usually quite small and they're usually not
4356760	4363000	to make life more convenient for you so that you can have any old stick rather than a hazel wand.
4365160	4371480	Yes, it's about putting in putting in the work and putting in the effort. And I very much appreciate
4371480	4377160	Andrew's question and you sharing your expertise, Dr. Skinner, because those questions, I think
4377240	4382520	do come up when people wonder, especially in this global chipping world and everything else. So
4382520	4388760	that is lovely. And Andrew also has a final question as well, Dr. Skinner saying, okay,
4389800	4396520	while moving from hazel wands to say, with seasonal timings or the dates of pagan festivals that
4396520	4401640	align with the seasons, which I know is moving away somewhat from Dr. Skinner's area of expertise,
4401640	4407400	but he's mentioning as an example, can these Dr. Skinner be transferred south of the equator
4407400	4415560	wholesale or should they also be flipped? Okay, well, we'll start with saying not flipped, but
4417720	4427880	if it's a cultural thing, then maybe you do have to adhere to its site of origin. So for example,
4427880	4433720	I can tell you from practical experience that dealing with spirits like fairies
4435800	4443800	works quite efficiently in Wales or Scotland in Celtic areas. But trying to invoke those same
4443800	4453560	entities in Singapore does not work or it doesn't work for me anyway. So there is an element of
4453560	4462600	that, but you don't just flip it, you don't then say, well, we'll invoke a demon of some other source
4463800	4471640	simply because we're in the southern hemisphere. No. So you have to, for spirits, they are sometimes
4471640	4478680	located in particular areas and they will not happily go from there. Most demons however,
4479160	4485640	are available throughout the world. If they're called right, they will come because they're not
4485640	4491880	culturally embedded in one particular area or another. So following through on cultural embedding,
4493240	4499640	if you're trying to call an Australian Aboriginal spirit, you will not have much
4499640	4507880	of a chance outside of Australia or indeed outside of some of the more barren areas of Australia.
4508840	4515160	Which is the same thing as don't try calling fairies in Singapore.
4517160	4523640	Yes. And some of the spirits, as you so excellently delineated Dr. Skinner, for instance,
4523640	4527800	in the steganographia, these are sub-lunar spirits. These are not cathonic spirits,
4527800	4533240	but it sounds like it would be fair to say that spirits found in the steganographia,
4533240	4539800	the Lemegetans' Goat Asia, the Ariel Kings and the Heptameron, these are not spirits that are bound by
4540680	4546200	a specific section of the globe. These can be called pretty much no matter where you are if
4546200	4551960	you follow the appropriate method. Would that be somewhat fair? Yep. Yeah. That's definitely fair.
4553160	4558280	I picked two extreme examples which are very culturally connected to the Australian
4558360	4565560	aborigines and the fairies, but for most other spirits, they are available throughout the world.
4566760	4571160	Excellent. Well, Dr. Skinner, returning to this theme of techniques, for example,
4572600	4577480	I've seen this online and I'd just love to run this by you. You see this kind of
4578280	4585800	general misconception online that, and again, this is a false dichotomy and almost a caricature,
4585800	4592360	but some people might say, well, solematic magicians, they're purists who want to reduce
4592360	4599240	the grimoires to only cookie-cutter mathematical steps that are mechanical and repeatable,
4599240	4603720	and it's sterile. And when I'm online and I say I do the grimoire this way, I have a grimoire
4603720	4609880	or a purist saying, no, you need to do it this way. But to me, talking with you, Frater Ashton
4610600	4617480	I mean, so many practitioners, I get the opposite that this is very, very much based on
4618600	4624200	the methods, the scientific method, but it's also based on developing your own individual
4624200	4629960	relationships with spirits. So can you kind of share about this conception or misconception
4629960	4635560	that people might have, Dr. Skinner, about it only being a strictly mechanical process?
4636440	4644120	So there's several elements there. It is mechanical in the sense that you have to do
4644120	4654120	the right things to make it work. If you burn tar and stand on a beach without a circle or
4654120	4661320	something, it's not going to work. You have to do the right actions with the right tools in the right
4661320	4673960	place. But that's not cookie-cutter, is it? So don't confuse that with my own scientific approach
4673960	4682840	to it. But with any technique, if you're a brain surgeon, you need to attack the right part of the
4682840	4690280	brain, not with a spoon and fork, but with the right equipment. And you need to do it at the right
4690280	4698120	time when the person is under anesthesia. Otherwise, you'll cause terrible problems.
4698680	4707960	So yes, you need to observe the rules. But that doesn't make you cookie-cutter. Magic is not
4707960	4717000	simple. You have to work at it quite hard. Ashton Chase initially did a number of operations
4717720	4723000	where people would have just given up, but he persisted and then he figured out what was the
4723000	4730920	small change that needed to be done to make it work right. Then the other thing is a lot of
4730920	4739000	people say that you need to create a special bond with the spirits. That is certainly true
4739000	4748680	if you're trying to create or encourage a familiar. But if you're just using, and I say
4748680	4754280	using, because I mean using, one spirit for one particular action and you may not call them again
4754280	4761640	for a long time, such bonds are not necessary. But the correct procedure is still necessary.
4763320	4768360	So would it be fair to say, Dr. Skinner, just to button up this topic, if someone's out there
4768360	4772440	listening, they love your books, they're reading about the Solomonic method, and if they're wondering,
4773160	4779240	well gosh, why is Dr. Skinner so focused on repeatability and the steps? I think it would be
4779240	4785480	fair to say that you can easily teach the steps, but it's not so easy with personal relationships
4785480	4790360	because those are so idiosyncratic. They're based on your unique interaction. Would that be fair?
4790920	4797080	That's absolutely true. Let me draw one more parallel, which I previously done.
4799240	4806840	Working with spirits, invoking them and training them, if you like, to answer and do the things you
4806840	4813720	want, is just like working with a, trying to domesticate a horse. If you get a wild horse,
4814520	4819880	there are several ways you can do it, you know, but you will certainly need to put a hold on.
4821960	4827400	You will certainly need to have them in an enclosed space. In this case, the horse needs to be kept
4827400	4834600	inside the railings of the park, unlike spirits which need to be kept outside the railings of
4834600	4843960	the magical circle. Then you can't just shout at them in English or Latin or Hebrew. You need to
4843960	4855240	actually use tools like sugar lumps, or if you're a harsh person, a whip, but you need to have these
4855240	4862040	tools to domesticate a horse and you need to observe the same rules. There's a fast way to
4862040	4868840	domesticate a horse and a very slow way. If you make up your own way, it probably will take forever
4868840	4874680	and it won't succeed, but if you use the standard procedure, you will domesticate the horse and then
4874680	4881880	you will later ride it safely and you'll need to harness it unless you're very clever at bareback
4881880	4889400	riding. It's like any task, you need to do it the right way. You don't need to cookie cut it,
4890040	4898040	but you need to do a method which has been proved to work in the past so that that's all.
4899960	4906600	David Rankin in the Grimoire Encyclopedia mentions that in his decades of experience with, for
4906600	4912680	instance, the LeMegatinsk Oasia, and I'm probably paraphrasing or butchering this, but he effectively
4912680	4919720	said he didn't find he needed to use, in the goetic context, more of the putting the sigil
4919720	4926840	in the fire and burning specific foul-smelling things, but that over time using the barrel
4926840	4933720	and ensis conjuration, using certain aspects of the vinculum that he could get those results.
4933800	4937240	Does that kind of go to what you're saying about, hey, there are various techniques,
4937240	4942680	there are various paths, but the goal should always be to engage with the spirit so that it
4942680	4948360	is successfully called and bound? Yes. The procedure is that you should use,
4949160	4957800	first of all, as close as possible to the standard Grimoire procedure. It's only later when you can
4957800	4964520	do it and you can call the spirit and direct it two or three times, then you can ask it,
4965560	4971240	how would it be easier for me to call you if the spirit says, well, if you have a radish
4971240	4976840	present on the altar, then it will work much better. That's a bad example, but you will get
4976840	4983480	information from the spirit and then you can use it. As David has been working at this for a very
4983480	4992040	long time, he has modified stuff, but these people who start and decide immediately they want to
4992040	5002680	modify it, oh, I'll use a kitchen spoon rather than a wand and I'll do this and I'll do this.
5003640	5008600	This is not going to work and you're just hobbling your progress.
5009000	5019400	I should add that since my first evocations, I have now been doing magic for 60 years and
5020440	5029720	not that I'm 60, I'm somewhat older than 60. During that time, I have had to work really hard to
5029720	5036520	get the message to work for me, but once they're working for me, then I can make slight changes
5036600	5044440	in things and then it's repeatable. Because it's a technology, it is repeatable. You don't want to
5044440	5051880	have to climb the mountain every single time and you can come back and even shorten the technique,
5052440	5057320	but you've got to do it right first and have it succeed and then after that you can think about
5057320	5064680	what you might like to change. I can't hack it with pupils who want to change everything to start
5065000	5071240	with. I want to do it in the weekend and I want to do it without the right tools and I'll use
5071240	5079240	my brain and none of that works. Right, exactly. Just substituting Thor for every reference to
5079240	5085720	Adonai in the Hepatameron would not be a good first step in the ritual. I think that's safe to
5085720	5093640	say, yes. Absolutely. Okay. Well, thank you, Dr. Skitter. So listeners, we just have a few more
5093640	5098360	questions for Dr. Skitter and a very brief aftershow about some interesting points about
5098360	5104520	consecration. But before we get there, listeners, I just want to remind you, please check the podcast
5104520	5112200	and video descriptions to click on the link to pre-order your copy of Dr. Steven Skitter and
5112200	5119640	Daniel Clark's steganographia. The links will be below. But Dr. Skitter, just as we get ready to
5119640	5123960	wrap up the main part of the podcast, you're always working on something. I remember you said
5123960	5128600	that you have a list in front of you of many different projects and as you go through, you pick
5128600	5134200	and cross some of them off. So can you give us any hints about what other projects you are working on
5134200	5144680	right now? Yeah, this is my latest project. You only get a quick look at that and you can see my
5144680	5157080	penciling on the Latin. And it's another book by Etrusemius. And it's to do with the origin of
5157080	5165560	many of the grimoires. And so it is faintly complementary to David Rankine's fantastic
5165560	5172680	grimoire encyclopedia, for which there's no replacement at all. This is merely a supplement
5172760	5181000	that which I hope people will like. And that project is 85% finished,
5182680	5185720	but it will take a while before it finishes up on bookshelves.
5188120	5193880	Excellent, Dr. Skitter. I know myself and I know the thousands of listeners are very... We'll keep
5193880	5199240	our ear to the ground on that, as always. Can you tell us, Dr. Skitter? Of course, listeners can
5199240	5206520	click the links below and pre-order their copy of the book. And how else can they support you? How
5206520	5211880	can they check out your other works? Obviously, I'm thinking of Golden Horde Press, but anything
5211880	5218280	else you'd like to share with listeners, how they can best support you? Well, I'm always interested
5218280	5223880	in people telling me, you know what you should do next? You should translate. You should do this.
5223880	5232200	You should do that. Or several people have said, you should catalog your own experiments.
5233560	5243240	That's a hell of a big task, spread over a large number of years. So, suggestions like that are
5243240	5250920	always welcome. I may not immediately answer you because I get something close to 200 emails a week.
5251880	5261160	And so, sorting through it takes a fair slice of time. But if you do come up with a good idea
5261800	5268200	for stuff which has not been done but should have been done, then I would truly love to hear from you.
5269480	5275240	That was excellent. So, listeners, make sure to reach out to Dr. Skitter. If you have any
5275320	5280920	suggestions on upcoming projects, Dr. Skitter is always dealing with a menagerie of different
5280920	5286760	projects. But if there's any other suggestions, please feel free to send those to Dr. Skitter as
5286760	5292440	well. Dr. Skitter, I know we have a very brief aftershow, but is there anything else about the
5292440	5299160	steganographia, trithymias, anything else at all, salamonic, evocatory aspects that you'd like
5299160	5306600	to leave listeners with? Oh, well, there's always lots of stuff to talk about. But with regard to
5306600	5316120	trithymias, as a person, he has lost a lot of fame that he was due. It's like John Dee. And for the
5316120	5328920	same reason that the powers that be depressed the story of their lives. I mean, if you ask the
5328920	5335560	average person, even involved in magic, what about trithymias? Quite a lot of people won't know. And
5335560	5341160	if you'd asked people about John Dee back in the 50s, they wouldn't have had any idea either.
5341960	5357800	So in restoring his work, that has been fun. Well, yeah, and it's got to be into English. It can't
5357800	5363640	be back into that because there are very few people now that read the classical languages.
5364040	5375000	My degree was in classics. So I focused on that in Greek. And then I did formal courses in Hebrew
5375000	5383720	as well, because I realized that that was necessary for magic. But none of those are very good in
5384520	5395320	traveling around. Certainly classical Greek doesn't work in Greece. And my Hebrew pronunciation is
5395320	5401960	probably a bit crap and probably doesn't work in Israel, although there are other problems
5401960	5407480	happening there at the moment. I know Dr. Skinner myself and the listeners truly appreciate your
5407480	5413000	time. International author, scholar, he's collaborating again with Daniel Clark in this
5413000	5419720	upcoming tome, all four books of trithymias' steganographia for the first time presented
5419720	5425800	and translated in English together. Dr. Steven Skinner, thank you so, so much as always for
5425800	5430120	just taking the time and sharing your wisdom on the podcast today. Really appreciate it.
5431240	5437960	Well, I do as well, because you do ask the most interesting questions. And you understand the
5437960	5446920	subject, which is more than you can say for some of the podcasts. But anyway, well, thanks, Alex.
