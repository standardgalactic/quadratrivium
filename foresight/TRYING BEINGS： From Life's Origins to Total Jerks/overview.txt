 The concept of an "auto-cell" represents a theoretical model for a transitional form between non-life and life, which could potentially arise in a pre-life universe without any external intervention. This model integrates two key processes that have been considered in origins of life scenarios: auto-catalysis and encapsulation.

Here's a summary of how the auto-cell model works, based on the principles of chemistry and physics:

1. **Auto-catalysis** is a process where certain chemical reactions occur at an accelerating rate until the reactant molecules are depleted. In this process, catalytic molecules (often depicted in green) facilitate the bonding between other non-catalytic molecules (purple and red), which then form new catalysts that can further facilitate more reactions. This creates a chain reaction of autocatalysis, where the production of catalysts happens by compound interest, leading to an acceleration of the cycle until resources are exhausted.

2. **Encapsulation** is a spontaneous process where larger molecules form structures like tubes or spheres that enclose other molecules, effectively preserving them in close proximity and protecting them from the environment. These encapsulations can temporarily stabilize the products of the autocatalytic cycle.

3. In the auto-cell model, **autocatalytic cycles** become mutually supporting with encapsulation. The encapsulation helps preserve the catalysts, allowing for sustained autocatalysis and potentially leading to self-reconstituting systems. These systems, known as auto-cells, can alternate between a closed, seed-like state that preserves the contents, and an open, growth-like state where the autocatalytic cycle can begin anew if transformable molecules are present.

4. **Self-reconstitution** is a key feature of auto-cells. They have the ability to regenerate themselves after opening, which means that they could potentially reproduce or evolve over time. This self-reconstitution would lead to a population of autocell lineages with varied characteristics, subjecting them to differential survival and thus natural selection.

5. Although auto-cells would not be defined as living by traditional biological criteria, they would exhibit some features that are characteristic of life, such as metabolism (through the autocatalytic cycle), replication, and potentially evolution—making them the simplest evolvable units in a pre-life context.

The auto-cell model provides a framework for understanding how non-living chemical processes could give rise to self-sustaining, evolvable entities, which is a crucial step in the emergence of life from non-life. It demonstrates that the laws of physics and chemistry alone can lead to complex behavior that resembles key aspects of biological systems.
