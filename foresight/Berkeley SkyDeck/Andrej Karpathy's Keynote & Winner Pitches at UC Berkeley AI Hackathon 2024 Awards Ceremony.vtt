00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
Welcome to the clothing ceremony of UC Berkeley's AI Hackathon.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.680
I want to call on stage the awesome,

00:09.680 --> 00:14.280
incredible executive director of Skydeck, Caroline Winat.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.400
Thank you, Rene.

00:16.400 --> 00:20.160
Hi, everybody. How are you doing?

00:20.160 --> 00:24.480
Awesome. You ready to hear who won the Hackathon?

00:24.480 --> 00:26.880
Yes, you are. How many hackers here?

00:26.880 --> 00:28.360
How many in the audience?

00:28.360 --> 00:30.880
Oh, nice. Very good.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.440
All right. We're going to get started because I think you want to hear Andre.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.200
Yes, you want to hear Andre.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.520
Yes, you want to hear Andre.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.680
All right. Let's quick run through.

00:39.680 --> 00:43.080
You want to hear some cool facts about what has been happening.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.760
This is what we're going to do today.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.040
We're going to get to our pitches soon.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.920
This is some pictures.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.880
All you hackers, did we have fun?

00:50.880 --> 00:52.480
Did we have a good time?

00:52.480 --> 00:54.800
I had an absolute blast.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.600
Yes, there were llamas for sure.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.160
I was there most of the time.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.120
I was not there at 3 a.m.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.440
But I was so impressed with all of you.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.840
You hacked your hearts out.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.360
And I'm so proud of all of you,

01:08.360 --> 01:12.120
whether on stage or in audience, you're all completely awesome.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.120
All right. How many people they took to make this happen?

01:15.120 --> 01:18.960
This giant number, 371.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.800
UC Berkeley Skydeck, which I represent,

01:21.800 --> 01:25.720
and Calhacks Educational Program and Student Organization.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.360
So I think we did a pretty decent job of getting this all together.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.920
This is how it breaks down.

01:30.920 --> 01:35.520
Hackathon at Berkeley Directors, Skydeck staff, sponsors.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.880
We're going to give some love to sponsors.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.520
As I mentioned, we're an educational program.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.680
Calhacks is a student organization.

01:42.680 --> 01:46.040
This is all because of the sponsors.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.400
So we're going to give them a ton of love

01:47.400 --> 01:48.640
when they come up on stage.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.800
You with me? Awesome.

01:50.840 --> 01:55.320
Okay, 140 judges, 100 plus volunteers,

01:55.320 --> 01:58.760
and 80 mentors hanging out helping everybody.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.680
Let me tell you a bit about Skydeck.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.920
Who hasn't heard of Skydeck?

02:02.920 --> 02:04.200
Anybody?

02:04.200 --> 02:05.320
A couple of you.

02:05.320 --> 02:09.320
Skydeck, UC Berkeley's flagship accelerator.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.880
We host 250 startups a year.

02:11.880 --> 02:15.560
Our accelerator track gets $200,000 in investment

02:15.560 --> 02:17.760
from our dedicated Venture Fund.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.160
Pretty cool.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.600
Let me tell you about Berkeley Skydeck Fund,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.640
our dedicated Venture Fund.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.480
Investing in about 40 startups a year.

02:25.480 --> 02:28.600
That's a lot of startups for an adventure fund, by the way.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.480
The 200K investment.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.000
And who wants to apply to Skydeck?

02:33.000 --> 02:36.080
July 16, I want to see all of your startup applications

02:36.080 --> 02:37.040
coming in.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.400
That's in a month.

02:39.400 --> 02:43.840
And hackathons at Berkeley are an amazing student organization.

02:43.840 --> 02:48.680
Truly extraordinary people who helped put this on this event.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.680
This is, of course, what they do.

02:50.680 --> 02:51.760
They do hackathons.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.000
They've been doing it for 10 years.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.160
They do about 2,500 students a year.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.120
And, of course, they reach a ton of universities.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.760
How many people here not from Cal?

03:02.760 --> 03:04.320
Hacking not from Cal?

03:04.320 --> 03:05.480
Fantastic.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.600
Welcome.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.720
Berkeley is a place where we bring great talent in.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.040
Y'all are great talent.

03:11.040 --> 03:11.880
We brought you here.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.480
That's what we do.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.960
That's what Berkeley Hackathons does.

03:15.960 --> 03:21.840
Come to their 11th big hackathon in San Francisco in October.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.080
Check them out on social media.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.840
Get on that LinkedIn, all of that.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.440
Who's coming to San Francisco?

03:27.440 --> 03:28.440
Y'all coming?

03:28.440 --> 03:29.080
Yes!

03:29.080 --> 03:31.000
OK, fantastic.

03:31.000 --> 03:31.840
All right.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.120
Thank you to our partners, all of you

03:34.120 --> 03:37.080
who brought your hackers here, including our friends

03:37.080 --> 03:38.320
down to the South Bay.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.480
Thank you for joining us and all the other great universities.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.560
Fantastic.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.400
Really happy to have you.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.600
Do you want to hear Andre?

03:46.600 --> 03:49.000
Do you want to hear Andre?

03:49.000 --> 03:49.880
Yes!

03:49.880 --> 03:54.040
Please give a huge round of applause for our keynote speaker,

03:54.040 --> 03:55.360
founding member of OpenAI.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.120
I need the applause.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.080
Come on, keep going.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.560
Andre, come on up.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.120
Carpathian.

04:01.120 --> 04:04.080
Yes, big applause.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.080
Thank you.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.040
Hi, everyone.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.480
Yeah, so thank you for inviting me.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.440
It's really a great pleasure to be here.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.680
I love, love, love hackathons.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.600
I think there's a huge amount of energy,

04:19.600 --> 04:21.560
a huge amount of creativity, young people

04:21.560 --> 04:25.120
trying to do cool things, learning together, creating.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.880
It's just like my favorite place to be,

04:26.880 --> 04:28.480
and I've had my fair share of hackathons.

04:28.480 --> 04:33.080
So really a great pleasure to be here and talk to you today.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.040
So one thing is this is bigger than I expected

04:36.040 --> 04:37.280
when they invited me.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.240
So this is really large here.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.600
I kind of feel like actually the scale of the hackathon

04:42.600 --> 04:44.160
is quite large.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.400
And I guess one thing I wanted to start with

04:46.400 --> 04:49.280
is that just in case you're wondering,

04:49.280 --> 04:51.600
this is not normal for AI.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.720
I've been in AI for about 15 years,

04:53.720 --> 04:55.600
so I can say that with confidence.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.560
And it's kind of just grown a lot.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.560
So for me, AI is a couple of hundred academics

05:02.560 --> 05:05.280
getting together in a workshop of a conference

05:05.280 --> 05:08.800
and talking together about some esoteric details

05:09.240 --> 05:10.400
of some math.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.480
And so this is what I'm used to.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.400
This is when I entered AI about 15 years ago.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.160
You're working with, say when you're training neural networks,

05:18.160 --> 05:20.440
you're working with these tiny digits from MNIST.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.280
You're training a restricted Boltzmann machine.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.720
You're using contrastive divergence to train your network.

05:24.720 --> 05:28.840
And then you're scrutinizing these on your first light

05:28.840 --> 05:30.600
to make sure that the network trained correctly.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.440
And I know none of that makes any sense

05:32.440 --> 05:34.280
because it's been so long ago,

05:34.280 --> 05:36.080
but it was a different vibe back then

05:36.080 --> 05:37.760
and it was not as crazy.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.120
I think things have really gotten out of proportion

05:40.120 --> 05:42.000
to some extent, but it is really beautiful

05:42.000 --> 05:43.280
to see the energy.

05:43.280 --> 05:47.240
And today, 15 years later, it looks a lot more like this.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.120
So this is, I guess, where AI is today.

05:52.120 --> 05:55.000
And that's also why this event is the largest I expect.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
So yeah, NVIDIA, the manufacturer of GPUs,

05:57.000 --> 05:58.520
which is used for all the heavy lifting

05:58.520 --> 05:59.600
for our neural networks,

05:59.600 --> 06:03.040
is now the most valuable company in the United States

06:03.040 --> 06:04.440
and has taken over.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.520
And this is the day that we live in today

06:06.520 --> 06:08.800
and why we have so many hackathons like this and so on,

06:08.800 --> 06:10.120
which I think is quite amazing,

06:10.120 --> 06:11.440
but definitely unprecedented.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.320
And this is a very unique point in time

06:13.320 --> 06:16.720
that many of you maybe are entering the AI field right now.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.280
And this is not normal, it's super interesting,

06:18.280 --> 06:20.320
super unique, there's a ton happening.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.320
Now, I think fundamentally the reason behind that

06:22.320 --> 06:25.120
is that I think the nature of computation

06:25.120 --> 06:26.520
basically is changing.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.640
And we're kind of have like a new computing paradigm

06:29.640 --> 06:30.960
that we're entering into.

06:30.960 --> 06:31.920
And this is very rare.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.760
I kind of almost feel like it's the 1980s

06:34.760 --> 06:36.360
of computing all over again.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.560
And instead of having a central processing unit

06:38.560 --> 06:41.480
that works on instructions over bytes,

06:41.480 --> 06:42.800
we have these large language models,

06:42.800 --> 06:45.800
which are kind of like the central processing unit

06:45.800 --> 06:49.320
working on tokens, which are a little string pieces instead.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.680
And then in addition to that,

06:50.680 --> 06:51.960
we have a contact window of tokens

06:51.960 --> 06:54.000
instead of a RAM of bytes.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.400
And we have a coolant of disk and everything else.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.000
So it's a bit like a computer.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.720
And this is the orchestrator.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.120
And that's why I call this like the large language model,

07:02.120 --> 07:03.520
LMOS.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.560
And I've sort of like tweeted about this

07:05.560 --> 07:07.280
in some more detail before.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.520
And so I see this as a new computer

07:09.520 --> 07:12.160
that we're all learning how to program

07:12.160 --> 07:14.600
and what it's good at, what it's not as good at,

07:14.600 --> 07:16.280
how to incorporate into products,

07:16.280 --> 07:18.920
and really how to squeeze the most out of it.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.760
So that I think is quite exciting.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.960
And I think maybe many of you have seen the GPT-40 demo

07:23.960 --> 07:26.680
that came out from OpenAI two, three weeks ago

07:26.680 --> 07:27.720
or something like that.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.720
And you're really starting to get a sense that

07:29.720 --> 07:33.120
this is a thing that you can actually talk to.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.760
And it responds back in your natural interface

07:37.760 --> 07:40.440
of like audio and it sees and hears and can paint

07:40.440 --> 07:42.200
and can do all these things.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.240
I think potentially many of you have seen this movie.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.920
If you haven't, I would definitely watch it.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.120
It's extremely inspirational for us today, movie Her.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.600
And actually kind of presently in this movie,

07:52.600 --> 07:55.360
when this main character here talks to the AI,

07:55.360 --> 07:57.880
that AI is called an OS, an operating system.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.280
So I think that's very present from that movie.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.920
And it's a beautiful movie and I encourage you to watch it.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.200
Now, the thing is that in this movie,

08:05.200 --> 08:07.200
I think the focus is very much on like the emotional

08:07.200 --> 08:09.280
intelligence kind of aspects of these models.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.400
But these models in practice in our society

08:12.400 --> 08:14.440
will probably be doing a ton of problem solving

08:14.440 --> 08:15.800
in the digital space.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.920
And so it's not just gonna be a single digital entity

08:17.920 --> 08:21.000
that kind of in some weird way resembles a human almost

08:21.000 --> 08:22.160
in that you can talk to it.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.200
But it's not quite a human, of course.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.000
But it's not just a single digital entity.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.720
Maybe there's many of these digital entities.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.320
And maybe we can give them tasks

08:30.320 --> 08:32.040
and they can talk to each other and collaborate

08:32.040 --> 08:33.720
and they have fake slack threads.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.680
And they're just doing a ton of work in the digital space.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.640
And they're automating a ton of digital infrastructure.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.640
Not just a digital infrastructure,

08:41.640 --> 08:43.600
but maybe physical infrastructure as well.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.120
And this is kind of an earlier stages, I would say,

08:46.120 --> 08:48.200
and will probably happen slightly lagging

08:48.200 --> 08:50.200
behind a lot of digital innovations

08:50.200 --> 08:53.160
because it's so much easier to work with bits than atoms.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.200
But this is another movie that I would definitely point you to

08:55.200 --> 08:56.400
as one of my favorites.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.400
It is not very well known at all.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.680
It's called iRobot and it's from 2004.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.520
Will Smith, amazing movie.

09:02.520 --> 09:05.040
And it kind of explores this future with human robots

09:05.040 --> 09:07.120
doing a lot of tasks in society.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.880
And kind of spoiler alert, it doesn't go so well

09:09.880 --> 09:11.000
for these people in this movie.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.680
And the robots kind of take over a little bit.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.640
But I think it's kind of interesting to think through.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.120
And I definitely would encourage you to also watch this movie.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.200
And this movie takes place in 2035, allegedly,

09:22.200 --> 09:23.640
which is 10 years away.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.960
And so maybe in 10 years, you can definitely squint

09:25.960 --> 09:28.120
and think about that maybe we are gonna be in a place

09:28.120 --> 09:30.520
where these things are walking around

09:30.520 --> 09:32.360
and talking to us and performing tasks

09:32.360 --> 09:34.080
in physical world and digital world.

09:34.080 --> 09:34.920
And what does that look like?

09:34.920 --> 09:35.760
What does that mean?

09:35.760 --> 09:36.800
And how do we program them?

09:36.800 --> 09:40.600
How do we make sure that they sort of do

09:40.600 --> 09:42.200
what we want them to, et cetera?

09:43.520 --> 09:45.720
So when you put all this together,

09:45.720 --> 09:48.560
I think the feeling that people talk about often

09:48.560 --> 09:50.160
is this feeling of AGI.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.240
Like do you feel the AGI quote unquote?

09:52.240 --> 09:54.280
And what this means is that you've really intuitively

09:54.280 --> 09:57.360
understand the magnitude of what could be coming

09:57.360 --> 10:00.560
around the corner if the stuff actually continues to work.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.520
The amount of automation that we can potentially have

10:02.520 --> 10:05.320
in both the digital space and the physical space.

10:05.320 --> 10:06.280
Now, I don't know about you,

10:06.280 --> 10:08.240
but I actually find this picture kind of bleak.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.480
This is what came out when I put a bunch of the

10:10.480 --> 10:13.680
last few minutes of talk into an image generator.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.840
And I don't actually like this picture.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.160
I think we can do better.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.440
And we have a few thousand people here.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.480
You're about to enter the industry

10:21.480 --> 10:23.200
and you're gonna be working on a lot of this technology

10:23.200 --> 10:24.200
and you're gonna be shaping it

10:24.200 --> 10:27.760
and you'll have some active sort of power over it.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.720
So I don't know, maybe we want this

10:28.720 --> 10:30.080
to look something like this.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.080
I mean, this is what I would like.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.400
So this is humans, animals, and nature,

10:34.400 --> 10:36.320
coexisting in harmony.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.360
But secretly, this is actually a high tech society

10:39.360 --> 10:40.880
and there are robots and quadcopters

10:40.880 --> 10:42.480
and there's a ton of automation,

10:42.480 --> 10:45.920
but it's hidden away and it's not sort of like in your face.

10:45.920 --> 10:49.040
And so maybe this is something that we want instead.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.680
And you should feel a lot of agency

10:50.680 --> 10:52.680
over what you want the future to be like

10:52.680 --> 10:54.200
because you're gonna build it.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.320
So maybe we can agree right now

10:55.320 --> 10:57.200
that this is better than the previous picture.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.960
But I don't know about you, but I would hope so

10:58.960 --> 11:01.480
because I'm gonna be living in that future, I think.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.880
So the question for this hackathon,

11:03.880 --> 11:06.040
I mean, a lot of you have worked on a real,

11:06.040 --> 11:08.800
a bunch of really cool projects over the last day or two.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.160
And the question is how do we go from hacking

11:11.160 --> 11:15.080
to actually changing the world and building this future,

11:15.080 --> 11:16.680
whatever that may be for you?

11:16.680 --> 11:18.280
And so what I thought I would do in this talk

11:18.280 --> 11:20.800
is go over maybe like my last 15 years or so

11:20.800 --> 11:21.960
in the industry.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.160
And I think I had a bit of a window

11:24.160 --> 11:27.280
into how projects become real role change.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.800
And I have some takeaways and things like that

11:28.800 --> 11:30.600
and that I maybe wanted to talk about.

11:31.520 --> 11:35.120
So the first thing that I find really incredible

11:35.120 --> 11:38.280
is how projects that are sometimes very small projects

11:38.280 --> 11:40.560
like little snowballs can actually like snowball

11:40.560 --> 11:41.920
into really big projects.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.000
And just how incredible that is to watch.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.940
So as an example, I have my fair share of hackathons

11:46.940 --> 11:48.620
like I mentioned, these are some projects

11:48.620 --> 11:50.440
from a long time ago that I worked on

11:50.440 --> 11:52.240
over the last 15 years or so.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.480
So I had a little Rubik's Cube color extractor.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.680
I put up some game programming tutorials on YouTube

11:57.680 --> 12:00.200
like 13 years ago and tried to teach people

12:00.200 --> 12:01.680
programming for games.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.120
I had a video games and a lot of them.

12:04.120 --> 12:07.280
I had this like kind of janky neuro evolution simulator

12:07.280 --> 12:09.480
which was kind of interesting.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.200
And unsurprisingly, not all of these projects

12:12.200 --> 12:13.360
actually go on to snowball.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.920
A lot of this is just exploration, you're tinkering.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.200
And so actually these three projects

12:17.200 --> 12:18.720
didn't really go anywhere for me.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.280
I wouldn't say that it was really wasted work.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.640
It was just like it didn't add up to and didn't snowball

12:22.640 --> 12:24.600
but it was still like helping me along the way.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.200
I'll come back to that later.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.040
But the game programming tutorials actually ended up

12:28.040 --> 12:29.840
snowballing for me in a certain way

12:29.840 --> 12:32.440
because that led me from game programming tutorials

12:32.440 --> 12:34.800
to a bunch of Rubik's Cube videos actually

12:34.800 --> 12:36.760
that became kind of popular at the time.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.680
And this kind of sparked an interest in teaching for me.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.000
And then when I was a PhD student at Stanford,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.840
I got to teach this class CS231N

12:45.840 --> 12:47.360
and got to develop it and teach it.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.280
And this was the first big deep learning class at Stanford.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.800
And a lot of people have gone on to like this.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.880
And then after that, I ended up making another YouTube channel

12:55.880 --> 12:59.640
which is my zero to hero series for deep learning and LLMs.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.440
So a lot of people like that as well.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.200
And then on top of that, continuing to snowball,

13:03.200 --> 13:05.200
the project that I'm currently very interested in

13:05.200 --> 13:07.600
is this next class and what it could look like

13:07.600 --> 13:08.960
and how I can make it better.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.160
And I'm calling that LLM101N.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.080
And it's about building a storyteller,

13:13.080 --> 13:14.600
something like kind of a chat GPT

13:14.600 --> 13:16.680
that you can work with to generate stories.

13:16.680 --> 13:19.520
And the idea is you build everything from scratch

13:19.520 --> 13:21.800
from basic prerequisites all the way to like

13:21.800 --> 13:24.880
kind of a chat GPT clone in the domain of storytelling.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.200
And building that from scratch,

13:26.200 --> 13:28.440
I think will be really instructive, could be really fun.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.880
I only published this on GitHub like two or three days ago.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.560
So it's pretty raw and still very much in the early stages.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.840
But I'm really excited for it.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.320
And this for me is an example of a snowball.

13:37.320 --> 13:40.160
It started with like 13 years ago, a little game programming.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.600
And I'm working on a course

13:41.600 --> 13:43.600
that I think will be really interesting.

13:45.080 --> 13:45.920
Thank you.

13:45.920 --> 13:51.160
Another example from my life, I think,

13:51.160 --> 13:53.360
is the snowball that I've witnessed with OpenAI.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.880
So as was briefly mentioned,

13:54.880 --> 13:58.120
I was a founding member researcher of OpenAI.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.600
And so I was there seven years ago.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.240
These are some images that are public

14:01.240 --> 14:04.960
of what it was like working out of Greg's apartment,

14:04.960 --> 14:06.000
like eight of us.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.200
And OpenAI was founded to be kind of like

14:08.200 --> 14:10.120
a counterbalance to Google.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.600
And Google was like this gorilla,

14:11.600 --> 14:13.680
with 70 billion free cash flow.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.240
And back then, Google employed

14:15.240 --> 14:18.200
like half of the AI research industry almost.

14:18.200 --> 14:23.240
So it was kind of like an interesting setup, I would say.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.080
And we were just like eight people with a laptop.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.600
So that was really interesting.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.840
And very similar to my background,

14:27.840 --> 14:31.280
OpenAI ended up exploring a large number of projects internally.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.840
We hired some really good people.

14:32.840 --> 14:35.120
And many of them didn't go too far,

14:35.120 --> 14:37.360
but some of them really did work.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.320
And so as an example, here's a project

14:39.320 --> 14:42.840
that was in an early stage, a very small snowball

14:43.160 --> 14:44.840
in the early history of OpenAI.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.120
Someone worked on a Reddit chatbot.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.680
And if you come by their desk and you're like,

14:49.680 --> 14:50.960
what does this look like when someone's working

14:50.960 --> 14:52.000
on a Reddit chatbot?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.600
We're trying to compete with Google.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.360
And you're working on a Reddit chatbot.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.440
Like we should be doing something bigger.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.360
And so it's very easy to dismiss these small snowballs,

15:01.360 --> 15:02.440
because they're so fragile.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.720
Right, these projects are so fragile in the beginning.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.000
But actually this Reddit chatbot,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.160
and by the way, don't read too much

15:07.160 --> 15:08.200
into the specific details.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.000
These are kind of like random screenshots,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.440
just for illustration.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.720
But this was a Reddit chatbot.

15:12.760 --> 15:13.760
And it looked naive.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.200
But actually Reddit chatbot, what is that?

15:16.200 --> 15:17.560
It's a language model.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.280
And it happens to be trained on Reddit.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.000
But actually you could train a language model

15:21.000 --> 15:23.120
on any arbitrary data, not just Reddit.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.600
And when the transformer came out,

15:24.600 --> 15:27.600
this was spun into something that worked much better.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.000
And then the domain was expanded

15:29.000 --> 15:30.880
from just Reddit to many other web pages.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.760
And suddenly you get GPT-1, GPT-2, 3, 4,

15:33.760 --> 15:35.400
and then you get GPT-4O.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.080
So actually this Reddit chatbot

15:37.080 --> 15:39.320
that was so easy to dismiss,

15:39.320 --> 15:41.720
actually like ended up leading a snowballing

15:41.720 --> 15:44.240
into GPT-4O, which we currently think of as this like,

15:44.240 --> 15:45.840
change in the computing paradigm.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.680
And you can talk to it, it's amazing.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.200
So it's really incredible for me to have witnessed

15:49.200 --> 15:52.200
some of those, I guess, snowballs.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.360
And today opening out, of course, is worth,

15:54.360 --> 15:56.880
maybe somewhere just below $100 billion or something like that.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.760
So really incredible,

15:58.760 --> 16:02.040
incredible to see some of these snowballs in practice.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.960
So I would say a lot of you over the last two days

16:04.960 --> 16:07.800
have also worked on small projects, small snowballs maybe.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.000
And it's really incredible to me

16:09.000 --> 16:11.240
that some of them probably won't go anywhere,

16:11.240 --> 16:13.200
but probably some of them actually will.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.400
And you should continue the momentum of your projects

16:16.400 --> 16:18.560
and maybe they can add up to a really big snowball

16:18.560 --> 16:20.560
and that's really incredible to watch.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.720
The next thing I wanted to briefly talk about is

16:23.720 --> 16:25.000
this concept of 10,000 hours

16:25.000 --> 16:27.520
that was popularized by Malcolm Gladwell, I think.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.240
I actually am quite a big believer in it.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.200
And I think that to a very large extent,

16:31.200 --> 16:33.560
success comes from just repeated practice

16:33.560 --> 16:34.840
and just a huge amount of it.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.160
And you should be very willing to put in those 10,000 hours

16:37.160 --> 16:38.920
and just literally just count.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.000
Don't be too nervous about what am I working about?

16:41.040 --> 16:42.640
Am I succeeding or failing, et cetera.

16:42.640 --> 16:43.920
Just do simple bean counting

16:43.920 --> 16:45.640
of how many hours you're gonna, you're doing

16:45.640 --> 16:46.960
and everything adds up.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.560
Even the projects that I failed at

16:48.560 --> 16:50.040
and didn't snowball into anything,

16:50.040 --> 16:53.840
those add to my counter of the number of hours I've spent

16:53.840 --> 16:56.680
developing my expertise and getting into an empowered state

16:56.680 --> 16:58.920
of being able to take on these projects with confidence

16:58.920 --> 17:00.240
and getting them to work.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.600
So a few examples of that.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.640
I made this like really janky website a few weeks ago.

17:05.640 --> 17:06.880
This was a weekend project

17:06.880 --> 17:09.320
and it's called awesomemovies.life.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.520
And you can visit it.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.720
I think it still works, I'm not 100% sure.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.800
I wouldn't recommend you go there.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.320
It's trying to be a movie recommendation engine

17:16.320 --> 17:18.200
because I was trying to figure out what to watch

17:18.200 --> 17:20.080
on that Saturday and then I was like, okay,

17:20.080 --> 17:22.440
I need to build myself a movie recommendation engine.

17:22.440 --> 17:25.120
So I put this up and one of the tweets

17:25.120 --> 17:27.840
that was replied to mine was, wow, that's so cool

17:27.840 --> 17:29.920
that you got this to work in the weekend.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.200
And I was kind of reflecting on that at the time

17:33.200 --> 17:36.440
because it wasn't as amazing to me.

17:36.440 --> 17:37.880
And the reason for that was that

17:37.880 --> 17:39.640
what this person is not seeing

17:39.720 --> 17:41.560
is that this is my 20th time

17:41.560 --> 17:43.760
like making a website like this.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.680
So I see all the steps that I was gonna follow.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.840
Okay, I need a linode, I need a flask server,

17:47.840 --> 17:50.920
I'm gonna write some of this JavaScript style sheets,

17:50.920 --> 17:53.080
HTML, I'm gonna spin this up together.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.240
I need to scrape all these web pages,

17:55.240 --> 17:58.880
I need to extract TFIDF vectors, I need to train SVM.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.160
And all of these things are things

18:00.160 --> 18:02.000
I've already done before 20 times.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.680
I already have code snippets lying around

18:03.680 --> 18:06.520
from previous projects and I'm just remixing what I have

18:06.520 --> 18:08.000
and I've already done all of this.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.120
And so remixing everything into a new form

18:10.120 --> 18:11.400
isn't actually that much work

18:11.400 --> 18:13.000
and allowed me to put this up over the weekend

18:13.000 --> 18:14.520
and it's not that crazy.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.160
And this only comes from expertise,

18:16.160 --> 18:18.680
this only comes from having done it 20 times

18:18.680 --> 18:21.080
and you can do this so confidently.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.600
The next example I would say in my life

18:22.600 --> 18:24.160
was a Tesla autopilot.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.780
So I was hired to lead the computer vision team

18:27.780 --> 18:30.840
at Tesla autopilot about seven or eight years ago.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.040
And one of the first things I did actually

18:33.040 --> 18:36.160
when I joined the team was I basically ended up rewriting

18:36.160 --> 18:39.080
the computer vision deep learning network,

18:39.080 --> 18:42.200
training code base from scratch in PyTorch

18:42.200 --> 18:44.840
in some of the first few months that I entered the team.

18:44.840 --> 18:47.140
And I sort of rewrote the whole thing from scratch

18:47.140 --> 18:50.000
and that ended up being a kernel of what it is now.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.040
And I think to some extent,

18:52.040 --> 18:54.240
to some people that looked impressive at the time,

18:54.240 --> 18:57.080
but for me it wasn't because I was coming from my PhD

18:57.080 --> 18:59.920
and I spent five years doing stuff like that

18:59.920 --> 19:01.880
and I knew exactly what needs to go into there.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.120
I need my training set, my evaluation sets,

19:04.120 --> 19:06.040
I need my training loop in PyTorch,

19:06.080 --> 19:10.920
I need my sort of configs, I need my log directories,

19:10.920 --> 19:13.400
I need to bring in a ResNet, I need to put in detection,

19:13.400 --> 19:15.600
we're doing a regression classification.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.520
And so the whole thing,

19:16.520 --> 19:18.080
like I'm anticipating all the steps

19:18.080 --> 19:19.720
and that only comes from experience,

19:19.720 --> 19:21.960
that only comes from having done it 20 times before.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.760
And so I think this makes a huge difference

19:23.760 --> 19:25.480
and things that look impressive

19:25.480 --> 19:27.120
are maybe much less impressive to you

19:27.120 --> 19:28.680
if you've done it 20 times before.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.440
So really try to get to this point

19:30.440 --> 19:32.080
where you have your 10,000 hours,

19:32.080 --> 19:36.000
it makes a huge difference and just, yeah, that's it.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.640
By the way, 10,000 hours,

19:38.640 --> 19:40.640
if you're doing six hours per day,

19:40.640 --> 19:43.120
I think this works out to about five years.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.920
So it's about a length of a PhD

19:44.920 --> 19:47.720
that you need to develop expertise in an area.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.360
So I think it's roughly correct

19:49.360 --> 19:51.520
that that works out to about a PhD length.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.160
The other thing that I found is actually quite useful

19:55.160 --> 19:57.520
is to keep the dopamine flowing,

19:57.520 --> 20:00.880
be aware of your psychology, your brain, how it works,

20:00.880 --> 20:04.280
and what it needs to keep going and how to keep inspired.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.640
And so in particular, your brain is a reward machine

20:06.640 --> 20:09.200
and it wants rewards and you need to give it rewards.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.040
So what is a good way to give it rewards?

20:11.040 --> 20:13.960
And in my practice, it is by doing projects

20:13.960 --> 20:16.840
and work on projects and continue publishing them.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.680
And so here I have a webpage snippet

20:18.680 --> 20:21.120
of some of the projects I have worked on in the past

20:21.120 --> 20:23.320
and these are hackathon projects and random projects

20:23.320 --> 20:24.160
and not all of them are good,

20:24.160 --> 20:26.240
some of them are not quite good, et cetera.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.560
But what I love about project is a number of things.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.920
Number one, I love that projects get you to work

20:31.920 --> 20:34.480
on something end-to-end and depth-wise.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.080
Like normally when you go to classes,

20:36.080 --> 20:38.000
you're learning in a breath-wise fashion.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
You're learning a lot of stuff

20:39.000 --> 20:41.200
just in case you might need it in the future.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.480
Well, when you're working on a project,

20:42.480 --> 20:44.560
you know what you need and you're learning it on demand

20:44.560 --> 20:46.080
and you're just trying to get it to work.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.080
So I think it's a very different mode of learning

20:49.080 --> 20:51.320
that really complements the breath-wise learning

20:51.320 --> 20:52.320
and it's very important.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.920
So I 100% encourage people to work on projects.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.620
The other thing is putting them up

20:56.620 --> 20:59.820
is actually also like a really good Jedi mind trick

20:59.820 --> 21:01.160
in my experience.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.720
The reason for that is that if you're gonna put something up,

21:03.720 --> 21:04.880
you're thinking about all the people

21:04.880 --> 21:06.040
who are gonna be looking at it,

21:06.040 --> 21:08.000
your friends and teammates and family

21:08.000 --> 21:10.280
and future employers, et cetera.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.840
And so that really increases the bar for your own work

21:13.840 --> 21:15.560
and it makes you work harder

21:15.560 --> 21:16.680
because they're gonna be looking at it

21:16.680 --> 21:18.720
and you feel shame if it was crappy.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.840
And so you work much harder

21:19.840 --> 21:22.040
and you're gonna go that extra mile to make it really good

21:22.040 --> 21:24.800
and that really, really helps.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.360
And lastly, when other people are looking at your projects,

21:27.360 --> 21:28.400
you're gonna get that reward

21:28.400 --> 21:30.960
because they like it, they appreciate it, they fork it,

21:30.960 --> 21:32.040
they work on top of it.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.280
And so that feels good to your brain.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.760
And so the way that this comes together is

21:36.760 --> 21:39.120
you are getting your dopamine, you feel good.

21:39.120 --> 21:42.120
That way you can build up to 10,000 hours of experience

21:42.120 --> 21:44.040
and that's what helps you a lot.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.080
Snowball your projects from a small snowball

21:47.080 --> 21:48.440
all the way to a really big one

21:48.440 --> 21:50.920
and actually make change in the world.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.760
So in summary, that's I think how it works

21:53.760 --> 21:57.720
like on a high level and the message is just keep hacking.

21:57.720 --> 21:58.560
That's it.

21:58.560 --> 22:03.560
And then hopefully, this is the future

22:07.440 --> 22:08.280
that we're gonna build together

22:08.280 --> 22:09.480
when we snowball all of our stuff

22:09.480 --> 22:10.720
or something like that,

22:10.720 --> 22:13.280
but not the first picture I showed, hopefully.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.680
And that's it, thank you.

22:14.680 --> 22:15.520
Thank you.

22:20.020 --> 22:22.360
Andre Karparthi, everybody.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.520
Thank you, Andre, that was awesome.

22:24.520 --> 22:25.600
Thank you, thank you.

22:26.440 --> 22:31.560
All right, let's get to those pitches.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.520
The grand prize, coming up,

22:33.520 --> 22:35.880
you're gonna hear eight pitches by eight projects

22:35.880 --> 22:39.240
filtered through 290 submissions.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.320
Narrow it down to eight

22:40.320 --> 22:42.460
so you're all gonna see some cool stuff.

22:42.460 --> 22:45.520
The grand prize is $25,000 investment

22:45.520 --> 22:48.440
and actual term sheet from the Berkeley Skydeck Fund.

22:48.440 --> 22:52.040
They must commit to hacking all summer on their project

22:52.040 --> 22:54.000
and they must appropriately form,

22:54.000 --> 22:55.680
of course, a legal entity.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.320
How do you get money otherwise?

22:57.320 --> 23:00.720
All right, I would like to now tell you briefly

23:00.720 --> 23:02.640
about how this is gonna go.

23:02.640 --> 23:05.960
Eight projects, as I said, three minute pitch.

23:05.960 --> 23:06.920
You guys ready?

23:06.920 --> 23:07.840
Three minutes?

23:07.840 --> 23:09.640
Yes, they're ready.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.120
The judges will then provide three minutes of feedback

23:13.120 --> 23:15.440
and then after all the pitches,

23:15.440 --> 23:19.520
the grand judges will go and deliberate and pick a winner.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.540
Well, we show you some other cool stuff.

23:21.540 --> 23:24.380
All right, I would like to introduce now

23:24.380 --> 23:26.380
to great applause, everybody, please,

23:26.380 --> 23:29.340
because we have an incredible panel of judges.

23:29.340 --> 23:30.900
We are so pleased to have them.

23:30.900 --> 23:33.340
Please welcome our first judge, Brian Boardley,

23:33.340 --> 23:35.660
with the Berkeley Skydeck Fund.

23:35.660 --> 23:36.820
Welcome, Brian.

23:38.780 --> 23:41.300
Marcy Vu with Greycroft.

23:41.300 --> 23:42.620
Welcome, Marcy.

23:45.980 --> 23:49.620
Namdi Eregbulam with Lightspeed.

23:49.620 --> 23:50.700
Welcome, Namdi.

23:52.540 --> 23:55.220
Irving Sue with Mayfield Fund.

23:55.220 --> 23:56.500
Welcome, Irving.

23:59.420 --> 24:01.940
Kurt Kuitzer, UC Berkeley faculty

24:01.940 --> 24:03.500
and serial entrepreneur.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.620
Welcome, Kurt.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.060
And Mark Nitzberg, Berkeley faculty

24:08.060 --> 24:09.780
and director of the UC Berkeley Center

24:09.780 --> 24:12.180
for Human Compatible AI.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.580
Thank you, judges.

24:15.860 --> 24:18.060
All right, we got eight startups.

24:18.060 --> 24:20.500
Warming up backstage.

24:20.540 --> 24:22.740
Let's give them a little drum roll.

24:22.740 --> 24:24.900
Let's give them a little drum roll.

24:24.900 --> 24:26.060
We can get them going.

24:26.060 --> 24:28.140
I first have to hear if the slide's up.

24:28.140 --> 24:29.500
The slide is up first.

24:29.500 --> 24:30.740
Are you ready?

24:30.740 --> 24:31.580
You ready?

24:32.460 --> 24:34.020
Are you ready?

24:34.020 --> 24:34.940
Yes!

24:34.940 --> 24:37.460
Please give everybody a warm round of applause.

24:37.460 --> 24:38.780
They've been up all night hacking

24:38.780 --> 24:40.100
and they're ready to share with you.

24:40.100 --> 24:42.780
Please welcome the first project, Revision.

24:42.780 --> 24:44.740
Come on out, come on out, Revision.

24:44.740 --> 24:45.580
Yes, Danica!

24:53.740 --> 24:55.020
Yes, the mic.

24:55.020 --> 24:55.940
That'd be helpful.

24:58.020 --> 24:58.980
Yeah, thank you.

24:58.980 --> 25:00.780
So good evening, everyone.

25:00.780 --> 25:04.020
It's my pleasure here on behalf of my team also

25:04.020 --> 25:06.020
for the Revision project.

25:06.020 --> 25:07.260
And my name is Danica.

25:07.260 --> 25:09.580
I'm a rising senior studying computer science

25:09.580 --> 25:10.620
at UC Berkeley.

25:10.620 --> 25:12.420
We have masters of design students

25:12.420 --> 25:14.220
as well as data science students on our team.

25:14.300 --> 25:17.580
And we're really excited to tell you about our project.

25:17.580 --> 25:19.860
So our project, we're focusing on building

25:19.860 --> 25:22.940
an AI co-pilot tool for STEM textbook authors

25:22.940 --> 25:25.340
capable of detecting and mitigating bias

25:25.340 --> 25:28.740
in textbooks to create inclusive education content.

25:28.740 --> 25:31.180
And there is a reason why we're doing this.

25:31.180 --> 25:33.740
When considering overall representation of scientists

25:33.740 --> 25:38.740
across textbooks, only 13.1% were women

25:38.780 --> 25:42.300
compared to 86.9% men in a 2020 study

25:42.300 --> 25:45.060
that featured seven of the most frequently used

25:45.060 --> 25:47.820
biology textbooks within the US.

25:47.820 --> 25:50.300
And on average, people of color only appear

25:50.300 --> 25:53.100
every 320 pages of text, while white figures

25:53.100 --> 25:57.460
observed every 24 pages across 10 college STEM textbooks

25:57.460 --> 26:00.060
published between 2016 and 2020.

26:01.180 --> 26:03.620
So we thought about this problem deep and hard

26:03.620 --> 26:05.220
and it has been something that I've seen

26:05.220 --> 26:06.700
from my personal studies.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.660
And starting from elementary school to middle school,

26:08.660 --> 26:11.780
we constantly see different examples of word problems

26:11.780 --> 26:14.340
in other situations where text is always there.

26:14.340 --> 26:17.220
And it's not always reflective of the actual true history.

26:17.220 --> 26:19.540
And this research has been done by numerous scientists

26:19.540 --> 26:21.260
who have gone through this process

26:21.260 --> 26:23.620
of identifying people creating databases,

26:23.620 --> 26:25.420
but there is just no current fix that,

26:25.420 --> 26:28.500
and no one is really hoping to create this problem,

26:28.500 --> 26:31.780
but there is no current fix that helps address this problem.

26:31.780 --> 26:33.580
So the textbook companies actually

26:33.580 --> 26:36.620
is who our team identified as our buying customer.

26:36.620 --> 26:39.340
The current revision process actually takes six to 12 months

26:39.340 --> 26:41.380
of a committee of five or more full-time employees

26:41.380 --> 26:42.540
working on bias checks.

26:42.540 --> 26:44.820
And the issue here is that employees

26:44.820 --> 26:46.780
are actually not experts on their topic.

26:46.780 --> 26:49.380
They also bring in their personal biases as well.

26:49.380 --> 26:52.300
So our tool would come in right in between the writing

26:52.300 --> 26:57.100
and revising part of this entire cycle

26:57.100 --> 27:00.180
that developers go through when writing textbooks.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.540
So again, here is our competitor analysis.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.940
I'm sure many of you have used Turnitin or Grammarly

27:05.940 --> 27:07.860
when you're submitting even essays.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.780
And we really think that there needs to be

27:09.780 --> 27:11.900
an additional check here for bias

27:11.900 --> 27:14.980
and checking gender, racial, political, and other biases

27:14.980 --> 27:17.540
and making this process affordable and automatic.

27:17.540 --> 27:22.540
So it's not a costly process for anyone.

27:22.860 --> 27:24.660
And throughout this process,

27:24.660 --> 27:26.700
we're addressing supply chain diversity.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.380
So starting from a younger age,

27:28.380 --> 27:30.460
the elementary school students could be able

27:30.460 --> 27:32.580
to use textbooks that truly reflect

27:32.580 --> 27:35.380
the true history as well as themselves.

27:35.380 --> 27:36.940
And here is our prototype.

27:36.940 --> 27:40.580
So we have our text box here on the left side of the screen

27:40.580 --> 27:42.860
where you get to show in real time

27:42.860 --> 27:44.780
the examples of some sort of text

27:44.780 --> 27:47.420
that a writer is creating at the moment.

27:47.420 --> 27:49.500
And on the right, we have an overall score

27:49.500 --> 27:52.700
and the bias checks for different categories.

27:52.700 --> 27:54.820
And we're using machine learning models on the back end

27:54.820 --> 27:57.620
to actually identify as well as LLMs.

27:58.740 --> 28:03.700
And I'm not sure if I can play the prototype, but, oh.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.020
Okay, yeah, it does play.

28:05.060 --> 28:07.940
So essentially you can click through the different links

28:07.940 --> 28:09.660
to see the breakdown.

28:09.660 --> 28:12.140
And once you actually highlight one of these,

28:12.140 --> 28:16.060
we are also adding in an API through a couple

28:16.060 --> 28:19.500
of the sponsors here, such as Hume API and more,

28:19.500 --> 28:22.940
to actually identify emotional analysis as well

28:22.940 --> 28:24.540
in the textbook writing.

28:24.540 --> 28:25.700
And in addition to this,

28:25.700 --> 28:27.100
we're hoping to build a chat bot

28:27.100 --> 28:30.780
that can actually help you also bring in databases

28:30.780 --> 28:33.060
from the unrecognized scientists

28:33.060 --> 28:36.140
and being able to sort of represent it.

28:36.140 --> 28:38.780
Because bias actually exists in three different ways.

28:38.780 --> 28:41.300
One of them is through actual text

28:41.300 --> 28:45.420
such as representing firefighters would be nicer

28:45.420 --> 28:46.900
than saying fireman.

28:46.900 --> 28:51.180
And the other way is the entire tone and emotional analysis,

28:51.180 --> 28:53.140
which is why our team used Hume API

28:53.140 --> 28:56.220
to actually detect that emotional component.

28:56.220 --> 28:58.220
And the third one is mitigating bias.

28:58.220 --> 29:01.220
So we also considered adding in the chat bot.

29:01.260 --> 29:04.380
So say, for example, if you want to highlight scientists

29:04.380 --> 29:07.220
that are like, for example, contributing to physics,

29:07.220 --> 29:09.660
you wouldn't just say list a few male scientists

29:09.660 --> 29:10.500
and call it a day.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.540
We would also suggest equivalent contributions

29:12.540 --> 29:14.740
of female scientists as well.

29:14.740 --> 29:16.860
So please join me and our team

29:16.860 --> 29:19.580
in revisioning our future of education and work.

29:19.580 --> 29:20.420
Thank you.

29:20.420 --> 29:30.260
So I think everybody in communication today,

29:30.260 --> 29:32.820
nonprofit or profit is concerned about diversity.

29:32.820 --> 29:35.460
So it seems like you have a much larger market

29:35.460 --> 29:40.540
than just textbook educators.

29:40.540 --> 29:43.580
Also a comment on kind of like market sizing and whatnot.

29:43.580 --> 29:45.820
I would think about, you know, potential ways

29:45.820 --> 29:47.140
you could expand the market here,

29:47.140 --> 29:49.540
because the number of people who are involved

29:49.540 --> 29:51.980
in writing textbooks is a relatively small group.

29:51.980 --> 29:53.580
But one way to think about it is like maybe

29:53.580 --> 29:56.180
in this new era of AI generated content,

29:56.180 --> 29:58.540
a much wider array of people can be part

29:58.580 --> 30:00.580
of this textbook generation process.

30:00.580 --> 30:01.740
So that's one thing.

30:01.740 --> 30:03.740
And then I would also maybe consider selling directly

30:03.740 --> 30:05.260
to the consumers of textbooks.

30:05.260 --> 30:07.540
Because in some sense, the bias we're talking about

30:07.540 --> 30:09.340
is internalized on that side of the equation,

30:09.340 --> 30:11.100
not on the manufacturer side.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.620
And so they could be insensitive there

30:12.620 --> 30:14.580
for want to pay for something like this.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.420
Yeah, definitely.

30:15.420 --> 30:16.380
That's something we're considering.

30:16.380 --> 30:18.740
So like the textbook would be our official bias

30:18.740 --> 30:19.820
that we're marketing to,

30:19.820 --> 30:22.180
but eventually it would be more of like a grammarly checker

30:22.180 --> 30:24.540
type of tool that anyone can use.

30:24.540 --> 30:26.340
Yeah, I had a similar comment on TAM

30:26.420 --> 30:27.580
and market opportunity.

30:27.580 --> 30:31.020
And as you think about just how a textbook

30:31.020 --> 30:32.540
gets put into production,

30:32.540 --> 30:34.820
that if you actually had it as a tool for

30:34.820 --> 30:37.460
whether it's news or other areas,

30:37.460 --> 30:39.420
you'd have more velocity,

30:39.420 --> 30:42.100
both in terms of getting the data to improve your models,

30:42.100 --> 30:44.660
but also greater impact.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.500
Yeah, I'll just, I'll just like as well.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.100
I mean, similar, I think everyone here

30:52.100 --> 30:54.820
is kind of hitting the theme of how do we think bigger?

30:54.820 --> 30:56.300
So even enterprises, right?

30:56.300 --> 30:58.140
Like companies sending out communications

30:58.140 --> 30:59.340
internally or externally.

30:59.340 --> 31:01.300
I know this, this, this problem exists everywhere.

31:01.300 --> 31:03.660
So that's kind of where my brain would go to.

31:06.580 --> 31:08.260
Okay, thank you.

31:08.260 --> 31:09.100
Thank you.

31:09.100 --> 31:09.940
Thank you.

31:09.940 --> 31:10.780
Thank you.

31:10.780 --> 31:11.620
Thank you.

31:16.420 --> 31:17.780
Whoops.

31:17.780 --> 31:18.900
Agent OS.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.540
Please welcome Agent OS.

31:26.380 --> 31:27.220
Hey there everyone.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.260
My name is Shashank.

31:28.260 --> 31:30.060
I'm here today with my friends,

31:30.060 --> 31:31.580
Uggum and Drew Buhuja,

31:31.580 --> 31:33.260
somewhere in the crowd over here.

31:33.260 --> 31:35.140
We built today Agent OS.

31:36.700 --> 31:37.940
Picture this.

31:37.940 --> 31:38.900
You work at a hair salon

31:38.900 --> 31:40.780
and you guys are bombarded every single day

31:40.780 --> 31:42.740
and every single year by your accounting

31:42.740 --> 31:45.060
and tax preparation qualms.

31:45.060 --> 31:46.620
These are things that are very hard to deal with

31:46.620 --> 31:48.220
and you've heard of tools like OpenAI,

31:48.220 --> 31:52.340
ChatGPT, LLM this, ChatGPT that, everything.

31:52.340 --> 31:53.580
But you have no clue where to start

31:53.580 --> 31:54.780
using these technologies.

31:54.820 --> 31:56.940
And that's no fault of your own.

31:56.940 --> 31:59.460
The current state of the technology right now

31:59.460 --> 32:02.540
is very bad at multi-functionary tasks.

32:02.540 --> 32:05.060
More so, it's very hard as an individual developer,

32:05.060 --> 32:06.740
sometimes even non-technical,

32:06.740 --> 32:09.780
to even get started with even the simplest automations

32:09.780 --> 32:12.340
or workflows or tools with such LLMs.

32:12.340 --> 32:15.220
Even engineers with years on years of experience

32:15.220 --> 32:18.340
in this space take tens of hundreds and hours

32:18.340 --> 32:20.020
and even thousands and thousands of dollars

32:20.020 --> 32:22.380
to even get started to build something.

32:22.420 --> 32:25.980
This is where Agent OS completely transforms the landscape.

32:25.980 --> 32:29.620
With Agent OS, you're able to create multi-agent workflows

32:29.620 --> 32:32.100
in a matter of seconds from natural language.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.500
What does that even mean?

32:33.500 --> 32:35.620
Take your average corporate org structure.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.300
You have your managers, you have your workers

32:37.300 --> 32:39.100
and sometimes you even have your interns.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.900
Everyone is really good at what they do.

32:40.900 --> 32:42.740
They have their tools, their skills.

32:42.740 --> 32:45.140
Let's say John is really good at charting

32:45.140 --> 32:46.380
and making PowerPoints.

32:46.380 --> 32:49.200
Let's say Steve is really good at Python coding.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.120
Everyone's really good at what they do.

32:51.120 --> 32:54.040
In this, you have a very collaborative working together

32:54.040 --> 32:55.880
to create this common solution

32:55.880 --> 32:57.720
for someone coming from higher up.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.000
That's how Agent OS was designed.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.560
Our engineers, Dhruv and Uggum,

33:01.560 --> 33:05.160
were able to replicate this human collaborative process

33:05.160 --> 33:07.680
to programmatically using LLMs.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.760
What does this do?

33:08.760 --> 33:11.140
This allows everyone from the common Joe

33:11.140 --> 33:13.000
all the way up to enterprise clients

33:13.000 --> 33:16.680
to be able to interact and use these multi-agent,

33:16.680 --> 33:18.880
agentic workflows in their day-to-day life

33:18.920 --> 33:21.240
to improve their quality of life or productivity,

33:21.240 --> 33:23.760
in all in a matter of seconds and a few sentences.

33:24.680 --> 33:27.040
Let's go back to the study of the hair salon.

33:27.040 --> 33:30.520
In the process of doing your taxes and accounting,

33:30.520 --> 33:31.760
you have multiple steps.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.440
You have your collection from your receipts

33:33.440 --> 33:35.960
and your invoices, you have calculating your cash flow,

33:35.960 --> 33:37.640
all the calculations you have to do,

33:37.640 --> 33:39.120
you have to manage your workers

33:39.120 --> 33:41.000
and then you also have to do your general summary.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.300
What about your insights for the year,

33:42.300 --> 33:44.320
how you were spending, what you were spending on

33:44.320 --> 33:46.160
and you have to also do a lot of clustering

33:46.160 --> 33:47.480
and analytics on this.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.400
This is a very complex workflow

33:49.400 --> 33:51.760
that's nearly impossible for modern-day LLMs

33:51.760 --> 33:53.480
at the current state to do right now.

33:53.480 --> 33:55.280
You can take chat, GPT, you ask it a question

33:55.280 --> 33:56.680
for even more than three things,

33:56.680 --> 33:58.060
it'll forget what the first thing was

33:58.060 --> 33:59.360
by the time you're at the second.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.680
It doesn't work that way.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.640
With AgentOS, this completely changes

34:02.640 --> 34:05.280
where you're able to have these complex workflows.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.640
Let's dive into another demo.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.760
So let's say I'm an analyst at JP Morgan

34:09.760 --> 34:12.400
and my boss tells me every morning I want a report

34:12.400 --> 34:17.080
of XYZ stock in the morning, a detailed report on paper.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.560
How do I do that?

34:18.560 --> 34:19.840
I use AgentOS.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.840
On this screen you can see a bunch of other complex

34:21.840 --> 34:25.080
use cases of multiple agents working together collaboratively

34:25.080 --> 34:27.400
but in the tool box, in the search bar,

34:27.400 --> 34:29.480
you can see the use case of the analyst.

34:29.480 --> 34:32.240
Here I have to do market research, livestock data,

34:32.240 --> 34:35.140
I have to search the internet, go on Yahoo Finance,

34:35.140 --> 34:36.360
then I have to create my analysis,

34:36.360 --> 34:38.600
technical analysis, qualitative analysis,

34:38.600 --> 34:41.080
then I have to do what my boss is telling me to do

34:41.080 --> 34:43.400
and after all of that I have to create charts,

34:43.400 --> 34:45.200
graphs and visualizations.

34:45.240 --> 34:47.840
Here you can build tools using natural language

34:47.840 --> 34:49.920
like the one right there that says write me a tool

34:49.920 --> 34:52.600
that fetches the meta stock price from Yahoo Finance.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.240
In a matter of seconds, the common Joe or anyone

34:55.240 --> 34:58.120
is able to create that tool, connect them to workers.

34:58.120 --> 35:00.360
You can think of workers as your everyday employees,

35:00.360 --> 35:03.520
agents, people that perform these actions using the tools

35:03.520 --> 35:05.320
and then connect them to super teams

35:05.320 --> 35:08.480
and these teams are able to, on the screen you see four

35:08.480 --> 35:11.160
but you can scale this up to 40, 400,

35:11.160 --> 35:14.440
basically complex, vertical and horizontal organizations

35:14.480 --> 35:16.720
that are able to perform complex decision making

35:16.720 --> 35:19.480
and complex analyses for anyone,

35:19.480 --> 35:20.760
from enterprise to consumer.

35:21.880 --> 35:22.800
What does this do?

35:22.800 --> 35:24.920
With a multi-agent, multi-team framework,

35:24.920 --> 35:27.240
this completely opens the landscape up for anyone

35:27.240 --> 35:29.840
and everyone to take on the power of LLMs

35:29.840 --> 35:32.720
into their own hands from natural language.

35:32.720 --> 35:35.280
Take your average farmer at a farmer's market.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.680
He's trying to create his marketing campaign

35:37.680 --> 35:39.680
for the upcoming farmer's market this Sunday.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.040
He has no clue where to start looking at his metrics,

35:42.040 --> 35:43.880
looking at the customers, looking at the weather

35:44.000 --> 35:46.960
and creating these brochures, papers, pamphlets and whatnot.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.560
With one line and one minute using Agent OS,

35:49.560 --> 35:51.760
he can create all the documentation he needs

35:51.760 --> 35:55.000
in order to enact this stuff and be able to perform successfully

35:55.000 --> 35:57.880
and continually grow his business at his farmer's market.

35:57.880 --> 36:00.440
Things like this are completely opened up with Agent OS

36:00.440 --> 36:03.120
and we hope to completely democratize the process

36:03.120 --> 36:06.320
of using LLMs at all scales, at all geographies

36:06.320 --> 36:09.400
and all use cases within sentences and seconds.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.240
Thank you.

36:10.240 --> 36:25.080
That's a compelling proposition.

36:25.080 --> 36:36.480
The one thing that I worry about is right now the agents are the LLMs,

36:36.520 --> 36:44.600
you know, performing these tasks and there's a certain question

36:44.600 --> 36:47.560
about the veracity and reliability of what they're doing.

36:47.560 --> 36:50.760
And so I think that in a future

36:50.760 --> 36:54.800
where we have that reliability, this would make perfect sense,

36:54.800 --> 37:00.280
but I would want to add a kind of tandem subject matter expert,

37:00.280 --> 37:05.320
maybe looking over the shoulder of each of the agents.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.680
I think next time I hear this pitch, I'd love to hear

37:07.680 --> 37:10.200
about the one market you're going to crush.

37:10.200 --> 37:14.720
It's hard for me to imagine serving a hairstylist one day

37:14.720 --> 37:18.120
and Morgan Stanley analysts the next.

37:18.120 --> 37:24.760
This is a huge opportunity and a big bold mission that you have.

37:24.760 --> 37:28.640
I would want to dig a bit deeper into your tech staff

37:28.640 --> 37:30.280
and the people you have on your team

37:30.280 --> 37:33.760
because these are really complex problems and issues

37:33.760 --> 37:40.360
and also agree that what would be your first area of focus

37:40.360 --> 37:45.320
because it's pretty broad and wide.

37:45.320 --> 37:48.480
I'll say I kind of like the broad focus and there's a lot

37:48.480 --> 37:52.640
of individual startups tackling each of these individual problems.

37:52.640 --> 37:56.080
If it's invoicing or research, it might be interesting to figure

37:56.080 --> 37:59.840
out how to like loop in all these other tools that are out there

37:59.840 --> 38:01.800
and really kind of just be like an interface layer

38:01.840 --> 38:06.600
and let these other companies solve the technical challenges.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.920
I think the value proposition of creating multi-agent workflows

38:09.920 --> 38:12.480
in a matter of seconds is really compelling.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.440
I think the next step would be trying to figure

38:14.440 --> 38:17.480
out how can you go from simply performing these tasks

38:17.480 --> 38:18.920
to becoming the best at these tasks.

38:18.920 --> 38:21.400
So for example, going after the outliers,

38:21.400 --> 38:23.560
sort of the thesis around coaching networks.

38:23.560 --> 38:26.600
Some startups do this and they do it better for like certain

38:26.600 --> 38:27.600
verticals and others.

38:27.600 --> 38:31.160
So I think doing more research around that could be really

38:31.160 --> 38:32.840
compelling.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.080
The only thing I would add is just think about, you know,

38:35.080 --> 38:37.560
enterprise security and how you solve for that.

38:37.560 --> 38:40.080
There's a lot of authenticates and authorization you're going

38:40.080 --> 38:41.240
to have to do for all these agents.

38:41.240 --> 38:45.680
So just have an answer for that.

38:45.680 --> 38:46.720
Well, yeah, thank you so much.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.360
Thank you, everyone.

38:48.360 --> 38:52.120
Thank you, Agent OS.

38:52.120 --> 38:54.480
All right, next up, Skyline.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.680
Come on out, Skyline.

38:56.680 --> 39:03.920
Hey, everyone.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.800
Hey, so my name is Rajan and I'm a first year student

39:06.800 --> 39:08.080
at the University of Waterloo

39:08.080 --> 39:09.720
and I study software engineering.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.440
And I fundamentally believe

39:11.440 --> 39:14.280
that cities shouldn't be static.

39:14.280 --> 39:17.080
They should optimize and scale for the people

39:17.080 --> 39:18.360
who inhabit them.

39:18.360 --> 39:19.600
And so we built Skyline.

39:19.600 --> 39:23.600
Skyline is an optimizer and it allows you

39:23.600 --> 39:26.440
to better understand how to model cities,

39:26.440 --> 39:30.880
using agents, and optimize things like traffic and transit

39:30.880 --> 39:34.240
to inherently increase mobility

39:34.240 --> 39:37.040
and reduce things like carbon emissions.

39:37.040 --> 39:40.320
So this is a very weird problem that we solved.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.520
But I want to walk through the case study of Los Angeles.

39:43.520 --> 39:46.360
So Los Angeles is one of the largest carbon emitters

39:46.360 --> 39:49.280
in North America, this most because of their transit,

39:49.280 --> 39:51.200
because of the amount of cars.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.920
And so what are ways in which we can optimize this?

39:53.960 --> 39:55.640
Well, let's look directly at the people

39:55.640 --> 39:57.440
who inhabit Los Angeles.

39:57.440 --> 40:00.320
We can extract census data, things like age.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.760
We can look at things like gender.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.280
We can look at things like income.

40:04.280 --> 40:06.320
We can find population density graphs.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.400
And using this information, we can start to find patterns.

40:09.400 --> 40:13.520
Specifically, what we did is we created 500 distinct agents.

40:13.520 --> 40:17.400
Each agent is a different citizen with different interests.

40:17.400 --> 40:18.800
And what we can do is we can give them

40:18.800 --> 40:21.040
each their own chain of thought.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.960
Each person here has their own day in their life.

40:23.960 --> 40:26.400
For example, this person is a very young,

40:26.400 --> 40:29.640
I believe this was a 22-year-old with a very large income.

40:29.640 --> 40:32.880
He's a long day at work, and after work, he goes to the gym.

40:32.880 --> 40:35.560
We can now reason about what this person may do

40:35.560 --> 40:38.280
and now model this on a map.

40:38.280 --> 40:40.400
Now, once we have how these different agents

40:40.400 --> 40:41.920
are moving around, what we can do

40:41.920 --> 40:44.520
is we can try and optimize things like transit.

40:44.520 --> 40:47.520
So what we do here is we have our own proximal policy

40:47.520 --> 40:50.720
analyzer, and this allows us to create simulations.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.440
What we believe to be the best way

40:52.440 --> 40:58.040
to understand how we can move around from any point A and B

40:58.040 --> 41:01.600
in the fastest way at the lowest carbon cost.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.240
We use our own carbon cost analysis mechanisms,

41:04.240 --> 41:06.760
our own machine learning models to better understand

41:06.760 --> 41:10.000
how we may be emitting carbon and how

41:10.000 --> 41:11.880
to reduce this through our transit.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.600
So this is a lot that is through you,

41:13.600 --> 41:15.680
and I think the best way for me to represent this to you

41:15.680 --> 41:16.760
is through a video.

41:16.760 --> 41:17.840
I hope this video loads.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.360
It's possible to play the video.

41:26.040 --> 41:28.480
So what we first do is we have an agent-based simulation.

41:28.480 --> 41:31.880
These are 500 distinct things in parallel that are running.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.840
Now they each go around throughout their day,

41:33.840 --> 41:35.760
and what we can do is we can define patterns

41:35.760 --> 41:37.200
in how they move around.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.120
Now the best part is what we can do

41:39.120 --> 41:41.560
is now that they're all back in their original position,

41:41.560 --> 41:44.120
we can start a generation of transit.

41:44.120 --> 41:46.400
And we're using these patterns to now generate

41:46.400 --> 41:48.920
live different transit systems that we

41:48.920 --> 41:50.720
believe to be the most optimal.

41:50.720 --> 41:54.280
So what Skyline is, we're not a company that

41:54.280 --> 41:56.280
does analysis of transit.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.640
We are a human modeling company, and that

41:58.640 --> 42:01.800
allows us to better understand and better predict

42:01.800 --> 42:03.480
how things around us will change and how

42:03.480 --> 42:06.880
it can optimize them using these patterns.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.480
Yeah, so that's Skyline.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.480
Happy to take any of the back.

42:11.480 --> 42:12.480
Thank you.

42:22.480 --> 42:22.980
Wow.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.760
I just want to observe that what you're

42:31.760 --> 42:36.640
doing in creating a sort of digital twin of a city

42:36.640 --> 42:44.680
is essentially the each citizen is

42:44.680 --> 42:49.760
being simulated using one of these really powerful,

42:49.760 --> 42:52.560
expensive things, a language model.

42:52.560 --> 42:58.120
And it will be probably an important step

42:58.120 --> 43:04.080
to draw from the language model some of the statistics that

43:04.080 --> 43:06.320
are actually fed in in the first place

43:06.320 --> 43:11.440
to make sure you're getting out something representative.

43:11.440 --> 43:14.480
But that's very impressive.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.520
Yeah, yeah, similar comment.

43:16.520 --> 43:18.920
I think there's all sorts of economic theory

43:18.920 --> 43:21.440
about agents and modeling their behavior

43:21.440 --> 43:22.600
and their values and whatnot.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.240
And the thing that usually gets you

43:24.240 --> 43:26.760
is the sort of heterogeneity across the population.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.920
And so making sure that that actually represents

43:28.920 --> 43:31.280
the populations being modeled is important.

43:31.280 --> 43:33.320
And then the other thing also related to value,

43:33.320 --> 43:35.560
I would think about it as just value capture

43:35.600 --> 43:37.120
for your own sake, because I feel like this

43:37.120 --> 43:40.920
is a category of software where the economic impact of this

43:40.920 --> 43:41.720
could be massive.

43:41.720 --> 43:44.640
But how much of that do you get to capture as a software renderer

43:44.640 --> 43:46.160
is less clear to me?

43:46.160 --> 43:49.480
But it's very interesting.

43:49.480 --> 43:52.800
I guess I would be curious about maybe some more nuanced

43:52.800 --> 43:57.320
enterprise use cases as well, if it's concerts or security

43:57.320 --> 43:58.640
or stadiums.

43:58.640 --> 44:01.400
So just thinking about are there more micro use cases

44:01.400 --> 44:05.120
that there's a more direct ROI with for this sort

44:05.200 --> 44:07.040
of modeling?

44:07.040 --> 44:09.440
Yeah, we tried to consider ourselves

44:09.440 --> 44:11.240
to be a human modeling software.

44:11.240 --> 44:13.800
And this is just one of the most visual applications,

44:13.800 --> 44:14.600
which is strength.

44:19.880 --> 44:20.760
Awesome, thank you so much.

44:20.760 --> 44:21.760
Thank you.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.000
Thank you.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.560
Thank you, Skyline.

44:25.560 --> 44:32.720
All right, next up, we have Spark.

44:32.720 --> 44:33.600
Please welcome Spark.

44:35.120 --> 44:39.840
Hi, how's everyone?

44:39.840 --> 44:41.200
How's Cali?

44:41.200 --> 44:43.400
We are Spark, and we're giving a voice

44:43.400 --> 44:47.360
to new entrepreneurs, young entrepreneurs.

44:47.360 --> 44:50.960
So let's admit it, cold calling is really hard.

44:50.960 --> 44:53.640
I mean, resources are hard to get.

44:53.640 --> 44:55.280
It's a steep learning curve.

44:55.280 --> 44:57.400
And getting attention is hard.

44:57.400 --> 44:59.680
If you've cold called someone, you know, they don't have time.

44:59.680 --> 45:02.000
They'll say, oh, sorry, call me back later.

45:02.000 --> 45:02.720
I mean, they're busy.

45:02.720 --> 45:03.400
Everyone's busy.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.320
We have things to do.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.560
So we have to figure out how can we

45:06.560 --> 45:09.960
earn the time of working people.

45:09.960 --> 45:11.760
There's existing solutions.

45:11.760 --> 45:14.600
It's long and arduous for trial and error.

45:14.600 --> 45:16.640
It's expensive for a sales coach.

45:16.640 --> 45:19.600
And finally, if you have a sales partner,

45:19.600 --> 45:23.320
chemistry isn't easy if you're just meeting them, right?

45:23.320 --> 45:24.640
Well, we have a process.

45:24.640 --> 45:27.720
You upload a transcript to our software.

45:27.720 --> 45:30.080
We go through and analyze the emotion.

45:30.080 --> 45:35.200
We aggregate this data, and we give you productive feedback.

45:35.200 --> 45:36.400
Who's our target market?

45:36.400 --> 45:38.000
Well, look around.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.600
You guys are our target market.

45:39.600 --> 45:42.480
People who are engineers, people who love to build,

45:42.480 --> 45:45.160
and say this weekend you made some sort of product

45:45.160 --> 45:46.200
you want to sell.

45:46.200 --> 45:49.540
You don't have much experience with sales or outreach.

45:49.540 --> 45:52.720
With our software, you can record your cold outreach,

45:52.720 --> 45:54.560
and we can tell you what you've done right

45:54.560 --> 45:57.440
and how you can improve to hopefully land your product

45:57.440 --> 45:59.840
where it needs to be.

45:59.840 --> 46:02.640
And later on, we want to expand to call centers and sales

46:02.640 --> 46:05.440
staffs, because we think we can spread this

46:05.440 --> 46:09.320
across an organization, and it can be highly profitable.

46:09.320 --> 46:14.680
We have usage-based tiering, so $0.75 a minute for 1,000 hours,

46:14.680 --> 46:18.480
going up to $0.40 for $10,000.

46:18.480 --> 46:20.880
So this is our software.

46:20.880 --> 46:22.960
And I want to tell you guys a story.

46:22.960 --> 46:26.060
I started being an entrepreneur around six months ago,

46:26.060 --> 46:28.960
and we made an AI body cam analysis startup.

46:28.960 --> 46:32.080
So I did 100 phone calls, 100 cold calls.

46:32.080 --> 46:36.720
I got no clients, 200, 300, 500, and 700.

46:36.720 --> 46:39.080
No one was responding to me.

46:39.080 --> 46:43.440
So by 800, I got actually three, and I realized something.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.460
The human brain is pretty amazing.

46:45.460 --> 46:47.320
We're able to pick up on patterns,

46:47.320 --> 46:49.920
but at the same time, it's kind of inefficient,

46:49.920 --> 46:52.920
because it took 800.

46:52.920 --> 46:56.480
Here, we look at the emotion between every single sentence,

46:56.480 --> 46:59.000
and we figure out spikes of emotion and decreasing

46:59.000 --> 47:00.360
emotions.

47:00.360 --> 47:03.040
We see that when we talk about security and data privacy

47:03.040 --> 47:06.600
with police officers, it shows an increase in their interest.

47:06.600 --> 47:09.600
And this was a trend among many conversations we had.

47:09.600 --> 47:14.640
So in our analysis page, we see in the top left

47:14.640 --> 47:18.320
that mentioning AI accuracy and efficiency, increased officer

47:18.320 --> 47:21.080
safety, and discussing cost savings

47:21.080 --> 47:24.160
really helped us when we were talking to officers,

47:24.160 --> 47:26.240
because we're some college students, right?

47:26.240 --> 47:29.240
We're dealing with some pretty confidential data.

47:29.240 --> 47:32.480
Bringing this up early really helped improve our rates.

47:32.480 --> 47:35.200
And the four things you see here in the corners

47:35.200 --> 47:38.240
are the different triggers we generated automatically

47:38.240 --> 47:40.320
based on the cold calls we had.

47:40.320 --> 47:45.280
So one is positive reactions, negative reactions,

47:45.280 --> 47:48.400
deescalating tense situations, and normalizing

47:48.400 --> 47:50.320
exciting situations.

47:50.320 --> 47:54.480
We also generate insights, too, based on whatever cold calling

47:54.480 --> 47:56.760
trends you make.

47:56.760 --> 48:00.320
We also have a rag, so you can upload your company knowledge,

48:00.320 --> 48:02.840
your target audience, and your pricing information.

48:02.840 --> 48:05.640
So if you make a mistake, don't worry, we got your back.

48:05.640 --> 48:08.480
We'll tell you, hey, maybe instead of saying this,

48:08.480 --> 48:10.760
you could have said this, because it might have helped you

48:10.760 --> 48:11.640
out a little bit.

48:14.080 --> 48:15.760
Sorry, my team picture isn't on here,

48:15.760 --> 48:18.720
but thank you to Tushar, and Nick, and Krishna.

48:18.720 --> 48:20.200
You guys were a great team.

48:20.200 --> 48:22.480
And I'm honored to be here representing you guys today.

48:22.480 --> 48:23.440
I'm open to feedback.

48:23.440 --> 48:33.120
I guess I need to be the first person

48:33.120 --> 48:37.920
to say that you're entering a pretty competitive market

48:37.920 --> 48:39.520
with other offerings here.

48:43.480 --> 48:45.000
I'll say something that stuck out to me

48:45.000 --> 48:47.840
was this idea of insights.

48:47.840 --> 48:50.720
But I think at an organization, there's

48:50.720 --> 48:52.800
going to be a sales team, and a marketing team,

48:52.840 --> 48:54.760
and an online web team.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.560
And those teams don't really talk to each other,

48:56.560 --> 48:58.680
so maybe it's interesting to think about how do you pull

48:58.680 --> 49:01.960
insights from one channel of sales or marketing

49:01.960 --> 49:03.920
and actually bring that into another channel.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.040
So maybe the insights from cold calling

49:06.040 --> 49:08.240
are actually influencing what's going on the website.

49:08.240 --> 49:12.320
Maybe there's some interesting spots of opportunity there.

49:12.320 --> 49:14.360
Yeah, I can actually talk about one facet of this.

49:14.360 --> 49:16.600
We want to explore deeply.

49:16.600 --> 49:17.720
I want to give you an example.

49:17.720 --> 49:19.960
Say we have three founders in the company, right?

49:19.960 --> 49:22.680
I have a first cold call with one person,

49:22.720 --> 49:24.720
and later on, my second co-founder

49:24.720 --> 49:27.040
wants to set up a warmer call in the future.

49:27.040 --> 49:29.600
And then my third founder wants to set up a third call.

49:29.600 --> 49:33.640
We want to build a profile for this client as they go along,

49:33.640 --> 49:35.280
so we can truly understand them.

49:35.280 --> 49:37.920
And also, we want to develop a profile on ourselves, too,

49:37.920 --> 49:39.960
so we can learn more about ourselves as we go

49:39.960 --> 49:43.840
and how we're behaving, make sure that we're learning as we go.

49:43.840 --> 49:47.800
So we're thinking, if we develop a CRM on top of this data

49:47.800 --> 49:50.600
that we leverage, then we can connect multiple teams

49:50.600 --> 49:53.320
and enable cross-functional benefit.

49:55.520 --> 49:56.800
Yeah, I had a similar comment.

49:56.800 --> 49:58.480
I think it would be really game-changing

49:58.480 --> 50:01.160
if, in addition to some of the real-time analyses

50:01.160 --> 50:03.120
your guys are doing around sentiment,

50:03.120 --> 50:07.560
where you can see the system with information on prior calls

50:07.560 --> 50:10.040
or this person's particular strengths and weaknesses

50:10.040 --> 50:13.320
and how they compliment those of the other people on the team

50:13.320 --> 50:17.200
and to really build a CRM, this knowledge graph around

50:17.200 --> 50:19.360
each person's strengths and weaknesses on the team

50:19.360 --> 50:21.240
to be able to better fine-tune the system.

50:21.240 --> 50:22.920
Yeah, thank you. You guys saw the analysis,

50:22.920 --> 50:26.440
but also, there's a long list of past conversations.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.600
You can actually go into every single conversation

50:28.600 --> 50:30.880
you've ever had and look at it deeply,

50:30.880 --> 50:33.600
the same way you did in the latest conversation.

50:34.920 --> 50:38.280
I would think about the full sales funnel.

50:38.280 --> 50:40.600
This is pretty deep down in it.

50:40.600 --> 50:42.760
And as you think about,

50:42.760 --> 50:45.560
where are you really going to be able to convert

50:45.560 --> 50:49.200
or where's the wedge that really matters?

50:49.200 --> 50:53.400
Because there's a lot that goes into converting a sale

50:53.400 --> 50:54.760
and it's not just the cold call.

50:54.760 --> 50:57.880
So is the issue, are you actually calling the right people?

50:57.880 --> 51:00.960
Or is the issue, are you actually speaking

51:00.960 --> 51:02.280
to the right decision-makers?

51:02.280 --> 51:05.840
So just thinking more broadly about that funnel

51:05.840 --> 51:09.400
and where you might actually be able to have the most impact

51:09.400 --> 51:14.400
and have the right wedge into the broader products we.

51:14.600 --> 51:15.800
Yeah, thanks.

51:16.760 --> 51:18.800
Thank you. Thank you.

51:18.800 --> 51:19.720
All right, thank you guys.

51:19.720 --> 51:20.560
Thank you so much.

51:20.560 --> 51:21.400
We appreciate it.

51:21.400 --> 51:22.720
Bye, enjoy your questions.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.680
Clicker, clicker.

51:26.680 --> 51:27.520
Thank you.

51:27.520 --> 51:28.880
Okay.

51:28.880 --> 51:31.640
Next up, we have Hear Me Out.

51:31.640 --> 51:33.440
Please welcome Hear Me Out.

51:33.440 --> 51:42.520
All right, guys.

51:42.520 --> 51:44.640
Hey, hi, my name is Marcus.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.480
I'm from Hear Me Out.

51:45.480 --> 51:47.680
And what we've built is an AI-driven

51:47.680 --> 51:49.160
customer service pipeline,

51:49.160 --> 51:51.560
optimizing call matching and visibility.

51:51.560 --> 51:53.000
So that might leave you scratching your head.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.600
So let's just talk about the problem.

51:55.600 --> 51:57.080
So let me give you a bit of context.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.120
I'm an exchange student

51:58.120 --> 52:00.320
and when I first came here, I had to deal with so many things.

52:00.320 --> 52:01.960
I had to deal with banking.

52:01.960 --> 52:03.160
I had to deal with insurance.

52:03.160 --> 52:04.480
I had to deal with deliveries.

52:04.480 --> 52:06.680
And I even had my car break down on me

52:06.680 --> 52:08.080
and that was a real pain.

52:09.480 --> 52:11.280
In short, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number

52:11.280 --> 52:12.440
of customer service calls

52:12.440 --> 52:13.360
because for each of these things,

52:13.360 --> 52:16.000
I had to make so many calls just to get things done.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.800
And I think a lot of you guys can relate to that.

52:17.800 --> 52:20.160
We've all had our fair share of bad call experiences

52:20.160 --> 52:21.640
where we're upset,

52:21.640 --> 52:23.600
the customer service representative is also upset

52:23.600 --> 52:25.080
and nothing is done.

52:25.080 --> 52:26.920
We've also had good experiences as well.

52:26.920 --> 52:27.760
And I think that's the core

52:27.760 --> 52:29.560
of what we're trying to tackle here.

52:29.560 --> 52:30.840
We want to create a pipeline

52:30.840 --> 52:33.760
that tries to provide optimal matching

52:33.760 --> 52:36.560
and provide visibility on emotional data to businesses.

52:37.920 --> 52:39.240
So we also did the research

52:39.240 --> 52:41.440
and I think the numbers speak for itself.

52:41.440 --> 52:43.360
This is a key problem with a sizable market

52:43.360 --> 52:46.520
and a sheer number of people are affected by this as well.

52:47.720 --> 52:49.480
And this is our problem statement, which is,

52:49.480 --> 52:52.040
how might businesses which offer customer service calls

52:52.040 --> 52:54.440
provide a better experience for their customers?

52:55.600 --> 52:58.040
So we think we can tackle this in four key components.

52:58.040 --> 52:59.880
First of all, an improved call bot.

52:59.880 --> 53:02.000
We all are common with that initial robo call

53:02.000 --> 53:02.840
that we have to deal with

53:02.840 --> 53:04.920
and sometimes it's really, really frustrating.

53:04.920 --> 53:07.080
How many times have the call bot talk to you

53:07.080 --> 53:09.000
and it just doesn't direct you to the right person?

53:09.000 --> 53:11.200
I think we've all experienced that before.

53:11.200 --> 53:13.080
Second and third, and I think this comes hand in hand,

53:13.080 --> 53:14.840
it's just business visibility.

53:14.840 --> 53:16.920
We want to provide businesses with better visibility

53:16.920 --> 53:20.320
of both call experiences data

53:20.320 --> 53:23.360
as well as customer representatives bandwidths over the day

53:23.360 --> 53:25.480
as they continue to take calls.

53:25.480 --> 53:28.160
And finally, this is where we put those two together.

53:28.160 --> 53:30.960
We want to take that data and optimize a customer's journey

53:30.960 --> 53:35.280
through a better customer to service representative matching.

53:35.280 --> 53:38.120
So I won't bore you with this data,

53:38.120 --> 53:40.040
but with that in mind,

53:40.040 --> 53:42.880
we developed a set of decoupled microservices

53:42.880 --> 53:45.920
and I just want to point three key parts out to you.

53:45.920 --> 53:49.080
So first of all, we want to assess customer agreeability

53:49.080 --> 53:50.880
with an initial robo call,

53:50.880 --> 53:52.840
but this won't just be your normal robo call.

53:52.840 --> 53:55.360
We want to use Hume's EVI to manage the robo call

53:55.360 --> 53:56.600
in an empathetic manner

53:56.600 --> 53:59.200
such that it measures the customer's emotions

53:59.200 --> 54:00.520
as they go through the call

54:00.520 --> 54:03.360
and eventually outputs an agreeability score

54:03.360 --> 54:04.200
for the customer.

54:05.160 --> 54:07.680
Second of all, we have a call analysis feedback loop

54:07.680 --> 54:08.920
and that's that whole thing on the right

54:08.920 --> 54:09.960
that goes down below.

54:09.960 --> 54:12.120
And what this does is once you have a call connected

54:12.120 --> 54:14.040
between a customer and a representative,

54:14.040 --> 54:15.520
it takes in multiple factors of data

54:15.520 --> 54:17.160
such as the call duration,

54:17.160 --> 54:18.760
the emotional change over the call

54:18.760 --> 54:20.680
and the overall call outcome.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.400
Using Hume's emotional measurement API,

54:22.400 --> 54:25.040
we can then also generate a call score.

54:25.040 --> 54:27.280
Finally, and this is the third and key part to this,

54:27.280 --> 54:28.440
it's the matching API.

54:28.440 --> 54:30.240
Using the two things that I just mentioned,

54:30.240 --> 54:31.760
we can best match a customer

54:31.760 --> 54:33.400
to a customer service representative

54:33.400 --> 54:35.400
which matches their vibe, their energy

54:35.400 --> 54:38.560
and their emotions based on how our custom model is developed.

54:38.560 --> 54:40.480
So what's the outcome of all of this?

54:40.480 --> 54:42.760
As a representative goes through their day,

54:42.760 --> 54:44.960
their state changes depending on how their calls go

54:44.960 --> 54:47.080
and they're bandwidth adjusts accordingly.

54:47.080 --> 54:48.560
This affects the subsequent customers

54:48.560 --> 54:51.320
which they are matched to in a positive manner

54:51.320 --> 54:53.980
and creates a better experience for both parties.

54:55.280 --> 54:57.040
So there's a lot more which we can build

54:57.040 --> 54:59.320
with what we have, but with this foundational pipeline,

54:59.320 --> 55:00.880
we believe we effectively tackle the problem

55:00.880 --> 55:02.000
that needs to be solved.

55:02.000 --> 55:02.840
That's all I have for today.

55:02.840 --> 55:03.680
Thank you.

55:03.680 --> 55:04.520
Thank you.

55:12.200 --> 55:13.200
Nice.

55:13.200 --> 55:14.040
Thank you.

55:17.400 --> 55:19.080
Yeah, I mean a little bit of feedback

55:19.080 --> 55:20.560
similar to the last company as well.

55:20.560 --> 55:23.000
Just there's a lot of companies working in this space too.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.560
So I would just continue to think through

55:25.560 --> 55:27.680
how to find that core differentiation

55:28.880 --> 55:31.800
if you continue to work on this after the hackathon.

55:31.800 --> 55:32.920
Yeah, I completely agree.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.960
I think a key part that we thought was really exciting

55:35.960 --> 55:38.760
was just what you can achieve with custom models.

55:38.760 --> 55:40.680
What we're doing by developing a feedback loop

55:40.680 --> 55:42.680
is we're creating something where we can create,

55:42.680 --> 55:44.680
in a sense, a model which trains itself.

55:44.680 --> 55:47.120
We can assess how calls might improve

55:47.120 --> 55:49.400
or get worse after the matching

55:49.400 --> 55:51.560
and that feedback gets fed straight to the matching API

55:51.560 --> 55:53.600
so that it knows whether or not it's done a good job or not.

55:53.600 --> 55:54.760
And we find that really interesting

55:54.760 --> 55:56.760
and we think that that's a key differentiating factor

55:56.760 --> 55:57.760
which we can achieve.

55:58.760 --> 56:03.160
There might be some opportunities for building

56:03.160 --> 56:06.080
some sort of synthetic data pipeline here

56:06.080 --> 56:08.120
where you could just sort of simulate calls

56:08.120 --> 56:12.720
with an AI bot of some sort and use that as feedback.

56:12.720 --> 56:14.360
I don't know how good that data will be or not

56:14.360 --> 56:16.240
but it could be interesting.

56:16.240 --> 56:17.440
Yeah, I know that's a really interesting thought.

56:17.440 --> 56:18.280
Thank you.

56:19.400 --> 56:21.000
I know right now you guys are targeting

56:21.000 --> 56:24.280
customer service agents as well as call centers.

56:24.280 --> 56:25.880
Something that could be interesting to think about

56:26.160 --> 56:28.040
as you think about the different stages

56:28.040 --> 56:29.840
of the software adoption lifecycle

56:29.840 --> 56:33.320
as you go from your early adopters to your early majority

56:33.320 --> 56:34.360
and then your late majority

56:34.360 --> 56:37.000
who's eventually gonna justify your evaluation

56:37.000 --> 56:39.560
in terms of what those ideal customer profiles

56:39.560 --> 56:41.840
are going to look like down the line.

56:41.840 --> 56:43.400
Yeah, thank you for that.

56:43.400 --> 56:47.000
I think one key thing was we actually had a judge come to us

56:47.000 --> 56:48.760
and talk to us about how they were doing something similar

56:48.760 --> 56:50.520
for sales representatives as well

56:50.520 --> 56:51.560
and we found that really interesting.

56:51.560 --> 56:53.600
So happy to figure out how we can pivot

56:53.600 --> 56:54.960
if that need arises.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.200
Thank you so much.

56:59.200 --> 57:00.520
Thank you.

57:00.520 --> 57:01.720
Thank you, hear me out.

57:02.840 --> 57:06.040
All right, next up we have Dispatch AI.

57:06.040 --> 57:07.400
Please welcome Dispatch.

57:15.280 --> 57:18.640
Hi everyone, my name is Spike and I'm with Dispatch AI.

57:20.400 --> 57:24.200
In the United States, over 80% of 911 call centers

57:24.280 --> 57:26.160
are critically understaffed.

57:26.160 --> 57:27.800
This means that in a crisis,

57:27.800 --> 57:30.520
people with real emergencies aren't able

57:30.520 --> 57:32.160
to get the support they need

57:32.160 --> 57:34.560
because all the human agents are busy

57:35.440 --> 57:37.600
and they're often put on hold.

57:37.600 --> 57:40.320
This is particularly an issue in our neighboring city

57:40.320 --> 57:44.160
of Oakland where last year the average wait time

57:44.160 --> 57:47.840
was over 60 seconds to pick up a 911 call.

57:47.840 --> 57:50.880
Now in an emergency, every second counts

57:50.880 --> 57:52.720
and this could be literally the difference

57:52.720 --> 57:54.600
between life and death.

57:54.600 --> 57:58.840
This is unacceptable and that's why we built Dispatch AI.

57:58.840 --> 58:02.600
The world's first AI 911 call operator

58:02.600 --> 58:05.480
designed to eliminate these wait times.

58:06.480 --> 58:09.720
Our system is powered by two key components.

58:09.720 --> 58:11.880
First is the voice AI.

58:11.880 --> 58:14.520
The voice AI will step into calls

58:14.520 --> 58:16.720
when all human agents are busy

58:16.720 --> 58:18.840
and it will work with the caller

58:18.880 --> 58:23.280
to evaluate their situation, extract the location

58:23.280 --> 58:26.040
and optionally dispatch first responders

58:26.040 --> 58:27.280
directly to the scene.

58:28.880 --> 58:32.360
And the second part is our powerful dashboard

58:32.360 --> 58:34.080
for the operator themselves.

58:34.080 --> 58:37.240
So the operator will have access to a bird's eye view

58:37.240 --> 58:39.400
of all of the ongoing calls

58:39.400 --> 58:42.520
which will be automatically triaged by the AI

58:42.520 --> 58:45.680
into different forms of severity or priority.

58:45.720 --> 58:48.480
Further, they'll see that the AI

58:48.480 --> 58:51.160
will automatically extract the location

58:51.160 --> 58:54.480
and will provide a live transcript of the call

58:54.480 --> 58:56.560
so that they can quickly see what's going on

58:56.560 --> 59:00.080
and even step into the call once they're available.

59:00.080 --> 59:02.680
Further, they have buttons that allow them

59:02.680 --> 59:04.440
to directly, with just one click

59:04.440 --> 59:06.200
because the location's already fetched,

59:06.200 --> 59:09.920
dispatch police, firefighters or paramedics.

59:09.920 --> 59:13.440
All of this is done from a human centric angle

59:13.440 --> 59:15.040
and the way how we achieve this

59:15.040 --> 59:18.400
is by taking into account the caller's emotions.

59:18.400 --> 59:22.180
So for instance, when a caller shows signs of anxiety

59:22.180 --> 59:25.520
or fear, the system could work more to calm them down

59:25.520 --> 59:26.640
and make them feel at ease

59:26.640 --> 59:29.720
before taking the next safe step.

59:29.720 --> 59:31.880
This system is fully designed

59:31.880 --> 59:34.720
with ethical safe guides in mind

59:34.720 --> 59:38.000
and part of that was fine tuning a model

59:38.000 --> 59:41.400
on over 50911 calls

59:41.400 --> 59:43.800
so that it could understand the proper protocols

59:43.840 --> 59:48.840
and be knowledgeable on a wide variety of possible scenarios

59:51.280 --> 59:53.560
in which a 911 operator could assist in,

59:53.560 --> 59:56.440
including fake calls or instances

59:56.440 --> 59:58.240
where it may not need assistance.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.080
This is all powered by our innovative tech stack

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.400
that utilizes a variety of AI components,

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.760
including the voice AI, the emotional analysis

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.860
and of course a key component of this,

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.680
the fine tuning itself.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.280
Our mission is to make requesting emergency services

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.660
more effective and efficient.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.000
Thank you.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:30.700
I'll go first.

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.880
I thought you did a great job.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.120
I thought you presented the problem set,

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.880
the opportunity and the product very clearly.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.960
It only had three minutes,

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.040
but you hit all the relevant points.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:42.880
Thank you.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.040
The one thing I would encourage you

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.760
to think about a little bit is

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.640
sort of like the optimization function

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.440
for these municipalities, right?

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.480
Cause if people in Oakland are waiting 60 seconds

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.520
to get their 911 call answered,

01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.960
like there's a reason for that.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.800
I don't know what that is,

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.480
but somehow these municipalities have decided

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.160
that that's how they want it to be.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.920
And so I would just think about like,

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.280
you know, as you bring in AI to this problem,

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.760
doing the like potentially difficult AB tests

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.160
of making sure that whatever it is

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.880
that these municipalities are actually optimizing for

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.440
is actually improved by this.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.600
Cause it seems like a no-brainer when you first say it,

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.760
but like clearly it's this way for some reason

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.200
that it's probably nuanced and tricky.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.800
So just something to think about.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.240
Any other feedback?

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.240
Just following up on that,

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.040
I think the key is ease of adoption.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.040
I mean, I think you,

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.640
it's easy going to be easy to make a productivity argument

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.320
to the city of Oakland,

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.200
but then you got to think about who's actually installing,

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.440
who's paying for this and who's installing it.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.160
Okay, that's good.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.360
Thank you so much.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.200
Thank you.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.560
He just batch.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.760
All right.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.880
And next up, we have ASL Brigify.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.480
Please welcome ASL Brigify.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.280
Hello, my name is Isha

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.080
and today I'll be presenting ASL Brigify,

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:21.040
the next generation of sign language and interactive learning.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.440
Oh.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.560
Oh, this?

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.640
Okay.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.520
Sorry.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.680
So what was the inspiration behind this?

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.480
Well, ASL is the third most studied language

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.000
after Spanish and English

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.040
and over a billion people are projected

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.680
to have some sort of hearing loss deficiency,

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.680
which is why it's even more important

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.480
to have a seamless way of for people

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.880
with hearing loss deficiencies

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.160
to communicate with people without them and vice versa.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.720
And next, there's over a 15,000% return on investment

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.360
over a 10 year period,

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.480
demonstrating the value proposition

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.280
and existing platforms like Duolingo surprisingly

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.840
do not take into account ASL learning,

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.800
which is why it's important to build

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.760
an interactive platform where individuals

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.080
can retrieve the accuracy of their signed texts

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.320
as well as characters.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.600
Now, our solution includes three proprietary AI models.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.560
First, we use random forest,

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:30.440
the random forest algorithm in order to,

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.960
in order to map input pose estimation frames,

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:38.000
a frame length of 200 to the predicted,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.760
to the predicted alphabet from A to Z.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.640
Next, we also use an LSTM model,

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.760
which captures sequential dependencies

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.560
to map from hand pose coordinates

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.640
to the actual word.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.120
And then we also have our individualized RAG

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:01.120
calling in Lang chain as well as PDFs

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:05.000
PDFs that are specific to ASL learning

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.160
that get chunked and transformed

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.760
in a vector dimension space.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.440
Now, as you can see here,

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.440
this is a hand pose estimation extraction

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.400
using the media pipe library.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.440
So you can see A, B and C.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.720
And here's our platform where you can,

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.480
there are different modules to learn

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.920
alphabets, signs, as well as sentences.

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.040
And we even have, we even have a real-time ASL practice.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.680
So in real-time to capture the sign that you are actually,

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.260
the letter that you're actually signing

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.320
and give you the accuracy for that.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.640
So here's an example of us using the media pipe library

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:47.560
to actually extract all of the hand key points.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.400
And here are some videos where they're over hundreds

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.040
of words that you can actually view

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.000
to learn each of the hand signing frames.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.720
Now, this is our proprietary RAG.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:04.320
And the way we've trained this is we've collected,

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.200
we've collected a variety of PDFs

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.840
that are essentially manuals for ASL learning.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.560
And potentially in the future,

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.760
we would want to incorporate things like YouTube transcriptions

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:21.200
that can actually be transformed and embedded

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.280
within our vector dimension model.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.480
Now, in the future, this doesn't,

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.600
ASL doesn't just, hand pose estimation doesn't just have

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:36.520
to be localized to ASL.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.400
There are plenty of other opportunities

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.320
for human pose estimation, including fields

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.040
like dance, martial arts,

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.520
where you can not only identify certain techniques,

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:50.720
but you can also get feedback generations

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.400
from certain input frames.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.920
And in the future, this could also be integrated

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:59.640
into existing solutions, such as Zoom, Loom,

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.120
and FaceTime videos.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:06.200
So if there's, so given the signing

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.360
of a certain sentence transcript,

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:13.320
you can get in real time the actual predicted sentences

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.160
and words.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.080
Okay.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.680
Thank you.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.520
Thank you.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.360
Thank you.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.160
That's nice work for 36 hours.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:38.920
I would be, I spent some time creating assistive

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.960
technologies for the blind,

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.720
and I would be just very aware of the market

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.400
and how you'll approach it and who will be paying.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.400
I think that will be a good thing to pay attention to.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.240
Thank you.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.360
Yeah, as you think about the market,

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.240
I feel like these language learning apps

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:06.080
are tricky to kind of scale to meaningful businesses.

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.840
There was sort of like Rosetta Stone,

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:08.840
whatever, 20 years ago,

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.080
and then there's been like Duolingo

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.080
on this most recent gen,

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.600
but there aren't like that many

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.000
that get to meaningful scale.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.920
So might be worth just thinking about that market

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.960
and what are the kind of success drivers?

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.160
I think even as I mentioned previously,

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.640
apart from just hand pose estimation,

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.120
I think that there's a big market

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.920
for body pose estimation.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.720
I think especially in things like combat training,

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.800
especially like if you look at the military,

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.680
even dance performance companies

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.000
where they have to train dancers

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.600
and they're actually specific techniques

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.400
in which they'd want ground truth feedbacks for,

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.920
I think those are also potential markets

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.320
that could be ready to penetrate into.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.280
You chose more traditional machine learning algorithms

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.800
in early neural nets like LSTM,

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.160
and that may be the right answer.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.080
That's not obvious to me,

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.880
but I think for today's audience,

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.680
we need to explain why you're not using

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:07.680
more contemporary GNAI algorithms.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.800
Yeah, so initially we were actually thinking about

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.440
using more encoder-based transformer models,

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.480
but we ran into some struggles,

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.480
so we just ended up settling on the LSTMs,

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.040
but in the future, we would obviously adapt

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.000
more of the state of the art transformers,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.800
and even in the case for feedback generation

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.480
for given hand poses,

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.800
that could be an easy encoder-to-decoder

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.280
multi-self-attention model that you could train.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.720
Okay, thank you so much.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.560
Thank you.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.400
Thank you.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.920
All right, our last contestant for the grand prize

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:56.800
is Greenwise.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.400
Please welcome Greenwise.

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.240
Thank you.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:10.480
When I was 14, I stopped eating all meat.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.760
I lasted about two months.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.680
Now, even though I still eat meat,

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.080
there are a lot of small changes you can make

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.440
that have a huge impact on your carbon footprint.

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:28.160
For example, by switching from beef to chicken,

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.520
you cut the carbon footprint of your meals by six times.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.080
What we do is we help you make that switch

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.120
from beef to chicken for everything,

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.800
for your shoes, your shirt, household supplies, food.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.960
Everything has a carbon cost

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.240
and a carbon footprint that we can mitigate.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.600
So how does a consumer analyze all their purchases

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.520
and the carbon footprint of anything

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.280
and try to make all these very difficult decisions

01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.120
and research about how they should change their actions?

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.480
Well, this is where Greenwise comes in.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.120
We seamlessly integrate with existing customer purchase models

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:12.120
to basically input what the consumer is already doing,

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.800
for example, through receipts or through emails,

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.200
and we integrate with Apple Pay, with Amazon,

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.240
and with Square to automatically get their purchases

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.800
into our system.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.800
From there, we vectorize their purchase

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.040
and compare it to our vector database.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.840
This database has all the carbon footprints

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:37.280
of over 10,000 products that we've analyzed

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.760
and made sure that these are accurate carbon estimates.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.320
Additionally, by using the vector embedding,

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.920
we make sure that these similarity scores are very accurate.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.400
It's not an LLM that can hallucinate.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.960
These are real accuracy scores and real carbon predictions.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.720
From there, it directly can tell them

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.600
an alternative product that is very similar

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.520
but has less carbon footprint.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:03.400
Additionally, this provides a lot of room for scaling

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.200
when other businesses want to analyze

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.120
their carbon footprint for their products

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.040
or for events and other bigger venues.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:19.400
So from good intentions to reality, let's make it happen.

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.560
Thank you.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.760
It's a very innovative rag use case.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.360
I never thought of that.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.480
We're not using graph.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.840
Oh, it's not.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.720
It's similar in that it uses a vector embedding

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.360
for finding similarity,

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:45.400
but the similarity is directly the output.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.280
Yes, that's right.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.720
Yeah, yeah, that's all it is.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.960
Is this a subscription product?

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.560
So currently?

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:57.320
Are you would imagine it being a subscription product?

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.760
We would imagine, or maybe you could talk about it.

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:03.200
Probably not.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.560
Ideally, we'd integrate with existing businesses,

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:14.560
like Instacart or Safeway, so that they can show our results

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:19.680
on how the carbon footprint of certain products

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:27.200
is on their app, but it also works for consumers

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.480
to use on their own, as demonstrated here.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.560
People wouldn't pay for a subscription, though.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.280
OK, I think that's all the comments.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.280
Thank you so much.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:49.560
Green wise, thank you.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:52.800
All right, I would now like to invite our esteemed judges

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.920
to convene in this secret room, where judges make their decisions.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.800
And we are going to have the special prizes.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.760
So as I mentioned, a bunch of sponsors

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.800
came to make this all happen.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.320
We're an educational program, and it is entirely

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.040
the support of these sponsors.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.440
And they're not just providing support, they got cool prizes.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.600
So let's bring them on in just a minute.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.040
You're going to hear from each one.

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.400
These are the sponsors for today.

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.920
And I also want to thank our community sponsors.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.200
These are startups, very cool startups

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:28.000
who hung out and helped our young hackers with their needs

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.920
and their cool tools.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.200
All right, so our very first special prize

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.000
is going to be announced by a very special campus partner.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I'd like to welcome the Academic Innovation

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:42.720
Catalyst.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.840
I'd like to welcome out here Matt Sincini and Paul

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:49.720
Warp to tell you about AIC, one of our newest campus partners

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.040
doing very cool stuff.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.320
Please give them a welcome.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.520
Thank you.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.920
Thank you so much, Caroline.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.280
It's just a thrill to be here.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:02.080
So my partner and I, Paul and I created Academic Innovation

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.240
Catalyst, or AIC, to release more innovation

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.240
from academic research for positive social impact.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.720
And we're focused initially on the areas of climate tech

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.960
and AI for good, which is why we're here today.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.880
How do we do this?

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.600
Well, we make proof of concept grants,

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:24.120
so no strings attached, non-dilutive grants

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.440
to academics with an idea.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.760
Then we help them take that idea, carry it

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:33.880
through commercialization to scale and sustainability.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.520
So that's what we do.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.680
We're thrilled to be here today, and we'll

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.200
be making two awards to the most compelling business

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.800
plans or innovations involving the use of AI

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.680
to make the world a better place.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.440
And we couldn't be more excited to announce them

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.480
in five seconds here.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.680
I'll just say that we met with many amazing teams.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.480
It's been an extraordinary weekend.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.680
Thank you so much for including us.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.360
We had to narrow it down to two.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.080
It was tough, but I think you'll see

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.280
that they're well deserving.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.440
So with that, let me hand it to my partner, Paul Warp,

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:12.800
to announce the winners of the AIC AI for Good Awards in 19,

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.200
I'm sorry, 2024.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.240
This is what happens when you get old people up here on stage.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.600
So anyway, we are really thrilled to be here, as Matt said,

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.800
and we're especially thrilled with the fact

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.440
that so many of you are putting your talents

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:33.040
to work for such great causes and for the betterment

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.320
of humanity.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.280
And AI has so much potential in so many realms,

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.240
but among the most important is to make the world a better

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.880
place and to make a social impact.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.080
And so with that, we're thrilled to announce

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:50.280
the first two winners, Dispatch AI and ASL Brigify.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:58.120
So these are tremendous companies.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:01.320
Again, the competition was so strong.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.040
May I ask actually both sets of winners

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.640
to stand in the audience here?

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.760
And thank you again so much for the terrific work.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:14.640
I think as you heard, ASL Brigify

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:21.040
is doing for sign language what Duolingo has done for learning

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:21.920
other languages.

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.000
And it is so important.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.280
It's incredible and shocking that it's an underserved

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.920
and currently not served market.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.680
And their technologies are going to change that.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.440
And Dispatch AI, what can you say?

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:36.000
I mean, it's such an important issue

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.320
to be able to get emergency response,

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.520
to be able to get a response when you need it.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.680
And of course, the reality is when we have, unfortunately,

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.200
too many mass catastrophes, the time

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.240
when you need the response strapped

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.120
is that you're often most short staffed.

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:56.840
And so Dispatch AI is using artificial intelligence

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:01.080
and a variety of technologies to speed that process up

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:04.880
and to help both the dispatchers and the people

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.240
that the dispatchers are helping.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.960
And so can I ask the Dispatch AI team to stand up as well

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:09.920
and be recognized?

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.840
It's a great job.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.520
Congratulations to all of you and to everyone

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.400
who is here today.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.040
Thank you so much.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.200
Thank you, Madam Paul.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.440
Thank you, Academic Innovation Catalyst.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.800
Our next special prize is going to be

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.960
introduced by our very own General Manager at Skydeck,

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.080
Sybil Chen.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:30.880
Give her a welcome.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.380
Woo!

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.080
Hello, everyone.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.000
Hope everyone has had a great weekend.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.520
At Skydeck, we have about a year and a half ago,

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.680
we launched the Skydeck Climate Tech track.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:51.080
In part, thanks to a nice grant from the university,

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.400
we had $150,000 to build out the track.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.480
And right away, we started putting that to work.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:02.240
We grew our advisor network from maybe like five advisors

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:05.720
in the climate tech to now over 30 advisors that

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.520
are in the climate tech space.

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.240
And beyond that, prior to the grant,

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.840
we had maybe three or five startups, every batch that

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.200
were in climate tech.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:18.560
And now we average 15 startups per batch

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.320
in the climate tech space.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.800
And we really hope to see that grow.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:26.800
So I'm very pleased to announce that the winner of the Skydeck

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.080
Climate Tech track is Team Greenwise.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.120
I think they're still in the green room

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.240
because they just pitched.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.240
They were the last ones to go on stage.

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:40.640
But they really kind of represent the team members

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.680
that we'd like to see at early stage startups.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.480
It's three team members that are best friends

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.840
from middle school.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:48.520
Yeah, they are.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.000
Oh, they're out here on stage.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.160
Come on out.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.160
I wasn't expecting that.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.960
But Anthony, Ben, and Ethan, three best friends

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:00.920
from middle school representing UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz,

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:04.200
and UC Santa Barbara.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.600
And they've built a platform for carbon footprint tracking

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.520
with actionable recommendations for vendors

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:17.200
so that people and companies can reduce their overall carbon

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.040
footprint.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.840
So please help me in congratulating this team.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.880
Winners of $25,000.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.880
All right.

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.200
Yes?

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:47.880
Awesome.

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.320
Well, hey, thank you so much, Skydeck Team,

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.000
for having us and Calhacks.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.480
This has been an extremely impressively run operation.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.320
And we're really excited to be partners and sponsors

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.920
of this hackathon.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.840
Today, we have three different prizes.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.800
Actually, let me introduce myself first.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.240
We have Brandon, Kevin, and Rohit.

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:09.680
We are members of the Generative AI Organization at AWS.

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:12.120
We work with top Generative AI startups

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.720
like Anthropics, Stability, Perplexity, and others

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.080
in the development of their large language models,

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:23.240
as well as our overall kind of inorganic and organic growth

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.880
strategy, including investments as well.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.040
Today, we have three different prizes.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:31.280
We have four of the teams that we have chosen

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.000
to give the prizes out to.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.360
Our first place prize is for $10,000 in AWS credits.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:40.120
And we have two other prizes, one for climate tech

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.840
and then one for responsible AI, which are $5,000.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:47.760
I did want to say that we talked to so many impressive startups

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.000
and founding teams today and hackathon teams today.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.280
I wish we could give prizes to all of them.

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:57.880
We did want to recommend that those who we spoke with,

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.400
and I think we have these conversations with you already,

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.040
to go ahead and apply for the AWS Generative AI

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.080
accelerator, as well as our AWS Activate

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.440
program to receive additional credits.

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.200
I'll go first.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:12.120
I'm going to be announcing the climate tech.

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:15.360
We're going to give the prize out to disaster aid,

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.600
is disaster aid in the room today.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.680
Yes, good job, guys.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.960
And then for responsible AI, we have a two-way tie,

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:29.080
so we're splitting that prize into 2.5K for each team

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:32.560
in credits, and that's GPT ethics and DP ancestry.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.240
They're in the hall.

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.080
All right.

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.840
And I'll round us out.

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.960
Our grand prize, kind of the most impressive thing

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.080
that we heard and saw today, is going to go to Safeguard.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:48.880
So Safeguard team, if you're in the building,

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:49.800
stand up real fast.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:53.120
Let's give you a round of applause.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.440
I don't see them, but God bless you

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.080
and keep doing what you're doing.

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:57.920
Thanks so much, guys.

Please come out, Tony Wahn.

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.200
Out of order.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.440
Let me see if I can find you.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.720
There you are.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.440

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.640
And thank you to everyone for being here,

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:26.120
from across the country, from across the world.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.120
My name is Tony, and I'm from Reach Capital.

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.800
And let's just cut to the chase, because there's

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.640
no drama here.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:34.720
We want to congratulate Frodo for winning our AI and Education

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.680
Please stand up.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.160
All right, you are right up front.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.320
You are in the right place.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.080
Thank you so much.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.000
You've won the one ring, as they say,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.280
or at least our $1,000 cash prize.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.400
So please, let's meet up afterwards.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.320
Reach Capital, we're an early stage edtech VC firm

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.360
investing in edtech.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:59.880
We invest in education across K12, higher ed, and workforce,

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:03.640
in tools that expand access to education and accountability.

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.840
And many of the companies that are portfolio

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.720
were founded by students themselves,

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:11.440
because what better place to find great ideas and great

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:14.520
talent than to go to places like this, where students are

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.600
living that experience?

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.920
So if you're building an edtech, please reach out.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.280
Thank you so much.

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:22.920
Thank you, Tony.

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:26.440
Next up, we have you.com.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.320
We have Rex.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.480
Come on out, Rex, and tell us about the prize.

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.600
Applauds, please, for our sponsors.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:35.100
Hi, buddy.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.080
Yeah, thank you so much.

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.560
Yeah, so we wanted to announce, I'm Rex.

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:40.480
We're from you.com.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.600
This is Oliver.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:47.320
As you know, you.com brings transparency and web access

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.960
to our LLMs to make sure that they are as accurate as possible.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.280
So we wanted to give an award for the best use of you.com's

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.080
APIs to transferify.

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.160
So congratulations.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:00.200
If you guys want to stand up, if you're here, there you guys are.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.960
Yeah, thank you so much.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.480
Transferified did an incredible job.

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:07.040
They were live streaming videos, fact checking them

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.200
as they went, using sources from the web,

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.160
and you.com search APIs.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.040
It was really incredible and powerful.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.040
And Oliver will talk about our custom assistant.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.120
Yeah, so for our best custom assistant,

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:23.400
we'd like to give that to events-.ai with Oliver and Devesh.

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.000
So Oliver and Devesh, can you please stand up

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:28.080
if you're in the room?

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:28.580
Congrats.

01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:29.080
Over there.

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:29.580
Thank you.

01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:30.080
Yeah.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:37.360
So we were particularly impressed by what they've built.

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.680
Essentially, they handled booking, searching,

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:43.160
and even talking with customer agents on the phone.

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:47.720
And they used you.com in a way to actually find these events.

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.440
So we were incredibly impressed by them

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:52.440
and can't wait to see what they'll do in the future.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.080
Yeah, come find us after.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.840
And we will give you your awards.

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.360
Thank you, Hume.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:58.960
Are you?

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.000
Thank you.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.560
All right, I think we're going back to Hume now

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:05.080
with Zach Greathouse.

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.120

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.240

It's a personalized learning assistant.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.280
Are you in the room?

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:06.840
Where are you?

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:07.480

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.440
Hey, everyone.

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.920
Very nice to be here.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:38.480
For those of you who haven't heard about Grock,

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:43.320
grock.com experienced the fastest inference on Earth

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:43.880
period.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:46.160
All I have to say about Grock right now.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.120
But our special Grock Star Award today

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.640
goes to Scam Scanner.

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:54.800
Where are you guys?

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:59.280
So these guys have a product that I

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:02.600
want my mom to use today, right?

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:06.240
Monitor your call for potential scams.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.560
Who doesn't want that for your mom, your uncles,

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.720
and the whole thing?

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:18.600
Now, they get 1,000 credits on Grock Cloud,

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.680
which is many, many millions of tokens.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.680
There's two special mentions I have to read,

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.480
so I don't screw up.

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.560
Three brown, one blue.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:34.800
Where are you guys?

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.840
Another awesome solution.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:41.400
These guys are generating on the fly

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.960
incredible videos for math.

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:47.640
Something that I would use right now as well.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:51.480
And Transverify, are you guys around here?

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:53.720
You've been mentioned as well.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.440
Transverify, very cool.

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:59.520
Who doesn't want to hear a podcast with instant fact

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.520
checking, right?

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.160
Am I right?

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:06.720
Now, my special surprise for the day,

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.040
I want to make a very special mention of Nathan Bog.

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.240
Are you around?

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.640
Nathan, all right.

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.800
Nathan didn't use Grock.

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:22.320
So I'm going to give a special technical excellence

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:28.880
award to Nathan for a model he trained and ran on his CPU

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:34.680
for doing very interesting DOM operations, corrections

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:36.640
on the fly for front end.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.160
Not only that, Nathan is invited, officially,

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:47.280
to present his work in the Grock HQ as soon as he can.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.520
That's it, guys.

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:52.000
I'm very impressed with all the work we saw.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:52.880
Thank you very much.

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:53.640
Congratulations.

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.080
Thank you, Grock.

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.920
All right.

01:29:56.920 --> 01:30:01.520
Our esteemed judges are back with their determination.

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.720
Please come back, judges.

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:08.840
Come back so we can all enjoy the grand prize.

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:10.240
Are you guys ready?

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.160
Do you have a guess?

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:12.960
Is there a voting?

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.560
Do we have voting tally?

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.080
Taking bets?

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:20.160
Everybody, I want you to guess your top two choices

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.080
for grand prize.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:25.440
And then I'm going to ask, who got it right?

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.520
OK.

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:31.080
So as our wonderful judges, take their seat.

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.800
All right, we got some shout outs going here.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:36.520
Any other shout outs?

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.080
OK.

01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.280
All right, this audience is into it.

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:42.400
So as a reminder, the grand prize

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:47.200
is a $25,000 investment from the Berkeley Skydeck fund.

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:51.560
Also, a golden ticket to our Pad 13 program at Skydeck.

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:55.240
And a special prize, we are happy to announce,

01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:00.720
that OpenAI is providing $2,500 in credits for this winter.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:03.360
So I think we're ready for the drum roll.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.200
Take your guesses.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.760
Only the judges know.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:07.640
I don't know.

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.240
We're all about to find out.

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.960
It's Dispatch AI.

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:12.160
Dispatch, where are you?

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:14.480
Come on up.

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:15.560
There's stairs right there.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:18.760
Come on, come to the front stage.

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:19.600
There you go.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:20.840
Thank you, judges.

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.640
I want to invite, while we invite Dispatch up,

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:25.480
I want to thank all of you for coming.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:31.400
I want to invite Spike from Dispatch.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.680
OK, here's the team.

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:34.600
There we go.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:38.560
Dispatch AI, grand prize winners.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.280
Well done.

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:42.200
Well done.

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:44.640
I'd like to invite the Skydeck staff to come out,

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:47.120
and the Berkeley Hackathon staff to come out.

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.560
Come on out.

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:50.160
They've been working all weekend.

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:53.520
I think some of them did not sleep at all.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:57.320
Please give everyone who joined to make this a huge round

01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.240
of applause.

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.840
Thank you, everybody.

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.800
Thanks for joining us.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.040
We will see you next year.

01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.040
Woo!
