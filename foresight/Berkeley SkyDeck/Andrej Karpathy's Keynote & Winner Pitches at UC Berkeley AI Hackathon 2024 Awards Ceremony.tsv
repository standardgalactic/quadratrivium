0	6880	Welcome to the clothing ceremony of UC Berkeley's AI Hackathon.
6880	9680	I want to call on stage the awesome,
9680	14280	incredible executive director of Skydeck, Caroline Winat.
14280	16400	Thank you, Rene.
16400	20160	Hi, everybody. How are you doing?
20160	24480	Awesome. You ready to hear who won the Hackathon?
24480	26880	Yes, you are. How many hackers here?
26880	28360	How many in the audience?
28360	30880	Oh, nice. Very good.
30880	34440	All right. We're going to get started because I think you want to hear Andre.
34440	36200	Yes, you want to hear Andre.
36200	37520	Yes, you want to hear Andre.
37520	39680	All right. Let's quick run through.
39680	43080	You want to hear some cool facts about what has been happening.
43080	44760	This is what we're going to do today.
44760	47040	We're going to get to our pitches soon.
47040	48920	This is some pictures.
48920	50880	All you hackers, did we have fun?
50880	52480	Did we have a good time?
52480	54800	I had an absolute blast.
54800	57600	Yes, there were llamas for sure.
57720	59160	I was there most of the time.
59160	61120	I was not there at 3 a.m.
61120	63440	But I was so impressed with all of you.
63440	65840	You hacked your hearts out.
65840	68360	And I'm so proud of all of you,
68360	72120	whether on stage or in audience, you're all completely awesome.
72120	75120	All right. How many people they took to make this happen?
75120	78960	This giant number, 371.
78960	81800	UC Berkeley Skydeck, which I represent,
81800	85720	and Calhacks Educational Program and Student Organization.
85760	89360	So I think we did a pretty decent job of getting this all together.
89360	90920	This is how it breaks down.
90920	95520	Hackathon at Berkeley Directors, Skydeck staff, sponsors.
95520	97880	We're going to give some love to sponsors.
97880	100520	As I mentioned, we're an educational program.
100520	102680	Calhacks is a student organization.
102680	106040	This is all because of the sponsors.
106040	107400	So we're going to give them a ton of love
107400	108640	when they come up on stage.
108640	110800	You with me? Awesome.
110840	115320	Okay, 140 judges, 100 plus volunteers,
115320	118760	and 80 mentors hanging out helping everybody.
118760	120680	Let me tell you a bit about Skydeck.
120680	122920	Who hasn't heard of Skydeck?
122920	124200	Anybody?
124200	125320	A couple of you.
125320	129320	Skydeck, UC Berkeley's flagship accelerator.
129320	131880	We host 250 startups a year.
131880	135560	Our accelerator track gets $200,000 in investment
135560	137760	from our dedicated Venture Fund.
137760	139160	Pretty cool.
139160	141600	Let me tell you about Berkeley Skydeck Fund,
141600	143640	our dedicated Venture Fund.
143640	145480	Investing in about 40 startups a year.
145480	148600	That's a lot of startups for an adventure fund, by the way.
148600	150480	The 200K investment.
150480	153000	And who wants to apply to Skydeck?
153000	156080	July 16, I want to see all of your startup applications
156080	157040	coming in.
157040	159400	That's in a month.
159400	163840	And hackathons at Berkeley are an amazing student organization.
163840	168680	Truly extraordinary people who helped put this on this event.
168720	170680	This is, of course, what they do.
170680	171760	They do hackathons.
171760	174000	They've been doing it for 10 years.
174000	177160	They do about 2,500 students a year.
177160	180120	And, of course, they reach a ton of universities.
180120	182760	How many people here not from Cal?
182760	184320	Hacking not from Cal?
184320	185480	Fantastic.
185480	186600	Welcome.
186600	189720	Berkeley is a place where we bring great talent in.
189720	191040	Y'all are great talent.
191040	191880	We brought you here.
191880	193480	That's what we do.
193480	195960	That's what Berkeley Hackathons does.
195960	201840	Come to their 11th big hackathon in San Francisco in October.
201840	203080	Check them out on social media.
203080	205840	Get on that LinkedIn, all of that.
205840	207440	Who's coming to San Francisco?
207440	208440	Y'all coming?
208440	209080	Yes!
209080	211000	OK, fantastic.
211000	211840	All right.
211840	214120	Thank you to our partners, all of you
214120	217080	who brought your hackers here, including our friends
217080	218320	down to the South Bay.
218320	221480	Thank you for joining us and all the other great universities.
221480	222560	Fantastic.
222560	224400	Really happy to have you.
224400	226600	Do you want to hear Andre?
226600	229000	Do you want to hear Andre?
229000	229880	Yes!
229880	234040	Please give a huge round of applause for our keynote speaker,
234040	235360	founding member of OpenAI.
235360	236120	I need the applause.
236120	237080	Come on, keep going.
237080	239560	Andre, come on up.
239560	241120	Carpathian.
241120	244080	Yes, big applause.
244080	245080	Thank you.
247640	250040	Hi, everyone.
250040	251480	Yeah, so thank you for inviting me.
251480	254440	It's really a great pleasure to be here.
254440	257680	I love, love, love hackathons.
257680	259600	I think there's a huge amount of energy,
259600	261560	a huge amount of creativity, young people
261560	265120	trying to do cool things, learning together, creating.
265120	266880	It's just like my favorite place to be,
266880	268480	and I've had my fair share of hackathons.
268480	273080	So really a great pleasure to be here and talk to you today.
273080	276040	So one thing is this is bigger than I expected
276040	277280	when they invited me.
277280	279240	So this is really large here.
279240	282600	I kind of feel like actually the scale of the hackathon
282600	284160	is quite large.
284160	286400	And I guess one thing I wanted to start with
286400	289280	is that just in case you're wondering,
289280	291600	this is not normal for AI.
291600	293720	I've been in AI for about 15 years,
293720	295600	so I can say that with confidence.
295600	298560	And it's kind of just grown a lot.
298560	302560	So for me, AI is a couple of hundred academics
302560	305280	getting together in a workshop of a conference
305280	308800	and talking together about some esoteric details
309240	310400	of some math.
310400	312480	And so this is what I'm used to.
312480	315400	This is when I entered AI about 15 years ago.
315400	318160	You're working with, say when you're training neural networks,
318160	320440	you're working with these tiny digits from MNIST.
320440	322280	You're training a restricted Boltzmann machine.
322280	324720	You're using contrastive divergence to train your network.
324720	328840	And then you're scrutinizing these on your first light
328840	330600	to make sure that the network trained correctly.
330600	332440	And I know none of that makes any sense
332440	334280	because it's been so long ago,
334280	336080	but it was a different vibe back then
336080	337760	and it was not as crazy.
337800	340120	I think things have really gotten out of proportion
340120	342000	to some extent, but it is really beautiful
342000	343280	to see the energy.
343280	347240	And today, 15 years later, it looks a lot more like this.
349920	352120	So this is, I guess, where AI is today.
352120	355000	And that's also why this event is the largest I expect.
355000	357000	So yeah, NVIDIA, the manufacturer of GPUs,
357000	358520	which is used for all the heavy lifting
358520	359600	for our neural networks,
359600	363040	is now the most valuable company in the United States
363040	364440	and has taken over.
364440	366520	And this is the day that we live in today
366520	368800	and why we have so many hackathons like this and so on,
368800	370120	which I think is quite amazing,
370120	371440	but definitely unprecedented.
371440	373320	And this is a very unique point in time
373320	376720	that many of you maybe are entering the AI field right now.
376720	378280	And this is not normal, it's super interesting,
378280	380320	super unique, there's a ton happening.
380320	382320	Now, I think fundamentally the reason behind that
382320	385120	is that I think the nature of computation
385120	386520	basically is changing.
386520	389640	And we're kind of have like a new computing paradigm
389640	390960	that we're entering into.
390960	391920	And this is very rare.
391920	394760	I kind of almost feel like it's the 1980s
394760	396360	of computing all over again.
396360	398560	And instead of having a central processing unit
398560	401480	that works on instructions over bytes,
401480	402800	we have these large language models,
402800	405800	which are kind of like the central processing unit
405800	409320	working on tokens, which are a little string pieces instead.
409320	410680	And then in addition to that,
410680	411960	we have a contact window of tokens
411960	414000	instead of a RAM of bytes.
414000	416400	And we have a coolant of disk and everything else.
416400	418000	So it's a bit like a computer.
418000	419720	And this is the orchestrator.
419720	422120	And that's why I call this like the large language model,
422120	423520	LMOS.
423560	425560	And I've sort of like tweeted about this
425560	427280	in some more detail before.
427280	429520	And so I see this as a new computer
429520	432160	that we're all learning how to program
432160	434600	and what it's good at, what it's not as good at,
434600	436280	how to incorporate into products,
436280	438920	and really how to squeeze the most out of it.
438920	440760	So that I think is quite exciting.
440760	443960	And I think maybe many of you have seen the GPT-40 demo
443960	446680	that came out from OpenAI two, three weeks ago
446680	447720	or something like that.
447720	449720	And you're really starting to get a sense that
449720	453120	this is a thing that you can actually talk to.
453120	457760	And it responds back in your natural interface
457760	460440	of like audio and it sees and hears and can paint
460440	462200	and can do all these things.
462200	464240	I think potentially many of you have seen this movie.
464240	465920	If you haven't, I would definitely watch it.
465920	469120	It's extremely inspirational for us today, movie Her.
469120	472600	And actually kind of presently in this movie,
472600	475360	when this main character here talks to the AI,
475360	477880	that AI is called an OS, an operating system.
477880	480280	So I think that's very present from that movie.
480280	482920	And it's a beautiful movie and I encourage you to watch it.
482920	485200	Now, the thing is that in this movie,
485200	487200	I think the focus is very much on like the emotional
487200	489280	intelligence kind of aspects of these models.
489280	492400	But these models in practice in our society
492400	494440	will probably be doing a ton of problem solving
494440	495800	in the digital space.
495800	497920	And so it's not just gonna be a single digital entity
497920	501000	that kind of in some weird way resembles a human almost
501000	502160	in that you can talk to it.
502160	504200	But it's not quite a human, of course.
504200	506000	But it's not just a single digital entity.
506000	508720	Maybe there's many of these digital entities.
508720	510320	And maybe we can give them tasks
510320	512040	and they can talk to each other and collaborate
512040	513720	and they have fake slack threads.
513720	516680	And they're just doing a ton of work in the digital space.
516680	519640	And they're automating a ton of digital infrastructure.
519640	521640	Not just a digital infrastructure,
521640	523600	but maybe physical infrastructure as well.
523600	526120	And this is kind of an earlier stages, I would say,
526120	528200	and will probably happen slightly lagging
528200	530200	behind a lot of digital innovations
530200	533160	because it's so much easier to work with bits than atoms.
533160	535200	But this is another movie that I would definitely point you to
535200	536400	as one of my favorites.
536400	538400	It is not very well known at all.
538400	540680	It's called iRobot and it's from 2004.
540680	542520	Will Smith, amazing movie.
542520	545040	And it kind of explores this future with human robots
545040	547120	doing a lot of tasks in society.
547120	549880	And kind of spoiler alert, it doesn't go so well
549880	551000	for these people in this movie.
551000	553680	And the robots kind of take over a little bit.
553680	556640	But I think it's kind of interesting to think through.
556640	559120	And I definitely would encourage you to also watch this movie.
559120	562200	And this movie takes place in 2035, allegedly,
562200	563640	which is 10 years away.
563640	565960	And so maybe in 10 years, you can definitely squint
565960	568120	and think about that maybe we are gonna be in a place
568120	570520	where these things are walking around
570520	572360	and talking to us and performing tasks
572360	574080	in physical world and digital world.
574080	574920	And what does that look like?
574920	575760	What does that mean?
575760	576800	And how do we program them?
576800	580600	How do we make sure that they sort of do
580600	582200	what we want them to, et cetera?
583520	585720	So when you put all this together,
585720	588560	I think the feeling that people talk about often
588560	590160	is this feeling of AGI.
590160	592240	Like do you feel the AGI quote unquote?
592240	594280	And what this means is that you've really intuitively
594280	597360	understand the magnitude of what could be coming
597360	600560	around the corner if the stuff actually continues to work.
600560	602520	The amount of automation that we can potentially have
602520	605320	in both the digital space and the physical space.
605320	606280	Now, I don't know about you,
606280	608240	but I actually find this picture kind of bleak.
608240	610480	This is what came out when I put a bunch of the
610480	613680	last few minutes of talk into an image generator.
613680	615840	And I don't actually like this picture.
615840	617160	I think we can do better.
617160	619440	And we have a few thousand people here.
619440	621480	You're about to enter the industry
621480	623200	and you're gonna be working on a lot of this technology
623200	624200	and you're gonna be shaping it
624200	627760	and you'll have some active sort of power over it.
627760	628720	So I don't know, maybe we want this
628720	630080	to look something like this.
630080	632080	I mean, this is what I would like.
632080	634400	So this is humans, animals, and nature,
634400	636320	coexisting in harmony.
636320	639360	But secretly, this is actually a high tech society
639360	640880	and there are robots and quadcopters
640880	642480	and there's a ton of automation,
642480	645920	but it's hidden away and it's not sort of like in your face.
645920	649040	And so maybe this is something that we want instead.
649040	650680	And you should feel a lot of agency
650680	652680	over what you want the future to be like
652680	654200	because you're gonna build it.
654200	655320	So maybe we can agree right now
655320	657200	that this is better than the previous picture.
657200	658960	But I don't know about you, but I would hope so
658960	661480	because I'm gonna be living in that future, I think.
662480	663880	So the question for this hackathon,
663880	666040	I mean, a lot of you have worked on a real,
666040	668800	a bunch of really cool projects over the last day or two.
668800	671160	And the question is how do we go from hacking
671160	675080	to actually changing the world and building this future,
675080	676680	whatever that may be for you?
676680	678280	And so what I thought I would do in this talk
678280	680800	is go over maybe like my last 15 years or so
680800	681960	in the industry.
681960	684160	And I think I had a bit of a window
684160	687280	into how projects become real role change.
687280	688800	And I have some takeaways and things like that
688800	690600	and that I maybe wanted to talk about.
691520	695120	So the first thing that I find really incredible
695120	698280	is how projects that are sometimes very small projects
698280	700560	like little snowballs can actually like snowball
700560	701920	into really big projects.
701920	704000	And just how incredible that is to watch.
704000	706940	So as an example, I have my fair share of hackathons
706940	708620	like I mentioned, these are some projects
708620	710440	from a long time ago that I worked on
710440	712240	over the last 15 years or so.
712240	715480	So I had a little Rubik's Cube color extractor.
715480	717680	I put up some game programming tutorials on YouTube
717680	720200	like 13 years ago and tried to teach people
720200	721680	programming for games.
721680	724120	I had a video games and a lot of them.
724120	727280	I had this like kind of janky neuro evolution simulator
727280	729480	which was kind of interesting.
729480	732200	And unsurprisingly, not all of these projects
732200	733360	actually go on to snowball.
733360	735920	A lot of this is just exploration, you're tinkering.
735920	737200	And so actually these three projects
737200	738720	didn't really go anywhere for me.
738720	740280	I wouldn't say that it was really wasted work.
740280	742640	It was just like it didn't add up to and didn't snowball
742640	744600	but it was still like helping me along the way.
744600	746200	I'll come back to that later.
746200	748040	But the game programming tutorials actually ended up
748040	749840	snowballing for me in a certain way
749840	752440	because that led me from game programming tutorials
752440	754800	to a bunch of Rubik's Cube videos actually
754800	756760	that became kind of popular at the time.
756760	759680	And this kind of sparked an interest in teaching for me.
759680	762000	And then when I was a PhD student at Stanford,
762000	765840	I got to teach this class CS231N
765840	767360	and got to develop it and teach it.
767360	770280	And this was the first big deep learning class at Stanford.
770280	772800	And a lot of people have gone on to like this.
772800	775880	And then after that, I ended up making another YouTube channel
775880	779640	which is my zero to hero series for deep learning and LLMs.
779640	781440	So a lot of people like that as well.
781440	783200	And then on top of that, continuing to snowball,
783200	785200	the project that I'm currently very interested in
785200	787600	is this next class and what it could look like
787600	788960	and how I can make it better.
788960	791160	And I'm calling that LLM101N.
791160	793080	And it's about building a storyteller,
793080	794600	something like kind of a chat GPT
794600	796680	that you can work with to generate stories.
796680	799520	And the idea is you build everything from scratch
799520	801800	from basic prerequisites all the way to like
801800	804880	kind of a chat GPT clone in the domain of storytelling.
804880	806200	And building that from scratch,
806200	808440	I think will be really instructive, could be really fun.
808440	810880	I only published this on GitHub like two or three days ago.
810880	813560	So it's pretty raw and still very much in the early stages.
813560	814840	But I'm really excited for it.
814840	817320	And this for me is an example of a snowball.
817320	820160	It started with like 13 years ago, a little game programming.
820160	821600	And I'm working on a course
821600	823600	that I think will be really interesting.
825080	825920	Thank you.
825920	831160	Another example from my life, I think,
831160	833360	is the snowball that I've witnessed with OpenAI.
833360	834880	So as was briefly mentioned,
834880	838120	I was a founding member researcher of OpenAI.
838120	839600	And so I was there seven years ago.
839600	841240	These are some images that are public
841240	844960	of what it was like working out of Greg's apartment,
844960	846000	like eight of us.
846000	848200	And OpenAI was founded to be kind of like
848200	850120	a counterbalance to Google.
850120	851600	And Google was like this gorilla,
851600	853680	with 70 billion free cash flow.
853680	855240	And back then, Google employed
855240	858200	like half of the AI research industry almost.
858200	863240	So it was kind of like an interesting setup, I would say.
863240	865080	And we were just like eight people with a laptop.
865080	866600	So that was really interesting.
866600	867840	And very similar to my background,
867840	871280	OpenAI ended up exploring a large number of projects internally.
871280	872840	We hired some really good people.
872840	875120	And many of them didn't go too far,
875120	877360	but some of them really did work.
877360	879320	And so as an example, here's a project
879320	882840	that was in an early stage, a very small snowball
883160	884840	in the early history of OpenAI.
884840	887120	Someone worked on a Reddit chatbot.
887120	889680	And if you come by their desk and you're like,
889680	890960	what does this look like when someone's working
890960	892000	on a Reddit chatbot?
892000	894600	We're trying to compete with Google.
894600	896360	And you're working on a Reddit chatbot.
896360	898440	Like we should be doing something bigger.
898440	901360	And so it's very easy to dismiss these small snowballs,
901360	902440	because they're so fragile.
902440	904720	Right, these projects are so fragile in the beginning.
904720	906000	But actually this Reddit chatbot,
906000	907160	and by the way, don't read too much
907160	908200	into the specific details.
908200	910000	These are kind of like random screenshots,
910000	911440	just for illustration.
911440	912720	But this was a Reddit chatbot.
912760	913760	And it looked naive.
913760	916200	But actually Reddit chatbot, what is that?
916200	917560	It's a language model.
917560	919280	And it happens to be trained on Reddit.
919280	921000	But actually you could train a language model
921000	923120	on any arbitrary data, not just Reddit.
923120	924600	And when the transformer came out,
924600	927600	this was spun into something that worked much better.
927600	929000	And then the domain was expanded
929000	930880	from just Reddit to many other web pages.
930880	933760	And suddenly you get GPT-1, GPT-2, 3, 4,
933760	935400	and then you get GPT-4O.
935400	937080	So actually this Reddit chatbot
937080	939320	that was so easy to dismiss,
939320	941720	actually like ended up leading a snowballing
941720	944240	into GPT-4O, which we currently think of as this like,
944240	945840	change in the computing paradigm.
945840	947680	And you can talk to it, it's amazing.
947680	949200	So it's really incredible for me to have witnessed
949200	952200	some of those, I guess, snowballs.
952200	954360	And today opening out, of course, is worth,
954360	956880	maybe somewhere just below $100 billion or something like that.
956880	958760	So really incredible,
958760	962040	incredible to see some of these snowballs in practice.
962040	964960	So I would say a lot of you over the last two days
964960	967800	have also worked on small projects, small snowballs maybe.
967800	969000	And it's really incredible to me
969000	971240	that some of them probably won't go anywhere,
971240	973200	but probably some of them actually will.
973200	976400	And you should continue the momentum of your projects
976400	978560	and maybe they can add up to a really big snowball
978560	980560	and that's really incredible to watch.
981480	983720	The next thing I wanted to briefly talk about is
983720	985000	this concept of 10,000 hours
985000	987520	that was popularized by Malcolm Gladwell, I think.
987520	989240	I actually am quite a big believer in it.
989240	991200	And I think that to a very large extent,
991200	993560	success comes from just repeated practice
993560	994840	and just a huge amount of it.
994840	997160	And you should be very willing to put in those 10,000 hours
997160	998920	and just literally just count.
998920	1001000	Don't be too nervous about what am I working about?
1001040	1002640	Am I succeeding or failing, et cetera.
1002640	1003920	Just do simple bean counting
1003920	1005640	of how many hours you're gonna, you're doing
1005640	1006960	and everything adds up.
1006960	1008560	Even the projects that I failed at
1008560	1010040	and didn't snowball into anything,
1010040	1013840	those add to my counter of the number of hours I've spent
1013840	1016680	developing my expertise and getting into an empowered state
1016680	1018920	of being able to take on these projects with confidence
1018920	1020240	and getting them to work.
1020240	1021600	So a few examples of that.
1023040	1025640	I made this like really janky website a few weeks ago.
1025640	1026880	This was a weekend project
1026880	1029320	and it's called awesomemovies.life.
1029320	1030520	And you can visit it.
1030520	1032720	I think it still works, I'm not 100% sure.
1032720	1033800	I wouldn't recommend you go there.
1033800	1036320	It's trying to be a movie recommendation engine
1036320	1038200	because I was trying to figure out what to watch
1038200	1040080	on that Saturday and then I was like, okay,
1040080	1042440	I need to build myself a movie recommendation engine.
1042440	1045120	So I put this up and one of the tweets
1045120	1047840	that was replied to mine was, wow, that's so cool
1047840	1049920	that you got this to work in the weekend.
1049920	1053200	And I was kind of reflecting on that at the time
1053200	1056440	because it wasn't as amazing to me.
1056440	1057880	And the reason for that was that
1057880	1059640	what this person is not seeing
1059720	1061560	is that this is my 20th time
1061560	1063760	like making a website like this.
1063760	1065680	So I see all the steps that I was gonna follow.
1065680	1067840	Okay, I need a linode, I need a flask server,
1067840	1070920	I'm gonna write some of this JavaScript style sheets,
1070920	1073080	HTML, I'm gonna spin this up together.
1073080	1075240	I need to scrape all these web pages,
1075240	1078880	I need to extract TFIDF vectors, I need to train SVM.
1078880	1080160	And all of these things are things
1080160	1082000	I've already done before 20 times.
1082000	1083680	I already have code snippets lying around
1083680	1086520	from previous projects and I'm just remixing what I have
1086520	1088000	and I've already done all of this.
1088000	1090120	And so remixing everything into a new form
1090120	1091400	isn't actually that much work
1091400	1093000	and allowed me to put this up over the weekend
1093000	1094520	and it's not that crazy.
1094520	1096160	And this only comes from expertise,
1096160	1098680	this only comes from having done it 20 times
1098680	1101080	and you can do this so confidently.
1101080	1102600	The next example I would say in my life
1102600	1104160	was a Tesla autopilot.
1104160	1107780	So I was hired to lead the computer vision team
1107780	1110840	at Tesla autopilot about seven or eight years ago.
1110840	1113040	And one of the first things I did actually
1113040	1116160	when I joined the team was I basically ended up rewriting
1116160	1119080	the computer vision deep learning network,
1119080	1122200	training code base from scratch in PyTorch
1122200	1124840	in some of the first few months that I entered the team.
1124840	1127140	And I sort of rewrote the whole thing from scratch
1127140	1130000	and that ended up being a kernel of what it is now.
1130000	1132040	And I think to some extent,
1132040	1134240	to some people that looked impressive at the time,
1134240	1137080	but for me it wasn't because I was coming from my PhD
1137080	1139920	and I spent five years doing stuff like that
1139920	1141880	and I knew exactly what needs to go into there.
1141880	1144120	I need my training set, my evaluation sets,
1144120	1146040	I need my training loop in PyTorch,
1146080	1150920	I need my sort of configs, I need my log directories,
1150920	1153400	I need to bring in a ResNet, I need to put in detection,
1153400	1155600	we're doing a regression classification.
1155600	1156520	And so the whole thing,
1156520	1158080	like I'm anticipating all the steps
1158080	1159720	and that only comes from experience,
1159720	1161960	that only comes from having done it 20 times before.
1161960	1163760	And so I think this makes a huge difference
1163760	1165480	and things that look impressive
1165480	1167120	are maybe much less impressive to you
1167120	1168680	if you've done it 20 times before.
1168680	1170440	So really try to get to this point
1170440	1172080	where you have your 10,000 hours,
1172080	1176000	it makes a huge difference and just, yeah, that's it.
1177040	1178640	By the way, 10,000 hours,
1178640	1180640	if you're doing six hours per day,
1180640	1183120	I think this works out to about five years.
1183120	1184920	So it's about a length of a PhD
1184920	1187720	that you need to develop expertise in an area.
1187720	1189360	So I think it's roughly correct
1189360	1191520	that that works out to about a PhD length.
1192680	1195160	The other thing that I found is actually quite useful
1195160	1197520	is to keep the dopamine flowing,
1197520	1200880	be aware of your psychology, your brain, how it works,
1200880	1204280	and what it needs to keep going and how to keep inspired.
1204480	1206640	And so in particular, your brain is a reward machine
1206640	1209200	and it wants rewards and you need to give it rewards.
1209200	1211040	So what is a good way to give it rewards?
1211040	1213960	And in my practice, it is by doing projects
1213960	1216840	and work on projects and continue publishing them.
1216840	1218680	And so here I have a webpage snippet
1218680	1221120	of some of the projects I have worked on in the past
1221120	1223320	and these are hackathon projects and random projects
1223320	1224160	and not all of them are good,
1224160	1226240	some of them are not quite good, et cetera.
1226240	1228560	But what I love about project is a number of things.
1228560	1231920	Number one, I love that projects get you to work
1231920	1234480	on something end-to-end and depth-wise.
1234480	1236080	Like normally when you go to classes,
1236080	1238000	you're learning in a breath-wise fashion.
1238000	1239000	You're learning a lot of stuff
1239000	1241200	just in case you might need it in the future.
1241200	1242480	Well, when you're working on a project,
1242480	1244560	you know what you need and you're learning it on demand
1244560	1246080	and you're just trying to get it to work.
1246080	1249080	So I think it's a very different mode of learning
1249080	1251320	that really complements the breath-wise learning
1251320	1252320	and it's very important.
1252320	1254920	So I 100% encourage people to work on projects.
1254920	1256620	The other thing is putting them up
1256620	1259820	is actually also like a really good Jedi mind trick
1259820	1261160	in my experience.
1261160	1263720	The reason for that is that if you're gonna put something up,
1263720	1264880	you're thinking about all the people
1264880	1266040	who are gonna be looking at it,
1266040	1268000	your friends and teammates and family
1268000	1270280	and future employers, et cetera.
1270280	1273840	And so that really increases the bar for your own work
1273840	1275560	and it makes you work harder
1275560	1276680	because they're gonna be looking at it
1276680	1278720	and you feel shame if it was crappy.
1278720	1279840	And so you work much harder
1279840	1282040	and you're gonna go that extra mile to make it really good
1282040	1284800	and that really, really helps.
1284800	1287360	And lastly, when other people are looking at your projects,
1287360	1288400	you're gonna get that reward
1288400	1290960	because they like it, they appreciate it, they fork it,
1290960	1292040	they work on top of it.
1292040	1294280	And so that feels good to your brain.
1294280	1296760	And so the way that this comes together is
1296760	1299120	you are getting your dopamine, you feel good.
1299120	1302120	That way you can build up to 10,000 hours of experience
1302120	1304040	and that's what helps you a lot.
1304040	1307080	Snowball your projects from a small snowball
1307080	1308440	all the way to a really big one
1308440	1310920	and actually make change in the world.
1310920	1313760	So in summary, that's I think how it works
1313760	1317720	like on a high level and the message is just keep hacking.
1317720	1318560	That's it.
1318560	1323560	And then hopefully, this is the future
1327440	1328280	that we're gonna build together
1328280	1329480	when we snowball all of our stuff
1329480	1330720	or something like that,
1330720	1333280	but not the first picture I showed, hopefully.
1333280	1334680	And that's it, thank you.
1334680	1335520	Thank you.
1340020	1342360	Andre Karparthi, everybody.
1342360	1344520	Thank you, Andre, that was awesome.
1344520	1345600	Thank you, thank you.
1346440	1351560	All right, let's get to those pitches.
1351560	1353520	The grand prize, coming up,
1353520	1355880	you're gonna hear eight pitches by eight projects
1355880	1359240	filtered through 290 submissions.
1359240	1360320	Narrow it down to eight
1360320	1362460	so you're all gonna see some cool stuff.
1362460	1365520	The grand prize is $25,000 investment
1365520	1368440	and actual term sheet from the Berkeley Skydeck Fund.
1368440	1372040	They must commit to hacking all summer on their project
1372040	1374000	and they must appropriately form,
1374000	1375680	of course, a legal entity.
1375680	1377320	How do you get money otherwise?
1377320	1380720	All right, I would like to now tell you briefly
1380720	1382640	about how this is gonna go.
1382640	1385960	Eight projects, as I said, three minute pitch.
1385960	1386920	You guys ready?
1386920	1387840	Three minutes?
1387840	1389640	Yes, they're ready.
1389640	1393120	The judges will then provide three minutes of feedback
1393120	1395440	and then after all the pitches,
1395440	1399520	the grand judges will go and deliberate and pick a winner.
1399520	1401540	Well, we show you some other cool stuff.
1401540	1404380	All right, I would like to introduce now
1404380	1406380	to great applause, everybody, please,
1406380	1409340	because we have an incredible panel of judges.
1409340	1410900	We are so pleased to have them.
1410900	1413340	Please welcome our first judge, Brian Boardley,
1413340	1415660	with the Berkeley Skydeck Fund.
1415660	1416820	Welcome, Brian.

1435220	1436500	Welcome, Irving.
1439420	1441940	Kurt Kuitzer, UC Berkeley faculty
1441940	1443500	and serial entrepreneur.
1443500	1444620	Welcome, Kurt.
1445820	1448060	And Mark Nitzberg, Berkeley faculty
1448060	1449780	and director of the UC Berkeley Center
1449780	1452180	for Human Compatible AI.
1452180	1453580	Thank you, judges.
1455860	1458060	All right, we got eight startups.
1458060	1460500	Warming up backstage.
1460540	1462740	Let's give them a little drum roll.
1462740	1464900	Let's give them a little drum roll.
1464900	1466060	We can get them going.
1466060	1468140	I first have to hear if the slide's up.
1468140	1469500	The slide is up first.
1469500	1470740	Are you ready?
1470740	1471580	You ready?
1472460	1474020	Are you ready?
1474020	1474940	Yes!
1474940	1477460	Please give everybody a warm round of applause.
1477460	1478780	They've been up all night hacking
1478780	1480100	and they're ready to share with you.
1480100	1482780	Please welcome the first project, Revision.
1482780	1484740	Come on out, come on out, Revision.
1484740	1485580	Yes, Danica!
1493740	1495020	Yes, the mic.
1495020	1495940	That'd be helpful.
1498020	1498980	Yeah, thank you.
1498980	1500780	So good evening, everyone.
1500780	1504020	It's my pleasure here on behalf of my team also
1504020	1506020	for the Revision project.
1506020	1507260	And my name is Danica.
1507260	1509580	I'm a rising senior studying computer science
1509580	1510620	at UC Berkeley.
1510620	1512420	We have masters of design students
1512420	1514220	as well as data science students on our team.
1514300	1517580	And we're really excited to tell you about our project.
1517580	1519860	So our project, we're focusing on building
1519860	1522940	an AI co-pilot tool for STEM textbook authors
1522940	1525340	capable of detecting and mitigating bias
1525340	1528740	in textbooks to create inclusive education content.
1528740	1531180	And there is a reason why we're doing this.
1531180	1533740	When considering overall representation of scientists
1533740	1538740	across textbooks, only 13.1% were women
1538780	1542300	compared to 86.9% men in a 2020 study
1542300	1545060	that featured seven of the most frequently used
1545060	1547820	biology textbooks within the US.
1547820	1550300	And on average, people of color only appear
1550300	1553100	every 320 pages of text, while white figures
1553100	1557460	observed every 24 pages across 10 college STEM textbooks
1557460	1560060	published between 2016 and 2020.
1561180	1563620	So we thought about this problem deep and hard
1563620	1565220	and it has been something that I've seen
1565220	1566700	from my personal studies.
1566700	1568660	And starting from elementary school to middle school,
1568660	1571780	we constantly see different examples of word problems
1571780	1574340	in other situations where text is always there.
1574340	1577220	And it's not always reflective of the actual true history.
1577220	1579540	And this research has been done by numerous scientists
1579540	1581260	who have gone through this process
1581260	1583620	of identifying people creating databases,
1583620	1585420	but there is just no current fix that,
1585420	1588500	and no one is really hoping to create this problem,
1588500	1591780	but there is no current fix that helps address this problem.
1591780	1593580	So the textbook companies actually
1593580	1596620	is who our team identified as our buying customer.
1596620	1599340	The current revision process actually takes six to 12 months
1599340	1601380	of a committee of five or more full-time employees
1601380	1602540	working on bias checks.
1602540	1604820	And the issue here is that employees
1604820	1606780	are actually not experts on their topic.
1606780	1609380	They also bring in their personal biases as well.
1609380	1612300	So our tool would come in right in between the writing
1612300	1617100	and revising part of this entire cycle
1617100	1620180	that developers go through when writing textbooks.
1621220	1623540	So again, here is our competitor analysis.
1623540	1625940	I'm sure many of you have used Turnitin or Grammarly
1625940	1627860	when you're submitting even essays.
1627860	1629780	And we really think that there needs to be
1629780	1631900	an additional check here for bias
1631900	1634980	and checking gender, racial, political, and other biases
1634980	1637540	and making this process affordable and automatic.
1637540	1642540	So it's not a costly process for anyone.
1642860	1644660	And throughout this process,
1644660	1646700	we're addressing supply chain diversity.
1646700	1648380	So starting from a younger age,
1648380	1650460	the elementary school students could be able
1650460	1652580	to use textbooks that truly reflect
1652580	1655380	the true history as well as themselves.
1655380	1656940	And here is our prototype.
1656940	1660580	So we have our text box here on the left side of the screen
1660580	1662860	where you get to show in real time
1662860	1664780	the examples of some sort of text
1664780	1667420	that a writer is creating at the moment.
1667420	1669500	And on the right, we have an overall score
1669500	1672700	and the bias checks for different categories.
1672700	1674820	And we're using machine learning models on the back end
1674820	1677620	to actually identify as well as LLMs.
1678740	1683700	And I'm not sure if I can play the prototype, but, oh.
1683700	1685020	Okay, yeah, it does play.
1685060	1687940	So essentially you can click through the different links
1687940	1689660	to see the breakdown.
1689660	1692140	And once you actually highlight one of these,
1692140	1696060	we are also adding in an API through a couple
1696060	1699500	of the sponsors here, such as Hume API and more,
1699500	1702940	to actually identify emotional analysis as well
1702940	1704540	in the textbook writing.
1704540	1705700	And in addition to this,
1705700	1707100	we're hoping to build a chat bot
1707100	1710780	that can actually help you also bring in databases
1710780	1713060	from the unrecognized scientists
1713060	1716140	and being able to sort of represent it.
1716140	1718780	Because bias actually exists in three different ways.
1718780	1721300	One of them is through actual text
1721300	1725420	such as representing firefighters would be nicer
1725420	1726900	than saying fireman.
1726900	1731180	And the other way is the entire tone and emotional analysis,
1731180	1733140	which is why our team used Hume API
1733140	1736220	to actually detect that emotional component.
1736220	1738220	And the third one is mitigating bias.
1738220	1741220	So we also considered adding in the chat bot.
1741260	1744380	So say, for example, if you want to highlight scientists
1744380	1747220	that are like, for example, contributing to physics,
1747220	1749660	you wouldn't just say list a few male scientists
1749660	1750500	and call it a day.
1750500	1752540	We would also suggest equivalent contributions
1752540	1754740	of female scientists as well.
1754740	1756860	So please join me and our team
1756860	1759580	in revisioning our future of education and work.
1759580	1760420	Thank you.
1760420	1770260	So I think everybody in communication today,
1770260	1772820	nonprofit or profit is concerned about diversity.
1772820	1775460	So it seems like you have a much larger market
1775460	1780540	than just textbook educators.
1780540	1783580	Also a comment on kind of like market sizing and whatnot.
1783580	1785820	I would think about, you know, potential ways
1785820	1787140	you could expand the market here,
1787140	1789540	because the number of people who are involved
1789540	1791980	in writing textbooks is a relatively small group.
1791980	1793580	But one way to think about it is like maybe
1793580	1796180	in this new era of AI generated content,
1796180	1798540	a much wider array of people can be part
1798580	1800580	of this textbook generation process.
1800580	1801740	So that's one thing.
1801740	1803740	And then I would also maybe consider selling directly
1803740	1805260	to the consumers of textbooks.
1805260	1807540	Because in some sense, the bias we're talking about
1807540	1809340	is internalized on that side of the equation,
1809340	1811100	not on the manufacturer side.
1811100	1812620	And so they could be insensitive there
1812620	1814580	for want to pay for something like this.
1814580	1815420	Yeah, definitely.
1815420	1816380	That's something we're considering.
1816380	1818740	So like the textbook would be our official bias
1818740	1819820	that we're marketing to,
1819820	1822180	but eventually it would be more of like a grammarly checker
1822180	1824540	type of tool that anyone can use.
1824540	1826340	Yeah, I had a similar comment on TAM
1826420	1827580	and market opportunity.
1827580	1831020	And as you think about just how a textbook
1831020	1832540	gets put into production,
1832540	1834820	that if you actually had it as a tool for
1834820	1837460	whether it's news or other areas,
1837460	1839420	you'd have more velocity,
1839420	1842100	both in terms of getting the data to improve your models,
1842100	1844660	but also greater impact.
1849380	1850500	Yeah, I'll just, I'll just like as well.
1850500	1852100	I mean, similar, I think everyone here
1852100	1854820	is kind of hitting the theme of how do we think bigger?
1854820	1856300	So even enterprises, right?
1856300	1858140	Like companies sending out communications
1858140	1859340	internally or externally.
1859340	1861300	I know this, this, this problem exists everywhere.
1861300	1863660	So that's kind of where my brain would go to.
1866580	1868260	Okay, thank you.
1868260	1869100	Thank you.
1869100	1869940	Thank you.
1869940	1870780	Thank you.
1870780	1871620	Thank you.
1876420	1877780	Whoops.
1877780	1878900	Agent OS.
1878900	1880540	Please welcome Agent OS.
1886380	1887220	Hey there everyone.
1887220	1888260	My name is Shashank.
1888260	1890060	I'm here today with my friends,
1890060	1891580	Uggum and Drew Buhuja,
1891580	1893260	somewhere in the crowd over here.
1893260	1895140	We built today Agent OS.
1896700	1897940	Picture this.
1897940	1898900	You work at a hair salon
1898900	1900780	and you guys are bombarded every single day
1900780	1902740	and every single year by your accounting
1902740	1905060	and tax preparation qualms.
1905060	1906620	These are things that are very hard to deal with
1906620	1908220	and you've heard of tools like OpenAI,
1908220	1912340	ChatGPT, LLM this, ChatGPT that, everything.
1912340	1913580	But you have no clue where to start
1913580	1914780	using these technologies.
1914820	1916940	And that's no fault of your own.
1916940	1919460	The current state of the technology right now
1919460	1922540	is very bad at multi-functionary tasks.
1922540	1925060	More so, it's very hard as an individual developer,
1925060	1926740	sometimes even non-technical,
1926740	1929780	to even get started with even the simplest automations
1929780	1932340	or workflows or tools with such LLMs.
1932340	1935220	Even engineers with years on years of experience
1935220	1938340	in this space take tens of hundreds and hours
1938340	1940020	and even thousands and thousands of dollars
1940020	1942380	to even get started to build something.
1942420	1945980	This is where Agent OS completely transforms the landscape.
1945980	1949620	With Agent OS, you're able to create multi-agent workflows
1949620	1952100	in a matter of seconds from natural language.
1952100	1953500	What does that even mean?
1953500	1955620	Take your average corporate org structure.
1955620	1957300	You have your managers, you have your workers
1957300	1959100	and sometimes you even have your interns.
1959100	1960900	Everyone is really good at what they do.
1960900	1962740	They have their tools, their skills.
1962740	1965140	Let's say John is really good at charting
1965140	1966380	and making PowerPoints.
1966380	1969200	Let's say Steve is really good at Python coding.
1969200	1971120	Everyone's really good at what they do.
1971120	1974040	In this, you have a very collaborative working together
1974040	1975880	to create this common solution
1975880	1977720	for someone coming from higher up.
1977720	1980000	That's how Agent OS was designed.
1980000	1981560	Our engineers, Dhruv and Uggum,
1981560	1985160	were able to replicate this human collaborative process
1985160	1987680	to programmatically using LLMs.
1987680	1988760	What does this do?
1988760	1991140	This allows everyone from the common Joe
1991140	1993000	all the way up to enterprise clients
1993000	1996680	to be able to interact and use these multi-agent,
1996680	1998880	agentic workflows in their day-to-day life
1998920	2001240	to improve their quality of life or productivity,
2001240	2003760	in all in a matter of seconds and a few sentences.
2004680	2007040	Let's go back to the study of the hair salon.
2007040	2010520	In the process of doing your taxes and accounting,
2010520	2011760	you have multiple steps.
2011760	2013440	You have your collection from your receipts
2013440	2015960	and your invoices, you have calculating your cash flow,
2015960	2017640	all the calculations you have to do,
2017640	2019120	you have to manage your workers
2019120	2021000	and then you also have to do your general summary.
2021000	2022300	What about your insights for the year,
2022300	2024320	how you were spending, what you were spending on
2024320	2026160	and you have to also do a lot of clustering
2026160	2027480	and analytics on this.
2027520	2029400	This is a very complex workflow
2029400	2031760	that's nearly impossible for modern-day LLMs
2031760	2033480	at the current state to do right now.
2033480	2035280	You can take chat, GPT, you ask it a question
2035280	2036680	for even more than three things,
2036680	2038060	it'll forget what the first thing was
2038060	2039360	by the time you're at the second.
2039360	2040680	It doesn't work that way.
2040680	2042640	With AgentOS, this completely changes
2042640	2045280	where you're able to have these complex workflows.
2045280	2047640	Let's dive into another demo.
2047640	2049760	So let's say I'm an analyst at JP Morgan
2049760	2052400	and my boss tells me every morning I want a report
2052400	2057080	of XYZ stock in the morning, a detailed report on paper.
2057080	2058560	How do I do that?
2058560	2059840	I use AgentOS.
2059840	2061840	On this screen you can see a bunch of other complex
2061840	2065080	use cases of multiple agents working together collaboratively
2065080	2067400	but in the tool box, in the search bar,
2067400	2069480	you can see the use case of the analyst.
2069480	2072240	Here I have to do market research, livestock data,
2072240	2075140	I have to search the internet, go on Yahoo Finance,
2075140	2076360	then I have to create my analysis,
2076360	2078600	technical analysis, qualitative analysis,
2078600	2081080	then I have to do what my boss is telling me to do
2081080	2083400	and after all of that I have to create charts,
2083400	2085200	graphs and visualizations.
2085240	2087840	Here you can build tools using natural language
2087840	2089920	like the one right there that says write me a tool
2089920	2092600	that fetches the meta stock price from Yahoo Finance.
2092600	2095240	In a matter of seconds, the common Joe or anyone
2095240	2098120	is able to create that tool, connect them to workers.
2098120	2100360	You can think of workers as your everyday employees,
2100360	2103520	agents, people that perform these actions using the tools
2103520	2105320	and then connect them to super teams
2105320	2108480	and these teams are able to, on the screen you see four
2108480	2111160	but you can scale this up to 40, 400,
2111160	2114440	basically complex, vertical and horizontal organizations
2114480	2116720	that are able to perform complex decision making
2116720	2119480	and complex analyses for anyone,
2119480	2120760	from enterprise to consumer.
2121880	2122800	What does this do?
2122800	2124920	With a multi-agent, multi-team framework,
2124920	2127240	this completely opens the landscape up for anyone
2127240	2129840	and everyone to take on the power of LLMs
2129840	2132720	into their own hands from natural language.
2132720	2135280	Take your average farmer at a farmer's market.
2135280	2137680	He's trying to create his marketing campaign
2137680	2139680	for the upcoming farmer's market this Sunday.
2139680	2142040	He has no clue where to start looking at his metrics,
2142040	2143880	looking at the customers, looking at the weather
2144000	2146960	and creating these brochures, papers, pamphlets and whatnot.
2146960	2149560	With one line and one minute using Agent OS,
2149560	2151760	he can create all the documentation he needs
2151760	2155000	in order to enact this stuff and be able to perform successfully
2155000	2157880	and continually grow his business at his farmer's market.
2157880	2160440	Things like this are completely opened up with Agent OS
2160440	2163120	and we hope to completely democratize the process
2163120	2166320	of using LLMs at all scales, at all geographies
2166320	2169400	and all use cases within sentences and seconds.
2169400	2170240	Thank you.
2170240	2185080	That's a compelling proposition.
2185080	2196480	The one thing that I worry about is right now the agents are the LLMs,
2196520	2204600	you know, performing these tasks and there's a certain question
2204600	2207560	about the veracity and reliability of what they're doing.
2207560	2210760	And so I think that in a future
2210760	2214800	where we have that reliability, this would make perfect sense,
2214800	2220280	but I would want to add a kind of tandem subject matter expert,
2220280	2225320	maybe looking over the shoulder of each of the agents.
2225320	2227680	I think next time I hear this pitch, I'd love to hear
2227680	2230200	about the one market you're going to crush.
2230200	2234720	It's hard for me to imagine serving a hairstylist one day
2234720	2238120	and Morgan Stanley analysts the next.
2238120	2244760	This is a huge opportunity and a big bold mission that you have.
2244760	2248640	I would want to dig a bit deeper into your tech staff
2248640	2250280	and the people you have on your team
2250280	2253760	because these are really complex problems and issues
2253760	2260360	and also agree that what would be your first area of focus
2260360	2265320	because it's pretty broad and wide.
2265320	2268480	I'll say I kind of like the broad focus and there's a lot
2268480	2272640	of individual startups tackling each of these individual problems.
2272640	2276080	If it's invoicing or research, it might be interesting to figure
2276080	2279840	out how to like loop in all these other tools that are out there
2279840	2281800	and really kind of just be like an interface layer
2281840	2286600	and let these other companies solve the technical challenges.
2286600	2289920	I think the value proposition of creating multi-agent workflows
2289920	2292480	in a matter of seconds is really compelling.
2292480	2294440	I think the next step would be trying to figure
2294440	2297480	out how can you go from simply performing these tasks
2297480	2298920	to becoming the best at these tasks.
2298920	2301400	So for example, going after the outliers,
2301400	2303560	sort of the thesis around coaching networks.
2303560	2306600	Some startups do this and they do it better for like certain
2306600	2307600	verticals and others.
2307600	2311160	So I think doing more research around that could be really
2311160	2312840	compelling.
2312840	2315080	The only thing I would add is just think about, you know,
2315080	2317560	enterprise security and how you solve for that.
2317560	2320080	There's a lot of authenticates and authorization you're going
2320080	2321240	to have to do for all these agents.
2321240	2325680	So just have an answer for that.
2325680	2326720	Well, yeah, thank you so much.
2326720	2328360	Thank you, everyone.
2328360	2332120	Thank you, Agent OS.
2332120	2334480	All right, next up, Skyline.
2334480	2336680	Come on out, Skyline.
2336680	2343920	Hey, everyone.
2343920	2346800	Hey, so my name is Rajan and I'm a first year student
2346800	2348080	at the University of Waterloo
2348080	2349720	and I study software engineering.
2349720	2351440	And I fundamentally believe
2351440	2354280	that cities shouldn't be static.
2354280	2357080	They should optimize and scale for the people
2357080	2358360	who inhabit them.
2358360	2359600	And so we built Skyline.
2359600	2363600	Skyline is an optimizer and it allows you
2363600	2366440	to better understand how to model cities,
2366440	2370880	using agents, and optimize things like traffic and transit
2370880	2374240	to inherently increase mobility
2374240	2377040	and reduce things like carbon emissions.
2377040	2380320	So this is a very weird problem that we solved.
2380320	2383520	But I want to walk through the case study of Los Angeles.
2383520	2386360	So Los Angeles is one of the largest carbon emitters
2386360	2389280	in North America, this most because of their transit,
2389280	2391200	because of the amount of cars.
2391200	2393920	And so what are ways in which we can optimize this?
2393960	2395640	Well, let's look directly at the people
2395640	2397440	who inhabit Los Angeles.
2397440	2400320	We can extract census data, things like age.
2400320	2402760	We can look at things like gender.
2402760	2404280	We can look at things like income.
2404280	2406320	We can find population density graphs.
2406320	2409400	And using this information, we can start to find patterns.
2409400	2413520	Specifically, what we did is we created 500 distinct agents.
2413520	2417400	Each agent is a different citizen with different interests.
2417400	2418800	And what we can do is we can give them
2418800	2421040	each their own chain of thought.
2421080	2423960	Each person here has their own day in their life.
2423960	2426400	For example, this person is a very young,
2426400	2429640	I believe this was a 22-year-old with a very large income.
2429640	2432880	He's a long day at work, and after work, he goes to the gym.
2432880	2435560	We can now reason about what this person may do
2435560	2438280	and now model this on a map.
2438280	2440400	Now, once we have how these different agents
2440400	2441920	are moving around, what we can do
2441920	2444520	is we can try and optimize things like transit.
2444520	2447520	So what we do here is we have our own proximal policy
2447520	2450720	analyzer, and this allows us to create simulations.
2450720	2452440	What we believe to be the best way
2452440	2458040	to understand how we can move around from any point A and B
2458040	2461600	in the fastest way at the lowest carbon cost.
2461600	2464240	We use our own carbon cost analysis mechanisms,
2464240	2466760	our own machine learning models to better understand
2466760	2470000	how we may be emitting carbon and how
2470000	2471880	to reduce this through our transit.
2471880	2473600	So this is a lot that is through you,
2473600	2475680	and I think the best way for me to represent this to you
2475680	2476760	is through a video.
2476760	2477840	I hope this video loads.
2481160	2482360	It's possible to play the video.
2486040	2488480	So what we first do is we have an agent-based simulation.
2488480	2491880	These are 500 distinct things in parallel that are running.
2491880	2493840	Now they each go around throughout their day,
2493840	2495760	and what we can do is we can define patterns
2495760	2497200	in how they move around.
2497200	2499120	Now the best part is what we can do
2499120	2501560	is now that they're all back in their original position,
2501560	2504120	we can start a generation of transit.
2504120	2506400	And we're using these patterns to now generate
2506400	2508920	live different transit systems that we
2508920	2510720	believe to be the most optimal.
2510720	2514280	So what Skyline is, we're not a company that
2514280	2516280	does analysis of transit.
2516280	2518640	We are a human modeling company, and that
2518640	2521800	allows us to better understand and better predict
2521800	2523480	how things around us will change and how
2523480	2526880	it can optimize them using these patterns.
2526880	2529480	Yeah, so that's Skyline.
2529480	2531480	Happy to take any of the back.
2531480	2532480	Thank you.
2542480	2542980	Wow.
2547000	2551760	I just want to observe that what you're
2551760	2556640	doing in creating a sort of digital twin of a city
2556640	2564680	is essentially the each citizen is
2564680	2569760	being simulated using one of these really powerful,
2569760	2572560	expensive things, a language model.
2572560	2578120	And it will be probably an important step
2578120	2584080	to draw from the language model some of the statistics that
2584080	2586320	are actually fed in in the first place
2586320	2591440	to make sure you're getting out something representative.
2591440	2594480	But that's very impressive.
2594480	2596520	Yeah, yeah, similar comment.
2596520	2598920	I think there's all sorts of economic theory
2598920	2601440	about agents and modeling their behavior
2601440	2602600	and their values and whatnot.
2602600	2604240	And the thing that usually gets you
2604240	2606760	is the sort of heterogeneity across the population.
2606760	2608920	And so making sure that that actually represents
2608920	2611280	the populations being modeled is important.
2611280	2613320	And then the other thing also related to value,
2613320	2615560	I would think about it as just value capture
2615600	2617120	for your own sake, because I feel like this
2617120	2620920	is a category of software where the economic impact of this
2620920	2621720	could be massive.
2621720	2624640	But how much of that do you get to capture as a software renderer
2624640	2626160	is less clear to me?
2626160	2629480	But it's very interesting.
2629480	2632800	I guess I would be curious about maybe some more nuanced
2632800	2637320	enterprise use cases as well, if it's concerts or security
2637320	2638640	or stadiums.
2638640	2641400	So just thinking about are there more micro use cases
2641400	2645120	that there's a more direct ROI with for this sort
2645200	2647040	of modeling?
2647040	2649440	Yeah, we tried to consider ourselves
2649440	2651240	to be a human modeling software.
2651240	2653800	And this is just one of the most visual applications,
2653800	2654600	which is strength.
2659880	2660760	Awesome, thank you so much.
2660760	2661760	Thank you.
2661760	2663000	Thank you.
2663000	2665560	Thank you, Skyline.
2665560	2672720	All right, next up, we have Spark.
2672720	2673600	Please welcome Spark.
2675120	2679840	Hi, how's everyone?
2679840	2681200	How's Cali?
2681200	2683400	We are Spark, and we're giving a voice
2683400	2687360	to new entrepreneurs, young entrepreneurs.
2687360	2690960	So let's admit it, cold calling is really hard.
2690960	2693640	I mean, resources are hard to get.
2693640	2695280	It's a steep learning curve.
2695280	2697400	And getting attention is hard.
2697400	2699680	If you've cold called someone, you know, they don't have time.
2699680	2702000	They'll say, oh, sorry, call me back later.
2702000	2702720	I mean, they're busy.
2702720	2703400	Everyone's busy.
2703400	2704320	We have things to do.
2704320	2706560	So we have to figure out how can we
2706560	2709960	earn the time of working people.
2709960	2711760	There's existing solutions.
2711760	2714600	It's long and arduous for trial and error.
2714600	2716640	It's expensive for a sales coach.
2716640	2719600	And finally, if you have a sales partner,
2719600	2723320	chemistry isn't easy if you're just meeting them, right?
2723320	2724640	Well, we have a process.
2724640	2727720	You upload a transcript to our software.
2727720	2730080	We go through and analyze the emotion.
2730080	2735200	We aggregate this data, and we give you productive feedback.
2735200	2736400	Who's our target market?
2736400	2738000	Well, look around.
2738000	2739600	You guys are our target market.
2739600	2742480	People who are engineers, people who love to build,
2742480	2745160	and say this weekend you made some sort of product
2745160	2746200	you want to sell.
2746200	2749540	You don't have much experience with sales or outreach.
2749540	2752720	With our software, you can record your cold outreach,
2752720	2754560	and we can tell you what you've done right
2754560	2757440	and how you can improve to hopefully land your product
2757440	2759840	where it needs to be.
2759840	2762640	And later on, we want to expand to call centers and sales
2762640	2765440	staffs, because we think we can spread this
2765440	2769320	across an organization, and it can be highly profitable.
2769320	2774680	We have usage-based tiering, so $0.75 a minute for 1,000 hours,
2774680	2778480	going up to $0.40 for $10,000.
2778480	2780880	So this is our software.
2780880	2782960	And I want to tell you guys a story.
2782960	2786060	I started being an entrepreneur around six months ago,
2786060	2788960	and we made an AI body cam analysis startup.
2788960	2792080	So I did 100 phone calls, 100 cold calls.
2792080	2796720	I got no clients, 200, 300, 500, and 700.
2796720	2799080	No one was responding to me.
2799080	2803440	So by 800, I got actually three, and I realized something.
2803440	2805460	The human brain is pretty amazing.
2805460	2807320	We're able to pick up on patterns,
2807320	2809920	but at the same time, it's kind of inefficient,
2809920	2812920	because it took 800.
2812920	2816480	Here, we look at the emotion between every single sentence,
2816480	2819000	and we figure out spikes of emotion and decreasing
2819000	2820360	emotions.
2820360	2823040	We see that when we talk about security and data privacy
2823040	2826600	with police officers, it shows an increase in their interest.
2826600	2829600	And this was a trend among many conversations we had.
2829600	2834640	So in our analysis page, we see in the top left
2834640	2838320	that mentioning AI accuracy and efficiency, increased officer
2838320	2841080	safety, and discussing cost savings
2841080	2844160	really helped us when we were talking to officers,
2844160	2846240	because we're some college students, right?
2846240	2849240	We're dealing with some pretty confidential data.
2849240	2852480	Bringing this up early really helped improve our rates.
2852480	2855200	And the four things you see here in the corners
2855200	2858240	are the different triggers we generated automatically
2858240	2860320	based on the cold calls we had.
2860320	2865280	So one is positive reactions, negative reactions,
2865280	2868400	deescalating tense situations, and normalizing
2868400	2870320	exciting situations.
2870320	2874480	We also generate insights, too, based on whatever cold calling
2874480	2876760	trends you make.
2876760	2880320	We also have a rag, so you can upload your company knowledge,
2880320	2882840	your target audience, and your pricing information.
2882840	2885640	So if you make a mistake, don't worry, we got your back.
2885640	2888480	We'll tell you, hey, maybe instead of saying this,
2888480	2890760	you could have said this, because it might have helped you
2890760	2891640	out a little bit.
2894080	2895760	Sorry, my team picture isn't on here,
2895760	2898720	but thank you to Tushar, and Nick, and Krishna.
2898720	2900200	You guys were a great team.
2900200	2902480	And I'm honored to be here representing you guys today.
2902480	2903440	I'm open to feedback.
2903440	2913120	I guess I need to be the first person
2913120	2917920	to say that you're entering a pretty competitive market
2917920	2919520	with other offerings here.
2923480	2925000	I'll say something that stuck out to me
2925000	2927840	was this idea of insights.
2927840	2930720	But I think at an organization, there's
2930720	2932800	going to be a sales team, and a marketing team,
2932840	2934760	and an online web team.
2934760	2936560	And those teams don't really talk to each other,
2936560	2938680	so maybe it's interesting to think about how do you pull
2938680	2941960	insights from one channel of sales or marketing
2941960	2943920	and actually bring that into another channel.
2943920	2946040	So maybe the insights from cold calling
2946040	2948240	are actually influencing what's going on the website.
2948240	2952320	Maybe there's some interesting spots of opportunity there.
2952320	2954360	Yeah, I can actually talk about one facet of this.
2954360	2956600	We want to explore deeply.
2956600	2957720	I want to give you an example.
2957720	2959960	Say we have three founders in the company, right?
2959960	2962680	I have a first cold call with one person,
2962720	2964720	and later on, my second co-founder
2964720	2967040	wants to set up a warmer call in the future.
2967040	2969600	And then my third founder wants to set up a third call.
2969600	2973640	We want to build a profile for this client as they go along,
2973640	2975280	so we can truly understand them.
2975280	2977920	And also, we want to develop a profile on ourselves, too,
2977920	2979960	so we can learn more about ourselves as we go
2979960	2983840	and how we're behaving, make sure that we're learning as we go.
2983840	2987800	So we're thinking, if we develop a CRM on top of this data
2987800	2990600	that we leverage, then we can connect multiple teams
2990600	2993320	and enable cross-functional benefit.
2995520	2996800	Yeah, I had a similar comment.
2996800	2998480	I think it would be really game-changing
2998480	3001160	if, in addition to some of the real-time analyses
3001160	3003120	your guys are doing around sentiment,
3003120	3007560	where you can see the system with information on prior calls
3007560	3010040	or this person's particular strengths and weaknesses
3010040	3013320	and how they compliment those of the other people on the team
3013320	3017200	and to really build a CRM, this knowledge graph around
3017200	3019360	each person's strengths and weaknesses on the team
3019360	3021240	to be able to better fine-tune the system.
3021240	3022920	Yeah, thank you. You guys saw the analysis,
3022920	3026440	but also, there's a long list of past conversations.
3026440	3028600	You can actually go into every single conversation
3028600	3030880	you've ever had and look at it deeply,
3030880	3033600	the same way you did in the latest conversation.
3034920	3038280	I would think about the full sales funnel.
3038280	3040600	This is pretty deep down in it.
3040600	3042760	And as you think about,
3042760	3045560	where are you really going to be able to convert
3045560	3049200	or where's the wedge that really matters?
3049200	3053400	Because there's a lot that goes into converting a sale
3053400	3054760	and it's not just the cold call.
3054760	3057880	So is the issue, are you actually calling the right people?
3057880	3060960	Or is the issue, are you actually speaking
3060960	3062280	to the right decision-makers?
3062280	3065840	So just thinking more broadly about that funnel
3065840	3069400	and where you might actually be able to have the most impact
3069400	3074400	and have the right wedge into the broader products we.
3074600	3075800	Yeah, thanks.
3076760	3078800	Thank you. Thank you.
3078800	3079720	All right, thank you guys.
3079720	3080560	Thank you so much.
3080560	3081400	We appreciate it.
3081400	3082720	Bye, enjoy your questions.
3084440	3086680	Clicker, clicker.
3086680	3087520	Thank you.
3087520	3088880	Okay.
3088880	3091640	Next up, we have Hear Me Out.
3091640	3093440	Please welcome Hear Me Out.
3093440	3102520	All right, guys.
3102520	3104640	Hey, hi, my name is Marcus.
3104640	3105480	I'm from Hear Me Out.
3105480	3107680	And what we've built is an AI-driven
3107680	3109160	customer service pipeline,
3109160	3111560	optimizing call matching and visibility.
3111560	3113000	So that might leave you scratching your head.
3113000	3115600	So let's just talk about the problem.
3115600	3117080	So let me give you a bit of context.
3117080	3118120	I'm an exchange student
3118120	3120320	and when I first came here, I had to deal with so many things.
3120320	3121960	I had to deal with banking.
3121960	3123160	I had to deal with insurance.
3123160	3124480	I had to deal with deliveries.
3124480	3126680	And I even had my car break down on me
3126680	3128080	and that was a real pain.
3129480	3131280	In short, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number
3131280	3132440	of customer service calls
3132440	3133360	because for each of these things,
3133360	3136000	I had to make so many calls just to get things done.
3136000	3137800	And I think a lot of you guys can relate to that.
3137800	3140160	We've all had our fair share of bad call experiences
3140160	3141640	where we're upset,
3141640	3143600	the customer service representative is also upset
3143600	3145080	and nothing is done.
3145080	3146920	We've also had good experiences as well.
3146920	3147760	And I think that's the core
3147760	3149560	of what we're trying to tackle here.
3149560	3150840	We want to create a pipeline
3150840	3153760	that tries to provide optimal matching
3153760	3156560	and provide visibility on emotional data to businesses.
3157920	3159240	So we also did the research
3159240	3161440	and I think the numbers speak for itself.
3161440	3163360	This is a key problem with a sizable market
3163360	3166520	and a sheer number of people are affected by this as well.
3167720	3169480	And this is our problem statement, which is,
3169480	3172040	how might businesses which offer customer service calls
3172040	3174440	provide a better experience for their customers?
3175600	3178040	So we think we can tackle this in four key components.
3178040	3179880	First of all, an improved call bot.
3179880	3182000	We all are common with that initial robo call
3182000	3182840	that we have to deal with
3182840	3184920	and sometimes it's really, really frustrating.
3184920	3187080	How many times have the call bot talk to you
3187080	3189000	and it just doesn't direct you to the right person?
3189000	3191200	I think we've all experienced that before.
3191200	3193080	Second and third, and I think this comes hand in hand,
3193080	3194840	it's just business visibility.
3194840	3196920	We want to provide businesses with better visibility
3196920	3200320	of both call experiences data
3200320	3203360	as well as customer representatives bandwidths over the day
3203360	3205480	as they continue to take calls.
3205480	3208160	And finally, this is where we put those two together.
3208160	3210960	We want to take that data and optimize a customer's journey
3210960	3215280	through a better customer to service representative matching.
3215280	3218120	So I won't bore you with this data,
3218120	3220040	but with that in mind,
3220040	3222880	we developed a set of decoupled microservices
3222880	3225920	and I just want to point three key parts out to you.
3225920	3229080	So first of all, we want to assess customer agreeability
3229080	3230880	with an initial robo call,
3230880	3232840	but this won't just be your normal robo call.
3232840	3235360	We want to use Hume's EVI to manage the robo call
3235360	3236600	in an empathetic manner
3236600	3239200	such that it measures the customer's emotions
3239200	3240520	as they go through the call
3240520	3243360	and eventually outputs an agreeability score
3243360	3244200	for the customer.
3245160	3247680	Second of all, we have a call analysis feedback loop
3247680	3248920	and that's that whole thing on the right
3248920	3249960	that goes down below.
3249960	3252120	And what this does is once you have a call connected
3252120	3254040	between a customer and a representative,
3254040	3255520	it takes in multiple factors of data
3255520	3257160	such as the call duration,
3257160	3258760	the emotional change over the call
3258760	3260680	and the overall call outcome.
3260680	3262400	Using Hume's emotional measurement API,
3262400	3265040	we can then also generate a call score.
3265040	3267280	Finally, and this is the third and key part to this,
3267280	3268440	it's the matching API.
3268440	3270240	Using the two things that I just mentioned,
3270240	3271760	we can best match a customer
3271760	3273400	to a customer service representative
3273400	3275400	which matches their vibe, their energy
3275400	3278560	and their emotions based on how our custom model is developed.
3278560	3280480	So what's the outcome of all of this?
3280480	3282760	As a representative goes through their day,
3282760	3284960	their state changes depending on how their calls go
3284960	3287080	and they're bandwidth adjusts accordingly.
3287080	3288560	This affects the subsequent customers
3288560	3291320	which they are matched to in a positive manner
3291320	3293980	and creates a better experience for both parties.
3295280	3297040	So there's a lot more which we can build
3297040	3299320	with what we have, but with this foundational pipeline,
3299320	3300880	we believe we effectively tackle the problem
3300880	3302000	that needs to be solved.
3302000	3302840	That's all I have for today.
3302840	3303680	Thank you.
3303680	3304520	Thank you.
3312200	3313200	Nice.
3313200	3314040	Thank you.
3317400	3319080	Yeah, I mean a little bit of feedback
3319080	3320560	similar to the last company as well.
3320560	3323000	Just there's a lot of companies working in this space too.
3323000	3325560	So I would just continue to think through
3325560	3327680	how to find that core differentiation
3328880	3331800	if you continue to work on this after the hackathon.
3331800	3332920	Yeah, I completely agree.
3333000	3335960	I think a key part that we thought was really exciting
3335960	3338760	was just what you can achieve with custom models.
3338760	3340680	What we're doing by developing a feedback loop
3340680	3342680	is we're creating something where we can create,
3342680	3344680	in a sense, a model which trains itself.
3344680	3347120	We can assess how calls might improve
3347120	3349400	or get worse after the matching
3349400	3351560	and that feedback gets fed straight to the matching API
3351560	3353600	so that it knows whether or not it's done a good job or not.
3353600	3354760	And we find that really interesting
3354760	3356760	and we think that that's a key differentiating factor
3356760	3357760	which we can achieve.
3358760	3363160	There might be some opportunities for building
3363160	3366080	some sort of synthetic data pipeline here
3366080	3368120	where you could just sort of simulate calls
3368120	3372720	with an AI bot of some sort and use that as feedback.
3372720	3374360	I don't know how good that data will be or not
3374360	3376240	but it could be interesting.
3376240	3377440	Yeah, I know that's a really interesting thought.
3377440	3378280	Thank you.
3379400	3381000	I know right now you guys are targeting
3381000	3384280	customer service agents as well as call centers.
3384280	3385880	Something that could be interesting to think about
3386160	3388040	as you think about the different stages
3388040	3389840	of the software adoption lifecycle
3389840	3393320	as you go from your early adopters to your early majority
3393320	3394360	and then your late majority
3394360	3397000	who's eventually gonna justify your evaluation
3397000	3399560	in terms of what those ideal customer profiles
3399560	3401840	are going to look like down the line.
3401840	3403400	Yeah, thank you for that.
3403400	3407000	I think one key thing was we actually had a judge come to us
3407000	3408760	and talk to us about how they were doing something similar
3408760	3410520	for sales representatives as well
3410520	3411560	and we found that really interesting.
3411560	3413600	So happy to figure out how we can pivot
3413600	3414960	if that need arises.
3416880	3419200	Thank you so much.
3419200	3420520	Thank you.
3420520	3421720	Thank you, hear me out.
3422840	3426040	All right, next up we have Dispatch AI.
3426040	3427400	Please welcome Dispatch.
3435280	3438640	Hi everyone, my name is Spike and I'm with Dispatch AI.
3440400	3444200	In the United States, over 80% of 911 call centers
3444280	3446160	are critically understaffed.
3446160	3447800	This means that in a crisis,
3447800	3450520	people with real emergencies aren't able
3450520	3452160	to get the support they need
3452160	3454560	because all the human agents are busy
3455440	3457600	and they're often put on hold.
3457600	3460320	This is particularly an issue in our neighboring city
3460320	3464160	of Oakland where last year the average wait time
3464160	3467840	was over 60 seconds to pick up a 911 call.
3467840	3470880	Now in an emergency, every second counts
3470880	3472720	and this could be literally the difference
3472720	3474600	between life and death.
3474600	3478840	This is unacceptable and that's why we built Dispatch AI.
3478840	3482600	The world's first AI 911 call operator
3482600	3485480	designed to eliminate these wait times.
3486480	3489720	Our system is powered by two key components.
3489720	3491880	First is the voice AI.
3491880	3494520	The voice AI will step into calls
3494520	3496720	when all human agents are busy
3496720	3498840	and it will work with the caller
3498880	3503280	to evaluate their situation, extract the location
3503280	3506040	and optionally dispatch first responders
3506040	3507280	directly to the scene.
3508880	3512360	And the second part is our powerful dashboard
3512360	3514080	for the operator themselves.
3514080	3517240	So the operator will have access to a bird's eye view
3517240	3519400	of all of the ongoing calls
3519400	3522520	which will be automatically triaged by the AI
3522520	3525680	into different forms of severity or priority.
3525720	3528480	Further, they'll see that the AI
3528480	3531160	will automatically extract the location
3531160	3534480	and will provide a live transcript of the call
3534480	3536560	so that they can quickly see what's going on
3536560	3540080	and even step into the call once they're available.
3540080	3542680	Further, they have buttons that allow them
3542680	3544440	to directly, with just one click
3544440	3546200	because the location's already fetched,
3546200	3549920	dispatch police, firefighters or paramedics.
3549920	3553440	All of this is done from a human centric angle
3553440	3555040	and the way how we achieve this
3555040	3558400	is by taking into account the caller's emotions.
3558400	3562180	So for instance, when a caller shows signs of anxiety
3562180	3565520	or fear, the system could work more to calm them down
3565520	3566640	and make them feel at ease
3566640	3569720	before taking the next safe step.
3569720	3571880	This system is fully designed
3571880	3574720	with ethical safe guides in mind
3574720	3578000	and part of that was fine tuning a model
3578000	3581400	on over 50911 calls
3581400	3583800	so that it could understand the proper protocols
3583840	3588840	and be knowledgeable on a wide variety of possible scenarios
3591280	3593560	in which a 911 operator could assist in,
3593560	3596440	including fake calls or instances
3596440	3598240	where it may not need assistance.
3599640	3602080	This is all powered by our innovative tech stack
3602080	3604400	that utilizes a variety of AI components,
3604400	3608760	including the voice AI, the emotional analysis
3608760	3610860	and of course a key component of this,
3610860	3612680	the fine tuning itself.
3612680	3616280	Our mission is to make requesting emergency services
3616280	3618660	more effective and efficient.
3618660	3620000	Thank you.
3620000	3630700	I'll go first.
3630700	3632880	I thought you did a great job.
3632880	3635120	I thought you presented the problem set,
3635120	3637880	the opportunity and the product very clearly.
3638880	3639960	It only had three minutes,
3639960	3642040	but you hit all the relevant points.
3642040	3642880	Thank you.
3645080	3647040	The one thing I would encourage you
3647040	3648760	to think about a little bit is
3649720	3652640	sort of like the optimization function
3652640	3654440	for these municipalities, right?
3654440	3656480	Cause if people in Oakland are waiting 60 seconds
3656480	3658520	to get their 911 call answered,
3658520	3659960	like there's a reason for that.
3659960	3660800	I don't know what that is,
3660800	3662480	but somehow these municipalities have decided
3662480	3664160	that that's how they want it to be.
3664160	3666920	And so I would just think about like,
3666920	3669280	you know, as you bring in AI to this problem,
3669280	3671760	doing the like potentially difficult AB tests
3671800	3673160	of making sure that whatever it is
3673160	3674880	that these municipalities are actually optimizing for
3674880	3676440	is actually improved by this.
3676440	3678600	Cause it seems like a no-brainer when you first say it,
3678600	3681760	but like clearly it's this way for some reason
3681760	3684200	that it's probably nuanced and tricky.
3684200	3685800	So just something to think about.
3692080	3693240	Any other feedback?
3695240	3696240	Just following up on that,
3696240	3698040	I think the key is ease of adoption.
3698040	3699040	I mean, I think you,
3699040	3701640	it's easy going to be easy to make a productivity argument
3701640	3703320	to the city of Oakland,
3703320	3706200	but then you got to think about who's actually installing,
3706200	3708440	who's paying for this and who's installing it.
3712320	3713160	Okay, that's good.
3713160	3714360	Thank you so much.
3714360	3715200	Thank you.
3715200	3717560	He just batch.
3719200	3720760	All right.
3720760	3724880	And next up, we have ASL Brigify.
3724880	3726480	Please welcome ASL Brigify.
3732640	3734280	Hello, my name is Isha
3734280	3737080	and today I'll be presenting ASL Brigify,
3737080	3741040	the next generation of sign language and interactive learning.
3742600	3743440	Oh.
3749000	3750560	Oh, this?
3750560	3751640	Okay.
3751640	3752520	Sorry.
3752520	3754680	So what was the inspiration behind this?
3754680	3757480	Well, ASL is the third most studied language
3757480	3759000	after Spanish and English
3759000	3761040	and over a billion people are projected
3761040	3763680	to have some sort of hearing loss deficiency,
3763680	3765680	which is why it's even more important
3765680	3768480	to have a seamless way of for people
3768480	3769880	with hearing loss deficiencies
3769880	3773160	to communicate with people without them and vice versa.
3773160	3776720	And next, there's over a 15,000% return on investment
3776720	3778360	over a 10 year period,
3778360	3780480	demonstrating the value proposition
3780480	3783280	and existing platforms like Duolingo surprisingly
3783280	3785840	do not take into account ASL learning,
3785840	3787800	which is why it's important to build
3788280	3791760	an interactive platform where individuals
3791760	3795080	can retrieve the accuracy of their signed texts
3795080	3797320	as well as characters.
3802160	3805600	Now, our solution includes three proprietary AI models.
3805600	3807560	First, we use random forest,
3807560	3810440	the random forest algorithm in order to,
3810440	3813960	in order to map input pose estimation frames,
3813960	3818000	a frame length of 200 to the predicted,
3818000	3820760	to the predicted alphabet from A to Z.
3820760	3823640	Next, we also use an LSTM model,
3823640	3825760	which captures sequential dependencies
3825760	3829560	to map from hand pose coordinates
3829560	3832640	to the actual word.
3832640	3836120	And then we also have our individualized RAG
3836120	3841120	calling in Lang chain as well as PDFs
3841880	3845000	PDFs that are specific to ASL learning
3845000	3847160	that get chunked and transformed
3847160	3849760	in a vector dimension space.
3849760	3851440	Now, as you can see here,
3851440	3856440	this is a hand pose estimation extraction
3856720	3858400	using the media pipe library.
3858400	3860440	So you can see A, B and C.
3862040	3864720	And here's our platform where you can,
3864720	3866480	there are different modules to learn
3866480	3868920	alphabets, signs, as well as sentences.
3868920	3873040	And we even have, we even have a real-time ASL practice.
3873040	3876680	So in real-time to capture the sign that you are actually,
3876680	3878260	the letter that you're actually signing
3878260	3880320	and give you the accuracy for that.
3880320	3883640	So here's an example of us using the media pipe library
3883640	3887560	to actually extract all of the hand key points.
3887560	3891400	And here are some videos where they're over hundreds
3891400	3893040	of words that you can actually view
3893040	3897000	to learn each of the hand signing frames.
3897040	3899720	Now, this is our proprietary RAG.
3899720	3904320	And the way we've trained this is we've collected,
3904320	3906200	we've collected a variety of PDFs
3906200	3910840	that are essentially manuals for ASL learning.
3910840	3912560	And potentially in the future,
3912560	3916760	we would want to incorporate things like YouTube transcriptions
3916760	3921200	that can actually be transformed and embedded
3921200	3924280	within our vector dimension model.
3925280	3928480	Now, in the future, this doesn't,
3928480	3932600	ASL doesn't just, hand pose estimation doesn't just have
3932600	3936520	to be localized to ASL.
3936520	3938400	There are plenty of other opportunities
3938400	3942320	for human pose estimation, including fields
3942320	3944040	like dance, martial arts,
3944040	3946520	where you can not only identify certain techniques,
3946520	3950720	but you can also get feedback generations
3950720	3953400	from certain input frames.
3953400	3955920	And in the future, this could also be integrated
3955920	3959640	into existing solutions, such as Zoom, Loom,
3959640	3961120	and FaceTime videos.
3961120	3966200	So if there's, so given the signing
3966200	3969360	of a certain sentence transcript,
3969360	3973320	you can get in real time the actual predicted sentences
3973320	3974160	and words.
3976240	3977080	Okay.
3977840	3978680	Thank you.
3978680	3979520	Thank you.
3979520	3980360	Thank you.
3988080	3990160	That's nice work for 36 hours.
3993920	3998920	I would be, I spent some time creating assistive
4000440	4001960	technologies for the blind,
4001960	4005720	and I would be just very aware of the market
4005760	4009400	and how you'll approach it and who will be paying.
4009400	4012400	I think that will be a good thing to pay attention to.
4012400	4013240	Thank you.
4016480	4019360	Yeah, as you think about the market,
4019360	4021240	I feel like these language learning apps
4021240	4026080	are tricky to kind of scale to meaningful businesses.
4026080	4027840	There was sort of like Rosetta Stone,
4027840	4028840	whatever, 20 years ago,
4028840	4030080	and then there's been like Duolingo
4030080	4031080	on this most recent gen,
4031080	4032600	but there aren't like that many
4032600	4034000	that get to meaningful scale.
4034040	4036920	So might be worth just thinking about that market
4036920	4039960	and what are the kind of success drivers?
4039960	4042160	I think even as I mentioned previously,
4042160	4044640	apart from just hand pose estimation,
4044640	4046120	I think that there's a big market
4046120	4047920	for body pose estimation.
4047920	4050720	I think especially in things like combat training,
4050720	4052800	especially like if you look at the military,
4052800	4055680	even dance performance companies
4055680	4057000	where they have to train dancers
4057000	4059600	and they're actually specific techniques
4059600	4063400	in which they'd want ground truth feedbacks for,
4063400	4065920	I think those are also potential markets
4065920	4068320	that could be ready to penetrate into.
4069440	4072280	You chose more traditional machine learning algorithms
4072280	4074800	in early neural nets like LSTM,
4074800	4078160	and that may be the right answer.
4078160	4079080	That's not obvious to me,
4079080	4081880	but I think for today's audience,
4081880	4083680	we need to explain why you're not using
4083680	4087680	more contemporary GNAI algorithms.
4087680	4090800	Yeah, so initially we were actually thinking about
4090800	4095440	using more encoder-based transformer models,
4095440	4098480	but we ran into some struggles,
4098480	4103480	so we just ended up settling on the LSTMs,
4103720	4108040	but in the future, we would obviously adapt
4108040	4111000	more of the state of the art transformers,
4111000	4114800	and even in the case for feedback generation
4114800	4116480	for given hand poses,
4116480	4119800	that could be an easy encoder-to-decoder
4119800	4123280	multi-self-attention model that you could train.
4126640	4127720	Okay, thank you so much.
4127720	4128560	Thank you.
4128560	4129400	Thank you.
4131680	4135920	All right, our last contestant for the grand prize
4135920	4136800	is Greenwise.
4136800	4138400	Please welcome Greenwise.
4138400	4139240	Thank you.
4145720	4150480	When I was 14, I stopped eating all meat.
4151960	4153760	I lasted about two months.
4156120	4158680	Now, even though I still eat meat,
4158680	4161080	there are a lot of small changes you can make
4161080	4164440	that have a huge impact on your carbon footprint.
4164440	4168160	For example, by switching from beef to chicken,
4168240	4172520	you cut the carbon footprint of your meals by six times.
4172520	4176080	What we do is we help you make that switch
4176080	4178120	from beef to chicken for everything,
4178120	4181800	for your shoes, your shirt, household supplies, food.
4181800	4183960	Everything has a carbon cost
4183960	4186240	and a carbon footprint that we can mitigate.
4187960	4191600	So how does a consumer analyze all their purchases
4191600	4193520	and the carbon footprint of anything
4193520	4196280	and try to make all these very difficult decisions
4196320	4200120	and research about how they should change their actions?
4200120	4202480	Well, this is where Greenwise comes in.
4202480	4207120	We seamlessly integrate with existing customer purchase models
4207120	4212120	to basically input what the consumer is already doing,
4212160	4214800	for example, through receipts or through emails,
4214800	4219200	and we integrate with Apple Pay, with Amazon,
4219200	4222240	and with Square to automatically get their purchases
4222240	4223800	into our system.
4223800	4227800	From there, we vectorize their purchase
4227800	4230040	and compare it to our vector database.
4230040	4232840	This database has all the carbon footprints
4232840	4237280	of over 10,000 products that we've analyzed
4237280	4239760	and made sure that these are accurate carbon estimates.
4239760	4242320	Additionally, by using the vector embedding,
4242320	4245920	we make sure that these similarity scores are very accurate.
4245920	4248400	It's not an LLM that can hallucinate.
4248400	4252960	These are real accuracy scores and real carbon predictions.
4252960	4254720	From there, it directly can tell them
4254720	4257600	an alternative product that is very similar
4257600	4260520	but has less carbon footprint.
4260520	4263400	Additionally, this provides a lot of room for scaling
4263400	4265200	when other businesses want to analyze
4265200	4267120	their carbon footprint for their products
4268160	4271040	or for events and other bigger venues.
4274400	4279400	So from good intentions to reality, let's make it happen.
4280320	4281560	Thank you.
4290080	4291760	It's a very innovative rag use case.
4291760	4293360	I never thought of that.
4293360	4295480	We're not using graph.
4295480	4296840	Oh, it's not.
4296840	4299720	It's similar in that it uses a vector embedding
4299720	4302360	for finding similarity,
4302360	4305400	but the similarity is directly the output.
4305400	4306280	Yes, that's right.
4306280	4309720	Yeah, yeah, that's all it is.
4309720	4312960	Is this a subscription product?
4312960	4313560	So currently?
4313560	4317320	Are you would imagine it being a subscription product?
4317320	4319760	We would imagine, or maybe you could talk about it.
4319760	4323200	Probably not.
4323200	4326560	Ideally, we'd integrate with existing businesses,
4326560	4334560	like Instacart or Safeway, so that they can show our results
4334560	4339680	on how the carbon footprint of certain products
4339680	4347200	is on their app, but it also works for consumers
4347200	4350480	to use on their own, as demonstrated here.
4353560	4355560	People wouldn't pay for a subscription, though.
4362000	4363280	OK, I think that's all the comments.
4363280	4364280	Thank you so much.
4365240	4369560	Green wise, thank you.
4369560	4372800	All right, I would now like to invite our esteemed judges
4372800	4377920	to convene in this secret room, where judges make their decisions.
4377920	4380800	And we are going to have the special prizes.
4380800	4382760	So as I mentioned, a bunch of sponsors
4382760	4384800	came to make this all happen.
4384800	4387320	We're an educational program, and it is entirely
4387320	4389040	the support of these sponsors.
4389040	4392440	And they're not just providing support, they got cool prizes.
4392480	4395600	So let's bring them on in just a minute.
4395600	4397040	You're going to hear from each one.
4397040	4399400	These are the sponsors for today.
4399400	4401920	And I also want to thank our community sponsors.
4401920	4404200	These are startups, very cool startups
4404200	4408000	who hung out and helped our young hackers with their needs
4408000	4409920	and their cool tools.
4409920	4413200	All right, so our very first special prize
4413200	4418000	is going to be announced by a very special campus partner.
4418000	4422000	I'd like to welcome the Academic Innovation
4422000	4422720	Catalyst.
4422720	4425840	I'd like to welcome out here Matt Sincini and Paul
4425840	4429720	Warp to tell you about AIC, one of our newest campus partners
4429720	4431040	doing very cool stuff.
4431040	4432320	Please give them a welcome.
4432320	4434520	Thank you.
4434520	4435920	Thank you so much, Caroline.
4435920	4437280	It's just a thrill to be here.
4437280	4442080	So my partner and I, Paul and I created Academic Innovation
4442080	4446240	Catalyst, or AIC, to release more innovation
4446240	4450240	from academic research for positive social impact.
4450240	4453720	And we're focused initially on the areas of climate tech
4453720	4456960	and AI for good, which is why we're here today.
4456960	4457880	How do we do this?
4457880	4460600	Well, we make proof of concept grants,
4460600	4464120	so no strings attached, non-dilutive grants
4464120	4466440	to academics with an idea.
4466440	4468760	Then we help them take that idea, carry it
4468760	4473880	through commercialization to scale and sustainability.
4473880	4475520	So that's what we do.
4475520	4477680	We're thrilled to be here today, and we'll
4477680	4482200	be making two awards to the most compelling business
4482200	4485800	plans or innovations involving the use of AI
4485800	4487680	to make the world a better place.
4487680	4490440	And we couldn't be more excited to announce them
4490440	4492480	in five seconds here.
4492480	4495680	I'll just say that we met with many amazing teams.
4495680	4497480	It's been an extraordinary weekend.
4497480	4499680	Thank you so much for including us.
4499680	4501360	We had to narrow it down to two.
4501360	4503080	It was tough, but I think you'll see
4503080	4504280	that they're well deserving.
4504280	4507440	So with that, let me hand it to my partner, Paul Warp,
4507440	4512800	to announce the winners of the AIC AI for Good Awards in 19,
4512800	4514200	I'm sorry, 2024.
4516840	4520240	This is what happens when you get old people up here on stage.
4520240	4523600	So anyway, we are really thrilled to be here, as Matt said,
4523600	4525800	and we're especially thrilled with the fact
4525800	4528440	that so many of you are putting your talents
4528440	4533040	to work for such great causes and for the betterment
4533040	4534320	of humanity.
4534320	4537280	And AI has so much potential in so many realms,
4537280	4541240	but among the most important is to make the world a better
4541240	4542880	place and to make a social impact.
4542880	4545080	And so with that, we're thrilled to announce
4545080	4550280	the first two winners, Dispatch AI and ASL Brigify.
4550280	4558120	So these are tremendous companies.
4558120	4561320	Again, the competition was so strong.
4561320	4564040	May I ask actually both sets of winners
4564040	4567640	to stand in the audience here?
4567640	4571760	And thank you again so much for the terrific work.
4571760	4574640	I think as you heard, ASL Brigify
4574640	4581040	is doing for sign language what Duolingo has done for learning
4581040	4581920	other languages.
4581920	4583000	And it is so important.
4583000	4586280	It's incredible and shocking that it's an underserved
4586280	4587920	and currently not served market.
4587920	4590680	And their technologies are going to change that.
4590680	4593440	And Dispatch AI, what can you say?
4593440	4596000	I mean, it's such an important issue
4596000	4598320	to be able to get emergency response,
4598320	4600520	to be able to get a response when you need it.
4600520	4603680	And of course, the reality is when we have, unfortunately,
4603680	4606200	too many mass catastrophes, the time
4606200	4609240	when you need the response strapped
4609240	4613120	is that you're often most short staffed.
4613120	4616840	And so Dispatch AI is using artificial intelligence
4616840	4621080	and a variety of technologies to speed that process up
4621080	4624880	and to help both the dispatchers and the people
4624880	4626240	that the dispatchers are helping.
4626240	4628960	And so can I ask the Dispatch AI team to stand up as well
4628960	4629920	and be recognized?
4629920	4634840	It's a great job.
4634840	4637520	Congratulations to all of you and to everyone
4637520	4638400	who is here today.
4638400	4640040	Thank you so much.
4640040	4641200	Thank you, Madam Paul.
4641200	4643440	Thank you, Academic Innovation Catalyst.
4643440	4645800	Our next special prize is going to be
4645800	4648960	introduced by our very own General Manager at Skydeck,
4648960	4650080	Sybil Chen.
4650080	4650880	Give her a welcome.
4650880	4651380	Woo!
4656380	4657080	Hello, everyone.
4657080	4661000	Hope everyone has had a great weekend.
4661000	4664520	At Skydeck, we have about a year and a half ago,
4664520	4667680	we launched the Skydeck Climate Tech track.
4667680	4671080	In part, thanks to a nice grant from the university,
4671080	4674400	we had $150,000 to build out the track.
4674400	4677480	And right away, we started putting that to work.
4677480	4682240	We grew our advisor network from maybe like five advisors
4682240	4685720	in the climate tech to now over 30 advisors that
4685720	4687520	are in the climate tech space.
4687520	4690240	And beyond that, prior to the grant,
4690240	4693840	we had maybe three or five startups, every batch that
4693840	4695200	were in climate tech.
4695200	4698560	And now we average 15 startups per batch
4698560	4700320	in the climate tech space.
4700320	4702800	And we really hope to see that grow.
4702800	4706800	So I'm very pleased to announce that the winner of the Skydeck
4706800	4710080	Climate Tech track is Team Greenwise.
4710080	4712120	I think they're still in the green room
4712120	4713240	because they just pitched.
4713240	4716240	They were the last ones to go on stage.
4716240	4720640	But they really kind of represent the team members
4720640	4723680	that we'd like to see at early stage startups.
4723680	4726480	It's three team members that are best friends
4726480	4727840	from middle school.
4727840	4728520	Yeah, they are.
4728520	4730000	Oh, they're out here on stage.
4730000	4731160	Come on out.
4731160	4732160	I wasn't expecting that.
4732160	4736960	But Anthony, Ben, and Ethan, three best friends
4736960	4740920	from middle school representing UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz,
4740920	4744200	and UC Santa Barbara.
4744200	4748600	And they've built a platform for carbon footprint tracking
4748600	4753520	with actionable recommendations for vendors
4753520	4757200	so that people and companies can reduce their overall carbon
4757200	4758040	footprint.
4758040	4760840	So please help me in congratulating this team.
4760880	4762880	Winners of $25,000.
4762880	4766880	All right.
4766880	4767680	Thank you, Simo.
4767680	4768720	Thank you, Greenwise.
4768720	4769760	Clicker, clicker.
4769760	4771040	Thank you.
4771040	4774840	All right, next up, special prizes from Intel.
4774840	4776800	Intel, come on out.
4776800	4777920	Intel was here.
4777920	4779720	Their table was swamped.
4779720	4783800	I'd like to introduce Gabrielle Amaronto.
4783800	4785040	Hi, everyone.

4793680	4795720	So thank you to everyone who joined our track.
4795720	4798280	As you can see, the winners behind me,
4798280	4800080	congrats to all the winners.
4800080	4802640	We have our Raffle winner, Ayla Arres.

4804680	4807200	Second place is Batteries by LLM.

4847200	4847880	Awesome.
4847880	4850320	Well, hey, thank you so much, Skydeck Team,
4850320	4852000	for having us and Calhacks.
4852000	4855480	This has been an extremely impressively run operation.
4855480	4858320	And we're really excited to be partners and sponsors
4858320	4859920	of this hackathon.
4859920	4861840	Today, we have three different prizes.
4861840	4863800	Actually, let me introduce myself first.
4863800	4866240	We have Brandon, Kevin, and Rohit.
4866240	4869680	We are members of the Generative AI Organization at AWS.
4869680	4872120	We work with top Generative AI startups
4872120	4875720	like Anthropics, Stability, Perplexity, and others

4878080	4883240	as well as our overall kind of inorganic and organic growth
4883240	4885880	strategy, including investments as well.
4885880	4888040	Today, we have three different prizes.
4888040	4891280	We have four of the teams that we have chosen
4891280	4893000	to give the prizes out to.
4893000	4897360	Our first place prize is for $10,000 in AWS credits.
4897400	4900120	And we have two other prizes, one for climate tech
4900120	4902840	and then one for responsible AI, which are $5,000.
4902840	4907760	I did want to say that we talked to so many impressive startups
4907760	4912000	and founding teams today and hackathon teams today.
4912000	4914280	I wish we could give prizes to all of them.
4914280	4917880	We did want to recommend that those who we spoke with,
4917880	4920400	and I think we have these conversations with you already,
4920400	4923040	to go ahead and apply for the AWS Generative AI
4923040	4926080	accelerator, as well as our AWS Activate

5107040	5110200	as they went, using sources from the web,
5110200	5112160	and you.com search APIs.
5112160	5114040	It was really incredible and powerful.

5130080	5137360	So we were particularly impressed by what they've built.
5137360	5139680	Essentially, they handled booking, searching,
5139680	5143160	and even talking with customer agents on the phone.
5143160	5147720	And they used you.com in a way to actually find these events.
