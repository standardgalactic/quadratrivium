00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
In this discussion, Donald Davidson talks philosophy with his teacher and long-standing friend, W. V. Quine.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
The discussion focuses on two broad areas of philosophy – empiricism, in which Quine is mainly interviewed by Davidson,

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
and truth, where Quine conducts the questioning.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
In these important discussions, major differences between these two highly influential philosophers are highlighted,

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
and the differences are brought to an apparent resolution.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
In response to Quine's opening question, Davidson clearly states his chief criticism of Quine's approach to philosophy.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
He charges that Quine, like all empiricists, is committed to an undesirable third dogma of empiricism.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
This is the view that all our empirical knowledge is based upon something non-propositional,

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
that is, given to us by the senses.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
As criticism is elaborated, we see the extent to which Quine's views about the source of empirical knowledge have changed

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
– from his famous paper Two Dogmas of Empiricism through Word and Object, and up to his most recent writings.

01:38.000 --> 01:46.000
Quine suggests that he no longer holds a third dogma of empiricism, but he maintains, nonetheless, that he is still an empiricist.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
The discussion ends with a dispute about what it is to be an empiricist,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
and Davidson's exclamation, and I quote,

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
we're in agreement, completely. It only took 50 years.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
In the second part of the program, Quine questions Davidson on his views about truth.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Both philosophers agree that truth is always relative to a language,

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
but Quine holds that it is also relative to a chosen manual of translation.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
This leads to a lively discussion encompassing both the connections between truth and translation

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
and the importance of a Tarski-style definition of truth.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
The program ends with questions from the invited audience, from David Papineau of King's College London,

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
from the philosopher and broadcaster Brian McGee, and from Colin Hausen of the London School of Economics.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
We join the discussion now at the London School of Economics.

02:40.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm delighted to introduce my next discussant on the work of Donald Davidson.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
I can't say he's an old friend of mine, which I'm sure Donald can say with his hand on his heart,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
but I've had the pleasure of knowing and working with him.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
Now it's over a period of a few years since the project that we worked.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
On together, in conversation, Willard Van Orman, Quine, as it was,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
and I'm absolutely delighted that he's come here today.

03:18.000 --> 03:28.000
He's made a special trip from his planned itinerary to come here for his great close friend and pupil, Donald Davidson.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
So without dragging any of this off since the time is valuable, and I'm sure you want to hear our honored guest,

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
I'd like to give you Professor Quine, emeritus professor at Harvard University, and our guest today.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
It's a privilege and I want to get out of the way and let him get close to his friend.

03:48.000 --> 03:58.000
If you sit here, be careful on the wires.

03:58.000 --> 04:08.000
Well, along the middle of the century, I came out against what I called two dogmas of empiricism.

04:08.000 --> 04:22.000
One was the dichotomy, the basic dichotomy, professively, of truths into the analytic,

04:22.000 --> 04:31.000
or ones that depended only on the meanings of the words, and the synthetic ones, which had some factual content.

04:31.000 --> 04:42.000
And the other dogma was the dogma of reductionism in the sense of there being a separable empirical content

04:42.000 --> 04:55.000
to any meaningful synthetic statement, which could be isolated independently of surrounding statements.

04:55.000 --> 05:10.000
And then more recently, Don, you came out against an alleged third dogma, and it's not altogether clear to me what that is.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Good, I'll do my best.

05:15.000 --> 05:39.000
I think I heard about the first two dogmas in about 1940, and I've never deviated from the straight path with respect to them.

05:39.000 --> 06:00.000
The third one, I learned, or thought I learned when I was a graduate student, to be against not only reductionism,

06:00.000 --> 06:16.000
but the idea that all of our empirical knowledge, anyway, is based on something which is not itself propositional in character,

06:16.000 --> 06:32.000
something that's given by the senses of, call it what you will, experience, percepts, impressions, sense data,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
they're all these different things.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
The search for something of this kind is easy to understand.

06:41.000 --> 06:50.000
If we just start out with beliefs, we wonder how they're attached or get attached to the world.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
So we want something that lies behind them that will justify them.

06:56.000 --> 07:11.000
Nevertheless, I became convinced then, I guess partly anyway, by Sellar's article on the myth of the given,

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
that there was nothing we could find that satisfied these two conditions.

07:17.000 --> 07:25.000
On the one hand, it would justify our empirical beliefs, and on the other hand, it wouldn't be propositional in character.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
Because if it wasn't propositional in character, then it couldn't stand in a relation of justification.

07:33.000 --> 07:47.000
So I remember reading some of the logical positivists that seemed to me to be having trouble with this very issue.

07:47.000 --> 07:55.000
One of my teachers was C.I. Lewis, and he certainly had something like sense data.

07:55.000 --> 08:03.000
So there was the school of sense data and the like on the one hand, and those who were against it,

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
and had to try to come up with something different.

08:09.000 --> 08:22.000
The third dogma of empiricism I've just described, that is, it's the idea that somehow in experience,

08:22.000 --> 08:33.000
we are given something which is not propositional, but which nevertheless justifies our empirical beliefs.

08:34.000 --> 08:44.000
Now, U-van were very cagey about this.

08:44.000 --> 08:58.000
You gave up on sense data and any of these other things, and had an alternative approach,

08:58.000 --> 09:08.000
which in the end I decided nevertheless had the seeds of the same mistake or confusion.

09:08.000 --> 09:19.000
Now, it's perhaps not too long a story to say how it seemed to me this was still there.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
Of course, there were phrases in, well, let's start with two dogmas.

09:26.000 --> 09:36.000
In two dogmas, there was the totality of our beliefs on the one hand, and on the other hand,

09:36.000 --> 09:45.000
there was experience pressing in from the outside, and the relationship was holistic

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
and you couldn't track down the empirical content, especially to more theoretical senses,

09:51.000 --> 10:00.000
to any particular place on the periphery as it was then metaphorically described.

10:00.000 --> 10:10.000
But nevertheless, there was the tribunal of experience, and I remember way back then,

10:10.000 --> 10:18.000
you may not remember this, but I actually read the manuscript of two dogmas in 1950

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
before you gave it when you came to the south of France and stayed with me and my then wife.

10:25.000 --> 10:34.000
During that summer you had it with you, I read it, and I worried about that tribunal of experience.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
And does it speak up?

10:38.000 --> 10:47.000
If it speaks up, then it's got propositional content, but no, propositions started one stage further in.

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
So the question is, well, what exactly is the relationship between the tribunal of experience

10:54.000 --> 11:01.000
and observation senses which lie right there on the periphery?

11:01.000 --> 11:13.000
Now, all of that was a metaphor, and in fact it only came in at the very end as a kind of way of summing up an attitude

11:13.000 --> 11:22.000
rather than a doctrine, and we're in an object, this got cashed out to a certain extent,

11:22.000 --> 11:35.000
although we still were often regaled with phrases like the totality of our data come from the stimulations of our senses,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
all of the evidence that we have.

11:39.000 --> 11:48.000
And I remember stewing really for years about what exactly is the evidence in this theory.

11:48.000 --> 11:57.000
But it isn't the actual firings of the nerve endings, that's not the evidence.

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
If we start with observation sentences and say they are the evidence, not that they express the evidence,

12:04.000 --> 12:12.000
but that they are the evidence, that doesn't seem to be the right category for something to be evidence.

12:12.000 --> 12:23.000
And I remember writing at some point there, as far as I can see, Quine doesn't have anything that really should be called the ultimate evidence.

12:23.000 --> 12:30.000
He has no theory of evidence, and he agreed with this. I hope you still do.

12:30.000 --> 12:52.000
Yes, I certainly don't speak of experience anymore, if I'm on my guard.

12:52.000 --> 13:05.000
I think my attitude here is closer to Popper in the sense of stressing refutation rather than evidence and support.

13:05.000 --> 13:24.000
And the refutation comes in predicting something which is a describable observation sentence,

13:24.000 --> 13:33.000
which is a sentence that would be agreed to by all observers who are familiar with the language.

13:33.000 --> 13:41.000
These are the ultimate checkpoints, as I see it.

13:41.000 --> 13:55.000
And that's where the empirical content comes into our theory of nature.

13:55.000 --> 14:09.000
The term evidence itself plays an essential role, I don't think it's a supporting member of the structure anymore, for me.

14:10.000 --> 14:20.000
If it ever was, really, it certainly would seem so in that last page of Two Dogmas.

14:21.000 --> 14:40.000
But certainly, simply from a naturalistic point of view, we need to find out what the mechanism is of finding out about the world,

14:41.000 --> 14:54.000
this is simply a causal matter, which involves the neural receptors, the internal neural hookup.

14:55.000 --> 15:10.000
But as far as there is an empirical content, it operates at these checkpoints, which are just here and there.

15:11.000 --> 15:18.000
That's what keeps our theory honest.

15:18.000 --> 15:31.000
What to call evidence in the sense of what we observe first and then leads us to make a conjecture

15:31.000 --> 15:46.000
is less easy to say. We are guided partly by observations, partly by canons of simplicity, symmetry, the sort of thing that makes a theory appeal to us.

15:46.000 --> 15:58.000
And to what extent that is dependable, well, I think there's still some unsolved problems there.

15:58.000 --> 16:10.000
I'm wondering, in view of all this, whether I still hold the third dogma or not.

16:10.000 --> 16:24.000
Well, I think it's a good question, because one of the ways in which I thought I could show that you did,

16:24.000 --> 16:34.000
you've given up, I think, and that has to do with how do we determine the content of observation sentences.

16:34.000 --> 16:44.000
And at one time, it was determined by patterns of stimulation at the skin or wherever.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
And there's more to the story, which I can tell if necessary.

16:50.000 --> 17:02.000
You've partly given that up, that is, the patterns of stimulation, the actual patterns have only a very remote connection with the actual contents,

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
which are geared to distal objects and so forth.

17:07.000 --> 17:16.000
Now, that in itself is to give up, in that area, anyway, of what I call the dogma of empiricism.

17:16.000 --> 17:30.000
Well, in what sense I give that up, I would say it is, in this sense, recognizing, which was a problem back when we were in an object,

17:30.000 --> 17:49.000
recognizing that there need be, and probably is, no substantial homology between one individual's receptors and that neural hookup and another's.

17:49.000 --> 17:59.000
And in fact, it's in one of the earliest pages of Darwin's Origin of Species that he says regarding insects.

17:59.000 --> 18:16.000
He says even these simple creatures have decidedly, unlike neural patterns, neural hookups, one from another.

18:16.000 --> 18:45.000
And yes, we do somehow agree on, in our responses, we learn to agree on our responses to distal objects as if those distal objects were flashed on us with pretty much identical projections, which they're presumably not.

18:46.000 --> 19:03.000
Well, and in word and object, faced with this problem, I assumed the homology, but I was uncomfortable with it.

19:03.000 --> 19:16.000
And then finally, in fact, on your urging, I gave it up, but it left that question then hanging, hanging fire.

19:16.000 --> 19:28.000
And it wasn't until some years later that I began to see my way through that, namely in terms of a pre-established harmony to borrow Leibniz's phrase,

19:28.000 --> 19:38.000
but to a pre-established harmony which, unlike Leibniz's, was explicable causally without divine intervention.

19:39.000 --> 20:03.000
And, namely through natural selection and adaptation of our standards of similarity with the environment, quite independently of whether there's a neural matching to any appreciable degree between one individual's intake and another.

20:04.000 --> 20:25.000
So, well, perhaps that is the conclusion that the third dogma, that I don't hold that dogma myself.

20:26.000 --> 20:36.000
Well, you've said that now that the third dogma's gone, really empiricism itself is gone, and I certainly haven't viewed it that way.

20:36.000 --> 20:49.000
I continue to view myself as an empiricist, but where I have this lingering empiricism, which I think is vital, is with respect to these checkpoints,

20:49.000 --> 21:05.000
that we don't have an out-and-out coherence of epistemology, a way of knowing.

21:06.000 --> 21:19.000
But our procedure is tied to nature, just in that now and then we can derive something from our theory, which we can check to our satisfaction.

21:19.000 --> 21:42.000
At least we can be fairly sure that it's wrong that the cluster of hypotheses which together have implied this experimental setup is wrong, has some false hypotheses in it.

21:43.000 --> 21:58.000
And if we don't find that conflict, then things are all right up to the next inquiry, the next test.

21:59.000 --> 22:06.000
I'm not persuaded even that the negative result is conclusive.

22:06.000 --> 22:21.000
That's a point where I certainly have eased up, but that the conclusiveness of the observation senses themselves grades off.

22:21.000 --> 22:32.000
And it's a matter of the degree to which theory has infused into these sentences.

22:32.000 --> 22:59.000
But there is simply observably a tendency to firm agreement among observers on certain reports and not of this, an immediate agreement among those who command the language.

23:03.000 --> 23:10.000
Well, I would say this was a lingering trace of empiricism.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
Well, I don't disagree with any of that.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
So if that's empiricism, I'm an empiricist too.

23:19.000 --> 23:37.000
I was counting somebody as an empiricist only if, in effect, they thought there was some epistemically significant intermediary between the world and beliefs about it.

23:37.000 --> 23:48.000
And let's just take observation sentences of however exactly we pick them out in a graded classification anyway.

23:48.000 --> 23:57.000
But is there something that happens in between that is what we really use as evidence for what's beyond?

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
Something that's somehow given by the senses, all right.

24:01.000 --> 24:08.000
That's what I was calling the dogma of empiricism, the third dogma.

24:08.000 --> 24:15.000
And I thought you were originally stuck with something that was like that.

24:15.000 --> 24:29.000
When you were counting the contents of observation sentences as being given by, that is defined by, the patterns of stimulation that caused them.

24:29.000 --> 24:35.000
And therefore something personal, not public at all, but something personal.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
So that's my idea of old-fashioned empiricism.

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
And I remember once a long ago quizzing you about this and saying,

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
but isn't your notion of stimulus meaning just doing the same sort of work that sense data did before?

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
And you said, yes, that's the whole idea.

24:56.000 --> 25:08.000
Let's find something that's scientifically respectable, namely sense organs being stimulated in place of sense data.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
But you wanted them to do the same work.

25:11.000 --> 25:24.000
That is to serve as somehow allowing us to introduce something that would count as data evidence or something of that sort for our beliefs.

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
Now you've removed that, or let's say you've moved it to the outside world.

25:31.000 --> 25:41.000
And now it seems to me it's not like old-fashioned empiricism anymore, it's naturalism.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
And that seems to me fine.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Good.

25:46.000 --> 25:53.000
In word and object, already in my discussion of translation, for instance,

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
and even in my concept of observation sentences, it was always distal.

25:58.000 --> 26:06.000
It was always about the external world, the observation sentences themselves, it's raining, it's mama and so on.

26:07.000 --> 26:14.000
But there was the problem of the meaning of minds,

26:14.000 --> 26:26.000
and at that point in word and object, this lame device for accommodating it,

26:26.000 --> 26:36.000
namely assuming that there must be in a central respects physiological homology between the receptors of one person and those of another.

26:36.000 --> 26:50.000
And giving that up, first just giving it up and wondering, alright, how do we count for agreement.

26:50.000 --> 27:06.000
And then seeing finally how we do, in terms of ultimately of natural selection,

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
that runs out that picture.

27:11.000 --> 27:21.000
But I think a good part of this transition was in the 50s between word and object, 1950,

27:21.000 --> 27:30.000
and I mean two dogmas, 1950, and word and object, 1960.

27:30.000 --> 27:41.000
I found much of roots of reference was rather going back and forth between using stimulus meanings still as an important complex,

27:41.000 --> 27:50.000
and really just explaining the contents of observation sentences in terms of distal stimuli.

27:50.000 --> 27:57.000
And some passages did it one way and some did it another way.

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
And I always tried to encourage the distal one.

28:03.000 --> 28:18.000
I even found it, in roots of reference, a page where I come very close to what I now view as the solution.

28:18.000 --> 28:32.000
Namely the harmony of subjective standards of perceptual similarity between individuals,

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
an intersubjective harmony of the subjective standards.

28:36.000 --> 28:43.000
And finally that gets explained by natural selection.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
The environment being the shared thing rather than the receptors.

28:47.000 --> 28:54.000
The environment, that is to say, shared by our ancestors.

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
Far enough back so that natural selection could do its work.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
Well, all that seems to be exactly right.

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
And indeed, that was the right way to go for a long time.

29:13.000 --> 29:21.000
Just the thing that needs emphasis from my point of view, anyway,

29:21.000 --> 29:38.000
is we don't have any way of pulling together the various things that go into the old idea of stimulus meaning.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
We don't have any way of pulling that together except by talking about the distal objects.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
I mean, that's where the convergence comes as you're now saying.

29:47.000 --> 30:01.000
So it's not as though there's some way in which as philosophers we can study how it is that the different patterns of stimulation,

30:01.000 --> 30:13.000
nevertheless, the particular class of stimulation that do prompt us to give similar responses as table, glass, picture, and so forth.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
We just say, well, that's how it came out.

30:17.000 --> 30:27.000
And much of that, of course, can be partially explained or maybe a great deal can be explained by people who know much more neurology

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
and wiring of the brain and that sort of thing than we do.

30:33.000 --> 30:40.000
But our explanation of what patterns go together, so to speak, to produce the same response,

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
we just say, well, what brings them together is the sameness of the response.

30:45.000 --> 30:52.000
Not only the sameness of my responses because I respond to the very different patterns in somewhat the same way.

30:52.000 --> 30:58.000
Never mind what the lighting is, never mind the perspective, never mind the distance.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
People get a person's response under all these different conditions.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
But furthermore, you do the same thing.

31:08.000 --> 31:18.000
And all of this has a natural explanation, but it doesn't seem to me to be empiricism anymore

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
in one of its most characteristic phases.

31:22.000 --> 31:31.000
Namely, somehow there's a subjective or personal thing from which I build up the whole picture of the world.

31:31.000 --> 31:39.000
Here the picture of the world is being built up on the basis of something that we share with each other.

31:39.000 --> 31:55.000
Yes, the divergence from an overwhelming empiricism perhaps is that within the scope of the checkpoints,

31:55.000 --> 32:07.000
there can be such a tremendous variation in all the superstructure, all the theory, all the natural science

32:07.000 --> 32:15.000
that systematizes and brings together our observations.

32:15.000 --> 32:31.000
And this in fact is the sort of thing that made me make the conjecture anyway of the indeterminacy of translation of theoretical sentences.

32:32.000 --> 32:46.000
Then there's this recent short article of yours in the Journal of Philosophy in which you announce the discovery of the distal object.

32:46.000 --> 32:52.000
And you say, all right, now this goes for understanding another person.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
That is for our theory of meaning, so to speak.

32:55.000 --> 33:07.000
But you say, with respect to epistemology, I'm still for working with the proximal stimulus.

33:07.000 --> 33:18.000
And now I wonder what you meant by that at this point because you've always insisted and it seems to me absolutely rightly

33:18.000 --> 33:24.000
that theory of meaning and epistemology have to go hand in hand.

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
It's a major theme of roots of reference but still popped up again and again and again.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
Now it looks as if they're going in two different directions.

33:32.000 --> 33:47.000
And I wonder if that, I mean you said so little about it that I'd like to get that straight or let me say I'll urge you to bring the two back together again.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
Yes, now what did I have in mind there?

33:51.000 --> 34:05.000
The causal account of learning and of projecting a theory.

34:05.000 --> 34:18.000
And this I viewed as a naturalization of epistemology.

34:18.000 --> 34:24.000
And I think of myself then as a naturalized empiricist.

34:25.000 --> 34:38.000
And so I think of the causal account as a central part of naturalized epistemology.

34:38.000 --> 34:47.000
Well certainly the senses play a causal role in our learning and knowing anything about the outside world.

34:47.000 --> 34:52.000
But do they play an epistemic part?

34:52.000 --> 35:04.000
That is can we say at some particular stage in this causal process which begins with the world and ends up with beliefs.

35:04.000 --> 35:21.000
Is there some intermediate stage where we can say something about, here's an epistemological event or a layer that's in between out there and out belief.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
I don't see where it would be, you know.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
Now we can stop because we're in agreement completely.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
It only took 50 years.

35:38.000 --> 35:57.000
Yes, another point I'd like to clear it up is in what sense your view of truth is transcendent rather than imminent?

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
Well these aren't my words, transcendent.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
Heaven's not. The word never crossed my lips.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
Oh for heaven's sake.

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
But no, it's imminent.

36:15.000 --> 36:26.000
Of course if we're talking about language, truth is relative to language.

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
Or even relative to the individual's language.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
That's the imminent.

36:36.000 --> 36:47.000
But not, I would say in any sense that I understand, relative to something like a conceptual scheme.

36:47.000 --> 36:55.000
Given what our sentences mean on occasion, they're just true or false.

36:55.000 --> 37:03.000
Or anyway, they have fixed truth conditions and is that transcendent?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
It's non-relative.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
The truth of our beliefs is non-relative.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
I mean they just are true or not.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
At least they have truth conditions.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
I mean I don't want to insist that they're always either true or false.

37:17.000 --> 37:22.000
Maybe some of them are neither but that's just a side issue.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
But they're truth conditions.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
We know what it would be for our beliefs to be true.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
And if they are true, they're simply true.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
There's nothing relative about that.

37:35.000 --> 37:43.000
You regard the content of the notion of truth as given completely by disquotation?

37:43.000 --> 37:53.000
In one sense, well, there's a lot that that doesn't give us.

37:53.000 --> 38:03.000
Disquotation only works where the language we're referring to is the same language that we're using.

38:03.000 --> 38:10.000
And in many, many cases anyway, we can't take that for granted.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
I mean if I'm talking about the truth as something you said,

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
disquotation can't be taken for granted.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Maybe you meant the same thing that I mean.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
So I can say, well, that sentence of yours is true if and only if.

38:23.000 --> 38:29.000
But talking about your language, I'm using mine.

38:29.000 --> 38:35.000
And it's an empirical assumption that your sentence meant the same thing as mine does.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Quite so.

38:36.000 --> 38:47.000
And so I think of the truth of a foreign sentence as dependent on a parameter,

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
which is the chosen manual of translation.

38:51.000 --> 39:00.000
And given the conjecture of indeterminacy of translation,

39:01.000 --> 39:09.000
that choice becomes an essential parameter.

39:09.000 --> 39:19.000
So yes, well, that relativity of translation certainly is clear.

39:19.000 --> 39:38.000
There's another respect which gives truth the feeling of transcendence certainly.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
And I've wondered whether this is the whole thing.

39:43.000 --> 39:55.000
Namely, when science takes a turn and something that had been accepted by the scientists

39:55.000 --> 40:00.000
is rejected in view of some unexpected observations in regard,

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
it comes to be rated as false.

40:04.000 --> 40:11.000
We don't say that even we naturalists who think of science as the last arbiter insofar

40:11.000 --> 40:22.000
as there is one don't say that it used to be true but turned out to be false.

40:22.000 --> 40:29.000
We say rather that we used to think it was true, but it was always false.

40:29.000 --> 40:35.000
And that, again, is subject to what happens next time around.

40:35.000 --> 40:44.000
Now here is a respect in which truth does go, even truth within the language,

40:44.000 --> 40:57.000
go beyond mere disquotation and a respect in which it might be regarded as transcendent

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
rather than imminent than if one continues to speak in those terms.

41:02.000 --> 41:10.000
But on the other hand, since I can see it only as a peculiarity of the idiom,

41:10.000 --> 41:21.000
it seems a little shallow compared to what we are apt to think of as truth uncritically.

41:22.000 --> 41:32.000
Let me pick up on the idea of truth relative to a translation manual.

41:32.000 --> 41:40.000
Does that mean that when we are talking about the truth of something somebody else says,

41:40.000 --> 41:47.000
that it's relative to two things, to the language and to the translation manual,

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
or just one thing?

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
I mean, my view would be there's just one thing.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
And what's that one thing?

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
The one thing is the language.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
I mean, we can name it as we please.

42:00.000 --> 42:07.000
I think what we want to understand is a person, and there isn't a thing called a language in addition.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
We have a way of interpreting.

42:10.000 --> 42:16.000
If we have one way, we've got other ways that we could have used.

42:17.000 --> 42:25.000
Whether we count a given utterance as having these truth conditions or those depends upon

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
what language we interpret them as speaking.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
And that's it.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I mean, that's a relativity.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Okay.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
But there isn't the second one now.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
And we always knew that truth was relative to a language.

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
So that we take for granted.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
So I don't think there are two different things that's relative to just one.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
Well, yes, this is the way I view it.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
Also, what would these two be?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
On the one hand, there's this quotation.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
That's for the language itself.

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
And then if you're going to speak of a sentence in another language as true,

43:15.000 --> 43:22.000
that's going to be relative to your translation of that language or that,

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
ultimately, that individual's,

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
into your own.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
There's that one.

43:36.000 --> 43:44.000
So the two things that it's relative to as I've been breaking it down is one,

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
one's own language via this quotation.

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
Second, the manual of translation in the case of it being in another language.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Good, good.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
I think that's exactly right.

43:59.000 --> 44:05.000
Disquotation, though, isn't really doing all that much work because it's from my own Italy.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I like it right now.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
And that's the best it can do.

44:11.000 --> 44:17.000
So, but here I have this notion of truth, which I certainly am applying to somebody else.

44:17.000 --> 44:24.000
In fact, I can't really make anything out of what they're talking about if I can't decide one way or another

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
what the truth conditions of their utterances are.

44:27.000 --> 44:38.000
So that has to be a notion of truth that transcends of what disquotation is giving.

44:38.000 --> 44:49.000
It's disquotation, if you want to think of it this way, plus interpretation.

44:49.000 --> 44:55.000
I mean, we don't have two different notions of truth.

44:55.000 --> 45:07.000
Well, so we're saying of this foreigner who's uttered something.

45:07.000 --> 45:15.000
We quote that in his, put quotation marks around just a transcription direct in his language.

45:15.000 --> 45:26.000
And we're saying that's true, if and only if, and then comes his sentence again.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
But then we have the further question, so what?

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
What does that mean?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Then we translate.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
There are those two steps.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Well, yes.

45:37.000 --> 45:43.000
You can, another way of thinking of it, which seems to be equivalent in many ways anyway,

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
but I want to understand this person.

45:47.000 --> 45:55.000
I say, well, here's my theory, or here's what I assume I know.

45:55.000 --> 46:03.000
If he utters that sentence, then it's true if and only if so and so.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
And that's what I believe.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
I'm not translating.

46:07.000 --> 46:15.000
If I write down that piece of wisdom, of course, it's going to concern two idealex, mine and his.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
But my knowledge is just what the truth conditions or my view is.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
What the truth conditions of what he said are these.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
That's the content of my belief or my knowledge.

46:29.000 --> 46:41.000
And I agree with you, if there's one total interpretive scheme that works, there'll be lots of others.

46:41.000 --> 46:50.000
And they may differ to the extent of actually counting certain of his utterances true on one of the accounts that falls on another,

46:50.000 --> 46:57.000
where I would have made up the slack with other sentences and his beliefs and so forth.

46:58.000 --> 47:04.000
Yes, the parameter has to be strictly speaking has to be the idealex at the moment.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Right.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
But let's see.

47:13.000 --> 47:22.000
I'll try to find a difference here between us because so far I think we're in agreement.

47:22.000 --> 47:30.000
If you think of a theory about what somebody else means as taking a fairly comprehensive form,

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
I mean, I'm not just have a theory about what one utterance means,

47:34.000 --> 47:39.000
but about what a lot of other utterances do mean or would mean.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
I put this in terms of sentences.

47:42.000 --> 47:48.000
If he were to utter such and such a sentence, it would have these truth conditions.

47:48.000 --> 47:55.000
I can specify all of this only by using something like a Tarski scheme.

47:55.000 --> 48:01.000
I mean, if I want to cover all his senses and say what the truth conditions for all of them are,

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
I need some way of organizing all that.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
And Tarski has shown us how to organize that.

48:08.000 --> 48:19.000
Yes, what is Tarski's contribution here?

48:19.000 --> 48:24.000
Of course, he brings out this point of this quotation to begin with,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
that there's a contribution in itself,

48:26.000 --> 48:36.000
although involving nothing in the way of the logical mathematical finesse that comes into his truth definition.

48:36.000 --> 48:42.000
But what does that add?

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
Only the, well, two things I'd say.

48:46.000 --> 48:58.000
For one thing, it makes for a finite definition of the class of true sentences

48:58.000 --> 49:05.000
rather than this, simply this plan, this formula of this quotation,

49:05.000 --> 49:11.000
which you can apply anywhere.

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
Also, of course, it has the virtue of, since it does give a straightforward definition,

49:16.000 --> 49:23.000
the virtue of avoiding the paradoxes, the paradox of the liar

49:23.000 --> 49:31.000
and bringing out the hierarchical structure of truth.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
Well, I see two other virtues.

49:35.000 --> 49:45.000
One of them is, it brings out a feature of language which isn't brought out by this quotation,

49:45.000 --> 49:53.000
that is, how it is that you could understand a potential infinity of sentences

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
given just a finite amount of information.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
And this quotation gives you no clue to that.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
And at the same time, of course, it brings out the relations

50:04.000 --> 50:09.000
between the truth and conditions of different sentences.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
Seeing that this sentence is true under these conditions,

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
under these conditions, you can then see, well, then, if this sentence is true,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
this one has to be true.

50:18.000 --> 50:29.000
So those relations are organized, let's say, made explicit by a truth definition of Tarski's sword,

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
whereas this quotation does none of that to you.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
May I add one more thing?

50:37.000 --> 50:45.000
If, unlike Tarski, we think of one of his definitions as attempting to be a definition

50:45.000 --> 50:51.000
for some actual language, I mean, for what somebody is doing, right?

50:51.000 --> 50:57.000
I mean, he's not worried about that, but I'm going to worry about it.

50:57.000 --> 51:03.000
I'm thinking of trying to organize what I know about somebody else's speech

51:04.000 --> 51:10.000
giving a Tarski-type definition or, let's say, just a theory of about the last step of life.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
But now it's an empirical theory, right?

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
If he says so-and-so, it's going to be true if and only if so-and-so.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
That itself is true or false.

51:19.000 --> 51:26.000
Now, according to Tarski, the totality of the T sentences is the test

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
of the correctness of a truth definition.

51:30.000 --> 51:38.000
Let me now say the test of my-the correctness of my theory about what somebody else means

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
is whether my T sentences are right.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
But how can I tell whether they're right?

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
Well, you've made a lot of wonderful suggestions.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
I'll take the observation sentences.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
I can tell whether I've got them right up to a point

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
by seeing under what circumstances he's inclined to assent to

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
or dissent from these sentences and so forth.

52:02.000 --> 52:08.000
And we have a way with the logical constants

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
and then there's some hand-waving of a good sort

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
when it comes to the theoretical ones.

52:16.000 --> 52:24.000
Now, that's how I test my empirical theory about somebody else.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Whether I've got it right.

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
Now, it seems to me all of that, since what I'm testing is a theory of truth

52:32.000 --> 52:39.000
or for them, all of this is relevant to what I mean by the word true.

52:39.000 --> 52:44.000
It's this kind of information which can be tested in this way.

52:44.000 --> 52:50.000
It's how I apply the concept of truth to people.

52:51.000 --> 53:01.000
Yes, it gives you the whole grammatical structure of the language

53:01.000 --> 53:10.000
and it pairs off the basic lexicon

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
insofar as we can think of a language as having a limited basic lexicon.

53:16.000 --> 53:27.000
And if we put it that way, it goes forward without even the predicate true.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
That's what's coming out of Tarski's actual constructions.

53:34.000 --> 53:44.000
He's got the primitive, he's got the simple predicates

53:44.000 --> 53:51.000
and he's got the modes of combination into a longer context.

53:51.000 --> 53:58.000
We can get rid of the true word true for any particular language.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
But we can't get rid of it in general.

54:02.000 --> 54:10.000
And we want what we do for different people to be the same sort of thing.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
We don't want to say, here's this, we can eliminate for each language

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
but I don't know if there's anything in common between these.

54:25.000 --> 54:32.000
Does this say more than that we can carry out parallel analyses

54:32.000 --> 54:42.000
in terms of recursion over grammatical structures

54:42.000 --> 54:48.000
of one language and another, any languages relative to our own?

54:49.000 --> 54:54.000
We find out how to translate this and that mode of combination.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
And we're just translating.

54:59.000 --> 55:08.000
But our standard then of whether each of these steps is right

55:08.000 --> 55:16.000
will depend on truth in the sense that it's depending on

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
whether we would affirm the one sentence when we affirm the other.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Well, it seems to me we're doing something.

55:26.000 --> 55:31.000
You say just translating but not any old way.

55:31.000 --> 55:37.000
We're doing it by connecting their utterances with things we observe in the world.

55:37.000 --> 55:44.000
And it's what you're doing in your radical interpretation.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
Sure, but we don't do it any old way.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
We do it so as to get truth conditions.

55:55.000 --> 56:01.000
What I can see there that makes a difference is that yes, we're doing it extensionally

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
rather than assisting with these sentences each step,

56:05.000 --> 56:10.000
not only being both true or both false,

56:10.000 --> 56:16.000
but necessarily so.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
And of course, I'm all for that.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
We're bypassing the modalities.

56:28.000 --> 56:38.000
Right, I'm just trying to put the case for the idea

56:38.000 --> 56:46.000
that we understand the concept of truth independent of disquotation.

56:49.000 --> 56:56.000
And that comes out, it seems to me, in what it is we think we're doing

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
or are trying to do when we translate.

57:00.000 --> 57:05.000
Put it in the context of the way you're thinking of it.

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
Why do we translate one way rather than another?

57:10.000 --> 57:16.000
We want to translate their sense,

57:16.000 --> 57:21.000
has these truth conditions with one of our own that has these truth conditions,

57:21.000 --> 57:27.000
give or take the kind of slack that indeterminacy introduces.

57:27.000 --> 57:34.000
The question is, do we have a lot of different concepts which come under the word true

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
or do we have one of which we're applying in many cases?

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
It seems to me quite clear that Tarski thought there's just one.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
Yes, I would.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
That's transcendence for you.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
Okay, then I'll ask some of these questions.

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
In this instance, first one's up, David followed by Brian.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I'm David Papada.

58:05.000 --> 58:12.000
I want to go back to the happy agreement to reject a certain conception of empiricism.

58:12.000 --> 58:17.000
And I don't think any of us want to resuscitate the sense-state

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
or the myth of the given or anything like that,

58:20.000 --> 58:26.000
but it was a bit uneasy about the way you characterised what you both agreed you wanted to reject.

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
Because it seemed to me you were in danger of denying something that was true.

58:31.000 --> 58:37.000
You characterised what you wanted to reject as an intermediary between belief and the outside world

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
that might play some kind of epistemological role.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
But it seemed to be clear that there are such things, despite what you said,

58:44.000 --> 58:51.000
not cessated perhaps, but think of the case with somebody knowing the experiences and illusions.

58:51.000 --> 58:57.000
But he looks at the Mullahi lines, and the arrows are pointing outwards and inwards.

58:57.000 --> 59:02.000
And there's two lines at the same length, and you look at them and you judge that they're different lengths.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
In a sense, you percentually judge the different lengths,

59:04.000 --> 59:09.000
even though you know because you've seen the trick a number of times before, that they're the same length.

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
So there seems to be a case that there is something in between my belief that they're the same length,

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
namely my perceptual judgment, that they're different lengths.

59:18.000 --> 59:25.000
And perhaps that perceptual judgment played a justificatory role, not in the physical one,

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
because in this kind of case, of course, we override it, but in the normal case,

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
we do form beliefs, it seems, on the basis of just such perceptual judgments.

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
So I wanted to know what, either or both of you would say about that,

59:38.000 --> 59:43.000
given what you wanted to reject, the same state of the myth and the given.

59:43.000 --> 59:49.000
Well, I don't understand this use of the phrase judgment.

59:49.000 --> 59:54.000
Can I judge something to be the case, but think it's not?

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
I was just looking for a neutral word to capture what seems to be truth.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
In some sense, it seems to me that it strikes me that these lines are different lengths.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Well, of course, you can judge that it looks that way, right?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
One looks longer than the other, but I don't think it is.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Those are two judgments, both caused by looking.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
But what's the intermediary?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Our senses are stimulated and we arrive at beliefs.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I don't see any epistemic intermediary there.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
That's one way of doing it.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Yes, I think it's the same thing.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:59.000
One of our immediate, unconsidered reactions is typical of our immediate perceptual judgments.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:07.000
But then it happens occasionally, and that's the special interest of this illusion, I think,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:17.000
that there can be, in pretty short order, a conflict between perceptual judgments.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And this conflict is theoretical at a very low level of theory.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And the whole thing can happen, of course, in the space of a minute or two.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:44.000
But one way or another, of course, a certain amount of inference goes into our perceptions anyway,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
as some of it is undoubtedly instinctive.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
It's where instinct gives us a head start on our thinking.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.000
And in other cases, there's some rudimentary thinking involved.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And this certainly shows how perception itself isn't as raw as one would be inclined to suppose it.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Good, thank you.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:21.000
My name is Brian McGee, and I'd like to ask Donald Davidson what's wrong with the following.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000
If I'm having an experience, which I would normally describe as looking at a green disc,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and somebody says to me, you are looking at a red disc,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I know, I feel justified in asserting that the statement is false,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
and I think I know that the statement is false.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
The relationship between the experience and the statement isn't a logical one,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000
because logical relationships can attain any between formulations in a symbolism.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:03.000
So here I have justification, justification for knowledge claim, justification of a statement,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
but it's not logical justification.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Well, what is the justification?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Well, that is of course one of the fundamental questions of philosophy,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:22.000
but I think that my question implies an exemplification of what the relationship is

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
between experience and knowledge claims, or can be.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Well, I think that sounds all right.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:39.000
The trouble has always been to make sense of the idea that the experience,

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
which has no propositional content in itself,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
justifies the belief that you arrive at.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
And I don't know of anybody who has ever succeeded in giving an account of that,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.000
because it requires this epistemic intermediary that we can't really...

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
It's neither a fission or a foul.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And so I think, sure, we're justified,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:21.000
but we're justified because most of our direct perceptual judgments are true.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And the explanation for that is not because they're based upon something else.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:35.000
They're rather based upon an account of how they come to have the contents they do.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I would say that we're not justified in saying that we haven't got justification

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
because we can't give an account of it.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000
We have got justification, and we know we've got it, but we can't give an account of it.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Well, I think we can.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:57.000
The justification is not of the sort of finding some little element

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000
or some magic thing in experience, which does the justifying.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000
The justification comes in the explanation for why are perceptual beliefs,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
the ones that are most immediately caused by the world,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
why they tend overwhelmingly to be true.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
So the justification isn't of that particular belief in terms of something else.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
It's rather that kind of judgment is usually right.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
And now we need to know why.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
And I think we can say why.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I'm not trying now because that's another story.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I think justification doesn't always carry you back one further step to something more basic.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Yes, Colin Howson.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Both of our distinguished speakers credit Tarski with a fundamental role

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:13.000
in the analysis of truth, presumably for natural language as well as for formalized languages.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I wonder what they would think to the following considerations,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:25.000
that the person who said to say of what is that it is is true,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
to say of what it is that it is is true,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
to say of what is that it is not is false, and then the other two variations,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000
has given in that a quite precise and clear account of truth for natural languages.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And what Tarski did was to do something to give an account of truth for languages,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000
unlike natural languages which were capable of variable interpretations.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:59.000
So the Tarski definition is an account of how you take a semantics

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:07.000
and then give the truth conditions under a whole class of different interpretations of that particular syntax.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
And that doesn't seem to me to add anything to the notion of truth,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
as far as it's concerned with natural language.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I'd like to know your opinion.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:34.000
The dissertation matter, Tarski certainly wouldn't feel particularly creative about that.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I think the value of that is just that he brings out emphatically in the open, the sort

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:51.480
of thing that does cover the whole ground, but where his prowess comes in is in setting

01:07:51.480 --> 01:08:03.600
up a recursive definition that covers the ground in a finite space, whereas if we left

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:16.680
it at the level of this quotation, there's infinitely many sentences that could be disquoted,

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:21.760
and so a finite definition wouldn't be forthcoming.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:30.600
I see Tarski's definition of truth as having the virtue of putting the truth, putting the

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:46.720
predicate into explicit, finite and eliminable form, and of course, incidentally, because

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:55.920
of the paradoxes, Tarski's definition shows that you have to take truth in a hierarchical

01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:08.800
way, and that there are more and more comprehensive truth predicates, but no limit, no most comprehensive

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.520
short of contradiction.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:17.760
This is where I admire Tarski's result.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:23.560
Maybe I could say something about that.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:30.800
Tarski himself gives a number of extremely informal characterizations of the ordinary

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:38.800
notion of truth, and among others he quotes Aristotle as you just did.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:47.120
I recently wrote a piece in which I said, I think Aristotle's characterization is better

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:54.000
than Tarski's other informal characterizations for quite explicit reasons.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.480
Tarski's informal ones include ones which make it sound as though he thinks there's

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:06.800
something that corresponds to a sentence that makes it true, the fact or something like

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:11.920
that, and one of the merits of his actual constructions is that, of course, there are

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:21.200
no entities that correspond to sentences as a whole, except his infinite sequences, the

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:31.360
satisfiers, so to speak, and they turn out not to be anything like facts, because if

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:38.760
one sequence satisfies a closed sentence, so do they all, so there's no way of picking

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:44.680
out the right facts, so to speak, in that way anyway, and Aristotle's characterization

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:51.160
also doesn't talk about something that corresponds to a sentence, and it's more like Tarski's

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:56.320
actual work than Tarski's informal characterizations.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:02.640
But the informal characterization, of course, doesn't begin to do all the work for one thing.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:14.000
It only covers sentences of certain forms, curiously though, that is, you could say it

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.640
covers just those that start with an existential quantifier or the negation of an existential

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.640
quantifier.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:28.480
Now, actually, the main example that Tarski gives is of languages that do all start that

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:38.520
way, because he doesn't have any proper names and so forth.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:45.440
But of course, it tells us, I mean, the Aristotelian characterization tells us nothing about how

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:51.680
truth is passed around, so to speak, in a language, even given the sentential connectives.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.600
Maybe negation would be the only one.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.320
It tells us a little bit about negation, but not much, but nothing about conjunction,

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.320
alternation, and so forth.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:08.320
None of the work, so to speak, that a Tarski-type truth definition does in telling us how the

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.720
truth, given finite information about a few cases, we can extend that now to an infinite

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:20.560
number of cases, which tells us the kind of articulation that not only artificial languages

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.320
of the kind he was talking about have, but so do natural languages.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:30.320
They have all those devices, and he's given us a systematic way of thinking about them

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.320
and coping with them.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:39.320
Yes, I took a different attitude towards that informal part of the Tarski thing.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:46.320
I took that as his generously administering to the vulgar mind before doing the kind of

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:54.040
thing that he saw to be really needed, namely not recognizing such entities as facts.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:08.640
Well, good, but I think he also, I mean, it's quite clear, I think, was trying to persuade

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:16.480
people that what he was going to go on to define was what they were interested in when

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.560
they talked about truth.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.560
Good, yeah, you are.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:28.560
Let Colin come back on that, finally.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:33.560
You want to come back on that, and then I think we'll wrap it up.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:40.200
I'm slightly worried about Professor Klein talking about one of the virtues being recursion

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.520
in the definition of truth, because it's very difficult to think of how you would have a

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:49.000
recursive definition for a natural language, because you just simply don't have the atomic

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.600
versus molecular structure that's given in a natural language.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:01.600
I also wonder about the unequivocal nature of the Tarski theorem that says you have

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.920
a hierarchical structure of truth.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:12.920
After all, there have been people, for example, Kripke, who, as were brought down, even for

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:19.120
a formalized language, the truth predicates into the language and showed how you could

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.480
do that consistently simply by having truth value gaps.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:28.440
It doesn't seem to me, as I say, an unequivocal verdict that Tarski showed that there was

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.120
a hierarchy of truth predicates.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:35.120
No, I think not, and I don't think that Tarski would have said so either.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.840
I certainly prefer Tarski's.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:37.840
It's more elegant.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:43.840
It enables us to adhere to our standard, you might say, neoclassical logic, which has the

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:53.240
virtue of simplicity and being so thoroughly understood, but certainly truth value gaps

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:58.240
could accomplish the same thing.

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:05.240
I think Kripke's proposal comes out rather less convenient by a good deal, and I would

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:22.240
expect Tarski to say substantially the same.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.240
Yeah, I agree.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:59.240
Thank you.
