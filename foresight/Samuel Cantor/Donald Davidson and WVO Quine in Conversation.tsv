30000	37000	In this discussion, Donald Davidson talks philosophy with his teacher and long-standing friend, W. V. Quine.
37000	45000	The discussion focuses on two broad areas of philosophy – empiricism, in which Quine is mainly interviewed by Davidson,
45000	49000	and truth, where Quine conducts the questioning.
49000	56000	In these important discussions, major differences between these two highly influential philosophers are highlighted,
56000	60000	and the differences are brought to an apparent resolution.
60000	68000	In response to Quine's opening question, Davidson clearly states his chief criticism of Quine's approach to philosophy.
68000	75000	He charges that Quine, like all empiricists, is committed to an undesirable third dogma of empiricism.
75000	80000	This is the view that all our empirical knowledge is based upon something non-propositional,
80000	84000	that is, given to us by the senses.
84000	91000	As criticism is elaborated, we see the extent to which Quine's views about the source of empirical knowledge have changed
91000	98000	– from his famous paper Two Dogmas of Empiricism through Word and Object, and up to his most recent writings.
98000	106000	Quine suggests that he no longer holds a third dogma of empiricism, but he maintains, nonetheless, that he is still an empiricist.
106000	110000	The discussion ends with a dispute about what it is to be an empiricist,
110000	113000	and Davidson's exclamation, and I quote,
113000	118000	we're in agreement, completely. It only took 50 years.
118000	123000	In the second part of the program, Quine questions Davidson on his views about truth.
123000	128000	Both philosophers agree that truth is always relative to a language,
128000	133000	but Quine holds that it is also relative to a chosen manual of translation.
133000	139000	This leads to a lively discussion encompassing both the connections between truth and translation
139000	143000	and the importance of a Tarski-style definition of truth.
143000	150000	The program ends with questions from the invited audience, from David Papineau of King's College London,
150000	156000	from the philosopher and broadcaster Brian McGee, and from Colin Hausen of the London School of Economics.
156000	160000	We join the discussion now at the London School of Economics.
160000	174000	I'm delighted to introduce my next discussant on the work of Donald Davidson.
174000	181000	I can't say he's an old friend of mine, which I'm sure Donald can say with his hand on his heart,
181000	184000	but I've had the pleasure of knowing and working with him.
184000	189000	Now it's over a period of a few years since the project that we worked.
189000	195000	On together, in conversation, Willard Van Orman, Quine, as it was,
195000	198000	and I'm absolutely delighted that he's come here today.
198000	208000	He's made a special trip from his planned itinerary to come here for his great close friend and pupil, Donald Davidson.
208000	215000	So without dragging any of this off since the time is valuable, and I'm sure you want to hear our honored guest,
215000	223000	I'd like to give you Professor Quine, emeritus professor at Harvard University, and our guest today.
223000	228000	It's a privilege and I want to get out of the way and let him get close to his friend.
228000	238000	If you sit here, be careful on the wires.
238000	248000	Well, along the middle of the century, I came out against what I called two dogmas of empiricism.
248000	262000	One was the dichotomy, the basic dichotomy, professively, of truths into the analytic,
262000	271000	or ones that depended only on the meanings of the words, and the synthetic ones, which had some factual content.
271000	282000	And the other dogma was the dogma of reductionism in the sense of there being a separable empirical content
282000	295000	to any meaningful synthetic statement, which could be isolated independently of surrounding statements.
295000	310000	And then more recently, Don, you came out against an alleged third dogma, and it's not altogether clear to me what that is.
310000	315000	Good, I'll do my best.
315000	339000	I think I heard about the first two dogmas in about 1940, and I've never deviated from the straight path with respect to them.
339000	360000	The third one, I learned, or thought I learned when I was a graduate student, to be against not only reductionism,
360000	376000	but the idea that all of our empirical knowledge, anyway, is based on something which is not itself propositional in character,
376000	392000	something that's given by the senses of, call it what you will, experience, percepts, impressions, sense data,
392000	395000	they're all these different things.
395000	401000	The search for something of this kind is easy to understand.
401000	410000	If we just start out with beliefs, we wonder how they're attached or get attached to the world.
410000	416000	So we want something that lies behind them that will justify them.
416000	431000	Nevertheless, I became convinced then, I guess partly anyway, by Sellar's article on the myth of the given,
431000	437000	that there was nothing we could find that satisfied these two conditions.
437000	445000	On the one hand, it would justify our empirical beliefs, and on the other hand, it wouldn't be propositional in character.
445000	453000	Because if it wasn't propositional in character, then it couldn't stand in a relation of justification.
453000	467000	So I remember reading some of the logical positivists that seemed to me to be having trouble with this very issue.
467000	475000	One of my teachers was C.I. Lewis, and he certainly had something like sense data.
475000	483000	So there was the school of sense data and the like on the one hand, and those who were against it,
483000	488000	and had to try to come up with something different.
489000	502000	The third dogma of empiricism I've just described, that is, it's the idea that somehow in experience,
502000	513000	we are given something which is not propositional, but which nevertheless justifies our empirical beliefs.
514000	524000	Now, U-van were very cagey about this.
524000	538000	You gave up on sense data and any of these other things, and had an alternative approach,
538000	548000	which in the end I decided nevertheless had the seeds of the same mistake or confusion.
548000	559000	Now, it's perhaps not too long a story to say how it seemed to me this was still there.
559000	566000	Of course, there were phrases in, well, let's start with two dogmas.
566000	576000	In two dogmas, there was the totality of our beliefs on the one hand, and on the other hand,
576000	585000	there was experience pressing in from the outside, and the relationship was holistic
585000	591000	and you couldn't track down the empirical content, especially to more theoretical senses,
591000	600000	to any particular place on the periphery as it was then metaphorically described.
600000	610000	But nevertheless, there was the tribunal of experience, and I remember way back then,
610000	618000	you may not remember this, but I actually read the manuscript of two dogmas in 1950
618000	625000	before you gave it when you came to the south of France and stayed with me and my then wife.
625000	634000	During that summer you had it with you, I read it, and I worried about that tribunal of experience.
634000	638000	And does it speak up?
638000	647000	If it speaks up, then it's got propositional content, but no, propositions started one stage further in.
647000	654000	So the question is, well, what exactly is the relationship between the tribunal of experience
654000	661000	and observation senses which lie right there on the periphery?
661000	673000	Now, all of that was a metaphor, and in fact it only came in at the very end as a kind of way of summing up an attitude
673000	682000	rather than a doctrine, and we're in an object, this got cashed out to a certain extent,
682000	695000	although we still were often regaled with phrases like the totality of our data come from the stimulations of our senses,
695000	699000	all of the evidence that we have.
699000	708000	And I remember stewing really for years about what exactly is the evidence in this theory.
708000	717000	But it isn't the actual firings of the nerve endings, that's not the evidence.
717000	724000	If we start with observation sentences and say they are the evidence, not that they express the evidence,
724000	732000	but that they are the evidence, that doesn't seem to be the right category for something to be evidence.
732000	743000	And I remember writing at some point there, as far as I can see, Quine doesn't have anything that really should be called the ultimate evidence.
743000	750000	He has no theory of evidence, and he agreed with this. I hope you still do.
750000	772000	Yes, I certainly don't speak of experience anymore, if I'm on my guard.
772000	785000	I think my attitude here is closer to Popper in the sense of stressing refutation rather than evidence and support.
785000	804000	And the refutation comes in predicting something which is a describable observation sentence,
804000	813000	which is a sentence that would be agreed to by all observers who are familiar with the language.
813000	821000	These are the ultimate checkpoints, as I see it.
821000	835000	And that's where the empirical content comes into our theory of nature.
835000	849000	The term evidence itself plays an essential role, I don't think it's a supporting member of the structure anymore, for me.
850000	860000	If it ever was, really, it certainly would seem so in that last page of Two Dogmas.
861000	880000	But certainly, simply from a naturalistic point of view, we need to find out what the mechanism is of finding out about the world,
881000	894000	this is simply a causal matter, which involves the neural receptors, the internal neural hookup.
895000	910000	But as far as there is an empirical content, it operates at these checkpoints, which are just here and there.
911000	918000	That's what keeps our theory honest.
918000	931000	What to call evidence in the sense of what we observe first and then leads us to make a conjecture
931000	946000	is less easy to say. We are guided partly by observations, partly by canons of simplicity, symmetry, the sort of thing that makes a theory appeal to us.
946000	958000	And to what extent that is dependable, well, I think there's still some unsolved problems there.
958000	970000	I'm wondering, in view of all this, whether I still hold the third dogma or not.
970000	984000	Well, I think it's a good question, because one of the ways in which I thought I could show that you did,
984000	994000	you've given up, I think, and that has to do with how do we determine the content of observation sentences.
994000	1004000	And at one time, it was determined by patterns of stimulation at the skin or wherever.
1005000	1010000	And there's more to the story, which I can tell if necessary.
1010000	1022000	You've partly given that up, that is, the patterns of stimulation, the actual patterns have only a very remote connection with the actual contents,
1022000	1027000	which are geared to distal objects and so forth.
1027000	1036000	Now, that in itself is to give up, in that area, anyway, of what I call the dogma of empiricism.
1036000	1050000	Well, in what sense I give that up, I would say it is, in this sense, recognizing, which was a problem back when we were in an object,
1050000	1069000	recognizing that there need be, and probably is, no substantial homology between one individual's receptors and that neural hookup and another's.
1069000	1079000	And in fact, it's in one of the earliest pages of Darwin's Origin of Species that he says regarding insects.
1079000	1096000	He says even these simple creatures have decidedly, unlike neural patterns, neural hookups, one from another.
1096000	1125000	And yes, we do somehow agree on, in our responses, we learn to agree on our responses to distal objects as if those distal objects were flashed on us with pretty much identical projections, which they're presumably not.
1126000	1143000	Well, and in word and object, faced with this problem, I assumed the homology, but I was uncomfortable with it.
1143000	1156000	And then finally, in fact, on your urging, I gave it up, but it left that question then hanging, hanging fire.
1156000	1168000	And it wasn't until some years later that I began to see my way through that, namely in terms of a pre-established harmony to borrow Leibniz's phrase,
1168000	1178000	but to a pre-established harmony which, unlike Leibniz's, was explicable causally without divine intervention.
1179000	1203000	And, namely through natural selection and adaptation of our standards of similarity with the environment, quite independently of whether there's a neural matching to any appreciable degree between one individual's intake and another.
1204000	1225000	So, well, perhaps that is the conclusion that the third dogma, that I don't hold that dogma myself.
1226000	1236000	Well, you've said that now that the third dogma's gone, really empiricism itself is gone, and I certainly haven't viewed it that way.
1236000	1249000	I continue to view myself as an empiricist, but where I have this lingering empiricism, which I think is vital, is with respect to these checkpoints,
1249000	1265000	that we don't have an out-and-out coherence of epistemology, a way of knowing.
1266000	1279000	But our procedure is tied to nature, just in that now and then we can derive something from our theory, which we can check to our satisfaction.
1279000	1302000	At least we can be fairly sure that it's wrong that the cluster of hypotheses which together have implied this experimental setup is wrong, has some false hypotheses in it.
1303000	1318000	And if we don't find that conflict, then things are all right up to the next inquiry, the next test.
1319000	1326000	I'm not persuaded even that the negative result is conclusive.
1326000	1341000	That's a point where I certainly have eased up, but that the conclusiveness of the observation senses themselves grades off.
1341000	1352000	And it's a matter of the degree to which theory has infused into these sentences.
1352000	1379000	But there is simply observably a tendency to firm agreement among observers on certain reports and not of this, an immediate agreement among those who command the language.
1383000	1390000	Well, I would say this was a lingering trace of empiricism.
1390000	1394000	Well, I don't disagree with any of that.
1394000	1398000	So if that's empiricism, I'm an empiricist too.
1399000	1417000	I was counting somebody as an empiricist only if, in effect, they thought there was some epistemically significant intermediary between the world and beliefs about it.
1417000	1428000	And let's just take observation sentences of however exactly we pick them out in a graded classification anyway.
1428000	1437000	But is there something that happens in between that is what we really use as evidence for what's beyond?
1437000	1441000	Something that's somehow given by the senses, all right.
1441000	1448000	That's what I was calling the dogma of empiricism, the third dogma.
1448000	1455000	And I thought you were originally stuck with something that was like that.
1455000	1469000	When you were counting the contents of observation sentences as being given by, that is defined by, the patterns of stimulation that caused them.
1469000	1475000	And therefore something personal, not public at all, but something personal.
1476000	1480000	So that's my idea of old-fashioned empiricism.
1480000	1486000	And I remember once a long ago quizzing you about this and saying,
1486000	1493000	but isn't your notion of stimulus meaning just doing the same sort of work that sense data did before?
1493000	1496000	And you said, yes, that's the whole idea.
1496000	1508000	Let's find something that's scientifically respectable, namely sense organs being stimulated in place of sense data.
1508000	1511000	But you wanted them to do the same work.
1511000	1524000	That is to serve as somehow allowing us to introduce something that would count as data evidence or something of that sort for our beliefs.
1524000	1531000	Now you've removed that, or let's say you've moved it to the outside world.
1531000	1541000	And now it seems to me it's not like old-fashioned empiricism anymore, it's naturalism.
1541000	1544000	And that seems to me fine.
1544000	1546000	Good.
1546000	1553000	In word and object, already in my discussion of translation, for instance,
1553000	1558000	and even in my concept of observation sentences, it was always distal.
1558000	1566000	It was always about the external world, the observation sentences themselves, it's raining, it's mama and so on.
1567000	1574000	But there was the problem of the meaning of minds,
1574000	1586000	and at that point in word and object, this lame device for accommodating it,
1586000	1596000	namely assuming that there must be in a central respects physiological homology between the receptors of one person and those of another.
1596000	1610000	And giving that up, first just giving it up and wondering, alright, how do we count for agreement.
1610000	1626000	And then seeing finally how we do, in terms of ultimately of natural selection,
1626000	1631000	that runs out that picture.
1631000	1641000	But I think a good part of this transition was in the 50s between word and object, 1950,
1641000	1650000	and I mean two dogmas, 1950, and word and object, 1960.
1650000	1661000	I found much of roots of reference was rather going back and forth between using stimulus meanings still as an important complex,
1661000	1670000	and really just explaining the contents of observation sentences in terms of distal stimuli.
1670000	1677000	And some passages did it one way and some did it another way.
1677000	1683000	And I always tried to encourage the distal one.
1683000	1698000	I even found it, in roots of reference, a page where I come very close to what I now view as the solution.
1698000	1712000	Namely the harmony of subjective standards of perceptual similarity between individuals,
1712000	1716000	an intersubjective harmony of the subjective standards.
1716000	1723000	And finally that gets explained by natural selection.
1723000	1727000	The environment being the shared thing rather than the receptors.
1727000	1734000	The environment, that is to say, shared by our ancestors.
1734000	1740000	Far enough back so that natural selection could do its work.
1740000	1746000	Well, all that seems to be exactly right.
1746000	1753000	And indeed, that was the right way to go for a long time.
1753000	1761000	Just the thing that needs emphasis from my point of view, anyway,
1761000	1778000	is we don't have any way of pulling together the various things that go into the old idea of stimulus meaning.
1778000	1783000	We don't have any way of pulling that together except by talking about the distal objects.
1783000	1787000	I mean, that's where the convergence comes as you're now saying.
1787000	1801000	So it's not as though there's some way in which as philosophers we can study how it is that the different patterns of stimulation,
1801000	1813000	nevertheless, the particular class of stimulation that do prompt us to give similar responses as table, glass, picture, and so forth.
1813000	1817000	We just say, well, that's how it came out.
1817000	1827000	And much of that, of course, can be partially explained or maybe a great deal can be explained by people who know much more neurology
1827000	1833000	and wiring of the brain and that sort of thing than we do.
1833000	1840000	But our explanation of what patterns go together, so to speak, to produce the same response,
1840000	1845000	we just say, well, what brings them together is the sameness of the response.
1845000	1852000	Not only the sameness of my responses because I respond to the very different patterns in somewhat the same way.
1852000	1858000	Never mind what the lighting is, never mind the perspective, never mind the distance.
1858000	1864000	People get a person's response under all these different conditions.
1864000	1868000	But furthermore, you do the same thing.
1868000	1878000	And all of this has a natural explanation, but it doesn't seem to me to be empiricism anymore
1878000	1882000	in one of its most characteristic phases.
1882000	1891000	Namely, somehow there's a subjective or personal thing from which I build up the whole picture of the world.
1891000	1899000	Here the picture of the world is being built up on the basis of something that we share with each other.
1899000	1915000	Yes, the divergence from an overwhelming empiricism perhaps is that within the scope of the checkpoints,
1915000	1927000	there can be such a tremendous variation in all the superstructure, all the theory, all the natural science
1927000	1935000	that systematizes and brings together our observations.
1935000	1951000	And this in fact is the sort of thing that made me make the conjecture anyway of the indeterminacy of translation of theoretical sentences.
1952000	1966000	Then there's this recent short article of yours in the Journal of Philosophy in which you announce the discovery of the distal object.
1966000	1972000	And you say, all right, now this goes for understanding another person.
1972000	1975000	That is for our theory of meaning, so to speak.
1975000	1987000	But you say, with respect to epistemology, I'm still for working with the proximal stimulus.
1987000	1998000	And now I wonder what you meant by that at this point because you've always insisted and it seems to me absolutely rightly
1998000	2004000	that theory of meaning and epistemology have to go hand in hand.
2004000	2009000	It's a major theme of roots of reference but still popped up again and again and again.
2009000	2012000	Now it looks as if they're going in two different directions.
2012000	2027000	And I wonder if that, I mean you said so little about it that I'd like to get that straight or let me say I'll urge you to bring the two back together again.
2027000	2031000	Yes, now what did I have in mind there?
2031000	2045000	The causal account of learning and of projecting a theory.
2045000	2058000	And this I viewed as a naturalization of epistemology.
2058000	2064000	And I think of myself then as a naturalized empiricist.
2065000	2078000	And so I think of the causal account as a central part of naturalized epistemology.
2078000	2087000	Well certainly the senses play a causal role in our learning and knowing anything about the outside world.
2087000	2092000	But do they play an epistemic part?
2092000	2104000	That is can we say at some particular stage in this causal process which begins with the world and ends up with beliefs.
2104000	2121000	Is there some intermediate stage where we can say something about, here's an epistemological event or a layer that's in between out there and out belief.
2122000	2127000	I don't see where it would be, you know.
2127000	2133000	Now we can stop because we're in agreement completely.
2133000	2138000	It only took 50 years.
2138000	2157000	Yes, another point I'd like to clear it up is in what sense your view of truth is transcendent rather than imminent?
2158000	2162000	Well these aren't my words, transcendent.
2162000	2167000	Heaven's not. The word never crossed my lips.
2167000	2170000	Oh for heaven's sake.
2170000	2175000	But no, it's imminent.
2175000	2186000	Of course if we're talking about language, truth is relative to language.
2186000	2191000	Or even relative to the individual's language.
2191000	2196000	That's the imminent.
2196000	2207000	But not, I would say in any sense that I understand, relative to something like a conceptual scheme.
2207000	2215000	Given what our sentences mean on occasion, they're just true or false.
2215000	2223000	Or anyway, they have fixed truth conditions and is that transcendent?
2223000	2225000	It's non-relative.
2225000	2228000	The truth of our beliefs is non-relative.
2228000	2231000	I mean they just are true or not.
2231000	2233000	At least they have truth conditions.
2233000	2237000	I mean I don't want to insist that they're always either true or false.
2237000	2242000	Maybe some of them are neither but that's just a side issue.
2242000	2244000	But they're truth conditions.
2244000	2247000	We know what it would be for our beliefs to be true.
2247000	2249000	And if they are true, they're simply true.
2249000	2252000	There's nothing relative about that.
2255000	2263000	You regard the content of the notion of truth as given completely by disquotation?
2263000	2273000	In one sense, well, there's a lot that that doesn't give us.
2273000	2283000	Disquotation only works where the language we're referring to is the same language that we're using.
2283000	2290000	And in many, many cases anyway, we can't take that for granted.
2290000	2293000	I mean if I'm talking about the truth as something you said,
2293000	2297000	disquotation can't be taken for granted.
2297000	2299000	Maybe you meant the same thing that I mean.
2299000	2303000	So I can say, well, that sentence of yours is true if and only if.
2303000	2309000	But talking about your language, I'm using mine.
2309000	2315000	And it's an empirical assumption that your sentence meant the same thing as mine does.
2315000	2316000	Quite so.
2316000	2327000	And so I think of the truth of a foreign sentence as dependent on a parameter,
2327000	2331000	which is the chosen manual of translation.
2331000	2340000	And given the conjecture of indeterminacy of translation,
2341000	2349000	that choice becomes an essential parameter.
2349000	2359000	So yes, well, that relativity of translation certainly is clear.
2359000	2378000	There's another respect which gives truth the feeling of transcendence certainly.
2378000	2382000	And I've wondered whether this is the whole thing.
2383000	2395000	Namely, when science takes a turn and something that had been accepted by the scientists
2395000	2400000	is rejected in view of some unexpected observations in regard,
2400000	2404000	it comes to be rated as false.
2404000	2411000	We don't say that even we naturalists who think of science as the last arbiter insofar
2411000	2422000	as there is one don't say that it used to be true but turned out to be false.
2422000	2429000	We say rather that we used to think it was true, but it was always false.
2429000	2435000	And that, again, is subject to what happens next time around.
2435000	2444000	Now here is a respect in which truth does go, even truth within the language,
2444000	2457000	go beyond mere disquotation and a respect in which it might be regarded as transcendent
2457000	2462000	rather than imminent than if one continues to speak in those terms.
2462000	2470000	But on the other hand, since I can see it only as a peculiarity of the idiom,
2470000	2481000	it seems a little shallow compared to what we are apt to think of as truth uncritically.
2482000	2492000	Let me pick up on the idea of truth relative to a translation manual.
2492000	2500000	Does that mean that when we are talking about the truth of something somebody else says,
2500000	2507000	that it's relative to two things, to the language and to the translation manual,
2508000	2511000	or just one thing?
2511000	2514000	I mean, my view would be there's just one thing.
2514000	2515000	And what's that one thing?
2515000	2517000	The one thing is the language.
2517000	2520000	I mean, we can name it as we please.
2520000	2527000	I think what we want to understand is a person, and there isn't a thing called a language in addition.
2527000	2530000	We have a way of interpreting.
2530000	2536000	If we have one way, we've got other ways that we could have used.
2537000	2545000	Whether we count a given utterance as having these truth conditions or those depends upon
2545000	2549000	what language we interpret them as speaking.
2549000	2552000	And that's it.
2552000	2554000	I mean, that's a relativity.
2554000	2556000	Okay.
2556000	2559000	But there isn't the second one now.
2559000	2562000	And we always knew that truth was relative to a language.
2562000	2567000	So that we take for granted.
2567000	2572000	So I don't think there are two different things that's relative to just one.
2572000	2576000	Well, yes, this is the way I view it.
2576000	2579000	Also, what would these two be?
2585000	2587000	On the one hand, there's this quotation.
2587000	2589000	That's for the language itself.
2589000	2595000	And then if you're going to speak of a sentence in another language as true,
2595000	2602000	that's going to be relative to your translation of that language or that,
2602000	2605000	ultimately, that individual's,
2605000	2608000	into your own.
2613000	2616000	There's that one.
2616000	2624000	So the two things that it's relative to as I've been breaking it down is one,
2624000	2628000	one's own language via this quotation.
2628000	2634000	Second, the manual of translation in the case of it being in another language.
2634000	2636000	Good, good.
2636000	2639000	I think that's exactly right.
2639000	2645000	Disquotation, though, isn't really doing all that much work because it's from my own Italy.
2645000	2647000	I like it right now.
2647000	2651000	And that's the best it can do.
2651000	2657000	So, but here I have this notion of truth, which I certainly am applying to somebody else.
2657000	2664000	In fact, I can't really make anything out of what they're talking about if I can't decide one way or another
2664000	2667000	what the truth conditions of their utterances are.
2667000	2678000	So that has to be a notion of truth that transcends of what disquotation is giving.
2678000	2689000	It's disquotation, if you want to think of it this way, plus interpretation.
2689000	2695000	I mean, we don't have two different notions of truth.
2695000	2707000	Well, so we're saying of this foreigner who's uttered something.
2707000	2715000	We quote that in his, put quotation marks around just a transcription direct in his language.
2715000	2726000	And we're saying that's true, if and only if, and then comes his sentence again.
2726000	2729000	But then we have the further question, so what?
2729000	2730000	What does that mean?
2730000	2732000	Then we translate.
2732000	2735000	There are those two steps.
2735000	2737000	Well, yes.
2737000	2743000	You can, another way of thinking of it, which seems to be equivalent in many ways anyway,
2743000	2747000	but I want to understand this person.
2747000	2755000	I say, well, here's my theory, or here's what I assume I know.
2755000	2763000	If he utters that sentence, then it's true if and only if so and so.
2763000	2766000	And that's what I believe.
2766000	2767000	I'm not translating.
2767000	2775000	If I write down that piece of wisdom, of course, it's going to concern two idealex, mine and his.
2775000	2780000	But my knowledge is just what the truth conditions or my view is.
2780000	2784000	What the truth conditions of what he said are these.
2784000	2789000	That's the content of my belief or my knowledge.
2789000	2801000	And I agree with you, if there's one total interpretive scheme that works, there'll be lots of others.
2801000	2810000	And they may differ to the extent of actually counting certain of his utterances true on one of the accounts that falls on another,
2810000	2817000	where I would have made up the slack with other sentences and his beliefs and so forth.
2818000	2824000	Yes, the parameter has to be strictly speaking has to be the idealex at the moment.
2824000	2826000	Right.
2829000	2833000	But let's see.
2833000	2842000	I'll try to find a difference here between us because so far I think we're in agreement.
2842000	2850000	If you think of a theory about what somebody else means as taking a fairly comprehensive form,
2850000	2854000	I mean, I'm not just have a theory about what one utterance means,
2854000	2859000	but about what a lot of other utterances do mean or would mean.
2859000	2862000	I put this in terms of sentences.
2862000	2868000	If he were to utter such and such a sentence, it would have these truth conditions.
2868000	2875000	I can specify all of this only by using something like a Tarski scheme.
2875000	2881000	I mean, if I want to cover all his senses and say what the truth conditions for all of them are,
2881000	2885000	I need some way of organizing all that.
2885000	2888000	And Tarski has shown us how to organize that.
2888000	2899000	Yes, what is Tarski's contribution here?
2899000	2904000	Of course, he brings out this point of this quotation to begin with,
2904000	2906000	that there's a contribution in itself,
2906000	2916000	although involving nothing in the way of the logical mathematical finesse that comes into his truth definition.
2916000	2922000	But what does that add?
2922000	2926000	Only the, well, two things I'd say.
2926000	2938000	For one thing, it makes for a finite definition of the class of true sentences
2938000	2945000	rather than this, simply this plan, this formula of this quotation,
2945000	2951000	which you can apply anywhere.
2951000	2956000	Also, of course, it has the virtue of, since it does give a straightforward definition,
2956000	2963000	the virtue of avoiding the paradoxes, the paradox of the liar
2963000	2971000	and bringing out the hierarchical structure of truth.
2971000	2975000	Well, I see two other virtues.
2975000	2985000	One of them is, it brings out a feature of language which isn't brought out by this quotation,
2985000	2993000	that is, how it is that you could understand a potential infinity of sentences
2993000	2996000	given just a finite amount of information.
2996000	3000000	And this quotation gives you no clue to that.
3000000	3004000	And at the same time, of course, it brings out the relations
3004000	3009000	between the truth and conditions of different sentences.
3009000	3012000	Seeing that this sentence is true under these conditions,
3012000	3016000	under these conditions, you can then see, well, then, if this sentence is true,
3016000	3018000	this one has to be true.
3018000	3029000	So those relations are organized, let's say, made explicit by a truth definition of Tarski's sword,
3029000	3033000	whereas this quotation does none of that to you.
3033000	3037000	May I add one more thing?
3037000	3045000	If, unlike Tarski, we think of one of his definitions as attempting to be a definition
3045000	3051000	for some actual language, I mean, for what somebody is doing, right?
3051000	3057000	I mean, he's not worried about that, but I'm going to worry about it.
3057000	3063000	I'm thinking of trying to organize what I know about somebody else's speech
3064000	3070000	giving a Tarski-type definition or, let's say, just a theory of about the last step of life.
3070000	3072000	But now it's an empirical theory, right?
3072000	3076000	If he says so-and-so, it's going to be true if and only if so-and-so.
3076000	3079000	That itself is true or false.
3079000	3086000	Now, according to Tarski, the totality of the T sentences is the test
3086000	3089000	of the correctness of a truth definition.
3090000	3098000	Let me now say the test of my-the correctness of my theory about what somebody else means
3098000	3102000	is whether my T sentences are right.
3102000	3105000	But how can I tell whether they're right?
3105000	3109000	Well, you've made a lot of wonderful suggestions.
3109000	3112000	I'll take the observation sentences.
3112000	3115000	I can tell whether I've got them right up to a point
3115000	3119000	by seeing under what circumstances he's inclined to assent to
3119000	3122000	or dissent from these sentences and so forth.
3122000	3128000	And we have a way with the logical constants
3128000	3133000	and then there's some hand-waving of a good sort
3133000	3136000	when it comes to the theoretical ones.
3136000	3144000	Now, that's how I test my empirical theory about somebody else.
3145000	3147000	Whether I've got it right.
3147000	3152000	Now, it seems to me all of that, since what I'm testing is a theory of truth
3152000	3159000	or for them, all of this is relevant to what I mean by the word true.
3159000	3164000	It's this kind of information which can be tested in this way.
3164000	3170000	It's how I apply the concept of truth to people.
3171000	3181000	Yes, it gives you the whole grammatical structure of the language
3181000	3190000	and it pairs off the basic lexicon
3190000	3195000	insofar as we can think of a language as having a limited basic lexicon.
3196000	3207000	And if we put it that way, it goes forward without even the predicate true.
3210000	3213000	That's what's coming out of Tarski's actual constructions.
3214000	3224000	He's got the primitive, he's got the simple predicates
3224000	3231000	and he's got the modes of combination into a longer context.
3231000	3238000	We can get rid of the true word true for any particular language.
3238000	3241000	But we can't get rid of it in general.
3242000	3250000	And we want what we do for different people to be the same sort of thing.
3254000	3260000	We don't want to say, here's this, we can eliminate for each language
3260000	3264000	but I don't know if there's anything in common between these.
3265000	3272000	Does this say more than that we can carry out parallel analyses
3272000	3282000	in terms of recursion over grammatical structures
3282000	3288000	of one language and another, any languages relative to our own?
3289000	3294000	We find out how to translate this and that mode of combination.
3295000	3297000	And we're just translating.
3299000	3308000	But our standard then of whether each of these steps is right
3308000	3316000	will depend on truth in the sense that it's depending on
3317000	3322000	whether we would affirm the one sentence when we affirm the other.
3324000	3326000	Well, it seems to me we're doing something.
3326000	3331000	You say just translating but not any old way.
3331000	3337000	We're doing it by connecting their utterances with things we observe in the world.
3337000	3344000	And it's what you're doing in your radical interpretation.
3344000	3348000	Sure, but we don't do it any old way.
3348000	3351000	We do it so as to get truth conditions.
3355000	3361000	What I can see there that makes a difference is that yes, we're doing it extensionally
3361000	3365000	rather than assisting with these sentences each step,
3365000	3370000	not only being both true or both false,
3370000	3376000	but necessarily so.
3378000	3380000	And of course, I'm all for that.
3380000	3384000	We're bypassing the modalities.
3388000	3398000	Right, I'm just trying to put the case for the idea
3398000	3406000	that we understand the concept of truth independent of disquotation.
3409000	3416000	And that comes out, it seems to me, in what it is we think we're doing
3416000	3420000	or are trying to do when we translate.
3420000	3425000	Put it in the context of the way you're thinking of it.
3426000	3430000	Why do we translate one way rather than another?
3430000	3436000	We want to translate their sense,
3436000	3441000	has these truth conditions with one of our own that has these truth conditions,
3441000	3447000	give or take the kind of slack that indeterminacy introduces.
3447000	3454000	The question is, do we have a lot of different concepts which come under the word true
3454000	3458000	or do we have one of which we're applying in many cases?
3458000	3462000	It seems to me quite clear that Tarski thought there's just one.
3462000	3465000	Yes, I would.
3467000	3470000	That's transcendence for you.
3476000	3479000	Okay, then I'll ask some of these questions.
3479000	3483000	In this instance, first one's up, David followed by Brian.
3483000	3485000	I'm David Papada.
3485000	3492000	I want to go back to the happy agreement to reject a certain conception of empiricism.
3492000	3497000	And I don't think any of us want to resuscitate the sense-state
3497000	3500000	or the myth of the given or anything like that,
3500000	3506000	but it was a bit uneasy about the way you characterised what you both agreed you wanted to reject.
3507000	3511000	Because it seemed to me you were in danger of denying something that was true.
3511000	3517000	You characterised what you wanted to reject as an intermediary between belief and the outside world
3517000	3520000	that might play some kind of epistemological role.
3520000	3524000	But it seemed to be clear that there are such things, despite what you said,
3524000	3531000	not cessated perhaps, but think of the case with somebody knowing the experiences and illusions.
3531000	3537000	But he looks at the Mullahi lines, and the arrows are pointing outwards and inwards.
3537000	3542000	And there's two lines at the same length, and you look at them and you judge that they're different lengths.
3542000	3544000	In a sense, you percentually judge the different lengths,
3544000	3549000	even though you know because you've seen the trick a number of times before, that they're the same length.
3549000	3554000	So there seems to be a case that there is something in between my belief that they're the same length,
3554000	3558000	namely my perceptual judgment, that they're different lengths.
3558000	3565000	And perhaps that perceptual judgment played a justificatory role, not in the physical one,
3565000	3569000	because in this kind of case, of course, we override it, but in the normal case,
3569000	3573000	we do form beliefs, it seems, on the basis of just such perceptual judgments.
3573000	3578000	So I wanted to know what, either or both of you would say about that,
3578000	3583000	given what you wanted to reject, the same state of the myth and the given.
3583000	3589000	Well, I don't understand this use of the phrase judgment.
3589000	3594000	Can I judge something to be the case, but think it's not?
3594000	3599000	I was just looking for a neutral word to capture what seems to be truth.
3599000	3604000	In some sense, it seems to me that it strikes me that these lines are different lengths.
3604000	3610000	Well, of course, you can judge that it looks that way, right?
3610000	3614000	One looks longer than the other, but I don't think it is.
3614000	3619000	Those are two judgments, both caused by looking.
3619000	3622000	But what's the intermediary?
3622000	3631000	Our senses are stimulated and we arrive at beliefs.
3631000	3636000	I don't see any epistemic intermediary there.
3636000	3640000	That's one way of doing it.
3640000	3645000	Yes, I think it's the same thing.
3645000	3659000	One of our immediate, unconsidered reactions is typical of our immediate perceptual judgments.
3660000	3667000	But then it happens occasionally, and that's the special interest of this illusion, I think,
3667000	3677000	that there can be, in pretty short order, a conflict between perceptual judgments.
3677000	3686000	And this conflict is theoretical at a very low level of theory.
3686000	3695000	And the whole thing can happen, of course, in the space of a minute or two.
3695000	3704000	But one way or another, of course, a certain amount of inference goes into our perceptions anyway,
3704000	3708000	as some of it is undoubtedly instinctive.
3708000	3712000	It's where instinct gives us a head start on our thinking.
3712000	3718000	And in other cases, there's some rudimentary thinking involved.
3718000	3732000	And this certainly shows how perception itself isn't as raw as one would be inclined to suppose it.
3732000	3734000	Good, thank you.
3734000	3741000	My name is Brian McGee, and I'd like to ask Donald Davidson what's wrong with the following.
3742000	3749000	If I'm having an experience, which I would normally describe as looking at a green disc,
3749000	3753000	and somebody says to me, you are looking at a red disc,
3753000	3760000	I know, I feel justified in asserting that the statement is false,
3760000	3764000	and I think I know that the statement is false.
3764000	3769000	The relationship between the experience and the statement isn't a logical one,
3769000	3775000	because logical relationships can attain any between formulations in a symbolism.
3775000	3783000	So here I have justification, justification for knowledge claim, justification of a statement,
3783000	3787000	but it's not logical justification.
3787000	3791000	Well, what is the justification?
3791000	3794000	Well, that is of course one of the fundamental questions of philosophy,
3794000	3802000	but I think that my question implies an exemplification of what the relationship is
3802000	3808000	between experience and knowledge claims, or can be.
3808000	3811000	Well, I think that sounds all right.
3811000	3819000	The trouble has always been to make sense of the idea that the experience,
3819000	3824000	which has no propositional content in itself,
3824000	3828000	justifies the belief that you arrive at.
3828000	3834000	And I don't know of anybody who has ever succeeded in giving an account of that,
3834000	3840000	because it requires this epistemic intermediary that we can't really...
3840000	3843000	It's neither a fission or a foul.
3844000	3851000	And so I think, sure, we're justified,
3851000	3861000	but we're justified because most of our direct perceptual judgments are true.
3861000	3868000	And the explanation for that is not because they're based upon something else.
3868000	3875000	They're rather based upon an account of how they come to have the contents they do.
3875000	3880000	I would say that we're not justified in saying that we haven't got justification
3880000	3883000	because we can't give an account of it.
3883000	3889000	We have got justification, and we know we've got it, but we can't give an account of it.
3889000	3891000	Well, I think we can.
3891000	3897000	The justification is not of the sort of finding some little element
3897000	3902000	or some magic thing in experience, which does the justifying.
3902000	3909000	The justification comes in the explanation for why are perceptual beliefs,
3909000	3913000	the ones that are most immediately caused by the world,
3913000	3917000	why they tend overwhelmingly to be true.
3918000	3924000	So the justification isn't of that particular belief in terms of something else.
3924000	3928000	It's rather that kind of judgment is usually right.
3928000	3931000	And now we need to know why.
3931000	3934000	And I think we can say why.
3934000	3937000	I'm not trying now because that's another story.
3937000	3947000	I think justification doesn't always carry you back one further step to something more basic.
3947000	3957000	Yes, Colin Howson.
3957000	3966000	Both of our distinguished speakers credit Tarski with a fundamental role
3966000	3973000	in the analysis of truth, presumably for natural language as well as for formalized languages.
3973000	3978000	I wonder what they would think to the following considerations,
3978000	3985000	that the person who said to say of what is that it is is true,
3985000	3988000	to say of what it is that it is is true,
3988000	3993000	to say of what is that it is not is false, and then the other two variations,
3993000	3999000	has given in that a quite precise and clear account of truth for natural languages.
3999000	4006000	And what Tarski did was to do something to give an account of truth for languages,
4006000	4012000	unlike natural languages which were capable of variable interpretations.
4012000	4019000	So the Tarski definition is an account of how you take a semantics
4019000	4027000	and then give the truth conditions under a whole class of different interpretations of that particular syntax.
4027000	4031000	And that doesn't seem to me to add anything to the notion of truth,
4031000	4034000	as far as it's concerned with natural language.
4034000	4040000	I'd like to know your opinion.
4040000	4054000	The dissertation matter, Tarski certainly wouldn't feel particularly creative about that.
4054000	4062000	I think the value of that is just that he brings out emphatically in the open, the sort
4062000	4071480	of thing that does cover the whole ground, but where his prowess comes in is in setting
4071480	4083600	up a recursive definition that covers the ground in a finite space, whereas if we left
4083600	4096680	it at the level of this quotation, there's infinitely many sentences that could be disquoted,
4096680	4101760	and so a finite definition wouldn't be forthcoming.
4101760	4110600	I see Tarski's definition of truth as having the virtue of putting the truth, putting the
4110600	4126720	predicate into explicit, finite and eliminable form, and of course, incidentally, because
4126720	4135920	of the paradoxes, Tarski's definition shows that you have to take truth in a hierarchical
4135920	4148800	way, and that there are more and more comprehensive truth predicates, but no limit, no most comprehensive
4148800	4152520	short of contradiction.
4152520	4157760	This is where I admire Tarski's result.
4157760	4163560	Maybe I could say something about that.
4163560	4170800	Tarski himself gives a number of extremely informal characterizations of the ordinary
4170800	4178800	notion of truth, and among others he quotes Aristotle as you just did.
4178800	4187120	I recently wrote a piece in which I said, I think Aristotle's characterization is better
4187480	4194000	than Tarski's other informal characterizations for quite explicit reasons.
4194000	4198480	Tarski's informal ones include ones which make it sound as though he thinks there's
4198480	4206800	something that corresponds to a sentence that makes it true, the fact or something like
4206800	4211920	that, and one of the merits of his actual constructions is that, of course, there are
4212000	4221200	no entities that correspond to sentences as a whole, except his infinite sequences, the
4221200	4231360	satisfiers, so to speak, and they turn out not to be anything like facts, because if
4231360	4238760	one sequence satisfies a closed sentence, so do they all, so there's no way of picking
4238760	4244680	out the right facts, so to speak, in that way anyway, and Aristotle's characterization
4244680	4251160	also doesn't talk about something that corresponds to a sentence, and it's more like Tarski's
4251160	4256320	actual work than Tarski's informal characterizations.
4256320	4262640	But the informal characterization, of course, doesn't begin to do all the work for one thing.
4262640	4274000	It only covers sentences of certain forms, curiously though, that is, you could say it
4274000	4280640	covers just those that start with an existential quantifier or the negation of an existential
4280640	4281640	quantifier.
4281640	4288480	Now, actually, the main example that Tarski gives is of languages that do all start that
4288520	4298520	way, because he doesn't have any proper names and so forth.
4298520	4305440	But of course, it tells us, I mean, the Aristotelian characterization tells us nothing about how
4305440	4311680	truth is passed around, so to speak, in a language, even given the sentential connectives.
4311680	4313600	Maybe negation would be the only one.
4314240	4318320	It tells us a little bit about negation, but not much, but nothing about conjunction,
4318320	4320320	alternation, and so forth.
4320320	4328320	None of the work, so to speak, that a Tarski-type truth definition does in telling us how the
4328320	4334720	truth, given finite information about a few cases, we can extend that now to an infinite
4334720	4340560	number of cases, which tells us the kind of articulation that not only artificial languages
4340880	4344320	of the kind he was talking about have, but so do natural languages.
4344320	4350320	They have all those devices, and he's given us a systematic way of thinking about them
4350320	4353320	and coping with them.
4353320	4359320	Yes, I took a different attitude towards that informal part of the Tarski thing.
4359320	4366320	I took that as his generously administering to the vulgar mind before doing the kind of
4367040	4374040	thing that he saw to be really needed, namely not recognizing such entities as facts.
4381640	4388640	Well, good, but I think he also, I mean, it's quite clear, I think, was trying to persuade
4389480	4396480	people that what he was going to go on to define was what they were interested in when
4398560	4400560	they talked about truth.
4400560	4403560	Good, yeah, you are.
4403560	4408560	Let Colin come back on that, finally.
4408560	4413560	You want to come back on that, and then I think we'll wrap it up.
4413560	4420200	I'm slightly worried about Professor Klein talking about one of the virtues being recursion
4420200	4423520	in the definition of truth, because it's very difficult to think of how you would have a
4423520	4429000	recursive definition for a natural language, because you just simply don't have the atomic
4429000	4434600	versus molecular structure that's given in a natural language.
4434600	4441600	I also wonder about the unequivocal nature of the Tarski theorem that says you have
4443720	4445920	a hierarchical structure of truth.
4445920	4452920	After all, there have been people, for example, Kripke, who, as were brought down, even for
4453240	4459120	a formalized language, the truth predicates into the language and showed how you could
4459120	4463480	do that consistently simply by having truth value gaps.
4463480	4468440	It doesn't seem to me, as I say, an unequivocal verdict that Tarski showed that there was
4468440	4470120	a hierarchy of truth predicates.
4470520	4475120	No, I think not, and I don't think that Tarski would have said so either.
4475120	4476840	I certainly prefer Tarski's.
4476840	4477840	It's more elegant.
4477840	4483840	It enables us to adhere to our standard, you might say, neoclassical logic, which has the
4486240	4493240	virtue of simplicity and being so thoroughly understood, but certainly truth value gaps
4493240	4498240	could accomplish the same thing.
4498240	4505240	I think Kripke's proposal comes out rather less convenient by a good deal, and I would
4520240	4522240	expect Tarski to say substantially the same.
4522240	4524240	Yeah, I agree.
4552240	4559240	Thank you.
