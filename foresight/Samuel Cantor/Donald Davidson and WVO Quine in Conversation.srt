1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In this discussion, Donald Davidson talks philosophy with his teacher and long-standing friend, W. V. Quine.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The discussion focuses on two broad areas of philosophy – empiricism, in which Quine is mainly interviewed by Davidson,

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and truth, where Quine conducts the questioning.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In these important discussions, major differences between these two highly influential philosophers are highlighted,

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and the differences are brought to an apparent resolution.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In response to Quine's opening question, Davidson clearly states his chief criticism of Quine's approach to philosophy.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He charges that Quine, like all empiricists, is committed to an undesirable third dogma of empiricism.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is the view that all our empirical knowledge is based upon something non-propositional,

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that is, given to us by the senses.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
As criticism is elaborated, we see the extent to which Quine's views about the source of empirical knowledge have changed

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
– from his famous paper Two Dogmas of Empiricism through Word and Object, and up to his most recent writings.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Quine suggests that he no longer holds a third dogma of empiricism, but he maintains, nonetheless, that he is still an empiricist.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The discussion ends with a dispute about what it is to be an empiricist,

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and Davidson's exclamation, and I quote,

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
we're in agreement, completely. It only took 50 years.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In the second part of the program, Quine questions Davidson on his views about truth.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Both philosophers agree that truth is always relative to a language,

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but Quine holds that it is also relative to a chosen manual of translation.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This leads to a lively discussion encompassing both the connections between truth and translation

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and the importance of a Tarski-style definition of truth.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The program ends with questions from the invited audience, from David Papineau of King's College London,

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
from the philosopher and broadcaster Brian McGee, and from Colin Hausen of the London School of Economics.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We join the discussion now at the London School of Economics.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm delighted to introduce my next discussant on the work of Donald Davidson.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I can't say he's an old friend of mine, which I'm sure Donald can say with his hand on his heart,

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
but I've had the pleasure of knowing and working with him.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now it's over a period of a few years since the project that we worked.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
On together, in conversation, Willard Van Orman, Quine, as it was,

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and I'm absolutely delighted that he's come here today.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He's made a special trip from his planned itinerary to come here for his great close friend and pupil, Donald Davidson.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So without dragging any of this off since the time is valuable, and I'm sure you want to hear our honored guest,

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'd like to give you Professor Quine, emeritus professor at Harvard University, and our guest today.

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's a privilege and I want to get out of the way and let him get close to his friend.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you sit here, be careful on the wires.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Well, along the middle of the century, I came out against what I called two dogmas of empiricism.

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:22,000
One was the dichotomy, the basic dichotomy, professively, of truths into the analytic,

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,000
or ones that depended only on the meanings of the words, and the synthetic ones, which had some factual content.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And the other dogma was the dogma of reductionism in the sense of there being a separable empirical content

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to any meaningful synthetic statement, which could be isolated independently of surrounding statements.

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And then more recently, Don, you came out against an alleged third dogma, and it's not altogether clear to me what that is.

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Good, I'll do my best.

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think I heard about the first two dogmas in about 1940, and I've never deviated from the straight path with respect to them.

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The third one, I learned, or thought I learned when I was a graduate student, to be against not only reductionism,

44
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:16,000
but the idea that all of our empirical knowledge, anyway, is based on something which is not itself propositional in character,

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:32,000
something that's given by the senses of, call it what you will, experience, percepts, impressions, sense data,

46
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
they're all these different things.

47
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The search for something of this kind is easy to understand.

48
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If we just start out with beliefs, we wonder how they're attached or get attached to the world.

49
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So we want something that lies behind them that will justify them.

50
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Nevertheless, I became convinced then, I guess partly anyway, by Sellar's article on the myth of the given,

51
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
that there was nothing we could find that satisfied these two conditions.

52
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
On the one hand, it would justify our empirical beliefs, and on the other hand, it wouldn't be propositional in character.

53
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Because if it wasn't propositional in character, then it couldn't stand in a relation of justification.

54
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So I remember reading some of the logical positivists that seemed to me to be having trouble with this very issue.

55
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
One of my teachers was C.I. Lewis, and he certainly had something like sense data.

56
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So there was the school of sense data and the like on the one hand, and those who were against it,

57
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and had to try to come up with something different.

58
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The third dogma of empiricism I've just described, that is, it's the idea that somehow in experience,

59
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:33,000
we are given something which is not propositional, but which nevertheless justifies our empirical beliefs.

60
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Now, U-van were very cagey about this.

61
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You gave up on sense data and any of these other things, and had an alternative approach,

62
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,000
which in the end I decided nevertheless had the seeds of the same mistake or confusion.

63
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Now, it's perhaps not too long a story to say how it seemed to me this was still there.

64
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Of course, there were phrases in, well, let's start with two dogmas.

65
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:36,000
In two dogmas, there was the totality of our beliefs on the one hand, and on the other hand,

66
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
there was experience pressing in from the outside, and the relationship was holistic

67
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and you couldn't track down the empirical content, especially to more theoretical senses,

68
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to any particular place on the periphery as it was then metaphorically described.

69
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But nevertheless, there was the tribunal of experience, and I remember way back then,

70
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
you may not remember this, but I actually read the manuscript of two dogmas in 1950

71
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
before you gave it when you came to the south of France and stayed with me and my then wife.

72
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:34,000
During that summer you had it with you, I read it, and I worried about that tribunal of experience.

73
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And does it speak up?

74
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If it speaks up, then it's got propositional content, but no, propositions started one stage further in.

75
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So the question is, well, what exactly is the relationship between the tribunal of experience

76
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and observation senses which lie right there on the periphery?

77
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Now, all of that was a metaphor, and in fact it only came in at the very end as a kind of way of summing up an attitude

78
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,000
rather than a doctrine, and we're in an object, this got cashed out to a certain extent,

79
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:35,000
although we still were often regaled with phrases like the totality of our data come from the stimulations of our senses,

80
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
all of the evidence that we have.

81
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And I remember stewing really for years about what exactly is the evidence in this theory.

82
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But it isn't the actual firings of the nerve endings, that's not the evidence.

83
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If we start with observation sentences and say they are the evidence, not that they express the evidence,

84
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
but that they are the evidence, that doesn't seem to be the right category for something to be evidence.

85
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I remember writing at some point there, as far as I can see, Quine doesn't have anything that really should be called the ultimate evidence.

86
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He has no theory of evidence, and he agreed with this. I hope you still do.

87
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes, I certainly don't speak of experience anymore, if I'm on my guard.

88
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I think my attitude here is closer to Popper in the sense of stressing refutation rather than evidence and support.

89
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And the refutation comes in predicting something which is a describable observation sentence,

90
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:33,000
which is a sentence that would be agreed to by all observers who are familiar with the language.

91
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
These are the ultimate checkpoints, as I see it.

92
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And that's where the empirical content comes into our theory of nature.

93
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The term evidence itself plays an essential role, I don't think it's a supporting member of the structure anymore, for me.

94
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If it ever was, really, it certainly would seem so in that last page of Two Dogmas.

95
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But certainly, simply from a naturalistic point of view, we need to find out what the mechanism is of finding out about the world,

96
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:54,000
this is simply a causal matter, which involves the neural receptors, the internal neural hookup.

97
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But as far as there is an empirical content, it operates at these checkpoints, which are just here and there.

98
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's what keeps our theory honest.

99
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What to call evidence in the sense of what we observe first and then leads us to make a conjecture

100
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:46,000
is less easy to say. We are guided partly by observations, partly by canons of simplicity, symmetry, the sort of thing that makes a theory appeal to us.

101
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And to what extent that is dependable, well, I think there's still some unsolved problems there.

102
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm wondering, in view of all this, whether I still hold the third dogma or not.

103
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Well, I think it's a good question, because one of the ways in which I thought I could show that you did,

104
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:34,000
you've given up, I think, and that has to do with how do we determine the content of observation sentences.

105
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And at one time, it was determined by patterns of stimulation at the skin or wherever.

106
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And there's more to the story, which I can tell if necessary.

107
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You've partly given that up, that is, the patterns of stimulation, the actual patterns have only a very remote connection with the actual contents,

108
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
which are geared to distal objects and so forth.

109
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Now, that in itself is to give up, in that area, anyway, of what I call the dogma of empiricism.

110
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Well, in what sense I give that up, I would say it is, in this sense, recognizing, which was a problem back when we were in an object,

111
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:49,000
recognizing that there need be, and probably is, no substantial homology between one individual's receptors and that neural hookup and another's.

112
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And in fact, it's in one of the earliest pages of Darwin's Origin of Species that he says regarding insects.

113
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:16,000
He says even these simple creatures have decidedly, unlike neural patterns, neural hookups, one from another.

114
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And yes, we do somehow agree on, in our responses, we learn to agree on our responses to distal objects as if those distal objects were flashed on us with pretty much identical projections, which they're presumably not.

115
00:18:46,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, and in word and object, faced with this problem, I assumed the homology, but I was uncomfortable with it.

116
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And then finally, in fact, on your urging, I gave it up, but it left that question then hanging, hanging fire.

117
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And it wasn't until some years later that I began to see my way through that, namely in terms of a pre-established harmony to borrow Leibniz's phrase,

118
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:38,000
but to a pre-established harmony which, unlike Leibniz's, was explicable causally without divine intervention.

119
00:19:39,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And, namely through natural selection and adaptation of our standards of similarity with the environment, quite independently of whether there's a neural matching to any appreciable degree between one individual's intake and another.

120
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So, well, perhaps that is the conclusion that the third dogma, that I don't hold that dogma myself.

121
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Well, you've said that now that the third dogma's gone, really empiricism itself is gone, and I certainly haven't viewed it that way.

122
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I continue to view myself as an empiricist, but where I have this lingering empiricism, which I think is vital, is with respect to these checkpoints,

123
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:05,000
that we don't have an out-and-out coherence of epistemology, a way of knowing.

124
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But our procedure is tied to nature, just in that now and then we can derive something from our theory, which we can check to our satisfaction.

125
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:42,000
At least we can be fairly sure that it's wrong that the cluster of hypotheses which together have implied this experimental setup is wrong, has some false hypotheses in it.

126
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And if we don't find that conflict, then things are all right up to the next inquiry, the next test.

127
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm not persuaded even that the negative result is conclusive.

128
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's a point where I certainly have eased up, but that the conclusiveness of the observation senses themselves grades off.

129
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And it's a matter of the degree to which theory has infused into these sentences.

130
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But there is simply observably a tendency to firm agreement among observers on certain reports and not of this, an immediate agreement among those who command the language.

131
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Well, I would say this was a lingering trace of empiricism.

132
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Well, I don't disagree with any of that.

133
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So if that's empiricism, I'm an empiricist too.

134
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I was counting somebody as an empiricist only if, in effect, they thought there was some epistemically significant intermediary between the world and beliefs about it.

135
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And let's just take observation sentences of however exactly we pick them out in a graded classification anyway.

136
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But is there something that happens in between that is what we really use as evidence for what's beyond?

137
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Something that's somehow given by the senses, all right.

138
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That's what I was calling the dogma of empiricism, the third dogma.

139
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And I thought you were originally stuck with something that was like that.

140
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:29,000
When you were counting the contents of observation sentences as being given by, that is defined by, the patterns of stimulation that caused them.

141
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And therefore something personal, not public at all, but something personal.

142
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So that's my idea of old-fashioned empiricism.

143
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And I remember once a long ago quizzing you about this and saying,

144
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
but isn't your notion of stimulus meaning just doing the same sort of work that sense data did before?

145
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And you said, yes, that's the whole idea.

146
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Let's find something that's scientifically respectable, namely sense organs being stimulated in place of sense data.

147
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But you wanted them to do the same work.

148
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That is to serve as somehow allowing us to introduce something that would count as data evidence or something of that sort for our beliefs.

149
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Now you've removed that, or let's say you've moved it to the outside world.

150
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And now it seems to me it's not like old-fashioned empiricism anymore, it's naturalism.

151
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And that seems to me fine.

152
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Good.

153
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
In word and object, already in my discussion of translation, for instance,

154
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and even in my concept of observation sentences, it was always distal.

155
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It was always about the external world, the observation sentences themselves, it's raining, it's mama and so on.

156
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
But there was the problem of the meaning of minds,

157
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and at that point in word and object, this lame device for accommodating it,

158
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:36,000
namely assuming that there must be in a central respects physiological homology between the receptors of one person and those of another.

159
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And giving that up, first just giving it up and wondering, alright, how do we count for agreement.

160
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And then seeing finally how we do, in terms of ultimately of natural selection,

161
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
that runs out that picture.

162
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But I think a good part of this transition was in the 50s between word and object, 1950,

163
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and I mean two dogmas, 1950, and word and object, 1960.

164
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I found much of roots of reference was rather going back and forth between using stimulus meanings still as an important complex,

165
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and really just explaining the contents of observation sentences in terms of distal stimuli.

166
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And some passages did it one way and some did it another way.

167
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And I always tried to encourage the distal one.

168
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I even found it, in roots of reference, a page where I come very close to what I now view as the solution.

169
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Namely the harmony of subjective standards of perceptual similarity between individuals,

170
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
an intersubjective harmony of the subjective standards.

171
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And finally that gets explained by natural selection.

172
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
The environment being the shared thing rather than the receptors.

173
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The environment, that is to say, shared by our ancestors.

174
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Far enough back so that natural selection could do its work.

175
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Well, all that seems to be exactly right.

176
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And indeed, that was the right way to go for a long time.

177
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Just the thing that needs emphasis from my point of view, anyway,

178
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:38,000
is we don't have any way of pulling together the various things that go into the old idea of stimulus meaning.

179
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
We don't have any way of pulling that together except by talking about the distal objects.

180
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I mean, that's where the convergence comes as you're now saying.

181
00:29:47,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So it's not as though there's some way in which as philosophers we can study how it is that the different patterns of stimulation,

182
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:13,000
nevertheless, the particular class of stimulation that do prompt us to give similar responses as table, glass, picture, and so forth.

183
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
We just say, well, that's how it came out.

184
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And much of that, of course, can be partially explained or maybe a great deal can be explained by people who know much more neurology

185
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
and wiring of the brain and that sort of thing than we do.

186
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But our explanation of what patterns go together, so to speak, to produce the same response,

187
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
we just say, well, what brings them together is the sameness of the response.

188
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Not only the sameness of my responses because I respond to the very different patterns in somewhat the same way.

189
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Never mind what the lighting is, never mind the perspective, never mind the distance.

190
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
People get a person's response under all these different conditions.

191
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
But furthermore, you do the same thing.

192
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And all of this has a natural explanation, but it doesn't seem to me to be empiricism anymore

193
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
in one of its most characteristic phases.

194
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Namely, somehow there's a subjective or personal thing from which I build up the whole picture of the world.

195
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Here the picture of the world is being built up on the basis of something that we share with each other.

196
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yes, the divergence from an overwhelming empiricism perhaps is that within the scope of the checkpoints,

197
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:07,000
there can be such a tremendous variation in all the superstructure, all the theory, all the natural science

198
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:15,000
that systematizes and brings together our observations.

199
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And this in fact is the sort of thing that made me make the conjecture anyway of the indeterminacy of translation of theoretical sentences.

200
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Then there's this recent short article of yours in the Journal of Philosophy in which you announce the discovery of the distal object.

201
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And you say, all right, now this goes for understanding another person.

202
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That is for our theory of meaning, so to speak.

203
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But you say, with respect to epistemology, I'm still for working with the proximal stimulus.

204
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And now I wonder what you meant by that at this point because you've always insisted and it seems to me absolutely rightly

205
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
that theory of meaning and epistemology have to go hand in hand.

206
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's a major theme of roots of reference but still popped up again and again and again.

207
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Now it looks as if they're going in two different directions.

208
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And I wonder if that, I mean you said so little about it that I'd like to get that straight or let me say I'll urge you to bring the two back together again.

209
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yes, now what did I have in mind there?

210
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:05,000
The causal account of learning and of projecting a theory.

211
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And this I viewed as a naturalization of epistemology.

212
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And I think of myself then as a naturalized empiricist.

213
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And so I think of the causal account as a central part of naturalized epistemology.

214
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Well certainly the senses play a causal role in our learning and knowing anything about the outside world.

215
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But do they play an epistemic part?

216
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That is can we say at some particular stage in this causal process which begins with the world and ends up with beliefs.

217
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Is there some intermediate stage where we can say something about, here's an epistemological event or a layer that's in between out there and out belief.

218
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I don't see where it would be, you know.

219
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Now we can stop because we're in agreement completely.

220
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It only took 50 years.

221
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yes, another point I'd like to clear it up is in what sense your view of truth is transcendent rather than imminent?

222
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Well these aren't my words, transcendent.

223
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Heaven's not. The word never crossed my lips.

224
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh for heaven's sake.

225
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But no, it's imminent.

226
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Of course if we're talking about language, truth is relative to language.

227
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Or even relative to the individual's language.

228
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That's the imminent.

229
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But not, I would say in any sense that I understand, relative to something like a conceptual scheme.

230
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Given what our sentences mean on occasion, they're just true or false.

231
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Or anyway, they have fixed truth conditions and is that transcendent?

232
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's non-relative.

233
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The truth of our beliefs is non-relative.

234
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I mean they just are true or not.

235
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
At least they have truth conditions.

236
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I mean I don't want to insist that they're always either true or false.

237
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Maybe some of them are neither but that's just a side issue.

238
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
But they're truth conditions.

239
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
We know what it would be for our beliefs to be true.

240
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And if they are true, they're simply true.

241
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
There's nothing relative about that.

242
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You regard the content of the notion of truth as given completely by disquotation?

243
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:53,000
In one sense, well, there's a lot that that doesn't give us.

244
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Disquotation only works where the language we're referring to is the same language that we're using.

245
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And in many, many cases anyway, we can't take that for granted.

246
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I mean if I'm talking about the truth as something you said,

247
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
disquotation can't be taken for granted.

248
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Maybe you meant the same thing that I mean.

249
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So I can say, well, that sentence of yours is true if and only if.

250
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But talking about your language, I'm using mine.

251
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And it's an empirical assumption that your sentence meant the same thing as mine does.

252
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Quite so.

253
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And so I think of the truth of a foreign sentence as dependent on a parameter,

254
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
which is the chosen manual of translation.

255
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And given the conjecture of indeterminacy of translation,

256
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:09,000
that choice becomes an essential parameter.

257
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So yes, well, that relativity of translation certainly is clear.

258
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:38,000
There's another respect which gives truth the feeling of transcendence certainly.

259
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And I've wondered whether this is the whole thing.

260
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Namely, when science takes a turn and something that had been accepted by the scientists

261
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
is rejected in view of some unexpected observations in regard,

262
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
it comes to be rated as false.

263
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
We don't say that even we naturalists who think of science as the last arbiter insofar

264
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:22,000
as there is one don't say that it used to be true but turned out to be false.

265
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,000
We say rather that we used to think it was true, but it was always false.

266
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And that, again, is subject to what happens next time around.

267
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Now here is a respect in which truth does go, even truth within the language,

268
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:57,000
go beyond mere disquotation and a respect in which it might be regarded as transcendent

269
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
rather than imminent than if one continues to speak in those terms.

270
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But on the other hand, since I can see it only as a peculiarity of the idiom,

271
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:21,000
it seems a little shallow compared to what we are apt to think of as truth uncritically.

272
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Let me pick up on the idea of truth relative to a translation manual.

273
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Does that mean that when we are talking about the truth of something somebody else says,

274
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,000
that it's relative to two things, to the language and to the translation manual,

275
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
or just one thing?

276
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I mean, my view would be there's just one thing.

277
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And what's that one thing?

278
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
The one thing is the language.

279
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I mean, we can name it as we please.

280
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I think what we want to understand is a person, and there isn't a thing called a language in addition.

281
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We have a way of interpreting.

282
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
If we have one way, we've got other ways that we could have used.

283
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Whether we count a given utterance as having these truth conditions or those depends upon

284
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
what language we interpret them as speaking.

285
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And that's it.

286
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I mean, that's a relativity.

287
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Okay.

288
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But there isn't the second one now.

289
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And we always knew that truth was relative to a language.

290
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So that we take for granted.

291
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So I don't think there are two different things that's relative to just one.

292
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Well, yes, this is the way I view it.

293
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Also, what would these two be?

294
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
On the one hand, there's this quotation.

295
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That's for the language itself.

296
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And then if you're going to speak of a sentence in another language as true,

297
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,000
that's going to be relative to your translation of that language or that,

298
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
ultimately, that individual's,

299
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
into your own.

300
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
There's that one.

301
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So the two things that it's relative to as I've been breaking it down is one,

302
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
one's own language via this quotation.

303
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Second, the manual of translation in the case of it being in another language.

304
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Good, good.

305
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I think that's exactly right.

306
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Disquotation, though, isn't really doing all that much work because it's from my own Italy.

307
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I like it right now.

308
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And that's the best it can do.

309
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So, but here I have this notion of truth, which I certainly am applying to somebody else.

310
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,000
In fact, I can't really make anything out of what they're talking about if I can't decide one way or another

311
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
what the truth conditions of their utterances are.

312
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So that has to be a notion of truth that transcends of what disquotation is giving.

313
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It's disquotation, if you want to think of it this way, plus interpretation.

314
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I mean, we don't have two different notions of truth.

315
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Well, so we're saying of this foreigner who's uttered something.

316
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:15,000
We quote that in his, put quotation marks around just a transcription direct in his language.

317
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And we're saying that's true, if and only if, and then comes his sentence again.

318
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But then we have the further question, so what?

319
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
What does that mean?

320
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Then we translate.

321
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
There are those two steps.

322
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Well, yes.

323
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
You can, another way of thinking of it, which seems to be equivalent in many ways anyway,

324
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
but I want to understand this person.

325
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I say, well, here's my theory, or here's what I assume I know.

326
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
If he utters that sentence, then it's true if and only if so and so.

327
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And that's what I believe.

328
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I'm not translating.

329
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:15,000
If I write down that piece of wisdom, of course, it's going to concern two idealex, mine and his.

330
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But my knowledge is just what the truth conditions or my view is.

331
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
What the truth conditions of what he said are these.

332
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
That's the content of my belief or my knowledge.

333
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And I agree with you, if there's one total interpretive scheme that works, there'll be lots of others.

334
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And they may differ to the extent of actually counting certain of his utterances true on one of the accounts that falls on another,

335
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
where I would have made up the slack with other sentences and his beliefs and so forth.

336
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yes, the parameter has to be strictly speaking has to be the idealex at the moment.

337
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Right.

338
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But let's see.

339
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I'll try to find a difference here between us because so far I think we're in agreement.

340
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:30,000
If you think of a theory about what somebody else means as taking a fairly comprehensive form,

341
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I mean, I'm not just have a theory about what one utterance means,

342
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
but about what a lot of other utterances do mean or would mean.

343
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I put this in terms of sentences.

344
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
If he were to utter such and such a sentence, it would have these truth conditions.

345
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I can specify all of this only by using something like a Tarski scheme.

346
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I mean, if I want to cover all his senses and say what the truth conditions for all of them are,

347
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I need some way of organizing all that.

348
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And Tarski has shown us how to organize that.

349
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yes, what is Tarski's contribution here?

350
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Of course, he brings out this point of this quotation to begin with,

351
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
that there's a contribution in itself,

352
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:36,000
although involving nothing in the way of the logical mathematical finesse that comes into his truth definition.

353
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,000
But what does that add?

354
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Only the, well, two things I'd say.

355
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:58,000
For one thing, it makes for a finite definition of the class of true sentences

356
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:05,000
rather than this, simply this plan, this formula of this quotation,

357
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
which you can apply anywhere.

358
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Also, of course, it has the virtue of, since it does give a straightforward definition,

359
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,000
the virtue of avoiding the paradoxes, the paradox of the liar

360
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and bringing out the hierarchical structure of truth.

361
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Well, I see two other virtues.

362
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:45,000
One of them is, it brings out a feature of language which isn't brought out by this quotation,

363
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:53,000
that is, how it is that you could understand a potential infinity of sentences

364
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
given just a finite amount of information.

365
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And this quotation gives you no clue to that.

366
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And at the same time, of course, it brings out the relations

367
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
between the truth and conditions of different sentences.

368
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Seeing that this sentence is true under these conditions,

369
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
under these conditions, you can then see, well, then, if this sentence is true,

370
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
this one has to be true.

371
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So those relations are organized, let's say, made explicit by a truth definition of Tarski's sword,

372
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
whereas this quotation does none of that to you.

373
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
May I add one more thing?

374
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:45,000
If, unlike Tarski, we think of one of his definitions as attempting to be a definition

375
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
for some actual language, I mean, for what somebody is doing, right?

376
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I mean, he's not worried about that, but I'm going to worry about it.

377
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I'm thinking of trying to organize what I know about somebody else's speech

378
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,000
giving a Tarski-type definition or, let's say, just a theory of about the last step of life.

379
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But now it's an empirical theory, right?

380
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
If he says so-and-so, it's going to be true if and only if so-and-so.

381
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
That itself is true or false.

382
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Now, according to Tarski, the totality of the T sentences is the test

383
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
of the correctness of a truth definition.

384
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Let me now say the test of my-the correctness of my theory about what somebody else means

385
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
is whether my T sentences are right.

386
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
But how can I tell whether they're right?

387
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Well, you've made a lot of wonderful suggestions.

388
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I'll take the observation sentences.

389
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I can tell whether I've got them right up to a point

390
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
by seeing under what circumstances he's inclined to assent to

391
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
or dissent from these sentences and so forth.

392
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And we have a way with the logical constants

393
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
and then there's some hand-waving of a good sort

394
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
when it comes to the theoretical ones.

395
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Now, that's how I test my empirical theory about somebody else.

396
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Whether I've got it right.

397
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Now, it seems to me all of that, since what I'm testing is a theory of truth

398
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,000
or for them, all of this is relevant to what I mean by the word true.

399
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
It's this kind of information which can be tested in this way.

400
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It's how I apply the concept of truth to people.

401
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yes, it gives you the whole grammatical structure of the language

402
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:10,000
and it pairs off the basic lexicon

403
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
insofar as we can think of a language as having a limited basic lexicon.

404
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And if we put it that way, it goes forward without even the predicate true.

405
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
That's what's coming out of Tarski's actual constructions.

406
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:44,000
He's got the primitive, he's got the simple predicates

407
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,000
and he's got the modes of combination into a longer context.

408
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,000
We can get rid of the true word true for any particular language.

409
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
But we can't get rid of it in general.

410
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And we want what we do for different people to be the same sort of thing.

411
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We don't want to say, here's this, we can eliminate for each language

412
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
but I don't know if there's anything in common between these.

413
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Does this say more than that we can carry out parallel analyses

414
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:42,000
in terms of recursion over grammatical structures

415
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,000
of one language and another, any languages relative to our own?

416
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
We find out how to translate this and that mode of combination.

417
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And we're just translating.

418
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:08,000
But our standard then of whether each of these steps is right

419
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:16,000
will depend on truth in the sense that it's depending on

420
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
whether we would affirm the one sentence when we affirm the other.

421
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Well, it seems to me we're doing something.

422
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
You say just translating but not any old way.

423
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
We're doing it by connecting their utterances with things we observe in the world.

424
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And it's what you're doing in your radical interpretation.

425
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Sure, but we don't do it any old way.

426
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
We do it so as to get truth conditions.

427
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
What I can see there that makes a difference is that yes, we're doing it extensionally

428
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
rather than assisting with these sentences each step,

429
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
not only being both true or both false,

430
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,000
but necessarily so.

431
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And of course, I'm all for that.

432
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
We're bypassing the modalities.

433
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Right, I'm just trying to put the case for the idea

434
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:46,000
that we understand the concept of truth independent of disquotation.

435
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And that comes out, it seems to me, in what it is we think we're doing

436
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
or are trying to do when we translate.

437
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Put it in the context of the way you're thinking of it.

438
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Why do we translate one way rather than another?

439
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:16,000
We want to translate their sense,

440
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
has these truth conditions with one of our own that has these truth conditions,

441
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,000
give or take the kind of slack that indeterminacy introduces.

442
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:34,000
The question is, do we have a lot of different concepts which come under the word true

443
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
or do we have one of which we're applying in many cases?

444
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
It seems to me quite clear that Tarski thought there's just one.

445
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yes, I would.

446
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
That's transcendence for you.

447
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Okay, then I'll ask some of these questions.

448
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
In this instance, first one's up, David followed by Brian.

449
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm David Papada.

450
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I want to go back to the happy agreement to reject a certain conception of empiricism.

451
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And I don't think any of us want to resuscitate the sense-state

452
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
or the myth of the given or anything like that,

453
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
but it was a bit uneasy about the way you characterised what you both agreed you wanted to reject.

454
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Because it seemed to me you were in danger of denying something that was true.

455
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,000
You characterised what you wanted to reject as an intermediary between belief and the outside world

456
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
that might play some kind of epistemological role.

457
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But it seemed to be clear that there are such things, despite what you said,

458
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:51,000
not cessated perhaps, but think of the case with somebody knowing the experiences and illusions.

459
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But he looks at the Mullahi lines, and the arrows are pointing outwards and inwards.

460
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And there's two lines at the same length, and you look at them and you judge that they're different lengths.

461
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
In a sense, you percentually judge the different lengths,

462
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
even though you know because you've seen the trick a number of times before, that they're the same length.

463
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So there seems to be a case that there is something in between my belief that they're the same length,

464
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
namely my perceptual judgment, that they're different lengths.

465
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:25,000
And perhaps that perceptual judgment played a justificatory role, not in the physical one,

466
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
because in this kind of case, of course, we override it, but in the normal case,

467
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
we do form beliefs, it seems, on the basis of just such perceptual judgments.

468
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So I wanted to know what, either or both of you would say about that,

469
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
given what you wanted to reject, the same state of the myth and the given.

470
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Well, I don't understand this use of the phrase judgment.

471
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Can I judge something to be the case, but think it's not?

472
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I was just looking for a neutral word to capture what seems to be truth.

473
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,000
In some sense, it seems to me that it strikes me that these lines are different lengths.

474
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Well, of course, you can judge that it looks that way, right?

475
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
One looks longer than the other, but I don't think it is.

476
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Those are two judgments, both caused by looking.

477
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
But what's the intermediary?

478
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Our senses are stimulated and we arrive at beliefs.

479
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I don't see any epistemic intermediary there.

480
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
That's one way of doing it.

481
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Yes, I think it's the same thing.

482
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:59,000
One of our immediate, unconsidered reactions is typical of our immediate perceptual judgments.

483
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:07,000
But then it happens occasionally, and that's the special interest of this illusion, I think,

484
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:17,000
that there can be, in pretty short order, a conflict between perceptual judgments.

485
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And this conflict is theoretical at a very low level of theory.

486
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And the whole thing can happen, of course, in the space of a minute or two.

487
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:44,000
But one way or another, of course, a certain amount of inference goes into our perceptions anyway,

488
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
as some of it is undoubtedly instinctive.

489
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
It's where instinct gives us a head start on our thinking.

490
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And in other cases, there's some rudimentary thinking involved.

491
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And this certainly shows how perception itself isn't as raw as one would be inclined to suppose it.

492
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Good, thank you.

493
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:21,000
My name is Brian McGee, and I'd like to ask Donald Davidson what's wrong with the following.

494
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:29,000
If I'm having an experience, which I would normally describe as looking at a green disc,

495
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and somebody says to me, you are looking at a red disc,

496
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I know, I feel justified in asserting that the statement is false,

497
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
and I think I know that the statement is false.

498
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
The relationship between the experience and the statement isn't a logical one,

499
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,000
because logical relationships can attain any between formulations in a symbolism.

500
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:03,000
So here I have justification, justification for knowledge claim, justification of a statement,

501
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
but it's not logical justification.

502
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Well, what is the justification?

503
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Well, that is of course one of the fundamental questions of philosophy,

504
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:22,000
but I think that my question implies an exemplification of what the relationship is

505
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,000
between experience and knowledge claims, or can be.

506
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Well, I think that sounds all right.

507
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:39,000
The trouble has always been to make sense of the idea that the experience,

508
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
which has no propositional content in itself,

509
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
justifies the belief that you arrive at.

510
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And I don't know of anybody who has ever succeeded in giving an account of that,

511
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:00,000
because it requires this epistemic intermediary that we can't really...

512
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
It's neither a fission or a foul.

513
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And so I think, sure, we're justified,

514
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:21,000
but we're justified because most of our direct perceptual judgments are true.

515
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And the explanation for that is not because they're based upon something else.

516
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:35,000
They're rather based upon an account of how they come to have the contents they do.

517
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I would say that we're not justified in saying that we haven't got justification

518
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
because we can't give an account of it.

519
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
We have got justification, and we know we've got it, but we can't give an account of it.

520
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Well, I think we can.

521
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,000
The justification is not of the sort of finding some little element

522
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
or some magic thing in experience, which does the justifying.

523
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:09,000
The justification comes in the explanation for why are perceptual beliefs,

524
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
the ones that are most immediately caused by the world,

525
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
why they tend overwhelmingly to be true.

526
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,000
So the justification isn't of that particular belief in terms of something else.

527
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
It's rather that kind of judgment is usually right.

528
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
And now we need to know why.

529
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
And I think we can say why.

530
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I'm not trying now because that's another story.

531
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I think justification doesn't always carry you back one further step to something more basic.

532
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Yes, Colin Howson.

533
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Both of our distinguished speakers credit Tarski with a fundamental role

534
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:13,000
in the analysis of truth, presumably for natural language as well as for formalized languages.

535
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I wonder what they would think to the following considerations,

536
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:25,000
that the person who said to say of what is that it is is true,

537
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
to say of what it is that it is is true,

538
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
to say of what is that it is not is false, and then the other two variations,

539
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
has given in that a quite precise and clear account of truth for natural languages.

540
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:46,000
And what Tarski did was to do something to give an account of truth for languages,

541
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,000
unlike natural languages which were capable of variable interpretations.

542
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:59,000
So the Tarski definition is an account of how you take a semantics

543
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:07,000
and then give the truth conditions under a whole class of different interpretations of that particular syntax.

544
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
And that doesn't seem to me to add anything to the notion of truth,

545
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
as far as it's concerned with natural language.

546
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I'd like to know your opinion.

547
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:34,000
The dissertation matter, Tarski certainly wouldn't feel particularly creative about that.

548
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I think the value of that is just that he brings out emphatically in the open, the sort

549
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:51,480
of thing that does cover the whole ground, but where his prowess comes in is in setting

550
01:07:51,480 --> 01:08:03,600
up a recursive definition that covers the ground in a finite space, whereas if we left

551
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:16,680
it at the level of this quotation, there's infinitely many sentences that could be disquoted,

552
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:21,760
and so a finite definition wouldn't be forthcoming.

553
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:30,600
I see Tarski's definition of truth as having the virtue of putting the truth, putting the

554
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:46,720
predicate into explicit, finite and eliminable form, and of course, incidentally, because

555
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:55,920
of the paradoxes, Tarski's definition shows that you have to take truth in a hierarchical

556
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:08,800
way, and that there are more and more comprehensive truth predicates, but no limit, no most comprehensive

557
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,520
short of contradiction.

558
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:17,760
This is where I admire Tarski's result.

559
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:23,560
Maybe I could say something about that.

560
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:30,800
Tarski himself gives a number of extremely informal characterizations of the ordinary

561
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:38,800
notion of truth, and among others he quotes Aristotle as you just did.

562
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:47,120
I recently wrote a piece in which I said, I think Aristotle's characterization is better

563
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:54,000
than Tarski's other informal characterizations for quite explicit reasons.

564
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,480
Tarski's informal ones include ones which make it sound as though he thinks there's

565
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:06,800
something that corresponds to a sentence that makes it true, the fact or something like

566
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,920
that, and one of the merits of his actual constructions is that, of course, there are

567
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:21,200
no entities that correspond to sentences as a whole, except his infinite sequences, the

568
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:31,360
satisfiers, so to speak, and they turn out not to be anything like facts, because if

569
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:38,760
one sequence satisfies a closed sentence, so do they all, so there's no way of picking

570
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:44,680
out the right facts, so to speak, in that way anyway, and Aristotle's characterization

571
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:51,160
also doesn't talk about something that corresponds to a sentence, and it's more like Tarski's

572
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:56,320
actual work than Tarski's informal characterizations.

573
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:02,640
But the informal characterization, of course, doesn't begin to do all the work for one thing.

574
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:14,000
It only covers sentences of certain forms, curiously though, that is, you could say it

575
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,640
covers just those that start with an existential quantifier or the negation of an existential

576
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,640
quantifier.

577
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:28,480
Now, actually, the main example that Tarski gives is of languages that do all start that

578
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:38,520
way, because he doesn't have any proper names and so forth.

579
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:45,440
But of course, it tells us, I mean, the Aristotelian characterization tells us nothing about how

580
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:51,680
truth is passed around, so to speak, in a language, even given the sentential connectives.

581
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,600
Maybe negation would be the only one.

582
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:58,320
It tells us a little bit about negation, but not much, but nothing about conjunction,

583
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,320
alternation, and so forth.

584
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:08,320
None of the work, so to speak, that a Tarski-type truth definition does in telling us how the

585
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:14,720
truth, given finite information about a few cases, we can extend that now to an infinite

586
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:20,560
number of cases, which tells us the kind of articulation that not only artificial languages

587
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,320
of the kind he was talking about have, but so do natural languages.

588
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:30,320
They have all those devices, and he's given us a systematic way of thinking about them

589
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,320
and coping with them.

590
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:39,320
Yes, I took a different attitude towards that informal part of the Tarski thing.

591
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:46,320
I took that as his generously administering to the vulgar mind before doing the kind of

592
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:54,040
thing that he saw to be really needed, namely not recognizing such entities as facts.

593
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:08,640
Well, good, but I think he also, I mean, it's quite clear, I think, was trying to persuade

594
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:16,480
people that what he was going to go on to define was what they were interested in when

595
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,560
they talked about truth.

596
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,560
Good, yeah, you are.

597
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:28,560
Let Colin come back on that, finally.

598
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,560
You want to come back on that, and then I think we'll wrap it up.

599
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:40,200
I'm slightly worried about Professor Klein talking about one of the virtues being recursion

600
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,520
in the definition of truth, because it's very difficult to think of how you would have a

601
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:49,000
recursive definition for a natural language, because you just simply don't have the atomic

602
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,600
versus molecular structure that's given in a natural language.

603
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:01,600
I also wonder about the unequivocal nature of the Tarski theorem that says you have

604
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,920
a hierarchical structure of truth.

605
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:12,920
After all, there have been people, for example, Kripke, who, as were brought down, even for

606
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:19,120
a formalized language, the truth predicates into the language and showed how you could

607
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,480
do that consistently simply by having truth value gaps.

608
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:28,440
It doesn't seem to me, as I say, an unequivocal verdict that Tarski showed that there was

609
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,120
a hierarchy of truth predicates.

610
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,120
No, I think not, and I don't think that Tarski would have said so either.

611
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,840
I certainly prefer Tarski's.

612
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,840
It's more elegant.

613
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,840
It enables us to adhere to our standard, you might say, neoclassical logic, which has the

614
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:53,240
virtue of simplicity and being so thoroughly understood, but certainly truth value gaps

615
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:58,240
could accomplish the same thing.

616
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:05,240
I think Kripke's proposal comes out rather less convenient by a good deal, and I would

617
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,240
expect Tarski to say substantially the same.

618
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,240
Yeah, I agree.

619
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:59,240
Thank you.
