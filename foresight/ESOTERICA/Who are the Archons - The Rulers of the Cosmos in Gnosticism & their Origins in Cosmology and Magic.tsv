0	4480	Perhaps one of the most scandalous tenets of some schools of ancient Christianity is
4480	12600	that the cosmos around us is inherently evil, forged by a psychopathic demiurge and ruled
12600	18320	over by a host of planetary demons bent on nothing less than the torture and enslavement
18320	22800	of the divine spark hidden within each human being.
22800	27040	The origin and nature of those rulers are archons and ancient Greek remains one of the
27040	32480	more obscure issues in this quite honestly provocative theology.
32480	38600	But the discovery of a wealth of ancient magical texts and a small library from Egypt has shed
38600	45480	more light on the very beings these Christians felt must be finally defeated and surpassed
45480	49560	as the soul escaped our cosmic prison.
49560	54520	In this episode I want to explore what we know about the archons, their origins in
54520	60160	Greco-Egyptian cosmology and magic and how ancient Christians, though now known often
60160	66680	as Gnostic so problematically, thought they could soar beyond the terrible clutches of
66680	68560	these beings.

107520	116760	But now let's explore the wardens, the prison guards of our cosmic cell, our cosmic prison,
116760	120200	the archons of ancient Gnosticism.
120200	128960	I'm Justin Sledge and welcome to Esoterica where we explore the arcane in history, philosophy,
128960	129480	and religion.
137520	157400	The world of the second and especially the third centuries of the common era was a world
157400	163040	increasingly coming apart, a world tearing itself apart at the seams, especially from
163040	167120	within the traditional perspective of ancient Egypt, it was something of an apocalypse,
167120	170320	it was really the end of the world of ancient Egypt.
170320	174840	Centuries of Hellenistic hegemony, Roman conquest, along with widespread economic and political
174840	181280	stability made for a world very much worth escaping.
181280	188120	And a great many schools of theological, spiritual, and philosophical escapism, frankly, emerged.
188120	194520	The inward turn of stoicism as a coping philosophy, the mystical ascent spiritualities of Jewish
194600	201480	Merkava and Hermetic philosophies, and the afterlife oriented anti-worldly redemption
201480	210080	offered by the Christianities made for a veritable menu of technologies for just that
210080	211880	cosmic escape.
211880	218560	Perhaps none was more radical, none more extreme than the early species of Christianity that
218560	221920	have come down to be known as Gnosticism.
221920	226640	Now to be frank, I just don't have time to do a deep dive into the incredibly complex
226640	232160	mythologies of the Sethians and the Valentinians and the Ophites and the Basilideanians or
232160	236680	the Canites, though I've done episodes on many of those and they are probably worth
236680	243120	watching, especially the episode on the Apocryphal John and the section on the Valentinian Christianity.
243120	246280	Those are going to be really important connective tissues to get an idea of what's going on
246280	247280	in this video.
247280	250400	In fact, I have a whole Gnosticism playlist you can check out if you're interested in
250400	256680	really going deep on the Gnostic train, but the central thrust shared by many of these
256680	263360	theologies is that the true reality is a spiritual reality, not this.
263360	267720	It's a spiritual reality presided over by an ineffable deity whose outflowing, whose
267720	273040	emanations generated a host of beings known as the fullness or the pluroma in Greek.
273040	278880	However, one such entity, Sophia, or wisdom, sought to create on her own without the consent
278880	281240	of the great invisible spirit.
281240	289400	This mistake created a horrifying being, a nightmarish creature known variously as Sacklas,
289400	293840	Samael, Yaldabaoth, or the Demiurge.
293840	298760	Unlike Platonism, Stoicism, Judaism, or other species of Christianity, for whom the creator
298760	304000	of this world was a benevolent deity who created a maximally beautiful world, a maximally
304000	314680	good world, these Christians held that the physical cosmos was a kind of prison, ruled
314680	320680	over by that hideous Demiurge, the craftsperson, along with a retinue of malevolent beings
320680	325000	known as the rulers, or archons, in ancient Greek.
325000	331960	In this myth, the upper spiritual realm ultimately takes pity on us, the poor human beings,
331960	339240	and smuggles within them a divine spiritual spark, and ultimately sends Christ, Jesus,
339240	345040	who reveals the truth about our cosmos and the means by which to escape it, and, of course,
345040	349200	to return with him, finally, to that divine light.
349200	353680	Of course I'm greatly simplifying the mythology there is an enormous amount of variation both
353680	358920	in these schools of thought and between them, frankly there's not just one Gnosticism,
358920	364680	but in a structural sense the core myth system remains remarkably consistent.
364680	369160	There's an effable spiritual reality in which a metaphysical tragedy occurs engendering the
369160	375200	creation of the malevolent Demiurge, which in turn creates the physical reality around
375200	382000	us, the physical cosmos, in which divine elements are trapped or encased within human beings,
382000	385920	and we as human beings have to escape this world.
385920	390520	In this episode, however, I want to focus in on one element, just one element of this
390520	397800	mythology, the origins and nature of the cosmic prism wardens as it were, the archons.
397800	402240	Now of course I'll be coming back to do another episode on the origins of the most shocking
402240	407840	element in all of this, the origins and nature of the evil creator, or the Demiurge, Saclas,
407840	413720	Samael, Yaldabaoth, but the archons turn out to be a crucially important element in this
413760	421160	mythology because in a very important sense they have created this physical prism, including
421160	425800	our bodies in which we are trapped and deluded into believing this is all real, they are
425800	432920	responsible for tricking us into believing that any of this is real, and even our thoughts
432920	438920	and emotions are just inner puppetry to control us, and that these entities must be ultimately
439000	445440	defeated and bypassed in our final jailbreak back to the spiritual world of light, beauty,
445440	446960	and oneness.
446960	451760	So what do we really know about the archons?
451760	457200	The term archon would have struck ancient years as powerfully political, though without
457200	462480	much of the majesty or any association with royalty, I think that's important, thus
462480	467640	a Latin equivalent might be magistrate or governor, they're basically political functionaries
467720	473880	who have ruled locally but not totally, and if you've ever worked in retail, they're
473880	481080	like the assistant manager with a chip on their shoulder who get off on making your life miserable
481080	486800	because they got picked on when they were little, they need therapy, not managerial positions.
486800	490440	Most of what we know about the archons can be found spread through the literature written
490440	494880	by the so-called Gnostic Christians themselves, and the polemics against some written by other
494920	498720	Christians such as Irenaeus, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius.
498720	503920	As I've mentioned earlier, in most of these mythological systems, these are beings created
503920	511800	or somehow generated by the malevolent divvijurge, both for its own narcissistic needs, but also
511800	519360	to act as secondary creators and enforcers of this physical prison cosmos.
519440	526320	In an important sense, they are the beings most intimately responsible for this whole mess,
526320	531280	and also they are the first major hurdle that one faces in one's escape back to the realm of
531280	538080	spiritual fullness, so I hope you could understand that knowing a bit about them seems germane to
538080	545680	making just that escape. Many, if not most, of the Gnostic creation myths contain some mention
545760	551680	of the archons, though the details on them vary greatly from text to text. Perhaps the most
551680	556720	instructive and popular narrative is represented by the Apocryphon of John, or the secret teachings
556720	562880	of John. Following the ignorant and mistaken creation of Yaldabaoth, the divvijurge with
562880	569200	the hideous body of a snake in the head of a lion, its eyes flashing as if bolts of lightning,
569680	576320	that being Yaldabaoth mates with itself, it mates with the mindlessness within itself,
576320	582640	to produce a series of 12 fiery beings. The names of many of these beings have their origins in
582640	589360	Jewish mythology, while others are more mysterious. Very strange, I'll come back to those in just
589360	595440	a minute toward the end of the episode. The first series of 12 archons probably represents the
595440	604080	creation of the zodiac, and thus the fixed dome of the cosmic system. This is sort of the
604080	610160	background of everything. Now, from among these, and separately, are extracted. Again, the text is
610160	613920	confused here, and it's probably two separate traditions that have been fused together in the
613920	620640	Apocryphon of John, but from these it seems that 12 independent kings are pointed over the spheres
620720	625440	of the heavens. These seven rulers are thus associated with the visible planets or the
625440	631520	wandering stars of the geocentric world. These beings represent not only the spatial dimensions
631520	636960	above us, but also the course of time itself, corresponding as the text says to the days of
636960	642960	the week. We even learn a bit about their physical appearance, each having the face of various animals
642960	649360	such as a sheep, a donkey, a hyena, even one of flaming fire. This is a feature that probably has
649360	654320	its origins in traditional Egyptian religious iconography. It's typically the idea of human
654320	659520	being like creatures having the heads of animals in religious depictions of gods. The demiurge,
659520	665520	having created these rulers, then transferred some of his fire to them, perhaps activating them or
665520	671120	emanating them at some level, such that they would believe he's, well, he's the only god,
671120	677920	and in his equally ignorant and narcissistic declaration, I am god. There is no god aside
677920	683440	from me, taken from the Genesis creation story. There's immediately issued a declaration which
683440	689840	is basically a rebuttal by a voice from the upper supernal spiritual realm. In fact, Yaldavoth goes
689840	697920	so far as to model his inverse realm of darkness and matter, our world, on the supernal realm,
697920	704560	though often with satanic inversions mirroring the upper worlds. And from these, the archons would
704640	713200	emerge 365 angels, though it would be better to think of them as demons for, well, for obvious
713200	719760	reasons. Once the physical world or our cosmic prison was constructed, the demiurge decided,
719760	725760	again, in an act of extreme narcissism to create a being in his own image. However,
725760	730080	it apparently required the aid of the archon demons and thus Yaldavoth declared,
730160	737360	let us, let us make human beings in our image. This is, by the way, the hermeneutical answer
737360	742560	given by the Gnostics to that statement in Genesis that's in the plural, the radical plural, rather
742560	749600	than the divine singular, which is anomalous. It's not the monarchic plural. It's literally a bunch
749600	755360	of demons making human beings. The apocryphon of John infamously identifying the creator of the biblical
755360	763120	Genesis story with the evil demiurge. But Yaldavoth, the archons are demons and they all set
763120	768800	forth to create the primordial human being, each forging a specific anatomical feature,
768800	773680	first the psychical features, the psychical elements of the body, and then the physical
773680	780320	elements of the primordial human body, the Adam. Again, many of these names of the beings that
780320	784960	construct our physical bodies and our psychical bodies are very obscure and I'll come back to
784960	790560	them in just a moment. Following the creation of the 365 elements of the psychical body, remember
790560	795680	there's 365 of these archons of some level, including this would include psychical states such
795680	802000	as desires, emotions, fear, grief, the love of pleasure, etc. Well, the heavenly mother at that
802000	810800	point took pity on the primordial Adam and breathed through Yaldavoth life into this psychical body,
810880	815840	of course due to the ignorance of the archons, which are as malevolent as they are stupid,
815840	820480	frankly. They didn't realize that by working together that they would create a psychical
820480	825520	Adam that would be more powerful than all of them individually. The psychical Adam was
825520	831120	constructed by all of them, therefore had all their powers with our powers combined. They
831120	837200	just created a being that could best all of them. Further enlightened insight was cast down,
837280	843200	put down, into from the spiritual realm, into the psychical body, giving human beings the ability
843200	848640	to recognize at least the truth of their condition, something that the archons certainly couldn't do.
848640	855200	Well, maybe with one exception. But realizing their mistake, the archons mixed together, earth,
855200	861280	air, fire, and water, they mixed together hule, matter, and cast this psychical body into a
861280	867360	prison of matter. This is our physical bodies and then put that physical body in a garden of
867360	874240	delights, a garden of pleasure, a garden of Eden meant to intoxicate the Adam, therefore basically
874800	878640	intoxicating him with pleasure such that he would never realize that his condition,
879280	884640	nor realize his power, and therefore never realized that he could in fact escape.
885600	891760	But all of this is crucially important for considering our condition for these Christians.
891760	896640	Not only is our physical body a prison, a point well made in dualistic theories like this,
897200	903760	but ultimately even our psychical body is a prison. What we think of as our mental and emotional life
903760	910800	are all created by the archons for precisely keeping us in prison shackled within delusions
910800	916320	and emotions, thus not only as our physical body a prison, but also the negative thoughts and emotions
916320	922960	which blind us to things like rage and fear and jealousy and love of pleasure. In a sense,
922960	927760	because we are created by the archons, our psychical and physical bodies are created by the
927760	935200	archons, they've left a hideous imprint of themselves in our psyches. And in a sense,
935200	939280	we're created like people possessed as our natural condition. We're like
940160	946400	marionettes controlled by the archons. It's only through our enlightened insight which came to us
946400	952160	from the spiritual realm and the dedication of us to our spiritual life, which Adam only recognized
952160	957920	by the way in the creation of Eve, or Chava, life, that we have the ability and the means to transcend
957920	964640	our otherwise condition of being a demonic puppet. In fact, the Apocalypse of John rejects the concept
964640	969840	of Eve being merely a derivative of Adam. The text in fact notes that it was not from a rib,
969840	975680	as Moses says, but Eve was actually made from the very image of enlightened insight that was found
975680	982400	within Adam. Regardless, the primary role of the archons in this element of the mythology
982400	987680	is to explain how our physical, and I think even more importantly, our psychical bodies,
987680	992720	having their origin in the contorted horrors of the archons, the demons,
993360	999440	set the primary condition for our entrapment in this prison cosmos.
1000240	1003600	Now, the elaborate mythologies of these texts are at face value.
1004720	1008960	They're pretty wild. I mean, Irenaeus just thought he could convince you that they're not true by
1008960	1014160	distilling you what the Gnostics believe. And further, they're very much beyond the pale
1014240	1018400	of virtually any such narrative about the human condition and antiquity. I mean,
1019040	1025040	everyone admitted the world wasn't perfect, sure, but that this was all literally created by demons
1025040	1030640	as a prison? That was a bit much, frankly. An adherence of this spirituality clearly felt the
1030640	1036480	need to defend this idea both by appealing to widely accepted Christian scriptures and by
1036480	1041840	greatly clarifying the nature of these various myths. I mean, you could just add more detail to
1041840	1047600	make it even stranger and somehow that made it more believable. And that's precisely what we
1047600	1052960	find in an important text found in the fourth tractate of the second Nagamadi codex, a text
1052960	1058480	variously known as the hypothesis of the archons or the reality of the rulers or the nature of the
1058480	1063200	archons. There's a lot of ways of translating this depending on how you want to deal with the
1063200	1070880	technical term, hupustasis in Greek. It's, well, it's technical. In this text, the author seems
1070880	1076240	to be welding together two previous documents in order to show that the archons are one, very
1076240	1081840	much real, and two, they must be vanquished. And he does this by introducing the text with a paraphrase
1081840	1087200	of the very famous quotation of Colossians 1.3, allegedly written by Paul, that the followers
1087200	1092720	of Christ do not struggle against the flesh, but against the authorities, the archons of the world,
1092720	1099040	and the spirits of wickedness. In fact, other Pauline or school of Paul texts even hint that
1099040	1105280	these beings live in the sky, Ephesians 3.10 and 6.12. And over at Colossians 2.8 and 2.20,
1105280	1112080	it even refers to them as elemental spirits of the universe, thus linking them at some level,
1112080	1117120	perhaps, with this vile materiality, at least in the minds of the Gnostics. Thus, the text is meant
1117120	1122640	to outline the reality and nature of the archons. In this text, the reality of the rulers, we learn
1122640	1128240	that the archons are androgyne. In fact, Yaldabaoth is also androgyne, and they have the faces of the
1128240	1134960	beasts, as we noted earlier, and that they literally huffed and puffed in a failed attempt to raise
1134960	1142480	the primordial, atomic body to life. All to no avail, they couldn't bring him to life. Only
1142480	1148720	when the supernal breath flowed into him could he be animated. Again, you get the sense that the
1148720	1156880	archons are pretty stupid. But not only stupid, they're hideously rapacious, and this text,
1156880	1162080	like others, the archons immediately attempt to pounce on Eve to assault her once they've created
1162080	1167440	her. However, again, their stupidity is their downfall. She outwits them, and she turns herself
1167440	1173440	into a tree, perhaps an echo of the Daphne legend in Greek mythology. But the archons being horrible
1173440	1181440	go on to assault the mere shadow that she had left behind, again, their vileness only being matched by
1181520	1187680	their idiocy. Indeed, the rapacious fervor of the archons would emerge again and again when they
1187680	1193040	attempted to assault Norea, the daughter of Adam and Eve, a crucially important character in these
1193040	1198720	mis-systems. In fact, Norea, she gets her own episode. She's really, really important. Her whole
1198720	1205120	book's dedicated to Norea. The demonic archons threaten Norea, demanding that she submit to them
1205120	1211760	sexually as Eve had done, at least as they claim Eve had done. However, Norea actually knew the
1211760	1217280	truth that Eve hadn't submitted to them. She knew that she tricked them, and having special insight,
1217280	1223760	she cried out to the upper spiritual realms, and taking pity on her, the angelic being Eleth descends,
1224320	1228160	driving away the archons, and the rest of the text takes the form of a kind of
1229200	1233200	something like an early Gnostic catechism. In fact, some scholars believe it was a literal
1233200	1238480	read out loud catechistic text with Norea interrogating Eleth about the true nature of
1238480	1242960	reality, and much of the details repeated there are actually found in others at the
1242960	1249280	end text, especially texts like the Apocryphon of John, though there is a really important,
1249280	1255520	relatively novel account concerning one archon, Sabaoth. Remember when I said that Yael the
1255520	1262880	Baoth declared that it was the only god only to be shided from a voice from above? That shiding
1262880	1269120	was actually done by the angelic power of life, Zoe, the daughter of faith wisdom, or Pistis Sophia,
1269120	1277200	who has her own very complicated book. Well, in this text, the archon Sabaoth actually sees this
1277200	1282960	moment. He's high enough up in the emanations that he sees Zoe rebuke, so Yael the Baoth, and
1282960	1289520	Zoe's breath becomes a fire in the face of Yael the Baoth, and she casts him it down into the
1289520	1295440	bottom of the abyss and to Tartarus. The archon Sabaoth realizes Yael the Baoth is a liar, he
1295440	1300640	rejects the divinity of Yael the Baoth, and rather he sends his prayers to the supernal realm,
1300640	1307200	and in reward for that is actually elevated to the highest station he can be in this cosmic prison.
1307200	1312640	He gets to go up to the eighth heaven, nearest to the divine fullness or pluroma, and he creates
1312640	1318240	for himself the Ezekiel style chariot throne we typically associate with Yael. Thus the quasi
1318240	1323840	beneficent archon Sabaoth is ultimately flanked by Zoe, or the supernal life, and is given control
1323840	1330320	over an angel of wrath, and then given rulership over this entire cosmic realm, thus lessening,
1331280	1336960	at least to some degree the more extreme dualism associated with this mythology. As for Yael the
1336960	1342320	Baoth, of course he rages in envy, Sabaoth is given all this power, and that envy gives birth
1342320	1349760	to death, and that death pollutes our entire cosmic realm. Numerous other versions of this
1349760	1354640	archontic mythology exist in various forms of ancient Christian literature. One of the more
1354640	1360240	fascinating is a partially preserved by Origen in his polemic against Celsus. Here we find details
1360240	1365600	from a sect typically referred to as the Ophites, from the word snake who apparently admired the
1365600	1371760	wisdom bequeathing snake of the Garden of Eden, who the archons sought to destroy. In their mythology
1371760	1376080	the snake really revealed to us all the wisdom, and the archons tried to get rid of him. And what
1376080	1381680	has come down to us as the Ophite diagram, we have what seems to have been a kind of esoteric
1381680	1387760	geometric representation or diagram of reality, from the supernal realms all the way down to the
1387760	1393440	infernal realms, with a series of seven archons which may have been generations of Yael the Baoth,
1393440	1399200	sort of Yael the Baoth emanating itself, though again the text isn't clear, in fact there are
1399200	1404240	two different layers of the text and it's preserved by Origen. But interestingly enough here the
1404240	1409520	archons actually include classic archangels, again with beastly heads, though one of them is clearly
1409520	1415600	a corrupt version of the Hebrew Tohu Vovohu, the primordial chaos out of which creation is drawn
1415600	1421520	there in the first creation story. Interestingly also, the entire system is actually bounded at
1421520	1427600	two levels by Leviathan and Behemoth as something like world souls for the psychical and material
1427600	1433120	realms respectively. So here Leviathan and Behemoth play a role, though exactly what that
1433120	1439040	role is isn't clear. Truth be told the exact nature of the Ophite diagram is debated, there are
1439040	1443280	lots of different representations, and this is probably just a good idea to say this will be a
1443280	1448880	future episode. Another very important text is the incredibly learned, brilliant text on the
1448880	1453920	origin of the world found just after reality of the rulers in the Nagamani library, and it also
1453920	1459360	contains a list of archons which the text refers to as the Seven Powers of the Heavens of Chaos.
1461600	1467600	Band name alert. At any rate, three of these, Yael and Aloai and Ostafaios, are actually denoted as
1467600	1475040	directly sons of Yael de Baoth. Also good band name. This wonderful text, one of my favorites
1475040	1479920	actually from the Nagamani library, details how the other archons actually went to war against the
1479920	1485200	righteous Archon Sabahoth, and in triumph he would go on to create the Seraphim, the angels that
1485200	1492320	rotate around the throne saying holy holy holy, to celebrate Sabahoth and eventually he's responsible
1492320	1501120	for creating Jesus. Sabahoth in this myth creates Jesus Christ himself, thus at least in this myth
1501120	1506720	cycle the rebel Archon Sabahoth who creates Jesus, he's empowered from above and would eventually
1506720	1512320	be sent into our realm to teach the path of redemption, thus in a very important sense.
1513280	1519120	It's actually an Archon, a redeemed Archon, but an Archon that ultimately provides the path
1519680	1524960	to salvation via the teachings of Christ. In fact salvation, it isn't clear that Sabahoth
1524960	1531760	himself even has access to. He might not be able to escape this realm, somehow making him all the
1531840	1537920	more noble. Sabahoth really is the MVP of this system. And even though it's not directly related
1537920	1543680	to this whole Archon business, if you're a fan of Thunder Perfect Mine, and if you're not a fan of
1543680	1548400	Thunder Perfect Mine, you should just unsubscribe and go somewhere else. You absolutely have to read
1548400	1552880	On the Origin of the World. There's a surprise in there related to Thunder. I won't ruin what it is,
1554320	1559280	but there's an Easter Egg, a Thunder Perfect Mine Easter Egg in On the Origins of the World.
1560160	1565280	Other texts, like the Mammoth, Pistis Sophia seem to have only five Archons, but they do
1565280	1570960	include Hecate and Typhon, interestingly enough. And later, Polymical Text also detail various
1570960	1576320	Archons as they occur in different kinds of sects of Gnosticism. The most comprehensive of those
1576320	1583040	can be found in texts like the Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis, which is a positively fascinating
1583040	1589920	collection of anti-heresy texts. In fact, the Panarion even details a rather late surviving
1589920	1594720	sect in the fourth century that he denotes for their belief, precisely for their belief in the
1594720	1599760	Archons. He refers to them as the Archontics. It may have been the case that the belief in the
1599760	1605520	Archons had simply become scarce by the fourth century, though it seems that the text notes
1605520	1610400	that it was taught by a certain man named Peter near what is now modern-day Chavron. But we have
1610400	1615600	there an interesting story where this monk-like Gnostic character, Peter, converts a traveling
1615600	1622080	Armenian Christian named Utaktos. Epiphanius makes one of his names constantly, but Utaktos goes on
1622080	1627280	to respread belief in the Archons through the region of Armenia and Palestine, perhaps making
1627280	1633040	for a renaissance in this belief before its basic final disappearance from history, with the exception
1633040	1639120	of the Bogomils, the Cathars, and the Mandeans. This curious section of the text allegedly provides,
1639200	1643600	and again, you should trust Epiphanius as far as you can see him. In fact, some of the scriptures
1643600	1648800	that the Archontics use, we have a text called the Greater and Lesser Harmonies, the Elogenes,
1648800	1653200	which might actually survive in the Nagamadi Library, and also they seem to have employed
1653200	1657920	the ascension of Isaiah, a pretty popular text in early Christianity, and one that over time
1657920	1662480	will become later associated with the Bogomils and eventually the Cathars. If you're interested
1662480	1667760	in the Cathars, I have several episodes about them and whether or not they really existed.
1668320	1672240	Some of their teachings on the nature of the Archons, especially interesting in that they
1672240	1676880	argued that the eighth highest heaven was again headed by Sabaoth, something we've seen on the
1676880	1682080	origin of the world, and that they had a lower seven tiered heaven just below that, though in
1682080	1688640	their system, Satan is actually created by Sabaoth, who is in turn giving rulership over this world,
1688640	1693120	the physical world Satan dominates it for now. Again, this is an interesting inversion of the
1693120	1698480	begetting relationships of these Gnostic mythologies, and the other mythology Yaldabaoth generates
1698480	1704960	Sabaoth, who supplants him here for the Archontics, it's the other way around. The Archontics also
1704960	1708800	rejected sacraments, including baptism, because they were all performed in the name of the false
1708800	1713760	god Sabaoth, even though he's the highest one of this realm, he's still fake. Further, by rejecting
1713760	1718400	the sacraments in the laws of this world, their souls began to make the ascent. It's by rejecting
1718400	1724240	the sacraments of the Catholic Church, they start their ascent up, making defensive speeches before
1724240	1730240	each Archon, before finally arriving back at the mother of the Pluroma. This is perhaps Sophia,
1730240	1735280	wisdom, you get back to be with Sophia. Of course, there's a great deal more of interest in this
1735280	1740880	sect, and you can read about it in the Panarion. Whose name, by the way, Panarion means bread basket,
1740880	1746960	so this text always gave me like olive garden vibes. Regardless, this is just a must read text
1746960	1751760	for anyone interested in Gnosticism. Even if you're sympathetic Gnosticism, you can often read
1751760	1757120	these heresiological literature like Irenaeus or Hippolytus, and you get so much wonderful
1757120	1761760	information that it's very much worth reading. In fact, I've done a very long episode on Irenaeus,
1761760	1766800	one of the earliest sort of anti-Gnostic heresiologists, and you may want to check it out.
1766800	1770480	It's one of my favorite episodes I've made about Gnosticism on the channel.
1771120	1775680	Now, any reader of these texts, especially Pistis Sophia and the Apocryphon of John,
1775680	1781120	will face a significant degree of bewilderment at some of the names of the Archons, or their
1781120	1788080	attending angels, demons. So the natural question is just the origins of both the system of Archons,
1788080	1794480	and why do they have these bizarre names? Why are they named this? The origin question,
1794480	1800720	while not ever going to be definitively answered, is probably likely maybe that it was common in
1800720	1805440	the ancient world to attach angels, demons, and daimons to the various celestial regions and
1805520	1809440	antiquity, and the various celestial objects in antiquity. In fact, this would continue well
1809440	1815120	under the Middle Ages with angels basically moving planets around as their efficient causation,
1815120	1819520	and even with magical texts like the Arbital with its various system of invocation of planetary
1819520	1825760	spirits. Thus, the 12-fold division followed by a 7-fold division followed then by a 365-fold
1825760	1831360	division, which is found again on the Apocryphon of John. Well, it just nicely captures the circular
1831360	1836880	dome of the zodiac as the outermost sphere of the geocentric cosmos, in which the moon and the sun
1836880	1843360	and the five classical wandering stars, the planets, move about followed by 365 days of the
1843360	1850080	solar year. Thus, insofar as the Archons are at the origin and control the fate of the material and
1851120	1856080	psychical cosmos, including our physical and psychical bodies, they would go from the fixed
1856080	1860800	stars at the very limit to the very outer edge to the wandering stars down to the days of the year.
1860880	1865040	This all gives them power over both the physical cosmos of space,
1865040	1871680	but also the processional cosmos of time. It's basically the demonization of the
1871680	1878240	attending beings at work in the cosmos of antiquity. If you take those and just make them all evil,
1878240	1885440	well, they go from being angels and diamonds to being archons. Now, the more difficult issue
1885440	1890800	is the often bewildering names given to these beings. Now, many of them are clearly derived
1890800	1896240	from Hebrew Aramaic divine names, which are then transposed and corrupted into Greek and Comptic.
1896240	1901040	These are sometimes traditional angelic names, which simply undergo demonization. A great many
1901040	1908000	of the others, frankly, are perplexing in origin. This is especially true for names like Yaldabaoth,
1908000	1912800	although there's some guessing that this is maybe Aramaic or Hebrew for the child of chaos or the
1912880	1919440	begetter of chaos, the maternal spirit Barbello, which again has a kind of Aramaic feel to it,
1919440	1924160	and the host of archons and angel demons found especially in the names of the beings responsible
1924160	1929760	for the construction of the primordial, Adamical body in the Apocryphon of John, or the profusion
1929760	1934160	of entities that populate the treasuries of the books of you and the pistis Sophia among
1935280	1940960	a great many other Gnostic texts. But the situation here isn't totally hopeless. We're not totally
1940960	1945040	hopeless in terms of finding out where these names may have come from. Interestingly enough,
1945040	1949920	some of these obscure names are actually found not just in Gnostic literature, but they're also
1949920	1955200	found in the great archangian collection known to us as the Greek Magical Papyri. In a really
1955200	1961120	fascinating article, the classicist Howard Jackson locates numerous instances in which many of these
1961120	1968320	archontic names are also found in a wide range of magical uses, such as Incantations, Nomina
1968320	1973280	Barbara, which is very important here, and sigil-like uses in the Greek Magical Papyri.
1973280	1978800	I agree, I think, with his assessment that either the two bodies of literature of Gnostic and Magical
1978800	1983200	share a common ancestor, that is to say, perhaps they go back to something like the Indigenous
1983200	1987920	or Egyptian ritual technology, and there's clearly definitely Egyptian words in some of this,
1988560	1993280	and I think one that's slightly more likely is that the Gnostic texts are actually lifting many
1993280	1998960	of these archontic names from the Magical literature in the Egyptian context in which these texts,
1998960	2006720	the Gnostic texts, were being composed. Thus, we might very well have a kind of magic to Gnosticism
2006720	2012320	pipeline in the ancient world, and that even might give us a glimpse into the milieu of the
2012320	2019680	authors that generated these Gnostic texts. In fact, this is all more, all the more reinforced,
2019680	2024720	given the definite similarities between the rare instances of Gnostic ritual life,
2024720	2029280	especially something like the complex baptism rituals to be found in texts like The Books of
2029280	2034960	You, which I've made a whole episode about those, and the wider range of Greco-Egyptian magic.
2034960	2040000	There's just no way that those baptism rituals, which are found in books like The Gnostic Book of
2040000	2044880	You and the magical technologies found in the Greek Magical Papyri, are just not related,
2045440	2051120	simply not happening. So what I suspect occurred, and again, we'll never know, was a theological
2051120	2056080	shift very much like the one described quite wonderfully, actually, in M. David Litwas in
2056080	2061600	his book The Evil Creator, which you absolutely should read, in which the Israelite God is somehow
2061600	2067680	demonized, and then a two-step process by which the angels' daimons responsible for the movements
2067680	2074560	and processes of the cosmos in the Judeo-Hellenistic worldview of the time were themselves, in turn,
2074560	2080880	demonized in sets of 12, 7, and 365, though again, the texts aren't terribly systematic,
2080880	2086720	nor uniform, frankly, though I do think that a set of seven archons seems to have been the
2086720	2092640	standard among this literature. And finally, these archontic beings, they receive their names
2092640	2097600	largely derived from Jewish and Greco-Egyptian sources, often traditional Jewish scriptures,
2097600	2103760	but also especially the complex world of Greco-Egyptian magic. Of course, this theory does not,
2103840	2109520	by any means, eliminate all the mysteries of the origins and nature of the archons. In fact,
2110160	2114240	this would be an excellent application of something like AI, along with a database of
2114240	2120800	ancient spirit, daimons, archons, nomina, Barbara, etc., as envisioned by Dr. Kristin Switzer,
2120800	2125280	who I really hope it's a funding to make just that database. You can find out more about her
2125280	2130320	in the description. By the way, if you're interested in ancient magic, you absolutely have to check
2130320	2136000	out her channel, Dr. Switzer. It's one of the best resources out there on just that topic.
2136000	2141520	At any rate, while the evil demiurge Yael the Baoth often, well, frankly steals the show,
2141520	2146560	perhaps because of our love for anything with a flair for the Lovecraftian, I hope I've shown
2146560	2154640	that the archons also play a decisively important role, even a surprising role in this wonderfully
2154720	2161840	weird mythology. I mean, you hardly ever hear about the renegade archon responsible for recreating
2161840	2166720	Jesus, or the connections of the archons with Greco-Egyptian magic more generally.
2167360	2174000	In these ways, among many others, their role is often downplayed, it's often overshadowed because
2174000	2180160	we love talking about the evil demiurge, and I think that's a mistake if you want to really
2180160	2186240	robustly understand these mythologies. As usual, I've included a collection of resources if you
2186240	2190560	want to really dive into Gnosticism in the description. Again, also check out my playlist
2190560	2197840	on Gnosticism to really go through a bunch of these texts. But until next time, keep resisting
2197840	2204960	those archontic, psychical impulses and ascend into the subvernal realms. Of course, also thanks
2204960	2212160	for watching Esoterica, where we explore the arcane in history, philosophy and religion.
