00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
Perhaps one of the most scandalous tenets of some schools of ancient Christianity is

00:04.480 --> 00:12.600
that the cosmos around us is inherently evil, forged by a psychopathic demiurge and ruled

00:12.600 --> 00:18.320
over by a host of planetary demons bent on nothing less than the torture and enslavement

00:18.320 --> 00:22.800
of the divine spark hidden within each human being.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.040
The origin and nature of those rulers are archons and ancient Greek remains one of the

00:27.040 --> 00:32.480
more obscure issues in this quite honestly provocative theology.

00:32.480 --> 00:38.600
But the discovery of a wealth of ancient magical texts and a small library from Egypt has shed

00:38.600 --> 00:45.480
more light on the very beings these Christians felt must be finally defeated and surpassed

00:45.480 --> 00:49.560
as the soul escaped our cosmic prison.

00:49.560 --> 00:54.520
In this episode I want to explore what we know about the archons, their origins in

00:54.520 --> 01:00.160
Greco-Egyptian cosmology and magic and how ancient Christians, though now known often

01:00.160 --> 01:06.680
as Gnostic so problematically, thought they could soar beyond the terrible clutches of

01:06.680 --> 01:08.560
these beings.

01:47.520 --> 01:56.760
But now let's explore the wardens, the prison guards of our cosmic cell, our cosmic prison,

01:56.760 --> 02:00.200
the archons of ancient Gnosticism.

02:00.200 --> 02:08.960
I'm Justin Sledge and welcome to Esoterica where we explore the arcane in history, philosophy,

02:08.960 --> 02:09.480
and religion.

02:17.520 --> 02:37.400
The world of the second and especially the third centuries of the common era was a world

02:37.400 --> 02:43.040
increasingly coming apart, a world tearing itself apart at the seams, especially from

02:43.040 --> 02:47.120
within the traditional perspective of ancient Egypt, it was something of an apocalypse,

02:47.120 --> 02:50.320
it was really the end of the world of ancient Egypt.

02:50.320 --> 02:54.840
Centuries of Hellenistic hegemony, Roman conquest, along with widespread economic and political

02:54.840 --> 03:01.280
stability made for a world very much worth escaping.

03:01.280 --> 03:08.120
And a great many schools of theological, spiritual, and philosophical escapism, frankly, emerged.

03:08.120 --> 03:14.520
The inward turn of stoicism as a coping philosophy, the mystical ascent spiritualities of Jewish

03:14.600 --> 03:21.480
Merkava and Hermetic philosophies, and the afterlife oriented anti-worldly redemption

03:21.480 --> 03:30.080
offered by the Christianities made for a veritable menu of technologies for just that

03:30.080 --> 03:31.880
cosmic escape.

03:31.880 --> 03:38.560
Perhaps none was more radical, none more extreme than the early species of Christianity that

03:38.560 --> 03:41.920
have come down to be known as Gnosticism.

03:41.920 --> 03:46.640
Now to be frank, I just don't have time to do a deep dive into the incredibly complex

03:46.640 --> 03:52.160
mythologies of the Sethians and the Valentinians and the Ophites and the Basilideanians or

03:52.160 --> 03:56.680
the Canites, though I've done episodes on many of those and they are probably worth

03:56.680 --> 04:03.120
watching, especially the episode on the Apocryphal John and the section on the Valentinian Christianity.

04:03.120 --> 04:06.280
Those are going to be really important connective tissues to get an idea of what's going on

04:06.280 --> 04:07.280
in this video.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.400
In fact, I have a whole Gnosticism playlist you can check out if you're interested in

04:10.400 --> 04:16.680
really going deep on the Gnostic train, but the central thrust shared by many of these

04:16.680 --> 04:23.360
theologies is that the true reality is a spiritual reality, not this.

04:23.360 --> 04:27.720
It's a spiritual reality presided over by an ineffable deity whose outflowing, whose

04:27.720 --> 04:33.040
emanations generated a host of beings known as the fullness or the pluroma in Greek.

04:33.040 --> 04:38.880
However, one such entity, Sophia, or wisdom, sought to create on her own without the consent

04:38.880 --> 04:41.240
of the great invisible spirit.

04:41.240 --> 04:49.400
This mistake created a horrifying being, a nightmarish creature known variously as Sacklas,

04:49.400 --> 04:53.840
Samael, Yaldabaoth, or the Demiurge.

04:53.840 --> 04:58.760
Unlike Platonism, Stoicism, Judaism, or other species of Christianity, for whom the creator

04:58.760 --> 05:04.000
of this world was a benevolent deity who created a maximally beautiful world, a maximally

05:04.000 --> 05:14.680
good world, these Christians held that the physical cosmos was a kind of prison, ruled

05:14.680 --> 05:20.680
over by that hideous Demiurge, the craftsperson, along with a retinue of malevolent beings

05:20.680 --> 05:25.000
known as the rulers, or archons, in ancient Greek.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.960
In this myth, the upper spiritual realm ultimately takes pity on us, the poor human beings,

05:31.960 --> 05:39.240
and smuggles within them a divine spiritual spark, and ultimately sends Christ, Jesus,

05:39.240 --> 05:45.040
who reveals the truth about our cosmos and the means by which to escape it, and, of course,

05:45.040 --> 05:49.200
to return with him, finally, to that divine light.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.680
Of course I'm greatly simplifying the mythology there is an enormous amount of variation both

05:53.680 --> 05:58.920
in these schools of thought and between them, frankly there's not just one Gnosticism,

05:58.920 --> 06:04.680
but in a structural sense the core myth system remains remarkably consistent.

06:04.680 --> 06:09.160
There's an effable spiritual reality in which a metaphysical tragedy occurs engendering the

06:09.160 --> 06:15.200
creation of the malevolent Demiurge, which in turn creates the physical reality around

06:15.200 --> 06:22.000
us, the physical cosmos, in which divine elements are trapped or encased within human beings,

06:22.000 --> 06:25.920
and we as human beings have to escape this world.

06:25.920 --> 06:30.520
In this episode, however, I want to focus in on one element, just one element of this

06:30.520 --> 06:37.800
mythology, the origins and nature of the cosmic prism wardens as it were, the archons.

06:37.800 --> 06:42.240
Now of course I'll be coming back to do another episode on the origins of the most shocking

06:42.240 --> 06:47.840
element in all of this, the origins and nature of the evil creator, or the Demiurge, Saclas,

06:47.840 --> 06:53.720
Samael, Yaldabaoth, but the archons turn out to be a crucially important element in this

06:53.760 --> 07:01.160
mythology because in a very important sense they have created this physical prism, including

07:01.160 --> 07:05.800
our bodies in which we are trapped and deluded into believing this is all real, they are

07:05.800 --> 07:12.920
responsible for tricking us into believing that any of this is real, and even our thoughts

07:12.920 --> 07:18.920
and emotions are just inner puppetry to control us, and that these entities must be ultimately

07:19.000 --> 07:25.440
defeated and bypassed in our final jailbreak back to the spiritual world of light, beauty,

07:25.440 --> 07:26.960
and oneness.

07:26.960 --> 07:31.760
So what do we really know about the archons?

07:31.760 --> 07:37.200
The term archon would have struck ancient years as powerfully political, though without

07:37.200 --> 07:42.480
much of the majesty or any association with royalty, I think that's important, thus

07:42.480 --> 07:47.640
a Latin equivalent might be magistrate or governor, they're basically political functionaries

07:47.720 --> 07:53.880
who have ruled locally but not totally, and if you've ever worked in retail, they're

07:53.880 --> 08:01.080
like the assistant manager with a chip on their shoulder who get off on making your life miserable

08:01.080 --> 08:06.800
because they got picked on when they were little, they need therapy, not managerial positions.

08:06.800 --> 08:10.440
Most of what we know about the archons can be found spread through the literature written

08:10.440 --> 08:14.880
by the so-called Gnostic Christians themselves, and the polemics against some written by other

08:14.920 --> 08:18.720
Christians such as Irenaeus, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius.

08:18.720 --> 08:23.920
As I've mentioned earlier, in most of these mythological systems, these are beings created

08:23.920 --> 08:31.800
or somehow generated by the malevolent divvijurge, both for its own narcissistic needs, but also

08:31.800 --> 08:39.360
to act as secondary creators and enforcers of this physical prison cosmos.

08:39.440 --> 08:46.320
In an important sense, they are the beings most intimately responsible for this whole mess,

08:46.320 --> 08:51.280
and also they are the first major hurdle that one faces in one's escape back to the realm of

08:51.280 --> 08:58.080
spiritual fullness, so I hope you could understand that knowing a bit about them seems germane to

08:58.080 --> 09:05.680
making just that escape. Many, if not most, of the Gnostic creation myths contain some mention

09:05.760 --> 09:11.680
of the archons, though the details on them vary greatly from text to text. Perhaps the most

09:11.680 --> 09:16.720
instructive and popular narrative is represented by the Apocryphon of John, or the secret teachings

09:16.720 --> 09:22.880
of John. Following the ignorant and mistaken creation of Yaldabaoth, the divvijurge with

09:22.880 --> 09:29.200
the hideous body of a snake in the head of a lion, its eyes flashing as if bolts of lightning,

09:29.680 --> 09:36.320
that being Yaldabaoth mates with itself, it mates with the mindlessness within itself,

09:36.320 --> 09:42.640
to produce a series of 12 fiery beings. The names of many of these beings have their origins in

09:42.640 --> 09:49.360
Jewish mythology, while others are more mysterious. Very strange, I'll come back to those in just

09:49.360 --> 09:55.440
a minute toward the end of the episode. The first series of 12 archons probably represents the

09:55.440 --> 10:04.080
creation of the zodiac, and thus the fixed dome of the cosmic system. This is sort of the

10:04.080 --> 10:10.160
background of everything. Now, from among these, and separately, are extracted. Again, the text is

10:10.160 --> 10:13.920
confused here, and it's probably two separate traditions that have been fused together in the

10:13.920 --> 10:20.640
Apocryphon of John, but from these it seems that 12 independent kings are pointed over the spheres

10:20.720 --> 10:25.440
of the heavens. These seven rulers are thus associated with the visible planets or the

10:25.440 --> 10:31.520
wandering stars of the geocentric world. These beings represent not only the spatial dimensions

10:31.520 --> 10:36.960
above us, but also the course of time itself, corresponding as the text says to the days of

10:36.960 --> 10:42.960
the week. We even learn a bit about their physical appearance, each having the face of various animals

10:42.960 --> 10:49.360
such as a sheep, a donkey, a hyena, even one of flaming fire. This is a feature that probably has

10:49.360 --> 10:54.320
its origins in traditional Egyptian religious iconography. It's typically the idea of human

10:54.320 --> 10:59.520
being like creatures having the heads of animals in religious depictions of gods. The demiurge,

10:59.520 --> 11:05.520
having created these rulers, then transferred some of his fire to them, perhaps activating them or

11:05.520 --> 11:11.120
emanating them at some level, such that they would believe he's, well, he's the only god,

11:11.120 --> 11:17.920
and in his equally ignorant and narcissistic declaration, I am god. There is no god aside

11:17.920 --> 11:23.440
from me, taken from the Genesis creation story. There's immediately issued a declaration which

11:23.440 --> 11:29.840
is basically a rebuttal by a voice from the upper supernal spiritual realm. In fact, Yaldavoth goes

11:29.840 --> 11:37.920
so far as to model his inverse realm of darkness and matter, our world, on the supernal realm,

11:37.920 --> 11:44.560
though often with satanic inversions mirroring the upper worlds. And from these, the archons would

11:44.640 --> 11:53.200
emerge 365 angels, though it would be better to think of them as demons for, well, for obvious

11:53.200 --> 11:59.760
reasons. Once the physical world or our cosmic prison was constructed, the demiurge decided,

11:59.760 --> 12:05.760
again, in an act of extreme narcissism to create a being in his own image. However,

12:05.760 --> 12:10.080
it apparently required the aid of the archon demons and thus Yaldavoth declared,

12:10.160 --> 12:17.360
let us, let us make human beings in our image. This is, by the way, the hermeneutical answer

12:17.360 --> 12:22.560
given by the Gnostics to that statement in Genesis that's in the plural, the radical plural, rather

12:22.560 --> 12:29.600
than the divine singular, which is anomalous. It's not the monarchic plural. It's literally a bunch

12:29.600 --> 12:35.360
of demons making human beings. The apocryphon of John infamously identifying the creator of the biblical

12:35.360 --> 12:43.120
Genesis story with the evil demiurge. But Yaldavoth, the archons are demons and they all set

12:43.120 --> 12:48.800
forth to create the primordial human being, each forging a specific anatomical feature,

12:48.800 --> 12:53.680
first the psychical features, the psychical elements of the body, and then the physical

12:53.680 --> 13:00.320
elements of the primordial human body, the Adam. Again, many of these names of the beings that

13:00.320 --> 13:04.960
construct our physical bodies and our psychical bodies are very obscure and I'll come back to

13:04.960 --> 13:10.560
them in just a moment. Following the creation of the 365 elements of the psychical body, remember

13:10.560 --> 13:15.680
there's 365 of these archons of some level, including this would include psychical states such

13:15.680 --> 13:22.000
as desires, emotions, fear, grief, the love of pleasure, etc. Well, the heavenly mother at that

13:22.000 --> 13:30.800
point took pity on the primordial Adam and breathed through Yaldavoth life into this psychical body,

13:30.880 --> 13:35.840
of course due to the ignorance of the archons, which are as malevolent as they are stupid,

13:35.840 --> 13:40.480
frankly. They didn't realize that by working together that they would create a psychical

13:40.480 --> 13:45.520
Adam that would be more powerful than all of them individually. The psychical Adam was

13:45.520 --> 13:51.120
constructed by all of them, therefore had all their powers with our powers combined. They

13:51.120 --> 13:57.200
just created a being that could best all of them. Further enlightened insight was cast down,

13:57.280 --> 14:03.200
put down, into from the spiritual realm, into the psychical body, giving human beings the ability

14:03.200 --> 14:08.640
to recognize at least the truth of their condition, something that the archons certainly couldn't do.

14:08.640 --> 14:15.200
Well, maybe with one exception. But realizing their mistake, the archons mixed together, earth,

14:15.200 --> 14:21.280
air, fire, and water, they mixed together hule, matter, and cast this psychical body into a

14:21.280 --> 14:27.360
prison of matter. This is our physical bodies and then put that physical body in a garden of

14:27.360 --> 14:34.240
delights, a garden of pleasure, a garden of Eden meant to intoxicate the Adam, therefore basically

14:34.800 --> 14:38.640
intoxicating him with pleasure such that he would never realize that his condition,

14:39.280 --> 14:44.640
nor realize his power, and therefore never realized that he could in fact escape.

14:45.600 --> 14:51.760
But all of this is crucially important for considering our condition for these Christians.

14:51.760 --> 14:56.640
Not only is our physical body a prison, a point well made in dualistic theories like this,

14:57.200 --> 15:03.760
but ultimately even our psychical body is a prison. What we think of as our mental and emotional life

15:03.760 --> 15:10.800
are all created by the archons for precisely keeping us in prison shackled within delusions

15:10.800 --> 15:16.320
and emotions, thus not only as our physical body a prison, but also the negative thoughts and emotions

15:16.320 --> 15:22.960
which blind us to things like rage and fear and jealousy and love of pleasure. In a sense,

15:22.960 --> 15:27.760
because we are created by the archons, our psychical and physical bodies are created by the

15:27.760 --> 15:35.200
archons, they've left a hideous imprint of themselves in our psyches. And in a sense,

15:35.200 --> 15:39.280
we're created like people possessed as our natural condition. We're like

15:40.160 --> 15:46.400
marionettes controlled by the archons. It's only through our enlightened insight which came to us

15:46.400 --> 15:52.160
from the spiritual realm and the dedication of us to our spiritual life, which Adam only recognized

15:52.160 --> 15:57.920
by the way in the creation of Eve, or Chava, life, that we have the ability and the means to transcend

15:57.920 --> 16:04.640
our otherwise condition of being a demonic puppet. In fact, the Apocalypse of John rejects the concept

16:04.640 --> 16:09.840
of Eve being merely a derivative of Adam. The text in fact notes that it was not from a rib,

16:09.840 --> 16:15.680
as Moses says, but Eve was actually made from the very image of enlightened insight that was found

16:15.680 --> 16:22.400
within Adam. Regardless, the primary role of the archons in this element of the mythology

16:22.400 --> 16:27.680
is to explain how our physical, and I think even more importantly, our psychical bodies,

16:27.680 --> 16:32.720
having their origin in the contorted horrors of the archons, the demons,

16:33.360 --> 16:39.440
set the primary condition for our entrapment in this prison cosmos.

16:40.240 --> 16:43.600
Now, the elaborate mythologies of these texts are at face value.

16:44.720 --> 16:48.960
They're pretty wild. I mean, Irenaeus just thought he could convince you that they're not true by

16:48.960 --> 16:54.160
distilling you what the Gnostics believe. And further, they're very much beyond the pale

16:54.240 --> 16:58.400
of virtually any such narrative about the human condition and antiquity. I mean,

16:59.040 --> 17:05.040
everyone admitted the world wasn't perfect, sure, but that this was all literally created by demons

17:05.040 --> 17:10.640
as a prison? That was a bit much, frankly. An adherence of this spirituality clearly felt the

17:10.640 --> 17:16.480
need to defend this idea both by appealing to widely accepted Christian scriptures and by

17:16.480 --> 17:21.840
greatly clarifying the nature of these various myths. I mean, you could just add more detail to

17:21.840 --> 17:27.600
make it even stranger and somehow that made it more believable. And that's precisely what we

17:27.600 --> 17:32.960
find in an important text found in the fourth tractate of the second Nagamadi codex, a text

17:32.960 --> 17:38.480
variously known as the hypothesis of the archons or the reality of the rulers or the nature of the

17:38.480 --> 17:43.200
archons. There's a lot of ways of translating this depending on how you want to deal with the

17:43.200 --> 17:50.880
technical term, hupustasis in Greek. It's, well, it's technical. In this text, the author seems

17:50.880 --> 17:56.240
to be welding together two previous documents in order to show that the archons are one, very

17:56.240 --> 18:01.840
much real, and two, they must be vanquished. And he does this by introducing the text with a paraphrase

18:01.840 --> 18:07.200
of the very famous quotation of Colossians 1.3, allegedly written by Paul, that the followers

18:07.200 --> 18:12.720
of Christ do not struggle against the flesh, but against the authorities, the archons of the world,

18:12.720 --> 18:19.040
and the spirits of wickedness. In fact, other Pauline or school of Paul texts even hint that

18:19.040 --> 18:25.280
these beings live in the sky, Ephesians 3.10 and 6.12. And over at Colossians 2.8 and 2.20,

18:25.280 --> 18:32.080
it even refers to them as elemental spirits of the universe, thus linking them at some level,

18:32.080 --> 18:37.120
perhaps, with this vile materiality, at least in the minds of the Gnostics. Thus, the text is meant

18:37.120 --> 18:42.640
to outline the reality and nature of the archons. In this text, the reality of the rulers, we learn

18:42.640 --> 18:48.240
that the archons are androgyne. In fact, Yaldabaoth is also androgyne, and they have the faces of the

18:48.240 --> 18:54.960
beasts, as we noted earlier, and that they literally huffed and puffed in a failed attempt to raise

18:54.960 --> 19:02.480
the primordial, atomic body to life. All to no avail, they couldn't bring him to life. Only

19:02.480 --> 19:08.720
when the supernal breath flowed into him could he be animated. Again, you get the sense that the

19:08.720 --> 19:16.880
archons are pretty stupid. But not only stupid, they're hideously rapacious, and this text,

19:16.880 --> 19:22.080
like others, the archons immediately attempt to pounce on Eve to assault her once they've created

19:22.080 --> 19:27.440
her. However, again, their stupidity is their downfall. She outwits them, and she turns herself

19:27.440 --> 19:33.440
into a tree, perhaps an echo of the Daphne legend in Greek mythology. But the archons being horrible

19:33.440 --> 19:41.440
go on to assault the mere shadow that she had left behind, again, their vileness only being matched by

19:41.520 --> 19:47.680
their idiocy. Indeed, the rapacious fervor of the archons would emerge again and again when they

19:47.680 --> 19:53.040
attempted to assault Norea, the daughter of Adam and Eve, a crucially important character in these

19:53.040 --> 19:58.720
mis-systems. In fact, Norea, she gets her own episode. She's really, really important. Her whole

19:58.720 --> 20:05.120
book's dedicated to Norea. The demonic archons threaten Norea, demanding that she submit to them

20:05.120 --> 20:11.760
sexually as Eve had done, at least as they claim Eve had done. However, Norea actually knew the

20:11.760 --> 20:17.280
truth that Eve hadn't submitted to them. She knew that she tricked them, and having special insight,

20:17.280 --> 20:23.760
she cried out to the upper spiritual realms, and taking pity on her, the angelic being Eleth descends,

20:24.320 --> 20:28.160
driving away the archons, and the rest of the text takes the form of a kind of

20:29.200 --> 20:33.200
something like an early Gnostic catechism. In fact, some scholars believe it was a literal

20:33.200 --> 20:38.480
read out loud catechistic text with Norea interrogating Eleth about the true nature of

20:38.480 --> 20:42.960
reality, and much of the details repeated there are actually found in others at the

20:42.960 --> 20:49.280
end text, especially texts like the Apocryphon of John, though there is a really important,

20:49.280 --> 20:55.520
relatively novel account concerning one archon, Sabaoth. Remember when I said that Yael the

20:55.520 --> 21:02.880
Baoth declared that it was the only god only to be shided from a voice from above? That shiding

21:02.880 --> 21:09.120
was actually done by the angelic power of life, Zoe, the daughter of faith wisdom, or Pistis Sophia,

21:09.120 --> 21:17.200
who has her own very complicated book. Well, in this text, the archon Sabaoth actually sees this

21:17.200 --> 21:22.960
moment. He's high enough up in the emanations that he sees Zoe rebuke, so Yael the Baoth, and

21:22.960 --> 21:29.520
Zoe's breath becomes a fire in the face of Yael the Baoth, and she casts him it down into the

21:29.520 --> 21:35.440
bottom of the abyss and to Tartarus. The archon Sabaoth realizes Yael the Baoth is a liar, he

21:35.440 --> 21:40.640
rejects the divinity of Yael the Baoth, and rather he sends his prayers to the supernal realm,

21:40.640 --> 21:47.200
and in reward for that is actually elevated to the highest station he can be in this cosmic prison.

21:47.200 --> 21:52.640
He gets to go up to the eighth heaven, nearest to the divine fullness or pluroma, and he creates

21:52.640 --> 21:58.240
for himself the Ezekiel style chariot throne we typically associate with Yael. Thus the quasi

21:58.240 --> 22:03.840
beneficent archon Sabaoth is ultimately flanked by Zoe, or the supernal life, and is given control

22:03.840 --> 22:10.320
over an angel of wrath, and then given rulership over this entire cosmic realm, thus lessening,

22:11.280 --> 22:16.960
at least to some degree the more extreme dualism associated with this mythology. As for Yael the

22:16.960 --> 22:22.320
Baoth, of course he rages in envy, Sabaoth is given all this power, and that envy gives birth

22:22.320 --> 22:29.760
to death, and that death pollutes our entire cosmic realm. Numerous other versions of this

22:29.760 --> 22:34.640
archontic mythology exist in various forms of ancient Christian literature. One of the more

22:34.640 --> 22:40.240
fascinating is a partially preserved by Origen in his polemic against Celsus. Here we find details

22:40.240 --> 22:45.600
from a sect typically referred to as the Ophites, from the word snake who apparently admired the

22:45.600 --> 22:51.760
wisdom bequeathing snake of the Garden of Eden, who the archons sought to destroy. In their mythology

22:51.760 --> 22:56.080
the snake really revealed to us all the wisdom, and the archons tried to get rid of him. And what

22:56.080 --> 23:01.680
has come down to us as the Ophite diagram, we have what seems to have been a kind of esoteric

23:01.680 --> 23:07.760
geometric representation or diagram of reality, from the supernal realms all the way down to the

23:07.760 --> 23:13.440
infernal realms, with a series of seven archons which may have been generations of Yael the Baoth,

23:13.440 --> 23:19.200
sort of Yael the Baoth emanating itself, though again the text isn't clear, in fact there are

23:19.200 --> 23:24.240
two different layers of the text and it's preserved by Origen. But interestingly enough here the

23:24.240 --> 23:29.520
archons actually include classic archangels, again with beastly heads, though one of them is clearly

23:29.520 --> 23:35.600
a corrupt version of the Hebrew Tohu Vovohu, the primordial chaos out of which creation is drawn

23:35.600 --> 23:41.520
there in the first creation story. Interestingly also, the entire system is actually bounded at

23:41.520 --> 23:47.600
two levels by Leviathan and Behemoth as something like world souls for the psychical and material

23:47.600 --> 23:53.120
realms respectively. So here Leviathan and Behemoth play a role, though exactly what that

23:53.120 --> 23:59.040
role is isn't clear. Truth be told the exact nature of the Ophite diagram is debated, there are

23:59.040 --> 24:03.280
lots of different representations, and this is probably just a good idea to say this will be a

24:03.280 --> 24:08.880
future episode. Another very important text is the incredibly learned, brilliant text on the

24:08.880 --> 24:13.920
origin of the world found just after reality of the rulers in the Nagamani library, and it also

24:13.920 --> 24:19.360
contains a list of archons which the text refers to as the Seven Powers of the Heavens of Chaos.

24:21.600 --> 24:27.600
Band name alert. At any rate, three of these, Yael and Aloai and Ostafaios, are actually denoted as

24:27.600 --> 24:35.040
directly sons of Yael de Baoth. Also good band name. This wonderful text, one of my favorites

24:35.040 --> 24:39.920
actually from the Nagamani library, details how the other archons actually went to war against the

24:39.920 --> 24:45.200
righteous Archon Sabahoth, and in triumph he would go on to create the Seraphim, the angels that

24:45.200 --> 24:52.320
rotate around the throne saying holy holy holy, to celebrate Sabahoth and eventually he's responsible

24:52.320 --> 25:01.120
for creating Jesus. Sabahoth in this myth creates Jesus Christ himself, thus at least in this myth

25:01.120 --> 25:06.720
cycle the rebel Archon Sabahoth who creates Jesus, he's empowered from above and would eventually

25:06.720 --> 25:12.320
be sent into our realm to teach the path of redemption, thus in a very important sense.

25:13.280 --> 25:19.120
It's actually an Archon, a redeemed Archon, but an Archon that ultimately provides the path

25:19.680 --> 25:24.960
to salvation via the teachings of Christ. In fact salvation, it isn't clear that Sabahoth

25:24.960 --> 25:31.760
himself even has access to. He might not be able to escape this realm, somehow making him all the

25:31.840 --> 25:37.920
more noble. Sabahoth really is the MVP of this system. And even though it's not directly related

25:37.920 --> 25:43.680
to this whole Archon business, if you're a fan of Thunder Perfect Mine, and if you're not a fan of

25:43.680 --> 25:48.400
Thunder Perfect Mine, you should just unsubscribe and go somewhere else. You absolutely have to read

25:48.400 --> 25:52.880
On the Origin of the World. There's a surprise in there related to Thunder. I won't ruin what it is,

25:54.320 --> 25:59.280
but there's an Easter Egg, a Thunder Perfect Mine Easter Egg in On the Origins of the World.

26:00.160 --> 26:05.280
Other texts, like the Mammoth, Pistis Sophia seem to have only five Archons, but they do

26:05.280 --> 26:10.960
include Hecate and Typhon, interestingly enough. And later, Polymical Text also detail various

26:10.960 --> 26:16.320
Archons as they occur in different kinds of sects of Gnosticism. The most comprehensive of those

26:16.320 --> 26:23.040
can be found in texts like the Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis, which is a positively fascinating

26:23.040 --> 26:29.920
collection of anti-heresy texts. In fact, the Panarion even details a rather late surviving

26:29.920 --> 26:34.720
sect in the fourth century that he denotes for their belief, precisely for their belief in the

26:34.720 --> 26:39.760
Archons. He refers to them as the Archontics. It may have been the case that the belief in the

26:39.760 --> 26:45.520
Archons had simply become scarce by the fourth century, though it seems that the text notes

26:45.520 --> 26:50.400
that it was taught by a certain man named Peter near what is now modern-day Chavron. But we have

26:50.400 --> 26:55.600
there an interesting story where this monk-like Gnostic character, Peter, converts a traveling

26:55.600 --> 27:02.080
Armenian Christian named Utaktos. Epiphanius makes one of his names constantly, but Utaktos goes on

27:02.080 --> 27:07.280
to respread belief in the Archons through the region of Armenia and Palestine, perhaps making

27:07.280 --> 27:13.040
for a renaissance in this belief before its basic final disappearance from history, with the exception

27:13.040 --> 27:19.120
of the Bogomils, the Cathars, and the Mandeans. This curious section of the text allegedly provides,

27:19.200 --> 27:23.600
and again, you should trust Epiphanius as far as you can see him. In fact, some of the scriptures

27:23.600 --> 27:28.800
that the Archontics use, we have a text called the Greater and Lesser Harmonies, the Elogenes,

27:28.800 --> 27:33.200
which might actually survive in the Nagamadi Library, and also they seem to have employed

27:33.200 --> 27:37.920
the ascension of Isaiah, a pretty popular text in early Christianity, and one that over time

27:37.920 --> 27:42.480
will become later associated with the Bogomils and eventually the Cathars. If you're interested

27:42.480 --> 27:47.760
in the Cathars, I have several episodes about them and whether or not they really existed.

27:48.320 --> 27:52.240
Some of their teachings on the nature of the Archons, especially interesting in that they

27:52.240 --> 27:56.880
argued that the eighth highest heaven was again headed by Sabaoth, something we've seen on the

27:56.880 --> 28:02.080
origin of the world, and that they had a lower seven tiered heaven just below that, though in

28:02.080 --> 28:08.640
their system, Satan is actually created by Sabaoth, who is in turn giving rulership over this world,

28:08.640 --> 28:13.120
the physical world Satan dominates it for now. Again, this is an interesting inversion of the

28:13.120 --> 28:18.480
begetting relationships of these Gnostic mythologies, and the other mythology Yaldabaoth generates

28:18.480 --> 28:24.960
Sabaoth, who supplants him here for the Archontics, it's the other way around. The Archontics also

28:24.960 --> 28:28.800
rejected sacraments, including baptism, because they were all performed in the name of the false

28:28.800 --> 28:33.760
god Sabaoth, even though he's the highest one of this realm, he's still fake. Further, by rejecting

28:33.760 --> 28:38.400
the sacraments in the laws of this world, their souls began to make the ascent. It's by rejecting

28:38.400 --> 28:44.240
the sacraments of the Catholic Church, they start their ascent up, making defensive speeches before

28:44.240 --> 28:50.240
each Archon, before finally arriving back at the mother of the Pluroma. This is perhaps Sophia,

28:50.240 --> 28:55.280
wisdom, you get back to be with Sophia. Of course, there's a great deal more of interest in this

28:55.280 --> 29:00.880
sect, and you can read about it in the Panarion. Whose name, by the way, Panarion means bread basket,

29:00.880 --> 29:06.960
so this text always gave me like olive garden vibes. Regardless, this is just a must read text

29:06.960 --> 29:11.760
for anyone interested in Gnosticism. Even if you're sympathetic Gnosticism, you can often read

29:11.760 --> 29:17.120
these heresiological literature like Irenaeus or Hippolytus, and you get so much wonderful

29:17.120 --> 29:21.760
information that it's very much worth reading. In fact, I've done a very long episode on Irenaeus,

29:21.760 --> 29:26.800
one of the earliest sort of anti-Gnostic heresiologists, and you may want to check it out.

29:26.800 --> 29:30.480
It's one of my favorite episodes I've made about Gnosticism on the channel.

29:31.120 --> 29:35.680
Now, any reader of these texts, especially Pistis Sophia and the Apocryphon of John,

29:35.680 --> 29:41.120
will face a significant degree of bewilderment at some of the names of the Archons, or their

29:41.120 --> 29:48.080
attending angels, demons. So the natural question is just the origins of both the system of Archons,

29:48.080 --> 29:54.480
and why do they have these bizarre names? Why are they named this? The origin question,

29:54.480 --> 30:00.720
while not ever going to be definitively answered, is probably likely maybe that it was common in

30:00.720 --> 30:05.440
the ancient world to attach angels, demons, and daimons to the various celestial regions and

30:05.520 --> 30:09.440
antiquity, and the various celestial objects in antiquity. In fact, this would continue well

30:09.440 --> 30:15.120
under the Middle Ages with angels basically moving planets around as their efficient causation,

30:15.120 --> 30:19.520
and even with magical texts like the Arbital with its various system of invocation of planetary

30:19.520 --> 30:25.760
spirits. Thus, the 12-fold division followed by a 7-fold division followed then by a 365-fold

30:25.760 --> 30:31.360
division, which is found again on the Apocryphon of John. Well, it just nicely captures the circular

30:31.360 --> 30:36.880
dome of the zodiac as the outermost sphere of the geocentric cosmos, in which the moon and the sun

30:36.880 --> 30:43.360
and the five classical wandering stars, the planets, move about followed by 365 days of the

30:43.360 --> 30:50.080
solar year. Thus, insofar as the Archons are at the origin and control the fate of the material and

30:51.120 --> 30:56.080
psychical cosmos, including our physical and psychical bodies, they would go from the fixed

30:56.080 --> 31:00.800
stars at the very limit to the very outer edge to the wandering stars down to the days of the year.

31:00.880 --> 31:05.040
This all gives them power over both the physical cosmos of space,

31:05.040 --> 31:11.680
but also the processional cosmos of time. It's basically the demonization of the

31:11.680 --> 31:18.240
attending beings at work in the cosmos of antiquity. If you take those and just make them all evil,

31:18.240 --> 31:25.440
well, they go from being angels and diamonds to being archons. Now, the more difficult issue

31:25.440 --> 31:30.800
is the often bewildering names given to these beings. Now, many of them are clearly derived

31:30.800 --> 31:36.240
from Hebrew Aramaic divine names, which are then transposed and corrupted into Greek and Comptic.

31:36.240 --> 31:41.040
These are sometimes traditional angelic names, which simply undergo demonization. A great many

31:41.040 --> 31:48.000
of the others, frankly, are perplexing in origin. This is especially true for names like Yaldabaoth,

31:48.000 --> 31:52.800
although there's some guessing that this is maybe Aramaic or Hebrew for the child of chaos or the

31:52.880 --> 31:59.440
begetter of chaos, the maternal spirit Barbello, which again has a kind of Aramaic feel to it,

31:59.440 --> 32:04.160
and the host of archons and angel demons found especially in the names of the beings responsible

32:04.160 --> 32:09.760
for the construction of the primordial, Adamical body in the Apocryphon of John, or the profusion

32:09.760 --> 32:14.160
of entities that populate the treasuries of the books of you and the pistis Sophia among

32:15.280 --> 32:20.960
a great many other Gnostic texts. But the situation here isn't totally hopeless. We're not totally

32:20.960 --> 32:25.040
hopeless in terms of finding out where these names may have come from. Interestingly enough,

32:25.040 --> 32:29.920
some of these obscure names are actually found not just in Gnostic literature, but they're also

32:29.920 --> 32:35.200
found in the great archangian collection known to us as the Greek Magical Papyri. In a really

32:35.200 --> 32:41.120
fascinating article, the classicist Howard Jackson locates numerous instances in which many of these

32:41.120 --> 32:48.320
archontic names are also found in a wide range of magical uses, such as Incantations, Nomina

32:48.320 --> 32:53.280
Barbara, which is very important here, and sigil-like uses in the Greek Magical Papyri.

32:53.280 --> 32:58.800
I agree, I think, with his assessment that either the two bodies of literature of Gnostic and Magical

32:58.800 --> 33:03.200
share a common ancestor, that is to say, perhaps they go back to something like the Indigenous

33:03.200 --> 33:07.920
or Egyptian ritual technology, and there's clearly definitely Egyptian words in some of this,

33:08.560 --> 33:13.280
and I think one that's slightly more likely is that the Gnostic texts are actually lifting many

33:13.280 --> 33:18.960
of these archontic names from the Magical literature in the Egyptian context in which these texts,

33:18.960 --> 33:26.720
the Gnostic texts, were being composed. Thus, we might very well have a kind of magic to Gnosticism

33:26.720 --> 33:32.320
pipeline in the ancient world, and that even might give us a glimpse into the milieu of the

33:32.320 --> 33:39.680
authors that generated these Gnostic texts. In fact, this is all more, all the more reinforced,

33:39.680 --> 33:44.720
given the definite similarities between the rare instances of Gnostic ritual life,

33:44.720 --> 33:49.280
especially something like the complex baptism rituals to be found in texts like The Books of

33:49.280 --> 33:54.960
You, which I've made a whole episode about those, and the wider range of Greco-Egyptian magic.

33:54.960 --> 34:00.000
There's just no way that those baptism rituals, which are found in books like The Gnostic Book of

34:00.000 --> 34:04.880
You and the magical technologies found in the Greek Magical Papyri, are just not related,

34:05.440 --> 34:11.120
simply not happening. So what I suspect occurred, and again, we'll never know, was a theological

34:11.120 --> 34:16.080
shift very much like the one described quite wonderfully, actually, in M. David Litwas in

34:16.080 --> 34:21.600
his book The Evil Creator, which you absolutely should read, in which the Israelite God is somehow

34:21.600 --> 34:27.680
demonized, and then a two-step process by which the angels' daimons responsible for the movements

34:27.680 --> 34:34.560
and processes of the cosmos in the Judeo-Hellenistic worldview of the time were themselves, in turn,

34:34.560 --> 34:40.880
demonized in sets of 12, 7, and 365, though again, the texts aren't terribly systematic,

34:40.880 --> 34:46.720
nor uniform, frankly, though I do think that a set of seven archons seems to have been the

34:46.720 --> 34:52.640
standard among this literature. And finally, these archontic beings, they receive their names

34:52.640 --> 34:57.600
largely derived from Jewish and Greco-Egyptian sources, often traditional Jewish scriptures,

34:57.600 --> 35:03.760
but also especially the complex world of Greco-Egyptian magic. Of course, this theory does not,

35:03.840 --> 35:09.520
by any means, eliminate all the mysteries of the origins and nature of the archons. In fact,

35:10.160 --> 35:14.240
this would be an excellent application of something like AI, along with a database of

35:14.240 --> 35:20.800
ancient spirit, daimons, archons, nomina, Barbara, etc., as envisioned by Dr. Kristin Switzer,

35:20.800 --> 35:25.280
who I really hope it's a funding to make just that database. You can find out more about her

35:25.280 --> 35:30.320
in the description. By the way, if you're interested in ancient magic, you absolutely have to check

35:30.320 --> 35:36.000
out her channel, Dr. Switzer. It's one of the best resources out there on just that topic.

35:36.000 --> 35:41.520
At any rate, while the evil demiurge Yael the Baoth often, well, frankly steals the show,

35:41.520 --> 35:46.560
perhaps because of our love for anything with a flair for the Lovecraftian, I hope I've shown

35:46.560 --> 35:54.640
that the archons also play a decisively important role, even a surprising role in this wonderfully

35:54.720 --> 36:01.840
weird mythology. I mean, you hardly ever hear about the renegade archon responsible for recreating

36:01.840 --> 36:06.720
Jesus, or the connections of the archons with Greco-Egyptian magic more generally.

36:07.360 --> 36:14.000
In these ways, among many others, their role is often downplayed, it's often overshadowed because

36:14.000 --> 36:20.160
we love talking about the evil demiurge, and I think that's a mistake if you want to really

36:20.160 --> 36:26.240
robustly understand these mythologies. As usual, I've included a collection of resources if you

36:26.240 --> 36:30.560
want to really dive into Gnosticism in the description. Again, also check out my playlist

36:30.560 --> 36:37.840
on Gnosticism to really go through a bunch of these texts. But until next time, keep resisting

36:37.840 --> 36:44.960
those archontic, psychical impulses and ascend into the subvernal realms. Of course, also thanks

36:44.960 --> 36:52.160
for watching Esoterica, where we explore the arcane in history, philosophy and religion.
