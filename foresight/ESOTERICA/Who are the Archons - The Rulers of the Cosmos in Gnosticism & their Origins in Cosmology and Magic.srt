1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Perhaps one of the most scandalous tenets of some schools of ancient Christianity is

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:12,600
that the cosmos around us is inherently evil, forged by a psychopathic demiurge and ruled

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,320
over by a host of planetary demons bent on nothing less than the torture and enslavement

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,800
of the divine spark hidden within each human being.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,040
The origin and nature of those rulers are archons and ancient Greek remains one of the

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,480
more obscure issues in this quite honestly provocative theology.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,600
But the discovery of a wealth of ancient magical texts and a small library from Egypt has shed

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,480
more light on the very beings these Christians felt must be finally defeated and surpassed

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,560
as the soul escaped our cosmic prison.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,520
In this episode I want to explore what we know about the archons, their origins in

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,160
Greco-Egyptian cosmology and magic and how ancient Christians, though now known often

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,680
as Gnostic so problematically, thought they could soar beyond the terrible clutches of

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,560
these beings.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,000

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:56,760
But now let's explore the wardens, the prison guards of our cosmic cell, our cosmic prison,

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,200
the archons of ancient Gnosticism.

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:08,960
I'm Justin Sledge and welcome to Esoterica where we explore the arcane in history, philosophy,

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,480
and religion.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:37,400
The world of the second and especially the third centuries of the common era was a world

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,040
increasingly coming apart, a world tearing itself apart at the seams, especially from

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,120
within the traditional perspective of ancient Egypt, it was something of an apocalypse,

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,320
it was really the end of the world of ancient Egypt.

30
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,840
Centuries of Hellenistic hegemony, Roman conquest, along with widespread economic and political

31
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,280
stability made for a world very much worth escaping.

32
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,120
And a great many schools of theological, spiritual, and philosophical escapism, frankly, emerged.

33
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,520
The inward turn of stoicism as a coping philosophy, the mystical ascent spiritualities of Jewish

34
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:21,480
Merkava and Hermetic philosophies, and the afterlife oriented anti-worldly redemption

35
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:30,080
offered by the Christianities made for a veritable menu of technologies for just that

36
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,880
cosmic escape.

37
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,560
Perhaps none was more radical, none more extreme than the early species of Christianity that

38
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
have come down to be known as Gnosticism.

39
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,640
Now to be frank, I just don't have time to do a deep dive into the incredibly complex

40
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,160
mythologies of the Sethians and the Valentinians and the Ophites and the Basilideanians or

41
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,680
the Canites, though I've done episodes on many of those and they are probably worth

42
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,120
watching, especially the episode on the Apocryphal John and the section on the Valentinian Christianity.

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,280
Those are going to be really important connective tissues to get an idea of what's going on

44
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
in this video.

45
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,400
In fact, I have a whole Gnosticism playlist you can check out if you're interested in

46
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,680
really going deep on the Gnostic train, but the central thrust shared by many of these

47
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,360
theologies is that the true reality is a spiritual reality, not this.

48
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,720
It's a spiritual reality presided over by an ineffable deity whose outflowing, whose

49
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,040
emanations generated a host of beings known as the fullness or the pluroma in Greek.

50
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,880
However, one such entity, Sophia, or wisdom, sought to create on her own without the consent

51
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,240
of the great invisible spirit.

52
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:49,400
This mistake created a horrifying being, a nightmarish creature known variously as Sacklas,

53
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,840
Samael, Yaldabaoth, or the Demiurge.

54
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,760
Unlike Platonism, Stoicism, Judaism, or other species of Christianity, for whom the creator

55
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,000
of this world was a benevolent deity who created a maximally beautiful world, a maximally

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,680
good world, these Christians held that the physical cosmos was a kind of prison, ruled

57
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,680
over by that hideous Demiurge, the craftsperson, along with a retinue of malevolent beings

58
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,000
known as the rulers, or archons, in ancient Greek.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,960
In this myth, the upper spiritual realm ultimately takes pity on us, the poor human beings,

60
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:39,240
and smuggles within them a divine spiritual spark, and ultimately sends Christ, Jesus,

61
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,040
who reveals the truth about our cosmos and the means by which to escape it, and, of course,

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,200
to return with him, finally, to that divine light.

63
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,680
Of course I'm greatly simplifying the mythology there is an enormous amount of variation both

64
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,920
in these schools of thought and between them, frankly there's not just one Gnosticism,

65
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,680
but in a structural sense the core myth system remains remarkably consistent.

66
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,160
There's an effable spiritual reality in which a metaphysical tragedy occurs engendering the

67
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,200
creation of the malevolent Demiurge, which in turn creates the physical reality around

68
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,000
us, the physical cosmos, in which divine elements are trapped or encased within human beings,

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,920
and we as human beings have to escape this world.

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,520
In this episode, however, I want to focus in on one element, just one element of this

71
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:37,800
mythology, the origins and nature of the cosmic prism wardens as it were, the archons.

72
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,240
Now of course I'll be coming back to do another episode on the origins of the most shocking

73
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,840
element in all of this, the origins and nature of the evil creator, or the Demiurge, Saclas,

74
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,720
Samael, Yaldabaoth, but the archons turn out to be a crucially important element in this

75
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:01,160
mythology because in a very important sense they have created this physical prism, including

76
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,800
our bodies in which we are trapped and deluded into believing this is all real, they are

77
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,920
responsible for tricking us into believing that any of this is real, and even our thoughts

78
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,920
and emotions are just inner puppetry to control us, and that these entities must be ultimately

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,440
defeated and bypassed in our final jailbreak back to the spiritual world of light, beauty,

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,960
and oneness.

81
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,760
So what do we really know about the archons?

82
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,200
The term archon would have struck ancient years as powerfully political, though without

83
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,480
much of the majesty or any association with royalty, I think that's important, thus

84
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,640
a Latin equivalent might be magistrate or governor, they're basically political functionaries

85
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,880
who have ruled locally but not totally, and if you've ever worked in retail, they're

86
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:01,080
like the assistant manager with a chip on their shoulder who get off on making your life miserable

87
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,800
because they got picked on when they were little, they need therapy, not managerial positions.

88
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,440
Most of what we know about the archons can be found spread through the literature written

89
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,880
by the so-called Gnostic Christians themselves, and the polemics against some written by other

90
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,720
Christians such as Irenaeus, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius.

91
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,920
As I've mentioned earlier, in most of these mythological systems, these are beings created

92
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:31,800
or somehow generated by the malevolent divvijurge, both for its own narcissistic needs, but also

93
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:39,360
to act as secondary creators and enforcers of this physical prison cosmos.

94
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,320
In an important sense, they are the beings most intimately responsible for this whole mess,

95
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,280
and also they are the first major hurdle that one faces in one's escape back to the realm of

96
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:58,080
spiritual fullness, so I hope you could understand that knowing a bit about them seems germane to

97
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,680
making just that escape. Many, if not most, of the Gnostic creation myths contain some mention

98
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,680
of the archons, though the details on them vary greatly from text to text. Perhaps the most

99
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,720
instructive and popular narrative is represented by the Apocryphon of John, or the secret teachings

100
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,880
of John. Following the ignorant and mistaken creation of Yaldabaoth, the divvijurge with

101
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,200
the hideous body of a snake in the head of a lion, its eyes flashing as if bolts of lightning,

102
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,320
that being Yaldabaoth mates with itself, it mates with the mindlessness within itself,

103
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,640
to produce a series of 12 fiery beings. The names of many of these beings have their origins in

104
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,360
Jewish mythology, while others are more mysterious. Very strange, I'll come back to those in just

105
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,440
a minute toward the end of the episode. The first series of 12 archons probably represents the

106
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:04,080
creation of the zodiac, and thus the fixed dome of the cosmic system. This is sort of the

107
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,160
background of everything. Now, from among these, and separately, are extracted. Again, the text is

108
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,920
confused here, and it's probably two separate traditions that have been fused together in the

109
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,640
Apocryphon of John, but from these it seems that 12 independent kings are pointed over the spheres

110
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,440
of the heavens. These seven rulers are thus associated with the visible planets or the

111
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,520
wandering stars of the geocentric world. These beings represent not only the spatial dimensions

112
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,960
above us, but also the course of time itself, corresponding as the text says to the days of

113
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,960
the week. We even learn a bit about their physical appearance, each having the face of various animals

114
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:49,360
such as a sheep, a donkey, a hyena, even one of flaming fire. This is a feature that probably has

115
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,320
its origins in traditional Egyptian religious iconography. It's typically the idea of human

116
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,520
being like creatures having the heads of animals in religious depictions of gods. The demiurge,

117
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,520
having created these rulers, then transferred some of his fire to them, perhaps activating them or

118
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,120
emanating them at some level, such that they would believe he's, well, he's the only god,

119
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,920
and in his equally ignorant and narcissistic declaration, I am god. There is no god aside

120
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,440
from me, taken from the Genesis creation story. There's immediately issued a declaration which

121
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,840
is basically a rebuttal by a voice from the upper supernal spiritual realm. In fact, Yaldavoth goes

122
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:37,920
so far as to model his inverse realm of darkness and matter, our world, on the supernal realm,

123
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,560
though often with satanic inversions mirroring the upper worlds. And from these, the archons would

124
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:53,200
emerge 365 angels, though it would be better to think of them as demons for, well, for obvious

125
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,760
reasons. Once the physical world or our cosmic prison was constructed, the demiurge decided,

126
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,760
again, in an act of extreme narcissism to create a being in his own image. However,

127
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,080
it apparently required the aid of the archon demons and thus Yaldavoth declared,

128
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,360
let us, let us make human beings in our image. This is, by the way, the hermeneutical answer

129
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,560
given by the Gnostics to that statement in Genesis that's in the plural, the radical plural, rather

130
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,600
than the divine singular, which is anomalous. It's not the monarchic plural. It's literally a bunch

131
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,360
of demons making human beings. The apocryphon of John infamously identifying the creator of the biblical

132
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:43,120
Genesis story with the evil demiurge. But Yaldavoth, the archons are demons and they all set

133
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,800
forth to create the primordial human being, each forging a specific anatomical feature,

134
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,680
first the psychical features, the psychical elements of the body, and then the physical

135
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,320
elements of the primordial human body, the Adam. Again, many of these names of the beings that

136
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,960
construct our physical bodies and our psychical bodies are very obscure and I'll come back to

137
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,560
them in just a moment. Following the creation of the 365 elements of the psychical body, remember

138
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,680
there's 365 of these archons of some level, including this would include psychical states such

139
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,000
as desires, emotions, fear, grief, the love of pleasure, etc. Well, the heavenly mother at that

140
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,800
point took pity on the primordial Adam and breathed through Yaldavoth life into this psychical body,

141
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,840
of course due to the ignorance of the archons, which are as malevolent as they are stupid,

142
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,480
frankly. They didn't realize that by working together that they would create a psychical

143
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,520
Adam that would be more powerful than all of them individually. The psychical Adam was

144
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,120
constructed by all of them, therefore had all their powers with our powers combined. They

145
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,200
just created a being that could best all of them. Further enlightened insight was cast down,

146
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,200
put down, into from the spiritual realm, into the psychical body, giving human beings the ability

147
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,640
to recognize at least the truth of their condition, something that the archons certainly couldn't do.

148
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:15,200
Well, maybe with one exception. But realizing their mistake, the archons mixed together, earth,

149
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,280
air, fire, and water, they mixed together hule, matter, and cast this psychical body into a

150
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:27,360
prison of matter. This is our physical bodies and then put that physical body in a garden of

151
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,240
delights, a garden of pleasure, a garden of Eden meant to intoxicate the Adam, therefore basically

152
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,640
intoxicating him with pleasure such that he would never realize that his condition,

153
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,640
nor realize his power, and therefore never realized that he could in fact escape.

154
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,760
But all of this is crucially important for considering our condition for these Christians.

155
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,640
Not only is our physical body a prison, a point well made in dualistic theories like this,

156
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,760
but ultimately even our psychical body is a prison. What we think of as our mental and emotional life

157
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,800
are all created by the archons for precisely keeping us in prison shackled within delusions

158
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,320
and emotions, thus not only as our physical body a prison, but also the negative thoughts and emotions

159
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,960
which blind us to things like rage and fear and jealousy and love of pleasure. In a sense,

160
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,760
because we are created by the archons, our psychical and physical bodies are created by the

161
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:35,200
archons, they've left a hideous imprint of themselves in our psyches. And in a sense,

162
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,280
we're created like people possessed as our natural condition. We're like

163
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,400
marionettes controlled by the archons. It's only through our enlightened insight which came to us

164
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,160
from the spiritual realm and the dedication of us to our spiritual life, which Adam only recognized

165
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,920
by the way in the creation of Eve, or Chava, life, that we have the ability and the means to transcend

166
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,640
our otherwise condition of being a demonic puppet. In fact, the Apocalypse of John rejects the concept

167
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,840
of Eve being merely a derivative of Adam. The text in fact notes that it was not from a rib,

168
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,680
as Moses says, but Eve was actually made from the very image of enlightened insight that was found

169
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,400
within Adam. Regardless, the primary role of the archons in this element of the mythology

170
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,680
is to explain how our physical, and I think even more importantly, our psychical bodies,

171
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,720
having their origin in the contorted horrors of the archons, the demons,

172
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,440
set the primary condition for our entrapment in this prison cosmos.

173
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,600
Now, the elaborate mythologies of these texts are at face value.

174
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,960
They're pretty wild. I mean, Irenaeus just thought he could convince you that they're not true by

175
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,160
distilling you what the Gnostics believe. And further, they're very much beyond the pale

176
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,400
of virtually any such narrative about the human condition and antiquity. I mean,

177
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,040
everyone admitted the world wasn't perfect, sure, but that this was all literally created by demons

178
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,640
as a prison? That was a bit much, frankly. An adherence of this spirituality clearly felt the

179
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,480
need to defend this idea both by appealing to widely accepted Christian scriptures and by

180
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,840
greatly clarifying the nature of these various myths. I mean, you could just add more detail to

181
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,600
make it even stranger and somehow that made it more believable. And that's precisely what we

182
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,960
find in an important text found in the fourth tractate of the second Nagamadi codex, a text

183
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,480
variously known as the hypothesis of the archons or the reality of the rulers or the nature of the

184
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,200
archons. There's a lot of ways of translating this depending on how you want to deal with the

185
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,880
technical term, hupustasis in Greek. It's, well, it's technical. In this text, the author seems

186
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,240
to be welding together two previous documents in order to show that the archons are one, very

187
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,840
much real, and two, they must be vanquished. And he does this by introducing the text with a paraphrase

188
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,200
of the very famous quotation of Colossians 1.3, allegedly written by Paul, that the followers

189
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,720
of Christ do not struggle against the flesh, but against the authorities, the archons of the world,

190
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,040
and the spirits of wickedness. In fact, other Pauline or school of Paul texts even hint that

191
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,280
these beings live in the sky, Ephesians 3.10 and 6.12. And over at Colossians 2.8 and 2.20,

192
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,080
it even refers to them as elemental spirits of the universe, thus linking them at some level,

193
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,120
perhaps, with this vile materiality, at least in the minds of the Gnostics. Thus, the text is meant

194
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,640
to outline the reality and nature of the archons. In this text, the reality of the rulers, we learn

195
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,240
that the archons are androgyne. In fact, Yaldabaoth is also androgyne, and they have the faces of the

196
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,960
beasts, as we noted earlier, and that they literally huffed and puffed in a failed attempt to raise

197
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:02,480
the primordial, atomic body to life. All to no avail, they couldn't bring him to life. Only

198
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,720
when the supernal breath flowed into him could he be animated. Again, you get the sense that the

199
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:16,880
archons are pretty stupid. But not only stupid, they're hideously rapacious, and this text,

200
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,080
like others, the archons immediately attempt to pounce on Eve to assault her once they've created

201
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,440
her. However, again, their stupidity is their downfall. She outwits them, and she turns herself

202
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,440
into a tree, perhaps an echo of the Daphne legend in Greek mythology. But the archons being horrible

203
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:41,440
go on to assault the mere shadow that she had left behind, again, their vileness only being matched by

204
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,680
their idiocy. Indeed, the rapacious fervor of the archons would emerge again and again when they

205
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,040
attempted to assault Norea, the daughter of Adam and Eve, a crucially important character in these

206
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,720
mis-systems. In fact, Norea, she gets her own episode. She's really, really important. Her whole

207
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,120
book's dedicated to Norea. The demonic archons threaten Norea, demanding that she submit to them

208
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,760
sexually as Eve had done, at least as they claim Eve had done. However, Norea actually knew the

209
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,280
truth that Eve hadn't submitted to them. She knew that she tricked them, and having special insight,

210
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,760
she cried out to the upper spiritual realms, and taking pity on her, the angelic being Eleth descends,

211
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,160
driving away the archons, and the rest of the text takes the form of a kind of

212
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,200
something like an early Gnostic catechism. In fact, some scholars believe it was a literal

213
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,480
read out loud catechistic text with Norea interrogating Eleth about the true nature of

214
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,960
reality, and much of the details repeated there are actually found in others at the

215
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,280
end text, especially texts like the Apocryphon of John, though there is a really important,

216
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,520
relatively novel account concerning one archon, Sabaoth. Remember when I said that Yael the

217
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,880
Baoth declared that it was the only god only to be shided from a voice from above? That shiding

218
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,120
was actually done by the angelic power of life, Zoe, the daughter of faith wisdom, or Pistis Sophia,

219
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:17,200
who has her own very complicated book. Well, in this text, the archon Sabaoth actually sees this

220
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,960
moment. He's high enough up in the emanations that he sees Zoe rebuke, so Yael the Baoth, and

221
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,520
Zoe's breath becomes a fire in the face of Yael the Baoth, and she casts him it down into the

222
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,440
bottom of the abyss and to Tartarus. The archon Sabaoth realizes Yael the Baoth is a liar, he

223
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,640
rejects the divinity of Yael the Baoth, and rather he sends his prayers to the supernal realm,

224
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,200
and in reward for that is actually elevated to the highest station he can be in this cosmic prison.

225
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,640
He gets to go up to the eighth heaven, nearest to the divine fullness or pluroma, and he creates

226
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,240
for himself the Ezekiel style chariot throne we typically associate with Yael. Thus the quasi

227
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,840
beneficent archon Sabaoth is ultimately flanked by Zoe, or the supernal life, and is given control

228
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,320
over an angel of wrath, and then given rulership over this entire cosmic realm, thus lessening,

229
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,960
at least to some degree the more extreme dualism associated with this mythology. As for Yael the

230
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,320
Baoth, of course he rages in envy, Sabaoth is given all this power, and that envy gives birth

231
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:29,760
to death, and that death pollutes our entire cosmic realm. Numerous other versions of this

232
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,640
archontic mythology exist in various forms of ancient Christian literature. One of the more

233
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,240
fascinating is a partially preserved by Origen in his polemic against Celsus. Here we find details

234
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,600
from a sect typically referred to as the Ophites, from the word snake who apparently admired the

235
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,760
wisdom bequeathing snake of the Garden of Eden, who the archons sought to destroy. In their mythology

236
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,080
the snake really revealed to us all the wisdom, and the archons tried to get rid of him. And what

237
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,680
has come down to us as the Ophite diagram, we have what seems to have been a kind of esoteric

238
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,760
geometric representation or diagram of reality, from the supernal realms all the way down to the

239
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,440
infernal realms, with a series of seven archons which may have been generations of Yael the Baoth,

240
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,200
sort of Yael the Baoth emanating itself, though again the text isn't clear, in fact there are

241
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,240
two different layers of the text and it's preserved by Origen. But interestingly enough here the

242
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,520
archons actually include classic archangels, again with beastly heads, though one of them is clearly

243
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,600
a corrupt version of the Hebrew Tohu Vovohu, the primordial chaos out of which creation is drawn

244
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,520
there in the first creation story. Interestingly also, the entire system is actually bounded at

245
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,600
two levels by Leviathan and Behemoth as something like world souls for the psychical and material

246
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,120
realms respectively. So here Leviathan and Behemoth play a role, though exactly what that

247
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,040
role is isn't clear. Truth be told the exact nature of the Ophite diagram is debated, there are

248
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,280
lots of different representations, and this is probably just a good idea to say this will be a

249
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,880
future episode. Another very important text is the incredibly learned, brilliant text on the

250
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,920
origin of the world found just after reality of the rulers in the Nagamani library, and it also

251
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,360
contains a list of archons which the text refers to as the Seven Powers of the Heavens of Chaos.

252
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Band name alert. At any rate, three of these, Yael and Aloai and Ostafaios, are actually denoted as

253
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:35,040
directly sons of Yael de Baoth. Also good band name. This wonderful text, one of my favorites

254
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,920
actually from the Nagamani library, details how the other archons actually went to war against the

255
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,200
righteous Archon Sabahoth, and in triumph he would go on to create the Seraphim, the angels that

256
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,320
rotate around the throne saying holy holy holy, to celebrate Sabahoth and eventually he's responsible

257
00:24:52,320 --> 00:25:01,120
for creating Jesus. Sabahoth in this myth creates Jesus Christ himself, thus at least in this myth

258
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,720
cycle the rebel Archon Sabahoth who creates Jesus, he's empowered from above and would eventually

259
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,320
be sent into our realm to teach the path of redemption, thus in a very important sense.

260
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:19,120
It's actually an Archon, a redeemed Archon, but an Archon that ultimately provides the path

261
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,960
to salvation via the teachings of Christ. In fact salvation, it isn't clear that Sabahoth

262
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,760
himself even has access to. He might not be able to escape this realm, somehow making him all the

263
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,920
more noble. Sabahoth really is the MVP of this system. And even though it's not directly related

264
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,680
to this whole Archon business, if you're a fan of Thunder Perfect Mine, and if you're not a fan of

265
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,400
Thunder Perfect Mine, you should just unsubscribe and go somewhere else. You absolutely have to read

266
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,880
On the Origin of the World. There's a surprise in there related to Thunder. I won't ruin what it is,

267
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,280
but there's an Easter Egg, a Thunder Perfect Mine Easter Egg in On the Origins of the World.

268
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,280
Other texts, like the Mammoth, Pistis Sophia seem to have only five Archons, but they do

269
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,960
include Hecate and Typhon, interestingly enough. And later, Polymical Text also detail various

270
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,320
Archons as they occur in different kinds of sects of Gnosticism. The most comprehensive of those

271
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,040
can be found in texts like the Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis, which is a positively fascinating

272
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:29,920
collection of anti-heresy texts. In fact, the Panarion even details a rather late surviving

273
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,720
sect in the fourth century that he denotes for their belief, precisely for their belief in the

274
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,760
Archons. He refers to them as the Archontics. It may have been the case that the belief in the

275
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,520
Archons had simply become scarce by the fourth century, though it seems that the text notes

276
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,400
that it was taught by a certain man named Peter near what is now modern-day Chavron. But we have

277
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,600
there an interesting story where this monk-like Gnostic character, Peter, converts a traveling

278
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:02,080
Armenian Christian named Utaktos. Epiphanius makes one of his names constantly, but Utaktos goes on

279
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,280
to respread belief in the Archons through the region of Armenia and Palestine, perhaps making

280
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,040
for a renaissance in this belief before its basic final disappearance from history, with the exception

281
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:19,120
of the Bogomils, the Cathars, and the Mandeans. This curious section of the text allegedly provides,

282
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,600
and again, you should trust Epiphanius as far as you can see him. In fact, some of the scriptures

283
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,800
that the Archontics use, we have a text called the Greater and Lesser Harmonies, the Elogenes,

284
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,200
which might actually survive in the Nagamadi Library, and also they seem to have employed

285
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,920
the ascension of Isaiah, a pretty popular text in early Christianity, and one that over time

286
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,480
will become later associated with the Bogomils and eventually the Cathars. If you're interested

287
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,760
in the Cathars, I have several episodes about them and whether or not they really existed.

288
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,240
Some of their teachings on the nature of the Archons, especially interesting in that they

289
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,880
argued that the eighth highest heaven was again headed by Sabaoth, something we've seen on the

290
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,080
origin of the world, and that they had a lower seven tiered heaven just below that, though in

291
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,640
their system, Satan is actually created by Sabaoth, who is in turn giving rulership over this world,

292
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,120
the physical world Satan dominates it for now. Again, this is an interesting inversion of the

293
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,480
begetting relationships of these Gnostic mythologies, and the other mythology Yaldabaoth generates

294
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,960
Sabaoth, who supplants him here for the Archontics, it's the other way around. The Archontics also

295
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,800
rejected sacraments, including baptism, because they were all performed in the name of the false

296
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,760
god Sabaoth, even though he's the highest one of this realm, he's still fake. Further, by rejecting

297
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,400
the sacraments in the laws of this world, their souls began to make the ascent. It's by rejecting

298
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,240
the sacraments of the Catholic Church, they start their ascent up, making defensive speeches before

299
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,240
each Archon, before finally arriving back at the mother of the Pluroma. This is perhaps Sophia,

300
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,280
wisdom, you get back to be with Sophia. Of course, there's a great deal more of interest in this

301
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,880
sect, and you can read about it in the Panarion. Whose name, by the way, Panarion means bread basket,

302
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,960
so this text always gave me like olive garden vibes. Regardless, this is just a must read text

303
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,760
for anyone interested in Gnosticism. Even if you're sympathetic Gnosticism, you can often read

304
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,120
these heresiological literature like Irenaeus or Hippolytus, and you get so much wonderful

305
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,760
information that it's very much worth reading. In fact, I've done a very long episode on Irenaeus,

306
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,800
one of the earliest sort of anti-Gnostic heresiologists, and you may want to check it out.

307
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,480
It's one of my favorite episodes I've made about Gnosticism on the channel.

308
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,680
Now, any reader of these texts, especially Pistis Sophia and the Apocryphon of John,

309
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:41,120
will face a significant degree of bewilderment at some of the names of the Archons, or their

310
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:48,080
attending angels, demons. So the natural question is just the origins of both the system of Archons,

311
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,480
and why do they have these bizarre names? Why are they named this? The origin question,

312
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,720
while not ever going to be definitively answered, is probably likely maybe that it was common in

313
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,440
the ancient world to attach angels, demons, and daimons to the various celestial regions and

314
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,440
antiquity, and the various celestial objects in antiquity. In fact, this would continue well

315
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,120
under the Middle Ages with angels basically moving planets around as their efficient causation,

316
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,520
and even with magical texts like the Arbital with its various system of invocation of planetary

317
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,760
spirits. Thus, the 12-fold division followed by a 7-fold division followed then by a 365-fold

318
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,360
division, which is found again on the Apocryphon of John. Well, it just nicely captures the circular

319
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,880
dome of the zodiac as the outermost sphere of the geocentric cosmos, in which the moon and the sun

320
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:43,360
and the five classical wandering stars, the planets, move about followed by 365 days of the

321
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,080
solar year. Thus, insofar as the Archons are at the origin and control the fate of the material and

322
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,080
psychical cosmos, including our physical and psychical bodies, they would go from the fixed

323
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,800
stars at the very limit to the very outer edge to the wandering stars down to the days of the year.

324
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,040
This all gives them power over both the physical cosmos of space,

325
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:11,680
but also the processional cosmos of time. It's basically the demonization of the

326
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:18,240
attending beings at work in the cosmos of antiquity. If you take those and just make them all evil,

327
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:25,440
well, they go from being angels and diamonds to being archons. Now, the more difficult issue

328
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,800
is the often bewildering names given to these beings. Now, many of them are clearly derived

329
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:36,240
from Hebrew Aramaic divine names, which are then transposed and corrupted into Greek and Comptic.

330
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,040
These are sometimes traditional angelic names, which simply undergo demonization. A great many

331
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:48,000
of the others, frankly, are perplexing in origin. This is especially true for names like Yaldabaoth,

332
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,800
although there's some guessing that this is maybe Aramaic or Hebrew for the child of chaos or the

333
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,440
begetter of chaos, the maternal spirit Barbello, which again has a kind of Aramaic feel to it,

334
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,160
and the host of archons and angel demons found especially in the names of the beings responsible

335
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,760
for the construction of the primordial, Adamical body in the Apocryphon of John, or the profusion

336
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,160
of entities that populate the treasuries of the books of you and the pistis Sophia among

337
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:20,960
a great many other Gnostic texts. But the situation here isn't totally hopeless. We're not totally

338
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,040
hopeless in terms of finding out where these names may have come from. Interestingly enough,

339
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,920
some of these obscure names are actually found not just in Gnostic literature, but they're also

340
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,200
found in the great archangian collection known to us as the Greek Magical Papyri. In a really

341
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,120
fascinating article, the classicist Howard Jackson locates numerous instances in which many of these

342
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,320
archontic names are also found in a wide range of magical uses, such as Incantations, Nomina

343
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,280
Barbara, which is very important here, and sigil-like uses in the Greek Magical Papyri.

344
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,800
I agree, I think, with his assessment that either the two bodies of literature of Gnostic and Magical

345
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,200
share a common ancestor, that is to say, perhaps they go back to something like the Indigenous

346
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,920
or Egyptian ritual technology, and there's clearly definitely Egyptian words in some of this,

347
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,280
and I think one that's slightly more likely is that the Gnostic texts are actually lifting many

348
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,960
of these archontic names from the Magical literature in the Egyptian context in which these texts,

349
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:26,720
the Gnostic texts, were being composed. Thus, we might very well have a kind of magic to Gnosticism

350
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,320
pipeline in the ancient world, and that even might give us a glimpse into the milieu of the

351
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,680
authors that generated these Gnostic texts. In fact, this is all more, all the more reinforced,

352
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,720
given the definite similarities between the rare instances of Gnostic ritual life,

353
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,280
especially something like the complex baptism rituals to be found in texts like The Books of

354
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,960
You, which I've made a whole episode about those, and the wider range of Greco-Egyptian magic.

355
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,000
There's just no way that those baptism rituals, which are found in books like The Gnostic Book of

356
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,880
You and the magical technologies found in the Greek Magical Papyri, are just not related,

357
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,120
simply not happening. So what I suspect occurred, and again, we'll never know, was a theological

358
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,080
shift very much like the one described quite wonderfully, actually, in M. David Litwas in

359
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,600
his book The Evil Creator, which you absolutely should read, in which the Israelite God is somehow

360
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,680
demonized, and then a two-step process by which the angels' daimons responsible for the movements

361
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:34,560
and processes of the cosmos in the Judeo-Hellenistic worldview of the time were themselves, in turn,

362
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,880
demonized in sets of 12, 7, and 365, though again, the texts aren't terribly systematic,

363
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,720
nor uniform, frankly, though I do think that a set of seven archons seems to have been the

364
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,640
standard among this literature. And finally, these archontic beings, they receive their names

365
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,600
largely derived from Jewish and Greco-Egyptian sources, often traditional Jewish scriptures,

366
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,760
but also especially the complex world of Greco-Egyptian magic. Of course, this theory does not,

367
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:09,520
by any means, eliminate all the mysteries of the origins and nature of the archons. In fact,

368
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,240
this would be an excellent application of something like AI, along with a database of

369
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,800
ancient spirit, daimons, archons, nomina, Barbara, etc., as envisioned by Dr. Kristin Switzer,

370
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,280
who I really hope it's a funding to make just that database. You can find out more about her

371
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,320
in the description. By the way, if you're interested in ancient magic, you absolutely have to check

372
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,000
out her channel, Dr. Switzer. It's one of the best resources out there on just that topic.

373
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,520
At any rate, while the evil demiurge Yael the Baoth often, well, frankly steals the show,

374
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,560
perhaps because of our love for anything with a flair for the Lovecraftian, I hope I've shown

375
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:54,640
that the archons also play a decisively important role, even a surprising role in this wonderfully

376
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,840
weird mythology. I mean, you hardly ever hear about the renegade archon responsible for recreating

377
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,720
Jesus, or the connections of the archons with Greco-Egyptian magic more generally.

378
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:14,000
In these ways, among many others, their role is often downplayed, it's often overshadowed because

379
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,160
we love talking about the evil demiurge, and I think that's a mistake if you want to really

380
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,240
robustly understand these mythologies. As usual, I've included a collection of resources if you

381
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,560
want to really dive into Gnosticism in the description. Again, also check out my playlist

382
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:37,840
on Gnosticism to really go through a bunch of these texts. But until next time, keep resisting

383
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:44,960
those archontic, psychical impulses and ascend into the subvernal realms. Of course, also thanks

384
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:52,160
for watching Esoterica, where we explore the arcane in history, philosophy and religion.
