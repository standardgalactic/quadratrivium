1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,880
All right, I'm live, I'm here with Ervol, and we're going to be discussing

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:37,400
Platonism. How are you doing, Ervol? Not too bad, yourself? Yeah, not too bad. I

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,640
finally, we were meant to do this last week, actually. I didn't give people a

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,120
reason why we cancelled, but I ended up getting that illness everyone has been

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,440
talking about. And, you know, I heard the latest strain was meant to be quite

6
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,840
mild, but it's definitely was one of the one of the worst viruses I've had. But

7
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,360
yeah, doing pretty good. But yeah, as far as Platonism, I mean, some people

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,280
know you as like the Plato guy, you know, you're, but you're doing a reading group

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,280
on it now, which you could chill for later if people are interested in that. But

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,600
yeah, I mean, I guess the first question is why do you think going back to

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:24,560
Plato is of relevance or of such importance? Right. Well, in a lot of ways,

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,600
Plato was in a similar situation to the one that we're in. The traditions of his

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,760
time had been breaking down. You know, if you look at the behavior of the

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,600
Sophists, it resembles that of postmodern academics today, deconstructing things,

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,040
saying the truth is relative, having no reverence for the gods or eternal

16
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
realities and things of that nature, reducing everything to kind of flux

17
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,320
and accidents of the one kind of true material substrate materialistic monism.

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:04,640
And Plato found a way of harmonizing the gods, his tradition, his the ways of his

19
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,120
people with this rationalistic current. And the historical influence obviously

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,000
alone justifies going back to Plato. I don't think you can really seriously

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,920
claim to be a philosopher or to seriously study philosophy unless you go through

22
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,600
the works of Plato, not just because there are so many fundamental ideas introduced

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,640
into the history of Western philosophy through Plato, but because the rest of

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,680
the philosophical tradition is responding to Plato in one way or another, often

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,640
uncharitably, you know, unfairly Nietzsche's critiques of Plato I see is so much

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,840
question begging. I know Heidegger has some critiques and often people in these spheres

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,920
will have read some of these critiques or have heard about some of these critiques of

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,320
Platonism. And then without actually studying Platonism, they write it off because

29
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,680
the people that they respect write it off. I think it's a similar phenomenon to the people

30
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,640
who get into like alternative physics you'll often find or at least I often find these people

31
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,040
on YouTube who have this, you know, new model of physics like vortex physics or physics derived

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,680
from like the 10 basic numbers, kind of like Pythagoreanism. But the reason people go for

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,960
those things is that the people putting forward these radical alternatives at the same time are

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,440
saying the entire history of mathematics and physics up until this time has been wrong.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And then you watching the video say, oh, well, that's convenient because I don't know any of that

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,680
anyway. So now I can just listen to this guy and get it all from him. So I think this kind of anti

37
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:52,000
Platonism offers an out from doing the real work of learning the Western philosophical tradition

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,360
from the ground up. You can't understand any of antique philosophy without understanding Platonism.

39
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
You can't understand scholasticism. You can't understand the thinking of the Renaissance.

40
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,120
You really just can't understand anything in the history of Western philosophy without Plato.

41
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,240
And like I said, the main reason, though, is that we're in a similar position where if we don't

42
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:19,920
harmonize the scientific knowledge that we have today with metaphysics, with our traditional

43
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:27,760
theological conceptions, many of which basically all of which derived from Platonism, we're not

44
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,360
going to have something to unify us going forward. It takes more than just kind of

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
emotive, you know, something a, you know, ineffable quality that people have in a particular sphere

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,240
that galvanizes them. Like that's not what actually builds long lasting historical movements.

47
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:58,480
There has to be a kind of crystalline ideological core that keeps an organization going keeps a

48
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:06,160
group going and motivates them. Pythagoreanism did that. Platonism did that through institutions on

49
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,400
the one hand schools and a core philosophy that people shared in common that explicit

50
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,440
philosophical consensus is the only way to get ethical consensus. So, you know, political

51
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,840
practicalities, learning the history of Western philosophy, and then also, which I didn't mention

52
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,440
yet, I do think that Platonism has the metaphysical toolkit to address the metaphysical deficiencies

53
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,040
of modern physics, right? We have excellent understanding of dynamics in modern physics,

54
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,040
but we don't know very much at all about the substrate. What are these things that are behaving

55
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,840
in the ways that the wave function behaves? You know, what is the stuff that the universe is made

56
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:56,160
of? And what categories can we draw metaphysically to make sense of all of that? So, Platonism is just

57
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,520
one of the most well developed metaphysical frameworks in history. And I think anyone who's

58
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,240
trying a theory of everything these days, like I saw you had Chris Langan on, you know, he's

59
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,120
a key example. I mean, a lot of his ideas are similar to Platonism. I think he would recognize

60
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,960
that. So, yeah, I mean, I think to understand the past, to put us together, gather us together

61
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,160
today in a harmony, and then moving forward for better scientific groundwork for a worldview.

62
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,040
Yeah, well, there is that quote by Alfred North Whitehead that the safest generalization of

63
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:39,680
Western philosophy is the series of footnotes to Plato. And I saw an exaggeration like Richard

64
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:49,360
Rorty, who's the famous American pragmatist, or like a, you know, a complete relativist,

65
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,160
moral relativist, he rejects philosophy. And I forget which one of his books it was,

66
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,200
but he wrote in the introduction that his task was basically to get rid of Platonism.

67
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,560
And he also, he made some, might seem like a radical claim, but he said that all philosophy

68
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,960
since Plato was Platonism, because his claim was that even the people that have rejected Plato have

69
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,880
done so with kind of Platonist starting point, and even just the idea that, you know, thought and

70
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,680
reality, cohere in the way Plato imagined. But yeah, I mean, I do think it's a problem,

71
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,040
especially in like sort of, you know, the St. Raider where you want to call it circles, that

72
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,400
people, people obviously come at philosophy, you know, at other motivations, they're not necessarily

73
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:52,000
trying to get a great grasp of the whole Western canon. I guess they generally have a more instrumental

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,520
view of things. And so I find you get too much, you get a focus on, you know, thinkers like

75
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,480
Evella, Spengler, Nietzsche, obviously. But people want to kind of, you know, they want like

76
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,360
to kind of a simple metric to kind of read all of Western thought through some kind of based

77
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:17,680
metrics like Nietzscheanism, or even like kind of a very simplified, like a Heideggerian critique

78
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:25,920
of techniques and of philosophy. And yeah, that definitely leads to oversight. I think there is

79
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:33,200
a kind of like, you know, meme Nietzscheanism that permeates the right a lot, especially as it

80
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,880
comes to Plato. So I mean, the basic kind of Nietzschean critique of Plato, you see something

81
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:49,520
like Spencer said this a lot that Plato was like the, it was the start of this nihilism that came

82
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:57,280
to fruition with Christianity, where we started to kind of lessen the value of the physical world,

83
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,120
and imagine this perfect world of forms. And that as soon as that, as soon as we started that endeavor,

84
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:11,520
as soon as we started to try and find some perfect world of pure thought, or, you know,

85
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,320
so there's some other world that we started on the path to nihilism, and it was kind of inevitably

86
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,520
going to lead to all of the kind of life denying philosophies we have now and some of the, even

87
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,680
like the sort of extreme liberalism, some people argue that like in the, you know, the kind of

88
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:37,600
transhumanist ethic. So I'm curious, like, what do you think of that kind of basic kind of quasi

89
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,560
Nietzschean criticism of Platonism? Yeah, like, so again, I don't know exactly how true that is to

90
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,360
Nietzsche himself, but it is characteristically Nietzschean in the sense that it's not really an

91
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,760
argument, strictly speaking. It's saying, you know, I don't like the conclusion that you came to.

92
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,440
I'm sentimentally averse, like saying that it leads to nihilism is a kind of moral consequentialism

93
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:09,920
from a moral nihilist, which doesn't even make sense. But yeah, I think the the issue that

94
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,480
Nietzsche has with Platonism is not unique to Platonism. You go all the way back to, like,

95
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,680
Siberian shamanism, presumably from the Paleolithic period, and they had this idea that the world

96
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,280
was divided up into different realms, you know, like you see in Norse mythology on Yigitrasil.

97
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:36,320
There are various realms that you can travel between. And there's good reason why people had these

98
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:45,760
beliefs. There has been a history of spiritual practice that led a lot of people around the

99
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,440
world to common ideas about what sorts of realms are accessible, what sorts of forces

100
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,800
are there to tap into in that realm. If they were all completely wrong, if there is no,

101
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:07,840
you know, supernatural realm whatsoever, then why did these beliefs all persist? And it's just,

102
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,840
you know, question begging saying there isn't any such thing. But you can't just presume that you

103
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:20,400
can't just presuppose the world simply is time, space, causality, and what we see around us. And

104
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,240
that's it. If you buy an evolutionary explanation of perception, which I assume most people who

105
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:34,480
would buy that pseudo Nietzschean critique would, you wouldn't expect evolution to select for the

106
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:42,080
perceptual apparatus that would perceive the genuine like ontological substrate of reality.

107
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:50,000
You would expect evolution to select for perception of fitness payoffs above all. So we'll be

108
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,080
myopically focused on certain facets of reality, like this narrow spectrum of the electromagnetic

109
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,920
spectrum that's narrow bandwidth, visible light. But we don't actually, you know,

110
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,280
know reality just because we see things. This is the way that we navigate is like a user interface

111
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,680
that has developed to help us survive as biological creatures. There's no reason to think that

112
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,480
the categories, the basic intuitive naive categories like matter naively conceived just

113
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,560
is what reality is at base. According to evolutionary theory, wouldn't expect that an

114
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,440
evolutionary game theory, Donald Hoffman came up with the, the fitness beats truth theorem.

115
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,880
And he modeled various evolutionary scenarios and demonstrated that, you know, evolution does not

116
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,840
select for perception of the true nature of whatever system this evolution is taking place in.

117
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:58,640
It selects for like myopic perception of fitness payoffs. And the key insight of Platonism and

118
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:05,040
Pythagoras before him was saying that actually, you know, the way that the world seems at face

119
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:14,240
masks, a deeper harmony that operates according to, you know, different logic than the logic of

120
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,520
everyday reality, you know, bumping into stuff, things colliding like base naive materialism.

121
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,560
Actually, when you investigate the things of the material world and kind of draw down to their

122
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,840
syntactic core, the underlying logic behind mundane phenomena, we find these mathematical

123
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:40,640
structures. And that line, that Platonizing line of putting an ontological status on

124
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,960
universals and mathematical objects led to taking those things seriously, building out a

125
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:56,880
mathematical model of the world. And that actually led to scientific progress. Right. So the idea

126
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,760
of another world is not prima facia ridiculous. It would kind of be strange if the universe in

127
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,600
its entirety was simply what we see around us, like the observable universe just is reality.

128
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,520
We don't have an explanation if we just go with this kind of naive perception of the world as

129
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,640
it seems, we don't have an explanation for where the laws of physics reside. We don't have an

130
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,320
explanation for what universal properties are what ontological status they have. Right. It's

131
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,760
just a very incomplete model of the world that like, and we know that that kind of perception of

132
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,760
the world as being fundamentally flux, you know, inevitably tied to matter, didn't actually build

133
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,720
the math science technology that the modern world is based on. It was the the Platonizers

134
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,160
through our history. You mentioned Alfred North Whitehead, you know, he worked with

135
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,000
Bertrand Russell, who also studied Plato. He criticized Plato in his history of Western

136
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,600
philosophy book. But a lot of his mature developments are obviously inspired by Platonism,

137
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,840
including this kind of intermediate status of mathematical objects. And so they tried to work

138
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,280
up something that was actually in the spirit of Leibniz, a kind of characteristic universalist

139
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,480
universal logical language with their Principia Mathematica, which was largely successful.

140
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,120
Their kind of systematizing of logic mathematics led to developments in computer.

141
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,320
So it was practically useful. But Russell, who was inspired by Platonism, wouldn't have had

142
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,600
this idea unless he was a scholar of Leibniz, which he was, and Leibniz was a Platonist. And

143
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,440
his ideas fit very neatly into Neoplatonism, up to including the idea of the monad, this kind of

144
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,920
fractal embodiment that the monad possesses, we can maybe get into a little bit, a little bit of

145
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:59,120
that later. You know, Frege, who started analytical philosophy, was a Platonist. And then Goethel,

146
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,400
who disproved the basic intention of Principia Mathematica, which was inspired by this computationalist

147
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,200
theory of mathematics, where if we just have the right set of axioms and algorithms, we can have

148
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:18,000
full systematic proof of all propositions. Goethel said, no, you can't. And, you know, that was because

149
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,560
Goethel grasped an aspect of our cognitive faculties that the Platonist grasped that

150
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,280
Russell wanted to leave out, which was intellect, properly speaking, or the mathematical intuition,

151
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,880
which is not exclusively mathematical. But anyway, it's just you see the influence of

152
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:44,160
Platonism through and through with the history of modern philosophy, ancient philosophy. And to say

153
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,280
you don't like the idea of some other realm or that there's something beyond the world that we see,

154
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,760
like, where does that come from? I get the kind of instinct to say, like, you know, the way I've

155
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,200
always thought about the world since I was three, the basic way I perceive things, that's just what

156
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:07,120
it is. And we don't have to go beyond that. And all this math, well, we like abstract the math from

157
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,640
the world. And while that may be in a certain regard epistemologically true, not wholly true,

158
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:21,600
because we also have these intuitions that are not via induction. Yeah, we, nevertheless, you

159
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,480
can't make sense of that kind of account of mathematical objects of universals without, at the

160
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,160
same time, relying on their ultimate validity, like to express the position of nominalism,

161
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,160
you're going to have to use Platonic realism or a belief in the reality of universals. I might be

162
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,200
using a bit too much philosophical jargon for people who are not already into Platonism. But

163
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:51,440
well, I mean, it's a very, it's a very nihilistic position in a way to take this kind of

164
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,840
sort of meme, natuionism approach to everything where you're kind of judging,

165
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,440
you're judging theories based on like how life affirming there, like you're treating philosophy

166
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:12,000
as this sort of therapeutic existentialist cure to the human condition. And you know,

167
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,080
you're already presupposing that there's there's no objective truth to be found or you're already

168
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,800
presupposing like this metaphysical anti realism. But someone in someone in the chat said,

169
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,360
you know, we're going to be discussing Platonism. So he said, you know, and get ready to hear loads

170
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,120
of things that aren't epistemically justified. So I guess that that would be another attitude.

171
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,200
You definitely find it a lot in people that study philosophy now that they kind of assume

172
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,840
that well, you know, you have classical philosophy here. But you know, something happened along the

173
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,880
way. And these people didn't really interrogate their kind of epistemological starting point,

174
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,960
you know, they didn't they didn't really interrogate like what the mind can can really

175
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,680
know about the world. And you know, we've had Hume and Kant and these people sense and, you know,

176
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:04,080
the kind of Copernican turn turn in philosophy. And so this kind of naive kind of approach to

177
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,880
metaphysics is is very outdated. And you're kind of better starting with with more sort of

178
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:19,600
analytical stuff. So like, what would you say the the starting point is for you as a Platonist?

179
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,640
Like, you know, do you assume a kind of naive, you know, are you just sort of start with the

180
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,280
assumption that there's this coherence between the mind and ultimate reality? Or do you think

181
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,480
that there's like a series of sort of smaller scale justifications along the way that have to

182
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:43,360
bring you there? Like, do you start with epistemology? Yeah, well, I'm not a foundationalist

183
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,160
in my own philosophy. So there's no one starting point, you know, I like

184
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:58,080
Quine Willard Quine's Holism, where, you know, inevitably, one proposition, one theory will

185
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,800
implicate other theories in your kind of toolkit. And so ultimately, a whole worldview has to develop

186
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,680
organically. And in terms of internal consistency, and then in terms of explanatory power, in terms of

187
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,880
predictive power, all of these metrics, and then you evaluate whole frameworks on that basis,

188
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,080
rather than the foundationalist attempt at epistemological grounding, where like empiricism,

189
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,840
all knowledge is built up from sense data. And that's, you know, this kind of model of how we

190
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,160
come to have knowledge was really, you know, devastated by Willard Quine in, I think, the 50s.

191
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:44,480
So in analytical philosophy today, that's not a popular epistemological position. Actually,

192
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:52,160
that innovation, this kind of Holism and pragmatism, Quine was a pragmatist, was already there in

193
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:02,240
the old academy, under carnities, I think, when the Platonists took a turn towards skepticism,

194
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,560
academic skepticism, was very different from the other ancient, the other popular ancient

195
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,240
skeptical school of Pyranism, which basically held that all knowledge is simply impossible. And it

196
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,680
was mostly about just kind of reaching a this catharsis and, you know, comfortable state of

197
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,720
mind, resting in a poria, resting in uncertainty, you know, what, what are you going to do? You

198
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,120
can't really figure out anything anyway. Whereas academic skepticism was about like, let's put

199
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,760
forward hypotheses and build up this theory while admitting our own fallibility all the while.

200
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:47,280
Now, within Platonism, there are theories about the basis of higher level knowledge. I think the

201
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,520
most famous example is the divided line from the Republic. So if you remember in book seven of the

202
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,760
Republic, when he discusses the cave, he illustrates the example of the cave afterwards with this

203
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,720
concept of the divided line. So you take a line, which symbolizes the unity of mind as a whole,

204
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,120
divide it in two, but unequally. So one part is larger, one part is smaller, the largeness of

205
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:22,000
this segment of the line represents the security and, you know, firmness of our grasping of

206
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,080
intelligible. So the larger segment is intelligible reality. And then the smaller segment is sensible

207
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:35,200
reality. And we have faculties associated with each of these targets of knowledge. So we have

208
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,680
two discrete faculties that deal with intelligibles and two discrete faculties which deal with

209
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:48,960
sensibles. And so you divide the shorter segment according to the same ratio, which is the ratio

210
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:57,120
of bi, and the smallest of all segments will have to do with our recognition of images as such.

211
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,000
You know, Schopenhauer had a similar distinction between, you know, pure sensation and perception.

212
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,640
So for, this is already there in Neoplatonism by the time of Iamblichus and arguably, I mean,

213
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,080
by the time of Plato himself, Iamblichus actually ascribes the concept of the divided line and these,

214
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,520
this theory of cognitive faculties to Architas of Tarentum, who is an elder contemporary of Plato,

215
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:29,120
early member of the Academy, you know, genuine, you know, old Pythagorean contributed to development

216
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:38,000
mathematics and all of that. But yeah, this, so at the bottom, we have this faculty of basically

217
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,360
sensation or imagination, which has to do with recognizing similarity and dissimilarity. That's

218
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,920
the distinguishing feature of that cognitive faculty, which is Icazia in Greek. And then we have

219
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,400
doxar belief, which is what Schopenhauer would call perception, where instead of just treating the raw

220
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,800
kind of phenomenological appearance of form and distinguishing forms in that lower sense,

221
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:10,000
like the shape of things in their similarity, we have the, you know, hypothesis of some underlying

222
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,680
reality, which we only know by inference, just as Schopenhauer says, we don't know the objects of

223
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:24,560
material reality directly. We infer from the presence of sense data, you know, Locke basically

224
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,000
agrees with this, this model of things as well, and they got it from the ancients, you know,

225
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
this stuff was already there in Plato. And then on the intelligible side, the smaller faculty

226
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,440
is Dianoya, which is discursive reasoning, which is step by step procedures, you know,

227
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,600
similar to the computationalist project of Russell and Whitehead. And then above

228
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:57,920
that kind of reason, there is intellect or noose, which is an intuitive faculty, and you have to

229
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:05,280
have this idea to make mathematics work. There has to be something in our mind that allows us to find

230
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:13,600
correct axioms for mathematics, right? You can't prove the validity of an axiom in math through

231
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,160
any mathematical formal system. So there has to be something beyond Dianoya that we're using there.

232
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:27,600
So this basic, you know, schema of the psyche, I think holds pretty true, you know, and it's

233
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,120
interesting that Dianoya has a kind of dual role. So there's a strict sense of Dianoya where we see

234
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:40,080
its peculiar energies, activities, most starkly, which is in mathematical and logical reasoning,

235
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,280
but also the literal translation is through thinking. And it is what basically moves us

236
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:57,120
from Icazia to Daxa to Dianoya, strictly speaking, to the intellect. And yeah, so there's something

237
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:05,520
mathematical or logical or like Turing machine like about human cognition, broadly speaking. And

238
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,320
yeah, that's it's a very interesting notion that ties in with the idea of the soul, the composition

239
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,440
of the soul, the essence of the soul that you see in the Timaeus, when the Demiurge constructs

240
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,520
the world soul, he constructs that soul out of ratios. He takes the powers of two and the powers

241
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:31,520
of three, and through a set of kind of algorithmic procedures, builds all of the ratios that we get

242
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:39,520
in music of the perfect fifth, perfect fourth, octave, and so forth. And, you know, this is

243
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,720
the composition of the essence of the soul in some way. So math is on the same level as soul.

244
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,120
Some people might have heard in Platonism that mathematical objects are an intermediary level

245
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:58,560
between the forms, which are unitive, unextended, and then material reality, which is divisible

246
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:06,880
about body. So math is an intermediary. So is soul. So soul and math are very intimately related. And,

247
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,640
you know, if we're going to follow the prescription of the Delphic Oracle to know

248
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,720
thyself, we also have to know math, which kind of ties into this idea, like people criticize

249
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,840
Plato for turning his back on tradition. Well, I mean, he references one commandment from the

250
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,520
Oracle to double the size of a particular altar, and they realized that they couldn't do it

251
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,440
mathematically, because they didn't know how to calculate double the volume of this shape.

252
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,320
So it revealed a kind of defect of mathematical reasoning. So in that instance, Plato refers

253
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,560
to what are the gods telling us? They're telling us we don't know enough math yet.

254
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,760
And, yeah, I kind of ramble a little bit at the end there. But

255
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,480
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was muted. Yeah, that's another kind of interesting

256
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,280
disagreement is the time when Plato came along. So again, this is where you get there's kind of

257
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,240
a Nietzschean version of this versus kind of a more traditionalist version of this. So

258
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,760
the kind of Nietzschean version of it is that, you know, Socrates should have been put to debt

259
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:27,280
because he was questioning the gods. He was undermining the social order of where he lived.

260
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,680
And, you know, he was trying to apply universal reason in this way that was kind of undermining

261
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,720
the particularist paganism of his society. And again, that this is like a very nihilistic enterprise.

262
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,600
Now, if you read Julius Evela actually criticizes this few a lot, he says that this is like a

263
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,520
really bad reading of things that actually what Plato was doing was in a current where

264
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Sophism and Humanism had become kind of dominant intellectually, he says it's actually very

265
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,280
similar to our own time that what Plato was actually doing was kind of,

266
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,320
you know, he's kind of revivifying like a traditionalist cosmology. So again, it's kind

267
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,200
of interesting. It's two very different readings. You know, Plato is this sort of

268
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,840
libtard revolutionary that's like subversive Socrates subversive versus actually, you know,

269
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,640
Plato is seeing like the nihilistic elements thought of his time and he's trying to have

270
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,040
things on this more solid foundation and I kind of ground a proper view of things again.

271
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,520
So, yeah, can you speak to that a little bit like the, you know, the time frame where Plato

272
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,000
was operating like kind of the popular current of thought that he's responding to and what you

273
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,200
think of that idea of it being kind of subversive to the society at the time?

274
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:58,000
Right, yeah. Well, the reason why Socrates probably was actually put to death was his

275
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,080
connection with members of the 30 tyrants, the puppet regime that Sparta installed after the

276
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,160
end of the Peloponnesian War. There's a lot of quotes throughout the dialogues where Socrates

277
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,320
seems to reverence the Spartans, you know, mentioned that they are actually really good

278
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,800
philosophers and that's why they have these laconic sayings. They're so pithy. So it was

279
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:28,560
probably a matter of questioning Socrates' loyalty and, you know, the charge of impiety

280
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:35,040
and was he questioning the gods? I mean, if you look at, you know, again, in the Republic,

281
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,440
Thrasomachus or in the Gorgias, Calakles, the way these characters, the kind of protonegians of

282
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:48,560
their day, were talking about the gods was far more sacrilegious than anything Socrates ever

283
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:55,680
indicated. And I think Plato had a sincere piety. I mean, Neoplatonists all the way down to late

284
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:03,040
antiquity were, you know, practicing their rights. They were worshiping the gods. So this charge of

285
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,960
sacrilege or impiety or denying the existence of the gods was probably just an excuse to get

286
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:18,240
rid of someone who the, you know, Democrats in power in Athens, viewed to be a threat to the

287
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,160
state because of their questionable loyalty. And then the large influence they had on

288
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,520
prominent young noble citizens, you know, Socrates would go around the city finding,

289
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:39,760
you know, the Alcibiades is the competent, talented young men, not to indulge whatever

290
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,960
pederastic impulse he may have had, which he never endorses explicitly. Plato never endorses that

291
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:54,720
it is acknowledged as a common sentiment, you know, among many different Greek city states.

292
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,440
But Plato rejects that anyway. But it wasn't for that reason that Socrates associated with

293
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,440
young men, it was to influence the future thinking of the political class of Athens.

294
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:14,320
So yeah, I mean, I see Plato basically is trying to save respect for the gods,

295
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:22,320
respect for this higher realm from the deconstruction of people like Gorgias or

296
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,800
Protagoras. I mean, the Sophists are really one of the chief currents that he's responding to,

297
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:36,560
but also the rationalistic philosophy of the Ionian school, you know, the best example

298
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:44,560
that directly influenced Plato was Anaxagoras, who taught Pericles, the great Athenian statesman,

299
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,480
and also Socrates studied the works of Anaxagoras. And what Plato liked about Anaxagoras was the

300
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,120
put this principle of mind first, which none of the other Ionian preseocratics did. They

301
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,840
kept things very kind of physical in their conception, although I do think that's an oversimplification.

302
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:10,320
But with the actual writings of Anaxagoras, according to Socrates in the, which dialogue was

303
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:18,240
this, might even be Thedo, not sure. But anyway, he says that Anaxagoras, the writings had to do

304
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:25,200
with like physical laws. He was more like a physicist than a philosopher, strictly speaking.

305
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,880
And it was this rationalism combined with the deconstructing Sophists and

306
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,560
rhetoricians of his day that Plato had to respond to. And they were sacrilegious. I mean,

307
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,400
the Orphism was just a kind of history of the

308
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:53,120
tendencies in that day. Orphism spread from around 600 BC in the wake of basically a dying

309
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:00,400
off of respect for the older, you know, perhaps Mycenaean way of worshiping the gods. So they

310
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:07,200
already broke down their their previous religious rituals. And Orphism came in the wake of that

311
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,000
with this kind of more mystical, more experiential brand of religion. And of course, the mystery

312
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,040
schools were still popular. But there was a kind of irrationalism introduced. And, you know, an

313
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:28,880
emphasis on individual experience. And basically, Plato had to fit that brand of spirituality

314
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,240
together with this rationalistic philosophy. And then the Pythagorean influence coming from

315
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:42,000
the Eliadex, the Italian school. And yeah, I mean, he just kind of found the best harmony to bring

316
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,480
it all together. I think we might actually be overestimating how much is original to Plato,

317
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,680
because we don't know very much about his Pythagorean associates, we have a couple fragments of

318
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:59,200
Arcatas, of, you know, Philo Laos, or some of the other people, or Aristocenus or something in his

319
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,920
school. But Plato was originally interested in writing plays, he wrote poems. And then when

320
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,000
he met Socrates, he decided, this isn't the way to go, I have to do something in the vein of this

321
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,360
emerging trend of philosophy, which he correctly foresaw, would have this massive influence on

322
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:25,280
society. And so he shifted his artistic endeavors, but he kind of remains like,

323
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,640
really tied to the format of the dialogue, to constructing these organic holes, you know,

324
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:40,720
his concepts and aesthetics, many of which were probably original, can be seen today still in

325
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,080
concepts like what makes an integrated work of art. But that's, I think, where Plato's heart was,

326
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:52,880
and he fit all of these tendencies of thought into one harmonious whole. So he was really a

327
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:00,640
synthesizer of the ideas at his time. And, you know, he did it successfully, he built the institution

328
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,640
that needed to be built, and his way of thinking largely won out. Although, of course, Aristotle

329
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,920
disagreed in certain ways, he was still largely a Platonist, you know, the agreement between Aristotle

330
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,960
and Plato is much greater than the disagreement. And so Aristotle gets kind of more credit,

331
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:26,000
perhaps because, as Alexander spread Hellenism, you know, Aristotle had a pride of place for a

332
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:34,160
couple centuries, and then later Platonism had a resurgence. So, you know, there's an argument

333
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,840
to be made that maybe Aristotle contributed more in certain respects than Plato. Again,

334
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,440
I'm kind of digressing from your point. But yeah, I think Plato is trying to harmonize the currents

335
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,960
of his day, and save the gods and save his traditional ways of worship, and at the same time,

336
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,120
arrive at the truth underlying reality. It's like this nihilism that you mentioned,

337
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,080
you can't just want the world to be a certain way, and then like,

338
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,040
blind yourself to what may actually be out there. You can't know the nature of underlying

339
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,800
reality unless you question these basic concepts. If you just presume that there are no universals,

340
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,080
there are only particulars, and realities, this basic flux, like, why do you think that,

341
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,080
how do you justify that? If you're going to try to build a rationalistic framework,

342
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,920
you're going to have to basically go along with what Plato did. Plato was the first one to do it

343
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,840
in a serious way, the Pythagoreans, and then Plato. And there's, everyone kind of followed in his

344
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:40,000
train because there's probably one true nature to reality. And, you know, this is the perennial

345
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,240
philosophy idea, you're not going to digress from that very far. And so if Plato put it adequately,

346
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,480
then kind of have to take the tools that you're given. And Plato is very traditional for us.

347
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,720
I mean, you can't understand modern Western civilization without him. So, yeah.

348
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,520
Yeah, Platonism is, it is the kind of metaphysics of the perennial philosophy. I mean,

349
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,920
I think Shu'an of the traditional school basically considered neoplatonism,

350
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,000
like kind of a divine revelation to the West, like it's the Western version of the perennial

351
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,880
philosophy. But you mentioned Pythagoras. I remember, I don't know if you saw,

352
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,920
like a decade ago, they supposedly uncovered that there was like a secret Pythagorean message

353
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,760
in the Republic that every 12 lines, there was a mention of music and they were speculating that

354
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,120
you could, you could create like musical notes out of out of messages he'd inserted in there

355
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:47,760
with numbers. And that this was a sign that Plato was like a secret Pythagorean because the Pythagorean

356
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:55,200
sect was persecuted at the time. Now Pythagoras, you know, obviously like the vegetarianism and

357
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,280
some of his ideas, I think there is a popular idea that he got his philosophy from India, right,

358
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:08,560
that he traveled to India and he kind of brought back Vedanta. There's also, I don't know if this

359
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,480
is confirmed, but there's also theories that Plato took his philosophy from like mystery schools in

360
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:22,320
Egypt. So do you have any insight in terms of like kind of like an esoteric element to Plato or

361
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,800
kind of a religious origin of his teachings? Or, you know, is the similarities to the perennial

362
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,520
philosophy? Is that just kind of a testament to, you know, reason brings you to this system if you

363
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:41,920
follow it fair enough? Yeah, my basic model of the axial age as a whole is that it diffuses from

364
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,400
the Punjab basically. The Upanishadic philosophy originates around year 1000 BC,

365
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,200
and then we see movements towards rationalistic, I mean, Upanishads are written in dialogue form,

366
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:04,080
that's healthy something, many of them. So these ideas of perennialism I see is coming out of India

367
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:11,840
primarily, although there may be more ancient, similar systems out of Egypt. So like we have

368
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,120
to remember this time period in the aftermath of the Bronze Age collapse, right? There was a

369
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:26,960
2000 year long civilization from 3000 BC to 1000 BC, very roughly speaking, that was on a larger

370
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:34,880
scale in many ways, better organized than the state of things in the Greek Dark Ages, for example,

371
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,760
which is the times that, you know, classical antiquity comes out of. And those Bronze Age

372
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,320
civilizations had a common source, right? Prior to the civilizations properly speaking, there were

373
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:58,640
advanced, you know, city based cultures in Syria, in Iraq, you know, the Fertile Crescent, and,

374
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,200
you know, in Egypt, starting around 5000 BC, arguably a little bit older, but going all the way back

375
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,480
to 10,000 BC. And this happens with the spread of Neolithic technologies generally, they're

376
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,440
identifiable gene clusters that are associated with this, that we are related to in many ways. So

377
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,720
like a lot of people want to go back to the Bronze Age and learn as Aryans or whatever. But like

378
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:28,720
we're also this kind of ancient Neolithic, Neolithicizing force, like a third of our

379
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,640
ancestry is associated with that Anatolian hunter-gatherer population that was integral to the

380
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,040
spread of the Neolithic. And it's that bundle of technologies that seeded what would later become

381
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:52,080
the civilizations in southern Iran, in the Indus Valley, so Indus Valley civilization. And I imagine

382
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,040
that, I mean, they were all in contact, there was trade between the Indus Valley civilization

383
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:04,720
and Egypt via, you know, Fertile Crescent intermediaries. But ideas spread during that whole

384
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:12,640
preceding arc of civilization. So it may be then that what we see coming out of Upanishadic

385
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:20,960
philosophy is really a resurgence of older Indus Valley traditions, not that all of them, all of

386
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:28,720
the beliefs of Vedanta come out of that. Obviously, the rest of the Vedas are still significant, the

387
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:38,160
ritual forms, the ideas contained in the older sections of the four Vedas matter religiously to

388
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:45,760
Hindus. But some of these ideas, like maybe reincarnation, although there are some Indo-European

389
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,960
precedents, it's far from a settled matter. But yoga, for example, I would say very likely comes

390
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,520
from the Indus Valley civilization complex rather than an Indo-European innovation.

391
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,200
So maybe some of what we see in Plato that looks Indian, I mean, that's what I recognize,

392
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,200
that's why I was able to understand Plato as well as I was when I first read it. You know,

393
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,760
I got into the Neoplatonist later, I read Plato directly, and I saw it basically through a lens

394
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,480
of Vedanta, and it made sense through that lens fairly easily. Like a lot of the ideas are the

395
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,280
same up to and including the tripartite soul, you have basically, you know, intellect,

396
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,640
thumos, epithumia, or appetite, which equates to Satva, Rajas, and Thomas in Hinduism.

397
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:39,120
So anyway, some of this stuff that looks Indian might just be the ancient Bronze Age layer

398
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:46,800
that Plato and Pythagoras got from Egypt, from the Chaldeans, you know, the Syrians basically.

399
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:55,120
And there's, you know, one more esoteric aspect here that might be in the background,

400
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,680
which is Plato's idea of Atlantis. And if you look at the beginning of the Neolithic,

401
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,040
I have a four-part series on prehistory, the fourth part deals with, you know,

402
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,200
the emergence of civilization. It's probably the most condensed anthropology lecture you could watch

403
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:18,160
on that period of time from like 15,000 BC down to 3000 BC. A lot happens, you know, and we're not

404
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,000
sure how these developments take place, or why, and why they're so fast, why they're so concentrated

405
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,080
in one particular region, like how the people who built Gobekli Tapu, for example, learned how to

406
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,120
deal with megaliths overnight, and then they got worse at it, which is not what you would expect,

407
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:41,200
right, if they just came out of a hunter-gatherer society. So people have often speculated that

408
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:48,400
there was a more advanced civilization prior to the Younger Dryas, which runs from, you know,

409
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:58,080
basically 11,000 to 10,000 or 9,500 BC. And that was a kind of mini ice age. So it had been warming up

410
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:05,920
from 20,000 years ago until, you know, 13,000 years ago. And it's very likely that, you know,

411
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,400
just as with the Holocene warming, we saw the emergence of larger populations, you know,

412
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,000
larger settlements, you had a similar thing happen at the end of the Upper Paleolithic.

413
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,040
And then that was upset by the Younger Dryas very suddenly, you know, in a matter of decades,

414
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,480
the temperature dropped, you know, five, six degrees globally, something really extreme.

415
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,280
And that lines up with the timeframe that Plato actually gives for the myth of Atlantis.

416
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,360
So, I mean, you can make of that what you will. I give credit to those theories of an

417
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,560
advanced ancient civilization, because there are archaeological anomalies that just have

418
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,360
no explanation whatsoever. You can obviously ignore those like the Baalbek,

419
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:59,120
Megalith, or some of the structures in Egypt that seem to predate other structured people

420
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:05,040
speculate about a date of the Sphinx being older. You know, I'm not sure about each particular piece

421
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,480
of evidence, but an expert in archaeology, but there are many such sites. There's a Megalith

422
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:17,040
underwater between Sicily and Italy, I think, and no one knows. It seems to be 13,000 years old,

423
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:23,200
no one knows who built it or how. Some of these anomalies that point to the possibility of some

424
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:30,480
advanced culture, we could go further into that obviously, but it's a long digression. But if

425
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,080
there was this ancient high civilization, they just think about what kind of technology they

426
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:42,160
would have developed. They were different genetically than later peoples. They had higher Neanderthal

427
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,120
admixture, and the structure of the Neanderthal brain was quite different. Their cerebellum was

428
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:56,240
larger, the human, the Homo sapiens, cerebrum is larger. Neanderthals were very intuitive in

429
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,240
their ways of doing things. The forms of their tools didn't change very much over hundreds of

430
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,120
thousands of years, and yet they were successful. We have a hard time replicating their tools.

431
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,520
It was like they had an extreme ability to get the knack of something. What humans are good at

432
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,880
is innovating and thinking analytically and combining things in different ways, whereas the

433
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,760
Neanderthals kind of felled their channel and their groove and really just settled into it.

434
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,480
So that might have been more like the way of thinking of this ancient high civilization,

435
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:36,880
and people speculate whether it had something to do with acoustics, the rise of advanced

436
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:44,160
upper Paleolithic cultures in Europe coincides with the first musical instruments. Many of the

437
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:51,200
important ritual sites are also coincidentally caves that have great acoustics. So you could

438
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:57,760
speculate some kind of acoustic-based technology in the upper Paleolithic, culminating in a high

439
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,760
civilization that maybe did have an empire, basically, like Plato says that Atlantis had,

440
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,040
and then it was rapidly destroyed by the onset of the Younger Dryas, which may or may not have been

441
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,360
started by a comet. Right now, the evidence does look like it started with a comet.

442
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:19,440
So that's the most esoteric side of Platonism, is Platonism through the Pythagoreans that he knew

443
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,040
and through his own travels. He traveled for 10 years after Socrates died. So Plato himself may

444
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:32,080
have actually made it to India. So there is probably some Indian wisdom in there, some vestigial

445
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:38,960
bronze age wisdom via the Chaldeans and via the Egyptians, and then perhaps this most ancient layer,

446
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,280
which we can only speculate about, but it is fun to speculate about that.

447
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:52,880
Yeah, I used to be really into Atlantis archaeology stuff as well. I think the most

448
00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:00,400
interesting angle is there was a guy, Schwaller de Lubitz, who was like an Egyptologist and a mystic.

449
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,520
And he inspired John Anthony West, who's a really good book on Egypt called Serpent in the Sky,

450
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,680
where he gets into like the cosmology of the ancient Egyptians and how that was reflected in

451
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:24,400
their architecture. But he speculated that, both of them speculated that the Sphinx was like eroded

452
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:32,800
by water. It's the back when there was rain in the Sahara Desert. The second guy West actually

453
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,000
hired this guy called Robert Schock, who is like a geologist who's an expert in stuff to actually

454
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,040
study the pattern of erosion on the Sphinx. And he did conclude that it was from rainfall,

455
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:53,280
and he actually ended up dating it to like 9,700 BC, which was the date when Plato gave for

456
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,560
the fall of Atlantis. So yeah, there's a lot of interest in esoteric red pills there.

457
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:06,880
But yeah, I mean, I guess to get into like the sort of meat and bones of Platonism,

458
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,440
obviously, you know, one thing you've touched on a bit and that people obviously associate most

459
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,920
of Plato is this idea of the forms. Now, just before we get into it, I mean, can you give like a

460
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,120
basic background of why does Plato propose the forms in the first place? And how do they

461
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,800
help him make sense of the world in a way that he thinks other philosophers are missing?

462
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:41,120
Right. Well, a lot of it is tied to the ethical focus of Socrates, right? I think if you read

463
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:48,800
Xenophon, Socrates does come across as more of this strictly moral philosopher. Plato maybe puts

464
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:55,360
a bit more Pythagoreanism into the mouth of Socrates than Socrates actually held to. But

465
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:01,120
the way we are introduced to the concept of the forms through the dialogues is often Socrates

466
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:11,680
asking about the nature of something like wisdom, or just virtue in general, and trying to get down

467
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:20,080
to what actually is this that we're talking about. If there are only particular

468
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:27,600
virtuous men, but no true virtue, then the idea that there are particular virtuous men becomes

469
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:34,000
vacuous, right? If you're going to take the existence of good seriously, if there is such a

470
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,240
thing, if there is justice, they have to have some kind of metaphysical status, right? Like,

471
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:52,080
it's nonsense to ascribe a label to a particular society or man unless that label has a meaning.

472
00:51:52,080 --> 00:52:00,560
Like, what is it ultimately referring to? This gets fleshed out kind of analogically with

473
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:10,240
math, right? We have to believe that there is some perfect circle, because we never, like,

474
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,600
where do we get the idea of perfect circularity? We can mathematically define it precisely,

475
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:21,120
up to the point where you get the value of Pi coming out of it, which is irrational and goes on

476
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:27,840
infinitely. So infinite, potentially infinite specification of this perfect circle. And yet,

477
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:36,160
we don't see that in the empirical world anywhere. There's just, you know, there's no way of making

478
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:45,360
sense of the labels that we apply to universal phenomena, moral concepts like justice or courage

479
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:53,760
or things like that, or mathematical phenomena. So it's really, in the dialogues, it's presented

480
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:01,040
in terms of, well, we're trying to explain what this thing is that people in common parliaments

481
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,320
are referring to. You can keep it at that level and just say, well, this is the way people use

482
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:12,640
this word. But if you never trace it back to some universal property or universal characteristic

483
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,760
that all of these particulars actually have, and that universal has an independent ontological

484
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,480
status, then there's no accounting for the similarity of the particulars. Why does the

485
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:31,280
linguistic reference work? That is what nominalists miss. So, like, the thing is, we don't actually

486
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:37,600
get great arguments for the theory of forms in many of Plato's dialogues. He leaves it at this

487
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:45,120
kind of rudimentary stage. And many people would say the reason for that is that Plato reserved

488
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:53,280
the more Pythagorean doctrines for his inner circle, for the people within the walls of the academy.

489
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:04,080
And Thomas Taylor, the 18th and 19th century Platonist, wrote a book on Aristotle, where he

490
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:10,160
basically said that Aristotle, just like Plato, was actually cloaking his real ideas, and that

491
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:16,800
this was a tradition that went back to the Greek sages, to the Presocratics as well. It was viewed

492
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:25,360
as taboo, for example, to expose the goings-on of the mystery cults. You couldn't tell people what

493
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:35,440
happened at the mysteries of Lucis. And so similarly, because the philosophy of the Ionians comes out of

494
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,560
a culture where these mystery schools had this preeminent place, the philosophy was tied with

495
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:48,160
the doctrines of the mystery schools. And so certain elements of philosophy then were, you know, not

496
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,920
for the masses. They were not for mass consumption, not for the Voipalloi. So, Aristotle cloaked his

497
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:03,760
ideas through this kind of very dense and hard to parse prose, which is unprecedented in literary

498
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,640
history, like the way that Aristotle wrote is unique. And he didn't just write that way because

499
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,680
he was autistic, although it seems like he probably was, but because he was trying to cloak

500
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,640
the kind of core metaphysical doctrines that he was actually talking around in some way,

501
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:26,480
according to Thomas Taylor. Plato also cloaked his ideas by putting, you know, some parts of the

502
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,880
core doctrine in one character's mouth, and then another part of the core doctrine in the

503
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:37,760
mouth of Socrates and leaving the picture incomplete, often ending the dialogue in Aporia.

504
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,960
And so this is a criticism that people will make of the theory of forms is that, well, exactly how

505
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:50,160
does participation work? You know, what's the dynamic here ultimately? And the answer is it's

506
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:57,520
actually a very complex technical system that you can abstract out of it. Proclus wrote a commentary

507
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:03,920
on the Parmenides that spells this out. Nicholas of Cusa said that this was the most important

508
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,280
book in the history of philosophy. Parmenides comment, sorry, Proclus' commentary on the

509
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,360
Parmenides. But then on the other hand, Schopenhauer said it was the most tedious book in the world.

510
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:21,760
So, you know, take that for what you will. But in this commentary, he, Proclus, spells out that

511
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:28,960
Parmenides is not, as it first appears, just shooting down Socrates' theory of forms. In the

512
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:35,920
dialogue, Socrates is young in his early 20s, maybe Zeno is about 40, and then Parmenides is older,

513
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:42,720
60, 70, or something like that. And Socrates listens to the arguments of Zeno for monism,

514
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:48,640
basically. Zeno argues against multiplicity. Parmenides argues for unity. It's two sides of

515
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:54,160
the same coin, and they represent the same basic philosophy, which is an offshoot of Pythagoreanism

516
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:00,320
itself. And so if you read the Parmenides, which is very difficult to read, it's not

517
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,800
like the other dialogues in a lot of ways. The beginning is easy enough, and then it gets into

518
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:12,320
these long chains where Parmenides is meant to explicate the dialectical method. And it proceeds

519
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,680
in a kind of mathematical way where you look at the kind of hypothesis, and then it's opposite,

520
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:23,520
and then another set of opposites. And so you just get very lost in all of these considerations,

521
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:29,120
like if there is no one, then there is the very high level of abstraction the whole time. So it's

522
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:34,320
like, I read it the first time before I had read Proclas, and I basically just gave up trying to

523
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:39,920
understand it about halfway through. I think anyone who's honest with themselves will say-

524
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,720
Yeah, me too. I never finished Parmenides.

525
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:49,040
No. Yeah, it's a different kind of thing. Well, Proclas makes it clearer. And so at face value,

526
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,760
it seems like Parmenides is shooting down Socrates' theory, but what he's actually doing is pointing

527
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,800
out that Socrates needs to introduce certain kind of fine distinctions, subtle distinctions in

528
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:06,800
theory of forms to make them work. And the core doctrine that Proclas argues for in his commentary

529
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:13,040
is the idea that there is the the unitive and imperticipable aspect of the form where they

530
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,880
exist in themselves in the same way that like, you know, in physics, the Schrödinger equation,

531
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:25,440
the universal wave function kind of has its own form and existence eternally. It's a standing wave

532
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:34,320
and particular things relate to it, relativistically, but it is this permanent reality. Well, the forms

533
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:40,720
have to have an element like that. It's not that the forms extend like the analogy that Socrates

534
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,600
ends up using is actually, I think Parmenides provides it for Socrates in the dialogue, but is

535
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:52,800
like, okay, so the form of justice is like a sail, you know, a big piece of cloth that spreads over

536
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,280
many particular men and touches them all. And Socrates is like, yeah, I guess it's something

537
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:03,840
like that. But that doesn't work because it doesn't preserve the unity of this one thing

538
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:09,600
that you're referring to, because obviously, the entire cloth has extension. So like, if the forms

539
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:16,960
are only in particulars, that, you know, looks like Aristotle's hyalomorphism, then how it doesn't

540
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:23,360
actually get you any closer to explaining this unitary characteristic that is seen in the multiplicity.

541
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:28,400
That's the basic problem of the forms. How do you account for the similarity, the oneness

542
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,200
in multiplicity? There has to be an element of the forms that is unitive, that is exempt,

543
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,280
and for Plato, that does basically exist in a kind of realm independent of this realm.

544
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,920
And this realm is dependent on it. And so it's not exactly that there's like a separate realm

545
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,400
of forms, and then this realm, it's rather that this realm is an outgrowth of the realm of forms.

546
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,680
And so there's a prior ontological status to these universals in the same way that there's a

547
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:01,600
prior ontological status to the Schrodinger equation, or whatever medium it describes,

548
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:07,520
right? The ether is older than any particular configuration of matter, let's say. Another

549
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:13,760
analogy might be like in chess, you know, a particular position on the board, when like

550
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:20,000
Nakamura and Carlson are playing, hasn't been reached before, it's still real, but it's not

551
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,640
as essential to chess as like the way that the knight moves, or the number of squares on the board.

552
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:32,960
Those more fundamental, more syntactic, more internal features of chess have a prior ontological

553
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:41,040
reality. The particular position reached in Nakamura v. Carlson is dependent on the way

554
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:45,520
that the knight moves, and the number of squares, and stuff like that. So you have to have this

555
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:52,400
prior ontological status to general syntactic features of reality. Otherwise, good luck trying

556
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:58,800
to explain how similarity works, how the laws of physics work, where they subsist, why math

557
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:04,160
describes the world. It's just like there's really no coherent rational picture you can

558
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:10,240
make unless you take this leap of saying, yes, there is an independent ontological status to

559
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,720
these universal characteristics, which we describe and indicate in particulars in the world.

560
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:24,000
All right, so if I just like play the nominalist for a minute, I mean,

561
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:32,160
you could say why do the forms have to exist outside of our sort of shared abstraction?

562
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:39,120
Well, the question is, why did we come to that shared abstraction? The question is,

563
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:44,720
why does the abstraction work? It seems like nominalists always just ignore that question,

564
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:52,880
like it doesn't get you any closer. Well, in the case of, like I said, we look at the form of

565
01:01:52,880 --> 01:02:00,320
hoarseness. Perhaps they would argue that with what we know about evolution, species are much more

566
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,520
in flux, so we might recognize, and there's kind of intermediary species, and there isn't really

567
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:13,680
a final end for species. There isn't a final hoarseness. So we're seeing many particular

568
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,480
instances of horses, but what would a perfect horse be in that scenario? You could say like the

569
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:25,760
most adaptive horse, but then that's like different, you could say for each horse dependent on like

570
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:35,440
their geographical location or something. Yeah, well, that kind of raises the question of whether

571
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:45,520
this system, this evolutionary context, had from the outset certain states, certain stable states

572
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:51,680
that it could reach, right? If you're tied to like an a theory of time, if you're tied to like the

573
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:57,840
world just is what's happening right now, and there's no eternal reality whatsoever, then you

574
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:04,720
can try to skirt this question. But you'll be, if you try to do that, you'll be left with no theory

575
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:11,040
of counterfactuals. David Lewis, contemporary philosopher, put forward the theory of modal

576
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:17,680
realism to account for the truth status of counterfactual propositions. Statements like if

577
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:24,320
Johnny had made the last basket, his team would have won the game, that can be true, like we can

578
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:29,920
all recognize that that's true, but what is the referent? What is it that makes that statement

579
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:36,000
true if there's no counterfactual thing that is being referred to? So Lewis just bites the bullet

580
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,040
and like accepts the, yeah, these other worlds are out there. But anyway, what that allows you to do

581
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:47,120
then in terms of identifying species is say that, okay, there is this evolutionary matrix, there's

582
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:52,000
certain patterns of behavior that themselves have a universal reality, like evolution itself

583
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,200
is a universal phenomenon. Okay, now where's that in the nominalist picture? Like again,

584
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,640
any time you try to justify nominalism, you're going to have to fall back on

585
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:06,480
some realist concept to ground it, because pure nominalism just dissolves into nonsense,

586
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,000
because there can't be any like true reference ultimately, because things are changing too much.

587
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:19,520
But anyway, you can say that there is a stable state within an evolutionary system by comparing

588
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:26,320
all of the possible paths of evolution. And then you can describe basically as we do in quantum

589
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:33,920
mechanics, a wave function that has the kind of probability of this stable outcome, which will

590
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:40,480
have a particular center, there will be an archetypal member of the species that like most closely

591
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:47,680
approximates that stable state that can find that stable solution, you know, evolution,

592
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:53,760
it's their objective features that allow you to either succeed or fail. And you have those

593
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,720
features or not. And they are there are a set of features that for a given environment are that

594
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:05,840
most stable position. And we do see in evolutionary systems, not this gradual transformation between

595
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:14,400
infinite intermediary forms. Instead, we see people and species locking into these stable types,

596
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:21,840
archetypes that work, you know, geometrically, in terms of blood flow, like their physical

597
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:30,400
constraints that define a range of variables. And there are stable, you know, values for that

598
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,920
those sets of variables and unstable values. And again, across the spectrum of all possible worlds

599
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,400
in which this evolutionary context happens, you can draw that kind of probability distribution,

600
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:46,400
which will have a center on one ideal, most stable structure.

601
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:55,120
All right, as far as let's say as far as it's applied to morality, like the

602
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:03,200
you're talking about justice. So, you know, perhaps the modern nominalist would would say that

603
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,760
your argument is kind of similar to the nature in one earlier, and that you're kind of pleading

604
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:16,000
that well, you know, we need to have an objective morality, like it would be terrible if we didn't.

605
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,680
So, you know, there needs to be some objective form of justice. And then, you know, they could

606
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,720
come in with the evolutionary psychology and that kind of thing and say that these are just

607
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,640
adaptive behaviors and whatnot. And you're trying to abstract that into something objective.

608
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:42,160
Yeah, right. Well, the Plato is moralizing is very different from deontological moralizing.

609
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:48,720
It's really like a statement of the matter of fact, like the way that Plato disproves

610
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:55,760
Thrasomachus' claim in the Republic that justice does not always align with individual advantage

611
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,160
that actually sometimes like its base to be just because you're just following basically

612
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:05,200
falling for the slave morality of your time instead of like transcending and looking after

613
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:12,640
your own individual benefit. But so you get down to an analysis of what exactly is meant

614
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:20,640
by advantage, what is meant by the good of a particular actor. And the so an issue with

615
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:26,720
platonic definitions, because he presumes there is this realm of stable archetypes out there,

616
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:33,600
then we should be able to cut up our definitions to correspond to these like consistent features.

617
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:40,960
And justice, for example, he defines in terms of the alignment of the three aspects of the soul

618
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:49,040
where you are in charge of your lower nature. So platonic reasoning in the dialogues is often

619
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:53,440
kind of messy because he's appealing to the particular preconceptions of the people that

620
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,960
he's interacting with. That's like Socrates' Mayutic method. He takes people from where they are,

621
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,920
uses the concessions that they make from their current state of knowledge and then draws them

622
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:09,360
kind of upward from there. And so you don't get these like apodictically certain perfect

623
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:18,320
demonstrations in the dialogues, more like what Aristotle sometimes aims at. But yeah,

624
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:26,400
so this definition of justice just eliminates the possibility that you can be benefited while

625
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:32,480
being unjust. Because like, do you care about your possessions? Do you care about your body? Or

626
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:38,960
do you care about the state of your soul? All other mental states, whether pleasant or painful,

627
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:45,360
depend on that configuration of soul in the first place. And if you accept that there is a best

628
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:52,640
state of soul, to facilitate your own kind of proper enjoyment, which I think everyone accepts,

629
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:59,840
there's like preferable mental states, preferable ways of thinking that lead to greater happiness,

630
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:07,600
then justice is going to be the way to attain that unity within yourself. So it's really that

631
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:14,320
he's giving a theory of what justice is, where these notions come from, because it can't be

632
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:19,120
convention all the way down, right? It doesn't make sense. Again, going back to like an evolutionary

633
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:25,920
context, in the set of all possible worlds where societies evolve, there are going to be stable

634
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,960
structures that equate to some underlying feature of the nature of reality, and then there will be

635
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,320
unstable structures. When evolution gets it right, when social evolution gets it right, and morality

636
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:43,840
equates to this dharmic structure, which you could say is the kind of archetype standing behind the

637
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:48,800
particular instantiation when it gets it right, it's stable. When it gets it wrong, it fails.

638
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:57,920
So justice is a more claim of like a matter of fact, not we should have this, but you won't be

639
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:03,600
happy unless you are just, and justice means each part of your soul doing its proper business,

640
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:10,960
right? So if you don't accept that, then the claim will be that you will just suffer as a result.

641
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,160
It's not that you need this justice, it's that you don't know what advantage actually is, and if

642
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:20,480
you studied it methodically, and really evaluated what you mean by what is good for you, like if

643
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,000
you want to make a consequentialist argument against Platonism and say that it leads to too much

644
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,640
extraction, and actually it's not going to help your nation. Okay, well, what is going to help

645
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:34,560
your nation? What is advantageous for your nation? That is a philosophical question that you can either

646
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:40,000
presume that you already know, or you can investigate it. And if you investigate it, the

647
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,920
contention would be if you properly investigated it, you would eventually come down to this

648
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:52,080
Platonic theory of value of the good, of justice, of these particular moral qualities that people

649
01:10:52,080 --> 01:11:02,560
instantiate. Yeah, I don't really understand the argument that, you know, that evolution

650
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:08,960
would kind of necessarily, that it would end up aligning our moral sensibilities with,

651
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,240
you know, what's what's deramik, or what's objectively right?

652
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:22,400
Right, well, the claim would be that there has to be an equivalence at some level, or correspondence,

653
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:30,480
let's say, between the features, the objective features of reality, and the states that an

654
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:38,000
evolutionary system takes up. So if you are not in line with the nature of reality, you're obviously

655
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,960
going to make mistakes, right, your knowledge will not be well grounded, your behaviors will

656
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:50,400
not be adaptive, adaptive behaviors will survive in a greater number of contexts overall than

657
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:56,240
unadaptive behaviors. So it's perhaps, it's not right to say that evolution leads to

658
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:05,280
moral perfection, or, you know, correct moral behavior all the time. But in order to survive,

659
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:10,560
there has to be some correspondence between the way you're behaving and the structure of reality,

660
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,920
right, your karma, individual conduct is tied to the dharma of your society, which is tied to the

661
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:23,440
art or underlying nature of physical reality. These have to correspond, right, and particular

662
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:31,040
evolutionary states will accord with that like proper dharma, or they'll deviate from it. And

663
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:36,560
the claim is, if you deviate from that proper dharma, from that like stable evolutionary condition,

664
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:43,920
then you're going to be selected out eventually. Yeah, I just don't see how that leads to

665
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:52,800
an argument for, like, an objective justice and morality within that, because, you know,

666
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:58,480
why can't it just be like adaptive behavior all the way down, right? Why does there have to be

667
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:03,520
any objective content to, you know, the good behavior that results from that?

668
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:11,360
Well, what's objective in it has to do, again, with that structure of underlying reality.

669
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:18,960
So because there are only so many viable states, an evolutionary system can take up

670
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:28,320
and survive, that constrains the range of what is going to be considered adaptive.

671
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:36,880
That what is adaptive is tied to the nature of reality at base. Now, you know, couldn't it be

672
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:43,200
that what led to thriving, what led to survival of evolutionary systems had no moral content?

673
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:47,760
Well, the definition of morality we're coming up with here has to do with

674
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,320
advantage, not evolutionary advantage, primarily. I mean, primarily, we're looking at

675
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:57,920
individual experience. And when we talk about the benefit of individuals, it's in phenomenological

676
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:04,160
terms, whereas in populations, we're talking about the benefit in genetic terms, you know. So

677
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:09,680
it's kind of taking it out of its proper context. But we're saying, like, the claim is that what is

678
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:17,200
adaptive is simply what's right. At the level of evolutionary systems, that applies, like,

679
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:22,080
the proper Dharma is going to lead to flourishing of your community. And there is a proper Dharma,

680
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:27,280
there is a way of doing that. So that's objective. Right. And then also at the level of the individual,

681
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,600
if you think that you can reject the platonic concept of justice, and you can,

682
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:37,280
and temperance, and you can let appetite run out of hand, and not rein it in with reason,

683
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:41,920
and that'll be successful. Platonists would just say, no, you're just wrong. You're not going to

684
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:48,800
be successful if you do that. So morality is, like, tied to advantage. That's the step that

685
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:54,000
Socrates takes in reasoning in a few different dialogues, including the Alcibiades, which my

686
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,880
reading group just went through. Does that make it any clearer? I mean, to work out the apparent...

687
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,760
Well, it's just as soon as you tell it to what's adaptive, can't you just get really

688
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:12,640
consequentialist about that? And, you know, maybe torturing babies from the other tribe

689
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:19,440
is most adaptive for our immediate benefit, right? I mean, it just seems like as soon as you tie,

690
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:26,960
as soon as you try and tie an objective good to what's adaptive, it just seems like, you know,

691
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,360
everything is in flux at that point. Yeah, if you kept, that's why I mentioned this kind of

692
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:37,920
distinction between evolutionary benefit, which is itself based on abstractions, like the gene

693
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:44,000
itself is an abstraction. There's no single material entity that equates to a gene. The gene

694
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:51,360
is defined differently depending on the context in evolutionary biology. So genes are an abstraction

695
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:57,520
already. And the kind of evolutionary context is within a set of mental parameters of human

696
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:03,680
theory, right? The reality is more well integrated than that, right? The individual morality component,

697
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:10,080
the well-being of the soul of the creatures in these populations also factors into adaptivity.

698
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:17,680
So our reductionistic material description of what is adaptive is incomplete. And like, you

699
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:22,880
can't just think of morality in terms of evolutionary benefit. You also have to integrate it with the

700
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:30,720
well-being of the individual soul. And I think what gets the, like, what is objective there,

701
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:35,760
and not just hedonism, is where you get into this idea of the independence of the soul,

702
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:41,200
making arguments for the fact that the human being is not the body. The human being isn't even the

703
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:47,920
combination of the soul and the body. The human being uses the body to do his work. We could run

704
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,080
through different thought experiments. We can demonstrate that. Plato has several arguments,

705
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:56,800
but once you accept that the human being is the soul, and if you accept that the soul is

706
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,880
immortal, which many people don't today, right? Because they haven't really dealt with this

707
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:06,800
concept sufficiently, in my opinion. You know, I have my own arguments that I've developed. Plato

708
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:14,480
has arguments. But once you take that step, then the consequences go beyond just an individual

709
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:22,880
life filled with hedonic experiences. It goes into the structure of the soul that you are

710
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:30,160
building through your action. And I think just empirically, that comes across in what makes

711
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:35,520
people successful. Like, people who simply pursue immediate pleasure, if that's our concept of

712
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:42,320
advantage here, are generally less happy on the whole than the people who structure their psyches,

713
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:49,280
who like, do hard work to enforce justice in their own soul. Those people, whatever happens,

714
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:55,840
they will be more resilient. Because the way that you experience whatever happens in the

715
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:00,960
mundane world is filtered through the structure of your psyche. And so if you can build a positive

716
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:06,640
structure into yourself, align the structure of your mind with the structure of reality,

717
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:12,480
like through this logistic on through like logos guiding the rest of your activities,

718
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:18,000
then you'll just be more content overall. It doesn't have this kind of ultimate moral force

719
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,200
unless you speculate about consequences after death. And that's why like, all of these facets

720
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:32,640
have to be combined in order to make sense of Plato's equivocation between advantage and justice.

721
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:38,720
So basically, when people make the claim that in any particular case, what is really just differs

722
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:44,080
from what is really advantageous, that's evidence for Plato that you just don't actually understand

723
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:52,320
what justice really is or what advantage really is. Right. So there's, there's no like,

724
01:18:53,120 --> 01:19:00,320
Kantian idea that, you know, there's no like contrast between doing what's right and doing

725
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,800
what's good for yourself. In a way, like you're always kind of pursuing your own good when you

726
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:11,680
pursue the good. But so just back to the idea of the forms, right. So the way you were kind of

727
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:17,200
speaking about the merrier and when you kind of contrast it with Aristotle. So it sounds like

728
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:21,760
you do have kind of a view of like, so there's like, there's, you know, there's different

729
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,480
interpretations of Plato, but there's a kind of two worlds interpretation of Plato that the forms

730
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:34,960
exist in like another realm, so to speak. The book I'm reading currently is a book called

731
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,520
Thinking Bean by Eric Pearl. You actually passed me on the recommendation from someone else,

732
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,400
but he basically totally rejects this and says that this is a bad reading of Plato.

733
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,920
And that in a way, like the way we commonly interpret Aristotle, he kind of attributes

734
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:55,600
that to Plato and he says that Plato and Aristotle didn't really disagree at all on the nature of

735
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,400
the forms. And then this passed on to Plotinus and Thomas Aquinas. He says there's like a

736
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,360
kind of a straight thread the whole way through. But it's sort of like the way you were talking

737
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:12,160
about the forms that you do accept more of like a sort of two worlds interpretation. So like,

738
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:17,280
what is the nature of the forms? Are they on kind of a higher level of reality?

739
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:23,040
Yeah, I would say they are on a higher level of reality, but it's not two separate worlds. It's

740
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:31,200
more like the world branches from a root in the one, and then through the highest level

741
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:38,400
categories and forms and the gods also and Plotinism, and then through specific differentiated

742
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,640
structures. I would say if you're going to have a rational model of the world, it's going to have

743
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:52,000
to look something like this with unity at the top to explain generic similarity of higher level

744
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:59,360
features of reality, and then descending through particulars to more contingent, less ontologically

745
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:07,040
fundamental aspects of the world. So our world here is less fundamental than those highest level

746
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:13,680
features of the world. I mean, any particular state of a system is less ontologically fundamental

747
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:19,280
than the syntactic arrangement of that system itself, the laws of the syntactic medium. That

748
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:25,520
has to be prior. Particular states of any system are inconceivable unless there's some kind of

749
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:35,120
previous order to the syntactic medium in which those states subsist. So it's not exactly there's

750
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:41,920
two separate worlds. It's that there is, I mean, ultimately kind of one fundamental reality,

751
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:48,960
the one contains the rest of being and the separation and distinctions that we observe

752
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:55,440
are perspectives on that being and don't have a kind of fundamental independent ontological

753
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:02,240
existence. You know, our perceptions now aren't fundamentally grounded in the way that the one

754
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:11,040
is. Like obviously, it's inevitable that we exist, we are here, but are in order for our being to be

755
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:16,560
there higher level features have to be the laws of physics have to be there. You know, other features

756
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:22,080
of the world, the nature of soul in general has to be there, like a particular soul can't exist

757
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:28,320
unless the structure of reality is such that this nature of soul does actually subsist in some way.

758
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:34,000
Otherwise, what is that soul that we're talking about the ontology will have the only alternative

759
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,240
is to make a totally bottom up ontology. And then once you take that step higher level theorizing

760
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:47,760
really just becomes impossible. And it's not that like I rule out on foundationalist grounds,

761
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,480
that kind of inductivist bottom up approach, it's that it's never been demonstrated to build a

762
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:58,160
comprehensive model and Platonism has, you know, like Plato, for example, said the world may be

763
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:06,080
in the shape of a dodecahedron. And, you know, in 2003, French team, analyzing, you know,

764
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:11,040
the background microwave radiation imaging said that, you know, you can make sense of

765
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:15,840
certain patterns in the background radiation by saying that the universe actually has the shape

766
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:22,960
of a dodecahedron, or like the idea of the platonic solids providing a groundwork for the

767
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:29,280
five elements in the Temaeus, you know, the tetrahedron being equivalent to fire and so forth.

768
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:37,760
Well, the platonic solids do come up in particle physics, because that is the only possible shapes

769
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:44,000
for the wave function of electrons in their orbits, for the wave function to kind of wrap

770
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,480
around nucleus of an atom in three dimensions, the only possible shapes that can equate to the

771
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:57,120
peaks of the wave functions have to be the vertices of platonic solids. And so like this method of,

772
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:03,520
you know, assuming real ontological status to these higher things allows you to build a rational

773
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,640
system with explanatory power. It has like, it worked for live nets, it worked for people who

774
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:16,080
have done serious work. And this, the alternative, a totally flux based bottom up irrationalism,

775
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:22,640
whatever, can't do that. Nobody's ever done, nobody's ever built the complete system without it.

776
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:26,800
And you can reject it on pragmatic grounds alone by saying, okay, well, what are you going to build

777
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:32,160
with it, man? Like, you have to build a complete theory in order to compete in this world, not to

778
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:37,680
bring it all down to the pragmatic justification. But what's that? Did I answer your question or?

779
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:46,480
Yeah, so, so my understanding of the forms is that, you know, in Platonism and Aristotelianism,

780
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:52,320
the certain point is that being is intelligible. And so there's, there's no,

781
01:24:53,280 --> 01:25:00,640
you know, there's no like ultimate duality between subject and object and, you know,

782
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:09,280
knowledge in the world. So the forms basically are the intelligible aspect of reality. And so

783
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:19,280
they're more real than sensible objects. So sensible objects aren't a lesser copy of an invisible world.

784
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:25,680
But it's basically like degrees of reality, going from absolutely nothing

785
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:33,920
to pure ideas, which is, yeah. Yeah, am I am I getting that right so far?

786
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:39,120
Yeah, I think probably a part of it is the language that the Greeks used for these different concepts,

787
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:44,800
like all elements of the spectrum have reality. There's I mean, reality is kind of like a binary

788
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:50,640
thing. It's either real or not. So degrees of reality doesn't make a lot of sense. But degrees

789
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:57,520
of essence does make sense, right? And essence is the word Usia in Greek that is often translated as

790
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:03,280
being misleadingly in English. And so this leads people to thinking that there's only one, you

791
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:09,200
know, real being. And this is all just fake, like the world's fake, then that's not what it means.

792
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:14,800
It's that the realities here are contingent on higher realities, they don't have self-subsisting

793
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:22,640
essences, which is the definition of a new sea, right? So yeah, in essence is one example of this

794
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:30,880
kind of metaphysical framework that the Platonists generated that can be helpful in thinking about

795
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:36,240
these things, just like Aristotle's category categories are helpful for thinking about metaphysics.

796
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:40,160
And also if people think that, you know, you don't have to replay them, you can't like evaluate,

797
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,920
you can't, or rather you can evaluate this stuff based on a couple of people talking about it.

798
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,040
It's ridiculous. Do your dang homework and go and like learn the foundations of Western philosophy,

799
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,840
because you can't cram it in there and then like think you're going to understand it.

800
01:26:53,840 --> 01:27:00,320
But this system was built out of metaphysical distinctions. So you have energy or energy

801
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:06,240
equated to activity, which is dependent on essence. So that's one kind of metaphysical

802
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:11,360
relationship of contingency there. And essence is associated with particular energies.

803
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:18,000
And then the energies of that being, you could break down into the different powers of

804
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:26,000
capacity and actual behavior. And then above the essence of a thing, there is its hypothesis,

805
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:32,320
the summit of its essence, which is the kind of existence, qua existence of that thing.

806
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:39,200
And these words have meaning, these Greek terms actually do make sense in terms of like just

807
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:45,120
the way that Aristotle's categories make sense of things. So it helps you make sense and it allows

808
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:49,360
you to build up this comprehensive system. So you, I mean, it kind of makes sense that if you're

809
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:54,080
going to be a Platonist, you have to take these terms seriously and really investigate what they

810
01:27:54,080 --> 01:28:00,640
truly mean. So the idea of an essence or an Ussia is tied to the idea of a definition, right?

811
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:05,920
So that's why in in Platonism, you'll often hear the idea of something beyond being, right? The

812
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:11,840
Henads, the gods or the one itself is beyond being. What does that mean? Well, they're beyond essence.

813
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:16,880
So it's misleadingly translated into English as being, but it really means Ussia or essence,

814
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:23,440
which has to do with like defining features of that thing. And it's not only defining features,

815
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:30,400
but a set of defining features that is self-consistent and kind of self-grounding in a way, similar to

816
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:37,040
the idea of an integrated information theory in, well, IIT, which is a modern theory of mind.

817
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:41,120
I think it's basically the leading theory of consciousness out there. It's the one I subscribe

818
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:50,160
to. And you can basically equivocate between an IIT and an Ussia. So it's a particular kind of

819
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:56,880
structure that has ontological self subsistence. That's what a soul is. That's what forms have.

820
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:03,280
And then beneath the level of soul, material things aren't IITs. They're not integrated

821
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:08,000
information systems. They're incomplete and they're ontologically contingent on more fundamental

822
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,960
realities. Those more fundamental realities being souls and then intellects slash forms and the one

823
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:22,960
itself above it all. Yeah. So in this book, I'm reading Think and Beans. So he says that

824
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:29,040
he thinks forms has kind of been badly translated. And he says that the ways used

825
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:39,760
in the original Greek is very similar to a word like appearance. And that basically he's getting

826
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:48,080
the forms there. He says that this word is used a lot in Aristotle and Plato, like the

827
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:59,440
wattness of sensible things. So sensible objects are appearances. But it's like the reflection

828
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:06,320
of Socrates. In a sense, you would say that is Socrates. But it's like a lesser reality

829
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:13,280
than Socrates himself. And so as you move up levels of reality, you could go from like

830
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:22,000
inorganic objects to creatures that have a consciousness, that have

831
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:31,280
a level of intellect. And then you could go to humans that can think more abstractly. And so

832
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:39,840
the hierarchy that presents itself in being is going to more intelligible forms of being.

833
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,200
Basically, his argument is that the whole of classical philosophy,

834
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:53,040
the basis for metaphysics at a certain point is to be intelligible and that there's no

835
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:59,280
distinction between mind and reality. And so you don't get something like idealism or

836
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:07,440
materialism. Because being is just that which appears in awareness, it appears in thoughts.

837
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:15,280
So it's always an intelligible reality. It's always rational. And thinking is always thinking

838
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:22,160
of being. He actually thinks that phenomenology lines up quite well with classical philosophy

839
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:29,920
actually. But what I find interesting about it is, he basically says that this is what you

840
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:35,680
need to understand as the whole basis for classical philosophy, Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Aquinas,

841
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:40,000
that the whole basis for it is this idea that to be is to be intelligible,

842
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:45,840
that there's no distinction between subject and object. So basically, he would place the beginning

843
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:53,760
of modern nihilism at the rejection of this idea. And he says that it's one or the other. Either

844
01:31:54,480 --> 01:32:01,280
being is intelligible and to be is to be intelligible, or else you can't do metaphysics

845
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:06,640
and you just have to be a skeptic and ultimately a nihilist. So he says the basis for nihilism

846
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:11,760
is rejecting that certain point of to be is to be intelligible. So that's a very,

847
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:16,320
you know, that's something I guess discussed a lot as well is like, what's the, you know,

848
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,600
where did it all go wrong in the West kind of thing, these kinds of discussions of like,

849
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:25,120
well, when did nihilism sit in, you know, was it Christianity? Was it Plato himself?

850
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:32,240
Was it scientific revolution? And you kind of to very different perspectives when it comes

851
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:36,880
to Platonism, because so in the case of Eric Pearl, who obviously respects Plato, he'd say that

852
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:43,440
and that losing that starting point of the harmony between thinking and being

853
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:48,800
that that gives you nihilism, because then you've no basis for any metaphysics or any objective

854
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:55,840
claims. And the post liberal theologians who get discussed in these circles sometimes would say

855
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:02,240
that, you know, with dynamicalism crisis, where we lost the sense of, we lost the belief in

856
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:08,560
universals that once we abandoned that, that God became this kind of arbitrary thing, you know,

857
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:13,840
you didn't really need God, because a lot of the justifications of classical metaphysics disappeared.

858
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,600
And the idea that there was an objective good, you know, the good just became like completely

859
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:25,600
contingent on God's will. But then it's like, when when you adopt that worldview, you kind of,

860
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:31,040
you're kind of already adopting, you know, 90% of what is like a modern sort of

861
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:36,880
relative worldview, but you just still have this entity of God, who has kind of an arbitrary

862
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:43,200
will. And it's like, at a certain point, you know, you've no need of that extra hypothesis.

863
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:48,560
So the post liberal sort of strand of thought that's quite popular now, especially

864
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:55,200
among some of the Catholic intellectuals, is that, you know, nominalism, which is the same thing,

865
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:00,800
kind of a rejection of Platonism, that that's the root of modern nihilism, and of the modern world.

866
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:06,880
And then that's, that's completely contrasted with like, these sort of, oh, sorry, I'm getting

867
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:12,960
a scout call right now. That's completely contrasted with like the Heideggerian view,

868
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:18,240
which is basically that everything went wrong with Plato. And Plato was the beginning of modern

869
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:24,960
nihilism. And it was precisely because of this attempt to kind of subdue reality and subject

870
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:29,760
reality to thought and to reason. And as soon as we started doing that, it kind of, you know,

871
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:36,080
it was the beginning of this kind of technical way of viewing reality where we try and, you know,

872
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:41,440
we try and abstract it, we try and bend it to our will. And that we, you know, we should be

873
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:46,800
approached in being more as a mystery, more as a poet than a philosopher. So you have two like

874
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:56,240
diametrically opposed views that the problem is that we are presupposing this unity between

875
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:04,400
intelligibility and reality versus, if you don't have that, the only option is nihilism.

876
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:09,840
So yeah, I'm just kind of spitball now, but I'm just curious what you think of that kind of

877
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:15,520
debate around the root of nihilism and what you think Platonism can tell us about that.

878
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:24,400
Yeah, I sighed much stronger with the post-liberal theologians and I think the beginnings of

879
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:30,240
nominalism, you know, like maybe a lot of the client of the West actually can be pinned on

880
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:35,520
Peter Abelard and the fact that he couldn't like keep it in his pants and then also his disrespect

881
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:43,680
of existing scholastic methods, you know, is kind of, and I wouldn't say that Peter Abelard

882
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:50,480
was a full-on nominalist yet, but like I think in his conduct, in his life, you can see just a

883
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:58,800
discontent, a desire to move beyond the limitations of his time and yeah, this like overwhelming

884
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,320
hubris. So I think a lot of it comes down to moral failures, you know, it's not so much

885
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:08,400
an intellectual current specifically, it's like there's always been this option available to

886
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:16,720
people to reject Dharma, reject the law of their society as sacred and inviolable and to try to

887
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:23,440
kind of cut their own path and use whatever sophistical justifications they can come up with

888
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:28,400
to that effect. That's the behavior of a lot of the Sophists in the dialogues. So they were,

889
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:34,080
there was already nihilism, you know, before nominalism and certainly before Plato. So you

890
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:38,320
can't blame it as a phenomenon entirely on Plato. You also can't blame the rationalism

891
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:43,680
entirely on Plato. With anything, Plato brought, I mean, Plato wasn't a rationalist. He completed a

892
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:49,920
rational system that was around in his day and harmonized with it rather than like completely

893
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:56,160
dismissing it, but then he went beyond it, beyond rationalism to kinds of mysticism,

894
01:36:56,160 --> 01:37:01,680
including mystic practice that guided the spiritual development of high antiquity,

895
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:08,880
you know, for 800 years and led to the invention of mathematics, you know, building of

896
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:14,880
Roman architecture. You don't have the academy and, you know, all this stuff. You don't have

897
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:19,120
Archimedes. You don't have Roman engineering. You don't have all this beauty that we associated

898
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:23,520
with the classical world. And Plato is responsible for that. He's not responsible for

899
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:29,200
rationalism as such. And also, okay, Heidegger, like, what do you want exactly? Do you want us to

900
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:36,000
see the efficacy of mathematics, see what it can actually do, and then just say,

901
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:41,760
yeah, but it's a bad idea. Don't mess with it. That seems to be his approach to technology,

902
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:47,280
generally, but it's like the philosophy of an ostrich, like putting your head in the sand

903
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:53,280
and thinking that that'll allow you to kind of avoid the structural elements underlying

904
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:58,560
reality that these rationalistic philosophers are trying to tease out. And certainly, that kind

905
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:08,240
of rationalistic vein can lead to a feeling of alienation, but only if you hypothesize the wrong

906
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:14,640
entities in your theories, you know, like materialism, hypothesizing crude matter and putting it as an

907
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:20,320
ontological fundamental without even having a good definition of it, like that produces alienation,

908
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:25,360
not through rationalism, but from a failure of establishing a well-grounded rational system

909
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:30,080
philosophy. And I don't know a lot of Platonists who have, like, nihilistic tendencies,

910
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:37,920
and you can't pin rationalism on Plato. There was already rational philosophy going on

911
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:44,320
in the Eliatics with Pythagoreans, with the Ionians. So you can't just put it back in the

912
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:51,280
bottle either. It's like, this is a mode of human consciousness that had an advantage in its time.

913
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:57,680
You know, the Greeks didn't discover a lot of principles in astronomy, or even, I mean,

914
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:02,480
they ended up discovering a lot of principles in geometry, but as of the 6th century BC,

915
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:08,400
it was mainly the Egyptians responsible for knowledge in geometry, the Phoenicians responsible

916
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:14,960
for knowledge in astronomy, and the Greeks emulated what they knew, but then found that,

917
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:21,200
you know, there was no ground for that knowledge. The Egyptians grounded it in, you know, revelations

918
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:26,160
from Toph, right? The Phoenicians were not sure how they grounded their knowledge in astronomy or

919
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:30,480
whatnot, but, you know, it didn't work for the Greeks who didn't believe in the Phoenician gods.

920
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:38,880
The Greeks, once they received this knowledge, practical, rational demonstrations, or sorry,

921
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:44,480
rational tools, basically, from the Phoenicians and the Egyptians, they had to ground why they

922
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:48,880
worked themselves, and they came up with this deductive method, and that's the distinguishing

923
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:55,120
feature of Greek civilization. They systematized deduction, right? Aristotle gets credit for

924
01:39:55,120 --> 01:40:02,480
logic, but like dialectics, logic existed prior to Aristotle, and it's what led to what gave the

925
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:08,240
Greeks their advantage, these new ways of thinking. It led to advantages in law, right? Plato was an

926
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:13,280
innovator in law, his ancestor Solon was an innovator in law, partly because through their

927
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:20,880
emphasis on deductive methods and like really analyzing justification in declarative speech,

928
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:28,240
they just, you know, they moved to a new mode of thought, and it's not fair to pin that on

929
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:33,920
Plato. Plato tried, once this new mode of thought emerged, he tried to harmonize it, he tried to

930
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:40,720
put it in its proper context and use it, and like in our position today, you may not like technology,

931
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:45,440
but if you just become, you know, a hermit in the woods, you're out of the game, you know,

932
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:52,080
you're not going to do any good for the world just because you have this antipathy to technology,

933
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:56,720
and that's mainly the way Heidegger seems to talk about it, and I haven't read Heidegger in years,

934
01:40:56,720 --> 01:41:03,200
but like neither Nietzsche nor Heidegger, in my opinion, offer like a substantive argument

935
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:08,400
against anything that Plato's saying. At best, you get this kind of, but I don't like it point,

936
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:14,640
which is ridiculous, and as far as like modern nihilism, you know, Nietzsche himself is responsible

937
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:19,120
for a lot of people taking nihilistic turns, but mainly the nihilism in the modern world,

938
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:26,080
I think. Partly it's nominalism, but partly it's just the failure of Christianity in our

939
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:32,080
civilization, so we had a metaphysical foundation and it was lost, and now what goes in that hole?

940
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:36,320
That's really the sort, that's where you get nihilism. People don't have a groundwork for

941
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:41,120
morality. I think the average atheist, or just anyone who isn't a Christian, basically in our

942
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:45,840
societies, if they say they're a moral realist, they probably don't even have very good arguments

943
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:53,280
for it. You know, you need a system underlying your civilization to make sense of metaphysics,

944
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:59,120
ethics, epistemology, what grounds claims, like all of this stuff needs to be there to have the

945
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:06,400
whole moral structure operate, and like we undercut the foundation of our system, of our OS in the

946
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:11,280
West, and so of course you're going to get nihilism. Blaming on Plato is just kind of ridiculous.

947
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:20,640
Yeah, I think the high-deagorean critique could be applied to like Cartesian philosophy

948
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:28,160
and a lot of modern metaphysics, but yeah, I really don't think it applies to like classical

949
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:32,480
philosophy or medieval philosophy at all, because you know, that idea that it's like

950
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:38,800
autonomous reason trying to subdue the world. Well, I mean the, you know, most of classical

951
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:47,680
philosophy, like Platonism kind of ends up with a kind of apophatic, like ineffable source of

952
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:56,080
being, you know, neo-Platonism kind of starts and ends in mysticism. You know, philosophy was

953
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:03,600
considered the handmaiden of theology in the Middle Ages. You know, so the idea that like

954
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:10,640
it's kind of speculative reason trying to present like a perfect sort of rational system of reality,

955
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:17,280
again, I think that's like maybe a fair criticism of some modern rationalist philosophy, but I think

956
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:23,040
if you try and put that back onto Plato, I think you kind of missed America. I think you're missing

957
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:31,200
something that changed, you know, after Descartes and after the Scientific Revolution. So yeah,

958
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:36,640
I think that misses America. And that's, again, I'd recommend that book by Eric Perlis. It's very

959
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:41,440
expensive, it's drawn by a hard copy of it, but I'm sure you could find it, but you know, because

960
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:49,120
he shows how, you know, a lot of these problems that we associate with modern nihilism and with

961
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:57,040
the way that philosophy kind of lessens the world in terms of, you know, creating dualities like

962
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:05,040
the mind and the world and subject object and kind of skepticism about epistemology. A lot of this

963
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:14,400
was kind of solved by the platonic view of the world. And so yeah, the idea that metaphysics kind

964
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:20,000
of inherently desacralizes the world. I don't think that's true at all. I think Platonism is

965
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:29,520
is very much a counter to that. Maybe I'll just answer a couple of super chess just so we're not

966
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:37,840
super pushed for time at the end if I read them. Sorry, one second. Hunter Stern said thoughts on

967
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:46,960
Hennosis. Unification. Can you explain a bit what Hennosis is? Yeah, so the Hennads are the unities

968
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:53,200
in, well, I think the distinction is first made explicit in Iambicus, but Proclus makes it a

969
01:44:53,200 --> 01:45:01,040
complete system. I have to explain a lot of, like, Proclus metaphysics here. I do incidentally have

970
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:08,080
a roughly four and a half hour video describing every one of the propositions in Proclus'

971
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:14,800
elements of theology. It's more condensed than reading it itself, but it's a bit tough. I'm

972
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:19,280
in the process of editing it. But anyway, that might help some people get the full picture if

973
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:25,280
they can put up with like four and a half hours of, you know, pre-scholastic Neoplatonism. But

974
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:37,600
the idea for each realm or hypostasis of being, there is the one exemplar of that realm, and then

975
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:46,720
this exemplar emanates imitations of itself. If it didn't produce the example, like the one itself,

976
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:52,160
for example, if it didn't give off likenesses, then it would be inert and it wouldn't be as

977
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:57,280
great as it could otherwise be. And for other arguments, we have to put goodness in the place

978
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:03,200
of this kind of ontological first principle. And so in each category, you have like the prime

979
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:11,120
intellect, for example. The hypostasis of intellect is also being life intellect. So the prime

980
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:17,120
intellect is technically being itself, Lucia itself, the archetype of all Lucia. A lot of

981
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:21,760
technical details in this that I probably don't need to go into. And then soul, there's like one

982
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:28,400
RK of all souls, the monad of souls, and then a declension through imitation, through likenesses,

983
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:35,520
moving into greater diversity and lesser powers. So in that first hypostasis of the one, the one

984
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:41,840
gives off Henads, which are often equated with the Greek gods. And they are super essential. They're

985
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:48,560
beyond intellectual definition. You know, this Eidos being translated from, or etymologically linked

986
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:52,960
to the idea of a look, I think is appropriate. All of this can be interpreted phenomenologically,

987
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:59,680
like Eric Pearl does. I think that is totally appropriate. But there's an element of phenomenological

988
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:05,440
reality that is definitional, well-defined, intellectual, strictly speaking, formal. And

989
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:11,680
then there's something beyond form, right? Form doesn't make sense unless form is contained

990
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:18,400
in a transcendental unity. So unity is higher than the application of form. And so we were

991
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:23,200
received through participation, our particular characteristics from the universals that we're

992
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:30,400
partaking of at that level. So soul receives from hypostasis of intellect through participation.

993
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:37,680
We receive unities, our unification of ourselves and unity with others through

994
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:44,000
genosis, which is a higher energy than the energy of the forms, strictly speaking.

995
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:49,120
Well, that's something I wanted to ask you, actually, about in terms of what's beyond the form.

996
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:56,880
So what's the status of the good in Platonism? Is that kind of outside of the forms? I mean,

997
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:01,040
that seems like one thing that there's an awful lot of debate about in terms of interpreting

998
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:05,120
Plato. It seems like there's an awful lot of different interpretations of exactly

999
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:08,720
what the good is and how it fits into his philosophy.

1000
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:14,640
Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Sucipus, the direct successor to Plato in the Academy,

1001
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:20,240
seems to, and there are very fragmentary remains of his work, but he seems to have rejected

1002
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:26,480
the Platonic account of the one in the good being the first principle. Aristotle, when he talks about

1003
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:32,480
Plato's hidden doctrines, I think, includes the good and the one in the definition of that kind

1004
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:39,680
of first principle according to Plato. But I take, and when I read Plato and when I read Proclus,

1005
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:47,680
I mean, it's, Proclus justifies his positions in his commentaries extensively through quotation,

1006
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:52,800
and I mean, he's pretty compelling making his case that this is actually what Plato thought.

1007
01:48:52,800 --> 01:49:01,280
So I lean towards like the Proclus was right school of Platonic interpretation. So yeah,

1008
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:06,800
the good is the same with the one. And this is informative for us because we can kind of

1009
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:14,000
define the nature of goodness through the nature of unification. Anecdotally, it kind of corresponds

1010
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:19,680
to what we think of as our well-being. Like someone is in a bad state mentally when they're

1011
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:23,440
at odds with themselves, when they have inner conflict, when they're not unified,

1012
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:29,040
cognitive dissonance is uncomfortable, whereas harmony and unification in the mind is positive,

1013
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:34,640
or our bodies suffer pain when they're disconnected. You know, if you tear a ligament,

1014
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:38,320
it's not a good feeling. If you're more well integrated, you allow yourself to heal,

1015
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:47,120
then you become more unific and better at the same time. So all union, qua union is a good

1016
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:55,120
because the good and the one are one, in my view, in the way that I see things. But yeah,

1017
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:59,840
that's above the form. So you have the good and the one, and then peros and apairon,

1018
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:04,640
or the principle of limit and unlimited, which are also super essential. And then you have the

1019
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:11,040
head adds, the species of unity, which are equated to the Greek gods often. And then you have the

1020
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:16,720
realm of being, life, intellect, the realm of forms in that second hypostasis.

1021
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:23,680
Okay, what about, you know, we hear about the, you know, the tree transcendental is true beauty

1022
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:29,920
goodness, but it seems like the good has a, an especially unique place and play those philosophy,

1023
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:35,920
but what about beauty then? So beauty isn't just beauty isn't is the form is that something

1024
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:43,520
forms as well. I believe. And so part of the system, like the general principle, once you

1025
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:47,120
want to accept, there are forms, you have to kind of put them in their proper taxonomy. And

1026
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:51,760
that's a lot of the work that neoplane necessary engaged with. So I can't remember where I read

1027
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:58,880
it, but somebody calls beauty like actually the chief form. I don't know about that. Exactly. I

1028
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:02,880
don't know precisely where to put this idea of beauty, but it's certainly in the rumble forms.

1029
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:12,000
Okay, that's interesting. Because there's also, I forget that it was at the Tabungan school,

1030
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:18,240
like there's there's this German school of interpretation of Plato that, you know,

1031
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:23,040
to summarize really simply, I guess they, they said that there's like, there was

1032
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:28,720
an unwritten doctrine of Plato that was preserved through some other people and that you can find

1033
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:33,360
from from oral accounts and so on. And if you put it together, basically, it looks remarkably

1034
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:40,160
similar to what we would call neoplatinism, like platinus. And if they're correct, then, you know,

1035
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:46,880
if you add in like the kind of oral teachings of what how Platinism was taught and the unwritten

1036
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:53,040
doctrines, then there's actually very little difference between Plato and platinus. So yeah,

1037
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:58,160
well, what do you think of that interpretation in terms of what we're missing from the dialogues

1038
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:04,800
that's kind of necessary to make sense of Plato's metaphysics that was likely there that we've missed?

1039
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:11,680
Yeah, I basically agree with that school of thought. When I read the dialogues before I had

1040
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:18,160
read neoplatinism, as I said before, I interpreted it in in terms of Advaita Vedanta, and I saw no

1041
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:25,040
real conflict there. So I mean, I do see Plato as a kind of monist, you know, maybe not, you might

1042
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:32,880
say he's like a qualified non-dualist, perhaps rather than like unqualified monism or monism,

1043
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:42,560
whatever. So yeah, platinus, I don't agree with on everything some of his doctrines.

1044
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:49,200
Proclus disagrees with, I tend to side with Proclus on those, like for example,

1045
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:54,720
platinus, when looking for a principle of evil, goes to matter itself. Whereas,

1046
01:52:55,760 --> 01:53:00,800
you know, for Proclus, matter is the lowest entity ontologically, the most contingent,

1047
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:06,480
most dependent entity, least productive itself, but it's not a principle or archaic evil. For

1048
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:13,760
Proclus, there isn't an archaic evil. So platinus can lead to this more like mannequin view in some

1049
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:21,760
ways. So yeah, I mean, I would see platinus more as like an unqualified non-dualist. Proclus and

1050
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:30,000
Plato would be more, you know, qualified non-dualists. But I do see an essential continuity there,

1051
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:35,600
for sure. And again, like people, if you want to argue that Plato wasn't a Pythagorean, it just

1052
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:39,360
seems to me you can't have actually read through the dialogues. Because many of the characters

1053
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:45,040
who are most respected, Parmenides, Zeno influenced by Pythagoras, maybe not technically Pythagoreans

1054
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:51,200
themselves, but Timaeus in the Timaeus is Pythagorean. And then if you look at the roster of the first

1055
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:56,320
students in Aristotle schools, his school was effectively a Pythagorean school. I think the

1056
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:02,000
mainstream consensus among scholars is that Plato was a Pythagorean. And there was a Neo-Pythagorean

1057
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:07,840
tradition that kept running all the way through until the beginning of Neoplatonism. And there's

1058
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:14,080
also more continuity between Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism, I think, than many people suspect.

1059
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:18,720
It's just that not as many of the writings of the Middle Platonists survive. And I don't,

1060
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:23,040
I haven't gone through all of them, like I need to read Plutarch's Moralia, which isn't all about

1061
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:27,360
morals. A lot of it actually has to do with, like, more Platonic cosmology and metaphysics.

1062
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:33,760
So I'm curious what, you know, I respect Plutarch's sense of style, at least, from his biographies.

1063
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:40,640
But yeah, he had some Platonic doctrines to relate to his own in his day. So I, yeah, I think an

1064
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:49,920
unbroken line of Pythagorean slash Platonic influence is the way to interpret these philosophies,

1065
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:58,000
their antiquity. Although, yeah, there were innovations in Neoplatonism. But there's so

1066
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:04,800
much in the dialogues that it's often possible to kind of go back and interpret even things that

1067
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:11,360
seem to be very late additions, you know, like this dichotomy between the one and the hen ads,

1068
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:17,040
but within the first hypostasis, like that's a kind of proto-scholastic fine distinction that

1069
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:22,640
doesn't seem to be there in Plato. But, you know, if you read carefully enough, like Proclas tends to,

1070
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:28,080
maybe you can see a justification. So I would say overarching continuity with some development,

1071
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:30,480
especially in late antiquity.

1072
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:37,360
All right, I want to ask you as well about Plato's conception of God. So obviously,

1073
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:45,040
in the Tamaeus, he puts forward this idea of a demiurge that created the world according to

1074
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:52,480
mathematical principles, but it's not the kind of God of classical theism, right? He's a creator

1075
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:58,160
God, you know, he has a bit more agency. It's not the kind of ultimate transcendent sort of

1076
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:08,160
apophatic being that we might be used to Platonists, you know, how to describe God in theology. So is

1077
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:14,800
there like two gods in Plato? Is there the demiurge and a more sort of transcendent classical

1078
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:23,920
conception of God? Or, you know, is the good something that is kind of above God in that sense

1079
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:28,400
as the ultimate principle? Or, you know, are we to understand that as it relates to like classical

1080
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:37,120
theism? Right, if we're going to go with Proclas again, then there will be a relationship of the

1081
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:43,600
one and the good to the Greek gods that equates to the relationship between the monad of like,

1082
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:51,040
say, triangularity to all particular triangles. So the monad of Henads is the one itself, and that

1083
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:55,760
because of that, we can call that the first God. Proclas does in the elements of theology,

1084
01:56:55,760 --> 01:57:02,400
call the one itself the first God. So in that way, you could say, I know, Proclas would identify as

1085
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:09,040
a polytheist, but you kind of say there's a cult monotheism there. But anyway, so you have that

1086
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:15,680
kind of divinity beyond participation, pure unity. Like, and things don't directly participate of the

1087
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:22,320
one, they participate via intermediaries, the one remains in itself, never affected by what's

1088
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:27,680
outside of it, but containing everything outside of it, always from eternity, emanating out copies

1089
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:33,040
of itself. And then we participate of those unities. Now, the demiurge is at a lower level.

1090
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:39,680
He's not even the summit of the second hypostasis, which is being as such, the chief among

1091
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:47,040
intelligibles. And being has to be superior to intellect, because intellect aims at particular

1092
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:53,840
beings. Intellect isn't like, it only makes sense if it has a target. And because something that is

1093
01:57:53,840 --> 01:58:00,080
aimed at a target is subordinate to its end, right, it is trying to get to its end, it can't be the

1094
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:06,320
ultimate thing. So intellect is not ultimate. In that second hypostasis, being that the principle

1095
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:13,600
being being itself is is preeminent. But so you have the principle being the principle of life,

1096
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:20,080
and then the principle of intellect. And that that member of this, this set here would be where you

1097
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:26,640
find the demiurge as such. And his peculiar feature is that he's the intelligible intellect. So

1098
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:33,840
within intellect, you have a spectrum of the chief intellect, and then subordinate imperfect,

1099
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:39,680
less complete intellects declining from there. In the demiurge himself, his objects of

1100
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:46,560
intellection, what he's looking at with his intellect is one in the same with his essence.

1101
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:53,680
So he contains all the forms in in himself, all intellects contain all forms, but in different

1102
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:59,680
ratios. So like the form of, I don't know, say a triangle again, or whatever, will contain in some

1103
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:05,120
sense, seminally, all the other forms, but it will emphasize the one that is its peculiar identity.

1104
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:10,560
What's unique about the demiurge is that he contains all the forms unfiltered in himself.

1105
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:16,080
And his act of creation is also kind of similar to the way that the one creates. He remains in

1106
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:22,400
himself. And through his self contemplation, generates these likenesses that then as intermediaries

1107
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:26,400
kind of do his work. So there's actually not just one demiurge. There's a whole

1108
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:34,160
series of demiurgic intellects, which engage in the fabrication of the world in Platonism,

1109
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:46,160
or according to Proclus at least. So yeah, it's so in some ways, like the demiurge in Proclus

1110
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:52,720
looks like God in Aristotelianism, you know, for Aristotle, God is thought thinking itself,

1111
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:59,680
and that is kind of what the demiurge is. It's the prime intellect as such, reverting to itself,

1112
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:04,560
and intellect is an essentially revered function in each of these, just to kind of

1113
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:10,320
complexify it a little bit more, in each of these hypostases, there is abiding, progressing,

1114
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:15,840
and reverting necessarily. So each moan out of a series, for example, abides in itself,

1115
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:21,680
progresses to its last members, and reverts to itself. So intellect in the being life,

1116
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:27,920
intellect hypostasis is the revered function. Being is abiding, life proceeds, proliferates,

1117
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:35,120
differentiates, and then intellect in gathers and brings back, you know, what was disseminated.

1118
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:41,600
So the demiurge is that chief of the revered, revered of function in gathering everything in

1119
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:48,160
the realm of forms, and then through that kind of emanates the lower realms of reality beneath

1120
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:58,240
himself as his product. Yeah, the, the idea of like, positing two gods or two natures of God is

1121
02:00:58,240 --> 02:01:03,520
actually, you actually see it crop up again and again, like, again, Alfred North Whitehead

1122
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:08,080
theorized that there was like an imminent and a primordial

1123
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:15,120
nature to God, that there was a, you know, God as he acts in the world, and sort of directs,

1124
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:22,560
you know, the concrescence of the world versus the God that kind of, because Whitehead kind of

1125
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:27,600
was a Platonist, he's presented as like a process philosopher, but really I see this like updated

1126
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:31,920
Platonism, but you know, then he had the primordial aspect of God that he needed to pause it to like

1127
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:38,480
uphold the, what he called them, eternal objects, which are basically his version of

1128
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:44,880
Platonic forms. But it's kind of, maybe this is, you could tell me if this is a good analogy, but

1129
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:49,840
you know, in Hinduism and Vedanta, they have the idea that, you know, there's Brahman, which is

1130
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:56,080
obviously the complete ineffable source of everything that, you know, apophatic

1131
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:03,680
descriptions apply to, but then as it concerns the world, Vedanta actually has like a kind of a

1132
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:09,520
second God, which is more like the kind of personal, theistic creator God that they call Ishvara,

1133
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:16,240
and they say that, yeah, that you have to have, you know, that that's basically Brahman's interaction

1134
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:22,640
with the created world, like somehow generates this like absolute mind. So would you say it's a

1135
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:29,600
fair analogy that like Demiurge is like Ishvara and Vedanta, and then the Platonic idea of the one

1136
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:32,800
is, you know, could be equated with like the Hindu idea of Brahman?

1137
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:43,120
Yeah, unqualifiable, yes. Okay, that's interesting. And another thing is, would you say then that the,

1138
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:51,120
from a Platonic conception of things, does the good have any creative power? Like,

1139
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:55,760
I know that might sound like a weird question, but I've been, I've been reading this book. It's

1140
02:02:55,760 --> 02:03:00,880
very interesting called Universes by John Leslie. I don't know if you're familiar with it. But he

1141
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:05,440
basically argues for a modern version of the defined union argument, which I do find very

1142
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:11,200
convincing. You know, just take a modern physics, things like the cosmological constant. And

1143
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:16,320
you know, I'm sure you're familiar with like the kind of modern updated version of it. But then

1144
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:22,320
at the end, it's kind of interesting. So he's not committed to any religion. But he thinks the

1145
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:28,720
fine tune in argument basically is a convincing argument for God. And it's a much better argument

1146
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:32,800
to multiple universes. But then at the end, there's an interesting chapter where he's speculating,

1147
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:39,920
well, okay, what, what created this? And he says that he finds the Platonic answer

1148
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:46,480
the best. But the way he presents it is that the universe came into existence because it was an

1149
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:52,240
ethical good that it would exist. So that's, I mean, that's kind of a, the way we're used to

1150
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:56,240
thinking in Western philosophy, I think that's kind of a, that kind of hits you as a very left

1151
02:03:56,240 --> 02:04:04,640
of field idea that somehow something being good itself, like gives itself creative power,

1152
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:11,280
like because it was good that the universe would exist. That goodness itself created the universe.

1153
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:16,720
It's a very strange idea, but he says that this is like a platonic conception of the good. So

1154
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:19,280
yeah, I'm just curious what you think of that.

1155
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:30,480
Hmm. These arguments, like, basically pre Anselm ontological arguments are found in Neoplatonism.

1156
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:38,080
I don't, I've never really liked ontological arguments. I do side with Schopenhauer on that.

1157
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:45,120
So it's, it's difficult. You know, in some ways, I'm kind of like getting into Neoplatonism just

1158
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:48,560
in the last two years. I read Plato, you know, many years ago, I've always considered myself

1159
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:53,680
a Platonist, but I never really took the literature seriously and tell more recently. So I can't,

1160
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:59,600
I can't speak like in specificity on, on precisely that point.

1161
02:05:00,640 --> 02:05:08,800
But I mean, does Plato suggest that the good has some, has some creative power? Like, is it just

1162
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:14,160
this, you know, because when you think of the good, it's this kind of static, you know, unchanging.

1163
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:18,080
But the idea that it could have like creative power to generate the universe,

1164
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:22,800
Leslie calls that a Platonic idea. That's a, it's a very different way of thinking about that,

1165
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:31,360
isn't it? Yeah, I mean, there is, there is talk of like the generation from the one in the good.

1166
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:38,400
The question is like, how do you justify that argument? Right? One argument that Proclas makes

1167
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:42,880
is similar to a kind of ontological argument where, you know, once we've identified

1168
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:49,120
the first principle as the good, and his, I could go through his arguments for why,

1169
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:55,600
but they're a little bit convoluted. But anyway, once you get that identity of the first principle,

1170
02:05:55,600 --> 02:06:03,760
then okay, what is better, something being inert and static, or something overflowing itself and

1171
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:08,560
having abundant infinite powers? Well, clearly the latter, right? Appealing toward intuitions.

1172
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:13,440
So I haven't really seen like an excellent argument on that point. I have my own way of

1173
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:19,120
thinking about it, which has always been like the kind of ultimately permedean, more this is

1174
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:27,200
where the monism really comes in or monism comes in, where the one is inconceivable unless it subsumes

1175
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:32,720
the rest of reality anyway. And then the description of reality being emanated out of it is really

1176
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:40,720
just a factor of like limitations and separations being temporarily imposed through perspectives

1177
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:45,600
on this one, so that you're never outside of the one, the one has to contain everything.

1178
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:50,320
But in another manner of speaking, we can say it has to overflow itself and create likenesses of

1179
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:57,600
itself. But like a pure one, a pure simplicity is inconceivable outside of the categorical

1180
02:06:57,600 --> 02:07:02,960
distinctions that we use to arrive at the notion of simplicity, like the simplicity, complexity,

1181
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:09,760
dichotomy is built into our minds. And so we can't think simplicity without complexity. And so you

1182
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:15,360
can't put forward a hypothesis of the first principle of being that is this perfect simplicity

1183
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:21,200
with nothing else involved. No matter what, you're always kind of just leaving unspoken the rest of

1184
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:28,560
the categorical schema of like what exactly defines it as simplicity. Pure simplicity is completely

1185
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:34,880
ineffable, completely unthinkable, and doesn't make sense logically. But if you take this step to

1186
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:44,320
say that like everything is the same as simplicity at some level, a kind of holographic containment

1187
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:54,160
where complete undifferentiation is always and only at the same time, like all all differentiation

1188
02:07:54,160 --> 02:08:00,160
smushed into one. All differentiation has to be the same as the undifferentiated in a kind of

1189
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:06,000
paradoxical way. So this is obviously we're dealing with the very summit of, I would say being, but

1190
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:11,600
that's not strictly speaking correct, platonic terms, the highest level of reality. And so in

1191
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:18,080
mystical systems, in perennialist systems, there's always antinomy, seeming paradox, seeming contradiction

1192
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:25,760
because we've run up against the limits of dynoia, rationalistic thinking. We can't touch that element

1193
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:32,480
of reality through abstractions because they are inherently categorical, inherently relational.

1194
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:37,920
And so you can't express simplicity through relation, through a relational medium. The only

1195
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:43,360
mode of contact would have to be intuitive, which is why like the knowledge of this reality

1196
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:48,880
can only ever come down to us rationalistic philosophers from those who through through

1197
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:55,520
theology or yoga or whatever have made contact with that more unitive ineffable aspect of reality.

1198
02:08:57,280 --> 02:09:04,400
So does it make sense to say that? I mean, does it make sense to ask why the forms exist? Like

1199
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:08,960
is there any level of contingency or are they just absolutely necessary? Because like take

1200
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:15,200
like modern Christians, right? Like, I think William Land Craig argues that he believes in,

1201
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:23,520
you know, abstract objects, that numbers exist. But he thinks that it's a itself kind of an

1202
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:29,040
argument for the existence of God, but he also says that these wouldn't exist without God creating

1203
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:33,920
them, without God creating the laws of logic and numbers and so on, because he says that it's like

1204
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:39,440
it's a terrible limitation on God if you say that these, you know, numbers and abstract

1205
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:46,240
objects and stuff are absolutely necessary. Because, you know, that's that's there themselves

1206
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:53,200
kind of constraining God then. So like what's kind of a standard traditional like plateness

1207
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:57,680
take on that? Like would Plato have said the, would you have ever speculated about like why

1208
02:09:57,680 --> 02:10:01,600
the forms exist? Or would a plateness say that that's kind of a meaningless question?

1209
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:10,240
No, I don't think it'd be meaningless. I think they why they exist, you can easily justify on

1210
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:14,240
epistemological grounds, like theoretically, we have to postulate these entities to make sense

1211
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:19,920
of what we see. But like the bigger question of why they are there, you have to go to the higher

1212
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:27,520
principles beyond the forms have to be prolific themselves, or they would be not as good as they

1213
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:32,640
could otherwise be. So again, it's this kind of variety variation on the ontological argument

1214
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:38,320
that people keep falling back on here, which I'm not totally happy with. But I think one way of

1215
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:46,240
thinking of it is just that because creation from the one happens through similitude likenesses of

1216
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:53,120
himself, the forms inevitably reflect the nature of that kind of divine reality in itself. So it's

1217
02:10:53,120 --> 02:11:00,160
not it's not a matter of God kind of with like libertarian free will selecting, you know, how

1218
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:06,720
he's going to make the world. It's rather just the world and the forms are just an overflowing of

1219
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:13,200
divine power and are an expression of his nature. And so they're not arbitrary. They are the necessary

1220
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:20,720
ways that being must unfold. And that's like that raises kind of the ultimate metaphysical question

1221
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:30,720
that you could ask, you know, is ultimate reality necessarily one way? And does some being or

1222
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:38,960
super essential reality exert some kind of will over what the nature of that possible realm of

1223
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:45,280
being would be? For me, like, if if that's what you do, then you're nominalist, and ultimately,

1224
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:49,680
like, you're not going to be able to have rationalistic framework, you can always take that

1225
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:54,480
step theoretically. But the worldview that comes out of that won't have the same advantages that

1226
02:11:54,480 --> 02:12:00,880
a worldview based on necessity has. And, you know, necessity just in Greek mythology, and in most

1227
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:07,200
traditional mythological systems is placed above the gods. So the way that the forms are the way

1228
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:12,080
all these subordinate levels are have to just be reflections of the nature of the divine ultimately.

1229
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:18,080
All right, I'm going to get to some more to super chats. George Wright said,

1230
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:22,720
when translated and played with Christianity, does the one correspond to the father and

1231
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:30,400
Logos, the son? Logos, Jesus is Logos in the Christian interpretation, isn't he?

1232
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:35,280
Yes. Yes. I don't know about the father as one of you.

1233
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:45,600
No. I mean, if anything, the father in Judaic theology is more like the Demiurge, yes.

1234
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:54,720
And Logos, I mean, the Logoi are principles within soul, like Eidos is the formal principle in the

1235
02:12:54,720 --> 02:13:03,120
realm of forms. Logos is, I think, peculiar to the level of soul, but I could be wrong on that.

1236
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:08,880
It's kind of a technical point. Just actually seen as that came up, the Demiurge, the Old Testament.

1237
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:15,200
So how influential was Platonism on Gnosticism? Did they get the idea of the Demiurge direct

1238
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:23,520
from Plato? Yes, for sure. Of course, like the pessimism of the Gnostics, they did not take

1239
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:28,320
from Plato. Plato was really, I think, more like Leibniz, where Leibniz thought that we have the

1240
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:34,160
best of all possible worlds, very anti-Schopenhauer in that way, or not in line with Schopenhauer's

1241
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:39,760
views. But yeah, the world denying isn't really there in Plato. I mean, he acknowledges that

1242
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:44,640
there are better places to go, but he also acknowledges that the world is a beautiful place

1243
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:49,840
and is created by it. Plotinus wrote a big screen against the Gnostics, didn't he? Yeah,

1244
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:57,680
right, which I haven't read in a long time. But yes, so I do think they got that idea,

1245
02:13:58,320 --> 02:14:04,080
the Gnostics did. Also, it deserves mentioning it's this guy, Russell Gmerkin, has a very

1246
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:09,440
interesting hypothesis about the origin actually of the Old Testament as we've received it.

1247
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:14,880
Sorry, what's that name, Russell? Russell Gmerkin, G-M-I-R-K-E-N, I think.

1248
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:24,080
So apparently, there isn't a shred of archaeological or textual or cultural evidence at all of the

1249
02:14:24,080 --> 02:14:31,280
Old Testament prior to 270 BC. And that's when the Septuagint Bible is translated. The translators

1250
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:37,040
of the Septuagint Bible were Hellenized Jews living in Alexandria. They translated it in the

1251
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:42,160
Library of Alexandria where there were obviously tons of Hellenistic texts, including Plato.

1252
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:50,160
And Gmerkin just kind of traces all of these parallels between conventions in Greek literature,

1253
02:14:51,360 --> 02:14:56,720
Greek legal conventions, like the idea of a constitution is uniquely Greek. The ancient,

1254
02:14:56,720 --> 02:15:01,760
like the Code of Hammurabi is there as a set of laws, but Near Eastern societies didn't invent

1255
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:06,720
the Constitution. And yet there are constitutional elements in the Old Testament and in Greek

1256
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:13,440
law, and then also like particular prescriptions that Plato offers in the laws, especially in the

1257
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:23,520
Republic. And it just looks like the people who translated the Sanhedrin Bible were actually

1258
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:29,840
drawing from a set of their traditional scriptures and put it together in line with Hellenistic

1259
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:38,640
philosophy and especially the advice of Plato, which if true would be hugely significant. I mean

1260
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:46,320
obviously, I think Gmerkin has a couple interviews on YouTube and I've read some of his more recent,

1261
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:50,880
he has two books on this, I read some of the more recent book. And it's definitely an interesting

1262
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:58,640
hypothesis. Well, Nietzsche said Christianity was Platonism for the masses. So if Gmerkin is

1263
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:05,920
correct, then that was doubly true. Yeah, that's interesting. And then when the Gnostics criticized

1264
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:11,600
the Christians, or sorry, when the Neoplatonists criticized the Christians for being a historical,

1265
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:17,600
well actually, it might be because the Jews themselves invented this fake history on the

1266
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:22,080
advice of Plato, as he says in the Republic, you have to believe that your institutions are ancient,

1267
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:28,080
etc. And that's what the Jews who followed Plato's advice did. And so that would be like the whole

1268
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:34,720
Testament, like back to Moses and Abraham. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there would be certain

1269
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:39,120
scriptures that already existed, like the Book of Job, most people think is actually ancient

1270
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:45,680
from like 11th century, or sorry, 11th, you know, 11th century BC, or thereabouts,

1271
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:52,480
there are precedents in Near Eastern literature from the 800s, 700s, the lament literature that

1272
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:58,240
like the genre looks similar to the Book of Job. But yeah, as far as the system goes that Pentateuch

1273
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:05,440
the Mosaic Law, all of this stuff, and it fits with the higher criticism, like the author that's

1274
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:12,320
called like the Deuteronomist, who's the latest author who really puts together like the Deutero

1275
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:19,520
canonical formalization, and that system of law that would have been under Gomerkin's hypothesis

1276
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:24,880
created during this translation of the Septuagint around 270 BC.

1277
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:31,920
Right, that's very interesting. Yeah, I've bookmarked his Wikipedia, so I'll definitely check

1278
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:38,560
that out. Hunter Stern said thoughts on the Straussian hermeneutic of Plato.

1279
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:42,160
I don't know Strauss, so.

1280
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:51,920
Yeah, Strauss has this interpretation that, you know, you have to have like an esoteric

1281
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:56,240
interpretation of every philosopher, because they have to write in a way that doesn't,

1282
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:00,720
that Plato came to this realization with Socrates that, you know, you have to present

1283
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:06,160
version of your philosophy that won't upset the social order, and then one that can be

1284
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:11,040
read esoterically. But I haven't read a lot of Strauss readers, so I can't really say it that

1285
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:16,320
much. I mean, I agree with that. There's definitely the esoteric divide and Platonism.

1286
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:25,120
Yeah, he thinks that's like, he also thinks there's an esoteric message in Plato, like specifically

1287
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:31,440
about that, you know, as discussions of Socrates and stuff, like the role of the philosopher

1288
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:39,920
as it pertains to the social order and trying to translate truth in that context. But yeah,

1289
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:44,640
again, I haven't read a lot of Strauss, I can't really say anything too interesting on it.

1290
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:53,680
Eton Vac said, Ervol speaks a lot about Platonic metaphysics, forms, etc. Okay, this is quite a

1291
02:18:53,680 --> 02:19:00,000
big question. One, how do you assess Plato's political philosophy strictly? Two, how much is

1292
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:05,680
Plato's political philosophy grounded in his metaphysics? And, well, I guess you can answer

1293
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:10,640
those first, and then I'll ask the other one, because it's kind of unrelated. Yeah, Plato's

1294
02:19:10,640 --> 02:19:13,840
political philosophy, it's kind of surprising we didn't cover that at all, actually, but

1295
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:20,240
right. Yeah, there's a relationship known for, yeah. Right, yeah, yeah. So the relation to

1296
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:24,640
his metaphysics, that's quite an interesting angle as it concerns his philosophy.

1297
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:31,680
Right, I mean, they're obviously intimately connected. I am a Platonist politically as well,

1298
02:19:31,680 --> 02:19:36,960
and Plato was an authoritarian. Basically, it's one big endorsement of paternalism.

1299
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:43,520
There is a hierarchy of souls, some souls know better. And if you don't know as well as someone

1300
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:50,400
else, like you should follow the people who know. Everyone's, this is like a proceless idea,

1301
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:58,080
everything's proper perfection is to be found by following, like in the train of its whatever

1302
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:03,360
leads back to its proper cause. So the world is filled with these intermediary authorities that

1303
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:09,840
we always have to be appealing to, to integrate ourselves into a broader hierarchy. And I think

1304
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:15,920
that's basically the way and the model and the path. And I think in the 21st century,

1305
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:20,960
especially it's going to become more obvious that you can't have libertarianism culturally.

1306
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:26,160
You have to have some degree of paternalism. Now, there is a harmony that you can find between

1307
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:31,680
libertarianism and this more authoritarian paternalistic way, which is like, you can have

1308
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:36,960
independent kind of volunteerist societies that themselves internally operate on authoritarian

1309
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:43,680
lines. And that's ultimately the way that I go. But yeah, I don't really disagree with Plato at all.

1310
02:20:44,320 --> 02:20:50,240
The Republic is meant to be like an absolute ideal. There's a couple of things we know about the way

1311
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:55,440
he thought about this ideal state. One is that it corresponds to some kind of ideal form archetype

1312
02:20:55,440 --> 02:21:00,480
of political society that is there to be found by anyone. So Plato wouldn't have thought of himself

1313
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:09,280
as inventing this system, but rather discovering like the true, most true dharma of a society

1314
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:17,520
like his own. But then there's also a chart, sorry, just bear with me one moment here.

1315
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:26,320
Yeah, there. So it's an ideal, it's also in the Timaeus, we learn exactly the constitution

1316
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:32,960
and structure of ancient Athens. So in the Atlantis narrative, Athens defeats the

1317
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:40,400
Atlantean Empire. And part of why it's able to do that is because it had this best of all

1318
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:46,800
possible models of the state handed down directly by Athena. So it's given by the gods. It's also a

1319
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:52,720
form, perfect mode of government. And, you know, some of the particulars you could argue were

1320
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:58,880
having to do with the technology of this time and place. But by and large, the process is,

1321
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:04,800
I think, what needs to be there in political society, which is you need to get talent very early on,

1322
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:10,640
standardize certain aspects of education, especially like music, gymnastics, mathematics,

1323
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:16,160
like what we've basically done. Like a lot of philosophy of education over the centuries

1324
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:24,240
its origin to Plato's philosophy of education, and of Athens more broadly. You know, a lot of what

1325
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:31,360
Plato recommends in the Republic is just like, do what Athens does and this and this additional

1326
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:36,800
stuff. So yeah, I mean, I would consider myself a Platonist, basically, and it's tied to the

1327
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:44,000
metaphysics because that's what the guardians have to do. They have to be able to make contact

1328
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:48,880
once they've studied their mathematics, completed the rationalistic philosophy, learned all the

1329
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:54,400
mundane principles of government. Then, you know, when they're 55 and up, and they're at the real

1330
02:22:54,400 --> 02:23:00,800
head of the hierarchy, they can like make make that intuitive contact with the forms, you know,

1331
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:08,160
come to know the perfect state directly, and then come back down into the cave into the political

1332
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:14,560
society and enforce that. And unless for Plato, you have this caste, spiritually enlightened caste

1333
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:19,280
that can return to the higher realm in some form and, you know, make contact with that

1334
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:25,120
guiding principle or formal principle of society, then it'll break down. So they're definitely

1335
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:33,040
connected. All right, and the second part of that question was just, have you encountered

1336
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:35,120
tropes nominalism?

1337
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:46,480
No. Okay, yeah, I'm not very familiar with either. Just one other thing on that actually,

1338
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:53,440
again, it's quite a big question. But I mean, in terms of the Plato's approach to political

1339
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:58,320
philosophy versus Aristotle, I mean, what would you say is, is the main difference there? Is it

1340
02:23:58,320 --> 02:24:05,520
that Plato is more focused on, like, the perfect ability of people through the state in a way

1341
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:11,040
that Aristotle isn't, you know, he's more taken the kind of family is a starting unit, would you

1342
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:20,000
say that's a fair characterization? Plato certainly has more hope for the perfect ability of man,

1343
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:25,920
but people mischaracterize that and take it in this kind of communist or like new socialist man

1344
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:30,320
way in thinking that like everybody's going to be transformed. And Plato knows that's not

1345
02:24:30,320 --> 02:24:35,760
happening. Obviously, this is for the elite. It's for a small segment of the population to

1346
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:44,640
actually overcome these kind of egoistic limitations of everyday life and and make a difference.

1347
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:50,400
But anyway, Aristotle, I've read his politics, but I'm trying to kind of remember like where

1348
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:58,320
where he really situates like the highest form of government. I know he ranks, I mean, his ranking

1349
02:24:58,320 --> 02:25:07,200
is similar to that of Plato from the Republic. But do you recall like does he put aristocracy on top

1350
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:14,240
still? I don't know that he really like fundamentally disagrees. All that might mean he gets the idea

1351
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:19,760
like man is a social animal, you need this larger community, but that also it follows

1352
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:25,440
right in line with what Plato talks about in the Republic. You know, maybe there's

1353
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:32,480
more emphasis on kinship, but also Plato, like if bare minimum, people need to believe that they all

1354
02:25:32,480 --> 02:25:37,920
spring from the same ground, you know, they do have this blood and soil connection. So that's

1355
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:43,200
important mythologically for Plato, even if not like if it doesn't always have to be ethnographically

1356
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:48,880
true, for example, like the Athenian tribes were legal fictions and people more or less knew that.

1357
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:55,600
And yet Plato would endorse such tribal divisions, even if they don't come from an

1358
02:25:55,600 --> 02:26:02,000
organic source, they can still be useful for the state. Yeah, so I don't know, I would have to

1359
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:09,680
reread the politics to really make a robust comparison. All right. Hunter Stern said,

1360
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:14,480
is there any difference between Dugan and Urban Crystal both have their start in politics with

1361
02:26:14,480 --> 02:26:19,280
their own strand of Bolshevism, then through a schizo hermeneutic of Plato and onto influence

1362
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:26,800
politics? Well, they're political views are obviously quite a bit different, I would say.

1363
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:33,040
Sovereign Air said, you don't need to watch a video called the Athenian Revolt Against Babylonian

1364
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:39,920
Finance. I linked it, I think it's by that channel that used to be around vertical politics.

1365
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:44,480
Promise you won't be disappointed with the quality. He's one of the best creators,

1366
02:26:44,480 --> 02:26:50,640
not as official channel. All right, well, I'll check that out. But yeah, that's all the superchats.

1367
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:56,560
Yeah, did you have any other topic regarding Plato you wanted to cover?

1368
02:26:56,960 --> 02:27:06,960
I mean, I think basically, like the challenge for people is if you don't want to accept the theory

1369
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:13,360
of forms to explain how universals work, then you have a lot of other work to do in really making

1370
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:19,120
a robust nominalist system. I know that a lot of other professional philosophers are nominalists.

1371
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:25,040
I just don't think anyone can be a nominalist coherently. That's my case. That's what I defend.

1372
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:30,880
So a lot of it does come down to the theory of the forms, the idea of universals,

1373
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:37,280
what is the first principle of being? If it's not unity, if you don't go with Plato there,

1374
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:41,440
and you don't take that kind of monism, then what's your first principle? The question is like,

1375
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:47,840
here's this system. It is acted as the foundation of Western philosophy for more than 2000 years.

1376
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:51,760
People have built off it in thousands of different ways in different ages.

1377
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:58,480
And so if you're going to just say no to it, okay, man, now it's your turn. Now it's your turn to

1378
02:27:58,480 --> 02:28:03,760
build this system that's going to work for us as a foundation. And I don't see anybody coming up with

1379
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:09,680
anything like that. If perennialism is essentially true, there is one true philosophy, then you

1380
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:16,080
should expect the majority of the traditions out there will always be guided by a similar kind

1381
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:24,640
of basic set of beliefs. You see that in Hinduism, in Platonism, you see that hints of it in what we

1382
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:29,600
can gather of Indo-European philosophy. There are regional differences, of course, but I think

1383
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:35,120
that the basic truth, metaphysically speaking, of the world is there, and it's one. There is one

1384
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:41,280
truth of the world. If you say Plato got it wrong, then what do you put in its place? And like a

1385
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:48,000
reference to its flux or its ineffable or unknowable, that can remain a bare assertion,

1386
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,440
but it doesn't amount to a comprehensive worldview. And there are plenty of scientific

1387
02:28:51,440 --> 02:28:56,400
Platonists who have integrated modern theories, like there are Platonists working today,

1388
02:28:56,400 --> 02:29:00,880
integrating quantum mechanics, integrate information to people like Johanna Rottz,

1389
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:06,880
who I respect. I know that you know about these people are out there doing the work to build

1390
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:12,640
the new system that, you know, the equivalent of what Aquinas did in the Middle Ages, the equivalent

1391
02:29:12,640 --> 02:29:21,200
of what Plato and Aristotle did in antiquity. And yeah, there's just literally no alternative.

1392
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:29,120
So we've just read through the Elcibiades, and I think the basic point that is made there is,

1393
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:35,440
on the one hand, the nature of the soul. Where is our identity fundamentally situated? Do we

1394
02:29:35,440 --> 02:29:40,400
benefit ourselves by benefiting the body? Do we benefit ourselves by acquiring power? What's that

1395
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:46,560
kind of first principle? What do you do first? Like even if we agree that political power is good.

1396
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:51,920
Elcibiades, of course, is Athenian statesman. Bronze Age pervert mentioned him in his book,

1397
02:29:53,440 --> 02:30:01,200
Bronze Age mindset, as this Athenian statesman who like had influence in Athens, and then when

1398
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:06,160
they were going to arrest him at a certain point in time, defected to Sparta. And then from Sparta,

1399
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:10,000
well, he impregnated the wife of the king in Sparta. And so he had to leave and he defected to

1400
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:14,400
the Persians. And then from the Persians, he redefected to the Athenians who wanted him back

1401
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:19,040
because they thought like, wow, based, that's cool. And so he went back and then was kicked out again,

1402
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:23,920
and then eventually died in Turkey somewhere. So but he was like, you know, very guided by

1403
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:30,000
Thumos, very like martial spirit kind of character. And he wanted on his like 18th birthday, as soon

1404
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:34,160
as he was given full legal privileges in the state of Athens, he wanted to go into the assembly and

1405
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:39,200
like tell him what was what and what they ought to be doing with the state. And the whole dialogue

1406
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:44,400
is Socrates basically just saying, whoa, calm down, like, first of all, what are you advising the

1407
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:49,200
Athenians on? What do you know better than them that you can inform them on? And these are the

1408
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:53,040
sorts of questions that I think many people who operate in political spheres don't actually

1409
02:30:53,120 --> 02:31:00,560
fundamentally ask themselves, you know, what do I know better about how the state should be run?

1410
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:06,000
People presume that they know better, but often they leave these fundamental notions like justice,

1411
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:11,920
like advantage, like what is the soul, like these sorts of things, they leave them completely unanswered.

1412
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:16,240
And this approach of like starting in the middle with philosophy and starting with common notions

1413
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:24,080
and indefinable, you know, je ne sais quoi that is your identity and movement. Like, that's not

1414
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:29,440
been demonstrated to work. Historically, it's this Platonist approach, what Socrates advocates for

1415
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:36,960
Alcibiades like, no, first, take care of your own virtue, get grounded yourself, and learn the nature

1416
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:44,320
of reality. And then maybe you'll be in a position to to advise the Athenians and, you know, exert

1417
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:51,040
your influence on their on the Empire. But step one is like, Okay, prepare yourself. And I think

1418
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:57,040
Plato's solution ultimately is very clear. It clearly worked. It was building a school. And I

1419
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:01,760
think we we are in a similar position. We should do similar things. So yeah, I'm doing my reading

1420
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:09,120
group. We just finished Alcibiades. We're moving on to the Gorgias, starting April 16. We meet on

1421
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:13,520
Saturdays. People can join through the Patreon by recognizing that not everybody you can

1422
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:19,840
support it doesn't work for some people situation. So I have made quite a few exceptions for people.

1423
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:24,480
So basically, whoever wants to get involved, you can contact me on Skype or just join the Patreon,

1424
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:28,880
and I'll send you a link and explain how it works and stuff. But it's it's kind of just required

1425
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:37,120
reading. Like if you want to be more than just a commenter on current events, like if you really

1426
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:41,920
take the truth seriously, you want to have this holistic worldview. And I don't think our side,

1427
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:46,720
generally speaking, can win unless we have this comprehensive worldview supporting us, like you

1428
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:51,920
have to at least match the kind of thing the elites have produced. And by the way, the elites got

1429
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:58,800
way where they are by relying on their knowledge of Plato, they read Plato, you probably should

1430
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:02,800
do like it's kind of required reading if you want to have this comprehensive worldview, if you want

1431
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:06,800
to get to the bottom of things, get to the bottom of our civilization, all of this, you're going to

1432
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:11,120
have to do it one way or another. So you might as well deal with others. The dialogues can be a

1433
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:16,320
little bit difficult to read. There's often many layers of meaning that get lost. You know, I'm often

1434
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:22,480
kind of blown away by some of the Neoplatonic commentators when they like, excuse me, explicate

1435
02:33:22,480 --> 02:33:27,200
a metaphor that is there in like the setting of a dialogue, for example, and I just had no,

1436
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:33,600
no cognizance of it the first time reading through. So there's a lot in these texts, you know,

1437
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:38,720
they not only found provided the foundation of Judaism, Christianity, some of Islam,

1438
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:45,680
also Hermeticism, ancient occult traditions, Renaissance magics, like all occult traditions

1439
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:52,960
from Rosicrucianism to Masonry, like Mason still talk about Pythagoras and Plato, the all of these

1440
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:57,840
people who have controlled the world have built what they've built off of the back of Plato. So

1441
02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:04,160
even if you want to reject it, fine, first read through it. So, you know, I encourage people

1442
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:09,760
with dissenting opinions also to get in contact with me. If you think I'm totally wrong, then

1443
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:14,640
let's have a conversation about it, you know, take our time and really analyze what's being said,

1444
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:20,720
because kind of a motive just reacting against Plato, because like Heidegger doesn't like Plato

1445
02:34:20,720 --> 02:34:27,360
or whatever is just kind of childish, let's grow up and get our foundation set for putting ourselves

1446
02:34:27,360 --> 02:34:35,200
in the best path to victory, ideally. Yeah, your Ereval's channel link is in the description,

1447
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:40,880
so if you want to get in contact with them, I think you post your Skype and other links and

1448
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:45,840
stuff in the video so people can find you through there. Actually, one thing, the guy who asked

1449
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:50,000
about the difference between Irving Crystal and Dugan, there is actually a debate that's been

1450
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:57,360
done around again lately, where Dugan actually debated Bernard Henri Levy, who has a very similar

1451
02:34:57,360 --> 02:35:04,880
worldview to Irving Crystal, he's like a big apologist for neoliberalism and neo-conservatism,

1452
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:08,800
so you could just watch that debate if you want to see the differences in worldview.

1453
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:16,400
But yeah, just one other thing actually, I mean, I know you, as far as, you know, what you mentioned

1454
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:21,440
about the school and you think that we need to do something similar today in terms of bringing the

1455
02:35:21,440 --> 02:35:30,000
best minds together, creating like a comprehensive, coherent worldview, certain metaphysics that has

1456
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:36,880
like scientific insights. If I understand you right, you think that an advantage of this is

1457
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:45,600
basically, you know, who kind of wins in the social space is kind of decided by technological,

1458
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:53,520
scientific advances, you know, that's kind of how liberalism came to power. Like one question I have

1459
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:58,240
is like, you know, as far as that goes, I mean, if you were to bring kind of the best scientific

1460
02:35:58,240 --> 02:36:05,360
minds together and get a, you know, an excellent sort of theory of everything, isn't there a problem

1461
02:36:06,240 --> 02:36:13,360
in the modern world that like to translate that into power now requires such a massive

1462
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:20,160
sort of military industrial complex behind you. Like when, you know, the more things progress,

1463
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:25,440
like, you know, one time you could make a great scientific discovery with a telescope, right,

1464
02:36:25,440 --> 02:36:30,480
or a math equation, but now the way things are progressing, you need like the large hadron

1465
02:36:30,480 --> 02:36:35,760
collider for like billions of dollars, whatever that costs, and like a huge team of hundreds of

1466
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:41,360
scientists. So I don't know, that's a, that was a question actually in terms of like, you know,

1467
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:49,040
does having the truth, or does having a scientific insight really translate into power today if you

1468
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:56,160
don't have a huge state apparatus behind you to create a huge industrial apparatus to, you know,

1469
02:36:56,160 --> 02:37:00,400
carry out experiments and turn that actually into technology that could make any difference.

1470
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:08,240
Right. Well, on the one hand, it depends on exactly what this new

1471
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:16,480
philosophy worldview scientific paradigm looks like, because if it allows us to rediscover

1472
02:37:16,480 --> 02:37:22,240
the lost Atlantean acoustic limitation, you know, whatever they were using, then maybe it's something

1473
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:29,120
that's practical for people. That's obviously a stretch. But I think the more like direct

1474
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:36,320
path to victory by having an institution like this is using it as a framework for communities

1475
02:37:36,320 --> 02:37:40,160
to build new kinds of production chains. So rather than trying to like build the new

1476
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:45,280
high tech thing, you have to be vertically integrated and you have to start from the ground up.

1477
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:50,320
So you get this society together with the right worldview, and then you organize intelligently

1478
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:56,960
in paternalistic ways, and build out the production chains gradually. So the direct

1479
02:37:56,960 --> 02:38:02,880
application of this worldview is as an operating system for a social structure. And then you scale

1480
02:38:02,880 --> 02:38:09,360
that social structure by better management, by affordability, by offering like tangible material

1481
02:38:09,360 --> 02:38:15,120
benefits to people who joined your paradigm. And then gradually you have more communities

1482
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:20,400
involved, you have more people cooperating in your system. And then the end product of that

1483
02:38:20,400 --> 02:38:24,880
is some of this more high tech stuff that requires, you know, more capital investment.

1484
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:29,600
But I think the worldview doesn't, it's not that the direct output has to be

1485
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:35,120
the side beam cannon, right? That's like, there have to be several steps before you get to that,

1486
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:42,240
that end artifact. So yeah, if you have the right worldview, you can align values,

1487
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:50,400
you can get people cooperating, and then simply recruit, scale, and repeat until you have the

1488
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:58,400
resources you need to do whatever else you want to do. All right. Yeah, well, we're coming up to

1489
02:38:58,400 --> 02:39:02,960
two hours, 40 minutes. Yeah, I really enjoyed this talk. It was great to get you on. Like I said,

1490
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:09,120
I'm kind of immersed myself in Platonism again. And I feel like, kind of feel like I'm starting

1491
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:13,920
from scratch, because yeah, if you really get into it, you can realize that there's there's a lot of

1492
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:19,200
things you kind of took for granted, or you kind of gloss over some of the ancient philosophers,

1493
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:25,280
I definitely did. You know, you kind of like, well, my experience anyway, no, I found the

1494
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:30,960
just you feel like you there's like a sort of obligatory, like summary reading of them that

1495
02:39:30,960 --> 02:39:35,600
you have to do. And you just get the basics of them. And that's kind of it. So I found looking at

1496
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:39,760
like secondary literature. And like I said, I really recommend that book by Eric Pearl.

1497
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:45,760
You realize that it is actually a completely different way of approaching philosophy, a completely

1498
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:50,400
different way of thinking about the world. And you actually have to like set aside all your sort of

1499
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:57,040
modern prejudices in how you think about the world and how you approach questions about reality.

1500
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:02,880
And it's actually, you know, it has its own kind of feeling and logic to it. But then once you

1501
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:08,480
imbibe that, you realize that, you know, it's such a radically different way of doing things.

1502
02:40:08,480 --> 02:40:13,120
And it really does solve a lot of modern problems. So yeah, I think people should take an early

1503
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:18,000
look at Platonism and Ereval's channel is very good. I also shared, I know you promote them,

1504
02:40:18,640 --> 02:40:23,440
you interview them. I shared this channel on my Telegram. I'm forgetting the name,

1505
02:40:23,440 --> 02:40:29,600
is it like E.C. Winsper? Yes, that's it. E.C. Winsper. Yeah, I recommend that channel as well.

1506
02:40:30,320 --> 02:40:34,960
And you can find Ereval's interview with them where they have another discussion about Plato.

1507
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:40,320
But yeah, thanks for joining me, Ereval. I appreciate it. Thanks for everyone that tuned

1508
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:46,800
in, sent super chats. And yeah, potentially, I'll be back next week. I'm going to have

1509
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:52,960
Tyler Hamilton debating Adam Green on the historicity of Jesus in two weeks from now,

1510
02:40:52,960 --> 02:40:58,560
which I think will be an interesting debate. And yeah, that's all for now, everyone. So take care.

1511
02:40:59,440 --> 02:40:59,920
Thanks, Keith.
