{"text": " Alright everyone, so today I want to talk about this book called Platonism and Naturalism, The Possibility of Philosophy, by the Platonist scholar Lloyd Gerson. Now this is an interesting book to cover because this actually presents a very good introduction to Platonism, you know, Platonism as it's thought in sort of introductory courses and colleges and so on. We don't really get a full perspective on Platonism, right? We get what's sort of in the dialogues, you know, the Republic and Plato's ideal form of government and the forms and so on. But the kind of Platonism Gerson presents is, you know, Platonism as it was a school of thought. So, as well as what's in the dialogues, you know, there is a deeper sort of more esoteric reading of the dialogues and of Plato that includes Plato's so-called unwritten doctrine as it was taught to Platonists, it includes the testimony that Aristotle gave of what Plato believed. Plato also had a number of epistles where he further explained some of the sort of more esoteric elements of his thought and then of course there's the whole school of Platonism or what we call neo-Platonism, people like Plotinus and Proclus and that's often presented as kind of a separate school of philosophy, right? It's neo-Platonism. Something like Gerson would say, no, this is just Platonism and what usually separates them is, again, you know, Platonism we think of the forms, the separate forms, this world of forms and we think of neo-Platonism as this more kind of religious philosophy where the one is very central and it's this kind of mystical view of the world where everything unfolds from the one. Well Gerson argues that this was always central to Platonism, that central to Plato's philosophy is what he calls the superordinate idea of the good or the one and that Plato's whole philosophy is really built around this and a lot of scholars kind of missed this point and they have a much more sort of exoteric reading of Plato. Now this book is interesting because Gerson, as well as presenting the whole outline of the Platonist philosophy and given this deeper reading of Platonism, he actually argues that when we understand Platonism this way we begin to see that essentially philosophy is a kind of binary choice between Platonism and naturalism and we can actually read the whole history of Western philosophy as this conflict between Platonism and naturalism because what Gerson argues is that this whole system of Platonism, it all fits together, the key elements of it inform the elements and if any one of those isn't possible then philosophy itself isn't possible because without the Platonist viewpoint philosophy basically wouldn't have anything to tell us and we would just be limited to what science can tell us about the world. Now to back this up Gerson starts this book with a cover in Richard Rorty who's quite a well-known post-modernist philosopher and he's a good background to this because Rorty basically argued the same thing and philosophy in the mirror of nature, he argues that Platonism and philosophy are identical because if one rejects Platonism one has no specific knowledge to contribute. If you reject the tenets of Platonism you really can't claim that philosophy can tell us anything unique about the world. Although philosophers from Aristotle onward made philosophical criticisms of Plato, Rorty claims that they did so from a Platonic starting point they shared with Plato basic assumptions of principles, the questioning of which was never the starting point of any objection and so it is possible to read all of classical philosophy as this kind of dialogue within Platonism. Aristotle is a Platonist, of course you have the Neoplatonist when you have Christian philosophers, scholastics like Aquinas, they too are starting from these kind of Platonist starting points. Rorty maintained that the fundamental divide between Platonists, whether this is self-declared or not, and anti-Platonists is that the former believed that it's possible to represent truth in language and thought whereas the latter do not. Rorty is known for this book Philosophy in the Mirror of Nature and this is basically his argument, the argument of the post-modernist is that our thought can't accurately represent truth and that there's a fundamental divide between these and this is his rejection fundamentally of Platonism. Rorty says that Platonic thought is systematic, that is it believes it has a distinct subject matter. So what binds Platonists together is their belief that philosophy can discover unique knowledge and so this is the central question to this book and to this whole inquiry is does philosophy have unique knowledge, can philosophy tell us something about the world? And so we get to this conflict of Platonism versus naturalism. Gerson agrees with Rorty that Platonism just is systematic philosophy and this means that we can look at other systematic philosophers like Spinoza, Hegel or Leibniz and we can actually see them as constructing versions of Platonism. They have many of the same assumptions, the same kinds of conclusions and when we introduce this conflict of Platonism versus naturalism we can see that philosophers fall on some side of this divide and some try and kind of synthesize the two positions although Gerson, another one of his central arguments is that a synthesis isn't really possible. In the end you have to make your choice between Platonism or naturalism. So he says Platonism first came under attack from Christian philosophers who wanted to identify the first principle of all with the God of Scripture and so the kind of theism that would have come out of early Christianity would have been in conflict with the idea of divinity that's present in Platonism with the one but he sees the second wave of attack as more significant. Of course there's a conflict here but this is kind of remedied or synthesized by people like Thomas Aquinas and Saint Augustine. Eric Perl in his book Thinking Bean which we covered on my book club this year basically argues that Thomas Aquinas should be read as a Neoplatonist philosopher and that he really takes his whole philosophy of divinity and its relation to the world from Platonists and he synthesizes this with Scripture and with the Christian God but the second wave of attack is more significant. It comes into 17th century when Platonism which had by then become wedded to Christianity came under attack from naturalism and the history of philosophy since then has been various failed attempts in Gerson's opinion to marry naturalism and Platonism. So of course you know the 17th century we get the the scientific revolution the rejection of the kind of Aristotelian approach to nature and new philosophies and new defenses of forms of naturalism and then Gerson's reading of enlightenment philosophers like Hegel or like Leibniz is that they're trying to synthesize naturalism and Platonism trying to come up with some kind of middle position. And so the first part of this book Platonism and Naturalism is dealing with the important question of what actually is Platonism. As mentioned earlier there is a sort of standard introductory reading to Plato that Gerson feels misses a lot of important points so let's begin. Understanding Platonism requires historical investigation. Although there are historical divisions among Platonists the divisions occur under the umbrella of shared principles. Platonism is this school of thought that has worked out over centuries and there are many influential important Platonists and we have to look at the sort of dialogue between them and how that unfolds to really understand Platonism. Platonism insists on the distinctness of its subject matter which is nothing but the subject matter of philosophy. This subject matter is the intelligible world or what is available to thought as opposed to sense perception. This is a very important aspect of Platonist worldview is that philosophy has a distinct subject matter because it's concerned with the intelligible world and this is something that's separate from mere sense perception. Plato sought explanatory reductivism. He believed there were ultimate explanations for things that were as simple as possible. This explanatory reductivism is ultimately satisfied by the ultimate explanation of a superordinate first principle the idea of the good. Much modern scholarship on Platonism ignores how central this is to the Platonic system so as mentioned this is why the work of Gerson is really interesting is because he centers everything around the idea of the good and how central it is in Plato's system. The idea of the good or the one as it was called in later Platonism and this is in the dialogues but it's only pointed to in some brief passages so people really miss the importance of this in the opinion of Gerson. Platonism must also be understood as a rejection of philosophical precursors and specifically of materialism, mechanism, nominalism, relativism and skepticism and you see each of these positions represented by different precursors to Plato in the dialogues who Socrates argues with and these are the five Antes as Gerson calls them so in constructing this kind of Ur-Platonism in finding out what Platonism is he does this as a kind of negative inquiry where he says that it's a rejection of these five Antes and from this rejection you get the positive worldview of Platonism. The five Antes are firstly nominalism. Plato rejects nominalism which is the view that if two or more things are the same then they must be identical. Nominalism there's no conceptual space for sameness that is not identity. Essentially nominalism is the rejection of universals. It's a rejection that there are things common to things like you know redness or you know tuness that they're common to them but not identical so again it's essentially the rejection of universals. Materialism is the view that the only thing that exists are bodies that is three-dimensional solids and whatever supervene's on or is epiphenomenal to these bodies so this is obviously the dominant way of thinking about the world today with our sort of scientific view of things that it's just kind of matter and motion and these three-dimensional solids sort of slam together and out of that we sort of accidentally get complexity and this is how everything really is explained in a sort of scientific worldview. The third principle Plato rejects is mechanism which is the principle of causal closure it's the view that all causal explanations available to us are found within a naturalistic framework. Everything is determined by naturalist principles and there's no getting outside of this naturalist causal chain. He also rejects relativism which is the view that there exists no normativity independent of the interests or beliefs or desires of one or more human beings so we have no way to adjudicate any kind of moral judgments any kind of objective hierarchy of values it's all just subjective preference. Finally he rejects skepticism which is the view that there exists no infallible cognition and it's interesting or it's important to remember that all five of these aunties basically come about as a part of the naturalist worldview and in the view of Gerson if you are a naturalist you have to accept all five of these positions and so Platonism in rejecting and arguing against all of these is showing the untenability of naturalism. So if you're a naturalist if you believe that all there is is the objects of this world you would have to be a nominalist there's no space for something like the number four or the color red existing in some kind of ideal or conceptual space beyond its instantiation in the world. You'd have to be a materialist because again if you're a naturalist how can you posit some kind of ideal forms or substances beyond the things we observe in the world as kind of implied by naturalism. You'd have to accept mechanism because again what kind of things would play a causal role if not for things observed in the world in a naturalist worldview you would have to be a relativist because what kind of you know what kind of thing would an objective moral good or some kind of objective standard be that's not presented to us just by what we observe by nature that's something that comes about true cognition true value judgments and making that objective in a naturalist worldview is basically untenable. And we also see that naturalism often leads to skepticism I guess the best example is the philosophy of David Hume and you could look at someone like Rorty himself and this kind of skeptical attitude that if naturalism is true why would we suppose that our minds can access some kind of infallible cognition you know we are just evolved apes with brains that are evolved for survival rather than for truth and it would be a very strange thing if we had access to some kind of ideal space of objective truth. So Plato rejects all of these in his rejection of naturalism. Now what's also necessary to understand Platonism as well as the rejection of these five principles is Plato's explanatory reductivism. So throughout the dialogues a positive and systematic position can be sketched out in opposition to these views this is that was the negative side this is the kind of positive side of Plato. According to Gerson the central pillar of the positive construct on the basis of this foundation is clear and unambiguous it is an unhypothetical first principle of all called in the republic the idea of the good and according to Aristotle's testimony identified by Plato with the one. If Platonism doesn't have this systematic unity then the individual elements must fall apart. Each of Plato's arguments against his predecessors relies on the coherence of the other aspects of his philosophy and each relies on the explanatory role of the first principle of all. Gerson emphasizes this a lot that when people try to understand say Plato's view of ethics or his view on the forms or his view on knowledge something like this and they take this in isolation from the rest of his philosophy and even ignore something like the first principle of all the idea of the good that it starts to not make sense and it all becomes very kind of arbitrary so you have to understand this as a complete system there's an all or nothing binary between Platonism and naturalism either every element of Platonism holds up as a complete alternative or they all collapse and this is the central argument of this book it's one or the other it's Platonism or naturalism. Platonism and philosophy are identical if naturalism is true there is no role for philosophy. So now since we've constructed this binary between Platonism and naturalism it's worth looking at what actually is naturalism. So naturalism maintains that there is no realm or subject matter that is unreachable by the natural sciences specifically the realm of the immaterial. Now we should be well acquainted with naturalism today because it's really the dominant mode of thought when it comes to questions of philosophy you can think of like something like the New Atheist movement right people like Richard Dawkins are just preaching naturalism and kind of basic arguments for naturalism in the naturalist worldview but there are examples in antiquity of course there's the atomism of Democritus and Lucretius and the Stoics also attempted to synthesize Platonist and naturalist principles for example they accepted mechanism and materialism but they did maintain a kind of teleology in attempt to overcome relativism which we'll look at later. Modern naturalists often admit elements which naturalism cannot explain for example consciousness, intentionality, truths of mathematics but they either claim that these are a mystery or that they will eventually be explained by natural science. This is something that's probably become a lot more common in recent times is the naturalist kind of accepting the limitations of the naturalist worldview but saying look this worldview works it's better than any of the alternatives and we often get this extreme faith and kind of scientific progress where they don't really have a good account of something like consciousness but they put their faith that well eventually science will be able to explain all of these things not recognizing that sometimes there's a kind of qualitative gap to be bridged in explaining these things that can't just be explained by sort of quantitative additions to our knowledge through science. Gerson says quote my working hypothesis is that there is no stable rapprochement between Platonism and naturalism I'm certainly not alone in thinking that this is the case though I suspect that I would have more support in this thought from naturalists and from Platonists. If I am right then the possibility of philosophy understood as a source of knowledge independent of the natural sciences depends on a defense of Platonism. Platonism entails the subordination of the sciences but not their elimination naturalism entails the elimination of Platonism and so the elimination of philosophy. Now of course any discussion of Platonism has to include the forms and this is how we begin our explanation of Platonism which is a Plato posits the forms as explanatory entities. The theory of forms is supposed to explain identity and difference. How can numerically different things be the same? How can we say that two things are both red or both beautiful even though they're different? The relationship between sensible objects and the forms is one of participation for Plato so Helen participates in the form of beauty and so you can have multiple people participating in the form of beauty and so this is how many things can be the same. Because thinking and sense perception are irreducibly different the object of thinking is not a particular object of a particular sense but a form or structure of whatever it is that is also available to the senses. So this is what thought does uniquely is disability to kind of universalize things and forms are neither universal or particular. They're universal in relation to the thinker of the form and particular in relation to a particular object having an instance of the form. So the forms don't really exist this way it's often thought where there's this like world of forms where there's a perfect chair and a perfect circle and the perfect color red. They are both universal and particular so they are instantiated in the world but when we think them we think them universally. The forms allow for what Gerson calls non-exclusive predication allowing us to cognize things which are not uniquely possessed. So this is kind of the same thing said a different way that if Helen is beautiful the statement is true then it is both true that Helen's beauty uniquely belongs to her and her beauty does not uniquely belong to her. The main argument for this is that without it re-identifying sensibles would become impossible and this is the basis for Plato's rejection of Heraclitianism the philosopher Heraclitus. Re-identifying something at another point in time requires a metaphysical identity. If all you have is flux, if all you have is process without any kind of forms that this flux enters into then your worldview would become completely unintelligible. Now Plato also believes that this is necessary to explain false predicate of judgments. So saying something like Socrates is sitting requires one to understand what it means to say he is standing. False predicate of judgments are only intelligible owing to the intelligibility of true predicate of judgments. So now we get to the idea of the good which as mentioned Gerson sees as absolutely central to the whole Platonist system. The whole system is really built and downstream of the idea of the good and this is something that is left out of many accounts of Platonism. So what ties all the elements of Platonism together is a metaphysical first principle of all the idea of the good. The good is beyond essence or wattness and can only be inferred from its effects. Anything that has been is an effect of the good. All philosophical explanation converges on the good. We know from Aristotle's testimony another fragments that Plato identified the good with the one. The good is the one because it must be beyond any principles of limit and therefore unqualifiably simple. And the forms are good like because they are principles of integrative unity. However the forms are not ultimate explanations because none of them are qualifiably one. The ultimate first principle of the one or the good is what makes Plato's philosophy hierarchical. The greater unity there is the closer something is to the first principle. Identifying the one with the good means unity is also an index of goodness. Now why does Plato even posit the idea of the good? Well we don't find anywhere in the dialogues or in the indirect tradition of Platonism an actual argument for depositing of this superordinate first principle of all that's beyond existence and essence. But Gerson argues that we can discern Plato's reasons for doing this based on the assumptions of his philosophy and these are that first he assumed that there were explanations for things and secondly he was an explanatory reductivist which is a term used earlier which is just to say that he sought first principles that were foundational and simple. The sought for principle must be different to that which it explains and lastly if the first principle of all is the source of everything it must also be the explanation for the end or goal of everything. Quote if the good is the source of essence it is also the fulfillment of essence. This idea is very central to Platonism that the greater generates the lesser and then the greater is both the source and the end of the lesser and so the end of everything is the good or the one and then of course this gets us this way of measuring hierarchy where hierarchy is to move towards unity or integrative unity and the ultimate unity is the one and so the one generates or emanates the world and then the world is kind of directed back towards unity and goodness in this way. So this is central to the Platonic system and this is where we move to virtue and its relation to the idea of the good because as mentioned earlier accounts of Plato's ethics and other aspects of his philosophy when they're divorced from the idea of the good there ends up being all sorts of contradictions and it becomes very arbitrary so we have to re-examine Platonic virtue in light of the centrality of the idea of the good. Aristotle critiques the form of the good in Nicomachean ethics. His main argument is that the good is not univocally predicable like other forms which is just to say that good in the context of when means another thing to good in the context of how there are different forms of goodness. There are a number of places in the dialogues in which Plato seems to group and differently a form of the good along with other forms and yet in the Republic the idea of the good is said to be beyond essence. So Proclus later Platonus his explanation for this is that Plato posits both a form of the good among other forms and also this superordinate idea of the good or the one. Plato argues that the idea of the good is the source of the goodness of every particular good this would mean that there's no conflict between what is good for an individual and what is the good just as it would be incoherent to ask if a mathematical truth which is true for me is also true. If that which appears to be good for oneself is really good it is because it indirectly manifests or instantiates the idea of the good the principle of measure and the source of truth and beauty. So this gives us kind of a better understanding of this idea from Socrates that no one owes willingly that evil is just caused by ignorance and if we knew the good we would all pursue it because in this Platonus scheme the good and the good for the individual are identical. Now this is interesting goodness as integrative unity this is really central to understanding ethics from a Platonus perspective but again something that's not discussed so much when this topic is typically covered. So because the good is the one the good manifests an integrative unity. Now that's a term you won't see much it's one that Gerson uses what it basically means is the imposition of unity by a higher function on a lower without the elimination of the ladder. Something is good insofar as it is an integrative unity and the one is the cause of the being of the integrative unity of everything. Integrative unity is what makes anything at all intelligible to understand anything it is necessary to see the unity of its parts. The ideal integrative unity of the soul consists in cognitive identity with all that is intelligible. The integrative unity of the soul is that of the parts of the soul ordered according to the rule of reason. This is how integrative unity works the higher integrates and transcends the lower. One of the things it means to say that the good is the one is that the good for a person is achievable only via an integrative unity the sort of unity appropriate for a human being. Built on this metaphysical foundation ethical prescriptions can be judged according to whether or not they inhibit or promote integrative unity. Everyone has his or her own way of unifying their lives or constructing an integrative self-narrative. One life can be judged better than another because it's closer to the good itself. The absolutely simple first principle of all. Music, physical training, mathematics, astronomy and dialectic are concrete ways of achieving the good that is producing an ever greater integrative unity in the human being. Now Eros and the good. The connection between the good as principle and the good as end is made explicit by Plotinus in the Enneads. He says and it the good is itself an object of love and love that is love of itself in as much as it is only beautiful by reason of itself and in itself and indeed whatever is present to itself would not be so if that which is present and that to which it is present were not one or identical. So the good is identified with Eros and the good is beautiful because it is Eros. Of course the Greeks use this term Eros to mean certain kind of passionate, desirous love. Plato says that all things strive for the good and Eros for possession of the beautiful is the same thing as for possession of the good. Everything desires that from which it comes. All beings desire the good and so strive for integrative unity. Plotinus says the good is also Eros of itself that is the good is essentially an activity of self-loving but the good as Plato says is overflowing therefore this self-loving is essentially productive. So this is the Plotinus idea of creation as an emanation of the good of the absolute directed as it were back towards itself by the activity of love and what that looks like concretely being directed back towards source back towards our ultimate end or good is unity integrative unity. Now after having looked at the system of Platonism and how it presents an alternative to naturalism, Gerson turns to historical Platonism and looking at how Platonism unfolded through other Platonists that came after Plato himself and of course where else to start but with Aristotle. Gerson does have a separate book called Aristotle and Other Platonists so this is something he's argued a lot is the proper way to understand Aristotle as a Platonist. Plato's work was still ongoing at the time of his death and Platonism as a systematic philosophy was completed by Aristotle, Plotinus and Proclus. Aristotle shares Plato's five anti's that's the five positions Plato opposed earlier on that we talked about Aristotle also poses all of those and he also shares Plato's positing a metaphysical first principle of all. Scholars often point Aristotle's rejection of the immortality of the soul as a reason for excluding him from Platonism. Gerson argues that none of the fundamentals of Platonism actually require a belief about the immortality of the soul. Also Aristotle believes in the immortality of the intellect which may not be different from the immortal part of the soul that Plato identifies. Aristotle believes that super sensible or immaterial being exists necessarily in which case the denial of its existence entails a contradiction. If immaterial entities did not exist physics would not fill the role of metaphysics as naturalists claim rather there could be no such thing as metaphysics or a science of being qua being. There could only be a science which quote cuts off a part of being and studies that but does not examine being universally. So Aristotle clearly has the same conception of philosophy and what philosophy does in terms of studying intelligible being that science can't study and he clearly has the same perspective on the unique knowledge offered by philosophy. When we look at Aristotle's discussion on first philosophy, Aristotle implies that physics is second philosophy while Plato reserves the term philosophy for what Aristotle calls first philosophy, refusing to designate what naturalists do as philosophy at all. Both of them deny the autonomy of physics. Aristotle unlike Plato thinks that there is only knowledge of what is universal and necessary. What Plato calls philosophy, Aristotle calls first philosophy and both identify its subject matter with the intelligible, nonsensible world. Here is a quote from Gerson on the topic. Since the sign of being qua being is the science of the properties of being and these can only be understood when they are understood as derived from the primary referent of being namely the unmoved mover. All metaphysics is saturated with the immaterial. It is the explanation for the necessity and universality of science and the dependence of physics on the primary referent of being that makes it practically impossible to recruit Aristotle to the ranks of naturalists. Aristotle also contributes the idea of potency to the Platonic project holding that it is not possible to understand any process in nature without understanding the potency which is its terminus. But potency is not sensible and can have no role to play in a naturalist account of nature. So we see a lot of reasons why this approach that is sometimes taken of presenting Aristotle as a philosopher that is friendly to naturalism runs into a lot of problems. And this idea of potency was taken up by later Platonists. Plotinus draws on it quite heavily. Now another thing that Aristotle argues for that is very Platonist but he actually argues for this more explicitly than Plato is the immateriality of the intellect. So Aristotle more than Plato makes arguments for why the intellect must be immaterial. Since we can think of form universally, if intellect was not immaterial then our thinking of form would just be another particularized version of it. Aristotle argues that thinking universally for example of mathematics defies naturalist reduction. Particularized forms are sufficient to serve as guides for survival for plants and animals. So you know the argument is if the naturalist perspective was true why can we think of something like abstract truths of mathematics. This argument is certainly still relevant today when we have accepted Darwinian evolution as the means by which our minds evolved because again the same kind of argument could be made that if that is the case why would our minds, why would our brains be attuned to anything but survival value? Why would we be able to cognize truth or cognize form universally? The universality of thinking requires self-reflexivity. If this were not the case then thinking would just be one part of the brain monitoring another but this would only be a new brain state and universality would not be achieved. Presence of form and the awareness of the presence must be in the same subject and this can only happen if the subject is immaterial and capable of bending back upon itself. Something that material entities with parts cannot do. This is basically an argument that you know the mind must be something other than the brain. When we think, when we cognize, it's not just individual parts of the brain experiencing other parts of the brain but there is a self-reflexivity there in the words of Gersen. Now of course another concept that Aristotle is very closely associated with is his idea of the on-move mover which was quite influential on the development of theism and theistic philosophy. Aristotle agrees with Plato on the subject matter of first philosophy as mentioned which is the intelligible world and that a plurality of principles should be reduced to a unity. Aristotle has the same kind of explanatory reductivism as Plato but their disagreement comes in identifying the nature of the first principle. Aristotle explicitly rejects as the first principle the superordinate idea of the good along with the rest of the forms, the demiurge, and also to claim that the one and the unlimited are the principles out of which the forms are made. However the on-move mover can arguably be held to fulfill the functions of the above. Aristotle agrees with Plato that the first principle is both the source and goal of creation. From the perspective of later plateness the problem with Aristotle's version of that system sprang from his identification of the first principle of all with intellect but they saw Aristotle as someone whose insights could be mine to support a systematic platonic framework. So Aristotle does posit the on-move mover as an eternal intellect and this is certainly different from Plato's conception of the superordinate idea of the good, the one, and later plateness are obviously much closer to Plato on this but we can see that he posits this eternal on-move mover, this eternal intellect to really solve the same kinds of problems that Plato was trying to solve. It's the same kind of explanatory system. So you can see what Rorty meant earlier when he said that even people that disagreed with Plato did so on kind of plateness grounds. Now of course we have to look at Plotinus who probably more than anyone put together a Platonism as a complete coherent system. Plotinus regarded himself and his philosophy as introducing no novelty into Platonism. Instead of discarding Aristotle he integrates many of his insights into a platonic system. The three basic principles of Plotinus philosophy are the triad of one the intellect and the soul which he claims are present in Plato's dialogues. Gerson sees Plotinus drawing out the implications of a necessary first being as his greatest contribution to the Platonic project. Plotinus claims that the first principle must be above being and not as Aristotle claims identical with it. Plotinus argues that being is not unqualifiably one but is a one many. Being cannot be absolutely simple because being means being an existent of some sort. Instead the oneness of being is just the unity of multiplicity. This only makes sense because there is a first principle which transcends being and is unqualifiably one. One thing that Gerson focuses on is Plotinus argument against the Stoics because he thinks this is very relevant to his broader discussion of Platonism and naturalism and his belief that they are incompatible. So Plotinus criticism of the Stoics presents an interest and insight into the opposition between Platonism and naturalism because the Stoics are one of the best examples of trying to deny their incompatibility. Stoics were naturalists that had some elements of Platonism. They believed in materialism, mechanism and nominalism but like the Platonists rejected skepticism and relativism. Plotinus agrees with the Stoics that the rational life is the best life but Stoics cannot explain why rationally participating in the cosmos is superior to participating in the way non-rational creatures do. Plotinus believes a satisfactory answer requires the idea of the good to great achievements. If Stoics accepted this and added relativism to their worldview then reason would just be an instrumental servant of the passions. Stoics can't maintain both materialism and universal normativity. So really although Plotinus is sympathetic to the Stoics because they have this kind of platonic insight of privileging reason and the life of reason and a more kind of ascetic approach to things it's really hard to base this in a materialist worldview. Again why you know if nature is what's to be worshipped, celebrated and if you have this mechanistic materialist worldview why would reason be superior to any other form of life? So although the Stoic approach to things is coming from positive intuition and many of the prescriptions they would make on the ethical life are very similar to Platonism they can't ultimately ground this without some absolute, without something that is superordinate in order to grade ways of living and to explain why reason and the rational life is superior to irrational life. Why would the sage be in any way superior in the way he lives to non-human life that behaves irrationally? So the Stoics don't really have a good explanation here. Now another very influential later Platonist is Proclus. Proclus is probably best known as most important contribution to Platonism is he kind of comes up with a full theology of Platonism that he feels could be married to Greek polytheism. Now Proclus is dealing with the problem left by Plotinus which is how does this absolutely beyond being version of the one and how does this generate multiplicity? How does this generate the world without really being directly related to it without being itself determined in any way? The central problem left by Plotinus was how multiplicity could proceed from the one while it remains without multiplicity. The answer of Proclus is to posit intermediary henads or unities and these really are the gods. So Proclus argues that these energies, these henads are greater unities than the forms and so they can explain how the one can generate multiplicity much better than the system of Plotinus. As participated unities the henads bridge the gap between the one and multiplicity. They're more unified than each form but less unified than the one and as mentioned this allows Proclus to unify Platonist metaphysics and the traditional gods of Greek religion. Now it's still not really clear if this solves the problem Proclus was dealing with. There's still the issue of how the one generates multiplicity even if there are these greater unities in between. It seems you could get some kind of infinite regress where there'd be more unified things all the way up. There'd be something more unified than the henads between the henads and the one and dealing with these really fundamental questions about the one and its relation to existence is what came to occupy later Platonists and specifically Damascus who was the last head of Plato's Academy. He raises problems with the very intelligibility of the idea of the one. The first principle of all must be absolutely simple but if it is absolutely simple it is impossible for it to be causally connected to anything. Damascus makes these arguments in his work Problems and Solutions Concerning First Principles where he really draws out all of the implications and kind of dialectical contradictions that happen whenever we try and intellectually conceive of the absolute and its relation to ourselves. Another argument he makes is that if the first principle of all is disconnected from all things then the universe would not be the totality of all things but if the first principle is part of the totality of things it is not a first principle. But also we can't say that the totality of things is its own explanation because unless there is a distinction between what is explicable and what is not then there's no such thing as an explanation at all. Here Gerson says we're left with a profound apuria. There must be an ultimate explanation for everything but such an explanation can neither be disconnected from everything nor a part of everything and Damascus takes away even the possibility of negative predications to the one. All discourse or intellectual grasping concerning the one is subject to dialectical contradiction. Damascus thus emphasizes the importance of not attempting to grasp the ineffable by means of any language so although Damascus does certainly believe in the necessity of positing the one of positeness absolute first principle of ultimate reality he really resembles a lot of buddhist and later mystical thinkers in emphasizing that reason thought and language is just really limited in what we can say negatively or positively about the nature of this and so he actually advises a kind of learned ignorance again a kind of mystical sentiment that he advises his followers not to try too hard to intellectually grasp this but to kind of live in the mystery and to understand a true intuition and through a kind of live knowing that he believes is accessible to everyone. Again Platonism is bound up with a kind of mysticism and with an experiential aspect to its philosophy and this seems to be really emphasized in Damascus but as demonstrated by Damascus, Platonist successors came to appreciate perhaps a resolvable tension between the absolute simplicity of the one and its explanatory adequacy for the many and Gerson concludes that quote the alternative to naturalism of any sort and along with that the possibility of philosophy depends on the resolution of this tension. So Gerson rejects naturalism he presents Platonism as really the only alternative to rejecting the tenets of naturalism and at the close of the book he does say that these difficulties presented by Damascus and this sort of fundamental difficulty in Platonism is the one potential crack in the system or it's the one thing that needs to be resolved that needs to be dealt with is how this absolutely simple first principle relates to creation relates to the multiplicity and Gerson kind of leaves that as an open question at the end of this book but that is Platonism and naturalism by Gerson. I hope this was helpful as an introduction to Platonism as mentioned a lot of the introductions and discussions around Platonism don't really deal with this deeper sort of Platonic framework that emerged and that was common to Platonists it doesn't deal with things like the centrality of the idea of the good the one to Platonism and so I thought this book and a presentation on it is a good way to put the whole of Platonism as a system into perspective and also to present this conflict that I do believe exists between Platonism and naturalism and it's an interesting angle it's an interesting way to read for the history of Western philosophy as basically a conflict between Platonism and naturalism and then you can read philosophers since the Enlightenment you can read them as trying to synthesize it in some way so for example you just take the example of the five anti's that were outlined so someone like Schopenhauer would reject materialism he rejects skepticism as well but he does maintain mechanism or determinism so you can see you can read various philosophers in this way and see their systems as attempt to marry Platonism and naturalism by bringing together some of these anti's a rejection of them with an affirmation of others and I think this is actually quite insightful I think this is quite an interesting way of viewing philosophy because as Rorty says without this sort of fundamental union between thought and being and the potential of our intellect to commune with being and with the intelligible world in a very fundamental way that we can trust then the whole possibility of philosophy becomes difficult to maintain and it seems like one would have to commit themselves to skepticism and to a naturalist materialist view of the world so going back to these arguments and looking at how they unfolded and really boiling it down to the fundamental conflicts that exist here I think is is quite helpful but that's all for now I hope you enjoyed this if you did
