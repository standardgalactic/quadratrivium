0	29880	All right, I'm live, I'm here with Ervol, and we're going to be discussing
29880	37400	Platonism. How are you doing, Ervol? Not too bad, yourself? Yeah, not too bad. I
37400	41640	finally, we were meant to do this last week, actually. I didn't give people a
41640	46120	reason why we cancelled, but I ended up getting that illness everyone has been
46120	50440	talking about. And, you know, I heard the latest strain was meant to be quite
50440	56840	mild, but it's definitely was one of the one of the worst viruses I've had. But
56840	62360	yeah, doing pretty good. But yeah, as far as Platonism, I mean, some people
62360	68280	know you as like the Plato guy, you know, you're, but you're doing a reading group
68280	72280	on it now, which you could chill for later if people are interested in that. But
72280	76600	yeah, I mean, I guess the first question is why do you think going back to
76600	84560	Plato is of relevance or of such importance? Right. Well, in a lot of ways,
84720	89600	Plato was in a similar situation to the one that we're in. The traditions of his
89600	93760	time had been breaking down. You know, if you look at the behavior of the
93760	99600	Sophists, it resembles that of postmodern academics today, deconstructing things,
99600	105040	saying the truth is relative, having no reverence for the gods or eternal
105040	109040	realities and things of that nature, reducing everything to kind of flux
109120	114320	and accidents of the one kind of true material substrate materialistic monism.
115680	124640	And Plato found a way of harmonizing the gods, his tradition, his the ways of his
124640	131120	people with this rationalistic current. And the historical influence obviously
131120	136000	alone justifies going back to Plato. I don't think you can really seriously
136000	141920	claim to be a philosopher or to seriously study philosophy unless you go through
141920	147600	the works of Plato, not just because there are so many fundamental ideas introduced
147600	152640	into the history of Western philosophy through Plato, but because the rest of
152640	157680	the philosophical tradition is responding to Plato in one way or another, often
157680	164640	uncharitably, you know, unfairly Nietzsche's critiques of Plato I see is so much
164640	171840	question begging. I know Heidegger has some critiques and often people in these spheres
171840	175920	will have read some of these critiques or have heard about some of these critiques of
175920	180320	Platonism. And then without actually studying Platonism, they write it off because
180880	185680	the people that they respect write it off. I think it's a similar phenomenon to the people
185680	190640	who get into like alternative physics you'll often find or at least I often find these people
190720	197040	on YouTube who have this, you know, new model of physics like vortex physics or physics derived
197040	203680	from like the 10 basic numbers, kind of like Pythagoreanism. But the reason people go for
203680	208960	those things is that the people putting forward these radical alternatives at the same time are
208960	213440	saying the entire history of mathematics and physics up until this time has been wrong.
214000	218000	And then you watching the video say, oh, well, that's convenient because I don't know any of that
218000	223680	anyway. So now I can just listen to this guy and get it all from him. So I think this kind of anti
223680	232000	Platonism offers an out from doing the real work of learning the Western philosophical tradition
232000	237360	from the ground up. You can't understand any of antique philosophy without understanding Platonism.
237360	241840	You can't understand scholasticism. You can't understand the thinking of the Renaissance.
241840	247120	You really just can't understand anything in the history of Western philosophy without Plato.
247120	252240	And like I said, the main reason, though, is that we're in a similar position where if we don't
252240	259920	harmonize the scientific knowledge that we have today with metaphysics, with our traditional
259920	267760	theological conceptions, many of which basically all of which derived from Platonism, we're not
267760	273360	going to have something to unify us going forward. It takes more than just kind of
274000	284000	emotive, you know, something a, you know, ineffable quality that people have in a particular sphere
284000	290240	that galvanizes them. Like that's not what actually builds long lasting historical movements.
290240	298480	There has to be a kind of crystalline ideological core that keeps an organization going keeps a
298480	306160	group going and motivates them. Pythagoreanism did that. Platonism did that through institutions on
306160	312400	the one hand schools and a core philosophy that people shared in common that explicit
312400	317440	philosophical consensus is the only way to get ethical consensus. So, you know, political
317440	323840	practicalities, learning the history of Western philosophy, and then also, which I didn't mention
323840	331440	yet, I do think that Platonism has the metaphysical toolkit to address the metaphysical deficiencies
331440	337040	of modern physics, right? We have excellent understanding of dynamics in modern physics,
337040	343040	but we don't know very much at all about the substrate. What are these things that are behaving
343040	347840	in the ways that the wave function behaves? You know, what is the stuff that the universe is made
347840	356160	of? And what categories can we draw metaphysically to make sense of all of that? So, Platonism is just
356160	361520	one of the most well developed metaphysical frameworks in history. And I think anyone who's
361520	366240	trying a theory of everything these days, like I saw you had Chris Langan on, you know, he's
366240	371120	a key example. I mean, a lot of his ideas are similar to Platonism. I think he would recognize
371120	378960	that. So, yeah, I mean, I think to understand the past, to put us together, gather us together
378960	386160	today in a harmony, and then moving forward for better scientific groundwork for a worldview.
387120	393040	Yeah, well, there is that quote by Alfred North Whitehead that the safest generalization of
393040	399680	Western philosophy is the series of footnotes to Plato. And I saw an exaggeration like Richard
399680	409360	Rorty, who's the famous American pragmatist, or like a, you know, a complete relativist,
409360	416160	moral relativist, he rejects philosophy. And I forget which one of his books it was,
416160	423200	but he wrote in the introduction that his task was basically to get rid of Platonism.
424160	430560	And he also, he made some, might seem like a radical claim, but he said that all philosophy
430560	436960	since Plato was Platonism, because his claim was that even the people that have rejected Plato have
436960	444880	done so with kind of Platonist starting point, and even just the idea that, you know, thought and
444880	451680	reality, cohere in the way Plato imagined. But yeah, I mean, I do think it's a problem,
451680	457040	especially in like sort of, you know, the St. Raider where you want to call it circles, that
457040	464400	people, people obviously come at philosophy, you know, at other motivations, they're not necessarily
464400	472000	trying to get a great grasp of the whole Western canon. I guess they generally have a more instrumental
472000	477520	view of things. And so I find you get too much, you get a focus on, you know, thinkers like
477520	484480	Evella, Spengler, Nietzsche, obviously. But people want to kind of, you know, they want like
484480	489360	to kind of a simple metric to kind of read all of Western thought through some kind of based
489360	497680	metrics like Nietzscheanism, or even like kind of a very simplified, like a Heideggerian critique
497680	505920	of techniques and of philosophy. And yeah, that definitely leads to oversight. I think there is
505920	513200	a kind of like, you know, meme Nietzscheanism that permeates the right a lot, especially as it
513200	520880	comes to Plato. So I mean, the basic kind of Nietzschean critique of Plato, you see something
520880	529520	like Spencer said this a lot that Plato was like the, it was the start of this nihilism that came
529520	537280	to fruition with Christianity, where we started to kind of lessen the value of the physical world,
537280	543120	and imagine this perfect world of forms. And that as soon as that, as soon as we started that endeavor,
543120	551520	as soon as we started to try and find some perfect world of pure thought, or, you know,
551520	556320	so there's some other world that we started on the path to nihilism, and it was kind of inevitably
556320	563520	going to lead to all of the kind of life denying philosophies we have now and some of the, even
563520	567680	like the sort of extreme liberalism, some people argue that like in the, you know, the kind of
567680	577600	transhumanist ethic. So I'm curious, like, what do you think of that kind of basic kind of quasi
577600	584560	Nietzschean criticism of Platonism? Yeah, like, so again, I don't know exactly how true that is to
584560	589360	Nietzsche himself, but it is characteristically Nietzschean in the sense that it's not really an
589360	593760	argument, strictly speaking. It's saying, you know, I don't like the conclusion that you came to.
594320	599440	I'm sentimentally averse, like saying that it leads to nihilism is a kind of moral consequentialism
599440	609920	from a moral nihilist, which doesn't even make sense. But yeah, I think the the issue that
610880	616480	Nietzsche has with Platonism is not unique to Platonism. You go all the way back to, like,
616480	623680	Siberian shamanism, presumably from the Paleolithic period, and they had this idea that the world
623680	629280	was divided up into different realms, you know, like you see in Norse mythology on Yigitrasil.
629280	636320	There are various realms that you can travel between. And there's good reason why people had these
636400	645760	beliefs. There has been a history of spiritual practice that led a lot of people around the
645760	651440	world to common ideas about what sorts of realms are accessible, what sorts of forces
652080	658800	are there to tap into in that realm. If they were all completely wrong, if there is no,
658880	667840	you know, supernatural realm whatsoever, then why did these beliefs all persist? And it's just,
667840	673840	you know, question begging saying there isn't any such thing. But you can't just presume that you
673840	680400	can't just presuppose the world simply is time, space, causality, and what we see around us. And
680400	686240	that's it. If you buy an evolutionary explanation of perception, which I assume most people who
686240	694480	would buy that pseudo Nietzschean critique would, you wouldn't expect evolution to select for the
694480	702080	perceptual apparatus that would perceive the genuine like ontological substrate of reality.
702080	710000	You would expect evolution to select for perception of fitness payoffs above all. So we'll be
710000	718080	myopically focused on certain facets of reality, like this narrow spectrum of the electromagnetic
719600	725920	spectrum that's narrow bandwidth, visible light. But we don't actually, you know,
725920	731280	know reality just because we see things. This is the way that we navigate is like a user interface
731280	737680	that has developed to help us survive as biological creatures. There's no reason to think that
737680	744480	the categories, the basic intuitive naive categories like matter naively conceived just
744480	750560	is what reality is at base. According to evolutionary theory, wouldn't expect that an
750560	755440	evolutionary game theory, Donald Hoffman came up with the, the fitness beats truth theorem.
756160	762880	And he modeled various evolutionary scenarios and demonstrated that, you know, evolution does not
762880	769840	select for perception of the true nature of whatever system this evolution is taking place in.
769840	778640	It selects for like myopic perception of fitness payoffs. And the key insight of Platonism and
778640	785040	Pythagoras before him was saying that actually, you know, the way that the world seems at face
785920	794240	masks, a deeper harmony that operates according to, you know, different logic than the logic of
794240	799520	everyday reality, you know, bumping into stuff, things colliding like base naive materialism.
799520	804560	Actually, when you investigate the things of the material world and kind of draw down to their
804560	811840	syntactic core, the underlying logic behind mundane phenomena, we find these mathematical
811840	820640	structures. And that line, that Platonizing line of putting an ontological status on
820640	826960	universals and mathematical objects led to taking those things seriously, building out a
826960	836880	mathematical model of the world. And that actually led to scientific progress. Right. So the idea
836880	843760	of another world is not prima facia ridiculous. It would kind of be strange if the universe in
843760	849600	its entirety was simply what we see around us, like the observable universe just is reality.
850480	855520	We don't have an explanation if we just go with this kind of naive perception of the world as
855520	860640	it seems, we don't have an explanation for where the laws of physics reside. We don't have an
860640	866320	explanation for what universal properties are what ontological status they have. Right. It's
866320	873760	just a very incomplete model of the world that like, and we know that that kind of perception of
873760	879760	the world as being fundamentally flux, you know, inevitably tied to matter, didn't actually build
880480	886720	the math science technology that the modern world is based on. It was the the Platonizers
886720	892160	through our history. You mentioned Alfred North Whitehead, you know, he worked with
892240	898000	Bertrand Russell, who also studied Plato. He criticized Plato in his history of Western
898000	903600	philosophy book. But a lot of his mature developments are obviously inspired by Platonism,
903600	909840	including this kind of intermediate status of mathematical objects. And so they tried to work
909840	915280	up something that was actually in the spirit of Leibniz, a kind of characteristic universalist
915760	922480	universal logical language with their Principia Mathematica, which was largely successful.
923200	929120	Their kind of systematizing of logic mathematics led to developments in computer.
930080	936320	So it was practically useful. But Russell, who was inspired by Platonism, wouldn't have had
936320	941600	this idea unless he was a scholar of Leibniz, which he was, and Leibniz was a Platonist. And
941600	947440	his ideas fit very neatly into Neoplatonism, up to including the idea of the monad, this kind of
947440	951920	fractal embodiment that the monad possesses, we can maybe get into a little bit, a little bit of
951920	959120	that later. You know, Frege, who started analytical philosophy, was a Platonist. And then Goethel,
959120	966400	who disproved the basic intention of Principia Mathematica, which was inspired by this computationalist
966400	971200	theory of mathematics, where if we just have the right set of axioms and algorithms, we can have
971200	978000	full systematic proof of all propositions. Goethel said, no, you can't. And, you know, that was because
978000	984560	Goethel grasped an aspect of our cognitive faculties that the Platonist grasped that
985360	991280	Russell wanted to leave out, which was intellect, properly speaking, or the mathematical intuition,
991280	996880	which is not exclusively mathematical. But anyway, it's just you see the influence of
997840	1004160	Platonism through and through with the history of modern philosophy, ancient philosophy. And to say
1004160	1009280	you don't like the idea of some other realm or that there's something beyond the world that we see,
1009280	1015760	like, where does that come from? I get the kind of instinct to say, like, you know, the way I've
1015760	1021200	always thought about the world since I was three, the basic way I perceive things, that's just what
1021200	1027120	it is. And we don't have to go beyond that. And all this math, well, we like abstract the math from
1027120	1032640	the world. And while that may be in a certain regard epistemologically true, not wholly true,
1032640	1041600	because we also have these intuitions that are not via induction. Yeah, we, nevertheless, you
1041600	1046480	can't make sense of that kind of account of mathematical objects of universals without, at the
1046480	1052160	same time, relying on their ultimate validity, like to express the position of nominalism,
1052160	1058160	you're going to have to use Platonic realism or a belief in the reality of universals. I might be
1058160	1063200	using a bit too much philosophical jargon for people who are not already into Platonism. But
1064080	1071440	well, I mean, it's a very, it's a very nihilistic position in a way to take this kind of
1071840	1077840	sort of meme, natuionism approach to everything where you're kind of judging,
1078880	1083440	you're judging theories based on like how life affirming there, like you're treating philosophy
1083440	1092000	as this sort of therapeutic existentialist cure to the human condition. And you know,
1092000	1096080	you're already presupposing that there's there's no objective truth to be found or you're already
1096080	1100800	presupposing like this metaphysical anti realism. But someone in someone in the chat said,
1101920	1105360	you know, we're going to be discussing Platonism. So he said, you know, and get ready to hear loads
1105360	1111120	of things that aren't epistemically justified. So I guess that that would be another attitude.
1112160	1117200	You definitely find it a lot in people that study philosophy now that they kind of assume
1117200	1121840	that well, you know, you have classical philosophy here. But you know, something happened along the
1121840	1128880	way. And these people didn't really interrogate their kind of epistemological starting point,
1128880	1132960	you know, they didn't they didn't really interrogate like what the mind can can really
1132960	1137680	know about the world. And you know, we've had Hume and Kant and these people sense and, you know,
1137680	1144080	the kind of Copernican turn turn in philosophy. And so this kind of naive kind of approach to
1144080	1150880	metaphysics is is very outdated. And you're kind of better starting with with more sort of
1151920	1159600	analytical stuff. So like, what would you say the the starting point is for you as a Platonist?
1159600	1164640	Like, you know, do you assume a kind of naive, you know, are you just sort of start with the
1164640	1171280	assumption that there's this coherence between the mind and ultimate reality? Or do you think
1171280	1176480	that there's like a series of sort of smaller scale justifications along the way that have to
1176480	1183360	bring you there? Like, do you start with epistemology? Yeah, well, I'm not a foundationalist
1184480	1188160	in my own philosophy. So there's no one starting point, you know, I like
1189280	1198080	Quine Willard Quine's Holism, where, you know, inevitably, one proposition, one theory will
1198080	1204800	implicate other theories in your kind of toolkit. And so ultimately, a whole worldview has to develop
1204880	1211680	organically. And in terms of internal consistency, and then in terms of explanatory power, in terms of
1211680	1216880	predictive power, all of these metrics, and then you evaluate whole frameworks on that basis,
1216880	1224080	rather than the foundationalist attempt at epistemological grounding, where like empiricism,
1224080	1229840	all knowledge is built up from sense data. And that's, you know, this kind of model of how we
1229840	1236160	come to have knowledge was really, you know, devastated by Willard Quine in, I think, the 50s.
1237440	1244480	So in analytical philosophy today, that's not a popular epistemological position. Actually,
1244480	1252160	that innovation, this kind of Holism and pragmatism, Quine was a pragmatist, was already there in
1252880	1262240	the old academy, under carnities, I think, when the Platonists took a turn towards skepticism,
1262240	1268560	academic skepticism, was very different from the other ancient, the other popular ancient
1268560	1274240	skeptical school of Pyranism, which basically held that all knowledge is simply impossible. And it
1274240	1279680	was mostly about just kind of reaching a this catharsis and, you know, comfortable state of
1279680	1284720	mind, resting in a poria, resting in uncertainty, you know, what, what are you going to do? You
1284720	1291120	can't really figure out anything anyway. Whereas academic skepticism was about like, let's put
1291120	1297760	forward hypotheses and build up this theory while admitting our own fallibility all the while.
1298800	1307280	Now, within Platonism, there are theories about the basis of higher level knowledge. I think the
1307280	1313520	most famous example is the divided line from the Republic. So if you remember in book seven of the
1313520	1319760	Republic, when he discusses the cave, he illustrates the example of the cave afterwards with this
1319760	1326720	concept of the divided line. So you take a line, which symbolizes the unity of mind as a whole,
1326720	1333120	divide it in two, but unequally. So one part is larger, one part is smaller, the largeness of
1333120	1342000	this segment of the line represents the security and, you know, firmness of our grasping of
1342000	1348080	intelligible. So the larger segment is intelligible reality. And then the smaller segment is sensible
1348080	1355200	reality. And we have faculties associated with each of these targets of knowledge. So we have
1355200	1361680	two discrete faculties that deal with intelligibles and two discrete faculties which deal with
1361680	1368960	sensibles. And so you divide the shorter segment according to the same ratio, which is the ratio
1368960	1377120	of bi, and the smallest of all segments will have to do with our recognition of images as such.
1377120	1382000	You know, Schopenhauer had a similar distinction between, you know, pure sensation and perception.
1382880	1388640	So for, this is already there in Neoplatonism by the time of Iamblichus and arguably, I mean,
1388640	1394080	by the time of Plato himself, Iamblichus actually ascribes the concept of the divided line and these,
1394960	1401520	this theory of cognitive faculties to Architas of Tarentum, who is an elder contemporary of Plato,
1401520	1409120	early member of the Academy, you know, genuine, you know, old Pythagorean contributed to development
1409120	1418000	mathematics and all of that. But yeah, this, so at the bottom, we have this faculty of basically
1418000	1423360	sensation or imagination, which has to do with recognizing similarity and dissimilarity. That's
1423360	1429920	the distinguishing feature of that cognitive faculty, which is Icazia in Greek. And then we have
1430480	1436400	doxar belief, which is what Schopenhauer would call perception, where instead of just treating the raw
1436400	1442800	kind of phenomenological appearance of form and distinguishing forms in that lower sense,
1442800	1450000	like the shape of things in their similarity, we have the, you know, hypothesis of some underlying
1450000	1457680	reality, which we only know by inference, just as Schopenhauer says, we don't know the objects of
1457680	1464560	material reality directly. We infer from the presence of sense data, you know, Locke basically
1464560	1470000	agrees with this, this model of things as well, and they got it from the ancients, you know,
1470000	1476000	this stuff was already there in Plato. And then on the intelligible side, the smaller faculty
1476640	1483440	is Dianoya, which is discursive reasoning, which is step by step procedures, you know,
1483440	1489600	similar to the computationalist project of Russell and Whitehead. And then above
1489920	1497920	that kind of reason, there is intellect or noose, which is an intuitive faculty, and you have to
1497920	1505280	have this idea to make mathematics work. There has to be something in our mind that allows us to find
1505840	1513600	correct axioms for mathematics, right? You can't prove the validity of an axiom in math through
1513600	1518160	any mathematical formal system. So there has to be something beyond Dianoya that we're using there.
1519120	1527600	So this basic, you know, schema of the psyche, I think holds pretty true, you know, and it's
1527600	1533120	interesting that Dianoya has a kind of dual role. So there's a strict sense of Dianoya where we see
1533120	1540080	its peculiar energies, activities, most starkly, which is in mathematical and logical reasoning,
1540080	1547280	but also the literal translation is through thinking. And it is what basically moves us
1547280	1557120	from Icazia to Daxa to Dianoya, strictly speaking, to the intellect. And yeah, so there's something
1557680	1565520	mathematical or logical or like Turing machine like about human cognition, broadly speaking. And
1567120	1572320	yeah, that's it's a very interesting notion that ties in with the idea of the soul, the composition
1572320	1577440	of the soul, the essence of the soul that you see in the Timaeus, when the Demiurge constructs
1577440	1583520	the world soul, he constructs that soul out of ratios. He takes the powers of two and the powers
1583520	1591520	of three, and through a set of kind of algorithmic procedures, builds all of the ratios that we get
1592240	1599520	in music of the perfect fifth, perfect fourth, octave, and so forth. And, you know, this is
1599520	1606720	the composition of the essence of the soul in some way. So math is on the same level as soul.
1606720	1611120	Some people might have heard in Platonism that mathematical objects are an intermediary level
1611120	1618560	between the forms, which are unitive, unextended, and then material reality, which is divisible
1618560	1626880	about body. So math is an intermediary. So is soul. So soul and math are very intimately related. And,
1626880	1632640	you know, if we're going to follow the prescription of the Delphic Oracle to know
1632640	1638720	thyself, we also have to know math, which kind of ties into this idea, like people criticize
1638720	1645840	Plato for turning his back on tradition. Well, I mean, he references one commandment from the
1645840	1651520	Oracle to double the size of a particular altar, and they realized that they couldn't do it
1651520	1657440	mathematically, because they didn't know how to calculate double the volume of this shape.
1658640	1664320	So it revealed a kind of defect of mathematical reasoning. So in that instance, Plato refers
1664320	1668560	to what are the gods telling us? They're telling us we don't know enough math yet.
1669920	1673760	And, yeah, I kind of ramble a little bit at the end there. But
1674000	1682480	I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was muted. Yeah, that's another kind of interesting
1682480	1689280	disagreement is the time when Plato came along. So again, this is where you get there's kind of
1689280	1694240	a Nietzschean version of this versus kind of a more traditionalist version of this. So
1695520	1699760	the kind of Nietzschean version of it is that, you know, Socrates should have been put to debt
1699760	1707280	because he was questioning the gods. He was undermining the social order of where he lived.
1707920	1713680	And, you know, he was trying to apply universal reason in this way that was kind of undermining
1713680	1720720	the particularist paganism of his society. And again, that this is like a very nihilistic enterprise.
1720720	1727600	Now, if you read Julius Evela actually criticizes this few a lot, he says that this is like a
1727600	1733520	really bad reading of things that actually what Plato was doing was in a current where
1734320	1740320	Sophism and Humanism had become kind of dominant intellectually, he says it's actually very
1740320	1743280	similar to our own time that what Plato was actually doing was kind of,
1744640	1750320	you know, he's kind of revivifying like a traditionalist cosmology. So again, it's kind
1750320	1755200	of interesting. It's two very different readings. You know, Plato is this sort of
1755200	1761840	libtard revolutionary that's like subversive Socrates subversive versus actually, you know,
1761840	1768640	Plato is seeing like the nihilistic elements thought of his time and he's trying to have
1768640	1775040	things on this more solid foundation and I kind of ground a proper view of things again.
1775040	1779520	So, yeah, can you speak to that a little bit like the, you know, the time frame where Plato
1779520	1784000	was operating like kind of the popular current of thought that he's responding to and what you
1784000	1789200	think of that idea of it being kind of subversive to the society at the time?
1791120	1798000	Right, yeah. Well, the reason why Socrates probably was actually put to death was his
1798000	1804080	connection with members of the 30 tyrants, the puppet regime that Sparta installed after the
1804080	1810160	end of the Peloponnesian War. There's a lot of quotes throughout the dialogues where Socrates
1810160	1814320	seems to reverence the Spartans, you know, mentioned that they are actually really good
1814320	1820800	philosophers and that's why they have these laconic sayings. They're so pithy. So it was
1820800	1828560	probably a matter of questioning Socrates' loyalty and, you know, the charge of impiety
1828560	1835040	and was he questioning the gods? I mean, if you look at, you know, again, in the Republic,
1835040	1841440	Thrasomachus or in the Gorgias, Calakles, the way these characters, the kind of protonegians of
1841440	1848560	their day, were talking about the gods was far more sacrilegious than anything Socrates ever
1848560	1855680	indicated. And I think Plato had a sincere piety. I mean, Neoplatonists all the way down to late
1855680	1863040	antiquity were, you know, practicing their rights. They were worshiping the gods. So this charge of
1863600	1870960	sacrilege or impiety or denying the existence of the gods was probably just an excuse to get
1870960	1878240	rid of someone who the, you know, Democrats in power in Athens, viewed to be a threat to the
1878240	1884160	state because of their questionable loyalty. And then the large influence they had on
1885920	1891520	prominent young noble citizens, you know, Socrates would go around the city finding,
1891520	1899760	you know, the Alcibiades is the competent, talented young men, not to indulge whatever
1899760	1906960	pederastic impulse he may have had, which he never endorses explicitly. Plato never endorses that
1906960	1914720	it is acknowledged as a common sentiment, you know, among many different Greek city states.
1914720	1919440	But Plato rejects that anyway. But it wasn't for that reason that Socrates associated with
1919440	1925440	young men, it was to influence the future thinking of the political class of Athens.
1927040	1934320	So yeah, I mean, I see Plato basically is trying to save respect for the gods,
1935040	1942320	respect for this higher realm from the deconstruction of people like Gorgias or
1942320	1948800	Protagoras. I mean, the Sophists are really one of the chief currents that he's responding to,
1948800	1956560	but also the rationalistic philosophy of the Ionian school, you know, the best example
1956560	1964560	that directly influenced Plato was Anaxagoras, who taught Pericles, the great Athenian statesman,
1965120	1972480	and also Socrates studied the works of Anaxagoras. And what Plato liked about Anaxagoras was the
1972480	1977120	put this principle of mind first, which none of the other Ionian preseocratics did. They
1977120	1981840	kept things very kind of physical in their conception, although I do think that's an oversimplification.
1982480	1990320	But with the actual writings of Anaxagoras, according to Socrates in the, which dialogue was
1990320	1998240	this, might even be Thedo, not sure. But anyway, he says that Anaxagoras, the writings had to do
1998240	2005200	with like physical laws. He was more like a physicist than a philosopher, strictly speaking.
2005200	2010880	And it was this rationalism combined with the deconstructing Sophists and
2010880	2016560	rhetoricians of his day that Plato had to respond to. And they were sacrilegious. I mean,
2017760	2022400	the Orphism was just a kind of history of the
2025360	2033120	tendencies in that day. Orphism spread from around 600 BC in the wake of basically a dying
2033120	2040400	off of respect for the older, you know, perhaps Mycenaean way of worshiping the gods. So they
2040400	2047200	already broke down their their previous religious rituals. And Orphism came in the wake of that
2047200	2054000	with this kind of more mystical, more experiential brand of religion. And of course, the mystery
2054000	2061040	schools were still popular. But there was a kind of irrationalism introduced. And, you know, an
2061040	2068880	emphasis on individual experience. And basically, Plato had to fit that brand of spirituality
2068880	2074240	together with this rationalistic philosophy. And then the Pythagorean influence coming from
2075360	2082000	the Eliadex, the Italian school. And yeah, I mean, he just kind of found the best harmony to bring
2082000	2086480	it all together. I think we might actually be overestimating how much is original to Plato,
2086480	2091680	because we don't know very much about his Pythagorean associates, we have a couple fragments of
2091680	2099200	Arcatas, of, you know, Philo Laos, or some of the other people, or Aristocenus or something in his
2099200	2105920	school. But Plato was originally interested in writing plays, he wrote poems. And then when
2105920	2112000	he met Socrates, he decided, this isn't the way to go, I have to do something in the vein of this
2112800	2119360	emerging trend of philosophy, which he correctly foresaw, would have this massive influence on
2119360	2125280	society. And so he shifted his artistic endeavors, but he kind of remains like,
2126240	2132640	really tied to the format of the dialogue, to constructing these organic holes, you know,
2133360	2140720	his concepts and aesthetics, many of which were probably original, can be seen today still in
2140720	2146080	concepts like what makes an integrated work of art. But that's, I think, where Plato's heart was,
2146080	2152880	and he fit all of these tendencies of thought into one harmonious whole. So he was really a
2152880	2160640	synthesizer of the ideas at his time. And, you know, he did it successfully, he built the institution
2160640	2166640	that needed to be built, and his way of thinking largely won out. Although, of course, Aristotle
2166640	2171920	disagreed in certain ways, he was still largely a Platonist, you know, the agreement between Aristotle
2171920	2178960	and Plato is much greater than the disagreement. And so Aristotle gets kind of more credit,
2178960	2186000	perhaps because, as Alexander spread Hellenism, you know, Aristotle had a pride of place for a
2186000	2194160	couple centuries, and then later Platonism had a resurgence. So, you know, there's an argument
2194160	2201840	to be made that maybe Aristotle contributed more in certain respects than Plato. Again,
2201840	2207440	I'm kind of digressing from your point. But yeah, I think Plato is trying to harmonize the currents
2207440	2212960	of his day, and save the gods and save his traditional ways of worship, and at the same time,
2212960	2217120	arrive at the truth underlying reality. It's like this nihilism that you mentioned,
2218240	2222080	you can't just want the world to be a certain way, and then like,
2222080	2227040	blind yourself to what may actually be out there. You can't know the nature of underlying
2227040	2232800	reality unless you question these basic concepts. If you just presume that there are no universals,
2232800	2238080	there are only particulars, and realities, this basic flux, like, why do you think that,
2239200	2244080	how do you justify that? If you're going to try to build a rationalistic framework,
2244080	2247920	you're going to have to basically go along with what Plato did. Plato was the first one to do it
2247920	2253840	in a serious way, the Pythagoreans, and then Plato. And there's, everyone kind of followed in his
2253840	2260000	train because there's probably one true nature to reality. And, you know, this is the perennial
2260000	2266240	philosophy idea, you're not going to digress from that very far. And so if Plato put it adequately,
2266880	2272480	then kind of have to take the tools that you're given. And Plato is very traditional for us.
2272480	2278720	I mean, you can't understand modern Western civilization without him. So, yeah.
2278720	2285520	Yeah, Platonism is, it is the kind of metaphysics of the perennial philosophy. I mean,
2286480	2291920	I think Shu'an of the traditional school basically considered neoplatonism,
2292880	2298000	like kind of a divine revelation to the West, like it's the Western version of the perennial
2298000	2302880	philosophy. But you mentioned Pythagoras. I remember, I don't know if you saw,
2303920	2309920	like a decade ago, they supposedly uncovered that there was like a secret Pythagorean message
2309920	2315760	in the Republic that every 12 lines, there was a mention of music and they were speculating that
2315760	2321120	you could, you could create like musical notes out of out of messages he'd inserted in there
2321120	2327760	with numbers. And that this was a sign that Plato was like a secret Pythagorean because the Pythagorean
2327760	2335200	sect was persecuted at the time. Now Pythagoras, you know, obviously like the vegetarianism and
2335200	2341280	some of his ideas, I think there is a popular idea that he got his philosophy from India, right,
2341280	2348560	that he traveled to India and he kind of brought back Vedanta. There's also, I don't know if this
2348560	2354480	is confirmed, but there's also theories that Plato took his philosophy from like mystery schools in
2354480	2362320	Egypt. So do you have any insight in terms of like kind of like an esoteric element to Plato or
2362320	2368800	kind of a religious origin of his teachings? Or, you know, is the similarities to the perennial
2368800	2373520	philosophy? Is that just kind of a testament to, you know, reason brings you to this system if you
2373520	2381920	follow it fair enough? Yeah, my basic model of the axial age as a whole is that it diffuses from
2381920	2388400	the Punjab basically. The Upanishadic philosophy originates around year 1000 BC,
2389040	2395200	and then we see movements towards rationalistic, I mean, Upanishads are written in dialogue form,
2395200	2404080	that's healthy something, many of them. So these ideas of perennialism I see is coming out of India
2404080	2411840	primarily, although there may be more ancient, similar systems out of Egypt. So like we have
2411840	2417120	to remember this time period in the aftermath of the Bronze Age collapse, right? There was a
2417760	2426960	2000 year long civilization from 3000 BC to 1000 BC, very roughly speaking, that was on a larger
2426960	2434880	scale in many ways, better organized than the state of things in the Greek Dark Ages, for example,
2434880	2441760	which is the times that, you know, classical antiquity comes out of. And those Bronze Age
2441760	2448320	civilizations had a common source, right? Prior to the civilizations properly speaking, there were
2448320	2458640	advanced, you know, city based cultures in Syria, in Iraq, you know, the Fertile Crescent, and,
2459520	2465200	you know, in Egypt, starting around 5000 BC, arguably a little bit older, but going all the way back
2465200	2470480	to 10,000 BC. And this happens with the spread of Neolithic technologies generally, they're
2470480	2475440	identifiable gene clusters that are associated with this, that we are related to in many ways. So
2475440	2480720	like a lot of people want to go back to the Bronze Age and learn as Aryans or whatever. But like
2480720	2488720	we're also this kind of ancient Neolithic, Neolithicizing force, like a third of our
2488720	2494640	ancestry is associated with that Anatolian hunter-gatherer population that was integral to the
2494640	2501040	spread of the Neolithic. And it's that bundle of technologies that seeded what would later become
2501040	2512080	the civilizations in southern Iran, in the Indus Valley, so Indus Valley civilization. And I imagine
2512080	2517040	that, I mean, they were all in contact, there was trade between the Indus Valley civilization
2517040	2524720	and Egypt via, you know, Fertile Crescent intermediaries. But ideas spread during that whole
2524720	2532640	preceding arc of civilization. So it may be then that what we see coming out of Upanishadic
2532640	2540960	philosophy is really a resurgence of older Indus Valley traditions, not that all of them, all of
2540960	2548720	the beliefs of Vedanta come out of that. Obviously, the rest of the Vedas are still significant, the
2548720	2558160	ritual forms, the ideas contained in the older sections of the four Vedas matter religiously to
2558160	2565760	Hindus. But some of these ideas, like maybe reincarnation, although there are some Indo-European
2565760	2572960	precedents, it's far from a settled matter. But yoga, for example, I would say very likely comes
2572960	2577520	from the Indus Valley civilization complex rather than an Indo-European innovation.
2578560	2585200	So maybe some of what we see in Plato that looks Indian, I mean, that's what I recognize,
2585200	2589200	that's why I was able to understand Plato as well as I was when I first read it. You know,
2589200	2593760	I got into the Neoplatonist later, I read Plato directly, and I saw it basically through a lens
2593760	2598480	of Vedanta, and it made sense through that lens fairly easily. Like a lot of the ideas are the
2598480	2603280	same up to and including the tripartite soul, you have basically, you know, intellect,
2604000	2610640	thumos, epithumia, or appetite, which equates to Satva, Rajas, and Thomas in Hinduism.
2611760	2619120	So anyway, some of this stuff that looks Indian might just be the ancient Bronze Age layer
2619120	2626800	that Plato and Pythagoras got from Egypt, from the Chaldeans, you know, the Syrians basically.
2627600	2635120	And there's, you know, one more esoteric aspect here that might be in the background,
2635120	2639680	which is Plato's idea of Atlantis. And if you look at the beginning of the Neolithic,
2640560	2645040	I have a four-part series on prehistory, the fourth part deals with, you know,
2645040	2651200	the emergence of civilization. It's probably the most condensed anthropology lecture you could watch
2651200	2658160	on that period of time from like 15,000 BC down to 3000 BC. A lot happens, you know, and we're not
2658160	2664000	sure how these developments take place, or why, and why they're so fast, why they're so concentrated
2664000	2670080	in one particular region, like how the people who built Gobekli Tapu, for example, learned how to
2670080	2675120	deal with megaliths overnight, and then they got worse at it, which is not what you would expect,
2675120	2681200	right, if they just came out of a hunter-gatherer society. So people have often speculated that
2681200	2688400	there was a more advanced civilization prior to the Younger Dryas, which runs from, you know,
2688400	2698080	basically 11,000 to 10,000 or 9,500 BC. And that was a kind of mini ice age. So it had been warming up
2698640	2705920	from 20,000 years ago until, you know, 13,000 years ago. And it's very likely that, you know,
2705920	2710400	just as with the Holocene warming, we saw the emergence of larger populations, you know,
2710400	2716000	larger settlements, you had a similar thing happen at the end of the Upper Paleolithic.
2716000	2721040	And then that was upset by the Younger Dryas very suddenly, you know, in a matter of decades,
2721040	2726480	the temperature dropped, you know, five, six degrees globally, something really extreme.
2728160	2733280	And that lines up with the timeframe that Plato actually gives for the myth of Atlantis.
2735040	2739360	So, I mean, you can make of that what you will. I give credit to those theories of an
2739360	2744560	advanced ancient civilization, because there are archaeological anomalies that just have
2744560	2749360	no explanation whatsoever. You can obviously ignore those like the Baalbek,
2750000	2759120	Megalith, or some of the structures in Egypt that seem to predate other structured people
2759120	2765040	speculate about a date of the Sphinx being older. You know, I'm not sure about each particular piece
2765040	2770480	of evidence, but an expert in archaeology, but there are many such sites. There's a Megalith
2771200	2777040	underwater between Sicily and Italy, I think, and no one knows. It seems to be 13,000 years old,
2777040	2783200	no one knows who built it or how. Some of these anomalies that point to the possibility of some
2783200	2790480	advanced culture, we could go further into that obviously, but it's a long digression. But if
2790480	2796080	there was this ancient high civilization, they just think about what kind of technology they
2796080	2802160	would have developed. They were different genetically than later peoples. They had higher Neanderthal
2802160	2807120	admixture, and the structure of the Neanderthal brain was quite different. Their cerebellum was
2807120	2816240	larger, the human, the Homo sapiens, cerebrum is larger. Neanderthals were very intuitive in
2816240	2822240	their ways of doing things. The forms of their tools didn't change very much over hundreds of
2822240	2827120	thousands of years, and yet they were successful. We have a hard time replicating their tools.
2827680	2833520	It was like they had an extreme ability to get the knack of something. What humans are good at
2833520	2838880	is innovating and thinking analytically and combining things in different ways, whereas the
2838880	2843760	Neanderthals kind of felled their channel and their groove and really just settled into it.
2843760	2848480	So that might have been more like the way of thinking of this ancient high civilization,
2849040	2856880	and people speculate whether it had something to do with acoustics, the rise of advanced
2856880	2864160	upper Paleolithic cultures in Europe coincides with the first musical instruments. Many of the
2864160	2871200	important ritual sites are also coincidentally caves that have great acoustics. So you could
2871200	2877760	speculate some kind of acoustic-based technology in the upper Paleolithic, culminating in a high
2877760	2883760	civilization that maybe did have an empire, basically, like Plato says that Atlantis had,
2883760	2889040	and then it was rapidly destroyed by the onset of the Younger Dryas, which may or may not have been
2889040	2893360	started by a comet. Right now, the evidence does look like it started with a comet.
2893360	2899440	So that's the most esoteric side of Platonism, is Platonism through the Pythagoreans that he knew
2899440	2905040	and through his own travels. He traveled for 10 years after Socrates died. So Plato himself may
2905040	2912080	have actually made it to India. So there is probably some Indian wisdom in there, some vestigial
2912080	2918960	bronze age wisdom via the Chaldeans and via the Egyptians, and then perhaps this most ancient layer,
2920080	2923280	which we can only speculate about, but it is fun to speculate about that.
2925120	2932880	Yeah, I used to be really into Atlantis archaeology stuff as well. I think the most
2932880	2940400	interesting angle is there was a guy, Schwaller de Lubitz, who was like an Egyptologist and a mystic.
2941280	2947520	And he inspired John Anthony West, who's a really good book on Egypt called Serpent in the Sky,
2947520	2953680	where he gets into like the cosmology of the ancient Egyptians and how that was reflected in
2955680	2964400	their architecture. But he speculated that, both of them speculated that the Sphinx was like eroded
2964400	2972800	by water. It's the back when there was rain in the Sahara Desert. The second guy West actually
2972800	2978000	hired this guy called Robert Schock, who is like a geologist who's an expert in stuff to actually
2978000	2985040	study the pattern of erosion on the Sphinx. And he did conclude that it was from rainfall,
2985040	2993280	and he actually ended up dating it to like 9,700 BC, which was the date when Plato gave for
2994400	3000560	the fall of Atlantis. So yeah, there's a lot of interest in esoteric red pills there.
3001120	3006880	But yeah, I mean, I guess to get into like the sort of meat and bones of Platonism,
3008640	3013440	obviously, you know, one thing you've touched on a bit and that people obviously associate most
3013440	3019920	of Plato is this idea of the forms. Now, just before we get into it, I mean, can you give like a
3019920	3025120	basic background of why does Plato propose the forms in the first place? And how do they
3025840	3030800	help him make sense of the world in a way that he thinks other philosophers are missing?
3033440	3041120	Right. Well, a lot of it is tied to the ethical focus of Socrates, right? I think if you read
3041120	3048800	Xenophon, Socrates does come across as more of this strictly moral philosopher. Plato maybe puts
3048800	3055360	a bit more Pythagoreanism into the mouth of Socrates than Socrates actually held to. But
3055360	3061120	the way we are introduced to the concept of the forms through the dialogues is often Socrates
3062000	3071680	asking about the nature of something like wisdom, or just virtue in general, and trying to get down
3071680	3080080	to what actually is this that we're talking about. If there are only particular
3080720	3087600	virtuous men, but no true virtue, then the idea that there are particular virtuous men becomes
3087600	3094000	vacuous, right? If you're going to take the existence of good seriously, if there is such a
3094000	3100240	thing, if there is justice, they have to have some kind of metaphysical status, right? Like,
3100240	3112080	it's nonsense to ascribe a label to a particular society or man unless that label has a meaning.
3112080	3120560	Like, what is it ultimately referring to? This gets fleshed out kind of analogically with
3121520	3130240	math, right? We have to believe that there is some perfect circle, because we never, like,
3130240	3135600	where do we get the idea of perfect circularity? We can mathematically define it precisely,
3135600	3141120	up to the point where you get the value of Pi coming out of it, which is irrational and goes on
3141120	3147840	infinitely. So infinite, potentially infinite specification of this perfect circle. And yet,
3148720	3156160	we don't see that in the empirical world anywhere. There's just, you know, there's no way of making
3156160	3165360	sense of the labels that we apply to universal phenomena, moral concepts like justice or courage
3165360	3173760	or things like that, or mathematical phenomena. So it's really, in the dialogues, it's presented
3173760	3181040	in terms of, well, we're trying to explain what this thing is that people in common parliaments
3181040	3186320	are referring to. You can keep it at that level and just say, well, this is the way people use
3186320	3192640	this word. But if you never trace it back to some universal property or universal characteristic
3192640	3197760	that all of these particulars actually have, and that universal has an independent ontological
3197760	3204480	status, then there's no accounting for the similarity of the particulars. Why does the
3204480	3211280	linguistic reference work? That is what nominalists miss. So, like, the thing is, we don't actually
3211280	3217600	get great arguments for the theory of forms in many of Plato's dialogues. He leaves it at this
3217600	3225120	kind of rudimentary stage. And many people would say the reason for that is that Plato reserved
3226080	3233280	the more Pythagorean doctrines for his inner circle, for the people within the walls of the academy.
3234000	3244080	And Thomas Taylor, the 18th and 19th century Platonist, wrote a book on Aristotle, where he
3244080	3250160	basically said that Aristotle, just like Plato, was actually cloaking his real ideas, and that
3250160	3256800	this was a tradition that went back to the Greek sages, to the Presocratics as well. It was viewed
3256800	3265360	as taboo, for example, to expose the goings-on of the mystery cults. You couldn't tell people what
3265360	3275440	happened at the mysteries of Lucis. And so similarly, because the philosophy of the Ionians comes out of
3275440	3280560	a culture where these mystery schools had this preeminent place, the philosophy was tied with
3280560	3288160	the doctrines of the mystery schools. And so certain elements of philosophy then were, you know, not
3288960	3293920	for the masses. They were not for mass consumption, not for the Voipalloi. So, Aristotle cloaked his
3293920	3303760	ideas through this kind of very dense and hard to parse prose, which is unprecedented in literary
3303760	3308640	history, like the way that Aristotle wrote is unique. And he didn't just write that way because
3308640	3313680	he was autistic, although it seems like he probably was, but because he was trying to cloak
3313680	3318640	the kind of core metaphysical doctrines that he was actually talking around in some way,
3319200	3326480	according to Thomas Taylor. Plato also cloaked his ideas by putting, you know, some parts of the
3326480	3330880	core doctrine in one character's mouth, and then another part of the core doctrine in the
3330880	3337760	mouth of Socrates and leaving the picture incomplete, often ending the dialogue in Aporia.
3337760	3342960	And so this is a criticism that people will make of the theory of forms is that, well, exactly how
3342960	3350160	does participation work? You know, what's the dynamic here ultimately? And the answer is it's
3350160	3357520	actually a very complex technical system that you can abstract out of it. Proclus wrote a commentary
3357520	3363920	on the Parmenides that spells this out. Nicholas of Cusa said that this was the most important
3363920	3369280	book in the history of philosophy. Parmenides comment, sorry, Proclus' commentary on the
3369280	3373360	Parmenides. But then on the other hand, Schopenhauer said it was the most tedious book in the world.
3373360	3381760	So, you know, take that for what you will. But in this commentary, he, Proclus, spells out that
3382320	3388960	Parmenides is not, as it first appears, just shooting down Socrates' theory of forms. In the
3388960	3395920	dialogue, Socrates is young in his early 20s, maybe Zeno is about 40, and then Parmenides is older,
3395920	3402720	60, 70, or something like that. And Socrates listens to the arguments of Zeno for monism,
3402720	3408640	basically. Zeno argues against multiplicity. Parmenides argues for unity. It's two sides of
3408640	3414160	the same coin, and they represent the same basic philosophy, which is an offshoot of Pythagoreanism
3414160	3420320	itself. And so if you read the Parmenides, which is very difficult to read, it's not
3420960	3424800	like the other dialogues in a lot of ways. The beginning is easy enough, and then it gets into
3424800	3432320	these long chains where Parmenides is meant to explicate the dialectical method. And it proceeds
3432320	3437680	in a kind of mathematical way where you look at the kind of hypothesis, and then it's opposite,
3437680	3443520	and then another set of opposites. And so you just get very lost in all of these considerations,
3443520	3449120	like if there is no one, then there is the very high level of abstraction the whole time. So it's
3449120	3454320	like, I read it the first time before I had read Proclas, and I basically just gave up trying to
3454320	3459920	understand it about halfway through. I think anyone who's honest with themselves will say-
3459920	3462720	Yeah, me too. I never finished Parmenides.
3462720	3469040	No. Yeah, it's a different kind of thing. Well, Proclas makes it clearer. And so at face value,
3469040	3473760	it seems like Parmenides is shooting down Socrates' theory, but what he's actually doing is pointing
3473760	3478800	out that Socrates needs to introduce certain kind of fine distinctions, subtle distinctions in
3478800	3486800	theory of forms to make them work. And the core doctrine that Proclas argues for in his commentary
3486800	3493040	is the idea that there is the the unitive and imperticipable aspect of the form where they
3493040	3498880	exist in themselves in the same way that like, you know, in physics, the Schrödinger equation,
3498880	3505440	the universal wave function kind of has its own form and existence eternally. It's a standing wave
3506880	3514320	and particular things relate to it, relativistically, but it is this permanent reality. Well, the forms
3514320	3520720	have to have an element like that. It's not that the forms extend like the analogy that Socrates
3520720	3525600	ends up using is actually, I think Parmenides provides it for Socrates in the dialogue, but is
3525600	3532800	like, okay, so the form of justice is like a sail, you know, a big piece of cloth that spreads over
3532800	3537280	many particular men and touches them all. And Socrates is like, yeah, I guess it's something
3537280	3543840	like that. But that doesn't work because it doesn't preserve the unity of this one thing
3543840	3549600	that you're referring to, because obviously, the entire cloth has extension. So like, if the forms
3549600	3556960	are only in particulars, that, you know, looks like Aristotle's hyalomorphism, then how it doesn't
3556960	3563360	actually get you any closer to explaining this unitary characteristic that is seen in the multiplicity.
3563360	3568400	That's the basic problem of the forms. How do you account for the similarity, the oneness
3568400	3573200	in multiplicity? There has to be an element of the forms that is unitive, that is exempt,
3573200	3577280	and for Plato, that does basically exist in a kind of realm independent of this realm.
3578640	3583920	And this realm is dependent on it. And so it's not exactly that there's like a separate realm
3583920	3588400	of forms, and then this realm, it's rather that this realm is an outgrowth of the realm of forms.
3590000	3595680	And so there's a prior ontological status to these universals in the same way that there's a
3595680	3601600	prior ontological status to the Schrodinger equation, or whatever medium it describes,
3601600	3607520	right? The ether is older than any particular configuration of matter, let's say. Another
3607520	3613760	analogy might be like in chess, you know, a particular position on the board, when like
3613760	3620000	Nakamura and Carlson are playing, hasn't been reached before, it's still real, but it's not
3620000	3626640	as essential to chess as like the way that the knight moves, or the number of squares on the board.
3626720	3632960	Those more fundamental, more syntactic, more internal features of chess have a prior ontological
3632960	3641040	reality. The particular position reached in Nakamura v. Carlson is dependent on the way
3641040	3645520	that the knight moves, and the number of squares, and stuff like that. So you have to have this
3645520	3652400	prior ontological status to general syntactic features of reality. Otherwise, good luck trying
3652400	3658800	to explain how similarity works, how the laws of physics work, where they subsist, why math
3658800	3664160	describes the world. It's just like there's really no coherent rational picture you can
3664160	3670240	make unless you take this leap of saying, yes, there is an independent ontological status to
3670240	3676720	these universal characteristics, which we describe and indicate in particulars in the world.
3677040	3684000	All right, so if I just like play the nominalist for a minute, I mean,
3684880	3692160	you could say why do the forms have to exist outside of our sort of shared abstraction?
3694400	3699120	Well, the question is, why did we come to that shared abstraction? The question is,
3699120	3704720	why does the abstraction work? It seems like nominalists always just ignore that question,
3705280	3712880	like it doesn't get you any closer. Well, in the case of, like I said, we look at the form of
3712880	3720320	hoarseness. Perhaps they would argue that with what we know about evolution, species are much more
3721360	3725520	in flux, so we might recognize, and there's kind of intermediary species, and there isn't really
3725520	3733680	a final end for species. There isn't a final hoarseness. So we're seeing many particular
3733760	3740480	instances of horses, but what would a perfect horse be in that scenario? You could say like the
3740480	3745760	most adaptive horse, but then that's like different, you could say for each horse dependent on like
3745760	3755440	their geographical location or something. Yeah, well, that kind of raises the question of whether
3756080	3765520	this system, this evolutionary context, had from the outset certain states, certain stable states
3765520	3771680	that it could reach, right? If you're tied to like an a theory of time, if you're tied to like the
3771680	3777840	world just is what's happening right now, and there's no eternal reality whatsoever, then you
3777840	3784720	can try to skirt this question. But you'll be, if you try to do that, you'll be left with no theory
3784720	3791040	of counterfactuals. David Lewis, contemporary philosopher, put forward the theory of modal
3791040	3797680	realism to account for the truth status of counterfactual propositions. Statements like if
3797680	3804320	Johnny had made the last basket, his team would have won the game, that can be true, like we can
3804320	3809920	all recognize that that's true, but what is the referent? What is it that makes that statement
3809920	3816000	true if there's no counterfactual thing that is being referred to? So Lewis just bites the bullet
3816000	3821040	and like accepts the, yeah, these other worlds are out there. But anyway, what that allows you to do
3821040	3827120	then in terms of identifying species is say that, okay, there is this evolutionary matrix, there's
3827120	3832000	certain patterns of behavior that themselves have a universal reality, like evolution itself
3832000	3837200	is a universal phenomenon. Okay, now where's that in the nominalist picture? Like again,
3837200	3840640	any time you try to justify nominalism, you're going to have to fall back on
3840640	3846480	some realist concept to ground it, because pure nominalism just dissolves into nonsense,
3846480	3852000	because there can't be any like true reference ultimately, because things are changing too much.
3852000	3859520	But anyway, you can say that there is a stable state within an evolutionary system by comparing
3859520	3866320	all of the possible paths of evolution. And then you can describe basically as we do in quantum
3866320	3873920	mechanics, a wave function that has the kind of probability of this stable outcome, which will
3873920	3880480	have a particular center, there will be an archetypal member of the species that like most closely
3881200	3887680	approximates that stable state that can find that stable solution, you know, evolution,
3887680	3893760	it's their objective features that allow you to either succeed or fail. And you have those
3893760	3898720	features or not. And they are there are a set of features that for a given environment are that
3898720	3905840	most stable position. And we do see in evolutionary systems, not this gradual transformation between
3905840	3914400	infinite intermediary forms. Instead, we see people and species locking into these stable types,
3915040	3921840	archetypes that work, you know, geometrically, in terms of blood flow, like their physical
3921920	3930400	constraints that define a range of variables. And there are stable, you know, values for that
3930400	3935920	those sets of variables and unstable values. And again, across the spectrum of all possible worlds
3935920	3940400	in which this evolutionary context happens, you can draw that kind of probability distribution,
3940400	3946400	which will have a center on one ideal, most stable structure.
3946400	3955120	All right, as far as let's say as far as it's applied to morality, like the
3956080	3963200	you're talking about justice. So, you know, perhaps the modern nominalist would would say that
3964400	3969760	your argument is kind of similar to the nature in one earlier, and that you're kind of pleading
3969760	3976000	that well, you know, we need to have an objective morality, like it would be terrible if we didn't.
3976000	3981680	So, you know, there needs to be some objective form of justice. And then, you know, they could
3981680	3986720	come in with the evolutionary psychology and that kind of thing and say that these are just
3986720	3990640	adaptive behaviors and whatnot. And you're trying to abstract that into something objective.
3993760	4002160	Yeah, right. Well, the Plato is moralizing is very different from deontological moralizing.
4002160	4008720	It's really like a statement of the matter of fact, like the way that Plato disproves
4008720	4015760	Thrasomachus' claim in the Republic that justice does not always align with individual advantage
4015760	4020160	that actually sometimes like its base to be just because you're just following basically
4020160	4025200	falling for the slave morality of your time instead of like transcending and looking after
4025200	4032640	your own individual benefit. But so you get down to an analysis of what exactly is meant
4033360	4040640	by advantage, what is meant by the good of a particular actor. And the so an issue with
4040640	4046720	platonic definitions, because he presumes there is this realm of stable archetypes out there,
4047280	4053600	then we should be able to cut up our definitions to correspond to these like consistent features.
4054160	4060960	And justice, for example, he defines in terms of the alignment of the three aspects of the soul
4061680	4069040	where you are in charge of your lower nature. So platonic reasoning in the dialogues is often
4069040	4073440	kind of messy because he's appealing to the particular preconceptions of the people that
4073440	4078960	he's interacting with. That's like Socrates' Mayutic method. He takes people from where they are,
4079520	4083920	uses the concessions that they make from their current state of knowledge and then draws them
4083920	4089360	kind of upward from there. And so you don't get these like apodictically certain perfect
4089360	4098320	demonstrations in the dialogues, more like what Aristotle sometimes aims at. But yeah,
4098320	4106400	so this definition of justice just eliminates the possibility that you can be benefited while
4106400	4112480	being unjust. Because like, do you care about your possessions? Do you care about your body? Or
4112480	4118960	do you care about the state of your soul? All other mental states, whether pleasant or painful,
4118960	4125360	depend on that configuration of soul in the first place. And if you accept that there is a best
4125360	4132640	state of soul, to facilitate your own kind of proper enjoyment, which I think everyone accepts,
4132640	4139840	there's like preferable mental states, preferable ways of thinking that lead to greater happiness,
4139840	4147600	then justice is going to be the way to attain that unity within yourself. So it's really that
4148560	4154320	he's giving a theory of what justice is, where these notions come from, because it can't be
4154320	4159120	convention all the way down, right? It doesn't make sense. Again, going back to like an evolutionary
4159120	4165920	context, in the set of all possible worlds where societies evolve, there are going to be stable
4165920	4170960	structures that equate to some underlying feature of the nature of reality, and then there will be
4170960	4176320	unstable structures. When evolution gets it right, when social evolution gets it right, and morality
4176320	4183840	equates to this dharmic structure, which you could say is the kind of archetype standing behind the
4183840	4188800	particular instantiation when it gets it right, it's stable. When it gets it wrong, it fails.
4189760	4197920	So justice is a more claim of like a matter of fact, not we should have this, but you won't be
4197920	4203600	happy unless you are just, and justice means each part of your soul doing its proper business,
4204480	4210960	right? So if you don't accept that, then the claim will be that you will just suffer as a result.
4210960	4216160	It's not that you need this justice, it's that you don't know what advantage actually is, and if
4216160	4220480	you studied it methodically, and really evaluated what you mean by what is good for you, like if
4220480	4224000	you want to make a consequentialist argument against Platonism and say that it leads to too much
4224000	4228640	extraction, and actually it's not going to help your nation. Okay, well, what is going to help
4228640	4234560	your nation? What is advantageous for your nation? That is a philosophical question that you can either
4234560	4240000	presume that you already know, or you can investigate it. And if you investigate it, the
4240000	4243920	contention would be if you properly investigated it, you would eventually come down to this
4243920	4252080	Platonic theory of value of the good, of justice, of these particular moral qualities that people
4252080	4262560	instantiate. Yeah, I don't really understand the argument that, you know, that evolution
4263280	4268960	would kind of necessarily, that it would end up aligning our moral sensibilities with,
4269680	4272240	you know, what's what's deramik, or what's objectively right?
4275360	4282400	Right, well, the claim would be that there has to be an equivalence at some level, or correspondence,
4282400	4290480	let's say, between the features, the objective features of reality, and the states that an
4290480	4298000	evolutionary system takes up. So if you are not in line with the nature of reality, you're obviously
4298000	4302960	going to make mistakes, right, your knowledge will not be well grounded, your behaviors will
4302960	4310400	not be adaptive, adaptive behaviors will survive in a greater number of contexts overall than
4310400	4316240	unadaptive behaviors. So it's perhaps, it's not right to say that evolution leads to
4317360	4325280	moral perfection, or, you know, correct moral behavior all the time. But in order to survive,
4325280	4330560	there has to be some correspondence between the way you're behaving and the structure of reality,
4330560	4335920	right, your karma, individual conduct is tied to the dharma of your society, which is tied to the
4335920	4343440	art or underlying nature of physical reality. These have to correspond, right, and particular
4343440	4351040	evolutionary states will accord with that like proper dharma, or they'll deviate from it. And
4351120	4356560	the claim is, if you deviate from that proper dharma, from that like stable evolutionary condition,
4356560	4363920	then you're going to be selected out eventually. Yeah, I just don't see how that leads to
4366720	4372800	an argument for, like, an objective justice and morality within that, because, you know,
4372800	4378480	why can't it just be like adaptive behavior all the way down, right? Why does there have to be
4378480	4383520	any objective content to, you know, the good behavior that results from that?
4385200	4391360	Well, what's objective in it has to do, again, with that structure of underlying reality.
4392480	4398960	So because there are only so many viable states, an evolutionary system can take up
4399840	4408320	and survive, that constrains the range of what is going to be considered adaptive.
4409680	4416880	That what is adaptive is tied to the nature of reality at base. Now, you know, couldn't it be
4416880	4423200	that what led to thriving, what led to survival of evolutionary systems had no moral content?
4423200	4427760	Well, the definition of morality we're coming up with here has to do with
4427840	4432320	advantage, not evolutionary advantage, primarily. I mean, primarily, we're looking at
4432320	4437920	individual experience. And when we talk about the benefit of individuals, it's in phenomenological
4437920	4444160	terms, whereas in populations, we're talking about the benefit in genetic terms, you know. So
4444160	4449680	it's kind of taking it out of its proper context. But we're saying, like, the claim is that what is
4449680	4457200	adaptive is simply what's right. At the level of evolutionary systems, that applies, like,
4457200	4462080	the proper Dharma is going to lead to flourishing of your community. And there is a proper Dharma,
4462080	4467280	there is a way of doing that. So that's objective. Right. And then also at the level of the individual,
4467280	4471600	if you think that you can reject the platonic concept of justice, and you can,
4471600	4477280	and temperance, and you can let appetite run out of hand, and not rein it in with reason,
4477280	4481920	and that'll be successful. Platonists would just say, no, you're just wrong. You're not going to
4481920	4488800	be successful if you do that. So morality is, like, tied to advantage. That's the step that
4488800	4494000	Socrates takes in reasoning in a few different dialogues, including the Alcibiades, which my
4494000	4500880	reading group just went through. Does that make it any clearer? I mean, to work out the apparent...
4500880	4505760	Well, it's just as soon as you tell it to what's adaptive, can't you just get really
4505760	4512640	consequentialist about that? And, you know, maybe torturing babies from the other tribe
4512640	4519440	is most adaptive for our immediate benefit, right? I mean, it just seems like as soon as you tie,
4520160	4526960	as soon as you try and tie an objective good to what's adaptive, it just seems like, you know,
4526960	4531360	everything is in flux at that point. Yeah, if you kept, that's why I mentioned this kind of
4531360	4537920	distinction between evolutionary benefit, which is itself based on abstractions, like the gene
4537920	4544000	itself is an abstraction. There's no single material entity that equates to a gene. The gene
4544000	4551360	is defined differently depending on the context in evolutionary biology. So genes are an abstraction
4551360	4557520	already. And the kind of evolutionary context is within a set of mental parameters of human
4557520	4563680	theory, right? The reality is more well integrated than that, right? The individual morality component,
4563680	4570080	the well-being of the soul of the creatures in these populations also factors into adaptivity.
4570080	4577680	So our reductionistic material description of what is adaptive is incomplete. And like, you
4577680	4582880	can't just think of morality in terms of evolutionary benefit. You also have to integrate it with the
4582880	4590720	well-being of the individual soul. And I think what gets the, like, what is objective there,
4590720	4595760	and not just hedonism, is where you get into this idea of the independence of the soul,
4595760	4601200	making arguments for the fact that the human being is not the body. The human being isn't even the
4601200	4607920	combination of the soul and the body. The human being uses the body to do his work. We could run
4607920	4612080	through different thought experiments. We can demonstrate that. Plato has several arguments,
4612080	4616800	but once you accept that the human being is the soul, and if you accept that the soul is
4616800	4620880	immortal, which many people don't today, right? Because they haven't really dealt with this
4621600	4626800	concept sufficiently, in my opinion. You know, I have my own arguments that I've developed. Plato
4626800	4634480	has arguments. But once you take that step, then the consequences go beyond just an individual
4635360	4642880	life filled with hedonic experiences. It goes into the structure of the soul that you are
4642880	4650160	building through your action. And I think just empirically, that comes across in what makes
4650160	4655520	people successful. Like, people who simply pursue immediate pleasure, if that's our concept of
4655520	4662320	advantage here, are generally less happy on the whole than the people who structure their psyches,
4662320	4669280	who like, do hard work to enforce justice in their own soul. Those people, whatever happens,
4669280	4675840	they will be more resilient. Because the way that you experience whatever happens in the
4675840	4680960	mundane world is filtered through the structure of your psyche. And so if you can build a positive
4680960	4686640	structure into yourself, align the structure of your mind with the structure of reality,
4686720	4692480	like through this logistic on through like logos guiding the rest of your activities,
4693040	4698000	then you'll just be more content overall. It doesn't have this kind of ultimate moral force
4698000	4703200	unless you speculate about consequences after death. And that's why like, all of these facets
4703200	4712640	have to be combined in order to make sense of Plato's equivocation between advantage and justice.
4712640	4718720	So basically, when people make the claim that in any particular case, what is really just differs
4718720	4724080	from what is really advantageous, that's evidence for Plato that you just don't actually understand
4724080	4732320	what justice really is or what advantage really is. Right. So there's, there's no like,
4733120	4740320	Kantian idea that, you know, there's no like contrast between doing what's right and doing
4740320	4744800	what's good for yourself. In a way, like you're always kind of pursuing your own good when you
4744800	4751680	pursue the good. But so just back to the idea of the forms, right. So the way you were kind of
4751680	4757200	speaking about the merrier and when you kind of contrast it with Aristotle. So it sounds like
4757200	4761760	you do have kind of a view of like, so there's like, there's, you know, there's different
4761760	4766480	interpretations of Plato, but there's a kind of two worlds interpretation of Plato that the forms
4767360	4774960	exist in like another realm, so to speak. The book I'm reading currently is a book called
4774960	4779520	Thinking Bean by Eric Pearl. You actually passed me on the recommendation from someone else,
4779520	4784400	but he basically totally rejects this and says that this is a bad reading of Plato.
4785440	4789920	And that in a way, like the way we commonly interpret Aristotle, he kind of attributes
4789920	4795600	that to Plato and he says that Plato and Aristotle didn't really disagree at all on the nature of
4795600	4800400	the forms. And then this passed on to Plotinus and Thomas Aquinas. He says there's like a
4801600	4805360	kind of a straight thread the whole way through. But it's sort of like the way you were talking
4805360	4812160	about the forms that you do accept more of like a sort of two worlds interpretation. So like,
4812160	4817280	what is the nature of the forms? Are they on kind of a higher level of reality?
4818640	4823040	Yeah, I would say they are on a higher level of reality, but it's not two separate worlds. It's
4823040	4831200	more like the world branches from a root in the one, and then through the highest level
4831200	4838400	categories and forms and the gods also and Plotinism, and then through specific differentiated
4838400	4844640	structures. I would say if you're going to have a rational model of the world, it's going to have
4844640	4852000	to look something like this with unity at the top to explain generic similarity of higher level
4852000	4859360	features of reality, and then descending through particulars to more contingent, less ontologically
4859360	4867040	fundamental aspects of the world. So our world here is less fundamental than those highest level
4867040	4873680	features of the world. I mean, any particular state of a system is less ontologically fundamental
4873680	4879280	than the syntactic arrangement of that system itself, the laws of the syntactic medium. That
4879280	4885520	has to be prior. Particular states of any system are inconceivable unless there's some kind of
4886160	4895120	previous order to the syntactic medium in which those states subsist. So it's not exactly there's
4895120	4901920	two separate worlds. It's that there is, I mean, ultimately kind of one fundamental reality,
4901920	4908960	the one contains the rest of being and the separation and distinctions that we observe
4908960	4915440	are perspectives on that being and don't have a kind of fundamental independent ontological
4915440	4922240	existence. You know, our perceptions now aren't fundamentally grounded in the way that the one
4922240	4931040	is. Like obviously, it's inevitable that we exist, we are here, but are in order for our being to be
4931040	4936560	there higher level features have to be the laws of physics have to be there. You know, other features
4936560	4942080	of the world, the nature of soul in general has to be there, like a particular soul can't exist
4942080	4948320	unless the structure of reality is such that this nature of soul does actually subsist in some way.
4948960	4954000	Otherwise, what is that soul that we're talking about the ontology will have the only alternative
4954000	4960240	is to make a totally bottom up ontology. And then once you take that step higher level theorizing
4960240	4967760	really just becomes impossible. And it's not that like I rule out on foundationalist grounds,
4967760	4972480	that kind of inductivist bottom up approach, it's that it's never been demonstrated to build a
4972480	4978160	comprehensive model and Platonism has, you know, like Plato, for example, said the world may be
4978160	4986080	in the shape of a dodecahedron. And, you know, in 2003, French team, analyzing, you know,
4986080	4991040	the background microwave radiation imaging said that, you know, you can make sense of
4991040	4995840	certain patterns in the background radiation by saying that the universe actually has the shape
4995840	5002960	of a dodecahedron, or like the idea of the platonic solids providing a groundwork for the
5002960	5009280	five elements in the Temaeus, you know, the tetrahedron being equivalent to fire and so forth.
5009280	5017760	Well, the platonic solids do come up in particle physics, because that is the only possible shapes
5017760	5024000	for the wave function of electrons in their orbits, for the wave function to kind of wrap
5024000	5030480	around nucleus of an atom in three dimensions, the only possible shapes that can equate to the
5030480	5037120	peaks of the wave functions have to be the vertices of platonic solids. And so like this method of,
5037120	5043520	you know, assuming real ontological status to these higher things allows you to build a rational
5043520	5048640	system with explanatory power. It has like, it worked for live nets, it worked for people who
5048640	5056080	have done serious work. And this, the alternative, a totally flux based bottom up irrationalism,
5056080	5062640	whatever, can't do that. Nobody's ever done, nobody's ever built the complete system without it.
5062640	5066800	And you can reject it on pragmatic grounds alone by saying, okay, well, what are you going to build
5066800	5072160	with it, man? Like, you have to build a complete theory in order to compete in this world, not to
5072160	5077680	bring it all down to the pragmatic justification. But what's that? Did I answer your question or?
5079200	5086480	Yeah, so, so my understanding of the forms is that, you know, in Platonism and Aristotelianism,
5087200	5092320	the certain point is that being is intelligible. And so there's, there's no,
5093280	5100640	you know, there's no like ultimate duality between subject and object and, you know,
5101920	5109280	knowledge in the world. So the forms basically are the intelligible aspect of reality. And so
5109280	5119280	they're more real than sensible objects. So sensible objects aren't a lesser copy of an invisible world.
5120080	5125680	But it's basically like degrees of reality, going from absolutely nothing
5127280	5133920	to pure ideas, which is, yeah. Yeah, am I am I getting that right so far?
5133920	5139120	Yeah, I think probably a part of it is the language that the Greeks used for these different concepts,
5139120	5144800	like all elements of the spectrum have reality. There's I mean, reality is kind of like a binary
5144800	5150640	thing. It's either real or not. So degrees of reality doesn't make a lot of sense. But degrees
5151200	5157520	of essence does make sense, right? And essence is the word Usia in Greek that is often translated as
5157520	5163280	being misleadingly in English. And so this leads people to thinking that there's only one, you
5163280	5169200	know, real being. And this is all just fake, like the world's fake, then that's not what it means.
5169200	5174800	It's that the realities here are contingent on higher realities, they don't have self-subsisting
5174800	5182640	essences, which is the definition of a new sea, right? So yeah, in essence is one example of this
5182640	5190880	kind of metaphysical framework that the Platonists generated that can be helpful in thinking about
5190880	5196240	these things, just like Aristotle's category categories are helpful for thinking about metaphysics.
5196240	5200160	And also if people think that, you know, you don't have to replay them, you can't like evaluate,
5200800	5205920	you can't, or rather you can evaluate this stuff based on a couple of people talking about it.
5205920	5211040	It's ridiculous. Do your dang homework and go and like learn the foundations of Western philosophy,
5211040	5213840	because you can't cram it in there and then like think you're going to understand it.
5213840	5220320	But this system was built out of metaphysical distinctions. So you have energy or energy
5220400	5226240	equated to activity, which is dependent on essence. So that's one kind of metaphysical
5226240	5231360	relationship of contingency there. And essence is associated with particular energies.
5231360	5238000	And then the energies of that being, you could break down into the different powers of
5238560	5246000	capacity and actual behavior. And then above the essence of a thing, there is its hypothesis,
5246000	5252320	the summit of its essence, which is the kind of existence, qua existence of that thing.
5252320	5259200	And these words have meaning, these Greek terms actually do make sense in terms of like just
5259200	5265120	the way that Aristotle's categories make sense of things. So it helps you make sense and it allows
5265120	5269360	you to build up this comprehensive system. So you, I mean, it kind of makes sense that if you're
5269360	5274080	going to be a Platonist, you have to take these terms seriously and really investigate what they
5274080	5280640	truly mean. So the idea of an essence or an Ussia is tied to the idea of a definition, right?
5280640	5285920	So that's why in in Platonism, you'll often hear the idea of something beyond being, right? The
5285920	5291840	Henads, the gods or the one itself is beyond being. What does that mean? Well, they're beyond essence.
5291840	5296880	So it's misleadingly translated into English as being, but it really means Ussia or essence,
5296880	5303440	which has to do with like defining features of that thing. And it's not only defining features,
5303440	5310400	but a set of defining features that is self-consistent and kind of self-grounding in a way, similar to
5310400	5317040	the idea of an integrated information theory in, well, IIT, which is a modern theory of mind.
5317040	5321120	I think it's basically the leading theory of consciousness out there. It's the one I subscribe
5321120	5330160	to. And you can basically equivocate between an IIT and an Ussia. So it's a particular kind of
5330160	5336880	structure that has ontological self subsistence. That's what a soul is. That's what forms have.
5338240	5343280	And then beneath the level of soul, material things aren't IITs. They're not integrated
5343280	5348000	information systems. They're incomplete and they're ontologically contingent on more fundamental
5348000	5354960	realities. Those more fundamental realities being souls and then intellects slash forms and the one
5354960	5362960	itself above it all. Yeah. So in this book, I'm reading Think and Beans. So he says that
5364080	5369040	he thinks forms has kind of been badly translated. And he says that the ways used
5370480	5379760	in the original Greek is very similar to a word like appearance. And that basically he's getting
5380400	5388080	the forms there. He says that this word is used a lot in Aristotle and Plato, like the
5388080	5399440	wattness of sensible things. So sensible objects are appearances. But it's like the reflection
5399440	5406320	of Socrates. In a sense, you would say that is Socrates. But it's like a lesser reality
5407280	5413280	than Socrates himself. And so as you move up levels of reality, you could go from like
5414640	5422000	inorganic objects to creatures that have a consciousness, that have
5423760	5431280	a level of intellect. And then you could go to humans that can think more abstractly. And so
5431920	5439840	the hierarchy that presents itself in being is going to more intelligible forms of being.
5441520	5445200	Basically, his argument is that the whole of classical philosophy,
5446800	5453040	the basis for metaphysics at a certain point is to be intelligible and that there's no
5454240	5459280	distinction between mind and reality. And so you don't get something like idealism or
5459280	5467440	materialism. Because being is just that which appears in awareness, it appears in thoughts.
5467440	5475280	So it's always an intelligible reality. It's always rational. And thinking is always thinking
5475280	5482160	of being. He actually thinks that phenomenology lines up quite well with classical philosophy
5482160	5489920	actually. But what I find interesting about it is, he basically says that this is what you
5489920	5495680	need to understand as the whole basis for classical philosophy, Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Aquinas,
5496400	5500000	that the whole basis for it is this idea that to be is to be intelligible,
5501680	5505840	that there's no distinction between subject and object. So basically, he would place the beginning
5506480	5513760	of modern nihilism at the rejection of this idea. And he says that it's one or the other. Either
5514480	5521280	being is intelligible and to be is to be intelligible, or else you can't do metaphysics
5521280	5526640	and you just have to be a skeptic and ultimately a nihilist. So he says the basis for nihilism
5527280	5531760	is rejecting that certain point of to be is to be intelligible. So that's a very,
5532720	5536320	you know, that's something I guess discussed a lot as well is like, what's the, you know,
5536320	5539600	where did it all go wrong in the West kind of thing, these kinds of discussions of like,
5539600	5545120	well, when did nihilism sit in, you know, was it Christianity? Was it Plato himself?
5545120	5552240	Was it scientific revolution? And you kind of to very different perspectives when it comes
5552240	5556880	to Platonism, because so in the case of Eric Pearl, who obviously respects Plato, he'd say that
5557600	5563440	and that losing that starting point of the harmony between thinking and being
5564320	5568800	that that gives you nihilism, because then you've no basis for any metaphysics or any objective
5568800	5575840	claims. And the post liberal theologians who get discussed in these circles sometimes would say
5575840	5582240	that, you know, with dynamicalism crisis, where we lost the sense of, we lost the belief in
5582240	5588560	universals that once we abandoned that, that God became this kind of arbitrary thing, you know,
5588560	5593840	you didn't really need God, because a lot of the justifications of classical metaphysics disappeared.
5594960	5599600	And the idea that there was an objective good, you know, the good just became like completely
5599600	5605600	contingent on God's will. But then it's like, when when you adopt that worldview, you kind of,
5606400	5611040	you're kind of already adopting, you know, 90% of what is like a modern sort of
5611680	5616880	relative worldview, but you just still have this entity of God, who has kind of an arbitrary
5616880	5623200	will. And it's like, at a certain point, you know, you've no need of that extra hypothesis.
5623200	5628560	So the post liberal sort of strand of thought that's quite popular now, especially
5629680	5635200	among some of the Catholic intellectuals, is that, you know, nominalism, which is the same thing,
5635280	5640800	kind of a rejection of Platonism, that that's the root of modern nihilism, and of the modern world.
5641520	5646880	And then that's, that's completely contrasted with like, these sort of, oh, sorry, I'm getting
5646880	5652960	a scout call right now. That's completely contrasted with like the Heideggerian view,
5652960	5658240	which is basically that everything went wrong with Plato. And Plato was the beginning of modern
5658240	5664960	nihilism. And it was precisely because of this attempt to kind of subdue reality and subject
5664960	5669760	reality to thought and to reason. And as soon as we started doing that, it kind of, you know,
5669760	5676080	it was the beginning of this kind of technical way of viewing reality where we try and, you know,
5676080	5681440	we try and abstract it, we try and bend it to our will. And that we, you know, we should be
5681440	5686800	approached in being more as a mystery, more as a poet than a philosopher. So you have two like
5686800	5696240	diametrically opposed views that the problem is that we are presupposing this unity between
5697520	5704400	intelligibility and reality versus, if you don't have that, the only option is nihilism.
5705200	5709840	So yeah, I'm just kind of spitball now, but I'm just curious what you think of that kind of
5711120	5715520	debate around the root of nihilism and what you think Platonism can tell us about that.
5717200	5724400	Yeah, I sighed much stronger with the post-liberal theologians and I think the beginnings of
5724400	5730240	nominalism, you know, like maybe a lot of the client of the West actually can be pinned on
5730240	5735520	Peter Abelard and the fact that he couldn't like keep it in his pants and then also his disrespect
5735520	5743680	of existing scholastic methods, you know, is kind of, and I wouldn't say that Peter Abelard
5743680	5750480	was a full-on nominalist yet, but like I think in his conduct, in his life, you can see just a
5750480	5758800	discontent, a desire to move beyond the limitations of his time and yeah, this like overwhelming
5758800	5762320	hubris. So I think a lot of it comes down to moral failures, you know, it's not so much
5762880	5768400	an intellectual current specifically, it's like there's always been this option available to
5768400	5776720	people to reject Dharma, reject the law of their society as sacred and inviolable and to try to
5776720	5783440	kind of cut their own path and use whatever sophistical justifications they can come up with
5783440	5788400	to that effect. That's the behavior of a lot of the Sophists in the dialogues. So they were,
5788400	5794080	there was already nihilism, you know, before nominalism and certainly before Plato. So you
5794080	5798320	can't blame it as a phenomenon entirely on Plato. You also can't blame the rationalism
5798320	5803680	entirely on Plato. With anything, Plato brought, I mean, Plato wasn't a rationalist. He completed a
5803680	5809920	rational system that was around in his day and harmonized with it rather than like completely
5809920	5816160	dismissing it, but then he went beyond it, beyond rationalism to kinds of mysticism,
5816160	5821680	including mystic practice that guided the spiritual development of high antiquity,
5821680	5828880	you know, for 800 years and led to the invention of mathematics, you know, building of
5828880	5834880	Roman architecture. You don't have the academy and, you know, all this stuff. You don't have
5834880	5839120	Archimedes. You don't have Roman engineering. You don't have all this beauty that we associated
5839120	5843520	with the classical world. And Plato is responsible for that. He's not responsible for
5843520	5849200	rationalism as such. And also, okay, Heidegger, like, what do you want exactly? Do you want us to
5849440	5856000	see the efficacy of mathematics, see what it can actually do, and then just say,
5856640	5861760	yeah, but it's a bad idea. Don't mess with it. That seems to be his approach to technology,
5861760	5867280	generally, but it's like the philosophy of an ostrich, like putting your head in the sand
5867280	5873280	and thinking that that'll allow you to kind of avoid the structural elements underlying
5873280	5878560	reality that these rationalistic philosophers are trying to tease out. And certainly, that kind
5878560	5888240	of rationalistic vein can lead to a feeling of alienation, but only if you hypothesize the wrong
5888240	5894640	entities in your theories, you know, like materialism, hypothesizing crude matter and putting it as an
5894640	5900320	ontological fundamental without even having a good definition of it, like that produces alienation,
5900320	5905360	not through rationalism, but from a failure of establishing a well-grounded rational system
5905360	5910080	philosophy. And I don't know a lot of Platonists who have, like, nihilistic tendencies,
5910960	5917920	and you can't pin rationalism on Plato. There was already rational philosophy going on
5917920	5924320	in the Eliatics with Pythagoreans, with the Ionians. So you can't just put it back in the
5924320	5931280	bottle either. It's like, this is a mode of human consciousness that had an advantage in its time.
5932160	5937680	You know, the Greeks didn't discover a lot of principles in astronomy, or even, I mean,
5937680	5942480	they ended up discovering a lot of principles in geometry, but as of the 6th century BC,
5942480	5948400	it was mainly the Egyptians responsible for knowledge in geometry, the Phoenicians responsible
5948400	5954960	for knowledge in astronomy, and the Greeks emulated what they knew, but then found that,
5954960	5961200	you know, there was no ground for that knowledge. The Egyptians grounded it in, you know, revelations
5961200	5966160	from Toph, right? The Phoenicians were not sure how they grounded their knowledge in astronomy or
5966160	5970480	whatnot, but, you know, it didn't work for the Greeks who didn't believe in the Phoenician gods.
5970480	5978880	The Greeks, once they received this knowledge, practical, rational demonstrations, or sorry,
5978880	5984480	rational tools, basically, from the Phoenicians and the Egyptians, they had to ground why they
5984480	5988880	worked themselves, and they came up with this deductive method, and that's the distinguishing
5988880	5995120	feature of Greek civilization. They systematized deduction, right? Aristotle gets credit for
5995120	6002480	logic, but like dialectics, logic existed prior to Aristotle, and it's what led to what gave the
6002480	6008240	Greeks their advantage, these new ways of thinking. It led to advantages in law, right? Plato was an
6008240	6013280	innovator in law, his ancestor Solon was an innovator in law, partly because through their
6013280	6020880	emphasis on deductive methods and like really analyzing justification in declarative speech,
6021600	6028240	they just, you know, they moved to a new mode of thought, and it's not fair to pin that on
6028240	6033920	Plato. Plato tried, once this new mode of thought emerged, he tried to harmonize it, he tried to
6033920	6040720	put it in its proper context and use it, and like in our position today, you may not like technology,
6040720	6045440	but if you just become, you know, a hermit in the woods, you're out of the game, you know,
6045440	6052080	you're not going to do any good for the world just because you have this antipathy to technology,
6052080	6056720	and that's mainly the way Heidegger seems to talk about it, and I haven't read Heidegger in years,
6056720	6063200	but like neither Nietzsche nor Heidegger, in my opinion, offer like a substantive argument
6063200	6068400	against anything that Plato's saying. At best, you get this kind of, but I don't like it point,
6068400	6074640	which is ridiculous, and as far as like modern nihilism, you know, Nietzsche himself is responsible
6074640	6079120	for a lot of people taking nihilistic turns, but mainly the nihilism in the modern world,
6079120	6086080	I think. Partly it's nominalism, but partly it's just the failure of Christianity in our
6086080	6092080	civilization, so we had a metaphysical foundation and it was lost, and now what goes in that hole?
6092080	6096320	That's really the sort, that's where you get nihilism. People don't have a groundwork for
6096320	6101120	morality. I think the average atheist, or just anyone who isn't a Christian, basically in our
6101120	6105840	societies, if they say they're a moral realist, they probably don't even have very good arguments
6105840	6113280	for it. You know, you need a system underlying your civilization to make sense of metaphysics,
6113280	6119120	ethics, epistemology, what grounds claims, like all of this stuff needs to be there to have the
6119120	6126400	whole moral structure operate, and like we undercut the foundation of our system, of our OS in the
6126400	6131280	West, and so of course you're going to get nihilism. Blaming on Plato is just kind of ridiculous.
6133440	6140640	Yeah, I think the high-deagorean critique could be applied to like Cartesian philosophy
6140640	6148160	and a lot of modern metaphysics, but yeah, I really don't think it applies to like classical
6148160	6152480	philosophy or medieval philosophy at all, because you know, that idea that it's like
6153440	6158800	autonomous reason trying to subdue the world. Well, I mean the, you know, most of classical
6158800	6167680	philosophy, like Platonism kind of ends up with a kind of apophatic, like ineffable source of
6167680	6176080	being, you know, neo-Platonism kind of starts and ends in mysticism. You know, philosophy was
6176080	6183600	considered the handmaiden of theology in the Middle Ages. You know, so the idea that like
6183600	6190640	it's kind of speculative reason trying to present like a perfect sort of rational system of reality,
6190640	6197280	again, I think that's like maybe a fair criticism of some modern rationalist philosophy, but I think
6197280	6203040	if you try and put that back onto Plato, I think you kind of missed America. I think you're missing
6203040	6211200	something that changed, you know, after Descartes and after the Scientific Revolution. So yeah,
6211200	6216640	I think that misses America. And that's, again, I'd recommend that book by Eric Perlis. It's very
6216640	6221440	expensive, it's drawn by a hard copy of it, but I'm sure you could find it, but you know, because
6221440	6229120	he shows how, you know, a lot of these problems that we associate with modern nihilism and with
6229120	6237040	the way that philosophy kind of lessens the world in terms of, you know, creating dualities like
6238160	6245040	the mind and the world and subject object and kind of skepticism about epistemology. A lot of this
6245600	6254400	was kind of solved by the platonic view of the world. And so yeah, the idea that metaphysics kind
6254400	6260000	of inherently desacralizes the world. I don't think that's true at all. I think Platonism is
6260000	6269520	is very much a counter to that. Maybe I'll just answer a couple of super chess just so we're not
6269520	6277840	super pushed for time at the end if I read them. Sorry, one second. Hunter Stern said thoughts on
6277840	6286960	Hennosis. Unification. Can you explain a bit what Hennosis is? Yeah, so the Hennads are the unities
6287760	6293200	in, well, I think the distinction is first made explicit in Iambicus, but Proclus makes it a
6293200	6301040	complete system. I have to explain a lot of, like, Proclus metaphysics here. I do incidentally have
6301520	6308080	a roughly four and a half hour video describing every one of the propositions in Proclus'
6308080	6314800	elements of theology. It's more condensed than reading it itself, but it's a bit tough. I'm
6314800	6319280	in the process of editing it. But anyway, that might help some people get the full picture if
6319280	6325280	they can put up with like four and a half hours of, you know, pre-scholastic Neoplatonism. But
6326240	6337600	the idea for each realm or hypostasis of being, there is the one exemplar of that realm, and then
6337600	6346720	this exemplar emanates imitations of itself. If it didn't produce the example, like the one itself,
6346720	6352160	for example, if it didn't give off likenesses, then it would be inert and it wouldn't be as
6352160	6357280	great as it could otherwise be. And for other arguments, we have to put goodness in the place
6357280	6363200	of this kind of ontological first principle. And so in each category, you have like the prime
6363200	6371120	intellect, for example. The hypostasis of intellect is also being life intellect. So the prime
6371120	6377120	intellect is technically being itself, Lucia itself, the archetype of all Lucia. A lot of
6377120	6381760	technical details in this that I probably don't need to go into. And then soul, there's like one
6381760	6388400	RK of all souls, the monad of souls, and then a declension through imitation, through likenesses,
6388400	6395520	moving into greater diversity and lesser powers. So in that first hypostasis of the one, the one
6395520	6401840	gives off Henads, which are often equated with the Greek gods. And they are super essential. They're
6401840	6408560	beyond intellectual definition. You know, this Eidos being translated from, or etymologically linked
6408560	6412960	to the idea of a look, I think is appropriate. All of this can be interpreted phenomenologically,
6412960	6419680	like Eric Pearl does. I think that is totally appropriate. But there's an element of phenomenological
6419680	6425440	reality that is definitional, well-defined, intellectual, strictly speaking, formal. And
6425440	6431680	then there's something beyond form, right? Form doesn't make sense unless form is contained
6431680	6438400	in a transcendental unity. So unity is higher than the application of form. And so we were
6438400	6443200	received through participation, our particular characteristics from the universals that we're
6443200	6450400	partaking of at that level. So soul receives from hypostasis of intellect through participation.
6451280	6457680	We receive unities, our unification of ourselves and unity with others through
6457680	6464000	genosis, which is a higher energy than the energy of the forms, strictly speaking.
6464640	6469120	Well, that's something I wanted to ask you, actually, about in terms of what's beyond the form.
6469120	6476880	So what's the status of the good in Platonism? Is that kind of outside of the forms? I mean,
6476880	6481040	that seems like one thing that there's an awful lot of debate about in terms of interpreting
6481040	6485120	Plato. It seems like there's an awful lot of different interpretations of exactly
6485840	6488720	what the good is and how it fits into his philosophy.
6488720	6494640	Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Sucipus, the direct successor to Plato in the Academy,
6495440	6500240	seems to, and there are very fragmentary remains of his work, but he seems to have rejected
6500960	6506480	the Platonic account of the one in the good being the first principle. Aristotle, when he talks about
6506480	6512480	Plato's hidden doctrines, I think, includes the good and the one in the definition of that kind
6512480	6519680	of first principle according to Plato. But I take, and when I read Plato and when I read Proclus,
6519680	6527680	I mean, it's, Proclus justifies his positions in his commentaries extensively through quotation,
6527680	6532800	and I mean, he's pretty compelling making his case that this is actually what Plato thought.
6532800	6541280	So I lean towards like the Proclus was right school of Platonic interpretation. So yeah,
6541280	6546800	the good is the same with the one. And this is informative for us because we can kind of
6546800	6554000	define the nature of goodness through the nature of unification. Anecdotally, it kind of corresponds
6554000	6559680	to what we think of as our well-being. Like someone is in a bad state mentally when they're
6559680	6563440	at odds with themselves, when they have inner conflict, when they're not unified,
6563440	6569040	cognitive dissonance is uncomfortable, whereas harmony and unification in the mind is positive,
6569040	6574640	or our bodies suffer pain when they're disconnected. You know, if you tear a ligament,
6574640	6578320	it's not a good feeling. If you're more well integrated, you allow yourself to heal,
6578960	6587120	then you become more unific and better at the same time. So all union, qua union is a good
6587120	6595120	because the good and the one are one, in my view, in the way that I see things. But yeah,
6595120	6599840	that's above the form. So you have the good and the one, and then peros and apairon,
6599840	6604640	or the principle of limit and unlimited, which are also super essential. And then you have the
6604640	6611040	head adds, the species of unity, which are equated to the Greek gods often. And then you have the
6611040	6616720	realm of being, life, intellect, the realm of forms in that second hypostasis.
6619040	6623680	Okay, what about, you know, we hear about the, you know, the tree transcendental is true beauty
6623680	6629920	goodness, but it seems like the good has a, an especially unique place and play those philosophy,
6629920	6635920	but what about beauty then? So beauty isn't just beauty isn't is the form is that something
6636800	6643520	forms as well. I believe. And so part of the system, like the general principle, once you
6643520	6647120	want to accept, there are forms, you have to kind of put them in their proper taxonomy. And
6647120	6651760	that's a lot of the work that neoplane necessary engaged with. So I can't remember where I read
6651840	6658880	it, but somebody calls beauty like actually the chief form. I don't know about that. Exactly. I
6658880	6662880	don't know precisely where to put this idea of beauty, but it's certainly in the rumble forms.
6664880	6672000	Okay, that's interesting. Because there's also, I forget that it was at the Tabungan school,
6672000	6678240	like there's there's this German school of interpretation of Plato that, you know,
6678240	6683040	to summarize really simply, I guess they, they said that there's like, there was
6684080	6688720	an unwritten doctrine of Plato that was preserved through some other people and that you can find
6688720	6693360	from from oral accounts and so on. And if you put it together, basically, it looks remarkably
6693360	6700160	similar to what we would call neoplatinism, like platinus. And if they're correct, then, you know,
6700160	6706880	if you add in like the kind of oral teachings of what how Platinism was taught and the unwritten
6706880	6713040	doctrines, then there's actually very little difference between Plato and platinus. So yeah,
6713040	6718160	well, what do you think of that interpretation in terms of what we're missing from the dialogues
6719280	6724800	that's kind of necessary to make sense of Plato's metaphysics that was likely there that we've missed?
6725920	6731680	Yeah, I basically agree with that school of thought. When I read the dialogues before I had
6731680	6738160	read neoplatinism, as I said before, I interpreted it in in terms of Advaita Vedanta, and I saw no
6738160	6745040	real conflict there. So I mean, I do see Plato as a kind of monist, you know, maybe not, you might
6745040	6752880	say he's like a qualified non-dualist, perhaps rather than like unqualified monism or monism,
6753840	6762560	whatever. So yeah, platinus, I don't agree with on everything some of his doctrines.
6764400	6769200	Proclus disagrees with, I tend to side with Proclus on those, like for example,
6769840	6774720	platinus, when looking for a principle of evil, goes to matter itself. Whereas,
6775760	6780800	you know, for Proclus, matter is the lowest entity ontologically, the most contingent,
6780800	6786480	most dependent entity, least productive itself, but it's not a principle or archaic evil. For
6786480	6793760	Proclus, there isn't an archaic evil. So platinus can lead to this more like mannequin view in some
6793760	6801760	ways. So yeah, I mean, I would see platinus more as like an unqualified non-dualist. Proclus and
6802560	6810000	Plato would be more, you know, qualified non-dualists. But I do see an essential continuity there,
6810000	6815600	for sure. And again, like people, if you want to argue that Plato wasn't a Pythagorean, it just
6815600	6819360	seems to me you can't have actually read through the dialogues. Because many of the characters
6819360	6825040	who are most respected, Parmenides, Zeno influenced by Pythagoras, maybe not technically Pythagoreans
6825040	6831200	themselves, but Timaeus in the Timaeus is Pythagorean. And then if you look at the roster of the first
6831200	6836320	students in Aristotle schools, his school was effectively a Pythagorean school. I think the
6836320	6842000	mainstream consensus among scholars is that Plato was a Pythagorean. And there was a Neo-Pythagorean
6842000	6847840	tradition that kept running all the way through until the beginning of Neoplatonism. And there's
6847840	6854080	also more continuity between Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism, I think, than many people suspect.
6854080	6858720	It's just that not as many of the writings of the Middle Platonists survive. And I don't,
6858720	6863040	I haven't gone through all of them, like I need to read Plutarch's Moralia, which isn't all about
6863040	6867360	morals. A lot of it actually has to do with, like, more Platonic cosmology and metaphysics.
6867360	6873760	So I'm curious what, you know, I respect Plutarch's sense of style, at least, from his biographies.
6873760	6880640	But yeah, he had some Platonic doctrines to relate to his own in his day. So I, yeah, I think an
6880640	6889920	unbroken line of Pythagorean slash Platonic influence is the way to interpret these philosophies,
6890000	6898000	their antiquity. Although, yeah, there were innovations in Neoplatonism. But there's so
6898000	6904800	much in the dialogues that it's often possible to kind of go back and interpret even things that
6904800	6911360	seem to be very late additions, you know, like this dichotomy between the one and the hen ads,
6911360	6917040	but within the first hypostasis, like that's a kind of proto-scholastic fine distinction that
6917040	6922640	doesn't seem to be there in Plato. But, you know, if you read carefully enough, like Proclas tends to,
6922640	6928080	maybe you can see a justification. So I would say overarching continuity with some development,
6929120	6930480	especially in late antiquity.
6932720	6937360	All right, I want to ask you as well about Plato's conception of God. So obviously,
6938080	6945040	in the Tamaeus, he puts forward this idea of a demiurge that created the world according to
6945040	6952480	mathematical principles, but it's not the kind of God of classical theism, right? He's a creator
6952480	6958160	God, you know, he has a bit more agency. It's not the kind of ultimate transcendent sort of
6958720	6968160	apophatic being that we might be used to Platonists, you know, how to describe God in theology. So is
6968160	6974800	there like two gods in Plato? Is there the demiurge and a more sort of transcendent classical
6974880	6983920	conception of God? Or, you know, is the good something that is kind of above God in that sense
6983920	6988400	as the ultimate principle? Or, you know, are we to understand that as it relates to like classical
6988400	6997120	theism? Right, if we're going to go with Proclas again, then there will be a relationship of the
6997120	7003600	one and the good to the Greek gods that equates to the relationship between the monad of like,
7003600	7011040	say, triangularity to all particular triangles. So the monad of Henads is the one itself, and that
7011040	7015760	because of that, we can call that the first God. Proclas does in the elements of theology,
7015760	7022400	call the one itself the first God. So in that way, you could say, I know, Proclas would identify as
7022400	7029040	a polytheist, but you kind of say there's a cult monotheism there. But anyway, so you have that
7029040	7035680	kind of divinity beyond participation, pure unity. Like, and things don't directly participate of the
7035680	7042320	one, they participate via intermediaries, the one remains in itself, never affected by what's
7042320	7047680	outside of it, but containing everything outside of it, always from eternity, emanating out copies
7047680	7053040	of itself. And then we participate of those unities. Now, the demiurge is at a lower level.
7053120	7059680	He's not even the summit of the second hypostasis, which is being as such, the chief among
7059680	7067040	intelligibles. And being has to be superior to intellect, because intellect aims at particular
7067040	7073840	beings. Intellect isn't like, it only makes sense if it has a target. And because something that is
7073840	7080080	aimed at a target is subordinate to its end, right, it is trying to get to its end, it can't be the
7080080	7086320	ultimate thing. So intellect is not ultimate. In that second hypostasis, being that the principle
7086320	7093600	being being itself is is preeminent. But so you have the principle being the principle of life,
7093600	7100080	and then the principle of intellect. And that that member of this, this set here would be where you
7100080	7106640	find the demiurge as such. And his peculiar feature is that he's the intelligible intellect. So
7107360	7113840	within intellect, you have a spectrum of the chief intellect, and then subordinate imperfect,
7113840	7119680	less complete intellects declining from there. In the demiurge himself, his objects of
7119680	7126560	intellection, what he's looking at with his intellect is one in the same with his essence.
7126560	7133680	So he contains all the forms in in himself, all intellects contain all forms, but in different
7133680	7139680	ratios. So like the form of, I don't know, say a triangle again, or whatever, will contain in some
7139680	7145120	sense, seminally, all the other forms, but it will emphasize the one that is its peculiar identity.
7145120	7150560	What's unique about the demiurge is that he contains all the forms unfiltered in himself.
7150560	7156080	And his act of creation is also kind of similar to the way that the one creates. He remains in
7156080	7162400	himself. And through his self contemplation, generates these likenesses that then as intermediaries
7162400	7166400	kind of do his work. So there's actually not just one demiurge. There's a whole
7167600	7174160	series of demiurgic intellects, which engage in the fabrication of the world in Platonism,
7174160	7186160	or according to Proclus at least. So yeah, it's so in some ways, like the demiurge in Proclus
7186160	7192720	looks like God in Aristotelianism, you know, for Aristotle, God is thought thinking itself,
7193360	7199680	and that is kind of what the demiurge is. It's the prime intellect as such, reverting to itself,
7199680	7204560	and intellect is an essentially revered function in each of these, just to kind of
7204560	7210320	complexify it a little bit more, in each of these hypostases, there is abiding, progressing,
7210320	7215840	and reverting necessarily. So each moan out of a series, for example, abides in itself,
7215840	7221680	progresses to its last members, and reverts to itself. So intellect in the being life,
7221680	7227920	intellect hypostasis is the revered function. Being is abiding, life proceeds, proliferates,
7227920	7235120	differentiates, and then intellect in gathers and brings back, you know, what was disseminated.
7235120	7241600	So the demiurge is that chief of the revered, revered of function in gathering everything in
7241600	7248160	the realm of forms, and then through that kind of emanates the lower realms of reality beneath
7248160	7258240	himself as his product. Yeah, the, the idea of like, positing two gods or two natures of God is
7258240	7263520	actually, you actually see it crop up again and again, like, again, Alfred North Whitehead
7264880	7268080	theorized that there was like an imminent and a primordial
7269440	7275120	nature to God, that there was a, you know, God as he acts in the world, and sort of directs,
7276480	7282560	you know, the concrescence of the world versus the God that kind of, because Whitehead kind of
7282560	7287600	was a Platonist, he's presented as like a process philosopher, but really I see this like updated
7287600	7291920	Platonism, but you know, then he had the primordial aspect of God that he needed to pause it to like
7293200	7298480	uphold the, what he called them, eternal objects, which are basically his version of
7298480	7304880	Platonic forms. But it's kind of, maybe this is, you could tell me if this is a good analogy, but
7304880	7309840	you know, in Hinduism and Vedanta, they have the idea that, you know, there's Brahman, which is
7309840	7316080	obviously the complete ineffable source of everything that, you know, apophatic
7316960	7323680	descriptions apply to, but then as it concerns the world, Vedanta actually has like a kind of a
7323680	7329520	second God, which is more like the kind of personal, theistic creator God that they call Ishvara,
7330560	7336240	and they say that, yeah, that you have to have, you know, that that's basically Brahman's interaction
7336240	7342640	with the created world, like somehow generates this like absolute mind. So would you say it's a
7342640	7349600	fair analogy that like Demiurge is like Ishvara and Vedanta, and then the Platonic idea of the one
7349600	7352800	is, you know, could be equated with like the Hindu idea of Brahman?
7355360	7363120	Yeah, unqualifiable, yes. Okay, that's interesting. And another thing is, would you say then that the,
7364080	7371120	from a Platonic conception of things, does the good have any creative power? Like,
7371120	7375760	I know that might sound like a weird question, but I've been, I've been reading this book. It's
7375760	7380880	very interesting called Universes by John Leslie. I don't know if you're familiar with it. But he
7380880	7385440	basically argues for a modern version of the defined union argument, which I do find very
7385440	7391200	convincing. You know, just take a modern physics, things like the cosmological constant. And
7392160	7396320	you know, I'm sure you're familiar with like the kind of modern updated version of it. But then
7396320	7402320	at the end, it's kind of interesting. So he's not committed to any religion. But he thinks the
7402320	7408720	fine tune in argument basically is a convincing argument for God. And it's a much better argument
7408720	7412800	to multiple universes. But then at the end, there's an interesting chapter where he's speculating,
7412800	7419920	well, okay, what, what created this? And he says that he finds the Platonic answer
7420960	7426480	the best. But the way he presents it is that the universe came into existence because it was an
7426480	7432240	ethical good that it would exist. So that's, I mean, that's kind of a, the way we're used to
7432240	7436240	thinking in Western philosophy, I think that's kind of a, that kind of hits you as a very left
7436240	7444640	of field idea that somehow something being good itself, like gives itself creative power,
7444640	7451280	like because it was good that the universe would exist. That goodness itself created the universe.
7451280	7456720	It's a very strange idea, but he says that this is like a platonic conception of the good. So
7457680	7459280	yeah, I'm just curious what you think of that.
7460000	7470480	Hmm. These arguments, like, basically pre Anselm ontological arguments are found in Neoplatonism.
7473040	7478080	I don't, I've never really liked ontological arguments. I do side with Schopenhauer on that.
7478080	7485120	So it's, it's difficult. You know, in some ways, I'm kind of like getting into Neoplatonism just
7485120	7488560	in the last two years. I read Plato, you know, many years ago, I've always considered myself
7488560	7493680	a Platonist, but I never really took the literature seriously and tell more recently. So I can't,
7493680	7499600	I can't speak like in specificity on, on precisely that point.
7500640	7508800	But I mean, does Plato suggest that the good has some, has some creative power? Like, is it just
7508800	7514160	this, you know, because when you think of the good, it's this kind of static, you know, unchanging.
7514240	7518080	But the idea that it could have like creative power to generate the universe,
7518080	7522800	Leslie calls that a Platonic idea. That's a, it's a very different way of thinking about that,
7522800	7531360	isn't it? Yeah, I mean, there is, there is talk of like the generation from the one in the good.
7531360	7538400	The question is like, how do you justify that argument? Right? One argument that Proclas makes
7538400	7542880	is similar to a kind of ontological argument where, you know, once we've identified
7543440	7549120	the first principle as the good, and his, I could go through his arguments for why,
7549120	7555600	but they're a little bit convoluted. But anyway, once you get that identity of the first principle,
7555600	7563760	then okay, what is better, something being inert and static, or something overflowing itself and
7563760	7568560	having abundant infinite powers? Well, clearly the latter, right? Appealing toward intuitions.
7568640	7573440	So I haven't really seen like an excellent argument on that point. I have my own way of
7573440	7579120	thinking about it, which has always been like the kind of ultimately permedean, more this is
7579120	7587200	where the monism really comes in or monism comes in, where the one is inconceivable unless it subsumes
7587200	7592720	the rest of reality anyway. And then the description of reality being emanated out of it is really
7592720	7600720	just a factor of like limitations and separations being temporarily imposed through perspectives
7600720	7605600	on this one, so that you're never outside of the one, the one has to contain everything.
7605600	7610320	But in another manner of speaking, we can say it has to overflow itself and create likenesses of
7610320	7617600	itself. But like a pure one, a pure simplicity is inconceivable outside of the categorical
7617600	7622960	distinctions that we use to arrive at the notion of simplicity, like the simplicity, complexity,
7622960	7629760	dichotomy is built into our minds. And so we can't think simplicity without complexity. And so you
7629760	7635360	can't put forward a hypothesis of the first principle of being that is this perfect simplicity
7635360	7641200	with nothing else involved. No matter what, you're always kind of just leaving unspoken the rest of
7641200	7648560	the categorical schema of like what exactly defines it as simplicity. Pure simplicity is completely
7648560	7654880	ineffable, completely unthinkable, and doesn't make sense logically. But if you take this step to
7654880	7664320	say that like everything is the same as simplicity at some level, a kind of holographic containment
7664880	7674160	where complete undifferentiation is always and only at the same time, like all all differentiation
7674160	7680160	smushed into one. All differentiation has to be the same as the undifferentiated in a kind of
7680160	7686000	paradoxical way. So this is obviously we're dealing with the very summit of, I would say being, but
7686000	7691600	that's not strictly speaking correct, platonic terms, the highest level of reality. And so in
7691600	7698080	mystical systems, in perennialist systems, there's always antinomy, seeming paradox, seeming contradiction
7698080	7705760	because we've run up against the limits of dynoia, rationalistic thinking. We can't touch that element
7705760	7712480	of reality through abstractions because they are inherently categorical, inherently relational.
7712480	7717920	And so you can't express simplicity through relation, through a relational medium. The only
7717920	7723360	mode of contact would have to be intuitive, which is why like the knowledge of this reality
7723360	7728880	can only ever come down to us rationalistic philosophers from those who through through
7728880	7735520	theology or yoga or whatever have made contact with that more unitive ineffable aspect of reality.
7737280	7744400	So does it make sense to say that? I mean, does it make sense to ask why the forms exist? Like
7744400	7748960	is there any level of contingency or are they just absolutely necessary? Because like take
7749840	7755200	like modern Christians, right? Like, I think William Land Craig argues that he believes in,
7755200	7763520	you know, abstract objects, that numbers exist. But he thinks that it's a itself kind of an
7763520	7769040	argument for the existence of God, but he also says that these wouldn't exist without God creating
7769040	7773920	them, without God creating the laws of logic and numbers and so on, because he says that it's like
7774800	7779440	it's a terrible limitation on God if you say that these, you know, numbers and abstract
7779440	7786240	objects and stuff are absolutely necessary. Because, you know, that's that's there themselves
7786240	7793200	kind of constraining God then. So like what's kind of a standard traditional like plateness
7793200	7797680	take on that? Like would Plato have said the, would you have ever speculated about like why
7797680	7801600	the forms exist? Or would a plateness say that that's kind of a meaningless question?
7803920	7810240	No, I don't think it'd be meaningless. I think they why they exist, you can easily justify on
7810240	7814240	epistemological grounds, like theoretically, we have to postulate these entities to make sense
7814240	7819920	of what we see. But like the bigger question of why they are there, you have to go to the higher
7819920	7827520	principles beyond the forms have to be prolific themselves, or they would be not as good as they
7827520	7832640	could otherwise be. So again, it's this kind of variety variation on the ontological argument
7832640	7838320	that people keep falling back on here, which I'm not totally happy with. But I think one way of
7838320	7846240	thinking of it is just that because creation from the one happens through similitude likenesses of
7846240	7853120	himself, the forms inevitably reflect the nature of that kind of divine reality in itself. So it's
7853120	7860160	not it's not a matter of God kind of with like libertarian free will selecting, you know, how
7860160	7866720	he's going to make the world. It's rather just the world and the forms are just an overflowing of
7866720	7873200	divine power and are an expression of his nature. And so they're not arbitrary. They are the necessary
7873200	7880720	ways that being must unfold. And that's like that raises kind of the ultimate metaphysical question
7880720	7890720	that you could ask, you know, is ultimate reality necessarily one way? And does some being or
7890720	7898960	super essential reality exert some kind of will over what the nature of that possible realm of
7898960	7905280	being would be? For me, like, if if that's what you do, then you're nominalist, and ultimately,
7905280	7909680	like, you're not going to be able to have rationalistic framework, you can always take that
7909680	7914480	step theoretically. But the worldview that comes out of that won't have the same advantages that
7914480	7920880	a worldview based on necessity has. And, you know, necessity just in Greek mythology, and in most
7920880	7927200	traditional mythological systems is placed above the gods. So the way that the forms are the way
7927200	7932080	all these subordinate levels are have to just be reflections of the nature of the divine ultimately.
7934000	7938080	All right, I'm going to get to some more to super chats. George Wright said,
7938080	7942720	when translated and played with Christianity, does the one correspond to the father and
7942720	7950400	Logos, the son? Logos, Jesus is Logos in the Christian interpretation, isn't he?
7950960	7955280	Yes. Yes. I don't know about the father as one of you.
7956160	7965600	No. I mean, if anything, the father in Judaic theology is more like the Demiurge, yes.
7966320	7974720	And Logos, I mean, the Logoi are principles within soul, like Eidos is the formal principle in the
7974720	7983120	realm of forms. Logos is, I think, peculiar to the level of soul, but I could be wrong on that.
7983120	7988880	It's kind of a technical point. Just actually seen as that came up, the Demiurge, the Old Testament.
7990400	7995200	So how influential was Platonism on Gnosticism? Did they get the idea of the Demiurge direct
7995200	8003520	from Plato? Yes, for sure. Of course, like the pessimism of the Gnostics, they did not take
8003520	8008320	from Plato. Plato was really, I think, more like Leibniz, where Leibniz thought that we have the
8008320	8014160	best of all possible worlds, very anti-Schopenhauer in that way, or not in line with Schopenhauer's
8014160	8019760	views. But yeah, the world denying isn't really there in Plato. I mean, he acknowledges that
8019760	8024640	there are better places to go, but he also acknowledges that the world is a beautiful place
8024640	8029840	and is created by it. Plotinus wrote a big screen against the Gnostics, didn't he? Yeah,
8030960	8037680	right, which I haven't read in a long time. But yes, so I do think they got that idea,
8038320	8044080	the Gnostics did. Also, it deserves mentioning it's this guy, Russell Gmerkin, has a very
8044080	8049440	interesting hypothesis about the origin actually of the Old Testament as we've received it.
8049600	8054880	Sorry, what's that name, Russell? Russell Gmerkin, G-M-I-R-K-E-N, I think.
8057360	8064080	So apparently, there isn't a shred of archaeological or textual or cultural evidence at all of the
8064080	8071280	Old Testament prior to 270 BC. And that's when the Septuagint Bible is translated. The translators
8071280	8077040	of the Septuagint Bible were Hellenized Jews living in Alexandria. They translated it in the
8077040	8082160	Library of Alexandria where there were obviously tons of Hellenistic texts, including Plato.
8082960	8090160	And Gmerkin just kind of traces all of these parallels between conventions in Greek literature,
8091360	8096720	Greek legal conventions, like the idea of a constitution is uniquely Greek. The ancient,
8096720	8101760	like the Code of Hammurabi is there as a set of laws, but Near Eastern societies didn't invent
8101760	8106720	the Constitution. And yet there are constitutional elements in the Old Testament and in Greek
8107200	8113440	law, and then also like particular prescriptions that Plato offers in the laws, especially in the
8113440	8123520	Republic. And it just looks like the people who translated the Sanhedrin Bible were actually
8123520	8129840	drawing from a set of their traditional scriptures and put it together in line with Hellenistic
8129840	8138640	philosophy and especially the advice of Plato, which if true would be hugely significant. I mean
8138640	8146320	obviously, I think Gmerkin has a couple interviews on YouTube and I've read some of his more recent,
8146320	8150880	he has two books on this, I read some of the more recent book. And it's definitely an interesting
8150880	8158640	hypothesis. Well, Nietzsche said Christianity was Platonism for the masses. So if Gmerkin is
8158640	8165920	correct, then that was doubly true. Yeah, that's interesting. And then when the Gnostics criticized
8165920	8171600	the Christians, or sorry, when the Neoplatonists criticized the Christians for being a historical,
8171600	8177600	well actually, it might be because the Jews themselves invented this fake history on the
8177600	8182080	advice of Plato, as he says in the Republic, you have to believe that your institutions are ancient,
8182080	8188080	etc. And that's what the Jews who followed Plato's advice did. And so that would be like the whole
8188720	8194720	Testament, like back to Moses and Abraham. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there would be certain
8194720	8199120	scriptures that already existed, like the Book of Job, most people think is actually ancient
8199120	8205680	from like 11th century, or sorry, 11th, you know, 11th century BC, or thereabouts,
8206400	8212480	there are precedents in Near Eastern literature from the 800s, 700s, the lament literature that
8212480	8218240	like the genre looks similar to the Book of Job. But yeah, as far as the system goes that Pentateuch
8218720	8225440	the Mosaic Law, all of this stuff, and it fits with the higher criticism, like the author that's
8225440	8232320	called like the Deuteronomist, who's the latest author who really puts together like the Deutero
8232320	8239520	canonical formalization, and that system of law that would have been under Gomerkin's hypothesis
8240400	8244880	created during this translation of the Septuagint around 270 BC.
8244880	8251920	Right, that's very interesting. Yeah, I've bookmarked his Wikipedia, so I'll definitely check
8251920	8258560	that out. Hunter Stern said thoughts on the Straussian hermeneutic of Plato.
8260800	8262160	I don't know Strauss, so.
8264160	8271920	Yeah, Strauss has this interpretation that, you know, you have to have like an esoteric
8271920	8276240	interpretation of every philosopher, because they have to write in a way that doesn't,
8277040	8280720	that Plato came to this realization with Socrates that, you know, you have to present
8281600	8286160	version of your philosophy that won't upset the social order, and then one that can be
8286960	8291040	read esoterically. But I haven't read a lot of Strauss readers, so I can't really say it that
8291040	8296320	much. I mean, I agree with that. There's definitely the esoteric divide and Platonism.
8296320	8305120	Yeah, he thinks that's like, he also thinks there's an esoteric message in Plato, like specifically
8305120	8311440	about that, you know, as discussions of Socrates and stuff, like the role of the philosopher
8312160	8319920	as it pertains to the social order and trying to translate truth in that context. But yeah,
8319920	8324640	again, I haven't read a lot of Strauss, I can't really say anything too interesting on it.
8326480	8333680	Eton Vac said, Ervol speaks a lot about Platonic metaphysics, forms, etc. Okay, this is quite a
8333680	8340000	big question. One, how do you assess Plato's political philosophy strictly? Two, how much is
8340000	8345680	Plato's political philosophy grounded in his metaphysics? And, well, I guess you can answer
8345680	8350640	those first, and then I'll ask the other one, because it's kind of unrelated. Yeah, Plato's
8350640	8353840	political philosophy, it's kind of surprising we didn't cover that at all, actually, but
8354160	8360240	right. Yeah, there's a relationship known for, yeah. Right, yeah, yeah. So the relation to
8360240	8364640	his metaphysics, that's quite an interesting angle as it concerns his philosophy.
8365840	8371680	Right, I mean, they're obviously intimately connected. I am a Platonist politically as well,
8371680	8376960	and Plato was an authoritarian. Basically, it's one big endorsement of paternalism.
8376960	8383520	There is a hierarchy of souls, some souls know better. And if you don't know as well as someone
8383520	8390400	else, like you should follow the people who know. Everyone's, this is like a proceless idea,
8390400	8398080	everything's proper perfection is to be found by following, like in the train of its whatever
8398080	8403360	leads back to its proper cause. So the world is filled with these intermediary authorities that
8403360	8409840	we always have to be appealing to, to integrate ourselves into a broader hierarchy. And I think
8409920	8415920	that's basically the way and the model and the path. And I think in the 21st century,
8415920	8420960	especially it's going to become more obvious that you can't have libertarianism culturally.
8421520	8426160	You have to have some degree of paternalism. Now, there is a harmony that you can find between
8426160	8431680	libertarianism and this more authoritarian paternalistic way, which is like, you can have
8431680	8436960	independent kind of volunteerist societies that themselves internally operate on authoritarian
8436960	8443680	lines. And that's ultimately the way that I go. But yeah, I don't really disagree with Plato at all.
8444320	8450240	The Republic is meant to be like an absolute ideal. There's a couple of things we know about the way
8450240	8455440	he thought about this ideal state. One is that it corresponds to some kind of ideal form archetype
8455440	8460480	of political society that is there to be found by anyone. So Plato wouldn't have thought of himself
8460480	8469280	as inventing this system, but rather discovering like the true, most true dharma of a society
8469280	8477520	like his own. But then there's also a chart, sorry, just bear with me one moment here.
8479760	8486320	Yeah, there. So it's an ideal, it's also in the Timaeus, we learn exactly the constitution
8486400	8492960	and structure of ancient Athens. So in the Atlantis narrative, Athens defeats the
8493920	8500400	Atlantean Empire. And part of why it's able to do that is because it had this best of all
8500400	8506800	possible models of the state handed down directly by Athena. So it's given by the gods. It's also a
8506800	8512720	form, perfect mode of government. And, you know, some of the particulars you could argue were
8513680	8518880	having to do with the technology of this time and place. But by and large, the process is,
8518880	8524800	I think, what needs to be there in political society, which is you need to get talent very early on,
8524800	8530640	standardize certain aspects of education, especially like music, gymnastics, mathematics,
8530640	8536160	like what we've basically done. Like a lot of philosophy of education over the centuries
8536880	8544240	its origin to Plato's philosophy of education, and of Athens more broadly. You know, a lot of what
8544240	8551360	Plato recommends in the Republic is just like, do what Athens does and this and this additional
8551360	8556800	stuff. So yeah, I mean, I would consider myself a Platonist, basically, and it's tied to the
8556800	8564000	metaphysics because that's what the guardians have to do. They have to be able to make contact
8564000	8568880	once they've studied their mathematics, completed the rationalistic philosophy, learned all the
8568880	8574400	mundane principles of government. Then, you know, when they're 55 and up, and they're at the real
8574400	8580800	head of the hierarchy, they can like make make that intuitive contact with the forms, you know,
8580800	8588160	come to know the perfect state directly, and then come back down into the cave into the political
8588160	8594560	society and enforce that. And unless for Plato, you have this caste, spiritually enlightened caste
8594560	8599280	that can return to the higher realm in some form and, you know, make contact with that
8600320	8605120	guiding principle or formal principle of society, then it'll break down. So they're definitely
8605120	8613040	connected. All right, and the second part of that question was just, have you encountered
8613600	8615120	tropes nominalism?
8619360	8626480	No. Okay, yeah, I'm not very familiar with either. Just one other thing on that actually,
8627360	8633440	again, it's quite a big question. But I mean, in terms of the Plato's approach to political
8633440	8638320	philosophy versus Aristotle, I mean, what would you say is, is the main difference there? Is it
8638320	8645520	that Plato is more focused on, like, the perfect ability of people through the state in a way
8645520	8651040	that Aristotle isn't, you know, he's more taken the kind of family is a starting unit, would you
8651040	8660000	say that's a fair characterization? Plato certainly has more hope for the perfect ability of man,
8660000	8665920	but people mischaracterize that and take it in this kind of communist or like new socialist man
8665920	8670320	way in thinking that like everybody's going to be transformed. And Plato knows that's not
8670320	8675760	happening. Obviously, this is for the elite. It's for a small segment of the population to
8675760	8684640	actually overcome these kind of egoistic limitations of everyday life and and make a difference.
8684640	8690400	But anyway, Aristotle, I've read his politics, but I'm trying to kind of remember like where
8691360	8698320	where he really situates like the highest form of government. I know he ranks, I mean, his ranking
8698320	8707200	is similar to that of Plato from the Republic. But do you recall like does he put aristocracy on top
8707200	8714240	still? I don't know that he really like fundamentally disagrees. All that might mean he gets the idea
8714320	8719760	like man is a social animal, you need this larger community, but that also it follows
8719760	8725440	right in line with what Plato talks about in the Republic. You know, maybe there's
8726160	8732480	more emphasis on kinship, but also Plato, like if bare minimum, people need to believe that they all
8732480	8737920	spring from the same ground, you know, they do have this blood and soil connection. So that's
8737920	8743200	important mythologically for Plato, even if not like if it doesn't always have to be ethnographically
8743280	8748880	true, for example, like the Athenian tribes were legal fictions and people more or less knew that.
8749440	8755600	And yet Plato would endorse such tribal divisions, even if they don't come from an
8755600	8762000	organic source, they can still be useful for the state. Yeah, so I don't know, I would have to
8762000	8769680	reread the politics to really make a robust comparison. All right. Hunter Stern said,
8769680	8774480	is there any difference between Dugan and Urban Crystal both have their start in politics with
8774480	8779280	their own strand of Bolshevism, then through a schizo hermeneutic of Plato and onto influence
8779280	8786800	politics? Well, they're political views are obviously quite a bit different, I would say.
8787760	8793040	Sovereign Air said, you don't need to watch a video called the Athenian Revolt Against Babylonian
8793040	8799920	Finance. I linked it, I think it's by that channel that used to be around vertical politics.
8800640	8804480	Promise you won't be disappointed with the quality. He's one of the best creators,
8804480	8810640	not as official channel. All right, well, I'll check that out. But yeah, that's all the superchats.
8812240	8816560	Yeah, did you have any other topic regarding Plato you wanted to cover?
8816960	8826960	I mean, I think basically, like the challenge for people is if you don't want to accept the theory
8826960	8833360	of forms to explain how universals work, then you have a lot of other work to do in really making
8833360	8839120	a robust nominalist system. I know that a lot of other professional philosophers are nominalists.
8839120	8845040	I just don't think anyone can be a nominalist coherently. That's my case. That's what I defend.
8845600	8850880	So a lot of it does come down to the theory of the forms, the idea of universals,
8852640	8857280	what is the first principle of being? If it's not unity, if you don't go with Plato there,
8857280	8861440	and you don't take that kind of monism, then what's your first principle? The question is like,
8861440	8867840	here's this system. It is acted as the foundation of Western philosophy for more than 2000 years.
8867840	8871760	People have built off it in thousands of different ways in different ages.
8872400	8878480	And so if you're going to just say no to it, okay, man, now it's your turn. Now it's your turn to
8878480	8883760	build this system that's going to work for us as a foundation. And I don't see anybody coming up with
8883760	8889680	anything like that. If perennialism is essentially true, there is one true philosophy, then you
8889680	8896080	should expect the majority of the traditions out there will always be guided by a similar kind
8896080	8904640	of basic set of beliefs. You see that in Hinduism, in Platonism, you see that hints of it in what we
8904640	8909600	can gather of Indo-European philosophy. There are regional differences, of course, but I think
8909600	8915120	that the basic truth, metaphysically speaking, of the world is there, and it's one. There is one
8915120	8921280	truth of the world. If you say Plato got it wrong, then what do you put in its place? And like a
8921280	8928000	reference to its flux or its ineffable or unknowable, that can remain a bare assertion,
8928000	8931440	but it doesn't amount to a comprehensive worldview. And there are plenty of scientific
8931440	8936400	Platonists who have integrated modern theories, like there are Platonists working today,
8936400	8940880	integrating quantum mechanics, integrate information to people like Johanna Rottz,
8940880	8946880	who I respect. I know that you know about these people are out there doing the work to build
8946880	8952640	the new system that, you know, the equivalent of what Aquinas did in the Middle Ages, the equivalent
8952640	8961200	of what Plato and Aristotle did in antiquity. And yeah, there's just literally no alternative.
8962640	8969120	So we've just read through the Elcibiades, and I think the basic point that is made there is,
8969120	8975440	on the one hand, the nature of the soul. Where is our identity fundamentally situated? Do we
8975440	8980400	benefit ourselves by benefiting the body? Do we benefit ourselves by acquiring power? What's that
8980400	8986560	kind of first principle? What do you do first? Like even if we agree that political power is good.
8986560	8991920	Elcibiades, of course, is Athenian statesman. Bronze Age pervert mentioned him in his book,
8993440	9001200	Bronze Age mindset, as this Athenian statesman who like had influence in Athens, and then when
9001200	9006160	they were going to arrest him at a certain point in time, defected to Sparta. And then from Sparta,
9006160	9010000	well, he impregnated the wife of the king in Sparta. And so he had to leave and he defected to
9010000	9014400	the Persians. And then from the Persians, he redefected to the Athenians who wanted him back
9014400	9019040	because they thought like, wow, based, that's cool. And so he went back and then was kicked out again,
9019040	9023920	and then eventually died in Turkey somewhere. So but he was like, you know, very guided by
9023920	9030000	Thumos, very like martial spirit kind of character. And he wanted on his like 18th birthday, as soon
9030000	9034160	as he was given full legal privileges in the state of Athens, he wanted to go into the assembly and
9034160	9039200	like tell him what was what and what they ought to be doing with the state. And the whole dialogue
9039200	9044400	is Socrates basically just saying, whoa, calm down, like, first of all, what are you advising the
9044400	9049200	Athenians on? What do you know better than them that you can inform them on? And these are the
9049200	9053040	sorts of questions that I think many people who operate in political spheres don't actually
9053120	9060560	fundamentally ask themselves, you know, what do I know better about how the state should be run?
9060560	9066000	People presume that they know better, but often they leave these fundamental notions like justice,
9066000	9071920	like advantage, like what is the soul, like these sorts of things, they leave them completely unanswered.
9071920	9076240	And this approach of like starting in the middle with philosophy and starting with common notions
9076240	9084080	and indefinable, you know, je ne sais quoi that is your identity and movement. Like, that's not
9084080	9089440	been demonstrated to work. Historically, it's this Platonist approach, what Socrates advocates for
9089440	9096960	Alcibiades like, no, first, take care of your own virtue, get grounded yourself, and learn the nature
9096960	9104320	of reality. And then maybe you'll be in a position to to advise the Athenians and, you know, exert
9104320	9111040	your influence on their on the Empire. But step one is like, Okay, prepare yourself. And I think
9111040	9117040	Plato's solution ultimately is very clear. It clearly worked. It was building a school. And I
9117040	9121760	think we we are in a similar position. We should do similar things. So yeah, I'm doing my reading
9121760	9129120	group. We just finished Alcibiades. We're moving on to the Gorgias, starting April 16. We meet on
9129200	9133520	Saturdays. People can join through the Patreon by recognizing that not everybody you can
9134560	9139840	support it doesn't work for some people situation. So I have made quite a few exceptions for people.
9139840	9144480	So basically, whoever wants to get involved, you can contact me on Skype or just join the Patreon,
9144480	9148880	and I'll send you a link and explain how it works and stuff. But it's it's kind of just required
9148880	9157120	reading. Like if you want to be more than just a commenter on current events, like if you really
9157120	9161920	take the truth seriously, you want to have this holistic worldview. And I don't think our side,
9161920	9166720	generally speaking, can win unless we have this comprehensive worldview supporting us, like you
9166720	9171920	have to at least match the kind of thing the elites have produced. And by the way, the elites got
9171920	9178800	way where they are by relying on their knowledge of Plato, they read Plato, you probably should
9178800	9182800	do like it's kind of required reading if you want to have this comprehensive worldview, if you want
9182800	9186800	to get to the bottom of things, get to the bottom of our civilization, all of this, you're going to
9186800	9191120	have to do it one way or another. So you might as well deal with others. The dialogues can be a
9191120	9196320	little bit difficult to read. There's often many layers of meaning that get lost. You know, I'm often
9196320	9202480	kind of blown away by some of the Neoplatonic commentators when they like, excuse me, explicate
9202480	9207200	a metaphor that is there in like the setting of a dialogue, for example, and I just had no,
9207840	9213600	no cognizance of it the first time reading through. So there's a lot in these texts, you know,
9213600	9218720	they not only found provided the foundation of Judaism, Christianity, some of Islam,
9220720	9225680	also Hermeticism, ancient occult traditions, Renaissance magics, like all occult traditions
9225680	9232960	from Rosicrucianism to Masonry, like Mason still talk about Pythagoras and Plato, the all of these
9232960	9237840	people who have controlled the world have built what they've built off of the back of Plato. So
9237840	9244160	even if you want to reject it, fine, first read through it. So, you know, I encourage people
9244160	9249760	with dissenting opinions also to get in contact with me. If you think I'm totally wrong, then
9249760	9254640	let's have a conversation about it, you know, take our time and really analyze what's being said,
9254640	9260720	because kind of a motive just reacting against Plato, because like Heidegger doesn't like Plato
9260720	9267360	or whatever is just kind of childish, let's grow up and get our foundation set for putting ourselves
9267360	9275200	in the best path to victory, ideally. Yeah, your Ereval's channel link is in the description,
9275200	9280880	so if you want to get in contact with them, I think you post your Skype and other links and
9280880	9285840	stuff in the video so people can find you through there. Actually, one thing, the guy who asked
9285840	9290000	about the difference between Irving Crystal and Dugan, there is actually a debate that's been
9290080	9297360	done around again lately, where Dugan actually debated Bernard Henri Levy, who has a very similar
9297360	9304880	worldview to Irving Crystal, he's like a big apologist for neoliberalism and neo-conservatism,
9304880	9308800	so you could just watch that debate if you want to see the differences in worldview.
9308800	9316400	But yeah, just one other thing actually, I mean, I know you, as far as, you know, what you mentioned
9316400	9321440	about the school and you think that we need to do something similar today in terms of bringing the
9321440	9330000	best minds together, creating like a comprehensive, coherent worldview, certain metaphysics that has
9330000	9336880	like scientific insights. If I understand you right, you think that an advantage of this is
9336880	9345600	basically, you know, who kind of wins in the social space is kind of decided by technological,
9345600	9353520	scientific advances, you know, that's kind of how liberalism came to power. Like one question I have
9353520	9358240	is like, you know, as far as that goes, I mean, if you were to bring kind of the best scientific
9358240	9365360	minds together and get a, you know, an excellent sort of theory of everything, isn't there a problem
9366240	9373360	in the modern world that like to translate that into power now requires such a massive
9374320	9380160	sort of military industrial complex behind you. Like when, you know, the more things progress,
9380160	9385440	like, you know, one time you could make a great scientific discovery with a telescope, right,
9385440	9390480	or a math equation, but now the way things are progressing, you need like the large hadron
9390480	9395760	collider for like billions of dollars, whatever that costs, and like a huge team of hundreds of
9395760	9401360	scientists. So I don't know, that's a, that was a question actually in terms of like, you know,
9401840	9409040	does having the truth, or does having a scientific insight really translate into power today if you
9409040	9416160	don't have a huge state apparatus behind you to create a huge industrial apparatus to, you know,
9416160	9420400	carry out experiments and turn that actually into technology that could make any difference.
9422240	9428240	Right. Well, on the one hand, it depends on exactly what this new
9429040	9436480	philosophy worldview scientific paradigm looks like, because if it allows us to rediscover
9436480	9442240	the lost Atlantean acoustic limitation, you know, whatever they were using, then maybe it's something
9442240	9449120	that's practical for people. That's obviously a stretch. But I think the more like direct
9450240	9456320	path to victory by having an institution like this is using it as a framework for communities
9456320	9460160	to build new kinds of production chains. So rather than trying to like build the new
9460160	9465280	high tech thing, you have to be vertically integrated and you have to start from the ground up.
9465280	9470320	So you get this society together with the right worldview, and then you organize intelligently
9470320	9476960	in paternalistic ways, and build out the production chains gradually. So the direct
9476960	9482880	application of this worldview is as an operating system for a social structure. And then you scale
9482880	9489360	that social structure by better management, by affordability, by offering like tangible material
9489360	9495120	benefits to people who joined your paradigm. And then gradually you have more communities
9495120	9500400	involved, you have more people cooperating in your system. And then the end product of that
9500400	9504880	is some of this more high tech stuff that requires, you know, more capital investment.
9505680	9509600	But I think the worldview doesn't, it's not that the direct output has to be
9509600	9515120	the side beam cannon, right? That's like, there have to be several steps before you get to that,
9515120	9522240	that end artifact. So yeah, if you have the right worldview, you can align values,
9522240	9530400	you can get people cooperating, and then simply recruit, scale, and repeat until you have the
9530400	9538400	resources you need to do whatever else you want to do. All right. Yeah, well, we're coming up to
9538400	9542960	two hours, 40 minutes. Yeah, I really enjoyed this talk. It was great to get you on. Like I said,
9542960	9549120	I'm kind of immersed myself in Platonism again. And I feel like, kind of feel like I'm starting
9549120	9553920	from scratch, because yeah, if you really get into it, you can realize that there's there's a lot of
9553920	9559200	things you kind of took for granted, or you kind of gloss over some of the ancient philosophers,
9559200	9565280	I definitely did. You know, you kind of like, well, my experience anyway, no, I found the
9566080	9570960	just you feel like you there's like a sort of obligatory, like summary reading of them that
9570960	9575600	you have to do. And you just get the basics of them. And that's kind of it. So I found looking at
9575600	9579760	like secondary literature. And like I said, I really recommend that book by Eric Pearl.
9581280	9585760	You realize that it is actually a completely different way of approaching philosophy, a completely
9585760	9590400	different way of thinking about the world. And you actually have to like set aside all your sort of
9590880	9597040	modern prejudices in how you think about the world and how you approach questions about reality.
9597040	9602880	And it's actually, you know, it has its own kind of feeling and logic to it. But then once you
9602880	9608480	imbibe that, you realize that, you know, it's such a radically different way of doing things.
9608480	9613120	And it really does solve a lot of modern problems. So yeah, I think people should take an early
9613120	9618000	look at Platonism and Ereval's channel is very good. I also shared, I know you promote them,
9618640	9623440	you interview them. I shared this channel on my Telegram. I'm forgetting the name,
9623440	9629600	is it like E.C. Winsper? Yes, that's it. E.C. Winsper. Yeah, I recommend that channel as well.
9630320	9634960	And you can find Ereval's interview with them where they have another discussion about Plato.
9635760	9640320	But yeah, thanks for joining me, Ereval. I appreciate it. Thanks for everyone that tuned
9640320	9646800	in, sent super chats. And yeah, potentially, I'll be back next week. I'm going to have
9646800	9652960	Tyler Hamilton debating Adam Green on the historicity of Jesus in two weeks from now,
9652960	9658560	which I think will be an interesting debate. And yeah, that's all for now, everyone. So take care.
9659440	9659920	Thanks, Keith.
