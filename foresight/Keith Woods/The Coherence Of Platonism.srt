00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Alright everyone, so today I want to talk about this book called Platonism and Naturalism,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,840
The Possibility of Philosophy, by the Platonist scholar Lloyd Gerson.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,680
Now this is an interesting book to cover because this actually presents a very good introduction

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:24,080
to Platonism, you know, Platonism as it's thought in sort of introductory courses and

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,280
colleges and so on.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,960
We don't really get a full perspective on Platonism, right?

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,360
We get what's sort of in the dialogues, you know, the Republic and Plato's ideal form

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,280
of government and the forms and so on.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,640
But the kind of Platonism Gerson presents is, you know, Platonism as it was a school

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
of thought.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,080
So, as well as what's in the dialogues, you know, there is a deeper sort of more esoteric

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:56,600
reading of the dialogues and of Plato that includes Plato's so-called unwritten doctrine

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,080
as it was taught to Platonists, it includes the testimony that Aristotle gave of what

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Plato believed.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,120
Plato also had a number of epistles where he further explained some of the sort of more

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,800
esoteric elements of his thought and then of course there's the whole school of Platonism

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:20,800
or what we call neo-Platonism, people like Plotinus and Proclus and that's often presented

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,600
as kind of a separate school of philosophy, right?

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
It's neo-Platonism.

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,440
Something like Gerson would say, no, this is just Platonism and what usually separates

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,360
them is, again, you know, Platonism we think of the forms, the separate forms, this world

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:41,360
of forms and we think of neo-Platonism as this more kind of religious philosophy where

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,120
the one is very central and it's this kind of mystical view of the world where everything

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,400
unfolds from the one.

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,720
Well Gerson argues that this was always central to Platonism, that central to Plato's philosophy

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,280
is what he calls the superordinate idea of the good or the one and that Plato's whole

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,520
philosophy is really built around this and a lot of scholars kind of missed this point

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,200
and they have a much more sort of exoteric reading of Plato.

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,480
Now this book is interesting because Gerson, as well as presenting the whole outline of

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,720
the Platonist philosophy and given this deeper reading of Platonism, he actually argues that

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,720
when we understand Platonism this way we begin to see that essentially philosophy is a kind

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,840
of binary choice between Platonism and naturalism and we can actually read the whole history

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,600
of Western philosophy as this conflict between Platonism and naturalism because what Gerson

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,000
argues is that this whole system of Platonism, it all fits together, the key elements of

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,680
it inform the elements and if any one of those isn't possible then philosophy itself isn't

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,080
possible because without the Platonist viewpoint philosophy basically wouldn't have anything

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,720
to tell us and we would just be limited to what science can tell us about the world.

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,080
Now to back this up Gerson starts this book with a cover in Richard Rorty who's quite

39
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,600
a well-known post-modernist philosopher and he's a good background to this because Rorty

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,120
basically argued the same thing and philosophy in the mirror of nature, he argues that Platonism

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,620
and philosophy are identical because if one rejects Platonism one has no specific knowledge

42
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:36,320
to contribute. If you reject the tenets of Platonism you really can't claim that philosophy

43
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,480
can tell us anything unique about the world. Although philosophers from Aristotle onward

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,800
made philosophical criticisms of Plato, Rorty claims that they did so from a Platonic starting

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,600
point they shared with Plato basic assumptions of principles, the questioning of which was

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,720
never the starting point of any objection and so it is possible to read all of classical

47
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,480
philosophy as this kind of dialogue within Platonism. Aristotle is a Platonist, of course

48
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,160
you have the Neoplatonist when you have Christian philosophers, scholastics like Aquinas, they

49
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,560
too are starting from these kind of Platonist starting points. Rorty maintained that the

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,480
fundamental divide between Platonists, whether this is self-declared or not, and anti-Platonists

51
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,720
is that the former believed that it's possible to represent truth in language and thought

52
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,400
whereas the latter do not. Rorty is known for this book Philosophy in the Mirror of

53
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,920
Nature and this is basically his argument, the argument of the post-modernist is that

54
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,040
our thought can't accurately represent truth and that there's a fundamental divide between

55
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,800
these and this is his rejection fundamentally of Platonism. Rorty says that Platonic thought

56
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,320
is systematic, that is it believes it has a distinct subject matter. So what binds Platonists

57
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,480
together is their belief that philosophy can discover unique knowledge and so this is the

58
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,880
central question to this book and to this whole inquiry is does philosophy have unique

59
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,600
knowledge, can philosophy tell us something about the world? And so we get to this conflict

60
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,240
of Platonism versus naturalism. Gerson agrees with Rorty that Platonism just is systematic

61
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,080
philosophy and this means that we can look at other systematic philosophers like Spinoza,

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Hegel or Leibniz and we can actually see them as constructing versions of Platonism.

63
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,640
They have many of the same assumptions, the same kinds of conclusions and when we introduce

64
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,920
this conflict of Platonism versus naturalism we can see that philosophers fall on some

65
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,320
side of this divide and some try and kind of synthesize the two positions although Gerson,

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,240
another one of his central arguments is that a synthesis isn't really possible. In the

67
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,520
end you have to make your choice between Platonism or naturalism. So he says Platonism first came

68
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,720
under attack from Christian philosophers who wanted to identify the first principle of all

69
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,840
with the God of Scripture and so the kind of theism that would have come out of early Christianity

70
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,800
would have been in conflict with the idea of divinity that's present in Platonism with the one

71
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:30,040
but he sees the second wave of attack as more significant. Of course there's a conflict here

72
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:37,640
but this is kind of remedied or synthesized by people like Thomas Aquinas and Saint Augustine.

73
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,720
Eric Perl in his book Thinking Bean which we covered on my book club this year basically

74
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,760
argues that Thomas Aquinas should be read as a Neoplatonist philosopher and that he really takes

75
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,800
his whole philosophy of divinity and its relation to the world from Platonists and he synthesizes

76
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,560
this with Scripture and with the Christian God but the second wave of attack is more significant.

77
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,920
It comes into 17th century when Platonism which had by then become wedded to Christianity came

78
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:13,320
under attack from naturalism and the history of philosophy since then has been various failed

79
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:20,760
attempts in Gerson's opinion to marry naturalism and Platonism. So of course you know the 17th

80
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:27,240
century we get the the scientific revolution the rejection of the kind of Aristotelian approach to

81
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:35,000
nature and new philosophies and new defenses of forms of naturalism and then Gerson's reading of

82
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,800
enlightenment philosophers like Hegel or like Leibniz is that they're trying to synthesize

83
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,200
naturalism and Platonism trying to come up with some kind of middle position.

84
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:54,680
And so the first part of this book Platonism and Naturalism is dealing with the important question

85
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,920
of what actually is Platonism. As mentioned earlier there is a sort of standard introductory reading

86
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:07,480
to Plato that Gerson feels misses a lot of important points so let's begin. Understanding

87
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,400
Platonism requires historical investigation. Although there are historical divisions among

88
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,800
Platonists the divisions occur under the umbrella of shared principles. Platonism is this school of

89
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:27,000
thought that has worked out over centuries and there are many influential important Platonists

90
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,840
and we have to look at the sort of dialogue between them and how that unfolds to really

91
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,120
understand Platonism. Platonism insists on the distinctness of its subject matter which is nothing

92
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,800
but the subject matter of philosophy. This subject matter is the intelligible world or what is

93
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:48,200
available to thought as opposed to sense perception. This is a very important aspect of Platonist

94
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,280
worldview is that philosophy has a distinct subject matter because it's concerned with

95
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,440
the intelligible world and this is something that's separate from mere sense perception.

96
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,400
Plato sought explanatory reductivism. He believed there were ultimate explanations for things that

97
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,400
were as simple as possible. This explanatory reductivism is ultimately satisfied by the

98
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:17,400
ultimate explanation of a superordinate first principle the idea of the good. Much modern

99
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,000
scholarship on Platonism ignores how central this is to the Platonic system so as mentioned this is

100
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,240
why the work of Gerson is really interesting is because he centers everything around the idea of

101
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,120
the good and how central it is in Plato's system. The idea of the good or the one as it was called

102
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:41,480
in later Platonism and this is in the dialogues but it's only pointed to in some brief passages

103
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,080
so people really miss the importance of this in the opinion of Gerson. Platonism must also be

104
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,560
understood as a rejection of philosophical precursors and specifically of materialism,

105
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:00,760
mechanism, nominalism, relativism and skepticism and you see each of these positions represented by

106
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,800
different precursors to Plato in the dialogues who Socrates argues with and these are the five

107
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,000
Antes as Gerson calls them so in constructing this kind of Ur-Platonism in finding out what

108
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,880
Platonism is he does this as a kind of negative inquiry where he says that it's a rejection

109
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,520
of these five Antes and from this rejection you get the positive worldview of Platonism.

110
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,520
The five Antes are firstly nominalism. Plato rejects nominalism which is the view that if

111
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:36,680
two or more things are the same then they must be identical. Nominalism there's no conceptual

112
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,640
space for sameness that is not identity. Essentially nominalism is the rejection of

113
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:50,840
universals. It's a rejection that there are things common to things like you know redness

114
00:10:50,920 --> 00:11:01,480
or you know tuness that they're common to them but not identical so again it's essentially the

115
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,600
rejection of universals. Materialism is the view that the only thing that exists are bodies that

116
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,000
is three-dimensional solids and whatever supervene's on or is epiphenomenal to these bodies so this is

117
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,560
obviously the dominant way of thinking about the world today with our sort of scientific view of

118
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:29,240
things that it's just kind of matter and motion and these three-dimensional solids sort of slam

119
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,720
together and out of that we sort of accidentally get complexity and this is how everything really

120
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,000
is explained in a sort of scientific worldview. The third principle Plato rejects is mechanism

121
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,760
which is the principle of causal closure it's the view that all causal explanations available to us

122
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:55,560
are found within a naturalistic framework. Everything is determined by naturalist principles

123
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:02,120
and there's no getting outside of this naturalist causal chain. He also rejects relativism which

124
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:09,080
is the view that there exists no normativity independent of the interests or beliefs or desires

125
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,160
of one or more human beings so we have no way to adjudicate any kind of moral judgments any kind of

126
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:23,160
objective hierarchy of values it's all just subjective preference. Finally he rejects skepticism

127
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,920
which is the view that there exists no infallible cognition and it's interesting or it's important

128
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,880
to remember that all five of these aunties basically come about as a part of the naturalist

129
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,360
worldview and in the view of Gerson if you are a naturalist you have to accept all five of these

130
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,120
positions and so Platonism in rejecting and arguing against all of these is showing the

131
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,600
untenability of naturalism. So if you're a naturalist if you believe that all there is

132
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,160
is the objects of this world you would have to be a nominalist there's no space for something

133
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,160
like the number four or the color red existing in some kind of ideal or conceptual space beyond

134
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,560
its instantiation in the world. You'd have to be a materialist because again if you're a naturalist

135
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:20,120
how can you posit some kind of ideal forms or substances beyond the things we observe in the

136
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:26,920
world as kind of implied by naturalism. You'd have to accept mechanism because again what kind of

137
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:34,120
things would play a causal role if not for things observed in the world in a naturalist

138
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:42,040
worldview you would have to be a relativist because what kind of you know what kind of thing would

139
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:48,120
an objective moral good or some kind of objective standard be that's not presented to us just by

140
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,320
what we observe by nature that's something that comes about true cognition true value judgments

141
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,640
and making that objective in a naturalist worldview is basically untenable.

142
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,760
And we also see that naturalism often leads to skepticism I guess the best example is the

143
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,400
philosophy of David Hume and you could look at someone like Rorty himself and this kind of

144
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:15,880
skeptical attitude that if naturalism is true why would we suppose that our minds can access some

145
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:23,720
kind of infallible cognition you know we are just evolved apes with brains that are evolved for

146
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,400
survival rather than for truth and it would be a very strange thing if we had access to some kind

147
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:36,680
of ideal space of objective truth. So Plato rejects all of these in his rejection of naturalism.

148
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:42,760
Now what's also necessary to understand Platonism as well as the rejection of these five principles

149
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:50,360
is Plato's explanatory reductivism. So throughout the dialogues a positive and systematic position

150
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,520
can be sketched out in opposition to these views this is that was the negative side this is the

151
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:01,160
kind of positive side of Plato. According to Gerson the central pillar of the positive construct

152
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:07,640
on the basis of this foundation is clear and unambiguous it is an unhypothetical first principle

153
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,240
of all called in the republic the idea of the good and according to Aristotle's testimony

154
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,240
identified by Plato with the one. If Platonism doesn't have this systematic unity then the

155
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,920
individual elements must fall apart. Each of Plato's arguments against his predecessors relies on the

156
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,520
coherence of the other aspects of his philosophy and each relies on the explanatory role of the

157
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:39,000
first principle of all. Gerson emphasizes this a lot that when people try to understand say Plato's

158
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,440
view of ethics or his view on the forms or his view on knowledge something like this and they

159
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,160
take this in isolation from the rest of his philosophy and even ignore something like the

160
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,360
first principle of all the idea of the good that it starts to not make sense and it all

161
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,240
becomes very kind of arbitrary so you have to understand this as a complete system there's

162
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,760
an all or nothing binary between Platonism and naturalism either every element of Platonism

163
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,360
holds up as a complete alternative or they all collapse and this is the central argument of

164
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,440
this book it's one or the other it's Platonism or naturalism. Platonism and philosophy are identical

165
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,720
if naturalism is true there is no role for philosophy.

166
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:30,360
So now since we've constructed this binary between Platonism and naturalism it's worth

167
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:37,560
looking at what actually is naturalism. So naturalism maintains that there is no realm or subject

168
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,240
matter that is unreachable by the natural sciences specifically the realm of the immaterial. Now we

169
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,760
should be well acquainted with naturalism today because it's really the dominant mode of thought

170
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,200
when it comes to questions of philosophy you can think of like something like the New Atheist

171
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,440
movement right people like Richard Dawkins are just preaching naturalism and kind of basic

172
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,720
arguments for naturalism in the naturalist worldview but there are examples in antiquity of

173
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:11,240
course there's the atomism of Democritus and Lucretius and the Stoics also attempted to synthesize

174
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,720
Platonist and naturalist principles for example they accepted mechanism and materialism but they

175
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,080
did maintain a kind of teleology in attempt to overcome relativism which we'll look at later.

176
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,960
Modern naturalists often admit elements which naturalism cannot explain for example consciousness,

177
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,800
intentionality, truths of mathematics but they either claim that these are a mystery or that they

178
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,840
will eventually be explained by natural science. This is something that's probably become a lot

179
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,760
more common in recent times is the naturalist kind of accepting the limitations of the naturalist

180
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,520
worldview but saying look this worldview works it's better than any of the alternatives and

181
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,680
we often get this extreme faith and kind of scientific progress where they don't really

182
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,960
have a good account of something like consciousness but they put their faith that well eventually

183
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,760
science will be able to explain all of these things not recognizing that sometimes there's

184
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,640
a kind of qualitative gap to be bridged in explaining these things that can't just be

185
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,600
explained by sort of quantitative additions to our knowledge through science. Gerson says quote

186
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,640
my working hypothesis is that there is no stable rapprochement between Platonism and naturalism

187
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,440
I'm certainly not alone in thinking that this is the case though I suspect that I would have

188
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,840
more support in this thought from naturalists and from Platonists. If I am right then the

189
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,560
possibility of philosophy understood as a source of knowledge independent of the natural sciences

190
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,560
depends on a defense of Platonism. Platonism entails the subordination of the sciences but

191
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,160
not their elimination naturalism entails the elimination of Platonism and so the elimination

192
00:18:51,160 --> 00:19:01,480
of philosophy. Now of course any discussion of Platonism has to include the forms and this is

193
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:08,360
how we begin our explanation of Platonism which is a Plato posits the forms as explanatory entities.

194
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,560
The theory of forms is supposed to explain identity and difference. How can numerically

195
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:21,320
different things be the same? How can we say that two things are both red or both beautiful

196
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,320
even though they're different? The relationship between sensible objects and the forms is one

197
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:34,360
of participation for Plato so Helen participates in the form of beauty and so you can have multiple

198
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,200
people participating in the form of beauty and so this is how many things can be the same.

199
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,800
Because thinking and sense perception are irreducibly different the object of thinking is

200
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,640
not a particular object of a particular sense but a form or structure of whatever it is that is

201
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,560
also available to the senses. So this is what thought does uniquely is disability to kind of

202
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:04,680
universalize things and forms are neither universal or particular. They're universal in

203
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,840
relation to the thinker of the form and particular in relation to a particular object having an

204
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,720
instance of the form. So the forms don't really exist this way it's often thought where there's

205
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,320
this like world of forms where there's a perfect chair and a perfect circle and the perfect color

206
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:28,840
red. They are both universal and particular so they are instantiated in the world but when we

207
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:36,760
think them we think them universally. The forms allow for what Gerson calls non-exclusive

208
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,440
predication allowing us to cognize things which are not uniquely possessed. So this is kind of

209
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:49,080
the same thing said a different way that if Helen is beautiful the statement is true

210
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,720
then it is both true that Helen's beauty uniquely belongs to her and her beauty does not uniquely

211
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,800
belong to her. The main argument for this is that without it re-identifying sensibles would become

212
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,880
impossible and this is the basis for Plato's rejection of Heraclitianism the philosopher

213
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:12,680
Heraclitus. Re-identifying something at another point in time requires a metaphysical identity.

214
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:19,880
If all you have is flux, if all you have is process without any kind of forms that this

215
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:27,080
flux enters into then your worldview would become completely unintelligible. Now Plato also believes

216
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:33,320
that this is necessary to explain false predicate of judgments. So saying something like Socrates

217
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,680
is sitting requires one to understand what it means to say he is standing. False predicate of

218
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,120
judgments are only intelligible owing to the intelligibility of true predicate of judgments.

219
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:51,720
So now we get to the idea of the good which as mentioned Gerson sees as absolutely central to

220
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,880
the whole Platonist system. The whole system is really built and downstream of the idea of the good

221
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,720
and this is something that is left out of many accounts of Platonism. So what ties all the

222
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,560
elements of Platonism together is a metaphysical first principle of all the idea of the good.

223
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:15,640
The good is beyond essence or wattness and can only be inferred from its effects. Anything that has

224
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:22,280
been is an effect of the good. All philosophical explanation converges on the good. We know from

225
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,880
Aristotle's testimony another fragments that Plato identified the good with the one. The good

226
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,400
is the one because it must be beyond any principles of limit and therefore unqualifiably simple.

227
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,440
And the forms are good like because they are principles of integrative unity.

228
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,240
However the forms are not ultimate explanations because none of them are qualifiably one.

229
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,320
The ultimate first principle of the one or the good is what makes Plato's philosophy hierarchical.

230
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,440
The greater unity there is the closer something is to the first principle.

231
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,840
Identifying the one with the good means unity is also an index of goodness.

232
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:06,120
Now why does Plato even posit the idea of the good? Well we don't find anywhere in the dialogues or

233
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,600
in the indirect tradition of Platonism an actual argument for depositing of this superordinate

234
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:19,800
first principle of all that's beyond existence and essence. But Gerson argues that we can discern

235
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,840
Plato's reasons for doing this based on the assumptions of his philosophy and these are that

236
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,680
first he assumed that there were explanations for things and secondly he was an explanatory

237
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,800
reductivist which is a term used earlier which is just to say that he sought first principles

238
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,720
that were foundational and simple. The sought for principle must be different to that which it explains

239
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,920
and lastly if the first principle of all is the source of everything it must also be the

240
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,360
explanation for the end or goal of everything. Quote if the good is the source of essence it

241
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:59,480
is also the fulfillment of essence. This idea is very central to Platonism that the greater

242
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:06,280
generates the lesser and then the greater is both the source and the end of the lesser and so the

243
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,480
end of everything is the good or the one and then of course this gets us this way of measuring

244
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:18,760
hierarchy where hierarchy is to move towards unity or integrative unity and the ultimate unity

245
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,280
is the one and so the one generates or emanates the world and then the world is kind of directed

246
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:30,280
back towards unity and goodness in this way. So this is central to the Platonic system and this

247
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,880
is where we move to virtue and its relation to the idea of the good because as mentioned earlier

248
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,640
accounts of Plato's ethics and other aspects of his philosophy when they're divorced from the

249
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,520
idea of the good there ends up being all sorts of contradictions and it becomes very arbitrary so

250
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,120
we have to re-examine Platonic virtue in light of the centrality of the idea of the good.

251
00:24:52,760 --> 00:25:00,360
Aristotle critiques the form of the good in Nicomachean ethics. His main argument is that the

252
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:07,000
good is not univocally predicable like other forms which is just to say that good in the context of

253
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,520
when means another thing to good in the context of how there are different forms of goodness.

254
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,840
There are a number of places in the dialogues in which Plato seems to group and differently a form

255
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,280
of the good along with other forms and yet in the Republic the idea of the good is said to be

256
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,840
beyond essence. So Proclus later Platonus his explanation for this is that Plato posits both

257
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,680
a form of the good among other forms and also this superordinate idea of the good or the one.

258
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,040
Plato argues that the idea of the good is the source of the goodness of every particular good

259
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,320
this would mean that there's no conflict between what is good for an individual and what is the

260
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,400
good just as it would be incoherent to ask if a mathematical truth which is true for me is also

261
00:25:53,400 --> 00:26:00,600
true. If that which appears to be good for oneself is really good it is because it indirectly manifests

262
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,440
or instantiates the idea of the good the principle of measure and the source of truth and beauty.

263
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:14,200
So this gives us kind of a better understanding of this idea from Socrates that no one owes willingly

264
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:21,080
that evil is just caused by ignorance and if we knew the good we would all pursue it because

265
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,720
in this Platonus scheme the good and the good for the individual are identical.

266
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:32,760
Now this is interesting goodness as integrative unity this is really central to understanding

267
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,880
ethics from a Platonus perspective but again something that's not discussed so much when

268
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,280
this topic is typically covered. So because the good is the one the good manifests an integrative

269
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:53,720
unity. Now that's a term you won't see much it's one that Gerson uses what it basically means is

270
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,080
the imposition of unity by a higher function on a lower without the elimination of the ladder.

271
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:06,200
Something is good insofar as it is an integrative unity and the one is the cause of the being of

272
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,560
the integrative unity of everything. Integrative unity is what makes anything at all intelligible

273
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:19,560
to understand anything it is necessary to see the unity of its parts. The ideal integrative

274
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,840
unity of the soul consists in cognitive identity with all that is intelligible. The integrative

275
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,720
unity of the soul is that of the parts of the soul ordered according to the rule of reason.

276
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:37,320
This is how integrative unity works the higher integrates and transcends the lower. One of the

277
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,920
things it means to say that the good is the one is that the good for a person is achievable only

278
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,760
via an integrative unity the sort of unity appropriate for a human being. Built on this

279
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,480
metaphysical foundation ethical prescriptions can be judged according to whether or not they

280
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,880
inhibit or promote integrative unity. Everyone has his or her own way of unifying their lives

281
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,560
or constructing an integrative self-narrative. One life can be judged better than another because

282
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,120
it's closer to the good itself. The absolutely simple first principle of all.

283
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,600
Music, physical training, mathematics, astronomy and dialectic are concrete ways of achieving the

284
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,560
good that is producing an ever greater integrative unity in the human being.

285
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,920
Now Eros and the good. The connection between the good as principle and the good as end is made

286
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:38,680
explicit by Plotinus in the Enneads. He says and it the good is itself an object of love and love

287
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:44,920
that is love of itself in as much as it is only beautiful by reason of itself and in itself

288
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,440
and indeed whatever is present to itself would not be so if that which is present

289
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,560
and that to which it is present were not one or identical.

290
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:01,640
So the good is identified with Eros and the good is beautiful because it is Eros. Of course the

291
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,920
Greeks use this term Eros to mean certain kind of passionate, desirous love.

292
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:14,280
Plato says that all things strive for the good and Eros for possession of the beautiful is the

293
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,880
same thing as for possession of the good. Everything desires that from which it comes.

294
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:26,200
All beings desire the good and so strive for integrative unity. Plotinus says the good is

295
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:32,920
also Eros of itself that is the good is essentially an activity of self-loving but the good as Plato

296
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:41,800
says is overflowing therefore this self-loving is essentially productive. So this is the Plotinus

297
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:50,600
idea of creation as an emanation of the good of the absolute directed as it were back towards

298
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:58,840
itself by the activity of love and what that looks like concretely being directed back towards

299
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:05,080
source back towards our ultimate end or good is unity integrative unity.

300
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,880
Now after having looked at the system of Platonism and how it presents an alternative to

301
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,800
naturalism, Gerson turns to historical Platonism and looking at how Platonism unfolded through

302
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:24,600
other Platonists that came after Plato himself and of course where else to start but with Aristotle.

303
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,680
Gerson does have a separate book called Aristotle and Other Platonists so this is something he's

304
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:38,040
argued a lot is the proper way to understand Aristotle as a Platonist. Plato's work was

305
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:46,120
still ongoing at the time of his death and Platonism as a systematic philosophy was completed by

306
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:55,160
Aristotle, Plotinus and Proclus. Aristotle shares Plato's five anti's that's the five positions

307
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,080
Plato opposed earlier on that we talked about Aristotle also poses all of those and he also

308
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,520
shares Plato's positing a metaphysical first principle of all. Scholars often point Aristotle's

309
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:13,000
rejection of the immortality of the soul as a reason for excluding him from Platonism. Gerson

310
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,120
argues that none of the fundamentals of Platonism actually require a belief about the immortality

311
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,640
of the soul. Also Aristotle believes in the immortality of the intellect which may not be

312
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:30,200
different from the immortal part of the soul that Plato identifies. Aristotle believes that

313
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,120
super sensible or immaterial being exists necessarily in which case the denial of its

314
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,680
existence entails a contradiction. If immaterial entities did not exist physics would not fill

315
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:49,080
the role of metaphysics as naturalists claim rather there could be no such thing as metaphysics

316
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:55,480
or a science of being qua being. There could only be a science which quote cuts off a part of

317
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,480
being and studies that but does not examine being universally. So Aristotle clearly has the same

318
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,000
conception of philosophy and what philosophy does in terms of studying intelligible being that

319
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,680
science can't study and he clearly has the same perspective on the unique knowledge offered by

320
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:21,000
philosophy. When we look at Aristotle's discussion on first philosophy, Aristotle implies that physics

321
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,480
is second philosophy while Plato reserves the term philosophy for what Aristotle calls first

322
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,360
philosophy, refusing to designate what naturalists do as philosophy at all. Both of them deny the

323
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:40,200
autonomy of physics. Aristotle unlike Plato thinks that there is only knowledge of what is universal

324
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:46,600
and necessary. What Plato calls philosophy, Aristotle calls first philosophy and both identify

325
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:52,200
its subject matter with the intelligible, nonsensible world. Here is a quote from Gerson on the topic.

326
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,760
Since the sign of being qua being is the science of the properties of being

327
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,560
and these can only be understood when they are understood as derived from the primary

328
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,560
referent of being namely the unmoved mover. All metaphysics is saturated with the immaterial.

329
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:13,160
It is the explanation for the necessity and universality of science and the dependence

330
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,200
of physics on the primary referent of being that makes it practically impossible to recruit

331
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,920
Aristotle to the ranks of naturalists. Aristotle also contributes the idea of potency to the

332
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,440
Platonic project holding that it is not possible to understand any process in nature without

333
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:37,160
understanding the potency which is its terminus. But potency is not sensible and can have no

334
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:43,800
role to play in a naturalist account of nature. So we see a lot of reasons why this approach

335
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:50,120
that is sometimes taken of presenting Aristotle as a philosopher that is friendly to naturalism

336
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,000
runs into a lot of problems. And this idea of potency was taken up by later Platonists.

337
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:02,360
Plotinus draws on it quite heavily. Now another thing that Aristotle argues for

338
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,560
that is very Platonist but he actually argues for this more explicitly than Plato is the

339
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:13,400
immateriality of the intellect. So Aristotle more than Plato makes arguments for why the

340
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:20,840
intellect must be immaterial. Since we can think of form universally, if intellect was not immaterial

341
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,080
then our thinking of form would just be another particularized version of it.

342
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,560
Aristotle argues that thinking universally for example of mathematics defies naturalist

343
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,320
reduction. Particularized forms are sufficient to serve as guides for survival for plants and

344
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:45,960
animals. So you know the argument is if the naturalist perspective was true why can we think of

345
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:53,000
something like abstract truths of mathematics. This argument is certainly still relevant today

346
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,200
when we have accepted Darwinian evolution as the means by which our minds evolved because

347
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,480
again the same kind of argument could be made that if that is the case why would our minds,

348
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:12,120
why would our brains be attuned to anything but survival value? Why would we be able to cognize

349
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:19,000
truth or cognize form universally? The universality of thinking requires self-reflexivity.

350
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,520
If this were not the case then thinking would just be one part of the brain monitoring another

351
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,160
but this would only be a new brain state and universality would not be achieved.

352
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,360
Presence of form and the awareness of the presence must be in the same subject and this

353
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:40,200
can only happen if the subject is immaterial and capable of bending back upon itself. Something

354
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,960
that material entities with parts cannot do. This is basically an argument that you know the mind

355
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,800
must be something other than the brain. When we think, when we cognize, it's not just individual

356
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:59,400
parts of the brain experiencing other parts of the brain but there is a self-reflexivity there

357
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,000
in the words of Gersen. Now of course another concept that Aristotle is very closely associated

358
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,120
with is his idea of the on-move mover which was quite influential on the development of

359
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:18,840
theism and theistic philosophy. Aristotle agrees with Plato on the subject matter of

360
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,720
first philosophy as mentioned which is the intelligible world and that a plurality of

361
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:29,320
principles should be reduced to a unity. Aristotle has the same kind of explanatory

362
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,360
reductivism as Plato but their disagreement comes in identifying the nature of the first

363
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:40,280
principle. Aristotle explicitly rejects as the first principle the superordinate idea of the good

364
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:45,720
along with the rest of the forms, the demiurge, and also to claim that the one and the unlimited

365
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,080
are the principles out of which the forms are made. However the on-move mover can arguably be

366
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,120
held to fulfill the functions of the above. Aristotle agrees with Plato that the first

367
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:02,200
principle is both the source and goal of creation. From the perspective of later plateness the problem

368
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:08,200
with Aristotle's version of that system sprang from his identification of the first principle

369
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,320
of all with intellect but they saw Aristotle as someone whose insights could be mine to support

370
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:20,360
a systematic platonic framework. So Aristotle does posit the on-move mover as an eternal intellect

371
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,440
and this is certainly different from Plato's conception of the superordinate idea of the good,

372
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:32,920
the one, and later plateness are obviously much closer to Plato on this but we can see that he

373
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:40,280
posits this eternal on-move mover, this eternal intellect to really solve the same kinds of

374
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:47,080
problems that Plato was trying to solve. It's the same kind of explanatory system. So you can see

375
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:53,480
what Rorty meant earlier when he said that even people that disagreed with Plato did so on kind

376
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:02,280
of plateness grounds. Now of course we have to look at Plotinus who probably more than anyone put

377
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:10,120
together a Platonism as a complete coherent system. Plotinus regarded himself and his philosophy as

378
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,640
introducing no novelty into Platonism. Instead of discarding Aristotle he integrates many of his

379
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:22,360
insights into a platonic system. The three basic principles of Plotinus philosophy are the triad

380
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:29,720
of one the intellect and the soul which he claims are present in Plato's dialogues. Gerson sees

381
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,400
Plotinus drawing out the implications of a necessary first being as his greatest contribution to the

382
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:41,640
Platonic project. Plotinus claims that the first principle must be above being and not as Aristotle

383
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:49,080
claims identical with it. Plotinus argues that being is not unqualifiably one but is a one many.

384
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,960
Being cannot be absolutely simple because being means being an existent of some sort.

385
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:00,760
Instead the oneness of being is just the unity of multiplicity. This only makes sense because

386
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,080
there is a first principle which transcends being and is unqualifiably one.

387
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,400
One thing that Gerson focuses on is Plotinus argument against the Stoics because he thinks

388
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,080
this is very relevant to his broader discussion of Platonism and naturalism and his belief that they

389
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,160
are incompatible. So Plotinus criticism of the Stoics presents an interest and insight into the

390
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,360
opposition between Platonism and naturalism because the Stoics are one of the best examples of trying

391
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:36,440
to deny their incompatibility. Stoics were naturalists that had some elements of Platonism.

392
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,400
They believed in materialism, mechanism and nominalism but like the Platonists rejected

393
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,560
skepticism and relativism. Plotinus agrees with the Stoics that the rational life is the best life

394
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,400
but Stoics cannot explain why rationally participating in the cosmos is superior to

395
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,840
participating in the way non-rational creatures do. Plotinus believes a satisfactory answer

396
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:05,080
requires the idea of the good to great achievements. If Stoics accepted this and added relativism to

397
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,760
their worldview then reason would just be an instrumental servant of the passions. Stoics

398
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:17,880
can't maintain both materialism and universal normativity. So really although Plotinus is

399
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,640
sympathetic to the Stoics because they have this kind of platonic insight of privileging

400
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:31,160
reason and the life of reason and a more kind of ascetic approach to things it's really hard

401
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:40,440
to base this in a materialist worldview. Again why you know if nature is what's to be worshipped,

402
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,440
celebrated and if you have this mechanistic materialist worldview why would reason be

403
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,680
superior to any other form of life? So although the Stoic approach to things is coming from

404
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:59,480
positive intuition and many of the prescriptions they would make on the ethical life are very

405
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,240
similar to Platonism they can't ultimately ground this without some absolute, without something

406
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:13,480
that is superordinate in order to grade ways of living and to explain why reason and the

407
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:20,680
rational life is superior to irrational life. Why would the sage be in any way superior in

408
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:26,520
the way he lives to non-human life that behaves irrationally? So the Stoics don't really have

409
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:32,280
a good explanation here. Now another very influential later Platonist is Proclus.

410
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:40,200
Proclus is probably best known as most important contribution to Platonism is he kind of comes

411
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,520
up with a full theology of Platonism that he feels could be married to Greek polytheism.

412
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,840
Now Proclus is dealing with the problem left by Plotinus which is how does this

413
00:41:53,640 --> 00:42:01,800
absolutely beyond being version of the one and how does this generate multiplicity? How

414
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,160
does this generate the world without really being directly related to it without being itself

415
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,560
determined in any way? The central problem left by Plotinus was how multiplicity could

416
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,720
proceed from the one while it remains without multiplicity. The answer of Proclus is to posit

417
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:28,600
intermediary henads or unities and these really are the gods. So Proclus argues that these energies,

418
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:37,000
these henads are greater unities than the forms and so they can explain how the one can generate

419
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,600
multiplicity much better than the system of Plotinus. As participated unities the henads bridge the

420
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:48,120
gap between the one and multiplicity. They're more unified than each form but less unified than the

421
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:53,960
one and as mentioned this allows Proclus to unify Platonist metaphysics and the traditional gods

422
00:42:53,960 --> 00:43:00,600
of Greek religion. Now it's still not really clear if this solves the problem Proclus was

423
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:06,520
dealing with. There's still the issue of how the one generates multiplicity even if there are these

424
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,040
greater unities in between. It seems you could get some kind of infinite regress where there'd be

425
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,320
more unified things all the way up. There'd be something more unified than the henads between

426
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:24,440
the henads and the one and dealing with these really fundamental questions about the one and its

427
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:32,600
relation to existence is what came to occupy later Platonists and specifically Damascus who

428
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,840
was the last head of Plato's Academy. He raises problems with the very intelligibility of the

429
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:46,040
idea of the one. The first principle of all must be absolutely simple but if it is absolutely simple

430
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:52,440
it is impossible for it to be causally connected to anything. Damascus makes these arguments in his

431
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:58,280
work Problems and Solutions Concerning First Principles where he really draws out all of the

432
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,200
implications and kind of dialectical contradictions that happen whenever we try and intellectually

433
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:10,840
conceive of the absolute and its relation to ourselves. Another argument he makes is that if

434
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:16,200
the first principle of all is disconnected from all things then the universe would not be the

435
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:22,200
totality of all things but if the first principle is part of the totality of things it is not a

436
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:29,000
first principle. But also we can't say that the totality of things is its own explanation

437
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,600
because unless there is a distinction between what is explicable and what is not then there's no such

438
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:41,320
thing as an explanation at all. Here Gerson says we're left with a profound apuria. There must

439
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:46,440
be an ultimate explanation for everything but such an explanation can neither be disconnected from

440
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,800
everything nor a part of everything and Damascus takes away even the possibility of negative

441
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:57,720
predications to the one. All discourse or intellectual grasping concerning the one is

442
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:04,200
subject to dialectical contradiction. Damascus thus emphasizes the importance of not attempting to

443
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:11,240
grasp the ineffable by means of any language so although Damascus does certainly believe in the

444
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,240
necessity of positing the one of positeness absolute first principle of ultimate reality

445
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:27,000
he really resembles a lot of buddhist and later mystical thinkers in emphasizing that reason

446
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,640
thought and language is just really limited in what we can say negatively or positively about

447
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,920
the nature of this and so he actually advises a kind of learned ignorance again a kind of mystical

448
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,680
sentiment that he advises his followers not to try too hard to intellectually grasp this but to

449
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:53,080
kind of live in the mystery and to understand a true intuition and through a kind of live knowing

450
00:45:53,080 --> 00:46:00,040
that he believes is accessible to everyone. Again Platonism is bound up with a kind of mysticism

451
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:07,000
and with an experiential aspect to its philosophy and this seems to be really emphasized in Damascus

452
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:14,520
but as demonstrated by Damascus, Platonist successors came to appreciate perhaps a resolvable

453
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:20,440
tension between the absolute simplicity of the one and its explanatory adequacy for the many

454
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,840
and Gerson concludes that quote the alternative to naturalism of any sort and along with that

455
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:32,520
the possibility of philosophy depends on the resolution of this tension. So Gerson rejects

456
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:40,120
naturalism he presents Platonism as really the only alternative to rejecting the tenets of naturalism

457
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:47,560
and at the close of the book he does say that these difficulties presented by Damascus and this

458
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:54,040
sort of fundamental difficulty in Platonism is the one potential crack in the system or it's the

459
00:46:54,040 --> 00:47:00,360
one thing that needs to be resolved that needs to be dealt with is how this absolutely simple

460
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:06,200
first principle relates to creation relates to the multiplicity and Gerson kind of leaves that as

461
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,640
an open question at the end of this book but that is Platonism and naturalism by Gerson.

462
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:18,600
I hope this was helpful as an introduction to Platonism as mentioned a lot of the introductions

463
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:25,160
and discussions around Platonism don't really deal with this deeper sort of Platonic framework

464
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:31,240
that emerged and that was common to Platonists it doesn't deal with things like the centrality of

465
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:37,160
the idea of the good the one to Platonism and so I thought this book and a presentation on it is

466
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:42,520
a good way to put the whole of Platonism as a system into perspective and also to present this

467
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:48,120
conflict that I do believe exists between Platonism and naturalism and it's an interesting angle it's

468
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:54,680
an interesting way to read for the history of Western philosophy as basically a conflict between

469
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,760
Platonism and naturalism and then you can read philosophers since the Enlightenment you can

470
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:08,760
read them as trying to synthesize it in some way so for example you just take the example of the

471
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:15,400
five anti's that were outlined so someone like Schopenhauer would reject materialism he rejects

472
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:23,080
skepticism as well but he does maintain mechanism or determinism so you can see you can read various

473
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:29,960
philosophers in this way and see their systems as attempt to marry Platonism and naturalism by

474
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:37,400
bringing together some of these anti's a rejection of them with an affirmation of others

475
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,960
and I think this is actually quite insightful I think this is quite an interesting way of

476
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:51,880
viewing philosophy because as Rorty says without this sort of fundamental union between thought

477
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:59,800
and being and the potential of our intellect to commune with being and with the intelligible

478
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:05,400
world in a very fundamental way that we can trust then the whole possibility of philosophy

479
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,080
becomes difficult to maintain and it seems like one would have to commit themselves to

480
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:18,200
skepticism and to a naturalist materialist view of the world so going back to these

481
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,000
arguments and looking at how they unfolded and really boiling it down to the fundamental

482
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,920
conflicts that exist here I think is is quite helpful but that's all for now I hope you enjoyed
