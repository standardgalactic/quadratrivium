00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
Alright everyone, so today I want to talk about this book called Platonism and Naturalism,

00:06.400 --> 00:10.840
The Possibility of Philosophy, by the Platonist scholar Lloyd Gerson.

00:10.840 --> 00:16.680
Now this is an interesting book to cover because this actually presents a very good introduction

00:16.680 --> 00:24.080
to Platonism, you know, Platonism as it's thought in sort of introductory courses and

00:24.080 --> 00:27.280
colleges and so on.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.960
We don't really get a full perspective on Platonism, right?

00:29.960 --> 00:35.360
We get what's sort of in the dialogues, you know, the Republic and Plato's ideal form

00:35.360 --> 00:38.280
of government and the forms and so on.

00:38.280 --> 00:43.640
But the kind of Platonism Gerson presents is, you know, Platonism as it was a school

00:43.640 --> 00:44.640
of thought.

00:44.640 --> 00:49.080
So, as well as what's in the dialogues, you know, there is a deeper sort of more esoteric

00:49.080 --> 00:56.600
reading of the dialogues and of Plato that includes Plato's so-called unwritten doctrine

00:56.680 --> 01:02.080
as it was taught to Platonists, it includes the testimony that Aristotle gave of what

01:02.080 --> 01:04.080
Plato believed.

01:04.080 --> 01:09.120
Plato also had a number of epistles where he further explained some of the sort of more

01:09.120 --> 01:13.800
esoteric elements of his thought and then of course there's the whole school of Platonism

01:13.800 --> 01:20.800
or what we call neo-Platonism, people like Plotinus and Proclus and that's often presented

01:20.800 --> 01:23.600
as kind of a separate school of philosophy, right?

01:23.600 --> 01:24.600
It's neo-Platonism.

01:25.080 --> 01:29.440
Something like Gerson would say, no, this is just Platonism and what usually separates

01:29.440 --> 01:34.360
them is, again, you know, Platonism we think of the forms, the separate forms, this world

01:34.360 --> 01:41.360
of forms and we think of neo-Platonism as this more kind of religious philosophy where

01:41.360 --> 01:47.120
the one is very central and it's this kind of mystical view of the world where everything

01:47.120 --> 01:49.400
unfolds from the one.

01:49.480 --> 01:55.720
Well Gerson argues that this was always central to Platonism, that central to Plato's philosophy

01:55.720 --> 02:01.280
is what he calls the superordinate idea of the good or the one and that Plato's whole

02:01.280 --> 02:06.520
philosophy is really built around this and a lot of scholars kind of missed this point

02:06.520 --> 02:10.200
and they have a much more sort of exoteric reading of Plato.

02:10.200 --> 02:16.480
Now this book is interesting because Gerson, as well as presenting the whole outline of

02:16.520 --> 02:22.720
the Platonist philosophy and given this deeper reading of Platonism, he actually argues that

02:22.720 --> 02:29.720
when we understand Platonism this way we begin to see that essentially philosophy is a kind

02:29.840 --> 02:36.840
of binary choice between Platonism and naturalism and we can actually read the whole history

02:37.920 --> 02:43.600
of Western philosophy as this conflict between Platonism and naturalism because what Gerson

02:43.600 --> 02:50.000
argues is that this whole system of Platonism, it all fits together, the key elements of

02:50.000 --> 02:55.680
it inform the elements and if any one of those isn't possible then philosophy itself isn't

02:55.680 --> 03:01.080
possible because without the Platonist viewpoint philosophy basically wouldn't have anything

03:01.080 --> 03:06.720
to tell us and we would just be limited to what science can tell us about the world.

03:06.720 --> 03:13.080
Now to back this up Gerson starts this book with a cover in Richard Rorty who's quite

03:13.080 --> 03:18.600
a well-known post-modernist philosopher and he's a good background to this because Rorty

03:18.600 --> 03:24.120
basically argued the same thing and philosophy in the mirror of nature, he argues that Platonism

03:24.120 --> 03:30.620
and philosophy are identical because if one rejects Platonism one has no specific knowledge

03:30.620 --> 03:36.320
to contribute. If you reject the tenets of Platonism you really can't claim that philosophy

03:36.320 --> 03:41.480
can tell us anything unique about the world. Although philosophers from Aristotle onward

03:41.480 --> 03:47.800
made philosophical criticisms of Plato, Rorty claims that they did so from a Platonic starting

03:47.800 --> 03:53.600
point they shared with Plato basic assumptions of principles, the questioning of which was

03:53.600 --> 03:58.720
never the starting point of any objection and so it is possible to read all of classical

03:58.720 --> 04:04.480
philosophy as this kind of dialogue within Platonism. Aristotle is a Platonist, of course

04:04.480 --> 04:09.160
you have the Neoplatonist when you have Christian philosophers, scholastics like Aquinas, they

04:09.200 --> 04:14.560
too are starting from these kind of Platonist starting points. Rorty maintained that the

04:14.560 --> 04:20.480
fundamental divide between Platonists, whether this is self-declared or not, and anti-Platonists

04:20.480 --> 04:25.720
is that the former believed that it's possible to represent truth in language and thought

04:25.720 --> 04:30.400
whereas the latter do not. Rorty is known for this book Philosophy in the Mirror of

04:30.400 --> 04:36.920
Nature and this is basically his argument, the argument of the post-modernist is that

04:37.040 --> 04:44.040
our thought can't accurately represent truth and that there's a fundamental divide between

04:45.120 --> 04:50.800
these and this is his rejection fundamentally of Platonism. Rorty says that Platonic thought

04:50.800 --> 04:57.320
is systematic, that is it believes it has a distinct subject matter. So what binds Platonists

04:57.320 --> 05:03.480
together is their belief that philosophy can discover unique knowledge and so this is the

05:03.520 --> 05:09.880
central question to this book and to this whole inquiry is does philosophy have unique

05:09.880 --> 05:14.600
knowledge, can philosophy tell us something about the world? And so we get to this conflict

05:14.600 --> 05:21.240
of Platonism versus naturalism. Gerson agrees with Rorty that Platonism just is systematic

05:21.240 --> 05:27.080
philosophy and this means that we can look at other systematic philosophers like Spinoza,

05:27.160 --> 05:34.160
Hegel or Leibniz and we can actually see them as constructing versions of Platonism.

05:34.680 --> 05:39.640
They have many of the same assumptions, the same kinds of conclusions and when we introduce

05:39.640 --> 05:44.920
this conflict of Platonism versus naturalism we can see that philosophers fall on some

05:44.920 --> 05:50.320
side of this divide and some try and kind of synthesize the two positions although Gerson,

05:50.320 --> 05:55.240
another one of his central arguments is that a synthesis isn't really possible. In the

05:55.240 --> 06:02.520
end you have to make your choice between Platonism or naturalism. So he says Platonism first came

06:02.520 --> 06:07.720
under attack from Christian philosophers who wanted to identify the first principle of all

06:07.720 --> 06:14.840
with the God of Scripture and so the kind of theism that would have come out of early Christianity

06:14.840 --> 06:21.800
would have been in conflict with the idea of divinity that's present in Platonism with the one

06:22.760 --> 06:30.040
but he sees the second wave of attack as more significant. Of course there's a conflict here

06:30.040 --> 06:37.640
but this is kind of remedied or synthesized by people like Thomas Aquinas and Saint Augustine.

06:38.520 --> 06:43.720
Eric Perl in his book Thinking Bean which we covered on my book club this year basically

06:43.720 --> 06:48.760
argues that Thomas Aquinas should be read as a Neoplatonist philosopher and that he really takes

06:48.840 --> 06:55.800
his whole philosophy of divinity and its relation to the world from Platonists and he synthesizes

06:55.800 --> 07:01.560
this with Scripture and with the Christian God but the second wave of attack is more significant.

07:01.560 --> 07:06.920
It comes into 17th century when Platonism which had by then become wedded to Christianity came

07:06.920 --> 07:13.320
under attack from naturalism and the history of philosophy since then has been various failed

07:13.320 --> 07:20.760
attempts in Gerson's opinion to marry naturalism and Platonism. So of course you know the 17th

07:20.760 --> 07:27.240
century we get the the scientific revolution the rejection of the kind of Aristotelian approach to

07:27.240 --> 07:35.000
nature and new philosophies and new defenses of forms of naturalism and then Gerson's reading of

07:35.960 --> 07:41.800
enlightenment philosophers like Hegel or like Leibniz is that they're trying to synthesize

07:42.760 --> 07:46.200
naturalism and Platonism trying to come up with some kind of middle position.

07:48.040 --> 07:54.680
And so the first part of this book Platonism and Naturalism is dealing with the important question

07:54.680 --> 08:00.920
of what actually is Platonism. As mentioned earlier there is a sort of standard introductory reading

08:00.920 --> 08:07.480
to Plato that Gerson feels misses a lot of important points so let's begin. Understanding

08:07.480 --> 08:13.400
Platonism requires historical investigation. Although there are historical divisions among

08:13.400 --> 08:19.800
Platonists the divisions occur under the umbrella of shared principles. Platonism is this school of

08:19.800 --> 08:27.000
thought that has worked out over centuries and there are many influential important Platonists

08:27.000 --> 08:30.840
and we have to look at the sort of dialogue between them and how that unfolds to really

08:30.840 --> 08:36.120
understand Platonism. Platonism insists on the distinctness of its subject matter which is nothing

08:36.120 --> 08:41.800
but the subject matter of philosophy. This subject matter is the intelligible world or what is

08:41.800 --> 08:48.200
available to thought as opposed to sense perception. This is a very important aspect of Platonist

08:48.200 --> 08:54.280
worldview is that philosophy has a distinct subject matter because it's concerned with

08:54.280 --> 08:58.440
the intelligible world and this is something that's separate from mere sense perception.

08:59.080 --> 09:05.400
Plato sought explanatory reductivism. He believed there were ultimate explanations for things that

09:05.400 --> 09:11.400
were as simple as possible. This explanatory reductivism is ultimately satisfied by the

09:11.400 --> 09:17.400
ultimate explanation of a superordinate first principle the idea of the good. Much modern

09:17.400 --> 09:23.000
scholarship on Platonism ignores how central this is to the Platonic system so as mentioned this is

09:23.000 --> 09:29.240
why the work of Gerson is really interesting is because he centers everything around the idea of

09:29.240 --> 09:34.120
the good and how central it is in Plato's system. The idea of the good or the one as it was called

09:34.120 --> 09:41.480
in later Platonism and this is in the dialogues but it's only pointed to in some brief passages

09:41.480 --> 09:47.080
so people really miss the importance of this in the opinion of Gerson. Platonism must also be

09:47.080 --> 09:53.560
understood as a rejection of philosophical precursors and specifically of materialism,

09:53.560 --> 10:00.760
mechanism, nominalism, relativism and skepticism and you see each of these positions represented by

10:01.480 --> 10:07.800
different precursors to Plato in the dialogues who Socrates argues with and these are the five

10:07.800 --> 10:15.000
Antes as Gerson calls them so in constructing this kind of Ur-Platonism in finding out what

10:15.000 --> 10:19.880
Platonism is he does this as a kind of negative inquiry where he says that it's a rejection

10:19.880 --> 10:24.520
of these five Antes and from this rejection you get the positive worldview of Platonism.

10:25.080 --> 10:30.520
The five Antes are firstly nominalism. Plato rejects nominalism which is the view that if

10:30.520 --> 10:36.680
two or more things are the same then they must be identical. Nominalism there's no conceptual

10:36.680 --> 10:43.640
space for sameness that is not identity. Essentially nominalism is the rejection of

10:43.640 --> 10:50.840
universals. It's a rejection that there are things common to things like you know redness

10:50.920 --> 11:01.480
or you know tuness that they're common to them but not identical so again it's essentially the

11:01.480 --> 11:08.600
rejection of universals. Materialism is the view that the only thing that exists are bodies that

11:08.600 --> 11:15.000
is three-dimensional solids and whatever supervene's on or is epiphenomenal to these bodies so this is

11:15.000 --> 11:21.560
obviously the dominant way of thinking about the world today with our sort of scientific view of

11:21.560 --> 11:29.240
things that it's just kind of matter and motion and these three-dimensional solids sort of slam

11:29.240 --> 11:35.720
together and out of that we sort of accidentally get complexity and this is how everything really

11:36.440 --> 11:43.000
is explained in a sort of scientific worldview. The third principle Plato rejects is mechanism

11:43.080 --> 11:48.760
which is the principle of causal closure it's the view that all causal explanations available to us

11:48.760 --> 11:55.560
are found within a naturalistic framework. Everything is determined by naturalist principles

11:55.560 --> 12:02.120
and there's no getting outside of this naturalist causal chain. He also rejects relativism which

12:02.120 --> 12:09.080
is the view that there exists no normativity independent of the interests or beliefs or desires

12:09.080 --> 12:15.160
of one or more human beings so we have no way to adjudicate any kind of moral judgments any kind of

12:15.880 --> 12:23.160
objective hierarchy of values it's all just subjective preference. Finally he rejects skepticism

12:23.160 --> 12:28.920
which is the view that there exists no infallible cognition and it's interesting or it's important

12:28.920 --> 12:35.880
to remember that all five of these aunties basically come about as a part of the naturalist

12:35.880 --> 12:42.360
worldview and in the view of Gerson if you are a naturalist you have to accept all five of these

12:42.360 --> 12:48.120
positions and so Platonism in rejecting and arguing against all of these is showing the

12:48.120 --> 12:54.600
untenability of naturalism. So if you're a naturalist if you believe that all there is

12:54.600 --> 13:01.160
is the objects of this world you would have to be a nominalist there's no space for something

13:01.160 --> 13:07.160
like the number four or the color red existing in some kind of ideal or conceptual space beyond

13:07.160 --> 13:13.560
its instantiation in the world. You'd have to be a materialist because again if you're a naturalist

13:13.560 --> 13:20.120
how can you posit some kind of ideal forms or substances beyond the things we observe in the

13:20.120 --> 13:26.920
world as kind of implied by naturalism. You'd have to accept mechanism because again what kind of

13:26.920 --> 13:34.120
things would play a causal role if not for things observed in the world in a naturalist

13:34.120 --> 13:42.040
worldview you would have to be a relativist because what kind of you know what kind of thing would

13:42.040 --> 13:48.120
an objective moral good or some kind of objective standard be that's not presented to us just by

13:48.120 --> 13:53.320
what we observe by nature that's something that comes about true cognition true value judgments

13:53.400 --> 13:57.640
and making that objective in a naturalist worldview is basically untenable.

13:58.600 --> 14:04.760
And we also see that naturalism often leads to skepticism I guess the best example is the

14:04.760 --> 14:09.400
philosophy of David Hume and you could look at someone like Rorty himself and this kind of

14:09.400 --> 14:15.880
skeptical attitude that if naturalism is true why would we suppose that our minds can access some

14:15.880 --> 14:23.720
kind of infallible cognition you know we are just evolved apes with brains that are evolved for

14:23.720 --> 14:29.400
survival rather than for truth and it would be a very strange thing if we had access to some kind

14:29.400 --> 14:36.680
of ideal space of objective truth. So Plato rejects all of these in his rejection of naturalism.

14:36.680 --> 14:42.760
Now what's also necessary to understand Platonism as well as the rejection of these five principles

14:43.320 --> 14:50.360
is Plato's explanatory reductivism. So throughout the dialogues a positive and systematic position

14:50.360 --> 14:54.520
can be sketched out in opposition to these views this is that was the negative side this is the

14:54.520 --> 15:01.160
kind of positive side of Plato. According to Gerson the central pillar of the positive construct

15:01.160 --> 15:07.640
on the basis of this foundation is clear and unambiguous it is an unhypothetical first principle

15:07.640 --> 15:13.240
of all called in the republic the idea of the good and according to Aristotle's testimony

15:13.240 --> 15:19.240
identified by Plato with the one. If Platonism doesn't have this systematic unity then the

15:19.240 --> 15:24.920
individual elements must fall apart. Each of Plato's arguments against his predecessors relies on the

15:24.920 --> 15:30.520
coherence of the other aspects of his philosophy and each relies on the explanatory role of the

15:30.520 --> 15:39.000
first principle of all. Gerson emphasizes this a lot that when people try to understand say Plato's

15:39.000 --> 15:46.440
view of ethics or his view on the forms or his view on knowledge something like this and they

15:46.440 --> 15:51.160
take this in isolation from the rest of his philosophy and even ignore something like the

15:51.160 --> 15:56.360
first principle of all the idea of the good that it starts to not make sense and it all

15:56.360 --> 16:01.240
becomes very kind of arbitrary so you have to understand this as a complete system there's

16:01.240 --> 16:06.760
an all or nothing binary between Platonism and naturalism either every element of Platonism

16:06.760 --> 16:12.360
holds up as a complete alternative or they all collapse and this is the central argument of

16:12.360 --> 16:18.440
this book it's one or the other it's Platonism or naturalism. Platonism and philosophy are identical

16:18.440 --> 16:21.720
if naturalism is true there is no role for philosophy.

16:21.720 --> 16:30.360
So now since we've constructed this binary between Platonism and naturalism it's worth

16:30.360 --> 16:37.560
looking at what actually is naturalism. So naturalism maintains that there is no realm or subject

16:37.560 --> 16:43.240
matter that is unreachable by the natural sciences specifically the realm of the immaterial. Now we

16:43.240 --> 16:48.760
should be well acquainted with naturalism today because it's really the dominant mode of thought

16:48.760 --> 16:54.200
when it comes to questions of philosophy you can think of like something like the New Atheist

16:54.200 --> 16:58.440
movement right people like Richard Dawkins are just preaching naturalism and kind of basic

16:58.440 --> 17:03.720
arguments for naturalism in the naturalist worldview but there are examples in antiquity of

17:03.720 --> 17:11.240
course there's the atomism of Democritus and Lucretius and the Stoics also attempted to synthesize

17:11.240 --> 17:17.720
Platonist and naturalist principles for example they accepted mechanism and materialism but they

17:17.720 --> 17:23.080
did maintain a kind of teleology in attempt to overcome relativism which we'll look at later.

17:23.720 --> 17:29.960
Modern naturalists often admit elements which naturalism cannot explain for example consciousness,

17:29.960 --> 17:35.800
intentionality, truths of mathematics but they either claim that these are a mystery or that they

17:35.800 --> 17:40.840
will eventually be explained by natural science. This is something that's probably become a lot

17:40.840 --> 17:46.760
more common in recent times is the naturalist kind of accepting the limitations of the naturalist

17:46.760 --> 17:52.520
worldview but saying look this worldview works it's better than any of the alternatives and

17:53.240 --> 17:58.680
we often get this extreme faith and kind of scientific progress where they don't really

17:58.680 --> 18:03.960
have a good account of something like consciousness but they put their faith that well eventually

18:03.960 --> 18:08.760
science will be able to explain all of these things not recognizing that sometimes there's

18:08.760 --> 18:13.640
a kind of qualitative gap to be bridged in explaining these things that can't just be

18:13.640 --> 18:20.600
explained by sort of quantitative additions to our knowledge through science. Gerson says quote

18:20.600 --> 18:25.640
my working hypothesis is that there is no stable rapprochement between Platonism and naturalism

18:25.640 --> 18:30.440
I'm certainly not alone in thinking that this is the case though I suspect that I would have

18:30.440 --> 18:34.840
more support in this thought from naturalists and from Platonists. If I am right then the

18:34.840 --> 18:39.560
possibility of philosophy understood as a source of knowledge independent of the natural sciences

18:39.560 --> 18:45.560
depends on a defense of Platonism. Platonism entails the subordination of the sciences but

18:45.560 --> 18:51.160
not their elimination naturalism entails the elimination of Platonism and so the elimination

18:51.160 --> 19:01.480
of philosophy. Now of course any discussion of Platonism has to include the forms and this is

19:01.480 --> 19:08.360
how we begin our explanation of Platonism which is a Plato posits the forms as explanatory entities.

19:08.360 --> 19:13.560
The theory of forms is supposed to explain identity and difference. How can numerically

19:13.560 --> 19:21.320
different things be the same? How can we say that two things are both red or both beautiful

19:22.040 --> 19:27.320
even though they're different? The relationship between sensible objects and the forms is one

19:27.320 --> 19:34.360
of participation for Plato so Helen participates in the form of beauty and so you can have multiple

19:34.360 --> 19:40.200
people participating in the form of beauty and so this is how many things can be the same.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.800
Because thinking and sense perception are irreducibly different the object of thinking is

19:45.800 --> 19:51.640
not a particular object of a particular sense but a form or structure of whatever it is that is

19:51.640 --> 19:57.560
also available to the senses. So this is what thought does uniquely is disability to kind of

19:57.640 --> 20:04.680
universalize things and forms are neither universal or particular. They're universal in

20:04.680 --> 20:10.840
relation to the thinker of the form and particular in relation to a particular object having an

20:10.840 --> 20:15.720
instance of the form. So the forms don't really exist this way it's often thought where there's

20:15.720 --> 20:21.320
this like world of forms where there's a perfect chair and a perfect circle and the perfect color

20:21.320 --> 20:28.840
red. They are both universal and particular so they are instantiated in the world but when we

20:28.840 --> 20:36.760
think them we think them universally. The forms allow for what Gerson calls non-exclusive

20:36.760 --> 20:42.440
predication allowing us to cognize things which are not uniquely possessed. So this is kind of

20:42.440 --> 20:49.080
the same thing said a different way that if Helen is beautiful the statement is true

20:49.080 --> 20:53.720
then it is both true that Helen's beauty uniquely belongs to her and her beauty does not uniquely

20:53.720 --> 20:59.800
belong to her. The main argument for this is that without it re-identifying sensibles would become

20:59.800 --> 21:05.880
impossible and this is the basis for Plato's rejection of Heraclitianism the philosopher

21:05.880 --> 21:12.680
Heraclitus. Re-identifying something at another point in time requires a metaphysical identity.

21:12.680 --> 21:19.880
If all you have is flux, if all you have is process without any kind of forms that this

21:19.880 --> 21:27.080
flux enters into then your worldview would become completely unintelligible. Now Plato also believes

21:27.080 --> 21:33.320
that this is necessary to explain false predicate of judgments. So saying something like Socrates

21:33.320 --> 21:38.680
is sitting requires one to understand what it means to say he is standing. False predicate of

21:38.680 --> 21:44.120
judgments are only intelligible owing to the intelligibility of true predicate of judgments.

21:44.920 --> 21:51.720
So now we get to the idea of the good which as mentioned Gerson sees as absolutely central to

21:51.720 --> 21:57.880
the whole Platonist system. The whole system is really built and downstream of the idea of the good

21:58.440 --> 22:03.720
and this is something that is left out of many accounts of Platonism. So what ties all the

22:03.720 --> 22:09.560
elements of Platonism together is a metaphysical first principle of all the idea of the good.

22:09.560 --> 22:15.640
The good is beyond essence or wattness and can only be inferred from its effects. Anything that has

22:15.640 --> 22:22.280
been is an effect of the good. All philosophical explanation converges on the good. We know from

22:22.280 --> 22:27.880
Aristotle's testimony another fragments that Plato identified the good with the one. The good

22:27.880 --> 22:33.400
is the one because it must be beyond any principles of limit and therefore unqualifiably simple.

22:33.960 --> 22:38.440
And the forms are good like because they are principles of integrative unity.

22:38.440 --> 22:43.240
However the forms are not ultimate explanations because none of them are qualifiably one.

22:43.960 --> 22:49.320
The ultimate first principle of the one or the good is what makes Plato's philosophy hierarchical.

22:50.040 --> 22:54.440
The greater unity there is the closer something is to the first principle.

22:54.440 --> 22:58.840
Identifying the one with the good means unity is also an index of goodness.

22:59.080 --> 23:06.120
Now why does Plato even posit the idea of the good? Well we don't find anywhere in the dialogues or

23:06.120 --> 23:12.600
in the indirect tradition of Platonism an actual argument for depositing of this superordinate

23:12.600 --> 23:19.800
first principle of all that's beyond existence and essence. But Gerson argues that we can discern

23:19.800 --> 23:24.840
Plato's reasons for doing this based on the assumptions of his philosophy and these are that

23:24.840 --> 23:30.680
first he assumed that there were explanations for things and secondly he was an explanatory

23:30.680 --> 23:35.800
reductivist which is a term used earlier which is just to say that he sought first principles

23:35.800 --> 23:41.720
that were foundational and simple. The sought for principle must be different to that which it explains

23:42.440 --> 23:46.920
and lastly if the first principle of all is the source of everything it must also be the

23:46.920 --> 23:52.360
explanation for the end or goal of everything. Quote if the good is the source of essence it

23:52.360 --> 23:59.480
is also the fulfillment of essence. This idea is very central to Platonism that the greater

23:59.480 --> 24:06.280
generates the lesser and then the greater is both the source and the end of the lesser and so the

24:06.280 --> 24:11.480
end of everything is the good or the one and then of course this gets us this way of measuring

24:11.480 --> 24:18.760
hierarchy where hierarchy is to move towards unity or integrative unity and the ultimate unity

24:18.760 --> 24:24.280
is the one and so the one generates or emanates the world and then the world is kind of directed

24:24.280 --> 24:30.280
back towards unity and goodness in this way. So this is central to the Platonic system and this

24:30.280 --> 24:35.880
is where we move to virtue and its relation to the idea of the good because as mentioned earlier

24:35.880 --> 24:41.640
accounts of Plato's ethics and other aspects of his philosophy when they're divorced from the

24:41.640 --> 24:46.520
idea of the good there ends up being all sorts of contradictions and it becomes very arbitrary so

24:46.520 --> 24:52.120
we have to re-examine Platonic virtue in light of the centrality of the idea of the good.

24:52.760 --> 25:00.360
Aristotle critiques the form of the good in Nicomachean ethics. His main argument is that the

25:00.360 --> 25:07.000
good is not univocally predicable like other forms which is just to say that good in the context of

25:07.000 --> 25:12.520
when means another thing to good in the context of how there are different forms of goodness.

25:13.480 --> 25:18.840
There are a number of places in the dialogues in which Plato seems to group and differently a form

25:18.840 --> 25:24.280
of the good along with other forms and yet in the Republic the idea of the good is said to be

25:24.280 --> 25:30.840
beyond essence. So Proclus later Platonus his explanation for this is that Plato posits both

25:30.840 --> 25:36.680
a form of the good among other forms and also this superordinate idea of the good or the one.

25:37.400 --> 25:42.040
Plato argues that the idea of the good is the source of the goodness of every particular good

25:42.600 --> 25:47.320
this would mean that there's no conflict between what is good for an individual and what is the

25:47.320 --> 25:53.400
good just as it would be incoherent to ask if a mathematical truth which is true for me is also

25:53.400 --> 26:00.600
true. If that which appears to be good for oneself is really good it is because it indirectly manifests

26:00.600 --> 26:06.440
or instantiates the idea of the good the principle of measure and the source of truth and beauty.

26:07.240 --> 26:14.200
So this gives us kind of a better understanding of this idea from Socrates that no one owes willingly

26:14.840 --> 26:21.080
that evil is just caused by ignorance and if we knew the good we would all pursue it because

26:21.080 --> 26:25.720
in this Platonus scheme the good and the good for the individual are identical.

26:27.160 --> 26:32.760
Now this is interesting goodness as integrative unity this is really central to understanding

26:33.480 --> 26:39.880
ethics from a Platonus perspective but again something that's not discussed so much when

26:39.880 --> 26:46.280
this topic is typically covered. So because the good is the one the good manifests an integrative

26:46.280 --> 26:53.720
unity. Now that's a term you won't see much it's one that Gerson uses what it basically means is

26:53.720 --> 26:59.080
the imposition of unity by a higher function on a lower without the elimination of the ladder.

26:59.720 --> 27:06.200
Something is good insofar as it is an integrative unity and the one is the cause of the being of

27:06.200 --> 27:13.560
the integrative unity of everything. Integrative unity is what makes anything at all intelligible

27:13.560 --> 27:19.560
to understand anything it is necessary to see the unity of its parts. The ideal integrative

27:19.560 --> 27:24.840
unity of the soul consists in cognitive identity with all that is intelligible. The integrative

27:24.920 --> 27:29.720
unity of the soul is that of the parts of the soul ordered according to the rule of reason.

27:30.360 --> 27:37.320
This is how integrative unity works the higher integrates and transcends the lower. One of the

27:37.320 --> 27:42.920
things it means to say that the good is the one is that the good for a person is achievable only

27:42.920 --> 27:48.760
via an integrative unity the sort of unity appropriate for a human being. Built on this

27:48.760 --> 27:53.480
metaphysical foundation ethical prescriptions can be judged according to whether or not they

27:53.480 --> 27:59.880
inhibit or promote integrative unity. Everyone has his or her own way of unifying their lives

27:59.880 --> 28:05.560
or constructing an integrative self-narrative. One life can be judged better than another because

28:05.560 --> 28:10.120
it's closer to the good itself. The absolutely simple first principle of all.

28:12.280 --> 28:18.600
Music, physical training, mathematics, astronomy and dialectic are concrete ways of achieving the

28:18.600 --> 28:23.560
good that is producing an ever greater integrative unity in the human being.

28:25.080 --> 28:30.920
Now Eros and the good. The connection between the good as principle and the good as end is made

28:30.920 --> 28:38.680
explicit by Plotinus in the Enneads. He says and it the good is itself an object of love and love

28:38.680 --> 28:44.920
that is love of itself in as much as it is only beautiful by reason of itself and in itself

28:45.560 --> 28:50.440
and indeed whatever is present to itself would not be so if that which is present

28:50.440 --> 28:53.560
and that to which it is present were not one or identical.

28:55.400 --> 29:01.640
So the good is identified with Eros and the good is beautiful because it is Eros. Of course the

29:01.640 --> 29:06.920
Greeks use this term Eros to mean certain kind of passionate, desirous love.

29:09.160 --> 29:14.280
Plato says that all things strive for the good and Eros for possession of the beautiful is the

29:14.280 --> 29:19.880
same thing as for possession of the good. Everything desires that from which it comes.

29:19.880 --> 29:26.200
All beings desire the good and so strive for integrative unity. Plotinus says the good is

29:26.200 --> 29:32.920
also Eros of itself that is the good is essentially an activity of self-loving but the good as Plato

29:32.920 --> 29:41.800
says is overflowing therefore this self-loving is essentially productive. So this is the Plotinus

29:41.800 --> 29:50.600
idea of creation as an emanation of the good of the absolute directed as it were back towards

29:50.600 --> 29:58.840
itself by the activity of love and what that looks like concretely being directed back towards

29:58.840 --> 30:05.080
source back towards our ultimate end or good is unity integrative unity.

30:05.400 --> 30:11.880
Now after having looked at the system of Platonism and how it presents an alternative to

30:11.880 --> 30:17.800
naturalism, Gerson turns to historical Platonism and looking at how Platonism unfolded through

30:17.800 --> 30:24.600
other Platonists that came after Plato himself and of course where else to start but with Aristotle.

30:25.800 --> 30:30.680
Gerson does have a separate book called Aristotle and Other Platonists so this is something he's

30:31.640 --> 30:38.040
argued a lot is the proper way to understand Aristotle as a Platonist. Plato's work was

30:38.040 --> 30:46.120
still ongoing at the time of his death and Platonism as a systematic philosophy was completed by

30:46.120 --> 30:55.160
Aristotle, Plotinus and Proclus. Aristotle shares Plato's five anti's that's the five positions

30:55.240 --> 31:01.080
Plato opposed earlier on that we talked about Aristotle also poses all of those and he also

31:01.080 --> 31:06.520
shares Plato's positing a metaphysical first principle of all. Scholars often point Aristotle's

31:06.520 --> 31:13.000
rejection of the immortality of the soul as a reason for excluding him from Platonism. Gerson

31:13.000 --> 31:18.120
argues that none of the fundamentals of Platonism actually require a belief about the immortality

31:18.120 --> 31:23.640
of the soul. Also Aristotle believes in the immortality of the intellect which may not be

31:23.640 --> 31:30.200
different from the immortal part of the soul that Plato identifies. Aristotle believes that

31:30.200 --> 31:36.120
super sensible or immaterial being exists necessarily in which case the denial of its

31:36.120 --> 31:42.680
existence entails a contradiction. If immaterial entities did not exist physics would not fill

31:42.680 --> 31:49.080
the role of metaphysics as naturalists claim rather there could be no such thing as metaphysics

31:49.080 --> 31:55.480
or a science of being qua being. There could only be a science which quote cuts off a part of

31:55.480 --> 32:01.480
being and studies that but does not examine being universally. So Aristotle clearly has the same

32:01.480 --> 32:07.000
conception of philosophy and what philosophy does in terms of studying intelligible being that

32:07.000 --> 32:12.680
science can't study and he clearly has the same perspective on the unique knowledge offered by

32:12.680 --> 32:21.000
philosophy. When we look at Aristotle's discussion on first philosophy, Aristotle implies that physics

32:21.000 --> 32:27.480
is second philosophy while Plato reserves the term philosophy for what Aristotle calls first

32:27.480 --> 32:34.360
philosophy, refusing to designate what naturalists do as philosophy at all. Both of them deny the

32:34.360 --> 32:40.200
autonomy of physics. Aristotle unlike Plato thinks that there is only knowledge of what is universal

32:40.280 --> 32:46.600
and necessary. What Plato calls philosophy, Aristotle calls first philosophy and both identify

32:46.600 --> 32:52.200
its subject matter with the intelligible, nonsensible world. Here is a quote from Gerson on the topic.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.760
Since the sign of being qua being is the science of the properties of being

32:57.640 --> 33:01.560
and these can only be understood when they are understood as derived from the primary

33:01.560 --> 33:07.560
referent of being namely the unmoved mover. All metaphysics is saturated with the immaterial.

33:07.560 --> 33:13.160
It is the explanation for the necessity and universality of science and the dependence

33:13.160 --> 33:18.200
of physics on the primary referent of being that makes it practically impossible to recruit

33:18.200 --> 33:24.920
Aristotle to the ranks of naturalists. Aristotle also contributes the idea of potency to the

33:24.920 --> 33:30.440
Platonic project holding that it is not possible to understand any process in nature without

33:30.440 --> 33:37.160
understanding the potency which is its terminus. But potency is not sensible and can have no

33:37.160 --> 33:43.800
role to play in a naturalist account of nature. So we see a lot of reasons why this approach

33:43.800 --> 33:50.120
that is sometimes taken of presenting Aristotle as a philosopher that is friendly to naturalism

33:50.120 --> 33:55.000
runs into a lot of problems. And this idea of potency was taken up by later Platonists.

33:55.800 --> 34:02.360
Plotinus draws on it quite heavily. Now another thing that Aristotle argues for

34:03.320 --> 34:07.560
that is very Platonist but he actually argues for this more explicitly than Plato is the

34:07.560 --> 34:13.400
immateriality of the intellect. So Aristotle more than Plato makes arguments for why the

34:13.400 --> 34:20.840
intellect must be immaterial. Since we can think of form universally, if intellect was not immaterial

34:20.840 --> 34:25.080
then our thinking of form would just be another particularized version of it.

34:25.960 --> 34:31.560
Aristotle argues that thinking universally for example of mathematics defies naturalist

34:31.560 --> 34:37.320
reduction. Particularized forms are sufficient to serve as guides for survival for plants and

34:37.320 --> 34:45.960
animals. So you know the argument is if the naturalist perspective was true why can we think of

34:45.960 --> 34:53.000
something like abstract truths of mathematics. This argument is certainly still relevant today

34:53.000 --> 35:00.200
when we have accepted Darwinian evolution as the means by which our minds evolved because

35:00.200 --> 35:05.480
again the same kind of argument could be made that if that is the case why would our minds,

35:05.480 --> 35:12.120
why would our brains be attuned to anything but survival value? Why would we be able to cognize

35:12.120 --> 35:19.000
truth or cognize form universally? The universality of thinking requires self-reflexivity.

35:19.560 --> 35:24.520
If this were not the case then thinking would just be one part of the brain monitoring another

35:24.520 --> 35:29.160
but this would only be a new brain state and universality would not be achieved.

35:29.160 --> 35:34.360
Presence of form and the awareness of the presence must be in the same subject and this

35:34.360 --> 35:40.200
can only happen if the subject is immaterial and capable of bending back upon itself. Something

35:40.200 --> 35:45.960
that material entities with parts cannot do. This is basically an argument that you know the mind

35:45.960 --> 35:51.800
must be something other than the brain. When we think, when we cognize, it's not just individual

35:51.800 --> 35:59.400
parts of the brain experiencing other parts of the brain but there is a self-reflexivity there

35:59.400 --> 36:05.000
in the words of Gersen. Now of course another concept that Aristotle is very closely associated

36:05.000 --> 36:12.120
with is his idea of the on-move mover which was quite influential on the development of

36:12.120 --> 36:18.840
theism and theistic philosophy. Aristotle agrees with Plato on the subject matter of

36:18.840 --> 36:23.720
first philosophy as mentioned which is the intelligible world and that a plurality of

36:23.720 --> 36:29.320
principles should be reduced to a unity. Aristotle has the same kind of explanatory

36:29.320 --> 36:34.360
reductivism as Plato but their disagreement comes in identifying the nature of the first

36:34.360 --> 36:40.280
principle. Aristotle explicitly rejects as the first principle the superordinate idea of the good

36:40.360 --> 36:45.720
along with the rest of the forms, the demiurge, and also to claim that the one and the unlimited

36:45.720 --> 36:51.080
are the principles out of which the forms are made. However the on-move mover can arguably be

36:51.080 --> 36:56.120
held to fulfill the functions of the above. Aristotle agrees with Plato that the first

36:56.120 --> 37:02.200
principle is both the source and goal of creation. From the perspective of later plateness the problem

37:02.200 --> 37:08.200
with Aristotle's version of that system sprang from his identification of the first principle

37:08.200 --> 37:13.320
of all with intellect but they saw Aristotle as someone whose insights could be mine to support

37:13.320 --> 37:20.360
a systematic platonic framework. So Aristotle does posit the on-move mover as an eternal intellect

37:21.160 --> 37:26.440
and this is certainly different from Plato's conception of the superordinate idea of the good,

37:26.440 --> 37:32.920
the one, and later plateness are obviously much closer to Plato on this but we can see that he

37:32.920 --> 37:40.280
posits this eternal on-move mover, this eternal intellect to really solve the same kinds of

37:40.280 --> 37:47.080
problems that Plato was trying to solve. It's the same kind of explanatory system. So you can see

37:47.080 --> 37:53.480
what Rorty meant earlier when he said that even people that disagreed with Plato did so on kind

37:53.480 --> 38:02.280
of plateness grounds. Now of course we have to look at Plotinus who probably more than anyone put

38:02.280 --> 38:10.120
together a Platonism as a complete coherent system. Plotinus regarded himself and his philosophy as

38:10.120 --> 38:15.640
introducing no novelty into Platonism. Instead of discarding Aristotle he integrates many of his

38:15.640 --> 38:22.360
insights into a platonic system. The three basic principles of Plotinus philosophy are the triad

38:22.360 --> 38:29.720
of one the intellect and the soul which he claims are present in Plato's dialogues. Gerson sees

38:29.720 --> 38:35.400
Plotinus drawing out the implications of a necessary first being as his greatest contribution to the

38:35.400 --> 38:41.640
Platonic project. Plotinus claims that the first principle must be above being and not as Aristotle

38:41.640 --> 38:49.080
claims identical with it. Plotinus argues that being is not unqualifiably one but is a one many.

38:49.080 --> 38:53.960
Being cannot be absolutely simple because being means being an existent of some sort.

38:54.680 --> 39:00.760
Instead the oneness of being is just the unity of multiplicity. This only makes sense because

39:00.760 --> 39:05.080
there is a first principle which transcends being and is unqualifiably one.

39:08.040 --> 39:13.400
One thing that Gerson focuses on is Plotinus argument against the Stoics because he thinks

39:13.400 --> 39:19.080
this is very relevant to his broader discussion of Platonism and naturalism and his belief that they

39:19.640 --> 39:25.160
are incompatible. So Plotinus criticism of the Stoics presents an interest and insight into the

39:25.160 --> 39:30.360
opposition between Platonism and naturalism because the Stoics are one of the best examples of trying

39:30.360 --> 39:36.440
to deny their incompatibility. Stoics were naturalists that had some elements of Platonism.

39:36.440 --> 39:41.400
They believed in materialism, mechanism and nominalism but like the Platonists rejected

39:41.400 --> 39:47.560
skepticism and relativism. Plotinus agrees with the Stoics that the rational life is the best life

39:47.640 --> 39:53.400
but Stoics cannot explain why rationally participating in the cosmos is superior to

39:53.400 --> 39:58.840
participating in the way non-rational creatures do. Plotinus believes a satisfactory answer

39:58.840 --> 40:05.080
requires the idea of the good to great achievements. If Stoics accepted this and added relativism to

40:05.080 --> 40:10.760
their worldview then reason would just be an instrumental servant of the passions. Stoics

40:10.760 --> 40:17.880
can't maintain both materialism and universal normativity. So really although Plotinus is

40:17.880 --> 40:23.640
sympathetic to the Stoics because they have this kind of platonic insight of privileging

40:23.640 --> 40:31.160
reason and the life of reason and a more kind of ascetic approach to things it's really hard

40:31.160 --> 40:40.440
to base this in a materialist worldview. Again why you know if nature is what's to be worshipped,

40:40.440 --> 40:46.440
celebrated and if you have this mechanistic materialist worldview why would reason be

40:46.440 --> 40:52.680
superior to any other form of life? So although the Stoic approach to things is coming from

40:53.640 --> 40:59.480
positive intuition and many of the prescriptions they would make on the ethical life are very

40:59.480 --> 41:05.240
similar to Platonism they can't ultimately ground this without some absolute, without something

41:06.120 --> 41:13.480
that is superordinate in order to grade ways of living and to explain why reason and the

41:13.480 --> 41:20.680
rational life is superior to irrational life. Why would the sage be in any way superior in

41:20.680 --> 41:26.520
the way he lives to non-human life that behaves irrationally? So the Stoics don't really have

41:26.600 --> 41:32.280
a good explanation here. Now another very influential later Platonist is Proclus.

41:33.080 --> 41:40.200
Proclus is probably best known as most important contribution to Platonism is he kind of comes

41:40.200 --> 41:46.520
up with a full theology of Platonism that he feels could be married to Greek polytheism.

41:47.240 --> 41:52.840
Now Proclus is dealing with the problem left by Plotinus which is how does this

41:53.640 --> 42:01.800
absolutely beyond being version of the one and how does this generate multiplicity? How

42:01.800 --> 42:07.160
does this generate the world without really being directly related to it without being itself

42:07.800 --> 42:13.560
determined in any way? The central problem left by Plotinus was how multiplicity could

42:13.560 --> 42:19.720
proceed from the one while it remains without multiplicity. The answer of Proclus is to posit

42:19.800 --> 42:28.600
intermediary henads or unities and these really are the gods. So Proclus argues that these energies,

42:28.600 --> 42:37.000
these henads are greater unities than the forms and so they can explain how the one can generate

42:37.000 --> 42:42.600
multiplicity much better than the system of Plotinus. As participated unities the henads bridge the

42:42.600 --> 42:48.120
gap between the one and multiplicity. They're more unified than each form but less unified than the

42:48.120 --> 42:53.960
one and as mentioned this allows Proclus to unify Platonist metaphysics and the traditional gods

42:53.960 --> 43:00.600
of Greek religion. Now it's still not really clear if this solves the problem Proclus was

43:00.600 --> 43:06.520
dealing with. There's still the issue of how the one generates multiplicity even if there are these

43:06.520 --> 43:12.040
greater unities in between. It seems you could get some kind of infinite regress where there'd be

43:13.000 --> 43:17.320
more unified things all the way up. There'd be something more unified than the henads between

43:17.320 --> 43:24.440
the henads and the one and dealing with these really fundamental questions about the one and its

43:24.440 --> 43:32.600
relation to existence is what came to occupy later Platonists and specifically Damascus who

43:32.600 --> 43:38.840
was the last head of Plato's Academy. He raises problems with the very intelligibility of the

43:38.840 --> 43:46.040
idea of the one. The first principle of all must be absolutely simple but if it is absolutely simple

43:46.040 --> 43:52.440
it is impossible for it to be causally connected to anything. Damascus makes these arguments in his

43:52.440 --> 43:58.280
work Problems and Solutions Concerning First Principles where he really draws out all of the

43:58.280 --> 44:04.200
implications and kind of dialectical contradictions that happen whenever we try and intellectually

44:04.200 --> 44:10.840
conceive of the absolute and its relation to ourselves. Another argument he makes is that if

44:10.840 --> 44:16.200
the first principle of all is disconnected from all things then the universe would not be the

44:16.200 --> 44:22.200
totality of all things but if the first principle is part of the totality of things it is not a

44:22.200 --> 44:29.000
first principle. But also we can't say that the totality of things is its own explanation

44:29.000 --> 44:34.600
because unless there is a distinction between what is explicable and what is not then there's no such

44:34.600 --> 44:41.320
thing as an explanation at all. Here Gerson says we're left with a profound apuria. There must

44:41.320 --> 44:46.440
be an ultimate explanation for everything but such an explanation can neither be disconnected from

44:46.440 --> 44:51.800
everything nor a part of everything and Damascus takes away even the possibility of negative

44:51.800 --> 44:57.720
predications to the one. All discourse or intellectual grasping concerning the one is

44:57.720 --> 45:04.200
subject to dialectical contradiction. Damascus thus emphasizes the importance of not attempting to

45:04.200 --> 45:11.240
grasp the ineffable by means of any language so although Damascus does certainly believe in the

45:11.240 --> 45:17.240
necessity of positing the one of positeness absolute first principle of ultimate reality

45:18.040 --> 45:27.000
he really resembles a lot of buddhist and later mystical thinkers in emphasizing that reason

45:27.000 --> 45:33.640
thought and language is just really limited in what we can say negatively or positively about

45:33.640 --> 45:40.920
the nature of this and so he actually advises a kind of learned ignorance again a kind of mystical

45:40.920 --> 45:46.680
sentiment that he advises his followers not to try too hard to intellectually grasp this but to

45:46.680 --> 45:53.080
kind of live in the mystery and to understand a true intuition and through a kind of live knowing

45:53.080 --> 46:00.040
that he believes is accessible to everyone. Again Platonism is bound up with a kind of mysticism

46:00.040 --> 46:07.000
and with an experiential aspect to its philosophy and this seems to be really emphasized in Damascus

46:08.360 --> 46:14.520
but as demonstrated by Damascus, Platonist successors came to appreciate perhaps a resolvable

46:14.520 --> 46:20.440
tension between the absolute simplicity of the one and its explanatory adequacy for the many

46:21.320 --> 46:26.840
and Gerson concludes that quote the alternative to naturalism of any sort and along with that

46:26.840 --> 46:32.520
the possibility of philosophy depends on the resolution of this tension. So Gerson rejects

46:32.520 --> 46:40.120
naturalism he presents Platonism as really the only alternative to rejecting the tenets of naturalism

46:40.920 --> 46:47.560
and at the close of the book he does say that these difficulties presented by Damascus and this

46:47.560 --> 46:54.040
sort of fundamental difficulty in Platonism is the one potential crack in the system or it's the

46:54.040 --> 47:00.360
one thing that needs to be resolved that needs to be dealt with is how this absolutely simple

47:00.360 --> 47:06.200
first principle relates to creation relates to the multiplicity and Gerson kind of leaves that as

47:06.200 --> 47:11.640
an open question at the end of this book but that is Platonism and naturalism by Gerson.

47:12.920 --> 47:18.600
I hope this was helpful as an introduction to Platonism as mentioned a lot of the introductions

47:18.680 --> 47:25.160
and discussions around Platonism don't really deal with this deeper sort of Platonic framework

47:25.720 --> 47:31.240
that emerged and that was common to Platonists it doesn't deal with things like the centrality of

47:31.240 --> 47:37.160
the idea of the good the one to Platonism and so I thought this book and a presentation on it is

47:37.160 --> 47:42.520
a good way to put the whole of Platonism as a system into perspective and also to present this

47:42.520 --> 47:48.120
conflict that I do believe exists between Platonism and naturalism and it's an interesting angle it's

47:48.120 --> 47:54.680
an interesting way to read for the history of Western philosophy as basically a conflict between

47:55.480 --> 48:00.760
Platonism and naturalism and then you can read philosophers since the Enlightenment you can

48:00.760 --> 48:08.760
read them as trying to synthesize it in some way so for example you just take the example of the

48:08.760 --> 48:15.400
five anti's that were outlined so someone like Schopenhauer would reject materialism he rejects

48:15.480 --> 48:23.080
skepticism as well but he does maintain mechanism or determinism so you can see you can read various

48:23.080 --> 48:29.960
philosophers in this way and see their systems as attempt to marry Platonism and naturalism by

48:31.160 --> 48:37.400
bringing together some of these anti's a rejection of them with an affirmation of others

48:38.040 --> 48:43.960
and I think this is actually quite insightful I think this is quite an interesting way of

48:44.040 --> 48:51.880
viewing philosophy because as Rorty says without this sort of fundamental union between thought

48:51.880 --> 48:59.800
and being and the potential of our intellect to commune with being and with the intelligible

48:59.800 --> 49:05.400
world in a very fundamental way that we can trust then the whole possibility of philosophy

49:06.600 --> 49:11.080
becomes difficult to maintain and it seems like one would have to commit themselves to

49:11.880 --> 49:18.200
skepticism and to a naturalist materialist view of the world so going back to these

49:18.200 --> 49:23.000
arguments and looking at how they unfolded and really boiling it down to the fundamental

49:23.000 --> 49:28.920
conflicts that exist here I think is is quite helpful but that's all for now I hope you enjoyed
