WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.880
All right, I'm live, I'm here with Ervol, and we're going to be discussing

00:29.880 --> 00:37.400
Platonism. How are you doing, Ervol? Not too bad, yourself? Yeah, not too bad. I

00:37.400 --> 00:41.640
finally, we were meant to do this last week, actually. I didn't give people a

00:41.640 --> 00:46.120
reason why we cancelled, but I ended up getting that illness everyone has been

00:46.120 --> 00:50.440
talking about. And, you know, I heard the latest strain was meant to be quite

00:50.440 --> 00:56.840
mild, but it's definitely was one of the one of the worst viruses I've had. But

00:56.840 --> 01:02.360
yeah, doing pretty good. But yeah, as far as Platonism, I mean, some people

01:02.360 --> 01:08.280
know you as like the Plato guy, you know, you're, but you're doing a reading group

01:08.280 --> 01:12.280
on it now, which you could chill for later if people are interested in that. But

01:12.280 --> 01:16.600
yeah, I mean, I guess the first question is why do you think going back to

01:16.600 --> 01:24.560
Plato is of relevance or of such importance? Right. Well, in a lot of ways,

01:24.720 --> 01:29.600
Plato was in a similar situation to the one that we're in. The traditions of his

01:29.600 --> 01:33.760
time had been breaking down. You know, if you look at the behavior of the

01:33.760 --> 01:39.600
Sophists, it resembles that of postmodern academics today, deconstructing things,

01:39.600 --> 01:45.040
saying the truth is relative, having no reverence for the gods or eternal

01:45.040 --> 01:49.040
realities and things of that nature, reducing everything to kind of flux

01:49.120 --> 01:54.320
and accidents of the one kind of true material substrate materialistic monism.

01:55.680 --> 02:04.640
And Plato found a way of harmonizing the gods, his tradition, his the ways of his

02:04.640 --> 02:11.120
people with this rationalistic current. And the historical influence obviously

02:11.120 --> 02:16.000
alone justifies going back to Plato. I don't think you can really seriously

02:16.000 --> 02:21.920
claim to be a philosopher or to seriously study philosophy unless you go through

02:21.920 --> 02:27.600
the works of Plato, not just because there are so many fundamental ideas introduced

02:27.600 --> 02:32.640
into the history of Western philosophy through Plato, but because the rest of

02:32.640 --> 02:37.680
the philosophical tradition is responding to Plato in one way or another, often

02:37.680 --> 02:44.640
uncharitably, you know, unfairly Nietzsche's critiques of Plato I see is so much

02:44.640 --> 02:51.840
question begging. I know Heidegger has some critiques and often people in these spheres

02:51.840 --> 02:55.920
will have read some of these critiques or have heard about some of these critiques of

02:55.920 --> 03:00.320
Platonism. And then without actually studying Platonism, they write it off because

03:00.880 --> 03:05.680
the people that they respect write it off. I think it's a similar phenomenon to the people

03:05.680 --> 03:10.640
who get into like alternative physics you'll often find or at least I often find these people

03:10.720 --> 03:17.040
on YouTube who have this, you know, new model of physics like vortex physics or physics derived

03:17.040 --> 03:23.680
from like the 10 basic numbers, kind of like Pythagoreanism. But the reason people go for

03:23.680 --> 03:28.960
those things is that the people putting forward these radical alternatives at the same time are

03:28.960 --> 03:33.440
saying the entire history of mathematics and physics up until this time has been wrong.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
And then you watching the video say, oh, well, that's convenient because I don't know any of that

03:38.000 --> 03:43.680
anyway. So now I can just listen to this guy and get it all from him. So I think this kind of anti

03:43.680 --> 03:52.000
Platonism offers an out from doing the real work of learning the Western philosophical tradition

03:52.000 --> 03:57.360
from the ground up. You can't understand any of antique philosophy without understanding Platonism.

03:57.360 --> 04:01.840
You can't understand scholasticism. You can't understand the thinking of the Renaissance.

04:01.840 --> 04:07.120
You really just can't understand anything in the history of Western philosophy without Plato.

04:07.120 --> 04:12.240
And like I said, the main reason, though, is that we're in a similar position where if we don't

04:12.240 --> 04:19.920
harmonize the scientific knowledge that we have today with metaphysics, with our traditional

04:19.920 --> 04:27.760
theological conceptions, many of which basically all of which derived from Platonism, we're not

04:27.760 --> 04:33.360
going to have something to unify us going forward. It takes more than just kind of

04:34.000 --> 04:44.000
emotive, you know, something a, you know, ineffable quality that people have in a particular sphere

04:44.000 --> 04:50.240
that galvanizes them. Like that's not what actually builds long lasting historical movements.

04:50.240 --> 04:58.480
There has to be a kind of crystalline ideological core that keeps an organization going keeps a

04:58.480 --> 05:06.160
group going and motivates them. Pythagoreanism did that. Platonism did that through institutions on

05:06.160 --> 05:12.400
the one hand schools and a core philosophy that people shared in common that explicit

05:12.400 --> 05:17.440
philosophical consensus is the only way to get ethical consensus. So, you know, political

05:17.440 --> 05:23.840
practicalities, learning the history of Western philosophy, and then also, which I didn't mention

05:23.840 --> 05:31.440
yet, I do think that Platonism has the metaphysical toolkit to address the metaphysical deficiencies

05:31.440 --> 05:37.040
of modern physics, right? We have excellent understanding of dynamics in modern physics,

05:37.040 --> 05:43.040
but we don't know very much at all about the substrate. What are these things that are behaving

05:43.040 --> 05:47.840
in the ways that the wave function behaves? You know, what is the stuff that the universe is made

05:47.840 --> 05:56.160
of? And what categories can we draw metaphysically to make sense of all of that? So, Platonism is just

05:56.160 --> 06:01.520
one of the most well developed metaphysical frameworks in history. And I think anyone who's

06:01.520 --> 06:06.240
trying a theory of everything these days, like I saw you had Chris Langan on, you know, he's

06:06.240 --> 06:11.120
a key example. I mean, a lot of his ideas are similar to Platonism. I think he would recognize

06:11.120 --> 06:18.960
that. So, yeah, I mean, I think to understand the past, to put us together, gather us together

06:18.960 --> 06:26.160
today in a harmony, and then moving forward for better scientific groundwork for a worldview.

06:27.120 --> 06:33.040
Yeah, well, there is that quote by Alfred North Whitehead that the safest generalization of

06:33.040 --> 06:39.680
Western philosophy is the series of footnotes to Plato. And I saw an exaggeration like Richard

06:39.680 --> 06:49.360
Rorty, who's the famous American pragmatist, or like a, you know, a complete relativist,

06:49.360 --> 06:56.160
moral relativist, he rejects philosophy. And I forget which one of his books it was,

06:56.160 --> 07:03.200
but he wrote in the introduction that his task was basically to get rid of Platonism.

07:04.160 --> 07:10.560
And he also, he made some, might seem like a radical claim, but he said that all philosophy

07:10.560 --> 07:16.960
since Plato was Platonism, because his claim was that even the people that have rejected Plato have

07:16.960 --> 07:24.880
done so with kind of Platonist starting point, and even just the idea that, you know, thought and

07:24.880 --> 07:31.680
reality, cohere in the way Plato imagined. But yeah, I mean, I do think it's a problem,

07:31.680 --> 07:37.040
especially in like sort of, you know, the St. Raider where you want to call it circles, that

07:37.040 --> 07:44.400
people, people obviously come at philosophy, you know, at other motivations, they're not necessarily

07:44.400 --> 07:52.000
trying to get a great grasp of the whole Western canon. I guess they generally have a more instrumental

07:52.000 --> 07:57.520
view of things. And so I find you get too much, you get a focus on, you know, thinkers like

07:57.520 --> 08:04.480
Evella, Spengler, Nietzsche, obviously. But people want to kind of, you know, they want like

08:04.480 --> 08:09.360
to kind of a simple metric to kind of read all of Western thought through some kind of based

08:09.360 --> 08:17.680
metrics like Nietzscheanism, or even like kind of a very simplified, like a Heideggerian critique

08:17.680 --> 08:25.920
of techniques and of philosophy. And yeah, that definitely leads to oversight. I think there is

08:25.920 --> 08:33.200
a kind of like, you know, meme Nietzscheanism that permeates the right a lot, especially as it

08:33.200 --> 08:40.880
comes to Plato. So I mean, the basic kind of Nietzschean critique of Plato, you see something

08:40.880 --> 08:49.520
like Spencer said this a lot that Plato was like the, it was the start of this nihilism that came

08:49.520 --> 08:57.280
to fruition with Christianity, where we started to kind of lessen the value of the physical world,

08:57.280 --> 09:03.120
and imagine this perfect world of forms. And that as soon as that, as soon as we started that endeavor,

09:03.120 --> 09:11.520
as soon as we started to try and find some perfect world of pure thought, or, you know,

09:11.520 --> 09:16.320
so there's some other world that we started on the path to nihilism, and it was kind of inevitably

09:16.320 --> 09:23.520
going to lead to all of the kind of life denying philosophies we have now and some of the, even

09:23.520 --> 09:27.680
like the sort of extreme liberalism, some people argue that like in the, you know, the kind of

09:27.680 --> 09:37.600
transhumanist ethic. So I'm curious, like, what do you think of that kind of basic kind of quasi

09:37.600 --> 09:44.560
Nietzschean criticism of Platonism? Yeah, like, so again, I don't know exactly how true that is to

09:44.560 --> 09:49.360
Nietzsche himself, but it is characteristically Nietzschean in the sense that it's not really an

09:49.360 --> 09:53.760
argument, strictly speaking. It's saying, you know, I don't like the conclusion that you came to.

09:54.320 --> 09:59.440
I'm sentimentally averse, like saying that it leads to nihilism is a kind of moral consequentialism

09:59.440 --> 10:09.920
from a moral nihilist, which doesn't even make sense. But yeah, I think the the issue that

10:10.880 --> 10:16.480
Nietzsche has with Platonism is not unique to Platonism. You go all the way back to, like,

10:16.480 --> 10:23.680
Siberian shamanism, presumably from the Paleolithic period, and they had this idea that the world

10:23.680 --> 10:29.280
was divided up into different realms, you know, like you see in Norse mythology on Yigitrasil.

10:29.280 --> 10:36.320
There are various realms that you can travel between. And there's good reason why people had these

10:36.400 --> 10:45.760
beliefs. There has been a history of spiritual practice that led a lot of people around the

10:45.760 --> 10:51.440
world to common ideas about what sorts of realms are accessible, what sorts of forces

10:52.080 --> 10:58.800
are there to tap into in that realm. If they were all completely wrong, if there is no,

10:58.880 --> 11:07.840
you know, supernatural realm whatsoever, then why did these beliefs all persist? And it's just,

11:07.840 --> 11:13.840
you know, question begging saying there isn't any such thing. But you can't just presume that you

11:13.840 --> 11:20.400
can't just presuppose the world simply is time, space, causality, and what we see around us. And

11:20.400 --> 11:26.240
that's it. If you buy an evolutionary explanation of perception, which I assume most people who

11:26.240 --> 11:34.480
would buy that pseudo Nietzschean critique would, you wouldn't expect evolution to select for the

11:34.480 --> 11:42.080
perceptual apparatus that would perceive the genuine like ontological substrate of reality.

11:42.080 --> 11:50.000
You would expect evolution to select for perception of fitness payoffs above all. So we'll be

11:50.000 --> 11:58.080
myopically focused on certain facets of reality, like this narrow spectrum of the electromagnetic

11:59.600 --> 12:05.920
spectrum that's narrow bandwidth, visible light. But we don't actually, you know,

12:05.920 --> 12:11.280
know reality just because we see things. This is the way that we navigate is like a user interface

12:11.280 --> 12:17.680
that has developed to help us survive as biological creatures. There's no reason to think that

12:17.680 --> 12:24.480
the categories, the basic intuitive naive categories like matter naively conceived just

12:24.480 --> 12:30.560
is what reality is at base. According to evolutionary theory, wouldn't expect that an

12:30.560 --> 12:35.440
evolutionary game theory, Donald Hoffman came up with the, the fitness beats truth theorem.

12:36.160 --> 12:42.880
And he modeled various evolutionary scenarios and demonstrated that, you know, evolution does not

12:42.880 --> 12:49.840
select for perception of the true nature of whatever system this evolution is taking place in.

12:49.840 --> 12:58.640
It selects for like myopic perception of fitness payoffs. And the key insight of Platonism and

12:58.640 --> 13:05.040
Pythagoras before him was saying that actually, you know, the way that the world seems at face

13:05.920 --> 13:14.240
masks, a deeper harmony that operates according to, you know, different logic than the logic of

13:14.240 --> 13:19.520
everyday reality, you know, bumping into stuff, things colliding like base naive materialism.

13:19.520 --> 13:24.560
Actually, when you investigate the things of the material world and kind of draw down to their

13:24.560 --> 13:31.840
syntactic core, the underlying logic behind mundane phenomena, we find these mathematical

13:31.840 --> 13:40.640
structures. And that line, that Platonizing line of putting an ontological status on

13:40.640 --> 13:46.960
universals and mathematical objects led to taking those things seriously, building out a

13:46.960 --> 13:56.880
mathematical model of the world. And that actually led to scientific progress. Right. So the idea

13:56.880 --> 14:03.760
of another world is not prima facia ridiculous. It would kind of be strange if the universe in

14:03.760 --> 14:09.600
its entirety was simply what we see around us, like the observable universe just is reality.

14:10.480 --> 14:15.520
We don't have an explanation if we just go with this kind of naive perception of the world as

14:15.520 --> 14:20.640
it seems, we don't have an explanation for where the laws of physics reside. We don't have an

14:20.640 --> 14:26.320
explanation for what universal properties are what ontological status they have. Right. It's

14:26.320 --> 14:33.760
just a very incomplete model of the world that like, and we know that that kind of perception of

14:33.760 --> 14:39.760
the world as being fundamentally flux, you know, inevitably tied to matter, didn't actually build

14:40.480 --> 14:46.720
the math science technology that the modern world is based on. It was the the Platonizers

14:46.720 --> 14:52.160
through our history. You mentioned Alfred North Whitehead, you know, he worked with

14:52.240 --> 14:58.000
Bertrand Russell, who also studied Plato. He criticized Plato in his history of Western

14:58.000 --> 15:03.600
philosophy book. But a lot of his mature developments are obviously inspired by Platonism,

15:03.600 --> 15:09.840
including this kind of intermediate status of mathematical objects. And so they tried to work

15:09.840 --> 15:15.280
up something that was actually in the spirit of Leibniz, a kind of characteristic universalist

15:15.760 --> 15:22.480
universal logical language with their Principia Mathematica, which was largely successful.

15:23.200 --> 15:29.120
Their kind of systematizing of logic mathematics led to developments in computer.

15:30.080 --> 15:36.320
So it was practically useful. But Russell, who was inspired by Platonism, wouldn't have had

15:36.320 --> 15:41.600
this idea unless he was a scholar of Leibniz, which he was, and Leibniz was a Platonist. And

15:41.600 --> 15:47.440
his ideas fit very neatly into Neoplatonism, up to including the idea of the monad, this kind of

15:47.440 --> 15:51.920
fractal embodiment that the monad possesses, we can maybe get into a little bit, a little bit of

15:51.920 --> 15:59.120
that later. You know, Frege, who started analytical philosophy, was a Platonist. And then Goethel,

15:59.120 --> 16:06.400
who disproved the basic intention of Principia Mathematica, which was inspired by this computationalist

16:06.400 --> 16:11.200
theory of mathematics, where if we just have the right set of axioms and algorithms, we can have

16:11.200 --> 16:18.000
full systematic proof of all propositions. Goethel said, no, you can't. And, you know, that was because

16:18.000 --> 16:24.560
Goethel grasped an aspect of our cognitive faculties that the Platonist grasped that

16:25.360 --> 16:31.280
Russell wanted to leave out, which was intellect, properly speaking, or the mathematical intuition,

16:31.280 --> 16:36.880
which is not exclusively mathematical. But anyway, it's just you see the influence of

16:37.840 --> 16:44.160
Platonism through and through with the history of modern philosophy, ancient philosophy. And to say

16:44.160 --> 16:49.280
you don't like the idea of some other realm or that there's something beyond the world that we see,

16:49.280 --> 16:55.760
like, where does that come from? I get the kind of instinct to say, like, you know, the way I've

16:55.760 --> 17:01.200
always thought about the world since I was three, the basic way I perceive things, that's just what

17:01.200 --> 17:07.120
it is. And we don't have to go beyond that. And all this math, well, we like abstract the math from

17:07.120 --> 17:12.640
the world. And while that may be in a certain regard epistemologically true, not wholly true,

17:12.640 --> 17:21.600
because we also have these intuitions that are not via induction. Yeah, we, nevertheless, you

17:21.600 --> 17:26.480
can't make sense of that kind of account of mathematical objects of universals without, at the

17:26.480 --> 17:32.160
same time, relying on their ultimate validity, like to express the position of nominalism,

17:32.160 --> 17:38.160
you're going to have to use Platonic realism or a belief in the reality of universals. I might be

17:38.160 --> 17:43.200
using a bit too much philosophical jargon for people who are not already into Platonism. But

17:44.080 --> 17:51.440
well, I mean, it's a very, it's a very nihilistic position in a way to take this kind of

17:51.840 --> 17:57.840
sort of meme, natuionism approach to everything where you're kind of judging,

17:58.880 --> 18:03.440
you're judging theories based on like how life affirming there, like you're treating philosophy

18:03.440 --> 18:12.000
as this sort of therapeutic existentialist cure to the human condition. And you know,

18:12.000 --> 18:16.080
you're already presupposing that there's there's no objective truth to be found or you're already

18:16.080 --> 18:20.800
presupposing like this metaphysical anti realism. But someone in someone in the chat said,

18:21.920 --> 18:25.360
you know, we're going to be discussing Platonism. So he said, you know, and get ready to hear loads

18:25.360 --> 18:31.120
of things that aren't epistemically justified. So I guess that that would be another attitude.

18:32.160 --> 18:37.200
You definitely find it a lot in people that study philosophy now that they kind of assume

18:37.200 --> 18:41.840
that well, you know, you have classical philosophy here. But you know, something happened along the

18:41.840 --> 18:48.880
way. And these people didn't really interrogate their kind of epistemological starting point,

18:48.880 --> 18:52.960
you know, they didn't they didn't really interrogate like what the mind can can really

18:52.960 --> 18:57.680
know about the world. And you know, we've had Hume and Kant and these people sense and, you know,

18:57.680 --> 19:04.080
the kind of Copernican turn turn in philosophy. And so this kind of naive kind of approach to

19:04.080 --> 19:10.880
metaphysics is is very outdated. And you're kind of better starting with with more sort of

19:11.920 --> 19:19.600
analytical stuff. So like, what would you say the the starting point is for you as a Platonist?

19:19.600 --> 19:24.640
Like, you know, do you assume a kind of naive, you know, are you just sort of start with the

19:24.640 --> 19:31.280
assumption that there's this coherence between the mind and ultimate reality? Or do you think

19:31.280 --> 19:36.480
that there's like a series of sort of smaller scale justifications along the way that have to

19:36.480 --> 19:43.360
bring you there? Like, do you start with epistemology? Yeah, well, I'm not a foundationalist

19:44.480 --> 19:48.160
in my own philosophy. So there's no one starting point, you know, I like

19:49.280 --> 19:58.080
Quine Willard Quine's Holism, where, you know, inevitably, one proposition, one theory will

19:58.080 --> 20:04.800
implicate other theories in your kind of toolkit. And so ultimately, a whole worldview has to develop

20:04.880 --> 20:11.680
organically. And in terms of internal consistency, and then in terms of explanatory power, in terms of

20:11.680 --> 20:16.880
predictive power, all of these metrics, and then you evaluate whole frameworks on that basis,

20:16.880 --> 20:24.080
rather than the foundationalist attempt at epistemological grounding, where like empiricism,

20:24.080 --> 20:29.840
all knowledge is built up from sense data. And that's, you know, this kind of model of how we

20:29.840 --> 20:36.160
come to have knowledge was really, you know, devastated by Willard Quine in, I think, the 50s.

20:37.440 --> 20:44.480
So in analytical philosophy today, that's not a popular epistemological position. Actually,

20:44.480 --> 20:52.160
that innovation, this kind of Holism and pragmatism, Quine was a pragmatist, was already there in

20:52.880 --> 21:02.240
the old academy, under carnities, I think, when the Platonists took a turn towards skepticism,

21:02.240 --> 21:08.560
academic skepticism, was very different from the other ancient, the other popular ancient

21:08.560 --> 21:14.240
skeptical school of Pyranism, which basically held that all knowledge is simply impossible. And it

21:14.240 --> 21:19.680
was mostly about just kind of reaching a this catharsis and, you know, comfortable state of

21:19.680 --> 21:24.720
mind, resting in a poria, resting in uncertainty, you know, what, what are you going to do? You

21:24.720 --> 21:31.120
can't really figure out anything anyway. Whereas academic skepticism was about like, let's put

21:31.120 --> 21:37.760
forward hypotheses and build up this theory while admitting our own fallibility all the while.

21:38.800 --> 21:47.280
Now, within Platonism, there are theories about the basis of higher level knowledge. I think the

21:47.280 --> 21:53.520
most famous example is the divided line from the Republic. So if you remember in book seven of the

21:53.520 --> 21:59.760
Republic, when he discusses the cave, he illustrates the example of the cave afterwards with this

21:59.760 --> 22:06.720
concept of the divided line. So you take a line, which symbolizes the unity of mind as a whole,

22:06.720 --> 22:13.120
divide it in two, but unequally. So one part is larger, one part is smaller, the largeness of

22:13.120 --> 22:22.000
this segment of the line represents the security and, you know, firmness of our grasping of

22:22.000 --> 22:28.080
intelligible. So the larger segment is intelligible reality. And then the smaller segment is sensible

22:28.080 --> 22:35.200
reality. And we have faculties associated with each of these targets of knowledge. So we have

22:35.200 --> 22:41.680
two discrete faculties that deal with intelligibles and two discrete faculties which deal with

22:41.680 --> 22:48.960
sensibles. And so you divide the shorter segment according to the same ratio, which is the ratio

22:48.960 --> 22:57.120
of bi, and the smallest of all segments will have to do with our recognition of images as such.

22:57.120 --> 23:02.000
You know, Schopenhauer had a similar distinction between, you know, pure sensation and perception.

23:02.880 --> 23:08.640
So for, this is already there in Neoplatonism by the time of Iamblichus and arguably, I mean,

23:08.640 --> 23:14.080
by the time of Plato himself, Iamblichus actually ascribes the concept of the divided line and these,

23:14.960 --> 23:21.520
this theory of cognitive faculties to Architas of Tarentum, who is an elder contemporary of Plato,

23:21.520 --> 23:29.120
early member of the Academy, you know, genuine, you know, old Pythagorean contributed to development

23:29.120 --> 23:38.000
mathematics and all of that. But yeah, this, so at the bottom, we have this faculty of basically

23:38.000 --> 23:43.360
sensation or imagination, which has to do with recognizing similarity and dissimilarity. That's

23:43.360 --> 23:49.920
the distinguishing feature of that cognitive faculty, which is Icazia in Greek. And then we have

23:50.480 --> 23:56.400
doxar belief, which is what Schopenhauer would call perception, where instead of just treating the raw

23:56.400 --> 24:02.800
kind of phenomenological appearance of form and distinguishing forms in that lower sense,

24:02.800 --> 24:10.000
like the shape of things in their similarity, we have the, you know, hypothesis of some underlying

24:10.000 --> 24:17.680
reality, which we only know by inference, just as Schopenhauer says, we don't know the objects of

24:17.680 --> 24:24.560
material reality directly. We infer from the presence of sense data, you know, Locke basically

24:24.560 --> 24:30.000
agrees with this, this model of things as well, and they got it from the ancients, you know,

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
this stuff was already there in Plato. And then on the intelligible side, the smaller faculty

24:36.640 --> 24:43.440
is Dianoya, which is discursive reasoning, which is step by step procedures, you know,

24:43.440 --> 24:49.600
similar to the computationalist project of Russell and Whitehead. And then above

24:49.920 --> 24:57.920
that kind of reason, there is intellect or noose, which is an intuitive faculty, and you have to

24:57.920 --> 25:05.280
have this idea to make mathematics work. There has to be something in our mind that allows us to find

25:05.840 --> 25:13.600
correct axioms for mathematics, right? You can't prove the validity of an axiom in math through

25:13.600 --> 25:18.160
any mathematical formal system. So there has to be something beyond Dianoya that we're using there.

25:19.120 --> 25:27.600
So this basic, you know, schema of the psyche, I think holds pretty true, you know, and it's

25:27.600 --> 25:33.120
interesting that Dianoya has a kind of dual role. So there's a strict sense of Dianoya where we see

25:33.120 --> 25:40.080
its peculiar energies, activities, most starkly, which is in mathematical and logical reasoning,

25:40.080 --> 25:47.280
but also the literal translation is through thinking. And it is what basically moves us

25:47.280 --> 25:57.120
from Icazia to Daxa to Dianoya, strictly speaking, to the intellect. And yeah, so there's something

25:57.680 --> 26:05.520
mathematical or logical or like Turing machine like about human cognition, broadly speaking. And

26:07.120 --> 26:12.320
yeah, that's it's a very interesting notion that ties in with the idea of the soul, the composition

26:12.320 --> 26:17.440
of the soul, the essence of the soul that you see in the Timaeus, when the Demiurge constructs

26:17.440 --> 26:23.520
the world soul, he constructs that soul out of ratios. He takes the powers of two and the powers

26:23.520 --> 26:31.520
of three, and through a set of kind of algorithmic procedures, builds all of the ratios that we get

26:32.240 --> 26:39.520
in music of the perfect fifth, perfect fourth, octave, and so forth. And, you know, this is

26:39.520 --> 26:46.720
the composition of the essence of the soul in some way. So math is on the same level as soul.

26:46.720 --> 26:51.120
Some people might have heard in Platonism that mathematical objects are an intermediary level

26:51.120 --> 26:58.560
between the forms, which are unitive, unextended, and then material reality, which is divisible

26:58.560 --> 27:06.880
about body. So math is an intermediary. So is soul. So soul and math are very intimately related. And,

27:06.880 --> 27:12.640
you know, if we're going to follow the prescription of the Delphic Oracle to know

27:12.640 --> 27:18.720
thyself, we also have to know math, which kind of ties into this idea, like people criticize

27:18.720 --> 27:25.840
Plato for turning his back on tradition. Well, I mean, he references one commandment from the

27:25.840 --> 27:31.520
Oracle to double the size of a particular altar, and they realized that they couldn't do it

27:31.520 --> 27:37.440
mathematically, because they didn't know how to calculate double the volume of this shape.

27:38.640 --> 27:44.320
So it revealed a kind of defect of mathematical reasoning. So in that instance, Plato refers

27:44.320 --> 27:48.560
to what are the gods telling us? They're telling us we don't know enough math yet.

27:49.920 --> 27:53.760
And, yeah, I kind of ramble a little bit at the end there. But

27:54.000 --> 28:02.480
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was muted. Yeah, that's another kind of interesting

28:02.480 --> 28:09.280
disagreement is the time when Plato came along. So again, this is where you get there's kind of

28:09.280 --> 28:14.240
a Nietzschean version of this versus kind of a more traditionalist version of this. So

28:15.520 --> 28:19.760
the kind of Nietzschean version of it is that, you know, Socrates should have been put to debt

28:19.760 --> 28:27.280
because he was questioning the gods. He was undermining the social order of where he lived.

28:27.920 --> 28:33.680
And, you know, he was trying to apply universal reason in this way that was kind of undermining

28:33.680 --> 28:40.720
the particularist paganism of his society. And again, that this is like a very nihilistic enterprise.

28:40.720 --> 28:47.600
Now, if you read Julius Evela actually criticizes this few a lot, he says that this is like a

28:47.600 --> 28:53.520
really bad reading of things that actually what Plato was doing was in a current where

28:54.320 --> 29:00.320
Sophism and Humanism had become kind of dominant intellectually, he says it's actually very

29:00.320 --> 29:03.280
similar to our own time that what Plato was actually doing was kind of,

29:04.640 --> 29:10.320
you know, he's kind of revivifying like a traditionalist cosmology. So again, it's kind

29:10.320 --> 29:15.200
of interesting. It's two very different readings. You know, Plato is this sort of

29:15.200 --> 29:21.840
libtard revolutionary that's like subversive Socrates subversive versus actually, you know,

29:21.840 --> 29:28.640
Plato is seeing like the nihilistic elements thought of his time and he's trying to have

29:28.640 --> 29:35.040
things on this more solid foundation and I kind of ground a proper view of things again.

29:35.040 --> 29:39.520
So, yeah, can you speak to that a little bit like the, you know, the time frame where Plato

29:39.520 --> 29:44.000
was operating like kind of the popular current of thought that he's responding to and what you

29:44.000 --> 29:49.200
think of that idea of it being kind of subversive to the society at the time?

29:51.120 --> 29:58.000
Right, yeah. Well, the reason why Socrates probably was actually put to death was his

29:58.000 --> 30:04.080
connection with members of the 30 tyrants, the puppet regime that Sparta installed after the

30:04.080 --> 30:10.160
end of the Peloponnesian War. There's a lot of quotes throughout the dialogues where Socrates

30:10.160 --> 30:14.320
seems to reverence the Spartans, you know, mentioned that they are actually really good

30:14.320 --> 30:20.800
philosophers and that's why they have these laconic sayings. They're so pithy. So it was

30:20.800 --> 30:28.560
probably a matter of questioning Socrates' loyalty and, you know, the charge of impiety

30:28.560 --> 30:35.040
and was he questioning the gods? I mean, if you look at, you know, again, in the Republic,

30:35.040 --> 30:41.440
Thrasomachus or in the Gorgias, Calakles, the way these characters, the kind of protonegians of

30:41.440 --> 30:48.560
their day, were talking about the gods was far more sacrilegious than anything Socrates ever

30:48.560 --> 30:55.680
indicated. And I think Plato had a sincere piety. I mean, Neoplatonists all the way down to late

30:55.680 --> 31:03.040
antiquity were, you know, practicing their rights. They were worshiping the gods. So this charge of

31:03.600 --> 31:10.960
sacrilege or impiety or denying the existence of the gods was probably just an excuse to get

31:10.960 --> 31:18.240
rid of someone who the, you know, Democrats in power in Athens, viewed to be a threat to the

31:18.240 --> 31:24.160
state because of their questionable loyalty. And then the large influence they had on

31:25.920 --> 31:31.520
prominent young noble citizens, you know, Socrates would go around the city finding,

31:31.520 --> 31:39.760
you know, the Alcibiades is the competent, talented young men, not to indulge whatever

31:39.760 --> 31:46.960
pederastic impulse he may have had, which he never endorses explicitly. Plato never endorses that

31:46.960 --> 31:54.720
it is acknowledged as a common sentiment, you know, among many different Greek city states.

31:54.720 --> 31:59.440
But Plato rejects that anyway. But it wasn't for that reason that Socrates associated with

31:59.440 --> 32:05.440
young men, it was to influence the future thinking of the political class of Athens.

32:07.040 --> 32:14.320
So yeah, I mean, I see Plato basically is trying to save respect for the gods,

32:15.040 --> 32:22.320
respect for this higher realm from the deconstruction of people like Gorgias or

32:22.320 --> 32:28.800
Protagoras. I mean, the Sophists are really one of the chief currents that he's responding to,

32:28.800 --> 32:36.560
but also the rationalistic philosophy of the Ionian school, you know, the best example

32:36.560 --> 32:44.560
that directly influenced Plato was Anaxagoras, who taught Pericles, the great Athenian statesman,

32:45.120 --> 32:52.480
and also Socrates studied the works of Anaxagoras. And what Plato liked about Anaxagoras was the

32:52.480 --> 32:57.120
put this principle of mind first, which none of the other Ionian preseocratics did. They

32:57.120 --> 33:01.840
kept things very kind of physical in their conception, although I do think that's an oversimplification.

33:02.480 --> 33:10.320
But with the actual writings of Anaxagoras, according to Socrates in the, which dialogue was

33:10.320 --> 33:18.240
this, might even be Thedo, not sure. But anyway, he says that Anaxagoras, the writings had to do

33:18.240 --> 33:25.200
with like physical laws. He was more like a physicist than a philosopher, strictly speaking.

33:25.200 --> 33:30.880
And it was this rationalism combined with the deconstructing Sophists and

33:30.880 --> 33:36.560
rhetoricians of his day that Plato had to respond to. And they were sacrilegious. I mean,

33:37.760 --> 33:42.400
the Orphism was just a kind of history of the

33:45.360 --> 33:53.120
tendencies in that day. Orphism spread from around 600 BC in the wake of basically a dying

33:53.120 --> 34:00.400
off of respect for the older, you know, perhaps Mycenaean way of worshiping the gods. So they

34:00.400 --> 34:07.200
already broke down their their previous religious rituals. And Orphism came in the wake of that

34:07.200 --> 34:14.000
with this kind of more mystical, more experiential brand of religion. And of course, the mystery

34:14.000 --> 34:21.040
schools were still popular. But there was a kind of irrationalism introduced. And, you know, an

34:21.040 --> 34:28.880
emphasis on individual experience. And basically, Plato had to fit that brand of spirituality

34:28.880 --> 34:34.240
together with this rationalistic philosophy. And then the Pythagorean influence coming from

34:35.360 --> 34:42.000
the Eliadex, the Italian school. And yeah, I mean, he just kind of found the best harmony to bring

34:42.000 --> 34:46.480
it all together. I think we might actually be overestimating how much is original to Plato,

34:46.480 --> 34:51.680
because we don't know very much about his Pythagorean associates, we have a couple fragments of

34:51.680 --> 34:59.200
Arcatas, of, you know, Philo Laos, or some of the other people, or Aristocenus or something in his

34:59.200 --> 35:05.920
school. But Plato was originally interested in writing plays, he wrote poems. And then when

35:05.920 --> 35:12.000
he met Socrates, he decided, this isn't the way to go, I have to do something in the vein of this

35:12.800 --> 35:19.360
emerging trend of philosophy, which he correctly foresaw, would have this massive influence on

35:19.360 --> 35:25.280
society. And so he shifted his artistic endeavors, but he kind of remains like,

35:26.240 --> 35:32.640
really tied to the format of the dialogue, to constructing these organic holes, you know,

35:33.360 --> 35:40.720
his concepts and aesthetics, many of which were probably original, can be seen today still in

35:40.720 --> 35:46.080
concepts like what makes an integrated work of art. But that's, I think, where Plato's heart was,

35:46.080 --> 35:52.880
and he fit all of these tendencies of thought into one harmonious whole. So he was really a

35:52.880 --> 36:00.640
synthesizer of the ideas at his time. And, you know, he did it successfully, he built the institution

36:00.640 --> 36:06.640
that needed to be built, and his way of thinking largely won out. Although, of course, Aristotle

36:06.640 --> 36:11.920
disagreed in certain ways, he was still largely a Platonist, you know, the agreement between Aristotle

36:11.920 --> 36:18.960
and Plato is much greater than the disagreement. And so Aristotle gets kind of more credit,

36:18.960 --> 36:26.000
perhaps because, as Alexander spread Hellenism, you know, Aristotle had a pride of place for a

36:26.000 --> 36:34.160
couple centuries, and then later Platonism had a resurgence. So, you know, there's an argument

36:34.160 --> 36:41.840
to be made that maybe Aristotle contributed more in certain respects than Plato. Again,

36:41.840 --> 36:47.440
I'm kind of digressing from your point. But yeah, I think Plato is trying to harmonize the currents

36:47.440 --> 36:52.960
of his day, and save the gods and save his traditional ways of worship, and at the same time,

36:52.960 --> 36:57.120
arrive at the truth underlying reality. It's like this nihilism that you mentioned,

36:58.240 --> 37:02.080
you can't just want the world to be a certain way, and then like,

37:02.080 --> 37:07.040
blind yourself to what may actually be out there. You can't know the nature of underlying

37:07.040 --> 37:12.800
reality unless you question these basic concepts. If you just presume that there are no universals,

37:12.800 --> 37:18.080
there are only particulars, and realities, this basic flux, like, why do you think that,

37:19.200 --> 37:24.080
how do you justify that? If you're going to try to build a rationalistic framework,

37:24.080 --> 37:27.920
you're going to have to basically go along with what Plato did. Plato was the first one to do it

37:27.920 --> 37:33.840
in a serious way, the Pythagoreans, and then Plato. And there's, everyone kind of followed in his

37:33.840 --> 37:40.000
train because there's probably one true nature to reality. And, you know, this is the perennial

37:40.000 --> 37:46.240
philosophy idea, you're not going to digress from that very far. And so if Plato put it adequately,

37:46.880 --> 37:52.480
then kind of have to take the tools that you're given. And Plato is very traditional for us.

37:52.480 --> 37:58.720
I mean, you can't understand modern Western civilization without him. So, yeah.

37:58.720 --> 38:05.520
Yeah, Platonism is, it is the kind of metaphysics of the perennial philosophy. I mean,

38:06.480 --> 38:11.920
I think Shu'an of the traditional school basically considered neoplatonism,

38:12.880 --> 38:18.000
like kind of a divine revelation to the West, like it's the Western version of the perennial

38:18.000 --> 38:22.880
philosophy. But you mentioned Pythagoras. I remember, I don't know if you saw,

38:23.920 --> 38:29.920
like a decade ago, they supposedly uncovered that there was like a secret Pythagorean message

38:29.920 --> 38:35.760
in the Republic that every 12 lines, there was a mention of music and they were speculating that

38:35.760 --> 38:41.120
you could, you could create like musical notes out of out of messages he'd inserted in there

38:41.120 --> 38:47.760
with numbers. And that this was a sign that Plato was like a secret Pythagorean because the Pythagorean

38:47.760 --> 38:55.200
sect was persecuted at the time. Now Pythagoras, you know, obviously like the vegetarianism and

38:55.200 --> 39:01.280
some of his ideas, I think there is a popular idea that he got his philosophy from India, right,

39:01.280 --> 39:08.560
that he traveled to India and he kind of brought back Vedanta. There's also, I don't know if this

39:08.560 --> 39:14.480
is confirmed, but there's also theories that Plato took his philosophy from like mystery schools in

39:14.480 --> 39:22.320
Egypt. So do you have any insight in terms of like kind of like an esoteric element to Plato or

39:22.320 --> 39:28.800
kind of a religious origin of his teachings? Or, you know, is the similarities to the perennial

39:28.800 --> 39:33.520
philosophy? Is that just kind of a testament to, you know, reason brings you to this system if you

39:33.520 --> 39:41.920
follow it fair enough? Yeah, my basic model of the axial age as a whole is that it diffuses from

39:41.920 --> 39:48.400
the Punjab basically. The Upanishadic philosophy originates around year 1000 BC,

39:49.040 --> 39:55.200
and then we see movements towards rationalistic, I mean, Upanishads are written in dialogue form,

39:55.200 --> 40:04.080
that's healthy something, many of them. So these ideas of perennialism I see is coming out of India

40:04.080 --> 40:11.840
primarily, although there may be more ancient, similar systems out of Egypt. So like we have

40:11.840 --> 40:17.120
to remember this time period in the aftermath of the Bronze Age collapse, right? There was a

40:17.760 --> 40:26.960
2000 year long civilization from 3000 BC to 1000 BC, very roughly speaking, that was on a larger

40:26.960 --> 40:34.880
scale in many ways, better organized than the state of things in the Greek Dark Ages, for example,

40:34.880 --> 40:41.760
which is the times that, you know, classical antiquity comes out of. And those Bronze Age

40:41.760 --> 40:48.320
civilizations had a common source, right? Prior to the civilizations properly speaking, there were

40:48.320 --> 40:58.640
advanced, you know, city based cultures in Syria, in Iraq, you know, the Fertile Crescent, and,

40:59.520 --> 41:05.200
you know, in Egypt, starting around 5000 BC, arguably a little bit older, but going all the way back

41:05.200 --> 41:10.480
to 10,000 BC. And this happens with the spread of Neolithic technologies generally, they're

41:10.480 --> 41:15.440
identifiable gene clusters that are associated with this, that we are related to in many ways. So

41:15.440 --> 41:20.720
like a lot of people want to go back to the Bronze Age and learn as Aryans or whatever. But like

41:20.720 --> 41:28.720
we're also this kind of ancient Neolithic, Neolithicizing force, like a third of our

41:28.720 --> 41:34.640
ancestry is associated with that Anatolian hunter-gatherer population that was integral to the

41:34.640 --> 41:41.040
spread of the Neolithic. And it's that bundle of technologies that seeded what would later become

41:41.040 --> 41:52.080
the civilizations in southern Iran, in the Indus Valley, so Indus Valley civilization. And I imagine

41:52.080 --> 41:57.040
that, I mean, they were all in contact, there was trade between the Indus Valley civilization

41:57.040 --> 42:04.720
and Egypt via, you know, Fertile Crescent intermediaries. But ideas spread during that whole

42:04.720 --> 42:12.640
preceding arc of civilization. So it may be then that what we see coming out of Upanishadic

42:12.640 --> 42:20.960
philosophy is really a resurgence of older Indus Valley traditions, not that all of them, all of

42:20.960 --> 42:28.720
the beliefs of Vedanta come out of that. Obviously, the rest of the Vedas are still significant, the

42:28.720 --> 42:38.160
ritual forms, the ideas contained in the older sections of the four Vedas matter religiously to

42:38.160 --> 42:45.760
Hindus. But some of these ideas, like maybe reincarnation, although there are some Indo-European

42:45.760 --> 42:52.960
precedents, it's far from a settled matter. But yoga, for example, I would say very likely comes

42:52.960 --> 42:57.520
from the Indus Valley civilization complex rather than an Indo-European innovation.

42:58.560 --> 43:05.200
So maybe some of what we see in Plato that looks Indian, I mean, that's what I recognize,

43:05.200 --> 43:09.200
that's why I was able to understand Plato as well as I was when I first read it. You know,

43:09.200 --> 43:13.760
I got into the Neoplatonist later, I read Plato directly, and I saw it basically through a lens

43:13.760 --> 43:18.480
of Vedanta, and it made sense through that lens fairly easily. Like a lot of the ideas are the

43:18.480 --> 43:23.280
same up to and including the tripartite soul, you have basically, you know, intellect,

43:24.000 --> 43:30.640
thumos, epithumia, or appetite, which equates to Satva, Rajas, and Thomas in Hinduism.

43:31.760 --> 43:39.120
So anyway, some of this stuff that looks Indian might just be the ancient Bronze Age layer

43:39.120 --> 43:46.800
that Plato and Pythagoras got from Egypt, from the Chaldeans, you know, the Syrians basically.

43:47.600 --> 43:55.120
And there's, you know, one more esoteric aspect here that might be in the background,

43:55.120 --> 43:59.680
which is Plato's idea of Atlantis. And if you look at the beginning of the Neolithic,

44:00.560 --> 44:05.040
I have a four-part series on prehistory, the fourth part deals with, you know,

44:05.040 --> 44:11.200
the emergence of civilization. It's probably the most condensed anthropology lecture you could watch

44:11.200 --> 44:18.160
on that period of time from like 15,000 BC down to 3000 BC. A lot happens, you know, and we're not

44:18.160 --> 44:24.000
sure how these developments take place, or why, and why they're so fast, why they're so concentrated

44:24.000 --> 44:30.080
in one particular region, like how the people who built Gobekli Tapu, for example, learned how to

44:30.080 --> 44:35.120
deal with megaliths overnight, and then they got worse at it, which is not what you would expect,

44:35.120 --> 44:41.200
right, if they just came out of a hunter-gatherer society. So people have often speculated that

44:41.200 --> 44:48.400
there was a more advanced civilization prior to the Younger Dryas, which runs from, you know,

44:48.400 --> 44:58.080
basically 11,000 to 10,000 or 9,500 BC. And that was a kind of mini ice age. So it had been warming up

44:58.640 --> 45:05.920
from 20,000 years ago until, you know, 13,000 years ago. And it's very likely that, you know,

45:05.920 --> 45:10.400
just as with the Holocene warming, we saw the emergence of larger populations, you know,

45:10.400 --> 45:16.000
larger settlements, you had a similar thing happen at the end of the Upper Paleolithic.

45:16.000 --> 45:21.040
And then that was upset by the Younger Dryas very suddenly, you know, in a matter of decades,

45:21.040 --> 45:26.480
the temperature dropped, you know, five, six degrees globally, something really extreme.

45:28.160 --> 45:33.280
And that lines up with the timeframe that Plato actually gives for the myth of Atlantis.

45:35.040 --> 45:39.360
So, I mean, you can make of that what you will. I give credit to those theories of an

45:39.360 --> 45:44.560
advanced ancient civilization, because there are archaeological anomalies that just have

45:44.560 --> 45:49.360
no explanation whatsoever. You can obviously ignore those like the Baalbek,

45:50.000 --> 45:59.120
Megalith, or some of the structures in Egypt that seem to predate other structured people

45:59.120 --> 46:05.040
speculate about a date of the Sphinx being older. You know, I'm not sure about each particular piece

46:05.040 --> 46:10.480
of evidence, but an expert in archaeology, but there are many such sites. There's a Megalith

46:11.200 --> 46:17.040
underwater between Sicily and Italy, I think, and no one knows. It seems to be 13,000 years old,

46:17.040 --> 46:23.200
no one knows who built it or how. Some of these anomalies that point to the possibility of some

46:23.200 --> 46:30.480
advanced culture, we could go further into that obviously, but it's a long digression. But if

46:30.480 --> 46:36.080
there was this ancient high civilization, they just think about what kind of technology they

46:36.080 --> 46:42.160
would have developed. They were different genetically than later peoples. They had higher Neanderthal

46:42.160 --> 46:47.120
admixture, and the structure of the Neanderthal brain was quite different. Their cerebellum was

46:47.120 --> 46:56.240
larger, the human, the Homo sapiens, cerebrum is larger. Neanderthals were very intuitive in

46:56.240 --> 47:02.240
their ways of doing things. The forms of their tools didn't change very much over hundreds of

47:02.240 --> 47:07.120
thousands of years, and yet they were successful. We have a hard time replicating their tools.

47:07.680 --> 47:13.520
It was like they had an extreme ability to get the knack of something. What humans are good at

47:13.520 --> 47:18.880
is innovating and thinking analytically and combining things in different ways, whereas the

47:18.880 --> 47:23.760
Neanderthals kind of felled their channel and their groove and really just settled into it.

47:23.760 --> 47:28.480
So that might have been more like the way of thinking of this ancient high civilization,

47:29.040 --> 47:36.880
and people speculate whether it had something to do with acoustics, the rise of advanced

47:36.880 --> 47:44.160
upper Paleolithic cultures in Europe coincides with the first musical instruments. Many of the

47:44.160 --> 47:51.200
important ritual sites are also coincidentally caves that have great acoustics. So you could

47:51.200 --> 47:57.760
speculate some kind of acoustic-based technology in the upper Paleolithic, culminating in a high

47:57.760 --> 48:03.760
civilization that maybe did have an empire, basically, like Plato says that Atlantis had,

48:03.760 --> 48:09.040
and then it was rapidly destroyed by the onset of the Younger Dryas, which may or may not have been

48:09.040 --> 48:13.360
started by a comet. Right now, the evidence does look like it started with a comet.

48:13.360 --> 48:19.440
So that's the most esoteric side of Platonism, is Platonism through the Pythagoreans that he knew

48:19.440 --> 48:25.040
and through his own travels. He traveled for 10 years after Socrates died. So Plato himself may

48:25.040 --> 48:32.080
have actually made it to India. So there is probably some Indian wisdom in there, some vestigial

48:32.080 --> 48:38.960
bronze age wisdom via the Chaldeans and via the Egyptians, and then perhaps this most ancient layer,

48:40.080 --> 48:43.280
which we can only speculate about, but it is fun to speculate about that.

48:45.120 --> 48:52.880
Yeah, I used to be really into Atlantis archaeology stuff as well. I think the most

48:52.880 --> 49:00.400
interesting angle is there was a guy, Schwaller de Lubitz, who was like an Egyptologist and a mystic.

49:01.280 --> 49:07.520
And he inspired John Anthony West, who's a really good book on Egypt called Serpent in the Sky,

49:07.520 --> 49:13.680
where he gets into like the cosmology of the ancient Egyptians and how that was reflected in

49:15.680 --> 49:24.400
their architecture. But he speculated that, both of them speculated that the Sphinx was like eroded

49:24.400 --> 49:32.800
by water. It's the back when there was rain in the Sahara Desert. The second guy West actually

49:32.800 --> 49:38.000
hired this guy called Robert Schock, who is like a geologist who's an expert in stuff to actually

49:38.000 --> 49:45.040
study the pattern of erosion on the Sphinx. And he did conclude that it was from rainfall,

49:45.040 --> 49:53.280
and he actually ended up dating it to like 9,700 BC, which was the date when Plato gave for

49:54.400 --> 50:00.560
the fall of Atlantis. So yeah, there's a lot of interest in esoteric red pills there.

50:01.120 --> 50:06.880
But yeah, I mean, I guess to get into like the sort of meat and bones of Platonism,

50:08.640 --> 50:13.440
obviously, you know, one thing you've touched on a bit and that people obviously associate most

50:13.440 --> 50:19.920
of Plato is this idea of the forms. Now, just before we get into it, I mean, can you give like a

50:19.920 --> 50:25.120
basic background of why does Plato propose the forms in the first place? And how do they

50:25.840 --> 50:30.800
help him make sense of the world in a way that he thinks other philosophers are missing?

50:33.440 --> 50:41.120
Right. Well, a lot of it is tied to the ethical focus of Socrates, right? I think if you read

50:41.120 --> 50:48.800
Xenophon, Socrates does come across as more of this strictly moral philosopher. Plato maybe puts

50:48.800 --> 50:55.360
a bit more Pythagoreanism into the mouth of Socrates than Socrates actually held to. But

50:55.360 --> 51:01.120
the way we are introduced to the concept of the forms through the dialogues is often Socrates

51:02.000 --> 51:11.680
asking about the nature of something like wisdom, or just virtue in general, and trying to get down

51:11.680 --> 51:20.080
to what actually is this that we're talking about. If there are only particular

51:20.720 --> 51:27.600
virtuous men, but no true virtue, then the idea that there are particular virtuous men becomes

51:27.600 --> 51:34.000
vacuous, right? If you're going to take the existence of good seriously, if there is such a

51:34.000 --> 51:40.240
thing, if there is justice, they have to have some kind of metaphysical status, right? Like,

51:40.240 --> 51:52.080
it's nonsense to ascribe a label to a particular society or man unless that label has a meaning.

51:52.080 --> 52:00.560
Like, what is it ultimately referring to? This gets fleshed out kind of analogically with

52:01.520 --> 52:10.240
math, right? We have to believe that there is some perfect circle, because we never, like,

52:10.240 --> 52:15.600
where do we get the idea of perfect circularity? We can mathematically define it precisely,

52:15.600 --> 52:21.120
up to the point where you get the value of Pi coming out of it, which is irrational and goes on

52:21.120 --> 52:27.840
infinitely. So infinite, potentially infinite specification of this perfect circle. And yet,

52:28.720 --> 52:36.160
we don't see that in the empirical world anywhere. There's just, you know, there's no way of making

52:36.160 --> 52:45.360
sense of the labels that we apply to universal phenomena, moral concepts like justice or courage

52:45.360 --> 52:53.760
or things like that, or mathematical phenomena. So it's really, in the dialogues, it's presented

52:53.760 --> 53:01.040
in terms of, well, we're trying to explain what this thing is that people in common parliaments

53:01.040 --> 53:06.320
are referring to. You can keep it at that level and just say, well, this is the way people use

53:06.320 --> 53:12.640
this word. But if you never trace it back to some universal property or universal characteristic

53:12.640 --> 53:17.760
that all of these particulars actually have, and that universal has an independent ontological

53:17.760 --> 53:24.480
status, then there's no accounting for the similarity of the particulars. Why does the

53:24.480 --> 53:31.280
linguistic reference work? That is what nominalists miss. So, like, the thing is, we don't actually

53:31.280 --> 53:37.600
get great arguments for the theory of forms in many of Plato's dialogues. He leaves it at this

53:37.600 --> 53:45.120
kind of rudimentary stage. And many people would say the reason for that is that Plato reserved

53:46.080 --> 53:53.280
the more Pythagorean doctrines for his inner circle, for the people within the walls of the academy.

53:54.000 --> 54:04.080
And Thomas Taylor, the 18th and 19th century Platonist, wrote a book on Aristotle, where he

54:04.080 --> 54:10.160
basically said that Aristotle, just like Plato, was actually cloaking his real ideas, and that

54:10.160 --> 54:16.800
this was a tradition that went back to the Greek sages, to the Presocratics as well. It was viewed

54:16.800 --> 54:25.360
as taboo, for example, to expose the goings-on of the mystery cults. You couldn't tell people what

54:25.360 --> 54:35.440
happened at the mysteries of Lucis. And so similarly, because the philosophy of the Ionians comes out of

54:35.440 --> 54:40.560
a culture where these mystery schools had this preeminent place, the philosophy was tied with

54:40.560 --> 54:48.160
the doctrines of the mystery schools. And so certain elements of philosophy then were, you know, not

54:48.960 --> 54:53.920
for the masses. They were not for mass consumption, not for the Voipalloi. So, Aristotle cloaked his

54:53.920 --> 55:03.760
ideas through this kind of very dense and hard to parse prose, which is unprecedented in literary

55:03.760 --> 55:08.640
history, like the way that Aristotle wrote is unique. And he didn't just write that way because

55:08.640 --> 55:13.680
he was autistic, although it seems like he probably was, but because he was trying to cloak

55:13.680 --> 55:18.640
the kind of core metaphysical doctrines that he was actually talking around in some way,

55:19.200 --> 55:26.480
according to Thomas Taylor. Plato also cloaked his ideas by putting, you know, some parts of the

55:26.480 --> 55:30.880
core doctrine in one character's mouth, and then another part of the core doctrine in the

55:30.880 --> 55:37.760
mouth of Socrates and leaving the picture incomplete, often ending the dialogue in Aporia.

55:37.760 --> 55:42.960
And so this is a criticism that people will make of the theory of forms is that, well, exactly how

55:42.960 --> 55:50.160
does participation work? You know, what's the dynamic here ultimately? And the answer is it's

55:50.160 --> 55:57.520
actually a very complex technical system that you can abstract out of it. Proclus wrote a commentary

55:57.520 --> 56:03.920
on the Parmenides that spells this out. Nicholas of Cusa said that this was the most important

56:03.920 --> 56:09.280
book in the history of philosophy. Parmenides comment, sorry, Proclus' commentary on the

56:09.280 --> 56:13.360
Parmenides. But then on the other hand, Schopenhauer said it was the most tedious book in the world.

56:13.360 --> 56:21.760
So, you know, take that for what you will. But in this commentary, he, Proclus, spells out that

56:22.320 --> 56:28.960
Parmenides is not, as it first appears, just shooting down Socrates' theory of forms. In the

56:28.960 --> 56:35.920
dialogue, Socrates is young in his early 20s, maybe Zeno is about 40, and then Parmenides is older,

56:35.920 --> 56:42.720
60, 70, or something like that. And Socrates listens to the arguments of Zeno for monism,

56:42.720 --> 56:48.640
basically. Zeno argues against multiplicity. Parmenides argues for unity. It's two sides of

56:48.640 --> 56:54.160
the same coin, and they represent the same basic philosophy, which is an offshoot of Pythagoreanism

56:54.160 --> 57:00.320
itself. And so if you read the Parmenides, which is very difficult to read, it's not

57:00.960 --> 57:04.800
like the other dialogues in a lot of ways. The beginning is easy enough, and then it gets into

57:04.800 --> 57:12.320
these long chains where Parmenides is meant to explicate the dialectical method. And it proceeds

57:12.320 --> 57:17.680
in a kind of mathematical way where you look at the kind of hypothesis, and then it's opposite,

57:17.680 --> 57:23.520
and then another set of opposites. And so you just get very lost in all of these considerations,

57:23.520 --> 57:29.120
like if there is no one, then there is the very high level of abstraction the whole time. So it's

57:29.120 --> 57:34.320
like, I read it the first time before I had read Proclas, and I basically just gave up trying to

57:34.320 --> 57:39.920
understand it about halfway through. I think anyone who's honest with themselves will say-

57:39.920 --> 57:42.720
Yeah, me too. I never finished Parmenides.

57:42.720 --> 57:49.040
No. Yeah, it's a different kind of thing. Well, Proclas makes it clearer. And so at face value,

57:49.040 --> 57:53.760
it seems like Parmenides is shooting down Socrates' theory, but what he's actually doing is pointing

57:53.760 --> 57:58.800
out that Socrates needs to introduce certain kind of fine distinctions, subtle distinctions in

57:58.800 --> 58:06.800
theory of forms to make them work. And the core doctrine that Proclas argues for in his commentary

58:06.800 --> 58:13.040
is the idea that there is the the unitive and imperticipable aspect of the form where they

58:13.040 --> 58:18.880
exist in themselves in the same way that like, you know, in physics, the Schrödinger equation,

58:18.880 --> 58:25.440
the universal wave function kind of has its own form and existence eternally. It's a standing wave

58:26.880 --> 58:34.320
and particular things relate to it, relativistically, but it is this permanent reality. Well, the forms

58:34.320 --> 58:40.720
have to have an element like that. It's not that the forms extend like the analogy that Socrates

58:40.720 --> 58:45.600
ends up using is actually, I think Parmenides provides it for Socrates in the dialogue, but is

58:45.600 --> 58:52.800
like, okay, so the form of justice is like a sail, you know, a big piece of cloth that spreads over

58:52.800 --> 58:57.280
many particular men and touches them all. And Socrates is like, yeah, I guess it's something

58:57.280 --> 59:03.840
like that. But that doesn't work because it doesn't preserve the unity of this one thing

59:03.840 --> 59:09.600
that you're referring to, because obviously, the entire cloth has extension. So like, if the forms

59:09.600 --> 59:16.960
are only in particulars, that, you know, looks like Aristotle's hyalomorphism, then how it doesn't

59:16.960 --> 59:23.360
actually get you any closer to explaining this unitary characteristic that is seen in the multiplicity.

59:23.360 --> 59:28.400
That's the basic problem of the forms. How do you account for the similarity, the oneness

59:28.400 --> 59:33.200
in multiplicity? There has to be an element of the forms that is unitive, that is exempt,

59:33.200 --> 59:37.280
and for Plato, that does basically exist in a kind of realm independent of this realm.

59:38.640 --> 59:43.920
And this realm is dependent on it. And so it's not exactly that there's like a separate realm

59:43.920 --> 59:48.400
of forms, and then this realm, it's rather that this realm is an outgrowth of the realm of forms.

59:50.000 --> 59:55.680
And so there's a prior ontological status to these universals in the same way that there's a

59:55.680 --> 01:00:01.600
prior ontological status to the Schrodinger equation, or whatever medium it describes,

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:07.520
right? The ether is older than any particular configuration of matter, let's say. Another

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:13.760
analogy might be like in chess, you know, a particular position on the board, when like

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:20.000
Nakamura and Carlson are playing, hasn't been reached before, it's still real, but it's not

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.640
as essential to chess as like the way that the knight moves, or the number of squares on the board.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:32.960
Those more fundamental, more syntactic, more internal features of chess have a prior ontological

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:41.040
reality. The particular position reached in Nakamura v. Carlson is dependent on the way

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.520
that the knight moves, and the number of squares, and stuff like that. So you have to have this

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:52.400
prior ontological status to general syntactic features of reality. Otherwise, good luck trying

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:58.800
to explain how similarity works, how the laws of physics work, where they subsist, why math

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:04.160
describes the world. It's just like there's really no coherent rational picture you can

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:10.240
make unless you take this leap of saying, yes, there is an independent ontological status to

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:16.720
these universal characteristics, which we describe and indicate in particulars in the world.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:24.000
All right, so if I just like play the nominalist for a minute, I mean,

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:32.160
you could say why do the forms have to exist outside of our sort of shared abstraction?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.120
Well, the question is, why did we come to that shared abstraction? The question is,

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:44.720
why does the abstraction work? It seems like nominalists always just ignore that question,

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:52.880
like it doesn't get you any closer. Well, in the case of, like I said, we look at the form of

01:01:52.880 --> 01:02:00.320
hoarseness. Perhaps they would argue that with what we know about evolution, species are much more

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:05.520
in flux, so we might recognize, and there's kind of intermediary species, and there isn't really

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:13.680
a final end for species. There isn't a final hoarseness. So we're seeing many particular

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:20.480
instances of horses, but what would a perfect horse be in that scenario? You could say like the

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:25.760
most adaptive horse, but then that's like different, you could say for each horse dependent on like

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:35.440
their geographical location or something. Yeah, well, that kind of raises the question of whether

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:45.520
this system, this evolutionary context, had from the outset certain states, certain stable states

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:51.680
that it could reach, right? If you're tied to like an a theory of time, if you're tied to like the

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:57.840
world just is what's happening right now, and there's no eternal reality whatsoever, then you

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:04.720
can try to skirt this question. But you'll be, if you try to do that, you'll be left with no theory

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:11.040
of counterfactuals. David Lewis, contemporary philosopher, put forward the theory of modal

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:17.680
realism to account for the truth status of counterfactual propositions. Statements like if

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:24.320
Johnny had made the last basket, his team would have won the game, that can be true, like we can

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.920
all recognize that that's true, but what is the referent? What is it that makes that statement

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:36.000
true if there's no counterfactual thing that is being referred to? So Lewis just bites the bullet

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.040
and like accepts the, yeah, these other worlds are out there. But anyway, what that allows you to do

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:47.120
then in terms of identifying species is say that, okay, there is this evolutionary matrix, there's

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.000
certain patterns of behavior that themselves have a universal reality, like evolution itself

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.200
is a universal phenomenon. Okay, now where's that in the nominalist picture? Like again,

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.640
any time you try to justify nominalism, you're going to have to fall back on

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:06.480
some realist concept to ground it, because pure nominalism just dissolves into nonsense,

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:12.000
because there can't be any like true reference ultimately, because things are changing too much.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:19.520
But anyway, you can say that there is a stable state within an evolutionary system by comparing

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:26.320
all of the possible paths of evolution. And then you can describe basically as we do in quantum

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:33.920
mechanics, a wave function that has the kind of probability of this stable outcome, which will

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:40.480
have a particular center, there will be an archetypal member of the species that like most closely

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:47.680
approximates that stable state that can find that stable solution, you know, evolution,

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:53.760
it's their objective features that allow you to either succeed or fail. And you have those

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.720
features or not. And they are there are a set of features that for a given environment are that

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:05.840
most stable position. And we do see in evolutionary systems, not this gradual transformation between

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:14.400
infinite intermediary forms. Instead, we see people and species locking into these stable types,

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:21.840
archetypes that work, you know, geometrically, in terms of blood flow, like their physical

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:30.400
constraints that define a range of variables. And there are stable, you know, values for that

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:35.920
those sets of variables and unstable values. And again, across the spectrum of all possible worlds

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.400
in which this evolutionary context happens, you can draw that kind of probability distribution,

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:46.400
which will have a center on one ideal, most stable structure.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:55.120
All right, as far as let's say as far as it's applied to morality, like the

01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:03.200
you're talking about justice. So, you know, perhaps the modern nominalist would would say that

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:09.760
your argument is kind of similar to the nature in one earlier, and that you're kind of pleading

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:16.000
that well, you know, we need to have an objective morality, like it would be terrible if we didn't.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.680
So, you know, there needs to be some objective form of justice. And then, you know, they could

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:26.720
come in with the evolutionary psychology and that kind of thing and say that these are just

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.640
adaptive behaviors and whatnot. And you're trying to abstract that into something objective.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:42.160
Yeah, right. Well, the Plato is moralizing is very different from deontological moralizing.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:48.720
It's really like a statement of the matter of fact, like the way that Plato disproves

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:55.760
Thrasomachus' claim in the Republic that justice does not always align with individual advantage

01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.160
that actually sometimes like its base to be just because you're just following basically

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.200
falling for the slave morality of your time instead of like transcending and looking after

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:12.640
your own individual benefit. But so you get down to an analysis of what exactly is meant

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:20.640
by advantage, what is meant by the good of a particular actor. And the so an issue with

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:26.720
platonic definitions, because he presumes there is this realm of stable archetypes out there,

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:33.600
then we should be able to cut up our definitions to correspond to these like consistent features.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:40.960
And justice, for example, he defines in terms of the alignment of the three aspects of the soul

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:49.040
where you are in charge of your lower nature. So platonic reasoning in the dialogues is often

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.440
kind of messy because he's appealing to the particular preconceptions of the people that

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:58.960
he's interacting with. That's like Socrates' Mayutic method. He takes people from where they are,

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:03.920
uses the concessions that they make from their current state of knowledge and then draws them

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:09.360
kind of upward from there. And so you don't get these like apodictically certain perfect

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:18.320
demonstrations in the dialogues, more like what Aristotle sometimes aims at. But yeah,

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:26.400
so this definition of justice just eliminates the possibility that you can be benefited while

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:32.480
being unjust. Because like, do you care about your possessions? Do you care about your body? Or

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:38.960
do you care about the state of your soul? All other mental states, whether pleasant or painful,

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:45.360
depend on that configuration of soul in the first place. And if you accept that there is a best

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:52.640
state of soul, to facilitate your own kind of proper enjoyment, which I think everyone accepts,

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:59.840
there's like preferable mental states, preferable ways of thinking that lead to greater happiness,

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:07.600
then justice is going to be the way to attain that unity within yourself. So it's really that

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:14.320
he's giving a theory of what justice is, where these notions come from, because it can't be

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:19.120
convention all the way down, right? It doesn't make sense. Again, going back to like an evolutionary

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:25.920
context, in the set of all possible worlds where societies evolve, there are going to be stable

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:30.960
structures that equate to some underlying feature of the nature of reality, and then there will be

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.320
unstable structures. When evolution gets it right, when social evolution gets it right, and morality

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:43.840
equates to this dharmic structure, which you could say is the kind of archetype standing behind the

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.800
particular instantiation when it gets it right, it's stable. When it gets it wrong, it fails.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:57.920
So justice is a more claim of like a matter of fact, not we should have this, but you won't be

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.600
happy unless you are just, and justice means each part of your soul doing its proper business,

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:10.960
right? So if you don't accept that, then the claim will be that you will just suffer as a result.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.160
It's not that you need this justice, it's that you don't know what advantage actually is, and if

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.480
you studied it methodically, and really evaluated what you mean by what is good for you, like if

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.000
you want to make a consequentialist argument against Platonism and say that it leads to too much

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.640
extraction, and actually it's not going to help your nation. Okay, well, what is going to help

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:34.560
your nation? What is advantageous for your nation? That is a philosophical question that you can either

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:40.000
presume that you already know, or you can investigate it. And if you investigate it, the

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.920
contention would be if you properly investigated it, you would eventually come down to this

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:52.080
Platonic theory of value of the good, of justice, of these particular moral qualities that people

01:10:52.080 --> 01:11:02.560
instantiate. Yeah, I don't really understand the argument that, you know, that evolution

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:08.960
would kind of necessarily, that it would end up aligning our moral sensibilities with,

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.240
you know, what's what's deramik, or what's objectively right?

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:22.400
Right, well, the claim would be that there has to be an equivalence at some level, or correspondence,

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:30.480
let's say, between the features, the objective features of reality, and the states that an

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:38.000
evolutionary system takes up. So if you are not in line with the nature of reality, you're obviously

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.960
going to make mistakes, right, your knowledge will not be well grounded, your behaviors will

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:50.400
not be adaptive, adaptive behaviors will survive in a greater number of contexts overall than

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:56.240
unadaptive behaviors. So it's perhaps, it's not right to say that evolution leads to

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:05.280
moral perfection, or, you know, correct moral behavior all the time. But in order to survive,

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.560
there has to be some correspondence between the way you're behaving and the structure of reality,

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.920
right, your karma, individual conduct is tied to the dharma of your society, which is tied to the

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:23.440
art or underlying nature of physical reality. These have to correspond, right, and particular

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:31.040
evolutionary states will accord with that like proper dharma, or they'll deviate from it. And

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:36.560
the claim is, if you deviate from that proper dharma, from that like stable evolutionary condition,

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:43.920
then you're going to be selected out eventually. Yeah, I just don't see how that leads to

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:52.800
an argument for, like, an objective justice and morality within that, because, you know,

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:58.480
why can't it just be like adaptive behavior all the way down, right? Why does there have to be

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:03.520
any objective content to, you know, the good behavior that results from that?

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:11.360
Well, what's objective in it has to do, again, with that structure of underlying reality.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:18.960
So because there are only so many viable states, an evolutionary system can take up

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:28.320
and survive, that constrains the range of what is going to be considered adaptive.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:36.880
That what is adaptive is tied to the nature of reality at base. Now, you know, couldn't it be

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:43.200
that what led to thriving, what led to survival of evolutionary systems had no moral content?

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.760
Well, the definition of morality we're coming up with here has to do with

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.320
advantage, not evolutionary advantage, primarily. I mean, primarily, we're looking at

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:57.920
individual experience. And when we talk about the benefit of individuals, it's in phenomenological

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:04.160
terms, whereas in populations, we're talking about the benefit in genetic terms, you know. So

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:09.680
it's kind of taking it out of its proper context. But we're saying, like, the claim is that what is

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:17.200
adaptive is simply what's right. At the level of evolutionary systems, that applies, like,

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.080
the proper Dharma is going to lead to flourishing of your community. And there is a proper Dharma,

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.280
there is a way of doing that. So that's objective. Right. And then also at the level of the individual,

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.600
if you think that you can reject the platonic concept of justice, and you can,

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:37.280
and temperance, and you can let appetite run out of hand, and not rein it in with reason,

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.920
and that'll be successful. Platonists would just say, no, you're just wrong. You're not going to

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:48.800
be successful if you do that. So morality is, like, tied to advantage. That's the step that

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:54.000
Socrates takes in reasoning in a few different dialogues, including the Alcibiades, which my

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.880
reading group just went through. Does that make it any clearer? I mean, to work out the apparent...

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:05.760
Well, it's just as soon as you tell it to what's adaptive, can't you just get really

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:12.640
consequentialist about that? And, you know, maybe torturing babies from the other tribe

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:19.440
is most adaptive for our immediate benefit, right? I mean, it just seems like as soon as you tie,

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:26.960
as soon as you try and tie an objective good to what's adaptive, it just seems like, you know,

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.360
everything is in flux at that point. Yeah, if you kept, that's why I mentioned this kind of

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:37.920
distinction between evolutionary benefit, which is itself based on abstractions, like the gene

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:44.000
itself is an abstraction. There's no single material entity that equates to a gene. The gene

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:51.360
is defined differently depending on the context in evolutionary biology. So genes are an abstraction

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:57.520
already. And the kind of evolutionary context is within a set of mental parameters of human

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:03.680
theory, right? The reality is more well integrated than that, right? The individual morality component,

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:10.080
the well-being of the soul of the creatures in these populations also factors into adaptivity.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:17.680
So our reductionistic material description of what is adaptive is incomplete. And like, you

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.880
can't just think of morality in terms of evolutionary benefit. You also have to integrate it with the

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:30.720
well-being of the individual soul. And I think what gets the, like, what is objective there,

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:35.760
and not just hedonism, is where you get into this idea of the independence of the soul,

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:41.200
making arguments for the fact that the human being is not the body. The human being isn't even the

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:47.920
combination of the soul and the body. The human being uses the body to do his work. We could run

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.080
through different thought experiments. We can demonstrate that. Plato has several arguments,

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:56.800
but once you accept that the human being is the soul, and if you accept that the soul is

01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:00.880
immortal, which many people don't today, right? Because they haven't really dealt with this

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.800
concept sufficiently, in my opinion. You know, I have my own arguments that I've developed. Plato

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:14.480
has arguments. But once you take that step, then the consequences go beyond just an individual

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:22.880
life filled with hedonic experiences. It goes into the structure of the soul that you are

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:30.160
building through your action. And I think just empirically, that comes across in what makes

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:35.520
people successful. Like, people who simply pursue immediate pleasure, if that's our concept of

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:42.320
advantage here, are generally less happy on the whole than the people who structure their psyches,

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:49.280
who like, do hard work to enforce justice in their own soul. Those people, whatever happens,

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:55.840
they will be more resilient. Because the way that you experience whatever happens in the

01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:00.960
mundane world is filtered through the structure of your psyche. And so if you can build a positive

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:06.640
structure into yourself, align the structure of your mind with the structure of reality,

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:12.480
like through this logistic on through like logos guiding the rest of your activities,

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.000
then you'll just be more content overall. It doesn't have this kind of ultimate moral force

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.200
unless you speculate about consequences after death. And that's why like, all of these facets

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:32.640
have to be combined in order to make sense of Plato's equivocation between advantage and justice.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:38.720
So basically, when people make the claim that in any particular case, what is really just differs

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:44.080
from what is really advantageous, that's evidence for Plato that you just don't actually understand

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:52.320
what justice really is or what advantage really is. Right. So there's, there's no like,

01:18:53.120 --> 01:19:00.320
Kantian idea that, you know, there's no like contrast between doing what's right and doing

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.800
what's good for yourself. In a way, like you're always kind of pursuing your own good when you

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:11.680
pursue the good. But so just back to the idea of the forms, right. So the way you were kind of

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:17.200
speaking about the merrier and when you kind of contrast it with Aristotle. So it sounds like

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.760
you do have kind of a view of like, so there's like, there's, you know, there's different

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:26.480
interpretations of Plato, but there's a kind of two worlds interpretation of Plato that the forms

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:34.960
exist in like another realm, so to speak. The book I'm reading currently is a book called

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.520
Thinking Bean by Eric Pearl. You actually passed me on the recommendation from someone else,

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.400
but he basically totally rejects this and says that this is a bad reading of Plato.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:49.920
And that in a way, like the way we commonly interpret Aristotle, he kind of attributes

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.600
that to Plato and he says that Plato and Aristotle didn't really disagree at all on the nature of

01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:00.400
the forms. And then this passed on to Plotinus and Thomas Aquinas. He says there's like a

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:05.360
kind of a straight thread the whole way through. But it's sort of like the way you were talking

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:12.160
about the forms that you do accept more of like a sort of two worlds interpretation. So like,

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:17.280
what is the nature of the forms? Are they on kind of a higher level of reality?

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.040
Yeah, I would say they are on a higher level of reality, but it's not two separate worlds. It's

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:31.200
more like the world branches from a root in the one, and then through the highest level

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:38.400
categories and forms and the gods also and Plotinism, and then through specific differentiated

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:44.640
structures. I would say if you're going to have a rational model of the world, it's going to have

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:52.000
to look something like this with unity at the top to explain generic similarity of higher level

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:59.360
features of reality, and then descending through particulars to more contingent, less ontologically

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:07.040
fundamental aspects of the world. So our world here is less fundamental than those highest level

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:13.680
features of the world. I mean, any particular state of a system is less ontologically fundamental

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:19.280
than the syntactic arrangement of that system itself, the laws of the syntactic medium. That

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:25.520
has to be prior. Particular states of any system are inconceivable unless there's some kind of

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:35.120
previous order to the syntactic medium in which those states subsist. So it's not exactly there's

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:41.920
two separate worlds. It's that there is, I mean, ultimately kind of one fundamental reality,

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:48.960
the one contains the rest of being and the separation and distinctions that we observe

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:55.440
are perspectives on that being and don't have a kind of fundamental independent ontological

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:02.240
existence. You know, our perceptions now aren't fundamentally grounded in the way that the one

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:11.040
is. Like obviously, it's inevitable that we exist, we are here, but are in order for our being to be

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:16.560
there higher level features have to be the laws of physics have to be there. You know, other features

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:22.080
of the world, the nature of soul in general has to be there, like a particular soul can't exist

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:28.320
unless the structure of reality is such that this nature of soul does actually subsist in some way.

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.000
Otherwise, what is that soul that we're talking about the ontology will have the only alternative

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:40.240
is to make a totally bottom up ontology. And then once you take that step higher level theorizing

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:47.760
really just becomes impossible. And it's not that like I rule out on foundationalist grounds,

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.480
that kind of inductivist bottom up approach, it's that it's never been demonstrated to build a

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:58.160
comprehensive model and Platonism has, you know, like Plato, for example, said the world may be

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:06.080
in the shape of a dodecahedron. And, you know, in 2003, French team, analyzing, you know,

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:11.040
the background microwave radiation imaging said that, you know, you can make sense of

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:15.840
certain patterns in the background radiation by saying that the universe actually has the shape

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:22.960
of a dodecahedron, or like the idea of the platonic solids providing a groundwork for the

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:29.280
five elements in the Temaeus, you know, the tetrahedron being equivalent to fire and so forth.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:37.760
Well, the platonic solids do come up in particle physics, because that is the only possible shapes

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:44.000
for the wave function of electrons in their orbits, for the wave function to kind of wrap

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:50.480
around nucleus of an atom in three dimensions, the only possible shapes that can equate to the

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:57.120
peaks of the wave functions have to be the vertices of platonic solids. And so like this method of,

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:03.520
you know, assuming real ontological status to these higher things allows you to build a rational

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:08.640
system with explanatory power. It has like, it worked for live nets, it worked for people who

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:16.080
have done serious work. And this, the alternative, a totally flux based bottom up irrationalism,

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:22.640
whatever, can't do that. Nobody's ever done, nobody's ever built the complete system without it.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.800
And you can reject it on pragmatic grounds alone by saying, okay, well, what are you going to build

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:32.160
with it, man? Like, you have to build a complete theory in order to compete in this world, not to

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:37.680
bring it all down to the pragmatic justification. But what's that? Did I answer your question or?

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:46.480
Yeah, so, so my understanding of the forms is that, you know, in Platonism and Aristotelianism,

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:52.320
the certain point is that being is intelligible. And so there's, there's no,

01:24:53.280 --> 01:25:00.640
you know, there's no like ultimate duality between subject and object and, you know,

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:09.280
knowledge in the world. So the forms basically are the intelligible aspect of reality. And so

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:19.280
they're more real than sensible objects. So sensible objects aren't a lesser copy of an invisible world.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.680
But it's basically like degrees of reality, going from absolutely nothing

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:33.920
to pure ideas, which is, yeah. Yeah, am I am I getting that right so far?

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:39.120
Yeah, I think probably a part of it is the language that the Greeks used for these different concepts,

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:44.800
like all elements of the spectrum have reality. There's I mean, reality is kind of like a binary

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.640
thing. It's either real or not. So degrees of reality doesn't make a lot of sense. But degrees

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:57.520
of essence does make sense, right? And essence is the word Usia in Greek that is often translated as

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:03.280
being misleadingly in English. And so this leads people to thinking that there's only one, you

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:09.200
know, real being. And this is all just fake, like the world's fake, then that's not what it means.

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:14.800
It's that the realities here are contingent on higher realities, they don't have self-subsisting

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:22.640
essences, which is the definition of a new sea, right? So yeah, in essence is one example of this

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:30.880
kind of metaphysical framework that the Platonists generated that can be helpful in thinking about

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:36.240
these things, just like Aristotle's category categories are helpful for thinking about metaphysics.

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.160
And also if people think that, you know, you don't have to replay them, you can't like evaluate,

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:45.920
you can't, or rather you can evaluate this stuff based on a couple of people talking about it.

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:51.040
It's ridiculous. Do your dang homework and go and like learn the foundations of Western philosophy,

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.840
because you can't cram it in there and then like think you're going to understand it.

01:26:53.840 --> 01:27:00.320
But this system was built out of metaphysical distinctions. So you have energy or energy

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:06.240
equated to activity, which is dependent on essence. So that's one kind of metaphysical

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:11.360
relationship of contingency there. And essence is associated with particular energies.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:18.000
And then the energies of that being, you could break down into the different powers of

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:26.000
capacity and actual behavior. And then above the essence of a thing, there is its hypothesis,

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.320
the summit of its essence, which is the kind of existence, qua existence of that thing.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:39.200
And these words have meaning, these Greek terms actually do make sense in terms of like just

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:45.120
the way that Aristotle's categories make sense of things. So it helps you make sense and it allows

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:49.360
you to build up this comprehensive system. So you, I mean, it kind of makes sense that if you're

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:54.080
going to be a Platonist, you have to take these terms seriously and really investigate what they

01:27:54.080 --> 01:28:00.640
truly mean. So the idea of an essence or an Ussia is tied to the idea of a definition, right?

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:05.920
So that's why in in Platonism, you'll often hear the idea of something beyond being, right? The

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:11.840
Henads, the gods or the one itself is beyond being. What does that mean? Well, they're beyond essence.

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:16.880
So it's misleadingly translated into English as being, but it really means Ussia or essence,

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:23.440
which has to do with like defining features of that thing. And it's not only defining features,

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:30.400
but a set of defining features that is self-consistent and kind of self-grounding in a way, similar to

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:37.040
the idea of an integrated information theory in, well, IIT, which is a modern theory of mind.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:41.120
I think it's basically the leading theory of consciousness out there. It's the one I subscribe

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:50.160
to. And you can basically equivocate between an IIT and an Ussia. So it's a particular kind of

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:56.880
structure that has ontological self subsistence. That's what a soul is. That's what forms have.

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:03.280
And then beneath the level of soul, material things aren't IITs. They're not integrated

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:08.000
information systems. They're incomplete and they're ontologically contingent on more fundamental

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:14.960
realities. Those more fundamental realities being souls and then intellects slash forms and the one

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:22.960
itself above it all. Yeah. So in this book, I'm reading Think and Beans. So he says that

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:29.040
he thinks forms has kind of been badly translated. And he says that the ways used

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:39.760
in the original Greek is very similar to a word like appearance. And that basically he's getting

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:48.080
the forms there. He says that this word is used a lot in Aristotle and Plato, like the

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:59.440
wattness of sensible things. So sensible objects are appearances. But it's like the reflection

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:06.320
of Socrates. In a sense, you would say that is Socrates. But it's like a lesser reality

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:13.280
than Socrates himself. And so as you move up levels of reality, you could go from like

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:22.000
inorganic objects to creatures that have a consciousness, that have

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:31.280
a level of intellect. And then you could go to humans that can think more abstractly. And so

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:39.840
the hierarchy that presents itself in being is going to more intelligible forms of being.

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:45.200
Basically, his argument is that the whole of classical philosophy,

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:53.040
the basis for metaphysics at a certain point is to be intelligible and that there's no

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:59.280
distinction between mind and reality. And so you don't get something like idealism or

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:07.440
materialism. Because being is just that which appears in awareness, it appears in thoughts.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:15.280
So it's always an intelligible reality. It's always rational. And thinking is always thinking

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:22.160
of being. He actually thinks that phenomenology lines up quite well with classical philosophy

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:29.920
actually. But what I find interesting about it is, he basically says that this is what you

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:35.680
need to understand as the whole basis for classical philosophy, Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Aquinas,

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:40.000
that the whole basis for it is this idea that to be is to be intelligible,

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:45.840
that there's no distinction between subject and object. So basically, he would place the beginning

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:53.760
of modern nihilism at the rejection of this idea. And he says that it's one or the other. Either

01:31:54.480 --> 01:32:01.280
being is intelligible and to be is to be intelligible, or else you can't do metaphysics

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:06.640
and you just have to be a skeptic and ultimately a nihilist. So he says the basis for nihilism

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:11.760
is rejecting that certain point of to be is to be intelligible. So that's a very,

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:16.320
you know, that's something I guess discussed a lot as well is like, what's the, you know,

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:19.600
where did it all go wrong in the West kind of thing, these kinds of discussions of like,

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:25.120
well, when did nihilism sit in, you know, was it Christianity? Was it Plato himself?

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:32.240
Was it scientific revolution? And you kind of to very different perspectives when it comes

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:36.880
to Platonism, because so in the case of Eric Pearl, who obviously respects Plato, he'd say that

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:43.440
and that losing that starting point of the harmony between thinking and being

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:48.800
that that gives you nihilism, because then you've no basis for any metaphysics or any objective

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:55.840
claims. And the post liberal theologians who get discussed in these circles sometimes would say

01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:02.240
that, you know, with dynamicalism crisis, where we lost the sense of, we lost the belief in

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:08.560
universals that once we abandoned that, that God became this kind of arbitrary thing, you know,

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:13.840
you didn't really need God, because a lot of the justifications of classical metaphysics disappeared.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:19.600
And the idea that there was an objective good, you know, the good just became like completely

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:25.600
contingent on God's will. But then it's like, when when you adopt that worldview, you kind of,

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:31.040
you're kind of already adopting, you know, 90% of what is like a modern sort of

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:36.880
relative worldview, but you just still have this entity of God, who has kind of an arbitrary

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:43.200
will. And it's like, at a certain point, you know, you've no need of that extra hypothesis.

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:48.560
So the post liberal sort of strand of thought that's quite popular now, especially

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:55.200
among some of the Catholic intellectuals, is that, you know, nominalism, which is the same thing,

01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:00.800
kind of a rejection of Platonism, that that's the root of modern nihilism, and of the modern world.

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:06.880
And then that's, that's completely contrasted with like, these sort of, oh, sorry, I'm getting

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:12.960
a scout call right now. That's completely contrasted with like the Heideggerian view,

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:18.240
which is basically that everything went wrong with Plato. And Plato was the beginning of modern

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:24.960
nihilism. And it was precisely because of this attempt to kind of subdue reality and subject

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:29.760
reality to thought and to reason. And as soon as we started doing that, it kind of, you know,

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:36.080
it was the beginning of this kind of technical way of viewing reality where we try and, you know,

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:41.440
we try and abstract it, we try and bend it to our will. And that we, you know, we should be

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:46.800
approached in being more as a mystery, more as a poet than a philosopher. So you have two like

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:56.240
diametrically opposed views that the problem is that we are presupposing this unity between

01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:04.400
intelligibility and reality versus, if you don't have that, the only option is nihilism.

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.840
So yeah, I'm just kind of spitball now, but I'm just curious what you think of that kind of

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:15.520
debate around the root of nihilism and what you think Platonism can tell us about that.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:24.400
Yeah, I sighed much stronger with the post-liberal theologians and I think the beginnings of

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:30.240
nominalism, you know, like maybe a lot of the client of the West actually can be pinned on

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:35.520
Peter Abelard and the fact that he couldn't like keep it in his pants and then also his disrespect

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:43.680
of existing scholastic methods, you know, is kind of, and I wouldn't say that Peter Abelard

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:50.480
was a full-on nominalist yet, but like I think in his conduct, in his life, you can see just a

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:58.800
discontent, a desire to move beyond the limitations of his time and yeah, this like overwhelming

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:02.320
hubris. So I think a lot of it comes down to moral failures, you know, it's not so much

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:08.400
an intellectual current specifically, it's like there's always been this option available to

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:16.720
people to reject Dharma, reject the law of their society as sacred and inviolable and to try to

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:23.440
kind of cut their own path and use whatever sophistical justifications they can come up with

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:28.400
to that effect. That's the behavior of a lot of the Sophists in the dialogues. So they were,

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:34.080
there was already nihilism, you know, before nominalism and certainly before Plato. So you

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:38.320
can't blame it as a phenomenon entirely on Plato. You also can't blame the rationalism

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:43.680
entirely on Plato. With anything, Plato brought, I mean, Plato wasn't a rationalist. He completed a

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:49.920
rational system that was around in his day and harmonized with it rather than like completely

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:56.160
dismissing it, but then he went beyond it, beyond rationalism to kinds of mysticism,

01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:01.680
including mystic practice that guided the spiritual development of high antiquity,

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:08.880
you know, for 800 years and led to the invention of mathematics, you know, building of

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:14.880
Roman architecture. You don't have the academy and, you know, all this stuff. You don't have

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:19.120
Archimedes. You don't have Roman engineering. You don't have all this beauty that we associated

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:23.520
with the classical world. And Plato is responsible for that. He's not responsible for

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:29.200
rationalism as such. And also, okay, Heidegger, like, what do you want exactly? Do you want us to

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:36.000
see the efficacy of mathematics, see what it can actually do, and then just say,

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:41.760
yeah, but it's a bad idea. Don't mess with it. That seems to be his approach to technology,

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:47.280
generally, but it's like the philosophy of an ostrich, like putting your head in the sand

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:53.280
and thinking that that'll allow you to kind of avoid the structural elements underlying

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:58.560
reality that these rationalistic philosophers are trying to tease out. And certainly, that kind

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:08.240
of rationalistic vein can lead to a feeling of alienation, but only if you hypothesize the wrong

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:14.640
entities in your theories, you know, like materialism, hypothesizing crude matter and putting it as an

01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:20.320
ontological fundamental without even having a good definition of it, like that produces alienation,

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.360
not through rationalism, but from a failure of establishing a well-grounded rational system

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:30.080
philosophy. And I don't know a lot of Platonists who have, like, nihilistic tendencies,

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:37.920
and you can't pin rationalism on Plato. There was already rational philosophy going on

01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:44.320
in the Eliatics with Pythagoreans, with the Ionians. So you can't just put it back in the

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:51.280
bottle either. It's like, this is a mode of human consciousness that had an advantage in its time.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:57.680
You know, the Greeks didn't discover a lot of principles in astronomy, or even, I mean,

01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:02.480
they ended up discovering a lot of principles in geometry, but as of the 6th century BC,

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:08.400
it was mainly the Egyptians responsible for knowledge in geometry, the Phoenicians responsible

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:14.960
for knowledge in astronomy, and the Greeks emulated what they knew, but then found that,

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:21.200
you know, there was no ground for that knowledge. The Egyptians grounded it in, you know, revelations

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:26.160
from Toph, right? The Phoenicians were not sure how they grounded their knowledge in astronomy or

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.480
whatnot, but, you know, it didn't work for the Greeks who didn't believe in the Phoenician gods.

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:38.880
The Greeks, once they received this knowledge, practical, rational demonstrations, or sorry,

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:44.480
rational tools, basically, from the Phoenicians and the Egyptians, they had to ground why they

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:48.880
worked themselves, and they came up with this deductive method, and that's the distinguishing

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:55.120
feature of Greek civilization. They systematized deduction, right? Aristotle gets credit for

01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:02.480
logic, but like dialectics, logic existed prior to Aristotle, and it's what led to what gave the

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:08.240
Greeks their advantage, these new ways of thinking. It led to advantages in law, right? Plato was an

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:13.280
innovator in law, his ancestor Solon was an innovator in law, partly because through their

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:20.880
emphasis on deductive methods and like really analyzing justification in declarative speech,

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:28.240
they just, you know, they moved to a new mode of thought, and it's not fair to pin that on

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:33.920
Plato. Plato tried, once this new mode of thought emerged, he tried to harmonize it, he tried to

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:40.720
put it in its proper context and use it, and like in our position today, you may not like technology,

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:45.440
but if you just become, you know, a hermit in the woods, you're out of the game, you know,

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:52.080
you're not going to do any good for the world just because you have this antipathy to technology,

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:56.720
and that's mainly the way Heidegger seems to talk about it, and I haven't read Heidegger in years,

01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:03.200
but like neither Nietzsche nor Heidegger, in my opinion, offer like a substantive argument

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:08.400
against anything that Plato's saying. At best, you get this kind of, but I don't like it point,

01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:14.640
which is ridiculous, and as far as like modern nihilism, you know, Nietzsche himself is responsible

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:19.120
for a lot of people taking nihilistic turns, but mainly the nihilism in the modern world,

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:26.080
I think. Partly it's nominalism, but partly it's just the failure of Christianity in our

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:32.080
civilization, so we had a metaphysical foundation and it was lost, and now what goes in that hole?

01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:36.320
That's really the sort, that's where you get nihilism. People don't have a groundwork for

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:41.120
morality. I think the average atheist, or just anyone who isn't a Christian, basically in our

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:45.840
societies, if they say they're a moral realist, they probably don't even have very good arguments

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:53.280
for it. You know, you need a system underlying your civilization to make sense of metaphysics,

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:59.120
ethics, epistemology, what grounds claims, like all of this stuff needs to be there to have the

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:06.400
whole moral structure operate, and like we undercut the foundation of our system, of our OS in the

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.280
West, and so of course you're going to get nihilism. Blaming on Plato is just kind of ridiculous.

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:20.640
Yeah, I think the high-deagorean critique could be applied to like Cartesian philosophy

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:28.160
and a lot of modern metaphysics, but yeah, I really don't think it applies to like classical

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:32.480
philosophy or medieval philosophy at all, because you know, that idea that it's like

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:38.800
autonomous reason trying to subdue the world. Well, I mean the, you know, most of classical

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:47.680
philosophy, like Platonism kind of ends up with a kind of apophatic, like ineffable source of

01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:56.080
being, you know, neo-Platonism kind of starts and ends in mysticism. You know, philosophy was

01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:03.600
considered the handmaiden of theology in the Middle Ages. You know, so the idea that like

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:10.640
it's kind of speculative reason trying to present like a perfect sort of rational system of reality,

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:17.280
again, I think that's like maybe a fair criticism of some modern rationalist philosophy, but I think

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:23.040
if you try and put that back onto Plato, I think you kind of missed America. I think you're missing

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:31.200
something that changed, you know, after Descartes and after the Scientific Revolution. So yeah,

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:36.640
I think that misses America. And that's, again, I'd recommend that book by Eric Perlis. It's very

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:41.440
expensive, it's drawn by a hard copy of it, but I'm sure you could find it, but you know, because

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:49.120
he shows how, you know, a lot of these problems that we associate with modern nihilism and with

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:57.040
the way that philosophy kind of lessens the world in terms of, you know, creating dualities like

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:05.040
the mind and the world and subject object and kind of skepticism about epistemology. A lot of this

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:14.400
was kind of solved by the platonic view of the world. And so yeah, the idea that metaphysics kind

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:20.000
of inherently desacralizes the world. I don't think that's true at all. I think Platonism is

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:29.520
is very much a counter to that. Maybe I'll just answer a couple of super chess just so we're not

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:37.840
super pushed for time at the end if I read them. Sorry, one second. Hunter Stern said thoughts on

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:46.960
Hennosis. Unification. Can you explain a bit what Hennosis is? Yeah, so the Hennads are the unities

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:53.200
in, well, I think the distinction is first made explicit in Iambicus, but Proclus makes it a

01:44:53.200 --> 01:45:01.040
complete system. I have to explain a lot of, like, Proclus metaphysics here. I do incidentally have

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:08.080
a roughly four and a half hour video describing every one of the propositions in Proclus'

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:14.800
elements of theology. It's more condensed than reading it itself, but it's a bit tough. I'm

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:19.280
in the process of editing it. But anyway, that might help some people get the full picture if

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:25.280
they can put up with like four and a half hours of, you know, pre-scholastic Neoplatonism. But

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:37.600
the idea for each realm or hypostasis of being, there is the one exemplar of that realm, and then

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:46.720
this exemplar emanates imitations of itself. If it didn't produce the example, like the one itself,

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:52.160
for example, if it didn't give off likenesses, then it would be inert and it wouldn't be as

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:57.280
great as it could otherwise be. And for other arguments, we have to put goodness in the place

01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:03.200
of this kind of ontological first principle. And so in each category, you have like the prime

01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:11.120
intellect, for example. The hypostasis of intellect is also being life intellect. So the prime

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:17.120
intellect is technically being itself, Lucia itself, the archetype of all Lucia. A lot of

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:21.760
technical details in this that I probably don't need to go into. And then soul, there's like one

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:28.400
RK of all souls, the monad of souls, and then a declension through imitation, through likenesses,

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:35.520
moving into greater diversity and lesser powers. So in that first hypostasis of the one, the one

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:41.840
gives off Henads, which are often equated with the Greek gods. And they are super essential. They're

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:48.560
beyond intellectual definition. You know, this Eidos being translated from, or etymologically linked

01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:52.960
to the idea of a look, I think is appropriate. All of this can be interpreted phenomenologically,

01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:59.680
like Eric Pearl does. I think that is totally appropriate. But there's an element of phenomenological

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:05.440
reality that is definitional, well-defined, intellectual, strictly speaking, formal. And

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:11.680
then there's something beyond form, right? Form doesn't make sense unless form is contained

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:18.400
in a transcendental unity. So unity is higher than the application of form. And so we were

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:23.200
received through participation, our particular characteristics from the universals that we're

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:30.400
partaking of at that level. So soul receives from hypostasis of intellect through participation.

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:37.680
We receive unities, our unification of ourselves and unity with others through

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:44.000
genosis, which is a higher energy than the energy of the forms, strictly speaking.

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:49.120
Well, that's something I wanted to ask you, actually, about in terms of what's beyond the form.

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:56.880
So what's the status of the good in Platonism? Is that kind of outside of the forms? I mean,

01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:01.040
that seems like one thing that there's an awful lot of debate about in terms of interpreting

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:05.120
Plato. It seems like there's an awful lot of different interpretations of exactly

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:08.720
what the good is and how it fits into his philosophy.

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:14.640
Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Sucipus, the direct successor to Plato in the Academy,

01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:20.240
seems to, and there are very fragmentary remains of his work, but he seems to have rejected

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:26.480
the Platonic account of the one in the good being the first principle. Aristotle, when he talks about

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:32.480
Plato's hidden doctrines, I think, includes the good and the one in the definition of that kind

01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:39.680
of first principle according to Plato. But I take, and when I read Plato and when I read Proclus,

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:47.680
I mean, it's, Proclus justifies his positions in his commentaries extensively through quotation,

01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:52.800
and I mean, he's pretty compelling making his case that this is actually what Plato thought.

01:48:52.800 --> 01:49:01.280
So I lean towards like the Proclus was right school of Platonic interpretation. So yeah,

01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:06.800
the good is the same with the one. And this is informative for us because we can kind of

01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:14.000
define the nature of goodness through the nature of unification. Anecdotally, it kind of corresponds

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.680
to what we think of as our well-being. Like someone is in a bad state mentally when they're

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:23.440
at odds with themselves, when they have inner conflict, when they're not unified,

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:29.040
cognitive dissonance is uncomfortable, whereas harmony and unification in the mind is positive,

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:34.640
or our bodies suffer pain when they're disconnected. You know, if you tear a ligament,

01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:38.320
it's not a good feeling. If you're more well integrated, you allow yourself to heal,

01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:47.120
then you become more unific and better at the same time. So all union, qua union is a good

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:55.120
because the good and the one are one, in my view, in the way that I see things. But yeah,

01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:59.840
that's above the form. So you have the good and the one, and then peros and apairon,

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:04.640
or the principle of limit and unlimited, which are also super essential. And then you have the

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:11.040
head adds, the species of unity, which are equated to the Greek gods often. And then you have the

01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:16.720
realm of being, life, intellect, the realm of forms in that second hypostasis.

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.680
Okay, what about, you know, we hear about the, you know, the tree transcendental is true beauty

01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:29.920
goodness, but it seems like the good has a, an especially unique place and play those philosophy,

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:35.920
but what about beauty then? So beauty isn't just beauty isn't is the form is that something

01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:43.520
forms as well. I believe. And so part of the system, like the general principle, once you

01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.120
want to accept, there are forms, you have to kind of put them in their proper taxonomy. And

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:51.760
that's a lot of the work that neoplane necessary engaged with. So I can't remember where I read

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:58.880
it, but somebody calls beauty like actually the chief form. I don't know about that. Exactly. I

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.880
don't know precisely where to put this idea of beauty, but it's certainly in the rumble forms.

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:12.000
Okay, that's interesting. Because there's also, I forget that it was at the Tabungan school,

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:18.240
like there's there's this German school of interpretation of Plato that, you know,

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:23.040
to summarize really simply, I guess they, they said that there's like, there was

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:28.720
an unwritten doctrine of Plato that was preserved through some other people and that you can find

01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:33.360
from from oral accounts and so on. And if you put it together, basically, it looks remarkably

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:40.160
similar to what we would call neoplatinism, like platinus. And if they're correct, then, you know,

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:46.880
if you add in like the kind of oral teachings of what how Platinism was taught and the unwritten

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:53.040
doctrines, then there's actually very little difference between Plato and platinus. So yeah,

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:58.160
well, what do you think of that interpretation in terms of what we're missing from the dialogues

01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:04.800
that's kind of necessary to make sense of Plato's metaphysics that was likely there that we've missed?

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:11.680
Yeah, I basically agree with that school of thought. When I read the dialogues before I had

01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:18.160
read neoplatinism, as I said before, I interpreted it in in terms of Advaita Vedanta, and I saw no

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:25.040
real conflict there. So I mean, I do see Plato as a kind of monist, you know, maybe not, you might

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:32.880
say he's like a qualified non-dualist, perhaps rather than like unqualified monism or monism,

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:42.560
whatever. So yeah, platinus, I don't agree with on everything some of his doctrines.

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:49.200
Proclus disagrees with, I tend to side with Proclus on those, like for example,

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:54.720
platinus, when looking for a principle of evil, goes to matter itself. Whereas,

01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:00.800
you know, for Proclus, matter is the lowest entity ontologically, the most contingent,

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:06.480
most dependent entity, least productive itself, but it's not a principle or archaic evil. For

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:13.760
Proclus, there isn't an archaic evil. So platinus can lead to this more like mannequin view in some

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:21.760
ways. So yeah, I mean, I would see platinus more as like an unqualified non-dualist. Proclus and

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:30.000
Plato would be more, you know, qualified non-dualists. But I do see an essential continuity there,

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:35.600
for sure. And again, like people, if you want to argue that Plato wasn't a Pythagorean, it just

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:39.360
seems to me you can't have actually read through the dialogues. Because many of the characters

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:45.040
who are most respected, Parmenides, Zeno influenced by Pythagoras, maybe not technically Pythagoreans

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:51.200
themselves, but Timaeus in the Timaeus is Pythagorean. And then if you look at the roster of the first

01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:56.320
students in Aristotle schools, his school was effectively a Pythagorean school. I think the

01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:02.000
mainstream consensus among scholars is that Plato was a Pythagorean. And there was a Neo-Pythagorean

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.840
tradition that kept running all the way through until the beginning of Neoplatonism. And there's

01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:14.080
also more continuity between Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism, I think, than many people suspect.

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:18.720
It's just that not as many of the writings of the Middle Platonists survive. And I don't,

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:23.040
I haven't gone through all of them, like I need to read Plutarch's Moralia, which isn't all about

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:27.360
morals. A lot of it actually has to do with, like, more Platonic cosmology and metaphysics.

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:33.760
So I'm curious what, you know, I respect Plutarch's sense of style, at least, from his biographies.

01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:40.640
But yeah, he had some Platonic doctrines to relate to his own in his day. So I, yeah, I think an

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:49.920
unbroken line of Pythagorean slash Platonic influence is the way to interpret these philosophies,

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:58.000
their antiquity. Although, yeah, there were innovations in Neoplatonism. But there's so

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:04.800
much in the dialogues that it's often possible to kind of go back and interpret even things that

01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:11.360
seem to be very late additions, you know, like this dichotomy between the one and the hen ads,

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:17.040
but within the first hypostasis, like that's a kind of proto-scholastic fine distinction that

01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:22.640
doesn't seem to be there in Plato. But, you know, if you read carefully enough, like Proclas tends to,

01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:28.080
maybe you can see a justification. So I would say overarching continuity with some development,

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:30.480
especially in late antiquity.

01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:37.360
All right, I want to ask you as well about Plato's conception of God. So obviously,

01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:45.040
in the Tamaeus, he puts forward this idea of a demiurge that created the world according to

01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:52.480
mathematical principles, but it's not the kind of God of classical theism, right? He's a creator

01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:58.160
God, you know, he has a bit more agency. It's not the kind of ultimate transcendent sort of

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:08.160
apophatic being that we might be used to Platonists, you know, how to describe God in theology. So is

01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:14.800
there like two gods in Plato? Is there the demiurge and a more sort of transcendent classical

01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:23.920
conception of God? Or, you know, is the good something that is kind of above God in that sense

01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:28.400
as the ultimate principle? Or, you know, are we to understand that as it relates to like classical

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:37.120
theism? Right, if we're going to go with Proclas again, then there will be a relationship of the

01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:43.600
one and the good to the Greek gods that equates to the relationship between the monad of like,

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:51.040
say, triangularity to all particular triangles. So the monad of Henads is the one itself, and that

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:55.760
because of that, we can call that the first God. Proclas does in the elements of theology,

01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:02.400
call the one itself the first God. So in that way, you could say, I know, Proclas would identify as

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:09.040
a polytheist, but you kind of say there's a cult monotheism there. But anyway, so you have that

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:15.680
kind of divinity beyond participation, pure unity. Like, and things don't directly participate of the

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:22.320
one, they participate via intermediaries, the one remains in itself, never affected by what's

01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:27.680
outside of it, but containing everything outside of it, always from eternity, emanating out copies

01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:33.040
of itself. And then we participate of those unities. Now, the demiurge is at a lower level.

01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:39.680
He's not even the summit of the second hypostasis, which is being as such, the chief among

01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:47.040
intelligibles. And being has to be superior to intellect, because intellect aims at particular

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:53.840
beings. Intellect isn't like, it only makes sense if it has a target. And because something that is

01:57:53.840 --> 01:58:00.080
aimed at a target is subordinate to its end, right, it is trying to get to its end, it can't be the

01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:06.320
ultimate thing. So intellect is not ultimate. In that second hypostasis, being that the principle

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:13.600
being being itself is is preeminent. But so you have the principle being the principle of life,

01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:20.080
and then the principle of intellect. And that that member of this, this set here would be where you

01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:26.640
find the demiurge as such. And his peculiar feature is that he's the intelligible intellect. So

01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:33.840
within intellect, you have a spectrum of the chief intellect, and then subordinate imperfect,

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:39.680
less complete intellects declining from there. In the demiurge himself, his objects of

01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:46.560
intellection, what he's looking at with his intellect is one in the same with his essence.

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:53.680
So he contains all the forms in in himself, all intellects contain all forms, but in different

01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:59.680
ratios. So like the form of, I don't know, say a triangle again, or whatever, will contain in some

01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:05.120
sense, seminally, all the other forms, but it will emphasize the one that is its peculiar identity.

01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:10.560
What's unique about the demiurge is that he contains all the forms unfiltered in himself.

01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:16.080
And his act of creation is also kind of similar to the way that the one creates. He remains in

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:22.400
himself. And through his self contemplation, generates these likenesses that then as intermediaries

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:26.400
kind of do his work. So there's actually not just one demiurge. There's a whole

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:34.160
series of demiurgic intellects, which engage in the fabrication of the world in Platonism,

01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:46.160
or according to Proclus at least. So yeah, it's so in some ways, like the demiurge in Proclus

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:52.720
looks like God in Aristotelianism, you know, for Aristotle, God is thought thinking itself,

01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:59.680
and that is kind of what the demiurge is. It's the prime intellect as such, reverting to itself,

01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:04.560
and intellect is an essentially revered function in each of these, just to kind of

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:10.320
complexify it a little bit more, in each of these hypostases, there is abiding, progressing,

02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:15.840
and reverting necessarily. So each moan out of a series, for example, abides in itself,

02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:21.680
progresses to its last members, and reverts to itself. So intellect in the being life,

02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:27.920
intellect hypostasis is the revered function. Being is abiding, life proceeds, proliferates,

02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:35.120
differentiates, and then intellect in gathers and brings back, you know, what was disseminated.

02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:41.600
So the demiurge is that chief of the revered, revered of function in gathering everything in

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:48.160
the realm of forms, and then through that kind of emanates the lower realms of reality beneath

02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:58.240
himself as his product. Yeah, the, the idea of like, positing two gods or two natures of God is

02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:03.520
actually, you actually see it crop up again and again, like, again, Alfred North Whitehead

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:08.080
theorized that there was like an imminent and a primordial

02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:15.120
nature to God, that there was a, you know, God as he acts in the world, and sort of directs,

02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:22.560
you know, the concrescence of the world versus the God that kind of, because Whitehead kind of

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:27.600
was a Platonist, he's presented as like a process philosopher, but really I see this like updated

02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:31.920
Platonism, but you know, then he had the primordial aspect of God that he needed to pause it to like

02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:38.480
uphold the, what he called them, eternal objects, which are basically his version of

02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:44.880
Platonic forms. But it's kind of, maybe this is, you could tell me if this is a good analogy, but

02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:49.840
you know, in Hinduism and Vedanta, they have the idea that, you know, there's Brahman, which is

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:56.080
obviously the complete ineffable source of everything that, you know, apophatic

02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:03.680
descriptions apply to, but then as it concerns the world, Vedanta actually has like a kind of a

02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:09.520
second God, which is more like the kind of personal, theistic creator God that they call Ishvara,

02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:16.240
and they say that, yeah, that you have to have, you know, that that's basically Brahman's interaction

02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:22.640
with the created world, like somehow generates this like absolute mind. So would you say it's a

02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:29.600
fair analogy that like Demiurge is like Ishvara and Vedanta, and then the Platonic idea of the one

02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:32.800
is, you know, could be equated with like the Hindu idea of Brahman?

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:43.120
Yeah, unqualifiable, yes. Okay, that's interesting. And another thing is, would you say then that the,

02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:51.120
from a Platonic conception of things, does the good have any creative power? Like,

02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:55.760
I know that might sound like a weird question, but I've been, I've been reading this book. It's

02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:00.880
very interesting called Universes by John Leslie. I don't know if you're familiar with it. But he

02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:05.440
basically argues for a modern version of the defined union argument, which I do find very

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:11.200
convincing. You know, just take a modern physics, things like the cosmological constant. And

02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:16.320
you know, I'm sure you're familiar with like the kind of modern updated version of it. But then

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:22.320
at the end, it's kind of interesting. So he's not committed to any religion. But he thinks the

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:28.720
fine tune in argument basically is a convincing argument for God. And it's a much better argument

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.800
to multiple universes. But then at the end, there's an interesting chapter where he's speculating,

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:39.920
well, okay, what, what created this? And he says that he finds the Platonic answer

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:46.480
the best. But the way he presents it is that the universe came into existence because it was an

02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:52.240
ethical good that it would exist. So that's, I mean, that's kind of a, the way we're used to

02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:56.240
thinking in Western philosophy, I think that's kind of a, that kind of hits you as a very left

02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:04.640
of field idea that somehow something being good itself, like gives itself creative power,

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:11.280
like because it was good that the universe would exist. That goodness itself created the universe.

02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:16.720
It's a very strange idea, but he says that this is like a platonic conception of the good. So

02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:19.280
yeah, I'm just curious what you think of that.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:30.480
Hmm. These arguments, like, basically pre Anselm ontological arguments are found in Neoplatonism.

02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:38.080
I don't, I've never really liked ontological arguments. I do side with Schopenhauer on that.

02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:45.120
So it's, it's difficult. You know, in some ways, I'm kind of like getting into Neoplatonism just

02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:48.560
in the last two years. I read Plato, you know, many years ago, I've always considered myself

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:53.680
a Platonist, but I never really took the literature seriously and tell more recently. So I can't,

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:59.600
I can't speak like in specificity on, on precisely that point.

02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:08.800
But I mean, does Plato suggest that the good has some, has some creative power? Like, is it just

02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:14.160
this, you know, because when you think of the good, it's this kind of static, you know, unchanging.

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:18.080
But the idea that it could have like creative power to generate the universe,

02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:22.800
Leslie calls that a Platonic idea. That's a, it's a very different way of thinking about that,

02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:31.360
isn't it? Yeah, I mean, there is, there is talk of like the generation from the one in the good.

02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:38.400
The question is like, how do you justify that argument? Right? One argument that Proclas makes

02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:42.880
is similar to a kind of ontological argument where, you know, once we've identified

02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:49.120
the first principle as the good, and his, I could go through his arguments for why,

02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:55.600
but they're a little bit convoluted. But anyway, once you get that identity of the first principle,

02:05:55.600 --> 02:06:03.760
then okay, what is better, something being inert and static, or something overflowing itself and

02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:08.560
having abundant infinite powers? Well, clearly the latter, right? Appealing toward intuitions.

02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:13.440
So I haven't really seen like an excellent argument on that point. I have my own way of

02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:19.120
thinking about it, which has always been like the kind of ultimately permedean, more this is

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:27.200
where the monism really comes in or monism comes in, where the one is inconceivable unless it subsumes

02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:32.720
the rest of reality anyway. And then the description of reality being emanated out of it is really

02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:40.720
just a factor of like limitations and separations being temporarily imposed through perspectives

02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:45.600
on this one, so that you're never outside of the one, the one has to contain everything.

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:50.320
But in another manner of speaking, we can say it has to overflow itself and create likenesses of

02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:57.600
itself. But like a pure one, a pure simplicity is inconceivable outside of the categorical

02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:02.960
distinctions that we use to arrive at the notion of simplicity, like the simplicity, complexity,

02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:09.760
dichotomy is built into our minds. And so we can't think simplicity without complexity. And so you

02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:15.360
can't put forward a hypothesis of the first principle of being that is this perfect simplicity

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:21.200
with nothing else involved. No matter what, you're always kind of just leaving unspoken the rest of

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:28.560
the categorical schema of like what exactly defines it as simplicity. Pure simplicity is completely

02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:34.880
ineffable, completely unthinkable, and doesn't make sense logically. But if you take this step to

02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:44.320
say that like everything is the same as simplicity at some level, a kind of holographic containment

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:54.160
where complete undifferentiation is always and only at the same time, like all all differentiation

02:07:54.160 --> 02:08:00.160
smushed into one. All differentiation has to be the same as the undifferentiated in a kind of

02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:06.000
paradoxical way. So this is obviously we're dealing with the very summit of, I would say being, but

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:11.600
that's not strictly speaking correct, platonic terms, the highest level of reality. And so in

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:18.080
mystical systems, in perennialist systems, there's always antinomy, seeming paradox, seeming contradiction

02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:25.760
because we've run up against the limits of dynoia, rationalistic thinking. We can't touch that element

02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:32.480
of reality through abstractions because they are inherently categorical, inherently relational.

02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:37.920
And so you can't express simplicity through relation, through a relational medium. The only

02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:43.360
mode of contact would have to be intuitive, which is why like the knowledge of this reality

02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:48.880
can only ever come down to us rationalistic philosophers from those who through through

02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:55.520
theology or yoga or whatever have made contact with that more unitive ineffable aspect of reality.

02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:04.400
So does it make sense to say that? I mean, does it make sense to ask why the forms exist? Like

02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:08.960
is there any level of contingency or are they just absolutely necessary? Because like take

02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:15.200
like modern Christians, right? Like, I think William Land Craig argues that he believes in,

02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:23.520
you know, abstract objects, that numbers exist. But he thinks that it's a itself kind of an

02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:29.040
argument for the existence of God, but he also says that these wouldn't exist without God creating

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:33.920
them, without God creating the laws of logic and numbers and so on, because he says that it's like

02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:39.440
it's a terrible limitation on God if you say that these, you know, numbers and abstract

02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:46.240
objects and stuff are absolutely necessary. Because, you know, that's that's there themselves

02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:53.200
kind of constraining God then. So like what's kind of a standard traditional like plateness

02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:57.680
take on that? Like would Plato have said the, would you have ever speculated about like why

02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:01.600
the forms exist? Or would a plateness say that that's kind of a meaningless question?

02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:10.240
No, I don't think it'd be meaningless. I think they why they exist, you can easily justify on

02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:14.240
epistemological grounds, like theoretically, we have to postulate these entities to make sense

02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:19.920
of what we see. But like the bigger question of why they are there, you have to go to the higher

02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:27.520
principles beyond the forms have to be prolific themselves, or they would be not as good as they

02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:32.640
could otherwise be. So again, it's this kind of variety variation on the ontological argument

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:38.320
that people keep falling back on here, which I'm not totally happy with. But I think one way of

02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:46.240
thinking of it is just that because creation from the one happens through similitude likenesses of

02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:53.120
himself, the forms inevitably reflect the nature of that kind of divine reality in itself. So it's

02:10:53.120 --> 02:11:00.160
not it's not a matter of God kind of with like libertarian free will selecting, you know, how

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:06.720
he's going to make the world. It's rather just the world and the forms are just an overflowing of

02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:13.200
divine power and are an expression of his nature. And so they're not arbitrary. They are the necessary

02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:20.720
ways that being must unfold. And that's like that raises kind of the ultimate metaphysical question

02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:30.720
that you could ask, you know, is ultimate reality necessarily one way? And does some being or

02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:38.960
super essential reality exert some kind of will over what the nature of that possible realm of

02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:45.280
being would be? For me, like, if if that's what you do, then you're nominalist, and ultimately,

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:49.680
like, you're not going to be able to have rationalistic framework, you can always take that

02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:54.480
step theoretically. But the worldview that comes out of that won't have the same advantages that

02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:00.880
a worldview based on necessity has. And, you know, necessity just in Greek mythology, and in most

02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:07.200
traditional mythological systems is placed above the gods. So the way that the forms are the way

02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:12.080
all these subordinate levels are have to just be reflections of the nature of the divine ultimately.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:18.080
All right, I'm going to get to some more to super chats. George Wright said,

02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:22.720
when translated and played with Christianity, does the one correspond to the father and

02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:30.400
Logos, the son? Logos, Jesus is Logos in the Christian interpretation, isn't he?

02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:35.280
Yes. Yes. I don't know about the father as one of you.

02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:45.600
No. I mean, if anything, the father in Judaic theology is more like the Demiurge, yes.

02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:54.720
And Logos, I mean, the Logoi are principles within soul, like Eidos is the formal principle in the

02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:03.120
realm of forms. Logos is, I think, peculiar to the level of soul, but I could be wrong on that.

02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:08.880
It's kind of a technical point. Just actually seen as that came up, the Demiurge, the Old Testament.

02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:15.200
So how influential was Platonism on Gnosticism? Did they get the idea of the Demiurge direct

02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:23.520
from Plato? Yes, for sure. Of course, like the pessimism of the Gnostics, they did not take

02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:28.320
from Plato. Plato was really, I think, more like Leibniz, where Leibniz thought that we have the

02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:34.160
best of all possible worlds, very anti-Schopenhauer in that way, or not in line with Schopenhauer's

02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:39.760
views. But yeah, the world denying isn't really there in Plato. I mean, he acknowledges that

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:44.640
there are better places to go, but he also acknowledges that the world is a beautiful place

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:49.840
and is created by it. Plotinus wrote a big screen against the Gnostics, didn't he? Yeah,

02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:57.680
right, which I haven't read in a long time. But yes, so I do think they got that idea,

02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:04.080
the Gnostics did. Also, it deserves mentioning it's this guy, Russell Gmerkin, has a very

02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:09.440
interesting hypothesis about the origin actually of the Old Testament as we've received it.

02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:14.880
Sorry, what's that name, Russell? Russell Gmerkin, G-M-I-R-K-E-N, I think.

02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:24.080
So apparently, there isn't a shred of archaeological or textual or cultural evidence at all of the

02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:31.280
Old Testament prior to 270 BC. And that's when the Septuagint Bible is translated. The translators

02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:37.040
of the Septuagint Bible were Hellenized Jews living in Alexandria. They translated it in the

02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:42.160
Library of Alexandria where there were obviously tons of Hellenistic texts, including Plato.

02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:50.160
And Gmerkin just kind of traces all of these parallels between conventions in Greek literature,

02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:56.720
Greek legal conventions, like the idea of a constitution is uniquely Greek. The ancient,

02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:01.760
like the Code of Hammurabi is there as a set of laws, but Near Eastern societies didn't invent

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:06.720
the Constitution. And yet there are constitutional elements in the Old Testament and in Greek

02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:13.440
law, and then also like particular prescriptions that Plato offers in the laws, especially in the

02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:23.520
Republic. And it just looks like the people who translated the Sanhedrin Bible were actually

02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:29.840
drawing from a set of their traditional scriptures and put it together in line with Hellenistic

02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:38.640
philosophy and especially the advice of Plato, which if true would be hugely significant. I mean

02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:46.320
obviously, I think Gmerkin has a couple interviews on YouTube and I've read some of his more recent,

02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:50.880
he has two books on this, I read some of the more recent book. And it's definitely an interesting

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:58.640
hypothesis. Well, Nietzsche said Christianity was Platonism for the masses. So if Gmerkin is

02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:05.920
correct, then that was doubly true. Yeah, that's interesting. And then when the Gnostics criticized

02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:11.600
the Christians, or sorry, when the Neoplatonists criticized the Christians for being a historical,

02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:17.600
well actually, it might be because the Jews themselves invented this fake history on the

02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:22.080
advice of Plato, as he says in the Republic, you have to believe that your institutions are ancient,

02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:28.080
etc. And that's what the Jews who followed Plato's advice did. And so that would be like the whole

02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:34.720
Testament, like back to Moses and Abraham. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there would be certain

02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:39.120
scriptures that already existed, like the Book of Job, most people think is actually ancient

02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:45.680
from like 11th century, or sorry, 11th, you know, 11th century BC, or thereabouts,

02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:52.480
there are precedents in Near Eastern literature from the 800s, 700s, the lament literature that

02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:58.240
like the genre looks similar to the Book of Job. But yeah, as far as the system goes that Pentateuch

02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:05.440
the Mosaic Law, all of this stuff, and it fits with the higher criticism, like the author that's

02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:12.320
called like the Deuteronomist, who's the latest author who really puts together like the Deutero

02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:19.520
canonical formalization, and that system of law that would have been under Gomerkin's hypothesis

02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:24.880
created during this translation of the Septuagint around 270 BC.

02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:31.920
Right, that's very interesting. Yeah, I've bookmarked his Wikipedia, so I'll definitely check

02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:38.560
that out. Hunter Stern said thoughts on the Straussian hermeneutic of Plato.

02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:42.160
I don't know Strauss, so.

02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:51.920
Yeah, Strauss has this interpretation that, you know, you have to have like an esoteric

02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:56.240
interpretation of every philosopher, because they have to write in a way that doesn't,

02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:00.720
that Plato came to this realization with Socrates that, you know, you have to present

02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:06.160
version of your philosophy that won't upset the social order, and then one that can be

02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:11.040
read esoterically. But I haven't read a lot of Strauss readers, so I can't really say it that

02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:16.320
much. I mean, I agree with that. There's definitely the esoteric divide and Platonism.

02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:25.120
Yeah, he thinks that's like, he also thinks there's an esoteric message in Plato, like specifically

02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:31.440
about that, you know, as discussions of Socrates and stuff, like the role of the philosopher

02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:39.920
as it pertains to the social order and trying to translate truth in that context. But yeah,

02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:44.640
again, I haven't read a lot of Strauss, I can't really say anything too interesting on it.

02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:53.680
Eton Vac said, Ervol speaks a lot about Platonic metaphysics, forms, etc. Okay, this is quite a

02:18:53.680 --> 02:19:00.000
big question. One, how do you assess Plato's political philosophy strictly? Two, how much is

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:05.680
Plato's political philosophy grounded in his metaphysics? And, well, I guess you can answer

02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:10.640
those first, and then I'll ask the other one, because it's kind of unrelated. Yeah, Plato's

02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:13.840
political philosophy, it's kind of surprising we didn't cover that at all, actually, but

02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:20.240
right. Yeah, there's a relationship known for, yeah. Right, yeah, yeah. So the relation to

02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:24.640
his metaphysics, that's quite an interesting angle as it concerns his philosophy.

02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:31.680
Right, I mean, they're obviously intimately connected. I am a Platonist politically as well,

02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:36.960
and Plato was an authoritarian. Basically, it's one big endorsement of paternalism.

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:43.520
There is a hierarchy of souls, some souls know better. And if you don't know as well as someone

02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:50.400
else, like you should follow the people who know. Everyone's, this is like a proceless idea,

02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:58.080
everything's proper perfection is to be found by following, like in the train of its whatever

02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:03.360
leads back to its proper cause. So the world is filled with these intermediary authorities that

02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:09.840
we always have to be appealing to, to integrate ourselves into a broader hierarchy. And I think

02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:15.920
that's basically the way and the model and the path. And I think in the 21st century,

02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:20.960
especially it's going to become more obvious that you can't have libertarianism culturally.

02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:26.160
You have to have some degree of paternalism. Now, there is a harmony that you can find between

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:31.680
libertarianism and this more authoritarian paternalistic way, which is like, you can have

02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:36.960
independent kind of volunteerist societies that themselves internally operate on authoritarian

02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:43.680
lines. And that's ultimately the way that I go. But yeah, I don't really disagree with Plato at all.

02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:50.240
The Republic is meant to be like an absolute ideal. There's a couple of things we know about the way

02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:55.440
he thought about this ideal state. One is that it corresponds to some kind of ideal form archetype

02:20:55.440 --> 02:21:00.480
of political society that is there to be found by anyone. So Plato wouldn't have thought of himself

02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:09.280
as inventing this system, but rather discovering like the true, most true dharma of a society

02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:17.520
like his own. But then there's also a chart, sorry, just bear with me one moment here.

02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:26.320
Yeah, there. So it's an ideal, it's also in the Timaeus, we learn exactly the constitution

02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:32.960
and structure of ancient Athens. So in the Atlantis narrative, Athens defeats the

02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:40.400
Atlantean Empire. And part of why it's able to do that is because it had this best of all

02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:46.800
possible models of the state handed down directly by Athena. So it's given by the gods. It's also a

02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:52.720
form, perfect mode of government. And, you know, some of the particulars you could argue were

02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:58.880
having to do with the technology of this time and place. But by and large, the process is,

02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:04.800
I think, what needs to be there in political society, which is you need to get talent very early on,

02:22:04.800 --> 02:22:10.640
standardize certain aspects of education, especially like music, gymnastics, mathematics,

02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:16.160
like what we've basically done. Like a lot of philosophy of education over the centuries

02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:24.240
its origin to Plato's philosophy of education, and of Athens more broadly. You know, a lot of what

02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:31.360
Plato recommends in the Republic is just like, do what Athens does and this and this additional

02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:36.800
stuff. So yeah, I mean, I would consider myself a Platonist, basically, and it's tied to the

02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:44.000
metaphysics because that's what the guardians have to do. They have to be able to make contact

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:48.880
once they've studied their mathematics, completed the rationalistic philosophy, learned all the

02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:54.400
mundane principles of government. Then, you know, when they're 55 and up, and they're at the real

02:22:54.400 --> 02:23:00.800
head of the hierarchy, they can like make make that intuitive contact with the forms, you know,

02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:08.160
come to know the perfect state directly, and then come back down into the cave into the political

02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:14.560
society and enforce that. And unless for Plato, you have this caste, spiritually enlightened caste

02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:19.280
that can return to the higher realm in some form and, you know, make contact with that

02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:25.120
guiding principle or formal principle of society, then it'll break down. So they're definitely

02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:33.040
connected. All right, and the second part of that question was just, have you encountered

02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:35.120
tropes nominalism?

02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:46.480
No. Okay, yeah, I'm not very familiar with either. Just one other thing on that actually,

02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:53.440
again, it's quite a big question. But I mean, in terms of the Plato's approach to political

02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:58.320
philosophy versus Aristotle, I mean, what would you say is, is the main difference there? Is it

02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:05.520
that Plato is more focused on, like, the perfect ability of people through the state in a way

02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:11.040
that Aristotle isn't, you know, he's more taken the kind of family is a starting unit, would you

02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:20.000
say that's a fair characterization? Plato certainly has more hope for the perfect ability of man,

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.920
but people mischaracterize that and take it in this kind of communist or like new socialist man

02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:30.320
way in thinking that like everybody's going to be transformed. And Plato knows that's not

02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:35.760
happening. Obviously, this is for the elite. It's for a small segment of the population to

02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:44.640
actually overcome these kind of egoistic limitations of everyday life and and make a difference.

02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:50.400
But anyway, Aristotle, I've read his politics, but I'm trying to kind of remember like where

02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:58.320
where he really situates like the highest form of government. I know he ranks, I mean, his ranking

02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:07.200
is similar to that of Plato from the Republic. But do you recall like does he put aristocracy on top

02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:14.240
still? I don't know that he really like fundamentally disagrees. All that might mean he gets the idea

02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:19.760
like man is a social animal, you need this larger community, but that also it follows

02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:25.440
right in line with what Plato talks about in the Republic. You know, maybe there's

02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:32.480
more emphasis on kinship, but also Plato, like if bare minimum, people need to believe that they all

02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:37.920
spring from the same ground, you know, they do have this blood and soil connection. So that's

02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:43.200
important mythologically for Plato, even if not like if it doesn't always have to be ethnographically

02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:48.880
true, for example, like the Athenian tribes were legal fictions and people more or less knew that.

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:55.600
And yet Plato would endorse such tribal divisions, even if they don't come from an

02:25:55.600 --> 02:26:02.000
organic source, they can still be useful for the state. Yeah, so I don't know, I would have to

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:09.680
reread the politics to really make a robust comparison. All right. Hunter Stern said,

02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:14.480
is there any difference between Dugan and Urban Crystal both have their start in politics with

02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:19.280
their own strand of Bolshevism, then through a schizo hermeneutic of Plato and onto influence

02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:26.800
politics? Well, they're political views are obviously quite a bit different, I would say.

02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:33.040
Sovereign Air said, you don't need to watch a video called the Athenian Revolt Against Babylonian

02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:39.920
Finance. I linked it, I think it's by that channel that used to be around vertical politics.

02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:44.480
Promise you won't be disappointed with the quality. He's one of the best creators,

02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:50.640
not as official channel. All right, well, I'll check that out. But yeah, that's all the superchats.

02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:56.560
Yeah, did you have any other topic regarding Plato you wanted to cover?

02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:06.960
I mean, I think basically, like the challenge for people is if you don't want to accept the theory

02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:13.360
of forms to explain how universals work, then you have a lot of other work to do in really making

02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:19.120
a robust nominalist system. I know that a lot of other professional philosophers are nominalists.

02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:25.040
I just don't think anyone can be a nominalist coherently. That's my case. That's what I defend.

02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:30.880
So a lot of it does come down to the theory of the forms, the idea of universals,

02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:37.280
what is the first principle of being? If it's not unity, if you don't go with Plato there,

02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:41.440
and you don't take that kind of monism, then what's your first principle? The question is like,

02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:47.840
here's this system. It is acted as the foundation of Western philosophy for more than 2000 years.

02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:51.760
People have built off it in thousands of different ways in different ages.

02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:58.480
And so if you're going to just say no to it, okay, man, now it's your turn. Now it's your turn to

02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:03.760
build this system that's going to work for us as a foundation. And I don't see anybody coming up with

02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:09.680
anything like that. If perennialism is essentially true, there is one true philosophy, then you

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:16.080
should expect the majority of the traditions out there will always be guided by a similar kind

02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:24.640
of basic set of beliefs. You see that in Hinduism, in Platonism, you see that hints of it in what we

02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:29.600
can gather of Indo-European philosophy. There are regional differences, of course, but I think

02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:35.120
that the basic truth, metaphysically speaking, of the world is there, and it's one. There is one

02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:41.280
truth of the world. If you say Plato got it wrong, then what do you put in its place? And like a

02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:48.000
reference to its flux or its ineffable or unknowable, that can remain a bare assertion,

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.440
but it doesn't amount to a comprehensive worldview. And there are plenty of scientific

02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:56.400
Platonists who have integrated modern theories, like there are Platonists working today,

02:28:56.400 --> 02:29:00.880
integrating quantum mechanics, integrate information to people like Johanna Rottz,

02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:06.880
who I respect. I know that you know about these people are out there doing the work to build

02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:12.640
the new system that, you know, the equivalent of what Aquinas did in the Middle Ages, the equivalent

02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:21.200
of what Plato and Aristotle did in antiquity. And yeah, there's just literally no alternative.

02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:29.120
So we've just read through the Elcibiades, and I think the basic point that is made there is,

02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:35.440
on the one hand, the nature of the soul. Where is our identity fundamentally situated? Do we

02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:40.400
benefit ourselves by benefiting the body? Do we benefit ourselves by acquiring power? What's that

02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:46.560
kind of first principle? What do you do first? Like even if we agree that political power is good.

02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:51.920
Elcibiades, of course, is Athenian statesman. Bronze Age pervert mentioned him in his book,

02:29:53.440 --> 02:30:01.200
Bronze Age mindset, as this Athenian statesman who like had influence in Athens, and then when

02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:06.160
they were going to arrest him at a certain point in time, defected to Sparta. And then from Sparta,

02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:10.000
well, he impregnated the wife of the king in Sparta. And so he had to leave and he defected to

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:14.400
the Persians. And then from the Persians, he redefected to the Athenians who wanted him back

02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:19.040
because they thought like, wow, based, that's cool. And so he went back and then was kicked out again,

02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:23.920
and then eventually died in Turkey somewhere. So but he was like, you know, very guided by

02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:30.000
Thumos, very like martial spirit kind of character. And he wanted on his like 18th birthday, as soon

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:34.160
as he was given full legal privileges in the state of Athens, he wanted to go into the assembly and

02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:39.200
like tell him what was what and what they ought to be doing with the state. And the whole dialogue

02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:44.400
is Socrates basically just saying, whoa, calm down, like, first of all, what are you advising the

02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:49.200
Athenians on? What do you know better than them that you can inform them on? And these are the

02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:53.040
sorts of questions that I think many people who operate in political spheres don't actually

02:30:53.120 --> 02:31:00.560
fundamentally ask themselves, you know, what do I know better about how the state should be run?

02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:06.000
People presume that they know better, but often they leave these fundamental notions like justice,

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:11.920
like advantage, like what is the soul, like these sorts of things, they leave them completely unanswered.

02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:16.240
And this approach of like starting in the middle with philosophy and starting with common notions

02:31:16.240 --> 02:31:24.080
and indefinable, you know, je ne sais quoi that is your identity and movement. Like, that's not

02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:29.440
been demonstrated to work. Historically, it's this Platonist approach, what Socrates advocates for

02:31:29.440 --> 02:31:36.960
Alcibiades like, no, first, take care of your own virtue, get grounded yourself, and learn the nature

02:31:36.960 --> 02:31:44.320
of reality. And then maybe you'll be in a position to to advise the Athenians and, you know, exert

02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:51.040
your influence on their on the Empire. But step one is like, Okay, prepare yourself. And I think

02:31:51.040 --> 02:31:57.040
Plato's solution ultimately is very clear. It clearly worked. It was building a school. And I

02:31:57.040 --> 02:32:01.760
think we we are in a similar position. We should do similar things. So yeah, I'm doing my reading

02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:09.120
group. We just finished Alcibiades. We're moving on to the Gorgias, starting April 16. We meet on

02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:13.520
Saturdays. People can join through the Patreon by recognizing that not everybody you can

02:32:14.560 --> 02:32:19.840
support it doesn't work for some people situation. So I have made quite a few exceptions for people.

02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:24.480
So basically, whoever wants to get involved, you can contact me on Skype or just join the Patreon,

02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:28.880
and I'll send you a link and explain how it works and stuff. But it's it's kind of just required

02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:37.120
reading. Like if you want to be more than just a commenter on current events, like if you really

02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:41.920
take the truth seriously, you want to have this holistic worldview. And I don't think our side,

02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:46.720
generally speaking, can win unless we have this comprehensive worldview supporting us, like you

02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:51.920
have to at least match the kind of thing the elites have produced. And by the way, the elites got

02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:58.800
way where they are by relying on their knowledge of Plato, they read Plato, you probably should

02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:02.800
do like it's kind of required reading if you want to have this comprehensive worldview, if you want

02:33:02.800 --> 02:33:06.800
to get to the bottom of things, get to the bottom of our civilization, all of this, you're going to

02:33:06.800 --> 02:33:11.120
have to do it one way or another. So you might as well deal with others. The dialogues can be a

02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:16.320
little bit difficult to read. There's often many layers of meaning that get lost. You know, I'm often

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:22.480
kind of blown away by some of the Neoplatonic commentators when they like, excuse me, explicate

02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:27.200
a metaphor that is there in like the setting of a dialogue, for example, and I just had no,

02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:33.600
no cognizance of it the first time reading through. So there's a lot in these texts, you know,

02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:38.720
they not only found provided the foundation of Judaism, Christianity, some of Islam,

02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:45.680
also Hermeticism, ancient occult traditions, Renaissance magics, like all occult traditions

02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:52.960
from Rosicrucianism to Masonry, like Mason still talk about Pythagoras and Plato, the all of these

02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:57.840
people who have controlled the world have built what they've built off of the back of Plato. So

02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:04.160
even if you want to reject it, fine, first read through it. So, you know, I encourage people

02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:09.760
with dissenting opinions also to get in contact with me. If you think I'm totally wrong, then

02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:14.640
let's have a conversation about it, you know, take our time and really analyze what's being said,

02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:20.720
because kind of a motive just reacting against Plato, because like Heidegger doesn't like Plato

02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:27.360
or whatever is just kind of childish, let's grow up and get our foundation set for putting ourselves

02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:35.200
in the best path to victory, ideally. Yeah, your Ereval's channel link is in the description,

02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:40.880
so if you want to get in contact with them, I think you post your Skype and other links and

02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:45.840
stuff in the video so people can find you through there. Actually, one thing, the guy who asked

02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:50.000
about the difference between Irving Crystal and Dugan, there is actually a debate that's been

02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:57.360
done around again lately, where Dugan actually debated Bernard Henri Levy, who has a very similar

02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:04.880
worldview to Irving Crystal, he's like a big apologist for neoliberalism and neo-conservatism,

02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:08.800
so you could just watch that debate if you want to see the differences in worldview.

02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:16.400
But yeah, just one other thing actually, I mean, I know you, as far as, you know, what you mentioned

02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:21.440
about the school and you think that we need to do something similar today in terms of bringing the

02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:30.000
best minds together, creating like a comprehensive, coherent worldview, certain metaphysics that has

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:36.880
like scientific insights. If I understand you right, you think that an advantage of this is

02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:45.600
basically, you know, who kind of wins in the social space is kind of decided by technological,

02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:53.520
scientific advances, you know, that's kind of how liberalism came to power. Like one question I have

02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:58.240
is like, you know, as far as that goes, I mean, if you were to bring kind of the best scientific

02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:05.360
minds together and get a, you know, an excellent sort of theory of everything, isn't there a problem

02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:13.360
in the modern world that like to translate that into power now requires such a massive

02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:20.160
sort of military industrial complex behind you. Like when, you know, the more things progress,

02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:25.440
like, you know, one time you could make a great scientific discovery with a telescope, right,

02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:30.480
or a math equation, but now the way things are progressing, you need like the large hadron

02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:35.760
collider for like billions of dollars, whatever that costs, and like a huge team of hundreds of

02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:41.360
scientists. So I don't know, that's a, that was a question actually in terms of like, you know,

02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:49.040
does having the truth, or does having a scientific insight really translate into power today if you

02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:56.160
don't have a huge state apparatus behind you to create a huge industrial apparatus to, you know,

02:36:56.160 --> 02:37:00.400
carry out experiments and turn that actually into technology that could make any difference.

02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:08.240
Right. Well, on the one hand, it depends on exactly what this new

02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:16.480
philosophy worldview scientific paradigm looks like, because if it allows us to rediscover

02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:22.240
the lost Atlantean acoustic limitation, you know, whatever they were using, then maybe it's something

02:37:22.240 --> 02:37:29.120
that's practical for people. That's obviously a stretch. But I think the more like direct

02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:36.320
path to victory by having an institution like this is using it as a framework for communities

02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:40.160
to build new kinds of production chains. So rather than trying to like build the new

02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:45.280
high tech thing, you have to be vertically integrated and you have to start from the ground up.

02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:50.320
So you get this society together with the right worldview, and then you organize intelligently

02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:56.960
in paternalistic ways, and build out the production chains gradually. So the direct

02:37:56.960 --> 02:38:02.880
application of this worldview is as an operating system for a social structure. And then you scale

02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:09.360
that social structure by better management, by affordability, by offering like tangible material

02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:15.120
benefits to people who joined your paradigm. And then gradually you have more communities

02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:20.400
involved, you have more people cooperating in your system. And then the end product of that

02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:24.880
is some of this more high tech stuff that requires, you know, more capital investment.

02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:29.600
But I think the worldview doesn't, it's not that the direct output has to be

02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:35.120
the side beam cannon, right? That's like, there have to be several steps before you get to that,

02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:42.240
that end artifact. So yeah, if you have the right worldview, you can align values,

02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:50.400
you can get people cooperating, and then simply recruit, scale, and repeat until you have the

02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:58.400
resources you need to do whatever else you want to do. All right. Yeah, well, we're coming up to

02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:02.960
two hours, 40 minutes. Yeah, I really enjoyed this talk. It was great to get you on. Like I said,

02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:09.120
I'm kind of immersed myself in Platonism again. And I feel like, kind of feel like I'm starting

02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:13.920
from scratch, because yeah, if you really get into it, you can realize that there's there's a lot of

02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:19.200
things you kind of took for granted, or you kind of gloss over some of the ancient philosophers,

02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:25.280
I definitely did. You know, you kind of like, well, my experience anyway, no, I found the

02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:30.960
just you feel like you there's like a sort of obligatory, like summary reading of them that

02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:35.600
you have to do. And you just get the basics of them. And that's kind of it. So I found looking at

02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:39.760
like secondary literature. And like I said, I really recommend that book by Eric Pearl.

02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:45.760
You realize that it is actually a completely different way of approaching philosophy, a completely

02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:50.400
different way of thinking about the world. And you actually have to like set aside all your sort of

02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:57.040
modern prejudices in how you think about the world and how you approach questions about reality.

02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:02.880
And it's actually, you know, it has its own kind of feeling and logic to it. But then once you

02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:08.480
imbibe that, you realize that, you know, it's such a radically different way of doing things.

02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:13.120
And it really does solve a lot of modern problems. So yeah, I think people should take an early

02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:18.000
look at Platonism and Ereval's channel is very good. I also shared, I know you promote them,

02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:23.440
you interview them. I shared this channel on my Telegram. I'm forgetting the name,

02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:29.600
is it like E.C. Winsper? Yes, that's it. E.C. Winsper. Yeah, I recommend that channel as well.

02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:34.960
And you can find Ereval's interview with them where they have another discussion about Plato.

02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:40.320
But yeah, thanks for joining me, Ereval. I appreciate it. Thanks for everyone that tuned

02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:46.800
in, sent super chats. And yeah, potentially, I'll be back next week. I'm going to have

02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:52.960
Tyler Hamilton debating Adam Green on the historicity of Jesus in two weeks from now,

02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:58.560
which I think will be an interesting debate. And yeah, that's all for now, everyone. So take care.

02:40:59.440 --> 02:40:59.920
Thanks, Keith.
