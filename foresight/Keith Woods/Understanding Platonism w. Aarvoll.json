{"text": " All right, I'm live, I'm here with Ervol, and we're going to be discussing Platonism. How are you doing, Ervol? Not too bad, yourself? Yeah, not too bad. I finally, we were meant to do this last week, actually. I didn't give people a reason why we cancelled, but I ended up getting that illness everyone has been talking about. And, you know, I heard the latest strain was meant to be quite mild, but it's definitely was one of the one of the worst viruses I've had. But yeah, doing pretty good. But yeah, as far as Platonism, I mean, some people know you as like the Plato guy, you know, you're, but you're doing a reading group on it now, which you could chill for later if people are interested in that. But yeah, I mean, I guess the first question is why do you think going back to Plato is of relevance or of such importance? Right. Well, in a lot of ways, Plato was in a similar situation to the one that we're in. The traditions of his time had been breaking down. You know, if you look at the behavior of the Sophists, it resembles that of postmodern academics today, deconstructing things, saying the truth is relative, having no reverence for the gods or eternal realities and things of that nature, reducing everything to kind of flux and accidents of the one kind of true material substrate materialistic monism. And Plato found a way of harmonizing the gods, his tradition, his the ways of his people with this rationalistic current. And the historical influence obviously alone justifies going back to Plato. I don't think you can really seriously claim to be a philosopher or to seriously study philosophy unless you go through the works of Plato, not just because there are so many fundamental ideas introduced into the history of Western philosophy through Plato, but because the rest of the philosophical tradition is responding to Plato in one way or another, often uncharitably, you know, unfairly Nietzsche's critiques of Plato I see is so much question begging. I know Heidegger has some critiques and often people in these spheres will have read some of these critiques or have heard about some of these critiques of Platonism. And then without actually studying Platonism, they write it off because the people that they respect write it off. I think it's a similar phenomenon to the people who get into like alternative physics you'll often find or at least I often find these people on YouTube who have this, you know, new model of physics like vortex physics or physics derived from like the 10 basic numbers, kind of like Pythagoreanism. But the reason people go for those things is that the people putting forward these radical alternatives at the same time are saying the entire history of mathematics and physics up until this time has been wrong. And then you watching the video say, oh, well, that's convenient because I don't know any of that anyway. So now I can just listen to this guy and get it all from him. So I think this kind of anti Platonism offers an out from doing the real work of learning the Western philosophical tradition from the ground up. You can't understand any of antique philosophy without understanding Platonism. You can't understand scholasticism. You can't understand the thinking of the Renaissance. You really just can't understand anything in the history of Western philosophy without Plato. And like I said, the main reason, though, is that we're in a similar position where if we don't harmonize the scientific knowledge that we have today with metaphysics, with our traditional theological conceptions, many of which basically all of which derived from Platonism, we're not going to have something to unify us going forward. It takes more than just kind of emotive, you know, something a, you know, ineffable quality that people have in a particular sphere that galvanizes them. Like that's not what actually builds long lasting historical movements. There has to be a kind of crystalline ideological core that keeps an organization going keeps a group going and motivates them. Pythagoreanism did that. Platonism did that through institutions on the one hand schools and a core philosophy that people shared in common that explicit philosophical consensus is the only way to get ethical consensus. So, you know, political practicalities, learning the history of Western philosophy, and then also, which I didn't mention yet, I do think that Platonism has the metaphysical toolkit to address the metaphysical deficiencies of modern physics, right? We have excellent understanding of dynamics in modern physics, but we don't know very much at all about the substrate. What are these things that are behaving in the ways that the wave function behaves? You know, what is the stuff that the universe is made of? And what categories can we draw metaphysically to make sense of all of that? So, Platonism is just one of the most well developed metaphysical frameworks in history. And I think anyone who's trying a theory of everything these days, like I saw you had Chris Langan on, you know, he's a key example. I mean, a lot of his ideas are similar to Platonism. I think he would recognize that. So, yeah, I mean, I think to understand the past, to put us together, gather us together today in a harmony, and then moving forward for better scientific groundwork for a worldview. Yeah, well, there is that quote by Alfred North Whitehead that the safest generalization of Western philosophy is the series of footnotes to Plato. And I saw an exaggeration like Richard Rorty, who's the famous American pragmatist, or like a, you know, a complete relativist, moral relativist, he rejects philosophy. And I forget which one of his books it was, but he wrote in the introduction that his task was basically to get rid of Platonism. And he also, he made some, might seem like a radical claim, but he said that all philosophy since Plato was Platonism, because his claim was that even the people that have rejected Plato have done so with kind of Platonist starting point, and even just the idea that, you know, thought and reality, cohere in the way Plato imagined. But yeah, I mean, I do think it's a problem, especially in like sort of, you know, the St. Raider where you want to call it circles, that people, people obviously come at philosophy, you know, at other motivations, they're not necessarily trying to get a great grasp of the whole Western canon. I guess they generally have a more instrumental view of things. And so I find you get too much, you get a focus on, you know, thinkers like Evella, Spengler, Nietzsche, obviously. But people want to kind of, you know, they want like to kind of a simple metric to kind of read all of Western thought through some kind of based metrics like Nietzscheanism, or even like kind of a very simplified, like a Heideggerian critique of techniques and of philosophy. And yeah, that definitely leads to oversight. I think there is a kind of like, you know, meme Nietzscheanism that permeates the right a lot, especially as it comes to Plato. So I mean, the basic kind of Nietzschean critique of Plato, you see something like Spencer said this a lot that Plato was like the, it was the start of this nihilism that came to fruition with Christianity, where we started to kind of lessen the value of the physical world, and imagine this perfect world of forms. And that as soon as that, as soon as we started that endeavor, as soon as we started to try and find some perfect world of pure thought, or, you know, so there's some other world that we started on the path to nihilism, and it was kind of inevitably going to lead to all of the kind of life denying philosophies we have now and some of the, even like the sort of extreme liberalism, some people argue that like in the, you know, the kind of transhumanist ethic. So I'm curious, like, what do you think of that kind of basic kind of quasi Nietzschean criticism of Platonism? Yeah, like, so again, I don't know exactly how true that is to Nietzsche himself, but it is characteristically Nietzschean in the sense that it's not really an argument, strictly speaking. It's saying, you know, I don't like the conclusion that you came to. I'm sentimentally averse, like saying that it leads to nihilism is a kind of moral consequentialism from a moral nihilist, which doesn't even make sense. But yeah, I think the the issue that Nietzsche has with Platonism is not unique to Platonism. You go all the way back to, like, Siberian shamanism, presumably from the Paleolithic period, and they had this idea that the world was divided up into different realms, you know, like you see in Norse mythology on Yigitrasil. There are various realms that you can travel between. And there's good reason why people had these beliefs. There has been a history of spiritual practice that led a lot of people around the world to common ideas about what sorts of realms are accessible, what sorts of forces are there to tap into in that realm. If they were all completely wrong, if there is no, you know, supernatural realm whatsoever, then why did these beliefs all persist? And it's just, you know, question begging saying there isn't any such thing. But you can't just presume that you can't just presuppose the world simply is time, space, causality, and what we see around us. And that's it. If you buy an evolutionary explanation of perception, which I assume most people who would buy that pseudo Nietzschean critique would, you wouldn't expect evolution to select for the perceptual apparatus that would perceive the genuine like ontological substrate of reality. You would expect evolution to select for perception of fitness payoffs above all. So we'll be myopically focused on certain facets of reality, like this narrow spectrum of the electromagnetic spectrum that's narrow bandwidth, visible light. But we don't actually, you know, know reality just because we see things. This is the way that we navigate is like a user interface that has developed to help us survive as biological creatures. There's no reason to think that the categories, the basic intuitive naive categories like matter naively conceived just is what reality is at base. According to evolutionary theory, wouldn't expect that an evolutionary game theory, Donald Hoffman came up with the, the fitness beats truth theorem. And he modeled various evolutionary scenarios and demonstrated that, you know, evolution does not select for perception of the true nature of whatever system this evolution is taking place in. It selects for like myopic perception of fitness payoffs. And the key insight of Platonism and Pythagoras before him was saying that actually, you know, the way that the world seems at face masks, a deeper harmony that operates according to, you know, different logic than the logic of everyday reality, you know, bumping into stuff, things colliding like base naive materialism. Actually, when you investigate the things of the material world and kind of draw down to their syntactic core, the underlying logic behind mundane phenomena, we find these mathematical structures. And that line, that Platonizing line of putting an ontological status on universals and mathematical objects led to taking those things seriously, building out a mathematical model of the world. And that actually led to scientific progress. Right. So the idea of another world is not prima facia ridiculous. It would kind of be strange if the universe in its entirety was simply what we see around us, like the observable universe just is reality. We don't have an explanation if we just go with this kind of naive perception of the world as it seems, we don't have an explanation for where the laws of physics reside. We don't have an explanation for what universal properties are what ontological status they have. Right. It's just a very incomplete model of the world that like, and we know that that kind of perception of the world as being fundamentally flux, you know, inevitably tied to matter, didn't actually build the math science technology that the modern world is based on. It was the the Platonizers through our history. You mentioned Alfred North Whitehead, you know, he worked with Bertrand Russell, who also studied Plato. He criticized Plato in his history of Western philosophy book. But a lot of his mature developments are obviously inspired by Platonism, including this kind of intermediate status of mathematical objects. And so they tried to work up something that was actually in the spirit of Leibniz, a kind of characteristic universalist universal logical language with their Principia Mathematica, which was largely successful. Their kind of systematizing of logic mathematics led to developments in computer. So it was practically useful. But Russell, who was inspired by Platonism, wouldn't have had this idea unless he was a scholar of Leibniz, which he was, and Leibniz was a Platonist. And his ideas fit very neatly into Neoplatonism, up to including the idea of the monad, this kind of fractal embodiment that the monad possesses, we can maybe get into a little bit, a little bit of that later. You know, Frege, who started analytical philosophy, was a Platonist. And then Goethel, who disproved the basic intention of Principia Mathematica, which was inspired by this computationalist theory of mathematics, where if we just have the right set of axioms and algorithms, we can have full systematic proof of all propositions. Goethel said, no, you can't. And, you know, that was because Goethel grasped an aspect of our cognitive faculties that the Platonist grasped that Russell wanted to leave out, which was intellect, properly speaking, or the mathematical intuition, which is not exclusively mathematical. But anyway, it's just you see the influence of Platonism through and through with the history of modern philosophy, ancient philosophy. And to say you don't like the idea of some other realm or that there's something beyond the world that we see, like, where does that come from? I get the kind of instinct to say, like, you know, the way I've always thought about the world since I was three, the basic way I perceive things, that's just what it is. And we don't have to go beyond that. And all this math, well, we like abstract the math from the world. And while that may be in a certain regard epistemologically true, not wholly true, because we also have these intuitions that are not via induction. Yeah, we, nevertheless, you can't make sense of that kind of account of mathematical objects of universals without, at the same time, relying on their ultimate validity, like to express the position of nominalism, you're going to have to use Platonic realism or a belief in the reality of universals. I might be using a bit too much philosophical jargon for people who are not already into Platonism. But well, I mean, it's a very, it's a very nihilistic position in a way to take this kind of sort of meme, natuionism approach to everything where you're kind of judging, you're judging theories based on like how life affirming there, like you're treating philosophy as this sort of therapeutic existentialist cure to the human condition. And you know, you're already presupposing that there's there's no objective truth to be found or you're already presupposing like this metaphysical anti realism. But someone in someone in the chat said, you know, we're going to be discussing Platonism. So he said, you know, and get ready to hear loads of things that aren't epistemically justified. So I guess that that would be another attitude. You definitely find it a lot in people that study philosophy now that they kind of assume that well, you know, you have classical philosophy here. But you know, something happened along the way. And these people didn't really interrogate their kind of epistemological starting point, you know, they didn't they didn't really interrogate like what the mind can can really know about the world. And you know, we've had Hume and Kant and these people sense and, you know, the kind of Copernican turn turn in philosophy. And so this kind of naive kind of approach to metaphysics is is very outdated. And you're kind of better starting with with more sort of analytical stuff. So like, what would you say the the starting point is for you as a Platonist? Like, you know, do you assume a kind of naive, you know, are you just sort of start with the assumption that there's this coherence between the mind and ultimate reality? Or do you think that there's like a series of sort of smaller scale justifications along the way that have to bring you there? Like, do you start with epistemology? Yeah, well, I'm not a foundationalist in my own philosophy. So there's no one starting point, you know, I like Quine Willard Quine's Holism, where, you know, inevitably, one proposition, one theory will implicate other theories in your kind of toolkit. And so ultimately, a whole worldview has to develop organically. And in terms of internal consistency, and then in terms of explanatory power, in terms of predictive power, all of these metrics, and then you evaluate whole frameworks on that basis, rather than the foundationalist attempt at epistemological grounding, where like empiricism, all knowledge is built up from sense data. And that's, you know, this kind of model of how we come to have knowledge was really, you know, devastated by Willard Quine in, I think, the 50s. So in analytical philosophy today, that's not a popular epistemological position. Actually, that innovation, this kind of Holism and pragmatism, Quine was a pragmatist, was already there in the old academy, under carnities, I think, when the Platonists took a turn towards skepticism, academic skepticism, was very different from the other ancient, the other popular ancient skeptical school of Pyranism, which basically held that all knowledge is simply impossible. And it was mostly about just kind of reaching a this catharsis and, you know, comfortable state of mind, resting in a poria, resting in uncertainty, you know, what, what are you going to do? You can't really figure out anything anyway. Whereas academic skepticism was about like, let's put forward hypotheses and build up this theory while admitting our own fallibility all the while. Now, within Platonism, there are theories about the basis of higher level knowledge. I think the most famous example is the divided line from the Republic. So if you remember in book seven of the Republic, when he discusses the cave, he illustrates the example of the cave afterwards with this concept of the divided line. So you take a line, which symbolizes the unity of mind as a whole, divide it in two, but unequally. So one part is larger, one part is smaller, the largeness of this segment of the line represents the security and, you know, firmness of our grasping of intelligible. So the larger segment is intelligible reality. And then the smaller segment is sensible reality. And we have faculties associated with each of these targets of knowledge. So we have two discrete faculties that deal with intelligibles and two discrete faculties which deal with sensibles. And so you divide the shorter segment according to the same ratio, which is the ratio of bi, and the smallest of all segments will have to do with our recognition of images as such. You know, Schopenhauer had a similar distinction between, you know, pure sensation and perception. So for, this is already there in Neoplatonism by the time of Iamblichus and arguably, I mean, by the time of Plato himself, Iamblichus actually ascribes the concept of the divided line and these, this theory of cognitive faculties to Architas of Tarentum, who is an elder contemporary of Plato, early member of the Academy, you know, genuine, you know, old Pythagorean contributed to development mathematics and all of that. But yeah, this, so at the bottom, we have this faculty of basically sensation or imagination, which has to do with recognizing similarity and dissimilarity. That's the distinguishing feature of that cognitive faculty, which is Icazia in Greek. And then we have doxar belief, which is what Schopenhauer would call perception, where instead of just treating the raw kind of phenomenological appearance of form and distinguishing forms in that lower sense, like the shape of things in their similarity, we have the, you know, hypothesis of some underlying reality, which we only know by inference, just as Schopenhauer says, we don't know the objects of material reality directly. We infer from the presence of sense data, you know, Locke basically agrees with this, this model of things as well, and they got it from the ancients, you know, this stuff was already there in Plato. And then on the intelligible side, the smaller faculty is Dianoya, which is discursive reasoning, which is step by step procedures, you know, similar to the computationalist project of Russell and Whitehead. And then above that kind of reason, there is intellect or noose, which is an intuitive faculty, and you have to have this idea to make mathematics work. There has to be something in our mind that allows us to find correct axioms for mathematics, right? You can't prove the validity of an axiom in math through any mathematical formal system. So there has to be something beyond Dianoya that we're using there. So this basic, you know, schema of the psyche, I think holds pretty true, you know, and it's interesting that Dianoya has a kind of dual role. So there's a strict sense of Dianoya where we see its peculiar energies, activities, most starkly, which is in mathematical and logical reasoning, but also the literal translation is through thinking. And it is what basically moves us from Icazia to Daxa to Dianoya, strictly speaking, to the intellect. And yeah, so there's something mathematical or logical or like Turing machine like about human cognition, broadly speaking. And yeah, that's it's a very interesting notion that ties in with the idea of the soul, the composition of the soul, the essence of the soul that you see in the Timaeus, when the Demiurge constructs the world soul, he constructs that soul out of ratios. He takes the powers of two and the powers of three, and through a set of kind of algorithmic procedures, builds all of the ratios that we get in music of the perfect fifth, perfect fourth, octave, and so forth. And, you know, this is the composition of the essence of the soul in some way. So math is on the same level as soul. Some people might have heard in Platonism that mathematical objects are an intermediary level between the forms, which are unitive, unextended, and then material reality, which is divisible about body. So math is an intermediary. So is soul. So soul and math are very intimately related. And, you know, if we're going to follow the prescription of the Delphic Oracle to know thyself, we also have to know math, which kind of ties into this idea, like people criticize Plato for turning his back on tradition. Well, I mean, he references one commandment from the Oracle to double the size of a particular altar, and they realized that they couldn't do it mathematically, because they didn't know how to calculate double the volume of this shape. So it revealed a kind of defect of mathematical reasoning. So in that instance, Plato refers to what are the gods telling us? They're telling us we don't know enough math yet. And, yeah, I kind of ramble a little bit at the end there. But I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was muted. Yeah, that's another kind of interesting disagreement is the time when Plato came along. So again, this is where you get there's kind of a Nietzschean version of this versus kind of a more traditionalist version of this. So the kind of Nietzschean version of it is that, you know, Socrates should have been put to debt because he was questioning the gods. He was undermining the social order of where he lived. And, you know, he was trying to apply universal reason in this way that was kind of undermining the particularist paganism of his society. And again, that this is like a very nihilistic enterprise. Now, if you read Julius Evela actually criticizes this few a lot, he says that this is like a really bad reading of things that actually what Plato was doing was in a current where Sophism and Humanism had become kind of dominant intellectually, he says it's actually very similar to our own time that what Plato was actually doing was kind of, you know, he's kind of revivifying like a traditionalist cosmology. So again, it's kind of interesting. It's two very different readings. You know, Plato is this sort of libtard revolutionary that's like subversive Socrates subversive versus actually, you know, Plato is seeing like the nihilistic elements thought of his time and he's trying to have things on this more solid foundation and I kind of ground a proper view of things again. So, yeah, can you speak to that a little bit like the, you know, the time frame where Plato was operating like kind of the popular current of thought that he's responding to and what you think of that idea of it being kind of subversive to the society at the time? Right, yeah. Well, the reason why Socrates probably was actually put to death was his connection with members of the 30 tyrants, the puppet regime that Sparta installed after the end of the Peloponnesian War. There's a lot of quotes throughout the dialogues where Socrates seems to reverence the Spartans, you know, mentioned that they are actually really good philosophers and that's why they have these laconic sayings. They're so pithy. So it was probably a matter of questioning Socrates' loyalty and, you know, the charge of impiety and was he questioning the gods? I mean, if you look at, you know, again, in the Republic, Thrasomachus or in the Gorgias, Calakles, the way these characters, the kind of protonegians of their day, were talking about the gods was far more sacrilegious than anything Socrates ever indicated. And I think Plato had a sincere piety. I mean, Neoplatonists all the way down to late antiquity were, you know, practicing their rights. They were worshiping the gods. So this charge of sacrilege or impiety or denying the existence of the gods was probably just an excuse to get rid of someone who the, you know, Democrats in power in Athens, viewed to be a threat to the state because of their questionable loyalty. And then the large influence they had on prominent young noble citizens, you know, Socrates would go around the city finding, you know, the Alcibiades is the competent, talented young men, not to indulge whatever pederastic impulse he may have had, which he never endorses explicitly. Plato never endorses that it is acknowledged as a common sentiment, you know, among many different Greek city states. But Plato rejects that anyway. But it wasn't for that reason that Socrates associated with young men, it was to influence the future thinking of the political class of Athens. So yeah, I mean, I see Plato basically is trying to save respect for the gods, respect for this higher realm from the deconstruction of people like Gorgias or Protagoras. I mean, the Sophists are really one of the chief currents that he's responding to, but also the rationalistic philosophy of the Ionian school, you know, the best example that directly influenced Plato was Anaxagoras, who taught Pericles, the great Athenian statesman, and also Socrates studied the works of Anaxagoras. And what Plato liked about Anaxagoras was the put this principle of mind first, which none of the other Ionian preseocratics did. They kept things very kind of physical in their conception, although I do think that's an oversimplification. But with the actual writings of Anaxagoras, according to Socrates in the, which dialogue was this, might even be Thedo, not sure. But anyway, he says that Anaxagoras, the writings had to do with like physical laws. He was more like a physicist than a philosopher, strictly speaking. And it was this rationalism combined with the deconstructing Sophists and rhetoricians of his day that Plato had to respond to. And they were sacrilegious. I mean, the Orphism was just a kind of history of the tendencies in that day. Orphism spread from around 600 BC in the wake of basically a dying off of respect for the older, you know, perhaps Mycenaean way of worshiping the gods. So they already broke down their their previous religious rituals. And Orphism came in the wake of that with this kind of more mystical, more experiential brand of religion. And of course, the mystery schools were still popular. But there was a kind of irrationalism introduced. And, you know, an emphasis on individual experience. And basically, Plato had to fit that brand of spirituality together with this rationalistic philosophy. And then the Pythagorean influence coming from the Eliadex, the Italian school. And yeah, I mean, he just kind of found the best harmony to bring it all together. I think we might actually be overestimating how much is original to Plato, because we don't know very much about his Pythagorean associates, we have a couple fragments of Arcatas, of, you know, Philo Laos, or some of the other people, or Aristocenus or something in his school. But Plato was originally interested in writing plays, he wrote poems. And then when he met Socrates, he decided, this isn't the way to go, I have to do something in the vein of this emerging trend of philosophy, which he correctly foresaw, would have this massive influence on society. And so he shifted his artistic endeavors, but he kind of remains like, really tied to the format of the dialogue, to constructing these organic holes, you know, his concepts and aesthetics, many of which were probably original, can be seen today still in concepts like what makes an integrated work of art. But that's, I think, where Plato's heart was, and he fit all of these tendencies of thought into one harmonious whole. So he was really a synthesizer of the ideas at his time. And, you know, he did it successfully, he built the institution that needed to be built, and his way of thinking largely won out. Although, of course, Aristotle disagreed in certain ways, he was still largely a Platonist, you know, the agreement between Aristotle and Plato is much greater than the disagreement. And so Aristotle gets kind of more credit, perhaps because, as Alexander spread Hellenism, you know, Aristotle had a pride of place for a couple centuries, and then later Platonism had a resurgence. So, you know, there's an argument to be made that maybe Aristotle contributed more in certain respects than Plato. Again, I'm kind of digressing from your point. But yeah, I think Plato is trying to harmonize the currents of his day, and save the gods and save his traditional ways of worship, and at the same time, arrive at the truth underlying reality. It's like this nihilism that you mentioned, you can't just want the world to be a certain way, and then like, blind yourself to what may actually be out there. You can't know the nature of underlying reality unless you question these basic concepts. If you just presume that there are no universals, there are only particulars, and realities, this basic flux, like, why do you think that, how do you justify that? If you're going to try to build a rationalistic framework, you're going to have to basically go along with what Plato did. Plato was the first one to do it in a serious way, the Pythagoreans, and then Plato. And there's, everyone kind of followed in his train because there's probably one true nature to reality. And, you know, this is the perennial philosophy idea, you're not going to digress from that very far. And so if Plato put it adequately, then kind of have to take the tools that you're given. And Plato is very traditional for us. I mean, you can't understand modern Western civilization without him. So, yeah. Yeah, Platonism is, it is the kind of metaphysics of the perennial philosophy. I mean, I think Shu'an of the traditional school basically considered neoplatonism, like kind of a divine revelation to the West, like it's the Western version of the perennial philosophy. But you mentioned Pythagoras. I remember, I don't know if you saw, like a decade ago, they supposedly uncovered that there was like a secret Pythagorean message in the Republic that every 12 lines, there was a mention of music and they were speculating that you could, you could create like musical notes out of out of messages he'd inserted in there with numbers. And that this was a sign that Plato was like a secret Pythagorean because the Pythagorean sect was persecuted at the time. Now Pythagoras, you know, obviously like the vegetarianism and some of his ideas, I think there is a popular idea that he got his philosophy from India, right, that he traveled to India and he kind of brought back Vedanta. There's also, I don't know if this is confirmed, but there's also theories that Plato took his philosophy from like mystery schools in Egypt. So do you have any insight in terms of like kind of like an esoteric element to Plato or kind of a religious origin of his teachings? Or, you know, is the similarities to the perennial philosophy? Is that just kind of a testament to, you know, reason brings you to this system if you follow it fair enough? Yeah, my basic model of the axial age as a whole is that it diffuses from the Punjab basically. The Upanishadic philosophy originates around year 1000 BC, and then we see movements towards rationalistic, I mean, Upanishads are written in dialogue form, that's healthy something, many of them. So these ideas of perennialism I see is coming out of India primarily, although there may be more ancient, similar systems out of Egypt. So like we have to remember this time period in the aftermath of the Bronze Age collapse, right? There was a 2000 year long civilization from 3000 BC to 1000 BC, very roughly speaking, that was on a larger scale in many ways, better organized than the state of things in the Greek Dark Ages, for example, which is the times that, you know, classical antiquity comes out of. And those Bronze Age civilizations had a common source, right? Prior to the civilizations properly speaking, there were advanced, you know, city based cultures in Syria, in Iraq, you know, the Fertile Crescent, and, you know, in Egypt, starting around 5000 BC, arguably a little bit older, but going all the way back to 10,000 BC. And this happens with the spread of Neolithic technologies generally, they're identifiable gene clusters that are associated with this, that we are related to in many ways. So like a lot of people want to go back to the Bronze Age and learn as Aryans or whatever. But like we're also this kind of ancient Neolithic, Neolithicizing force, like a third of our ancestry is associated with that Anatolian hunter-gatherer population that was integral to the spread of the Neolithic. And it's that bundle of technologies that seeded what would later become the civilizations in southern Iran, in the Indus Valley, so Indus Valley civilization. And I imagine that, I mean, they were all in contact, there was trade between the Indus Valley civilization and Egypt via, you know, Fertile Crescent intermediaries. But ideas spread during that whole preceding arc of civilization. So it may be then that what we see coming out of Upanishadic philosophy is really a resurgence of older Indus Valley traditions, not that all of them, all of the beliefs of Vedanta come out of that. Obviously, the rest of the Vedas are still significant, the ritual forms, the ideas contained in the older sections of the four Vedas matter religiously to Hindus. But some of these ideas, like maybe reincarnation, although there are some Indo-European precedents, it's far from a settled matter. But yoga, for example, I would say very likely comes from the Indus Valley civilization complex rather than an Indo-European innovation. So maybe some of what we see in Plato that looks Indian, I mean, that's what I recognize, that's why I was able to understand Plato as well as I was when I first read it. You know, I got into the Neoplatonist later, I read Plato directly, and I saw it basically through a lens of Vedanta, and it made sense through that lens fairly easily. Like a lot of the ideas are the same up to and including the tripartite soul, you have basically, you know, intellect, thumos, epithumia, or appetite, which equates to Satva, Rajas, and Thomas in Hinduism. So anyway, some of this stuff that looks Indian might just be the ancient Bronze Age layer that Plato and Pythagoras got from Egypt, from the Chaldeans, you know, the Syrians basically. And there's, you know, one more esoteric aspect here that might be in the background, which is Plato's idea of Atlantis. And if you look at the beginning of the Neolithic, I have a four-part series on prehistory, the fourth part deals with, you know, the emergence of civilization. It's probably the most condensed anthropology lecture you could watch on that period of time from like 15,000 BC down to 3000 BC. A lot happens, you know, and we're not sure how these developments take place, or why, and why they're so fast, why they're so concentrated in one particular region, like how the people who built Gobekli Tapu, for example, learned how to deal with megaliths overnight, and then they got worse at it, which is not what you would expect, right, if they just came out of a hunter-gatherer society. So people have often speculated that there was a more advanced civilization prior to the Younger Dryas, which runs from, you know, basically 11,000 to 10,000 or 9,500 BC. And that was a kind of mini ice age. So it had been warming up from 20,000 years ago until, you know, 13,000 years ago. And it's very likely that, you know, just as with the Holocene warming, we saw the emergence of larger populations, you know, larger settlements, you had a similar thing happen at the end of the Upper Paleolithic. And then that was upset by the Younger Dryas very suddenly, you know, in a matter of decades, the temperature dropped, you know, five, six degrees globally, something really extreme. And that lines up with the timeframe that Plato actually gives for the myth of Atlantis. So, I mean, you can make of that what you will. I give credit to those theories of an advanced ancient civilization, because there are archaeological anomalies that just have no explanation whatsoever. You can obviously ignore those like the Baalbek, Megalith, or some of the structures in Egypt that seem to predate other structured people speculate about a date of the Sphinx being older. You know, I'm not sure about each particular piece of evidence, but an expert in archaeology, but there are many such sites. There's a Megalith underwater between Sicily and Italy, I think, and no one knows. It seems to be 13,000 years old, no one knows who built it or how. Some of these anomalies that point to the possibility of some advanced culture, we could go further into that obviously, but it's a long digression. But if there was this ancient high civilization, they just think about what kind of technology they would have developed. They were different genetically than later peoples. They had higher Neanderthal admixture, and the structure of the Neanderthal brain was quite different. Their cerebellum was larger, the human, the Homo sapiens, cerebrum is larger. Neanderthals were very intuitive in their ways of doing things. The forms of their tools didn't change very much over hundreds of thousands of years, and yet they were successful. We have a hard time replicating their tools. It was like they had an extreme ability to get the knack of something. What humans are good at is innovating and thinking analytically and combining things in different ways, whereas the Neanderthals kind of felled their channel and their groove and really just settled into it. So that might have been more like the way of thinking of this ancient high civilization, and people speculate whether it had something to do with acoustics, the rise of advanced upper Paleolithic cultures in Europe coincides with the first musical instruments. Many of the important ritual sites are also coincidentally caves that have great acoustics. So you could speculate some kind of acoustic-based technology in the upper Paleolithic, culminating in a high civilization that maybe did have an empire, basically, like Plato says that Atlantis had, and then it was rapidly destroyed by the onset of the Younger Dryas, which may or may not have been started by a comet. Right now, the evidence does look like it started with a comet. So that's the most esoteric side of Platonism, is Platonism through the Pythagoreans that he knew and through his own travels. He traveled for 10 years after Socrates died. So Plato himself may have actually made it to India. So there is probably some Indian wisdom in there, some vestigial bronze age wisdom via the Chaldeans and via the Egyptians, and then perhaps this most ancient layer, which we can only speculate about, but it is fun to speculate about that. Yeah, I used to be really into Atlantis archaeology stuff as well. I think the most interesting angle is there was a guy, Schwaller de Lubitz, who was like an Egyptologist and a mystic. And he inspired John Anthony West, who's a really good book on Egypt called Serpent in the Sky, where he gets into like the cosmology of the ancient Egyptians and how that was reflected in their architecture. But he speculated that, both of them speculated that the Sphinx was like eroded by water. It's the back when there was rain in the Sahara Desert. The second guy West actually hired this guy called Robert Schock, who is like a geologist who's an expert in stuff to actually study the pattern of erosion on the Sphinx. And he did conclude that it was from rainfall, and he actually ended up dating it to like 9,700 BC, which was the date when Plato gave for the fall of Atlantis. So yeah, there's a lot of interest in esoteric red pills there. But yeah, I mean, I guess to get into like the sort of meat and bones of Platonism, obviously, you know, one thing you've touched on a bit and that people obviously associate most of Plato is this idea of the forms. Now, just before we get into it, I mean, can you give like a basic background of why does Plato propose the forms in the first place? And how do they help him make sense of the world in a way that he thinks other philosophers are missing? Right. Well, a lot of it is tied to the ethical focus of Socrates, right? I think if you read Xenophon, Socrates does come across as more of this strictly moral philosopher. Plato maybe puts a bit more Pythagoreanism into the mouth of Socrates than Socrates actually held to. But the way we are introduced to the concept of the forms through the dialogues is often Socrates asking about the nature of something like wisdom, or just virtue in general, and trying to get down to what actually is this that we're talking about. If there are only particular virtuous men, but no true virtue, then the idea that there are particular virtuous men becomes vacuous, right? If you're going to take the existence of good seriously, if there is such a thing, if there is justice, they have to have some kind of metaphysical status, right? Like, it's nonsense to ascribe a label to a particular society or man unless that label has a meaning. Like, what is it ultimately referring to? This gets fleshed out kind of analogically with math, right? We have to believe that there is some perfect circle, because we never, like, where do we get the idea of perfect circularity? We can mathematically define it precisely, up to the point where you get the value of Pi coming out of it, which is irrational and goes on infinitely. So infinite, potentially infinite specification of this perfect circle. And yet, we don't see that in the empirical world anywhere. There's just, you know, there's no way of making sense of the labels that we apply to universal phenomena, moral concepts like justice or courage or things like that, or mathematical phenomena. So it's really, in the dialogues, it's presented in terms of, well, we're trying to explain what this thing is that people in common parliaments are referring to. You can keep it at that level and just say, well, this is the way people use this word. But if you never trace it back to some universal property or universal characteristic that all of these particulars actually have, and that universal has an independent ontological status, then there's no accounting for the similarity of the particulars. Why does the linguistic reference work? That is what nominalists miss. So, like, the thing is, we don't actually get great arguments for the theory of forms in many of Plato's dialogues. He leaves it at this kind of rudimentary stage. And many people would say the reason for that is that Plato reserved the more Pythagorean doctrines for his inner circle, for the people within the walls of the academy. And Thomas Taylor, the 18th and 19th century Platonist, wrote a book on Aristotle, where he basically said that Aristotle, just like Plato, was actually cloaking his real ideas, and that this was a tradition that went back to the Greek sages, to the Presocratics as well. It was viewed as taboo, for example, to expose the goings-on of the mystery cults. You couldn't tell people what happened at the mysteries of Lucis. And so similarly, because the philosophy of the Ionians comes out of a culture where these mystery schools had this preeminent place, the philosophy was tied with the doctrines of the mystery schools. And so certain elements of philosophy then were, you know, not for the masses. They were not for mass consumption, not for the Voipalloi. So, Aristotle cloaked his ideas through this kind of very dense and hard to parse prose, which is unprecedented in literary history, like the way that Aristotle wrote is unique. And he didn't just write that way because he was autistic, although it seems like he probably was, but because he was trying to cloak the kind of core metaphysical doctrines that he was actually talking around in some way, according to Thomas Taylor. Plato also cloaked his ideas by putting, you know, some parts of the core doctrine in one character's mouth, and then another part of the core doctrine in the mouth of Socrates and leaving the picture incomplete, often ending the dialogue in Aporia. And so this is a criticism that people will make of the theory of forms is that, well, exactly how does participation work? You know, what's the dynamic here ultimately? And the answer is it's actually a very complex technical system that you can abstract out of it. Proclus wrote a commentary on the Parmenides that spells this out. Nicholas of Cusa said that this was the most important book in the history of philosophy. Parmenides comment, sorry, Proclus' commentary on the Parmenides. But then on the other hand, Schopenhauer said it was the most tedious book in the world. So, you know, take that for what you will. But in this commentary, he, Proclus, spells out that Parmenides is not, as it first appears, just shooting down Socrates' theory of forms. In the dialogue, Socrates is young in his early 20s, maybe Zeno is about 40, and then Parmenides is older, 60, 70, or something like that. And Socrates listens to the arguments of Zeno for monism, basically. Zeno argues against multiplicity. Parmenides argues for unity. It's two sides of the same coin, and they represent the same basic philosophy, which is an offshoot of Pythagoreanism itself. And so if you read the Parmenides, which is very difficult to read, it's not like the other dialogues in a lot of ways. The beginning is easy enough, and then it gets into these long chains where Parmenides is meant to explicate the dialectical method. And it proceeds in a kind of mathematical way where you look at the kind of hypothesis, and then it's opposite, and then another set of opposites. And so you just get very lost in all of these considerations, like if there is no one, then there is the very high level of abstraction the whole time. So it's like, I read it the first time before I had read Proclas, and I basically just gave up trying to understand it about halfway through. I think anyone who's honest with themselves will say- Yeah, me too. I never finished Parmenides. No. Yeah, it's a different kind of thing. Well, Proclas makes it clearer. And so at face value, it seems like Parmenides is shooting down Socrates' theory, but what he's actually doing is pointing out that Socrates needs to introduce certain kind of fine distinctions, subtle distinctions in theory of forms to make them work. And the core doctrine that Proclas argues for in his commentary is the idea that there is the the unitive and imperticipable aspect of the form where they exist in themselves in the same way that like, you know, in physics, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the universal wave function kind of has its own form and existence eternally. It's a standing wave and particular things relate to it, relativistically, but it is this permanent reality. Well, the forms have to have an element like that. It's not that the forms extend like the analogy that Socrates ends up using is actually, I think Parmenides provides it for Socrates in the dialogue, but is like, okay, so the form of justice is like a sail, you know, a big piece of cloth that spreads over many particular men and touches them all. And Socrates is like, yeah, I guess it's something like that. But that doesn't work because it doesn't preserve the unity of this one thing that you're referring to, because obviously, the entire cloth has extension. So like, if the forms are only in particulars, that, you know, looks like Aristotle's hyalomorphism, then how it doesn't actually get you any closer to explaining this unitary characteristic that is seen in the multiplicity. That's the basic problem of the forms. How do you account for the similarity, the oneness in multiplicity? There has to be an element of the forms that is unitive, that is exempt, and for Plato, that does basically exist in a kind of realm independent of this realm. And this realm is dependent on it. And so it's not exactly that there's like a separate realm of forms, and then this realm, it's rather that this realm is an outgrowth of the realm of forms. And so there's a prior ontological status to these universals in the same way that there's a prior ontological status to the Schrodinger equation, or whatever medium it describes, right? The ether is older than any particular configuration of matter, let's say. Another analogy might be like in chess, you know, a particular position on the board, when like Nakamura and Carlson are playing, hasn't been reached before, it's still real, but it's not as essential to chess as like the way that the knight moves, or the number of squares on the board. Those more fundamental, more syntactic, more internal features of chess have a prior ontological reality. The particular position reached in Nakamura v. Carlson is dependent on the way that the knight moves, and the number of squares, and stuff like that. So you have to have this prior ontological status to general syntactic features of reality. Otherwise, good luck trying to explain how similarity works, how the laws of physics work, where they subsist, why math describes the world. It's just like there's really no coherent rational picture you can make unless you take this leap of saying, yes, there is an independent ontological status to these universal characteristics, which we describe and indicate in particulars in the world. All right, so if I just like play the nominalist for a minute, I mean, you could say why do the forms have to exist outside of our sort of shared abstraction? Well, the question is, why did we come to that shared abstraction? The question is, why does the abstraction work? It seems like nominalists always just ignore that question, like it doesn't get you any closer. Well, in the case of, like I said, we look at the form of hoarseness. Perhaps they would argue that with what we know about evolution, species are much more in flux, so we might recognize, and there's kind of intermediary species, and there isn't really a final end for species. There isn't a final hoarseness. So we're seeing many particular instances of horses, but what would a perfect horse be in that scenario? You could say like the most adaptive horse, but then that's like different, you could say for each horse dependent on like their geographical location or something. Yeah, well, that kind of raises the question of whether this system, this evolutionary context, had from the outset certain states, certain stable states that it could reach, right? If you're tied to like an a theory of time, if you're tied to like the world just is what's happening right now, and there's no eternal reality whatsoever, then you can try to skirt this question. But you'll be, if you try to do that, you'll be left with no theory of counterfactuals. David Lewis, contemporary philosopher, put forward the theory of modal realism to account for the truth status of counterfactual propositions. Statements like if Johnny had made the last basket, his team would have won the game, that can be true, like we can all recognize that that's true, but what is the referent? What is it that makes that statement true if there's no counterfactual thing that is being referred to? So Lewis just bites the bullet and like accepts the, yeah, these other worlds are out there. But anyway, what that allows you to do then in terms of identifying species is say that, okay, there is this evolutionary matrix, there's certain patterns of behavior that themselves have a universal reality, like evolution itself is a universal phenomenon. Okay, now where's that in the nominalist picture? Like again, any time you try to justify nominalism, you're going to have to fall back on some realist concept to ground it, because pure nominalism just dissolves into nonsense, because there can't be any like true reference ultimately, because things are changing too much. But anyway, you can say that there is a stable state within an evolutionary system by comparing all of the possible paths of evolution. And then you can describe basically as we do in quantum mechanics, a wave function that has the kind of probability of this stable outcome, which will have a particular center, there will be an archetypal member of the species that like most closely approximates that stable state that can find that stable solution, you know, evolution, it's their objective features that allow you to either succeed or fail. And you have those features or not. And they are there are a set of features that for a given environment are that most stable position. And we do see in evolutionary systems, not this gradual transformation between infinite intermediary forms. Instead, we see people and species locking into these stable types, archetypes that work, you know, geometrically, in terms of blood flow, like their physical constraints that define a range of variables. And there are stable, you know, values for that those sets of variables and unstable values. And again, across the spectrum of all possible worlds in which this evolutionary context happens, you can draw that kind of probability distribution, which will have a center on one ideal, most stable structure. All right, as far as let's say as far as it's applied to morality, like the you're talking about justice. So, you know, perhaps the modern nominalist would would say that your argument is kind of similar to the nature in one earlier, and that you're kind of pleading that well, you know, we need to have an objective morality, like it would be terrible if we didn't. So, you know, there needs to be some objective form of justice. And then, you know, they could come in with the evolutionary psychology and that kind of thing and say that these are just adaptive behaviors and whatnot. And you're trying to abstract that into something objective. Yeah, right. Well, the Plato is moralizing is very different from deontological moralizing. It's really like a statement of the matter of fact, like the way that Plato disproves Thrasomachus' claim in the Republic that justice does not always align with individual advantage that actually sometimes like its base to be just because you're just following basically falling for the slave morality of your time instead of like transcending and looking after your own individual benefit. But so you get down to an analysis of what exactly is meant by advantage, what is meant by the good of a particular actor. And the so an issue with platonic definitions, because he presumes there is this realm of stable archetypes out there, then we should be able to cut up our definitions to correspond to these like consistent features. And justice, for example, he defines in terms of the alignment of the three aspects of the soul where you are in charge of your lower nature. So platonic reasoning in the dialogues is often kind of messy because he's appealing to the particular preconceptions of the people that he's interacting with. That's like Socrates' Mayutic method. He takes people from where they are, uses the concessions that they make from their current state of knowledge and then draws them kind of upward from there. And so you don't get these like apodictically certain perfect demonstrations in the dialogues, more like what Aristotle sometimes aims at. But yeah, so this definition of justice just eliminates the possibility that you can be benefited while being unjust. Because like, do you care about your possessions? Do you care about your body? Or do you care about the state of your soul? All other mental states, whether pleasant or painful, depend on that configuration of soul in the first place. And if you accept that there is a best state of soul, to facilitate your own kind of proper enjoyment, which I think everyone accepts, there's like preferable mental states, preferable ways of thinking that lead to greater happiness, then justice is going to be the way to attain that unity within yourself. So it's really that he's giving a theory of what justice is, where these notions come from, because it can't be convention all the way down, right? It doesn't make sense. Again, going back to like an evolutionary context, in the set of all possible worlds where societies evolve, there are going to be stable structures that equate to some underlying feature of the nature of reality, and then there will be unstable structures. When evolution gets it right, when social evolution gets it right, and morality equates to this dharmic structure, which you could say is the kind of archetype standing behind the particular instantiation when it gets it right, it's stable. When it gets it wrong, it fails. So justice is a more claim of like a matter of fact, not we should have this, but you won't be happy unless you are just, and justice means each part of your soul doing its proper business, right? So if you don't accept that, then the claim will be that you will just suffer as a result. It's not that you need this justice, it's that you don't know what advantage actually is, and if you studied it methodically, and really evaluated what you mean by what is good for you, like if you want to make a consequentialist argument against Platonism and say that it leads to too much extraction, and actually it's not going to help your nation. Okay, well, what is going to help your nation? What is advantageous for your nation? That is a philosophical question that you can either presume that you already know, or you can investigate it. And if you investigate it, the contention would be if you properly investigated it, you would eventually come down to this Platonic theory of value of the good, of justice, of these particular moral qualities that people instantiate. Yeah, I don't really understand the argument that, you know, that evolution would kind of necessarily, that it would end up aligning our moral sensibilities with, you know, what's what's deramik, or what's objectively right? Right, well, the claim would be that there has to be an equivalence at some level, or correspondence, let's say, between the features, the objective features of reality, and the states that an evolutionary system takes up. So if you are not in line with the nature of reality, you're obviously going to make mistakes, right, your knowledge will not be well grounded, your behaviors will not be adaptive, adaptive behaviors will survive in a greater number of contexts overall than unadaptive behaviors. So it's perhaps, it's not right to say that evolution leads to moral perfection, or, you know, correct moral behavior all the time. But in order to survive, there has to be some correspondence between the way you're behaving and the structure of reality, right, your karma, individual conduct is tied to the dharma of your society, which is tied to the art or underlying nature of physical reality. These have to correspond, right, and particular evolutionary states will accord with that like proper dharma, or they'll deviate from it. And the claim is, if you deviate from that proper dharma, from that like stable evolutionary condition, then you're going to be selected out eventually. Yeah, I just don't see how that leads to an argument for, like, an objective justice and morality within that, because, you know, why can't it just be like adaptive behavior all the way down, right? Why does there have to be any objective content to, you know, the good behavior that results from that? Well, what's objective in it has to do, again, with that structure of underlying reality. So because there are only so many viable states, an evolutionary system can take up and survive, that constrains the range of what is going to be considered adaptive. That what is adaptive is tied to the nature of reality at base. Now, you know, couldn't it be that what led to thriving, what led to survival of evolutionary systems had no moral content? Well, the definition of morality we're coming up with here has to do with advantage, not evolutionary advantage, primarily. I mean, primarily, we're looking at individual experience. And when we talk about the benefit of individuals, it's in phenomenological terms, whereas in populations, we're talking about the benefit in genetic terms, you know. So it's kind of taking it out of its proper context. But we're saying, like, the claim is that what is adaptive is simply what's right. At the level of evolutionary systems, that applies, like, the proper Dharma is going to lead to flourishing of your community. And there is a proper Dharma, there is a way of doing that. So that's objective. Right. And then also at the level of the individual, if you think that you can reject the platonic concept of justice, and you can, and temperance, and you can let appetite run out of hand, and not rein it in with reason, and that'll be successful. Platonists would just say, no, you're just wrong. You're not going to be successful if you do that. So morality is, like, tied to advantage. That's the step that Socrates takes in reasoning in a few different dialogues, including the Alcibiades, which my reading group just went through. Does that make it any clearer? I mean, to work out the apparent... Well, it's just as soon as you tell it to what's adaptive, can't you just get really consequentialist about that? And, you know, maybe torturing babies from the other tribe is most adaptive for our immediate benefit, right? I mean, it just seems like as soon as you tie, as soon as you try and tie an objective good to what's adaptive, it just seems like, you know, everything is in flux at that point. Yeah, if you kept, that's why I mentioned this kind of distinction between evolutionary benefit, which is itself based on abstractions, like the gene itself is an abstraction. There's no single material entity that equates to a gene. The gene is defined differently depending on the context in evolutionary biology. So genes are an abstraction already. And the kind of evolutionary context is within a set of mental parameters of human theory, right? The reality is more well integrated than that, right? The individual morality component, the well-being of the soul of the creatures in these populations also factors into adaptivity. So our reductionistic material description of what is adaptive is incomplete. And like, you can't just think of morality in terms of evolutionary benefit. You also have to integrate it with the well-being of the individual soul. And I think what gets the, like, what is objective there, and not just hedonism, is where you get into this idea of the independence of the soul, making arguments for the fact that the human being is not the body. The human being isn't even the combination of the soul and the body. The human being uses the body to do his work. We could run through different thought experiments. We can demonstrate that. Plato has several arguments, but once you accept that the human being is the soul, and if you accept that the soul is immortal, which many people don't today, right? Because they haven't really dealt with this concept sufficiently, in my opinion. You know, I have my own arguments that I've developed. Plato has arguments. But once you take that step, then the consequences go beyond just an individual life filled with hedonic experiences. It goes into the structure of the soul that you are building through your action. And I think just empirically, that comes across in what makes people successful. Like, people who simply pursue immediate pleasure, if that's our concept of advantage here, are generally less happy on the whole than the people who structure their psyches, who like, do hard work to enforce justice in their own soul. Those people, whatever happens, they will be more resilient. Because the way that you experience whatever happens in the mundane world is filtered through the structure of your psyche. And so if you can build a positive structure into yourself, align the structure of your mind with the structure of reality, like through this logistic on through like logos guiding the rest of your activities, then you'll just be more content overall. It doesn't have this kind of ultimate moral force unless you speculate about consequences after death. And that's why like, all of these facets have to be combined in order to make sense of Plato's equivocation between advantage and justice. So basically, when people make the claim that in any particular case, what is really just differs from what is really advantageous, that's evidence for Plato that you just don't actually understand what justice really is or what advantage really is. Right. So there's, there's no like, Kantian idea that, you know, there's no like contrast between doing what's right and doing what's good for yourself. In a way, like you're always kind of pursuing your own good when you pursue the good. But so just back to the idea of the forms, right. So the way you were kind of speaking about the merrier and when you kind of contrast it with Aristotle. So it sounds like you do have kind of a view of like, so there's like, there's, you know, there's different interpretations of Plato, but there's a kind of two worlds interpretation of Plato that the forms exist in like another realm, so to speak. The book I'm reading currently is a book called Thinking Bean by Eric Pearl. You actually passed me on the recommendation from someone else, but he basically totally rejects this and says that this is a bad reading of Plato. And that in a way, like the way we commonly interpret Aristotle, he kind of attributes that to Plato and he says that Plato and Aristotle didn't really disagree at all on the nature of the forms. And then this passed on to Plotinus and Thomas Aquinas. He says there's like a kind of a straight thread the whole way through. But it's sort of like the way you were talking about the forms that you do accept more of like a sort of two worlds interpretation. So like, what is the nature of the forms? Are they on kind of a higher level of reality? Yeah, I would say they are on a higher level of reality, but it's not two separate worlds. It's more like the world branches from a root in the one, and then through the highest level categories and forms and the gods also and Plotinism, and then through specific differentiated structures. I would say if you're going to have a rational model of the world, it's going to have to look something like this with unity at the top to explain generic similarity of higher level features of reality, and then descending through particulars to more contingent, less ontologically fundamental aspects of the world. So our world here is less fundamental than those highest level features of the world. I mean, any particular state of a system is less ontologically fundamental than the syntactic arrangement of that system itself, the laws of the syntactic medium. That has to be prior. Particular states of any system are inconceivable unless there's some kind of previous order to the syntactic medium in which those states subsist. So it's not exactly there's two separate worlds. It's that there is, I mean, ultimately kind of one fundamental reality, the one contains the rest of being and the separation and distinctions that we observe are perspectives on that being and don't have a kind of fundamental independent ontological existence. You know, our perceptions now aren't fundamentally grounded in the way that the one is. Like obviously, it's inevitable that we exist, we are here, but are in order for our being to be there higher level features have to be the laws of physics have to be there. You know, other features of the world, the nature of soul in general has to be there, like a particular soul can't exist unless the structure of reality is such that this nature of soul does actually subsist in some way. Otherwise, what is that soul that we're talking about the ontology will have the only alternative is to make a totally bottom up ontology. And then once you take that step higher level theorizing really just becomes impossible. And it's not that like I rule out on foundationalist grounds, that kind of inductivist bottom up approach, it's that it's never been demonstrated to build a comprehensive model and Platonism has, you know, like Plato, for example, said the world may be in the shape of a dodecahedron. And, you know, in 2003, French team, analyzing, you know, the background microwave radiation imaging said that, you know, you can make sense of certain patterns in the background radiation by saying that the universe actually has the shape of a dodecahedron, or like the idea of the platonic solids providing a groundwork for the five elements in the Temaeus, you know, the tetrahedron being equivalent to fire and so forth. Well, the platonic solids do come up in particle physics, because that is the only possible shapes for the wave function of electrons in their orbits, for the wave function to kind of wrap around nucleus of an atom in three dimensions, the only possible shapes that can equate to the peaks of the wave functions have to be the vertices of platonic solids. And so like this method of, you know, assuming real ontological status to these higher things allows you to build a rational system with explanatory power. It has like, it worked for live nets, it worked for people who have done serious work. And this, the alternative, a totally flux based bottom up irrationalism, whatever, can't do that. Nobody's ever done, nobody's ever built the complete system without it. And you can reject it on pragmatic grounds alone by saying, okay, well, what are you going to build with it, man? Like, you have to build a complete theory in order to compete in this world, not to bring it all down to the pragmatic justification. But what's that? Did I answer your question or? Yeah, so, so my understanding of the forms is that, you know, in Platonism and Aristotelianism, the certain point is that being is intelligible. And so there's, there's no, you know, there's no like ultimate duality between subject and object and, you know, knowledge in the world. So the forms basically are the intelligible aspect of reality. And so they're more real than sensible objects. So sensible objects aren't a lesser copy of an invisible world. But it's basically like degrees of reality, going from absolutely nothing to pure ideas, which is, yeah. Yeah, am I am I getting that right so far? Yeah, I think probably a part of it is the language that the Greeks used for these different concepts, like all elements of the spectrum have reality. There's I mean, reality is kind of like a binary thing. It's either real or not. So degrees of reality doesn't make a lot of sense. But degrees of essence does make sense, right? And essence is the word Usia in Greek that is often translated as being misleadingly in English. And so this leads people to thinking that there's only one, you know, real being. And this is all just fake, like the world's fake, then that's not what it means. It's that the realities here are contingent on higher realities, they don't have self-subsisting essences, which is the definition of a new sea, right? So yeah, in essence is one example of this kind of metaphysical framework that the Platonists generated that can be helpful in thinking about these things, just like Aristotle's category categories are helpful for thinking about metaphysics. And also if people think that, you know, you don't have to replay them, you can't like evaluate, you can't, or rather you can evaluate this stuff based on a couple of people talking about it. It's ridiculous. Do your dang homework and go and like learn the foundations of Western philosophy, because you can't cram it in there and then like think you're going to understand it. But this system was built out of metaphysical distinctions. So you have energy or energy equated to activity, which is dependent on essence. So that's one kind of metaphysical relationship of contingency there. And essence is associated with particular energies. And then the energies of that being, you could break down into the different powers of capacity and actual behavior. And then above the essence of a thing, there is its hypothesis, the summit of its essence, which is the kind of existence, qua existence of that thing. And these words have meaning, these Greek terms actually do make sense in terms of like just the way that Aristotle's categories make sense of things. So it helps you make sense and it allows you to build up this comprehensive system. So you, I mean, it kind of makes sense that if you're going to be a Platonist, you have to take these terms seriously and really investigate what they truly mean. So the idea of an essence or an Ussia is tied to the idea of a definition, right? So that's why in in Platonism, you'll often hear the idea of something beyond being, right? The Henads, the gods or the one itself is beyond being. What does that mean? Well, they're beyond essence. So it's misleadingly translated into English as being, but it really means Ussia or essence, which has to do with like defining features of that thing. And it's not only defining features, but a set of defining features that is self-consistent and kind of self-grounding in a way, similar to the idea of an integrated information theory in, well, IIT, which is a modern theory of mind. I think it's basically the leading theory of consciousness out there. It's the one I subscribe to. And you can basically equivocate between an IIT and an Ussia. So it's a particular kind of structure that has ontological self subsistence. That's what a soul is. That's what forms have. And then beneath the level of soul, material things aren't IITs. They're not integrated information systems. They're incomplete and they're ontologically contingent on more fundamental realities. Those more fundamental realities being souls and then intellects slash forms and the one itself above it all. Yeah. So in this book, I'm reading Think and Beans. So he says that he thinks forms has kind of been badly translated. And he says that the ways used in the original Greek is very similar to a word like appearance. And that basically he's getting the forms there. He says that this word is used a lot in Aristotle and Plato, like the wattness of sensible things. So sensible objects are appearances. But it's like the reflection of Socrates. In a sense, you would say that is Socrates. But it's like a lesser reality than Socrates himself. And so as you move up levels of reality, you could go from like inorganic objects to creatures that have a consciousness, that have a level of intellect. And then you could go to humans that can think more abstractly. And so the hierarchy that presents itself in being is going to more intelligible forms of being. Basically, his argument is that the whole of classical philosophy, the basis for metaphysics at a certain point is to be intelligible and that there's no distinction between mind and reality. And so you don't get something like idealism or materialism. Because being is just that which appears in awareness, it appears in thoughts. So it's always an intelligible reality. It's always rational. And thinking is always thinking of being. He actually thinks that phenomenology lines up quite well with classical philosophy actually. But what I find interesting about it is, he basically says that this is what you need to understand as the whole basis for classical philosophy, Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Aquinas, that the whole basis for it is this idea that to be is to be intelligible, that there's no distinction between subject and object. So basically, he would place the beginning of modern nihilism at the rejection of this idea. And he says that it's one or the other. Either being is intelligible and to be is to be intelligible, or else you can't do metaphysics and you just have to be a skeptic and ultimately a nihilist. So he says the basis for nihilism is rejecting that certain point of to be is to be intelligible. So that's a very, you know, that's something I guess discussed a lot as well is like, what's the, you know, where did it all go wrong in the West kind of thing, these kinds of discussions of like, well, when did nihilism sit in, you know, was it Christianity? Was it Plato himself? Was it scientific revolution? And you kind of to very different perspectives when it comes to Platonism, because so in the case of Eric Pearl, who obviously respects Plato, he'd say that and that losing that starting point of the harmony between thinking and being that that gives you nihilism, because then you've no basis for any metaphysics or any objective claims. And the post liberal theologians who get discussed in these circles sometimes would say that, you know, with dynamicalism crisis, where we lost the sense of, we lost the belief in universals that once we abandoned that, that God became this kind of arbitrary thing, you know, you didn't really need God, because a lot of the justifications of classical metaphysics disappeared. And the idea that there was an objective good, you know, the good just became like completely contingent on God's will. But then it's like, when when you adopt that worldview, you kind of, you're kind of already adopting, you know, 90% of what is like a modern sort of relative worldview, but you just still have this entity of God, who has kind of an arbitrary will. And it's like, at a certain point, you know, you've no need of that extra hypothesis. So the post liberal sort of strand of thought that's quite popular now, especially among some of the Catholic intellectuals, is that, you know, nominalism, which is the same thing, kind of a rejection of Platonism, that that's the root of modern nihilism, and of the modern world. And then that's, that's completely contrasted with like, these sort of, oh, sorry, I'm getting a scout call right now. That's completely contrasted with like the Heideggerian view, which is basically that everything went wrong with Plato. And Plato was the beginning of modern nihilism. And it was precisely because of this attempt to kind of subdue reality and subject reality to thought and to reason. And as soon as we started doing that, it kind of, you know, it was the beginning of this kind of technical way of viewing reality where we try and, you know, we try and abstract it, we try and bend it to our will. And that we, you know, we should be approached in being more as a mystery, more as a poet than a philosopher. So you have two like diametrically opposed views that the problem is that we are presupposing this unity between intelligibility and reality versus, if you don't have that, the only option is nihilism. So yeah, I'm just kind of spitball now, but I'm just curious what you think of that kind of debate around the root of nihilism and what you think Platonism can tell us about that. Yeah, I sighed much stronger with the post-liberal theologians and I think the beginnings of nominalism, you know, like maybe a lot of the client of the West actually can be pinned on Peter Abelard and the fact that he couldn't like keep it in his pants and then also his disrespect of existing scholastic methods, you know, is kind of, and I wouldn't say that Peter Abelard was a full-on nominalist yet, but like I think in his conduct, in his life, you can see just a discontent, a desire to move beyond the limitations of his time and yeah, this like overwhelming hubris. So I think a lot of it comes down to moral failures, you know, it's not so much an intellectual current specifically, it's like there's always been this option available to people to reject Dharma, reject the law of their society as sacred and inviolable and to try to kind of cut their own path and use whatever sophistical justifications they can come up with to that effect. That's the behavior of a lot of the Sophists in the dialogues. So they were, there was already nihilism, you know, before nominalism and certainly before Plato. So you can't blame it as a phenomenon entirely on Plato. You also can't blame the rationalism entirely on Plato. With anything, Plato brought, I mean, Plato wasn't a rationalist. He completed a rational system that was around in his day and harmonized with it rather than like completely dismissing it, but then he went beyond it, beyond rationalism to kinds of mysticism, including mystic practice that guided the spiritual development of high antiquity, you know, for 800 years and led to the invention of mathematics, you know, building of Roman architecture. You don't have the academy and, you know, all this stuff. You don't have Archimedes. You don't have Roman engineering. You don't have all this beauty that we associated with the classical world. And Plato is responsible for that. He's not responsible for rationalism as such. And also, okay, Heidegger, like, what do you want exactly? Do you want us to see the efficacy of mathematics, see what it can actually do, and then just say, yeah, but it's a bad idea. Don't mess with it. That seems to be his approach to technology, generally, but it's like the philosophy of an ostrich, like putting your head in the sand and thinking that that'll allow you to kind of avoid the structural elements underlying reality that these rationalistic philosophers are trying to tease out. And certainly, that kind of rationalistic vein can lead to a feeling of alienation, but only if you hypothesize the wrong entities in your theories, you know, like materialism, hypothesizing crude matter and putting it as an ontological fundamental without even having a good definition of it, like that produces alienation, not through rationalism, but from a failure of establishing a well-grounded rational system philosophy. And I don't know a lot of Platonists who have, like, nihilistic tendencies, and you can't pin rationalism on Plato. There was already rational philosophy going on in the Eliatics with Pythagoreans, with the Ionians. So you can't just put it back in the bottle either. It's like, this is a mode of human consciousness that had an advantage in its time. You know, the Greeks didn't discover a lot of principles in astronomy, or even, I mean, they ended up discovering a lot of principles in geometry, but as of the 6th century BC, it was mainly the Egyptians responsible for knowledge in geometry, the Phoenicians responsible for knowledge in astronomy, and the Greeks emulated what they knew, but then found that, you know, there was no ground for that knowledge. The Egyptians grounded it in, you know, revelations from Toph, right? The Phoenicians were not sure how they grounded their knowledge in astronomy or whatnot, but, you know, it didn't work for the Greeks who didn't believe in the Phoenician gods. The Greeks, once they received this knowledge, practical, rational demonstrations, or sorry, rational tools, basically, from the Phoenicians and the Egyptians, they had to ground why they worked themselves, and they came up with this deductive method, and that's the distinguishing feature of Greek civilization. They systematized deduction, right? Aristotle gets credit for logic, but like dialectics, logic existed prior to Aristotle, and it's what led to what gave the Greeks their advantage, these new ways of thinking. It led to advantages in law, right? Plato was an innovator in law, his ancestor Solon was an innovator in law, partly because through their emphasis on deductive methods and like really analyzing justification in declarative speech, they just, you know, they moved to a new mode of thought, and it's not fair to pin that on Plato. Plato tried, once this new mode of thought emerged, he tried to harmonize it, he tried to put it in its proper context and use it, and like in our position today, you may not like technology, but if you just become, you know, a hermit in the woods, you're out of the game, you know, you're not going to do any good for the world just because you have this antipathy to technology, and that's mainly the way Heidegger seems to talk about it, and I haven't read Heidegger in years, but like neither Nietzsche nor Heidegger, in my opinion, offer like a substantive argument against anything that Plato's saying. At best, you get this kind of, but I don't like it point, which is ridiculous, and as far as like modern nihilism, you know, Nietzsche himself is responsible for a lot of people taking nihilistic turns, but mainly the nihilism in the modern world, I think. Partly it's nominalism, but partly it's just the failure of Christianity in our civilization, so we had a metaphysical foundation and it was lost, and now what goes in that hole? That's really the sort, that's where you get nihilism. People don't have a groundwork for morality. I think the average atheist, or just anyone who isn't a Christian, basically in our societies, if they say they're a moral realist, they probably don't even have very good arguments for it. You know, you need a system underlying your civilization to make sense of metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, what grounds claims, like all of this stuff needs to be there to have the whole moral structure operate, and like we undercut the foundation of our system, of our OS in the West, and so of course you're going to get nihilism. Blaming on Plato is just kind of ridiculous. Yeah, I think the high-deagorean critique could be applied to like Cartesian philosophy and a lot of modern metaphysics, but yeah, I really don't think it applies to like classical philosophy or medieval philosophy at all, because you know, that idea that it's like autonomous reason trying to subdue the world. Well, I mean the, you know, most of classical philosophy, like Platonism kind of ends up with a kind of apophatic, like ineffable source of being, you know, neo-Platonism kind of starts and ends in mysticism. You know, philosophy was considered the handmaiden of theology in the Middle Ages. You know, so the idea that like it's kind of speculative reason trying to present like a perfect sort of rational system of reality, again, I think that's like maybe a fair criticism of some modern rationalist philosophy, but I think if you try and put that back onto Plato, I think you kind of missed America. I think you're missing something that changed, you know, after Descartes and after the Scientific Revolution. So yeah, I think that misses America. And that's, again, I'd recommend that book by Eric Perlis. It's very expensive, it's drawn by a hard copy of it, but I'm sure you could find it, but you know, because he shows how, you know, a lot of these problems that we associate with modern nihilism and with the way that philosophy kind of lessens the world in terms of, you know, creating dualities like the mind and the world and subject object and kind of skepticism about epistemology. A lot of this was kind of solved by the platonic view of the world. And so yeah, the idea that metaphysics kind of inherently desacralizes the world. I don't think that's true at all. I think Platonism is is very much a counter to that. Maybe I'll just answer a couple of super chess just so we're not super pushed for time at the end if I read them. Sorry, one second. Hunter Stern said thoughts on Hennosis. Unification. Can you explain a bit what Hennosis is? Yeah, so the Hennads are the unities in, well, I think the distinction is first made explicit in Iambicus, but Proclus makes it a complete system. I have to explain a lot of, like, Proclus metaphysics here. I do incidentally have a roughly four and a half hour video describing every one of the propositions in Proclus' elements of theology. It's more condensed than reading it itself, but it's a bit tough. I'm in the process of editing it. But anyway, that might help some people get the full picture if they can put up with like four and a half hours of, you know, pre-scholastic Neoplatonism. But the idea for each realm or hypostasis of being, there is the one exemplar of that realm, and then this exemplar emanates imitations of itself. If it didn't produce the example, like the one itself, for example, if it didn't give off likenesses, then it would be inert and it wouldn't be as great as it could otherwise be. And for other arguments, we have to put goodness in the place of this kind of ontological first principle. And so in each category, you have like the prime intellect, for example. The hypostasis of intellect is also being life intellect. So the prime intellect is technically being itself, Lucia itself, the archetype of all Lucia. A lot of technical details in this that I probably don't need to go into. And then soul, there's like one RK of all souls, the monad of souls, and then a declension through imitation, through likenesses, moving into greater diversity and lesser powers. So in that first hypostasis of the one, the one gives off Henads, which are often equated with the Greek gods. And they are super essential. They're beyond intellectual definition. You know, this Eidos being translated from, or etymologically linked to the idea of a look, I think is appropriate. All of this can be interpreted phenomenologically, like Eric Pearl does. I think that is totally appropriate. But there's an element of phenomenological reality that is definitional, well-defined, intellectual, strictly speaking, formal. And then there's something beyond form, right? Form doesn't make sense unless form is contained in a transcendental unity. So unity is higher than the application of form. And so we were received through participation, our particular characteristics from the universals that we're partaking of at that level. So soul receives from hypostasis of intellect through participation. We receive unities, our unification of ourselves and unity with others through genosis, which is a higher energy than the energy of the forms, strictly speaking. Well, that's something I wanted to ask you, actually, about in terms of what's beyond the form. So what's the status of the good in Platonism? Is that kind of outside of the forms? I mean, that seems like one thing that there's an awful lot of debate about in terms of interpreting Plato. It seems like there's an awful lot of different interpretations of exactly what the good is and how it fits into his philosophy. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Sucipus, the direct successor to Plato in the Academy, seems to, and there are very fragmentary remains of his work, but he seems to have rejected the Platonic account of the one in the good being the first principle. Aristotle, when he talks about Plato's hidden doctrines, I think, includes the good and the one in the definition of that kind of first principle according to Plato. But I take, and when I read Plato and when I read Proclus, I mean, it's, Proclus justifies his positions in his commentaries extensively through quotation, and I mean, he's pretty compelling making his case that this is actually what Plato thought. So I lean towards like the Proclus was right school of Platonic interpretation. So yeah, the good is the same with the one. And this is informative for us because we can kind of define the nature of goodness through the nature of unification. Anecdotally, it kind of corresponds to what we think of as our well-being. Like someone is in a bad state mentally when they're at odds with themselves, when they have inner conflict, when they're not unified, cognitive dissonance is uncomfortable, whereas harmony and unification in the mind is positive, or our bodies suffer pain when they're disconnected. You know, if you tear a ligament, it's not a good feeling. If you're more well integrated, you allow yourself to heal, then you become more unific and better at the same time. So all union, qua union is a good because the good and the one are one, in my view, in the way that I see things. But yeah, that's above the form. So you have the good and the one, and then peros and apairon, or the principle of limit and unlimited, which are also super essential. And then you have the head adds, the species of unity, which are equated to the Greek gods often. And then you have the realm of being, life, intellect, the realm of forms in that second hypostasis. Okay, what about, you know, we hear about the, you know, the tree transcendental is true beauty goodness, but it seems like the good has a, an especially unique place and play those philosophy, but what about beauty then? So beauty isn't just beauty isn't is the form is that something forms as well. I believe. And so part of the system, like the general principle, once you want to accept, there are forms, you have to kind of put them in their proper taxonomy. And that's a lot of the work that neoplane necessary engaged with. So I can't remember where I read it, but somebody calls beauty like actually the chief form. I don't know about that. Exactly. I don't know precisely where to put this idea of beauty, but it's certainly in the rumble forms. Okay, that's interesting. Because there's also, I forget that it was at the Tabungan school, like there's there's this German school of interpretation of Plato that, you know, to summarize really simply, I guess they, they said that there's like, there was an unwritten doctrine of Plato that was preserved through some other people and that you can find from from oral accounts and so on. And if you put it together, basically, it looks remarkably similar to what we would call neoplatinism, like platinus. And if they're correct, then, you know, if you add in like the kind of oral teachings of what how Platinism was taught and the unwritten doctrines, then there's actually very little difference between Plato and platinus. So yeah, well, what do you think of that interpretation in terms of what we're missing from the dialogues that's kind of necessary to make sense of Plato's metaphysics that was likely there that we've missed? Yeah, I basically agree with that school of thought. When I read the dialogues before I had read neoplatinism, as I said before, I interpreted it in in terms of Advaita Vedanta, and I saw no real conflict there. So I mean, I do see Plato as a kind of monist, you know, maybe not, you might say he's like a qualified non-dualist, perhaps rather than like unqualified monism or monism, whatever. So yeah, platinus, I don't agree with on everything some of his doctrines. Proclus disagrees with, I tend to side with Proclus on those, like for example, platinus, when looking for a principle of evil, goes to matter itself. Whereas, you know, for Proclus, matter is the lowest entity ontologically, the most contingent, most dependent entity, least productive itself, but it's not a principle or archaic evil. For Proclus, there isn't an archaic evil. So platinus can lead to this more like mannequin view in some ways. So yeah, I mean, I would see platinus more as like an unqualified non-dualist. Proclus and Plato would be more, you know, qualified non-dualists. But I do see an essential continuity there, for sure. And again, like people, if you want to argue that Plato wasn't a Pythagorean, it just seems to me you can't have actually read through the dialogues. Because many of the characters who are most respected, Parmenides, Zeno influenced by Pythagoras, maybe not technically Pythagoreans themselves, but Timaeus in the Timaeus is Pythagorean. And then if you look at the roster of the first students in Aristotle schools, his school was effectively a Pythagorean school. I think the mainstream consensus among scholars is that Plato was a Pythagorean. And there was a Neo-Pythagorean tradition that kept running all the way through until the beginning of Neoplatonism. And there's also more continuity between Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism, I think, than many people suspect. It's just that not as many of the writings of the Middle Platonists survive. And I don't, I haven't gone through all of them, like I need to read Plutarch's Moralia, which isn't all about morals. A lot of it actually has to do with, like, more Platonic cosmology and metaphysics. So I'm curious what, you know, I respect Plutarch's sense of style, at least, from his biographies. But yeah, he had some Platonic doctrines to relate to his own in his day. So I, yeah, I think an unbroken line of Pythagorean slash Platonic influence is the way to interpret these philosophies, their antiquity. Although, yeah, there were innovations in Neoplatonism. But there's so much in the dialogues that it's often possible to kind of go back and interpret even things that seem to be very late additions, you know, like this dichotomy between the one and the hen ads, but within the first hypostasis, like that's a kind of proto-scholastic fine distinction that doesn't seem to be there in Plato. But, you know, if you read carefully enough, like Proclas tends to, maybe you can see a justification. So I would say overarching continuity with some development, especially in late antiquity. All right, I want to ask you as well about Plato's conception of God. So obviously, in the Tamaeus, he puts forward this idea of a demiurge that created the world according to mathematical principles, but it's not the kind of God of classical theism, right? He's a creator God, you know, he has a bit more agency. It's not the kind of ultimate transcendent sort of apophatic being that we might be used to Platonists, you know, how to describe God in theology. So is there like two gods in Plato? Is there the demiurge and a more sort of transcendent classical conception of God? Or, you know, is the good something that is kind of above God in that sense as the ultimate principle? Or, you know, are we to understand that as it relates to like classical theism? Right, if we're going to go with Proclas again, then there will be a relationship of the one and the good to the Greek gods that equates to the relationship between the monad of like, say, triangularity to all particular triangles. So the monad of Henads is the one itself, and that because of that, we can call that the first God. Proclas does in the elements of theology, call the one itself the first God. So in that way, you could say, I know, Proclas would identify as a polytheist, but you kind of say there's a cult monotheism there. But anyway, so you have that kind of divinity beyond participation, pure unity. Like, and things don't directly participate of the one, they participate via intermediaries, the one remains in itself, never affected by what's outside of it, but containing everything outside of it, always from eternity, emanating out copies of itself. And then we participate of those unities. Now, the demiurge is at a lower level. He's not even the summit of the second hypostasis, which is being as such, the chief among intelligibles. And being has to be superior to intellect, because intellect aims at particular beings. Intellect isn't like, it only makes sense if it has a target. And because something that is aimed at a target is subordinate to its end, right, it is trying to get to its end, it can't be the ultimate thing. So intellect is not ultimate. In that second hypostasis, being that the principle being being itself is is preeminent. But so you have the principle being the principle of life, and then the principle of intellect. And that that member of this, this set here would be where you find the demiurge as such. And his peculiar feature is that he's the intelligible intellect. So within intellect, you have a spectrum of the chief intellect, and then subordinate imperfect, less complete intellects declining from there. In the demiurge himself, his objects of intellection, what he's looking at with his intellect is one in the same with his essence. So he contains all the forms in in himself, all intellects contain all forms, but in different ratios. So like the form of, I don't know, say a triangle again, or whatever, will contain in some sense, seminally, all the other forms, but it will emphasize the one that is its peculiar identity. What's unique about the demiurge is that he contains all the forms unfiltered in himself. And his act of creation is also kind of similar to the way that the one creates. He remains in himself. And through his self contemplation, generates these likenesses that then as intermediaries kind of do his work. So there's actually not just one demiurge. There's a whole series of demiurgic intellects, which engage in the fabrication of the world in Platonism, or according to Proclus at least. So yeah, it's so in some ways, like the demiurge in Proclus looks like God in Aristotelianism, you know, for Aristotle, God is thought thinking itself, and that is kind of what the demiurge is. It's the prime intellect as such, reverting to itself, and intellect is an essentially revered function in each of these, just to kind of complexify it a little bit more, in each of these hypostases, there is abiding, progressing, and reverting necessarily. So each moan out of a series, for example, abides in itself, progresses to its last members, and reverts to itself. So intellect in the being life, intellect hypostasis is the revered function. Being is abiding, life proceeds, proliferates, differentiates, and then intellect in gathers and brings back, you know, what was disseminated. So the demiurge is that chief of the revered, revered of function in gathering everything in the realm of forms, and then through that kind of emanates the lower realms of reality beneath himself as his product. Yeah, the, the idea of like, positing two gods or two natures of God is actually, you actually see it crop up again and again, like, again, Alfred North Whitehead theorized that there was like an imminent and a primordial nature to God, that there was a, you know, God as he acts in the world, and sort of directs, you know, the concrescence of the world versus the God that kind of, because Whitehead kind of was a Platonist, he's presented as like a process philosopher, but really I see this like updated Platonism, but you know, then he had the primordial aspect of God that he needed to pause it to like uphold the, what he called them, eternal objects, which are basically his version of Platonic forms. But it's kind of, maybe this is, you could tell me if this is a good analogy, but you know, in Hinduism and Vedanta, they have the idea that, you know, there's Brahman, which is obviously the complete ineffable source of everything that, you know, apophatic descriptions apply to, but then as it concerns the world, Vedanta actually has like a kind of a second God, which is more like the kind of personal, theistic creator God that they call Ishvara, and they say that, yeah, that you have to have, you know, that that's basically Brahman's interaction with the created world, like somehow generates this like absolute mind. So would you say it's a fair analogy that like Demiurge is like Ishvara and Vedanta, and then the Platonic idea of the one is, you know, could be equated with like the Hindu idea of Brahman? Yeah, unqualifiable, yes. Okay, that's interesting. And another thing is, would you say then that the, from a Platonic conception of things, does the good have any creative power? Like, I know that might sound like a weird question, but I've been, I've been reading this book. It's very interesting called Universes by John Leslie. I don't know if you're familiar with it. But he basically argues for a modern version of the defined union argument, which I do find very convincing. You know, just take a modern physics, things like the cosmological constant. And you know, I'm sure you're familiar with like the kind of modern updated version of it. But then at the end, it's kind of interesting. So he's not committed to any religion. But he thinks the fine tune in argument basically is a convincing argument for God. And it's a much better argument to multiple universes. But then at the end, there's an interesting chapter where he's speculating, well, okay, what, what created this? And he says that he finds the Platonic answer the best. But the way he presents it is that the universe came into existence because it was an ethical good that it would exist. So that's, I mean, that's kind of a, the way we're used to thinking in Western philosophy, I think that's kind of a, that kind of hits you as a very left of field idea that somehow something being good itself, like gives itself creative power, like because it was good that the universe would exist. That goodness itself created the universe. It's a very strange idea, but he says that this is like a platonic conception of the good. So yeah, I'm just curious what you think of that. Hmm. These arguments, like, basically pre Anselm ontological arguments are found in Neoplatonism. I don't, I've never really liked ontological arguments. I do side with Schopenhauer on that. So it's, it's difficult. You know, in some ways, I'm kind of like getting into Neoplatonism just in the last two years. I read Plato, you know, many years ago, I've always considered myself a Platonist, but I never really took the literature seriously and tell more recently. So I can't, I can't speak like in specificity on, on precisely that point. But I mean, does Plato suggest that the good has some, has some creative power? Like, is it just this, you know, because when you think of the good, it's this kind of static, you know, unchanging. But the idea that it could have like creative power to generate the universe, Leslie calls that a Platonic idea. That's a, it's a very different way of thinking about that, isn't it? Yeah, I mean, there is, there is talk of like the generation from the one in the good. The question is like, how do you justify that argument? Right? One argument that Proclas makes is similar to a kind of ontological argument where, you know, once we've identified the first principle as the good, and his, I could go through his arguments for why, but they're a little bit convoluted. But anyway, once you get that identity of the first principle, then okay, what is better, something being inert and static, or something overflowing itself and having abundant infinite powers? Well, clearly the latter, right? Appealing toward intuitions. So I haven't really seen like an excellent argument on that point. I have my own way of thinking about it, which has always been like the kind of ultimately permedean, more this is where the monism really comes in or monism comes in, where the one is inconceivable unless it subsumes the rest of reality anyway. And then the description of reality being emanated out of it is really just a factor of like limitations and separations being temporarily imposed through perspectives on this one, so that you're never outside of the one, the one has to contain everything. But in another manner of speaking, we can say it has to overflow itself and create likenesses of itself. But like a pure one, a pure simplicity is inconceivable outside of the categorical distinctions that we use to arrive at the notion of simplicity, like the simplicity, complexity, dichotomy is built into our minds. And so we can't think simplicity without complexity. And so you can't put forward a hypothesis of the first principle of being that is this perfect simplicity with nothing else involved. No matter what, you're always kind of just leaving unspoken the rest of the categorical schema of like what exactly defines it as simplicity. Pure simplicity is completely ineffable, completely unthinkable, and doesn't make sense logically. But if you take this step to say that like everything is the same as simplicity at some level, a kind of holographic containment where complete undifferentiation is always and only at the same time, like all all differentiation smushed into one. All differentiation has to be the same as the undifferentiated in a kind of paradoxical way. So this is obviously we're dealing with the very summit of, I would say being, but that's not strictly speaking correct, platonic terms, the highest level of reality. And so in mystical systems, in perennialist systems, there's always antinomy, seeming paradox, seeming contradiction because we've run up against the limits of dynoia, rationalistic thinking. We can't touch that element of reality through abstractions because they are inherently categorical, inherently relational. And so you can't express simplicity through relation, through a relational medium. The only mode of contact would have to be intuitive, which is why like the knowledge of this reality can only ever come down to us rationalistic philosophers from those who through through theology or yoga or whatever have made contact with that more unitive ineffable aspect of reality. So does it make sense to say that? I mean, does it make sense to ask why the forms exist? Like is there any level of contingency or are they just absolutely necessary? Because like take like modern Christians, right? Like, I think William Land Craig argues that he believes in, you know, abstract objects, that numbers exist. But he thinks that it's a itself kind of an argument for the existence of God, but he also says that these wouldn't exist without God creating them, without God creating the laws of logic and numbers and so on, because he says that it's like it's a terrible limitation on God if you say that these, you know, numbers and abstract objects and stuff are absolutely necessary. Because, you know, that's that's there themselves kind of constraining God then. So like what's kind of a standard traditional like plateness take on that? Like would Plato have said the, would you have ever speculated about like why the forms exist? Or would a plateness say that that's kind of a meaningless question? No, I don't think it'd be meaningless. I think they why they exist, you can easily justify on epistemological grounds, like theoretically, we have to postulate these entities to make sense of what we see. But like the bigger question of why they are there, you have to go to the higher principles beyond the forms have to be prolific themselves, or they would be not as good as they could otherwise be. So again, it's this kind of variety variation on the ontological argument that people keep falling back on here, which I'm not totally happy with. But I think one way of thinking of it is just that because creation from the one happens through similitude likenesses of himself, the forms inevitably reflect the nature of that kind of divine reality in itself. So it's not it's not a matter of God kind of with like libertarian free will selecting, you know, how he's going to make the world. It's rather just the world and the forms are just an overflowing of divine power and are an expression of his nature. And so they're not arbitrary. They are the necessary ways that being must unfold. And that's like that raises kind of the ultimate metaphysical question that you could ask, you know, is ultimate reality necessarily one way? And does some being or super essential reality exert some kind of will over what the nature of that possible realm of being would be? For me, like, if if that's what you do, then you're nominalist, and ultimately, like, you're not going to be able to have rationalistic framework, you can always take that step theoretically. But the worldview that comes out of that won't have the same advantages that a worldview based on necessity has. And, you know, necessity just in Greek mythology, and in most traditional mythological systems is placed above the gods. So the way that the forms are the way all these subordinate levels are have to just be reflections of the nature of the divine ultimately. All right, I'm going to get to some more to super chats. George Wright said, when translated and played with Christianity, does the one correspond to the father and Logos, the son? Logos, Jesus is Logos in the Christian interpretation, isn't he? Yes. Yes. I don't know about the father as one of you. No. I mean, if anything, the father in Judaic theology is more like the Demiurge, yes. And Logos, I mean, the Logoi are principles within soul, like Eidos is the formal principle in the realm of forms. Logos is, I think, peculiar to the level of soul, but I could be wrong on that. It's kind of a technical point. Just actually seen as that came up, the Demiurge, the Old Testament. So how influential was Platonism on Gnosticism? Did they get the idea of the Demiurge direct from Plato? Yes, for sure. Of course, like the pessimism of the Gnostics, they did not take from Plato. Plato was really, I think, more like Leibniz, where Leibniz thought that we have the best of all possible worlds, very anti-Schopenhauer in that way, or not in line with Schopenhauer's views. But yeah, the world denying isn't really there in Plato. I mean, he acknowledges that there are better places to go, but he also acknowledges that the world is a beautiful place and is created by it. Plotinus wrote a big screen against the Gnostics, didn't he? Yeah, right, which I haven't read in a long time. But yes, so I do think they got that idea, the Gnostics did. Also, it deserves mentioning it's this guy, Russell Gmerkin, has a very interesting hypothesis about the origin actually of the Old Testament as we've received it. Sorry, what's that name, Russell? Russell Gmerkin, G-M-I-R-K-E-N, I think. So apparently, there isn't a shred of archaeological or textual or cultural evidence at all of the Old Testament prior to 270 BC. And that's when the Septuagint Bible is translated. The translators of the Septuagint Bible were Hellenized Jews living in Alexandria. They translated it in the Library of Alexandria where there were obviously tons of Hellenistic texts, including Plato. And Gmerkin just kind of traces all of these parallels between conventions in Greek literature, Greek legal conventions, like the idea of a constitution is uniquely Greek. The ancient, like the Code of Hammurabi is there as a set of laws, but Near Eastern societies didn't invent the Constitution. And yet there are constitutional elements in the Old Testament and in Greek law, and then also like particular prescriptions that Plato offers in the laws, especially in the Republic. And it just looks like the people who translated the Sanhedrin Bible were actually drawing from a set of their traditional scriptures and put it together in line with Hellenistic philosophy and especially the advice of Plato, which if true would be hugely significant. I mean obviously, I think Gmerkin has a couple interviews on YouTube and I've read some of his more recent, he has two books on this, I read some of the more recent book. And it's definitely an interesting hypothesis. Well, Nietzsche said Christianity was Platonism for the masses. So if Gmerkin is correct, then that was doubly true. Yeah, that's interesting. And then when the Gnostics criticized the Christians, or sorry, when the Neoplatonists criticized the Christians for being a historical, well actually, it might be because the Jews themselves invented this fake history on the advice of Plato, as he says in the Republic, you have to believe that your institutions are ancient, etc. And that's what the Jews who followed Plato's advice did. And so that would be like the whole Testament, like back to Moses and Abraham. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there would be certain scriptures that already existed, like the Book of Job, most people think is actually ancient from like 11th century, or sorry, 11th, you know, 11th century BC, or thereabouts, there are precedents in Near Eastern literature from the 800s, 700s, the lament literature that like the genre looks similar to the Book of Job. But yeah, as far as the system goes that Pentateuch the Mosaic Law, all of this stuff, and it fits with the higher criticism, like the author that's called like the Deuteronomist, who's the latest author who really puts together like the Deutero canonical formalization, and that system of law that would have been under Gomerkin's hypothesis created during this translation of the Septuagint around 270 BC. Right, that's very interesting. Yeah, I've bookmarked his Wikipedia, so I'll definitely check that out. Hunter Stern said thoughts on the Straussian hermeneutic of Plato. I don't know Strauss, so. Yeah, Strauss has this interpretation that, you know, you have to have like an esoteric interpretation of every philosopher, because they have to write in a way that doesn't, that Plato came to this realization with Socrates that, you know, you have to present version of your philosophy that won't upset the social order, and then one that can be read esoterically. But I haven't read a lot of Strauss readers, so I can't really say it that much. I mean, I agree with that. There's definitely the esoteric divide and Platonism. Yeah, he thinks that's like, he also thinks there's an esoteric message in Plato, like specifically about that, you know, as discussions of Socrates and stuff, like the role of the philosopher as it pertains to the social order and trying to translate truth in that context. But yeah, again, I haven't read a lot of Strauss, I can't really say anything too interesting on it. Eton Vac said, Ervol speaks a lot about Platonic metaphysics, forms, etc. Okay, this is quite a big question. One, how do you assess Plato's political philosophy strictly? Two, how much is Plato's political philosophy grounded in his metaphysics? And, well, I guess you can answer those first, and then I'll ask the other one, because it's kind of unrelated. Yeah, Plato's political philosophy, it's kind of surprising we didn't cover that at all, actually, but right. Yeah, there's a relationship known for, yeah. Right, yeah, yeah. So the relation to his metaphysics, that's quite an interesting angle as it concerns his philosophy. Right, I mean, they're obviously intimately connected. I am a Platonist politically as well, and Plato was an authoritarian. Basically, it's one big endorsement of paternalism. There is a hierarchy of souls, some souls know better. And if you don't know as well as someone else, like you should follow the people who know. Everyone's, this is like a proceless idea, everything's proper perfection is to be found by following, like in the train of its whatever leads back to its proper cause. So the world is filled with these intermediary authorities that we always have to be appealing to, to integrate ourselves into a broader hierarchy. And I think that's basically the way and the model and the path. And I think in the 21st century, especially it's going to become more obvious that you can't have libertarianism culturally. You have to have some degree of paternalism. Now, there is a harmony that you can find between libertarianism and this more authoritarian paternalistic way, which is like, you can have independent kind of volunteerist societies that themselves internally operate on authoritarian lines. And that's ultimately the way that I go. But yeah, I don't really disagree with Plato at all. The Republic is meant to be like an absolute ideal. There's a couple of things we know about the way he thought about this ideal state. One is that it corresponds to some kind of ideal form archetype of political society that is there to be found by anyone. So Plato wouldn't have thought of himself as inventing this system, but rather discovering like the true, most true dharma of a society like his own. But then there's also a chart, sorry, just bear with me one moment here. Yeah, there. So it's an ideal, it's also in the Timaeus, we learn exactly the constitution and structure of ancient Athens. So in the Atlantis narrative, Athens defeats the Atlantean Empire. And part of why it's able to do that is because it had this best of all possible models of the state handed down directly by Athena. So it's given by the gods. It's also a form, perfect mode of government. And, you know, some of the particulars you could argue were having to do with the technology of this time and place. But by and large, the process is, I think, what needs to be there in political society, which is you need to get talent very early on, standardize certain aspects of education, especially like music, gymnastics, mathematics, like what we've basically done. Like a lot of philosophy of education over the centuries its origin to Plato's philosophy of education, and of Athens more broadly. You know, a lot of what Plato recommends in the Republic is just like, do what Athens does and this and this additional stuff. So yeah, I mean, I would consider myself a Platonist, basically, and it's tied to the metaphysics because that's what the guardians have to do. They have to be able to make contact once they've studied their mathematics, completed the rationalistic philosophy, learned all the mundane principles of government. Then, you know, when they're 55 and up, and they're at the real head of the hierarchy, they can like make make that intuitive contact with the forms, you know, come to know the perfect state directly, and then come back down into the cave into the political society and enforce that. And unless for Plato, you have this caste, spiritually enlightened caste that can return to the higher realm in some form and, you know, make contact with that guiding principle or formal principle of society, then it'll break down. So they're definitely connected. All right, and the second part of that question was just, have you encountered tropes nominalism? No. Okay, yeah, I'm not very familiar with either. Just one other thing on that actually, again, it's quite a big question. But I mean, in terms of the Plato's approach to political philosophy versus Aristotle, I mean, what would you say is, is the main difference there? Is it that Plato is more focused on, like, the perfect ability of people through the state in a way that Aristotle isn't, you know, he's more taken the kind of family is a starting unit, would you say that's a fair characterization? Plato certainly has more hope for the perfect ability of man, but people mischaracterize that and take it in this kind of communist or like new socialist man way in thinking that like everybody's going to be transformed. And Plato knows that's not happening. Obviously, this is for the elite. It's for a small segment of the population to actually overcome these kind of egoistic limitations of everyday life and and make a difference. But anyway, Aristotle, I've read his politics, but I'm trying to kind of remember like where where he really situates like the highest form of government. I know he ranks, I mean, his ranking is similar to that of Plato from the Republic. But do you recall like does he put aristocracy on top still? I don't know that he really like fundamentally disagrees. All that might mean he gets the idea like man is a social animal, you need this larger community, but that also it follows right in line with what Plato talks about in the Republic. You know, maybe there's more emphasis on kinship, but also Plato, like if bare minimum, people need to believe that they all spring from the same ground, you know, they do have this blood and soil connection. So that's important mythologically for Plato, even if not like if it doesn't always have to be ethnographically true, for example, like the Athenian tribes were legal fictions and people more or less knew that. And yet Plato would endorse such tribal divisions, even if they don't come from an organic source, they can still be useful for the state. Yeah, so I don't know, I would have to reread the politics to really make a robust comparison. All right. Hunter Stern said, is there any difference between Dugan and Urban Crystal both have their start in politics with their own strand of Bolshevism, then through a schizo hermeneutic of Plato and onto influence politics? Well, they're political views are obviously quite a bit different, I would say. Sovereign Air said, you don't need to watch a video called the Athenian Revolt Against Babylonian Finance. I linked it, I think it's by that channel that used to be around vertical politics. Promise you won't be disappointed with the quality. He's one of the best creators, not as official channel. All right, well, I'll check that out. But yeah, that's all the superchats. Yeah, did you have any other topic regarding Plato you wanted to cover? I mean, I think basically, like the challenge for people is if you don't want to accept the theory of forms to explain how universals work, then you have a lot of other work to do in really making a robust nominalist system. I know that a lot of other professional philosophers are nominalists. I just don't think anyone can be a nominalist coherently. That's my case. That's what I defend. So a lot of it does come down to the theory of the forms, the idea of universals, what is the first principle of being? If it's not unity, if you don't go with Plato there, and you don't take that kind of monism, then what's your first principle? The question is like, here's this system. It is acted as the foundation of Western philosophy for more than 2000 years. People have built off it in thousands of different ways in different ages. And so if you're going to just say no to it, okay, man, now it's your turn. Now it's your turn to build this system that's going to work for us as a foundation. And I don't see anybody coming up with anything like that. If perennialism is essentially true, there is one true philosophy, then you should expect the majority of the traditions out there will always be guided by a similar kind of basic set of beliefs. You see that in Hinduism, in Platonism, you see that hints of it in what we can gather of Indo-European philosophy. There are regional differences, of course, but I think that the basic truth, metaphysically speaking, of the world is there, and it's one. There is one truth of the world. If you say Plato got it wrong, then what do you put in its place? And like a reference to its flux or its ineffable or unknowable, that can remain a bare assertion, but it doesn't amount to a comprehensive worldview. And there are plenty of scientific Platonists who have integrated modern theories, like there are Platonists working today, integrating quantum mechanics, integrate information to people like Johanna Rottz, who I respect. I know that you know about these people are out there doing the work to build the new system that, you know, the equivalent of what Aquinas did in the Middle Ages, the equivalent of what Plato and Aristotle did in antiquity. And yeah, there's just literally no alternative. So we've just read through the Elcibiades, and I think the basic point that is made there is, on the one hand, the nature of the soul. Where is our identity fundamentally situated? Do we benefit ourselves by benefiting the body? Do we benefit ourselves by acquiring power? What's that kind of first principle? What do you do first? Like even if we agree that political power is good. Elcibiades, of course, is Athenian statesman. Bronze Age pervert mentioned him in his book, Bronze Age mindset, as this Athenian statesman who like had influence in Athens, and then when they were going to arrest him at a certain point in time, defected to Sparta. And then from Sparta, well, he impregnated the wife of the king in Sparta. And so he had to leave and he defected to the Persians. And then from the Persians, he redefected to the Athenians who wanted him back because they thought like, wow, based, that's cool. And so he went back and then was kicked out again, and then eventually died in Turkey somewhere. So but he was like, you know, very guided by Thumos, very like martial spirit kind of character. And he wanted on his like 18th birthday, as soon as he was given full legal privileges in the state of Athens, he wanted to go into the assembly and like tell him what was what and what they ought to be doing with the state. And the whole dialogue is Socrates basically just saying, whoa, calm down, like, first of all, what are you advising the Athenians on? What do you know better than them that you can inform them on? And these are the sorts of questions that I think many people who operate in political spheres don't actually fundamentally ask themselves, you know, what do I know better about how the state should be run? People presume that they know better, but often they leave these fundamental notions like justice, like advantage, like what is the soul, like these sorts of things, they leave them completely unanswered. And this approach of like starting in the middle with philosophy and starting with common notions and indefinable, you know, je ne sais quoi that is your identity and movement. Like, that's not been demonstrated to work. Historically, it's this Platonist approach, what Socrates advocates for Alcibiades like, no, first, take care of your own virtue, get grounded yourself, and learn the nature of reality. And then maybe you'll be in a position to to advise the Athenians and, you know, exert your influence on their on the Empire. But step one is like, Okay, prepare yourself. And I think Plato's solution ultimately is very clear. It clearly worked. It was building a school. And I think we we are in a similar position. We should do similar things. So yeah, I'm doing my reading group. We just finished Alcibiades. We're moving on to the Gorgias, starting April 16. We meet on Saturdays. People can join through the Patreon by recognizing that not everybody you can support it doesn't work for some people situation. So I have made quite a few exceptions for people. So basically, whoever wants to get involved, you can contact me on Skype or just join the Patreon, and I'll send you a link and explain how it works and stuff. But it's it's kind of just required reading. Like if you want to be more than just a commenter on current events, like if you really take the truth seriously, you want to have this holistic worldview. And I don't think our side, generally speaking, can win unless we have this comprehensive worldview supporting us, like you have to at least match the kind of thing the elites have produced. And by the way, the elites got way where they are by relying on their knowledge of Plato, they read Plato, you probably should do like it's kind of required reading if you want to have this comprehensive worldview, if you want to get to the bottom of things, get to the bottom of our civilization, all of this, you're going to have to do it one way or another. So you might as well deal with others. The dialogues can be a little bit difficult to read. There's often many layers of meaning that get lost. You know, I'm often kind of blown away by some of the Neoplatonic commentators when they like, excuse me, explicate a metaphor that is there in like the setting of a dialogue, for example, and I just had no, no cognizance of it the first time reading through. So there's a lot in these texts, you know, they not only found provided the foundation of Judaism, Christianity, some of Islam, also Hermeticism, ancient occult traditions, Renaissance magics, like all occult traditions from Rosicrucianism to Masonry, like Mason still talk about Pythagoras and Plato, the all of these people who have controlled the world have built what they've built off of the back of Plato. So even if you want to reject it, fine, first read through it. So, you know, I encourage people with dissenting opinions also to get in contact with me. If you think I'm totally wrong, then let's have a conversation about it, you know, take our time and really analyze what's being said, because kind of a motive just reacting against Plato, because like Heidegger doesn't like Plato or whatever is just kind of childish, let's grow up and get our foundation set for putting ourselves in the best path to victory, ideally. Yeah, your Ereval's channel link is in the description, so if you want to get in contact with them, I think you post your Skype and other links and stuff in the video so people can find you through there. Actually, one thing, the guy who asked about the difference between Irving Crystal and Dugan, there is actually a debate that's been done around again lately, where Dugan actually debated Bernard Henri Levy, who has a very similar worldview to Irving Crystal, he's like a big apologist for neoliberalism and neo-conservatism, so you could just watch that debate if you want to see the differences in worldview. But yeah, just one other thing actually, I mean, I know you, as far as, you know, what you mentioned about the school and you think that we need to do something similar today in terms of bringing the best minds together, creating like a comprehensive, coherent worldview, certain metaphysics that has like scientific insights. If I understand you right, you think that an advantage of this is basically, you know, who kind of wins in the social space is kind of decided by technological, scientific advances, you know, that's kind of how liberalism came to power. Like one question I have is like, you know, as far as that goes, I mean, if you were to bring kind of the best scientific minds together and get a, you know, an excellent sort of theory of everything, isn't there a problem in the modern world that like to translate that into power now requires such a massive sort of military industrial complex behind you. Like when, you know, the more things progress, like, you know, one time you could make a great scientific discovery with a telescope, right, or a math equation, but now the way things are progressing, you need like the large hadron collider for like billions of dollars, whatever that costs, and like a huge team of hundreds of scientists. So I don't know, that's a, that was a question actually in terms of like, you know, does having the truth, or does having a scientific insight really translate into power today if you don't have a huge state apparatus behind you to create a huge industrial apparatus to, you know, carry out experiments and turn that actually into technology that could make any difference. Right. Well, on the one hand, it depends on exactly what this new philosophy worldview scientific paradigm looks like, because if it allows us to rediscover the lost Atlantean acoustic limitation, you know, whatever they were using, then maybe it's something that's practical for people. That's obviously a stretch. But I think the more like direct path to victory by having an institution like this is using it as a framework for communities to build new kinds of production chains. So rather than trying to like build the new high tech thing, you have to be vertically integrated and you have to start from the ground up. So you get this society together with the right worldview, and then you organize intelligently in paternalistic ways, and build out the production chains gradually. So the direct application of this worldview is as an operating system for a social structure. And then you scale that social structure by better management, by affordability, by offering like tangible material benefits to people who joined your paradigm. And then gradually you have more communities involved, you have more people cooperating in your system. And then the end product of that is some of this more high tech stuff that requires, you know, more capital investment. But I think the worldview doesn't, it's not that the direct output has to be the side beam cannon, right? That's like, there have to be several steps before you get to that, that end artifact. So yeah, if you have the right worldview, you can align values, you can get people cooperating, and then simply recruit, scale, and repeat until you have the resources you need to do whatever else you want to do. All right. Yeah, well, we're coming up to two hours, 40 minutes. Yeah, I really enjoyed this talk. It was great to get you on. Like I said, I'm kind of immersed myself in Platonism again. And I feel like, kind of feel like I'm starting from scratch, because yeah, if you really get into it, you can realize that there's there's a lot of things you kind of took for granted, or you kind of gloss over some of the ancient philosophers, I definitely did. You know, you kind of like, well, my experience anyway, no, I found the just you feel like you there's like a sort of obligatory, like summary reading of them that you have to do. And you just get the basics of them. And that's kind of it. So I found looking at like secondary literature. And like I said, I really recommend that book by Eric Pearl. You realize that it is actually a completely different way of approaching philosophy, a completely different way of thinking about the world. And you actually have to like set aside all your sort of modern prejudices in how you think about the world and how you approach questions about reality. And it's actually, you know, it has its own kind of feeling and logic to it. But then once you imbibe that, you realize that, you know, it's such a radically different way of doing things. And it really does solve a lot of modern problems. So yeah, I think people should take an early look at Platonism and Ereval's channel is very good. I also shared, I know you promote them, you interview them. I shared this channel on my Telegram. I'm forgetting the name, is it like E.C. Winsper? Yes, that's it. E.C. Winsper. Yeah, I recommend that channel as well. And you can find Ereval's interview with them where they have another discussion about Plato. But yeah, thanks for joining me, Ereval. I appreciate it. Thanks for everyone that tuned in, sent super chats. And yeah, potentially, I'll be back next week.
