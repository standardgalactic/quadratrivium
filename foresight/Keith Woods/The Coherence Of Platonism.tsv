0	6400	Alright everyone, so today I want to talk about this book called Platonism and Naturalism,
6400	10840	The Possibility of Philosophy, by the Platonist scholar Lloyd Gerson.
10840	16680	Now this is an interesting book to cover because this actually presents a very good introduction
16680	24080	to Platonism, you know, Platonism as it's thought in sort of introductory courses and
24080	27280	colleges and so on.
27280	29960	We don't really get a full perspective on Platonism, right?
29960	35360	We get what's sort of in the dialogues, you know, the Republic and Plato's ideal form
35360	38280	of government and the forms and so on.
38280	43640	But the kind of Platonism Gerson presents is, you know, Platonism as it was a school
43640	44640	of thought.
44640	49080	So, as well as what's in the dialogues, you know, there is a deeper sort of more esoteric
49080	56600	reading of the dialogues and of Plato that includes Plato's so-called unwritten doctrine
56680	62080	as it was taught to Platonists, it includes the testimony that Aristotle gave of what
62080	64080	Plato believed.
64080	69120	Plato also had a number of epistles where he further explained some of the sort of more
69120	73800	esoteric elements of his thought and then of course there's the whole school of Platonism
73800	80800	or what we call neo-Platonism, people like Plotinus and Proclus and that's often presented
80800	83600	as kind of a separate school of philosophy, right?
83600	84600	It's neo-Platonism.
85080	89440	Something like Gerson would say, no, this is just Platonism and what usually separates
89440	94360	them is, again, you know, Platonism we think of the forms, the separate forms, this world
94360	101360	of forms and we think of neo-Platonism as this more kind of religious philosophy where
101360	107120	the one is very central and it's this kind of mystical view of the world where everything
107120	109400	unfolds from the one.
109480	115720	Well Gerson argues that this was always central to Platonism, that central to Plato's philosophy
115720	121280	is what he calls the superordinate idea of the good or the one and that Plato's whole
121280	126520	philosophy is really built around this and a lot of scholars kind of missed this point
126520	130200	and they have a much more sort of exoteric reading of Plato.
130200	136480	Now this book is interesting because Gerson, as well as presenting the whole outline of
136520	142720	the Platonist philosophy and given this deeper reading of Platonism, he actually argues that
142720	149720	when we understand Platonism this way we begin to see that essentially philosophy is a kind
149840	156840	of binary choice between Platonism and naturalism and we can actually read the whole history
157920	163600	of Western philosophy as this conflict between Platonism and naturalism because what Gerson
163600	170000	argues is that this whole system of Platonism, it all fits together, the key elements of
170000	175680	it inform the elements and if any one of those isn't possible then philosophy itself isn't
175680	181080	possible because without the Platonist viewpoint philosophy basically wouldn't have anything
181080	186720	to tell us and we would just be limited to what science can tell us about the world.
186720	193080	Now to back this up Gerson starts this book with a cover in Richard Rorty who's quite
193080	198600	a well-known post-modernist philosopher and he's a good background to this because Rorty
198600	204120	basically argued the same thing and philosophy in the mirror of nature, he argues that Platonism
204120	210620	and philosophy are identical because if one rejects Platonism one has no specific knowledge
210620	216320	to contribute. If you reject the tenets of Platonism you really can't claim that philosophy
216320	221480	can tell us anything unique about the world. Although philosophers from Aristotle onward
221480	227800	made philosophical criticisms of Plato, Rorty claims that they did so from a Platonic starting
227800	233600	point they shared with Plato basic assumptions of principles, the questioning of which was
233600	238720	never the starting point of any objection and so it is possible to read all of classical
238720	244480	philosophy as this kind of dialogue within Platonism. Aristotle is a Platonist, of course
244480	249160	you have the Neoplatonist when you have Christian philosophers, scholastics like Aquinas, they
249200	254560	too are starting from these kind of Platonist starting points. Rorty maintained that the
254560	260480	fundamental divide between Platonists, whether this is self-declared or not, and anti-Platonists
260480	265720	is that the former believed that it's possible to represent truth in language and thought
265720	270400	whereas the latter do not. Rorty is known for this book Philosophy in the Mirror of
270400	276920	Nature and this is basically his argument, the argument of the post-modernist is that
277040	284040	our thought can't accurately represent truth and that there's a fundamental divide between
285120	290800	these and this is his rejection fundamentally of Platonism. Rorty says that Platonic thought
290800	297320	is systematic, that is it believes it has a distinct subject matter. So what binds Platonists
297320	303480	together is their belief that philosophy can discover unique knowledge and so this is the
303520	309880	central question to this book and to this whole inquiry is does philosophy have unique
309880	314600	knowledge, can philosophy tell us something about the world? And so we get to this conflict
314600	321240	of Platonism versus naturalism. Gerson agrees with Rorty that Platonism just is systematic
321240	327080	philosophy and this means that we can look at other systematic philosophers like Spinoza,
327160	334160	Hegel or Leibniz and we can actually see them as constructing versions of Platonism.
334680	339640	They have many of the same assumptions, the same kinds of conclusions and when we introduce
339640	344920	this conflict of Platonism versus naturalism we can see that philosophers fall on some
344920	350320	side of this divide and some try and kind of synthesize the two positions although Gerson,
350320	355240	another one of his central arguments is that a synthesis isn't really possible. In the
355240	362520	end you have to make your choice between Platonism or naturalism. So he says Platonism first came
362520	367720	under attack from Christian philosophers who wanted to identify the first principle of all
367720	374840	with the God of Scripture and so the kind of theism that would have come out of early Christianity
374840	381800	would have been in conflict with the idea of divinity that's present in Platonism with the one
382760	390040	but he sees the second wave of attack as more significant. Of course there's a conflict here
390040	397640	but this is kind of remedied or synthesized by people like Thomas Aquinas and Saint Augustine.
398520	403720	Eric Perl in his book Thinking Bean which we covered on my book club this year basically
403720	408760	argues that Thomas Aquinas should be read as a Neoplatonist philosopher and that he really takes
408840	415800	his whole philosophy of divinity and its relation to the world from Platonists and he synthesizes
415800	421560	this with Scripture and with the Christian God but the second wave of attack is more significant.
421560	426920	It comes into 17th century when Platonism which had by then become wedded to Christianity came
426920	433320	under attack from naturalism and the history of philosophy since then has been various failed
433320	440760	attempts in Gerson's opinion to marry naturalism and Platonism. So of course you know the 17th
440760	447240	century we get the the scientific revolution the rejection of the kind of Aristotelian approach to
447240	455000	nature and new philosophies and new defenses of forms of naturalism and then Gerson's reading of
455960	461800	enlightenment philosophers like Hegel or like Leibniz is that they're trying to synthesize
462760	466200	naturalism and Platonism trying to come up with some kind of middle position.
468040	474680	And so the first part of this book Platonism and Naturalism is dealing with the important question
474680	480920	of what actually is Platonism. As mentioned earlier there is a sort of standard introductory reading
480920	487480	to Plato that Gerson feels misses a lot of important points so let's begin. Understanding
487480	493400	Platonism requires historical investigation. Although there are historical divisions among
493400	499800	Platonists the divisions occur under the umbrella of shared principles. Platonism is this school of
499800	507000	thought that has worked out over centuries and there are many influential important Platonists
507000	510840	and we have to look at the sort of dialogue between them and how that unfolds to really
510840	516120	understand Platonism. Platonism insists on the distinctness of its subject matter which is nothing
516120	521800	but the subject matter of philosophy. This subject matter is the intelligible world or what is
521800	528200	available to thought as opposed to sense perception. This is a very important aspect of Platonist
528200	534280	worldview is that philosophy has a distinct subject matter because it's concerned with
534280	538440	the intelligible world and this is something that's separate from mere sense perception.
539080	545400	Plato sought explanatory reductivism. He believed there were ultimate explanations for things that
545400	551400	were as simple as possible. This explanatory reductivism is ultimately satisfied by the
551400	557400	ultimate explanation of a superordinate first principle the idea of the good. Much modern
557400	563000	scholarship on Platonism ignores how central this is to the Platonic system so as mentioned this is
563000	569240	why the work of Gerson is really interesting is because he centers everything around the idea of
569240	574120	the good and how central it is in Plato's system. The idea of the good or the one as it was called
574120	581480	in later Platonism and this is in the dialogues but it's only pointed to in some brief passages
581480	587080	so people really miss the importance of this in the opinion of Gerson. Platonism must also be
587080	593560	understood as a rejection of philosophical precursors and specifically of materialism,
593560	600760	mechanism, nominalism, relativism and skepticism and you see each of these positions represented by
601480	607800	different precursors to Plato in the dialogues who Socrates argues with and these are the five
607800	615000	Antes as Gerson calls them so in constructing this kind of Ur-Platonism in finding out what
615000	619880	Platonism is he does this as a kind of negative inquiry where he says that it's a rejection
619880	624520	of these five Antes and from this rejection you get the positive worldview of Platonism.
625080	630520	The five Antes are firstly nominalism. Plato rejects nominalism which is the view that if
630520	636680	two or more things are the same then they must be identical. Nominalism there's no conceptual
636680	643640	space for sameness that is not identity. Essentially nominalism is the rejection of
643640	650840	universals. It's a rejection that there are things common to things like you know redness
650920	661480	or you know tuness that they're common to them but not identical so again it's essentially the
661480	668600	rejection of universals. Materialism is the view that the only thing that exists are bodies that
668600	675000	is three-dimensional solids and whatever supervene's on or is epiphenomenal to these bodies so this is
675000	681560	obviously the dominant way of thinking about the world today with our sort of scientific view of
681560	689240	things that it's just kind of matter and motion and these three-dimensional solids sort of slam
689240	695720	together and out of that we sort of accidentally get complexity and this is how everything really
696440	703000	is explained in a sort of scientific worldview. The third principle Plato rejects is mechanism
703080	708760	which is the principle of causal closure it's the view that all causal explanations available to us
708760	715560	are found within a naturalistic framework. Everything is determined by naturalist principles
715560	722120	and there's no getting outside of this naturalist causal chain. He also rejects relativism which
722120	729080	is the view that there exists no normativity independent of the interests or beliefs or desires
729080	735160	of one or more human beings so we have no way to adjudicate any kind of moral judgments any kind of
735880	743160	objective hierarchy of values it's all just subjective preference. Finally he rejects skepticism
743160	748920	which is the view that there exists no infallible cognition and it's interesting or it's important
748920	755880	to remember that all five of these aunties basically come about as a part of the naturalist
755880	762360	worldview and in the view of Gerson if you are a naturalist you have to accept all five of these
762360	768120	positions and so Platonism in rejecting and arguing against all of these is showing the
768120	774600	untenability of naturalism. So if you're a naturalist if you believe that all there is
774600	781160	is the objects of this world you would have to be a nominalist there's no space for something
781160	787160	like the number four or the color red existing in some kind of ideal or conceptual space beyond
787160	793560	its instantiation in the world. You'd have to be a materialist because again if you're a naturalist
793560	800120	how can you posit some kind of ideal forms or substances beyond the things we observe in the
800120	806920	world as kind of implied by naturalism. You'd have to accept mechanism because again what kind of
806920	814120	things would play a causal role if not for things observed in the world in a naturalist
814120	822040	worldview you would have to be a relativist because what kind of you know what kind of thing would
822040	828120	an objective moral good or some kind of objective standard be that's not presented to us just by
828120	833320	what we observe by nature that's something that comes about true cognition true value judgments
833400	837640	and making that objective in a naturalist worldview is basically untenable.
838600	844760	And we also see that naturalism often leads to skepticism I guess the best example is the
844760	849400	philosophy of David Hume and you could look at someone like Rorty himself and this kind of
849400	855880	skeptical attitude that if naturalism is true why would we suppose that our minds can access some
855880	863720	kind of infallible cognition you know we are just evolved apes with brains that are evolved for
863720	869400	survival rather than for truth and it would be a very strange thing if we had access to some kind
869400	876680	of ideal space of objective truth. So Plato rejects all of these in his rejection of naturalism.
876680	882760	Now what's also necessary to understand Platonism as well as the rejection of these five principles
883320	890360	is Plato's explanatory reductivism. So throughout the dialogues a positive and systematic position
890360	894520	can be sketched out in opposition to these views this is that was the negative side this is the
894520	901160	kind of positive side of Plato. According to Gerson the central pillar of the positive construct
901160	907640	on the basis of this foundation is clear and unambiguous it is an unhypothetical first principle
907640	913240	of all called in the republic the idea of the good and according to Aristotle's testimony
913240	919240	identified by Plato with the one. If Platonism doesn't have this systematic unity then the
919240	924920	individual elements must fall apart. Each of Plato's arguments against his predecessors relies on the
924920	930520	coherence of the other aspects of his philosophy and each relies on the explanatory role of the
930520	939000	first principle of all. Gerson emphasizes this a lot that when people try to understand say Plato's
939000	946440	view of ethics or his view on the forms or his view on knowledge something like this and they
946440	951160	take this in isolation from the rest of his philosophy and even ignore something like the
951160	956360	first principle of all the idea of the good that it starts to not make sense and it all
956360	961240	becomes very kind of arbitrary so you have to understand this as a complete system there's
961240	966760	an all or nothing binary between Platonism and naturalism either every element of Platonism
966760	972360	holds up as a complete alternative or they all collapse and this is the central argument of
972360	978440	this book it's one or the other it's Platonism or naturalism. Platonism and philosophy are identical
978440	981720	if naturalism is true there is no role for philosophy.
981720	990360	So now since we've constructed this binary between Platonism and naturalism it's worth
990360	997560	looking at what actually is naturalism. So naturalism maintains that there is no realm or subject
997560	1003240	matter that is unreachable by the natural sciences specifically the realm of the immaterial. Now we
1003240	1008760	should be well acquainted with naturalism today because it's really the dominant mode of thought
1008760	1014200	when it comes to questions of philosophy you can think of like something like the New Atheist
1014200	1018440	movement right people like Richard Dawkins are just preaching naturalism and kind of basic
1018440	1023720	arguments for naturalism in the naturalist worldview but there are examples in antiquity of
1023720	1031240	course there's the atomism of Democritus and Lucretius and the Stoics also attempted to synthesize
1031240	1037720	Platonist and naturalist principles for example they accepted mechanism and materialism but they
1037720	1043080	did maintain a kind of teleology in attempt to overcome relativism which we'll look at later.
1043720	1049960	Modern naturalists often admit elements which naturalism cannot explain for example consciousness,
1049960	1055800	intentionality, truths of mathematics but they either claim that these are a mystery or that they
1055800	1060840	will eventually be explained by natural science. This is something that's probably become a lot
1060840	1066760	more common in recent times is the naturalist kind of accepting the limitations of the naturalist
1066760	1072520	worldview but saying look this worldview works it's better than any of the alternatives and
1073240	1078680	we often get this extreme faith and kind of scientific progress where they don't really
1078680	1083960	have a good account of something like consciousness but they put their faith that well eventually
1083960	1088760	science will be able to explain all of these things not recognizing that sometimes there's
1088760	1093640	a kind of qualitative gap to be bridged in explaining these things that can't just be
1093640	1100600	explained by sort of quantitative additions to our knowledge through science. Gerson says quote
1100600	1105640	my working hypothesis is that there is no stable rapprochement between Platonism and naturalism
1105640	1110440	I'm certainly not alone in thinking that this is the case though I suspect that I would have
1110440	1114840	more support in this thought from naturalists and from Platonists. If I am right then the
1114840	1119560	possibility of philosophy understood as a source of knowledge independent of the natural sciences
1119560	1125560	depends on a defense of Platonism. Platonism entails the subordination of the sciences but
1125560	1131160	not their elimination naturalism entails the elimination of Platonism and so the elimination
1131160	1141480	of philosophy. Now of course any discussion of Platonism has to include the forms and this is
1141480	1148360	how we begin our explanation of Platonism which is a Plato posits the forms as explanatory entities.
1148360	1153560	The theory of forms is supposed to explain identity and difference. How can numerically
1153560	1161320	different things be the same? How can we say that two things are both red or both beautiful
1162040	1167320	even though they're different? The relationship between sensible objects and the forms is one
1167320	1174360	of participation for Plato so Helen participates in the form of beauty and so you can have multiple
1174360	1180200	people participating in the form of beauty and so this is how many things can be the same.
1181000	1185800	Because thinking and sense perception are irreducibly different the object of thinking is
1185800	1191640	not a particular object of a particular sense but a form or structure of whatever it is that is
1191640	1197560	also available to the senses. So this is what thought does uniquely is disability to kind of
1197640	1204680	universalize things and forms are neither universal or particular. They're universal in
1204680	1210840	relation to the thinker of the form and particular in relation to a particular object having an
1210840	1215720	instance of the form. So the forms don't really exist this way it's often thought where there's
1215720	1221320	this like world of forms where there's a perfect chair and a perfect circle and the perfect color
1221320	1228840	red. They are both universal and particular so they are instantiated in the world but when we
1228840	1236760	think them we think them universally. The forms allow for what Gerson calls non-exclusive
1236760	1242440	predication allowing us to cognize things which are not uniquely possessed. So this is kind of
1242440	1249080	the same thing said a different way that if Helen is beautiful the statement is true
1249080	1253720	then it is both true that Helen's beauty uniquely belongs to her and her beauty does not uniquely
1253720	1259800	belong to her. The main argument for this is that without it re-identifying sensibles would become
1259800	1265880	impossible and this is the basis for Plato's rejection of Heraclitianism the philosopher
1265880	1272680	Heraclitus. Re-identifying something at another point in time requires a metaphysical identity.
1272680	1279880	If all you have is flux, if all you have is process without any kind of forms that this
1279880	1287080	flux enters into then your worldview would become completely unintelligible. Now Plato also believes
1287080	1293320	that this is necessary to explain false predicate of judgments. So saying something like Socrates
1293320	1298680	is sitting requires one to understand what it means to say he is standing. False predicate of
1298680	1304120	judgments are only intelligible owing to the intelligibility of true predicate of judgments.
1304920	1311720	So now we get to the idea of the good which as mentioned Gerson sees as absolutely central to
1311720	1317880	the whole Platonist system. The whole system is really built and downstream of the idea of the good
1318440	1323720	and this is something that is left out of many accounts of Platonism. So what ties all the
1323720	1329560	elements of Platonism together is a metaphysical first principle of all the idea of the good.
1329560	1335640	The good is beyond essence or wattness and can only be inferred from its effects. Anything that has
1335640	1342280	been is an effect of the good. All philosophical explanation converges on the good. We know from
1342280	1347880	Aristotle's testimony another fragments that Plato identified the good with the one. The good
1347880	1353400	is the one because it must be beyond any principles of limit and therefore unqualifiably simple.
1353960	1358440	And the forms are good like because they are principles of integrative unity.
1358440	1363240	However the forms are not ultimate explanations because none of them are qualifiably one.
1363960	1369320	The ultimate first principle of the one or the good is what makes Plato's philosophy hierarchical.
1370040	1374440	The greater unity there is the closer something is to the first principle.
1374440	1378840	Identifying the one with the good means unity is also an index of goodness.
1379080	1386120	Now why does Plato even posit the idea of the good? Well we don't find anywhere in the dialogues or
1386120	1392600	in the indirect tradition of Platonism an actual argument for depositing of this superordinate
1392600	1399800	first principle of all that's beyond existence and essence. But Gerson argues that we can discern
1399800	1404840	Plato's reasons for doing this based on the assumptions of his philosophy and these are that
1404840	1410680	first he assumed that there were explanations for things and secondly he was an explanatory
1410680	1415800	reductivist which is a term used earlier which is just to say that he sought first principles
1415800	1421720	that were foundational and simple. The sought for principle must be different to that which it explains
1422440	1426920	and lastly if the first principle of all is the source of everything it must also be the
1426920	1432360	explanation for the end or goal of everything. Quote if the good is the source of essence it
1432360	1439480	is also the fulfillment of essence. This idea is very central to Platonism that the greater
1439480	1446280	generates the lesser and then the greater is both the source and the end of the lesser and so the
1446280	1451480	end of everything is the good or the one and then of course this gets us this way of measuring
1451480	1458760	hierarchy where hierarchy is to move towards unity or integrative unity and the ultimate unity
1458760	1464280	is the one and so the one generates or emanates the world and then the world is kind of directed
1464280	1470280	back towards unity and goodness in this way. So this is central to the Platonic system and this
1470280	1475880	is where we move to virtue and its relation to the idea of the good because as mentioned earlier
1475880	1481640	accounts of Plato's ethics and other aspects of his philosophy when they're divorced from the
1481640	1486520	idea of the good there ends up being all sorts of contradictions and it becomes very arbitrary so
1486520	1492120	we have to re-examine Platonic virtue in light of the centrality of the idea of the good.
1492760	1500360	Aristotle critiques the form of the good in Nicomachean ethics. His main argument is that the
1500360	1507000	good is not univocally predicable like other forms which is just to say that good in the context of
1507000	1512520	when means another thing to good in the context of how there are different forms of goodness.
1513480	1518840	There are a number of places in the dialogues in which Plato seems to group and differently a form
1518840	1524280	of the good along with other forms and yet in the Republic the idea of the good is said to be
1524280	1530840	beyond essence. So Proclus later Platonus his explanation for this is that Plato posits both
1530840	1536680	a form of the good among other forms and also this superordinate idea of the good or the one.
1537400	1542040	Plato argues that the idea of the good is the source of the goodness of every particular good
1542600	1547320	this would mean that there's no conflict between what is good for an individual and what is the
1547320	1553400	good just as it would be incoherent to ask if a mathematical truth which is true for me is also
1553400	1560600	true. If that which appears to be good for oneself is really good it is because it indirectly manifests
1560600	1566440	or instantiates the idea of the good the principle of measure and the source of truth and beauty.
1567240	1574200	So this gives us kind of a better understanding of this idea from Socrates that no one owes willingly
1574840	1581080	that evil is just caused by ignorance and if we knew the good we would all pursue it because
1581080	1585720	in this Platonus scheme the good and the good for the individual are identical.
1587160	1592760	Now this is interesting goodness as integrative unity this is really central to understanding
1593480	1599880	ethics from a Platonus perspective but again something that's not discussed so much when
1599880	1606280	this topic is typically covered. So because the good is the one the good manifests an integrative
1606280	1613720	unity. Now that's a term you won't see much it's one that Gerson uses what it basically means is
1613720	1619080	the imposition of unity by a higher function on a lower without the elimination of the ladder.
1619720	1626200	Something is good insofar as it is an integrative unity and the one is the cause of the being of
1626200	1633560	the integrative unity of everything. Integrative unity is what makes anything at all intelligible
1633560	1639560	to understand anything it is necessary to see the unity of its parts. The ideal integrative
1639560	1644840	unity of the soul consists in cognitive identity with all that is intelligible. The integrative
1644920	1649720	unity of the soul is that of the parts of the soul ordered according to the rule of reason.
1650360	1657320	This is how integrative unity works the higher integrates and transcends the lower. One of the
1657320	1662920	things it means to say that the good is the one is that the good for a person is achievable only
1662920	1668760	via an integrative unity the sort of unity appropriate for a human being. Built on this
1668760	1673480	metaphysical foundation ethical prescriptions can be judged according to whether or not they
1673480	1679880	inhibit or promote integrative unity. Everyone has his or her own way of unifying their lives
1679880	1685560	or constructing an integrative self-narrative. One life can be judged better than another because
1685560	1690120	it's closer to the good itself. The absolutely simple first principle of all.
1692280	1698600	Music, physical training, mathematics, astronomy and dialectic are concrete ways of achieving the
1698600	1703560	good that is producing an ever greater integrative unity in the human being.
1705080	1710920	Now Eros and the good. The connection between the good as principle and the good as end is made
1710920	1718680	explicit by Plotinus in the Enneads. He says and it the good is itself an object of love and love
1718680	1724920	that is love of itself in as much as it is only beautiful by reason of itself and in itself
1725560	1730440	and indeed whatever is present to itself would not be so if that which is present
1730440	1733560	and that to which it is present were not one or identical.
1735400	1741640	So the good is identified with Eros and the good is beautiful because it is Eros. Of course the
1741640	1746920	Greeks use this term Eros to mean certain kind of passionate, desirous love.
1749160	1754280	Plato says that all things strive for the good and Eros for possession of the beautiful is the
1754280	1759880	same thing as for possession of the good. Everything desires that from which it comes.
1759880	1766200	All beings desire the good and so strive for integrative unity. Plotinus says the good is
1766200	1772920	also Eros of itself that is the good is essentially an activity of self-loving but the good as Plato
1772920	1781800	says is overflowing therefore this self-loving is essentially productive. So this is the Plotinus
1781800	1790600	idea of creation as an emanation of the good of the absolute directed as it were back towards
1790600	1798840	itself by the activity of love and what that looks like concretely being directed back towards
1798840	1805080	source back towards our ultimate end or good is unity integrative unity.
1805400	1811880	Now after having looked at the system of Platonism and how it presents an alternative to
1811880	1817800	naturalism, Gerson turns to historical Platonism and looking at how Platonism unfolded through
1817800	1824600	other Platonists that came after Plato himself and of course where else to start but with Aristotle.
1825800	1830680	Gerson does have a separate book called Aristotle and Other Platonists so this is something he's
1831640	1838040	argued a lot is the proper way to understand Aristotle as a Platonist. Plato's work was
1838040	1846120	still ongoing at the time of his death and Platonism as a systematic philosophy was completed by
1846120	1855160	Aristotle, Plotinus and Proclus. Aristotle shares Plato's five anti's that's the five positions
1855240	1861080	Plato opposed earlier on that we talked about Aristotle also poses all of those and he also
1861080	1866520	shares Plato's positing a metaphysical first principle of all. Scholars often point Aristotle's
1866520	1873000	rejection of the immortality of the soul as a reason for excluding him from Platonism. Gerson
1873000	1878120	argues that none of the fundamentals of Platonism actually require a belief about the immortality
1878120	1883640	of the soul. Also Aristotle believes in the immortality of the intellect which may not be
1883640	1890200	different from the immortal part of the soul that Plato identifies. Aristotle believes that
1890200	1896120	super sensible or immaterial being exists necessarily in which case the denial of its
1896120	1902680	existence entails a contradiction. If immaterial entities did not exist physics would not fill
1902680	1909080	the role of metaphysics as naturalists claim rather there could be no such thing as metaphysics
1909080	1915480	or a science of being qua being. There could only be a science which quote cuts off a part of
1915480	1921480	being and studies that but does not examine being universally. So Aristotle clearly has the same
1921480	1927000	conception of philosophy and what philosophy does in terms of studying intelligible being that
1927000	1932680	science can't study and he clearly has the same perspective on the unique knowledge offered by
1932680	1941000	philosophy. When we look at Aristotle's discussion on first philosophy, Aristotle implies that physics
1941000	1947480	is second philosophy while Plato reserves the term philosophy for what Aristotle calls first
1947480	1954360	philosophy, refusing to designate what naturalists do as philosophy at all. Both of them deny the
1954360	1960200	autonomy of physics. Aristotle unlike Plato thinks that there is only knowledge of what is universal
1960280	1966600	and necessary. What Plato calls philosophy, Aristotle calls first philosophy and both identify
1966600	1972200	its subject matter with the intelligible, nonsensible world. Here is a quote from Gerson on the topic.
1972840	1976760	Since the sign of being qua being is the science of the properties of being
1977640	1981560	and these can only be understood when they are understood as derived from the primary
1981560	1987560	referent of being namely the unmoved mover. All metaphysics is saturated with the immaterial.
1987560	1993160	It is the explanation for the necessity and universality of science and the dependence
1993160	1998200	of physics on the primary referent of being that makes it practically impossible to recruit
1998200	2004920	Aristotle to the ranks of naturalists. Aristotle also contributes the idea of potency to the
2004920	2010440	Platonic project holding that it is not possible to understand any process in nature without
2010440	2017160	understanding the potency which is its terminus. But potency is not sensible and can have no
2017160	2023800	role to play in a naturalist account of nature. So we see a lot of reasons why this approach
2023800	2030120	that is sometimes taken of presenting Aristotle as a philosopher that is friendly to naturalism
2030120	2035000	runs into a lot of problems. And this idea of potency was taken up by later Platonists.
2035800	2042360	Plotinus draws on it quite heavily. Now another thing that Aristotle argues for
2043320	2047560	that is very Platonist but he actually argues for this more explicitly than Plato is the
2047560	2053400	immateriality of the intellect. So Aristotle more than Plato makes arguments for why the
2053400	2060840	intellect must be immaterial. Since we can think of form universally, if intellect was not immaterial
2060840	2065080	then our thinking of form would just be another particularized version of it.
2065960	2071560	Aristotle argues that thinking universally for example of mathematics defies naturalist
2071560	2077320	reduction. Particularized forms are sufficient to serve as guides for survival for plants and
2077320	2085960	animals. So you know the argument is if the naturalist perspective was true why can we think of
2085960	2093000	something like abstract truths of mathematics. This argument is certainly still relevant today
2093000	2100200	when we have accepted Darwinian evolution as the means by which our minds evolved because
2100200	2105480	again the same kind of argument could be made that if that is the case why would our minds,
2105480	2112120	why would our brains be attuned to anything but survival value? Why would we be able to cognize
2112120	2119000	truth or cognize form universally? The universality of thinking requires self-reflexivity.
2119560	2124520	If this were not the case then thinking would just be one part of the brain monitoring another
2124520	2129160	but this would only be a new brain state and universality would not be achieved.
2129160	2134360	Presence of form and the awareness of the presence must be in the same subject and this
2134360	2140200	can only happen if the subject is immaterial and capable of bending back upon itself. Something
2140200	2145960	that material entities with parts cannot do. This is basically an argument that you know the mind
2145960	2151800	must be something other than the brain. When we think, when we cognize, it's not just individual
2151800	2159400	parts of the brain experiencing other parts of the brain but there is a self-reflexivity there
2159400	2165000	in the words of Gersen. Now of course another concept that Aristotle is very closely associated
2165000	2172120	with is his idea of the on-move mover which was quite influential on the development of
2172120	2178840	theism and theistic philosophy. Aristotle agrees with Plato on the subject matter of
2178840	2183720	first philosophy as mentioned which is the intelligible world and that a plurality of
2183720	2189320	principles should be reduced to a unity. Aristotle has the same kind of explanatory
2189320	2194360	reductivism as Plato but their disagreement comes in identifying the nature of the first
2194360	2200280	principle. Aristotle explicitly rejects as the first principle the superordinate idea of the good
2200360	2205720	along with the rest of the forms, the demiurge, and also to claim that the one and the unlimited
2205720	2211080	are the principles out of which the forms are made. However the on-move mover can arguably be
2211080	2216120	held to fulfill the functions of the above. Aristotle agrees with Plato that the first
2216120	2222200	principle is both the source and goal of creation. From the perspective of later plateness the problem
2222200	2228200	with Aristotle's version of that system sprang from his identification of the first principle
2228200	2233320	of all with intellect but they saw Aristotle as someone whose insights could be mine to support
2233320	2240360	a systematic platonic framework. So Aristotle does posit the on-move mover as an eternal intellect
2241160	2246440	and this is certainly different from Plato's conception of the superordinate idea of the good,
2246440	2252920	the one, and later plateness are obviously much closer to Plato on this but we can see that he
2252920	2260280	posits this eternal on-move mover, this eternal intellect to really solve the same kinds of
2260280	2267080	problems that Plato was trying to solve. It's the same kind of explanatory system. So you can see
2267080	2273480	what Rorty meant earlier when he said that even people that disagreed with Plato did so on kind
2273480	2282280	of plateness grounds. Now of course we have to look at Plotinus who probably more than anyone put
2282280	2290120	together a Platonism as a complete coherent system. Plotinus regarded himself and his philosophy as
2290120	2295640	introducing no novelty into Platonism. Instead of discarding Aristotle he integrates many of his
2295640	2302360	insights into a platonic system. The three basic principles of Plotinus philosophy are the triad
2302360	2309720	of one the intellect and the soul which he claims are present in Plato's dialogues. Gerson sees
2309720	2315400	Plotinus drawing out the implications of a necessary first being as his greatest contribution to the
2315400	2321640	Platonic project. Plotinus claims that the first principle must be above being and not as Aristotle
2321640	2329080	claims identical with it. Plotinus argues that being is not unqualifiably one but is a one many.
2329080	2333960	Being cannot be absolutely simple because being means being an existent of some sort.
2334680	2340760	Instead the oneness of being is just the unity of multiplicity. This only makes sense because
2340760	2345080	there is a first principle which transcends being and is unqualifiably one.
2348040	2353400	One thing that Gerson focuses on is Plotinus argument against the Stoics because he thinks
2353400	2359080	this is very relevant to his broader discussion of Platonism and naturalism and his belief that they
2359640	2365160	are incompatible. So Plotinus criticism of the Stoics presents an interest and insight into the
2365160	2370360	opposition between Platonism and naturalism because the Stoics are one of the best examples of trying
2370360	2376440	to deny their incompatibility. Stoics were naturalists that had some elements of Platonism.
2376440	2381400	They believed in materialism, mechanism and nominalism but like the Platonists rejected
2381400	2387560	skepticism and relativism. Plotinus agrees with the Stoics that the rational life is the best life
2387640	2393400	but Stoics cannot explain why rationally participating in the cosmos is superior to
2393400	2398840	participating in the way non-rational creatures do. Plotinus believes a satisfactory answer
2398840	2405080	requires the idea of the good to great achievements. If Stoics accepted this and added relativism to
2405080	2410760	their worldview then reason would just be an instrumental servant of the passions. Stoics
2410760	2417880	can't maintain both materialism and universal normativity. So really although Plotinus is
2417880	2423640	sympathetic to the Stoics because they have this kind of platonic insight of privileging
2423640	2431160	reason and the life of reason and a more kind of ascetic approach to things it's really hard
2431160	2440440	to base this in a materialist worldview. Again why you know if nature is what's to be worshipped,
2440440	2446440	celebrated and if you have this mechanistic materialist worldview why would reason be
2446440	2452680	superior to any other form of life? So although the Stoic approach to things is coming from
2453640	2459480	positive intuition and many of the prescriptions they would make on the ethical life are very
2459480	2465240	similar to Platonism they can't ultimately ground this without some absolute, without something
2466120	2473480	that is superordinate in order to grade ways of living and to explain why reason and the
2473480	2480680	rational life is superior to irrational life. Why would the sage be in any way superior in
2480680	2486520	the way he lives to non-human life that behaves irrationally? So the Stoics don't really have
2486600	2492280	a good explanation here. Now another very influential later Platonist is Proclus.
2493080	2500200	Proclus is probably best known as most important contribution to Platonism is he kind of comes
2500200	2506520	up with a full theology of Platonism that he feels could be married to Greek polytheism.
2507240	2512840	Now Proclus is dealing with the problem left by Plotinus which is how does this
2513640	2521800	absolutely beyond being version of the one and how does this generate multiplicity? How
2521800	2527160	does this generate the world without really being directly related to it without being itself
2527800	2533560	determined in any way? The central problem left by Plotinus was how multiplicity could
2533560	2539720	proceed from the one while it remains without multiplicity. The answer of Proclus is to posit
2539800	2548600	intermediary henads or unities and these really are the gods. So Proclus argues that these energies,
2548600	2557000	these henads are greater unities than the forms and so they can explain how the one can generate
2557000	2562600	multiplicity much better than the system of Plotinus. As participated unities the henads bridge the
2562600	2568120	gap between the one and multiplicity. They're more unified than each form but less unified than the
2568120	2573960	one and as mentioned this allows Proclus to unify Platonist metaphysics and the traditional gods
2573960	2580600	of Greek religion. Now it's still not really clear if this solves the problem Proclus was
2580600	2586520	dealing with. There's still the issue of how the one generates multiplicity even if there are these
2586520	2592040	greater unities in between. It seems you could get some kind of infinite regress where there'd be
2593000	2597320	more unified things all the way up. There'd be something more unified than the henads between
2597320	2604440	the henads and the one and dealing with these really fundamental questions about the one and its
2604440	2612600	relation to existence is what came to occupy later Platonists and specifically Damascus who
2612600	2618840	was the last head of Plato's Academy. He raises problems with the very intelligibility of the
2618840	2626040	idea of the one. The first principle of all must be absolutely simple but if it is absolutely simple
2626040	2632440	it is impossible for it to be causally connected to anything. Damascus makes these arguments in his
2632440	2638280	work Problems and Solutions Concerning First Principles where he really draws out all of the
2638280	2644200	implications and kind of dialectical contradictions that happen whenever we try and intellectually
2644200	2650840	conceive of the absolute and its relation to ourselves. Another argument he makes is that if
2650840	2656200	the first principle of all is disconnected from all things then the universe would not be the
2656200	2662200	totality of all things but if the first principle is part of the totality of things it is not a
2662200	2669000	first principle. But also we can't say that the totality of things is its own explanation
2669000	2674600	because unless there is a distinction between what is explicable and what is not then there's no such
2674600	2681320	thing as an explanation at all. Here Gerson says we're left with a profound apuria. There must
2681320	2686440	be an ultimate explanation for everything but such an explanation can neither be disconnected from
2686440	2691800	everything nor a part of everything and Damascus takes away even the possibility of negative
2691800	2697720	predications to the one. All discourse or intellectual grasping concerning the one is
2697720	2704200	subject to dialectical contradiction. Damascus thus emphasizes the importance of not attempting to
2704200	2711240	grasp the ineffable by means of any language so although Damascus does certainly believe in the
2711240	2717240	necessity of positing the one of positeness absolute first principle of ultimate reality
2718040	2727000	he really resembles a lot of buddhist and later mystical thinkers in emphasizing that reason
2727000	2733640	thought and language is just really limited in what we can say negatively or positively about
2733640	2740920	the nature of this and so he actually advises a kind of learned ignorance again a kind of mystical
2740920	2746680	sentiment that he advises his followers not to try too hard to intellectually grasp this but to
2746680	2753080	kind of live in the mystery and to understand a true intuition and through a kind of live knowing
2753080	2760040	that he believes is accessible to everyone. Again Platonism is bound up with a kind of mysticism
2760040	2767000	and with an experiential aspect to its philosophy and this seems to be really emphasized in Damascus
2768360	2774520	but as demonstrated by Damascus, Platonist successors came to appreciate perhaps a resolvable
2774520	2780440	tension between the absolute simplicity of the one and its explanatory adequacy for the many
2781320	2786840	and Gerson concludes that quote the alternative to naturalism of any sort and along with that
2786840	2792520	the possibility of philosophy depends on the resolution of this tension. So Gerson rejects
2792520	2800120	naturalism he presents Platonism as really the only alternative to rejecting the tenets of naturalism
2800920	2807560	and at the close of the book he does say that these difficulties presented by Damascus and this
2807560	2814040	sort of fundamental difficulty in Platonism is the one potential crack in the system or it's the
2814040	2820360	one thing that needs to be resolved that needs to be dealt with is how this absolutely simple
2820360	2826200	first principle relates to creation relates to the multiplicity and Gerson kind of leaves that as
2826200	2831640	an open question at the end of this book but that is Platonism and naturalism by Gerson.
2832920	2838600	I hope this was helpful as an introduction to Platonism as mentioned a lot of the introductions
2838680	2845160	and discussions around Platonism don't really deal with this deeper sort of Platonic framework
2845720	2851240	that emerged and that was common to Platonists it doesn't deal with things like the centrality of
2851240	2857160	the idea of the good the one to Platonism and so I thought this book and a presentation on it is
2857160	2862520	a good way to put the whole of Platonism as a system into perspective and also to present this
2862520	2868120	conflict that I do believe exists between Platonism and naturalism and it's an interesting angle it's
2868120	2874680	an interesting way to read for the history of Western philosophy as basically a conflict between
2875480	2880760	Platonism and naturalism and then you can read philosophers since the Enlightenment you can
2880760	2888760	read them as trying to synthesize it in some way so for example you just take the example of the
2888760	2895400	five anti's that were outlined so someone like Schopenhauer would reject materialism he rejects
2895480	2903080	skepticism as well but he does maintain mechanism or determinism so you can see you can read various
2903080	2909960	philosophers in this way and see their systems as attempt to marry Platonism and naturalism by
2911160	2917400	bringing together some of these anti's a rejection of them with an affirmation of others
2918040	2923960	and I think this is actually quite insightful I think this is quite an interesting way of
2924040	2931880	viewing philosophy because as Rorty says without this sort of fundamental union between thought
2931880	2939800	and being and the potential of our intellect to commune with being and with the intelligible
2939800	2945400	world in a very fundamental way that we can trust then the whole possibility of philosophy
2946600	2951080	becomes difficult to maintain and it seems like one would have to commit themselves to
2951880	2958200	skepticism and to a naturalist materialist view of the world so going back to these
2958200	2963000	arguments and looking at how they unfolded and really boiling it down to the fundamental
2963000	2968920	conflicts that exist here I think is is quite helpful but that's all for now I hope you enjoyed
