1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
They called themselves neoregonites, but were willing to answer to neoconservatives or hawks.

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,480
Paul Wolfowitz was generally considered the brains of the outfit.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,480
Paul Wolfowitz believed then that it was a mistake to end the war as we did under the

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,240
circumstances that we did.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,480
They underestimated the way in which Saddam was able to cling to power and the means he

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,440
would use to remain in power.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,800
That was the mistake.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,640
One of the most controversial assertions made in the Israel lobby and foreign policy by

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,880
John Mersheimer and Stephen Walt is that members of the lobby played a principal and necessary

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,680
role in the plan to invade Iraq in 2003.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,080
For them, they argue, the invasion would not have happened.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,800
As Stephen Walt wrote years after the book was published in Foreign Affairs, even some

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,120
readers who were generally sympathetic to our overall position found that claim hard

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,320
to accept, and some left-wing critics accused us of letting Bush and Cheney off the hook

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,360
or of ignoring the importance of other interests, especially oil.

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,960
Rather than oil, the pair contend, it was a powerful group within the Israel lobby,

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,520
the driving force of America's hawkish interventionism and proponents of spreading democracy by the

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,360
barrel of the gun.

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,400
Or here's a less graceful description from prominent neo-conservative Michael Ladine

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,600
of the American Enterprise Institute.

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,440
Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up a small, crappy little country

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,720
and throw it against the wall, just to show we mean business.

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,120
Ladine was at one time a consultant to the U.S. National Security Council.

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,720
Norman Finkelstein, a key critic of Israel today, as they carry out a genocide in the

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,960
Gaza Strip, was at the time of the book's publishing openly at odds with Mersheimer

26
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,200
and Walt over this very issue.

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,320
The argument that Steve Walt and I make in our book is that the Israel lobby, again,

28
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,200
mainly the neo-conservatives, were the principal driving force in the United States behind

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
the war in Iraq.

30
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,840
Now, we argue that the lobby by itself, or the neo-conservatives by themselves, couldn't

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,440
make the war happen.

32
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,760
They definitely needed President Bush and Vice President Cheney to be on board.

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,480
And that happened after September 11th.

34
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,760
I do not think the evidence supports that claim.

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,560
The chief architects of the war were Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Cheney.

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,120
And I doubt anyone would claim that Mr. Cheney or Mr. Rumsfeld have any allegiances other

37
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,680
than to the U.S. government.

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,840
Not satisfied with merely debating, Mersheimer, Finkelstein devoted a chapter in his knowing

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,280
too much to the Iraq question, where he gives a brief but helpful history of the neo-conservatives

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,720
The founding fathers of neo-conservatism, such as Irving Kristol,

41
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,360
He has been called the godfather of neo-conservatives,

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,360
wrote the Marxist wave in the 1930s.

43
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:33,160
Irving Kristol, Norman Potthoritz, Midge Dector, the magazines around which they coalesced,

44
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,680
were basically partisan review and commentary.

45
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,360
When this wave crested after World War II, they joined in the liberal anti-communist witch-hunt

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
of the 1950s.

47
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,400
The neo-conservatives then rode the new left wave in the early 1960s.

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,000
When it crested in the mid-1960s, they again joined in the establishment backlash to it.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,560
As the spectrum of respectable opinion in the U.S. shifted steadily rightward, the Jewish

50
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,200
neo-conservatives galloped yet more swiftly, eventually crossing the Rubicon from the Democratic

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,240
Party to the Republican Party.

52
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,880
As Finkelstein writes, the collapse of the Soviet Union shifted the focus of the neo-conservatives,

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,240
and indeed U.S. defense policy makers generally, on the Middle East.

54
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,960
However, he staunchly disagreed on a key argument put forth in the Israel lobby.

55
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,000
The most sensational item on Mersheimer and Waltz' charge sheet alleges that the disastrous

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,640
decision of the Bush administration to invade Iraq in 2003 was orchestrated by the Israel

57
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,840
lobby.

58
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,080
Finkelstein argues that if the principal architects of the war, namely George Bush, Dick Cheney,

59
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,080
and Donald Rumsfeld, were motivated by Israel, why in the first and second-hand accounts

60
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,360
of the pre-war behind-the-scenes debates of the Bush administration, Israel barely gets

61
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,680
a passing mention.

62
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,400
Finkelstein looks to their memoirs.

63
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,600
In her memoir No Higher Honor, Condoleezza Rice, who was national security advisor in

64
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,520
the Bush administration, does not list or even allude to Israeli security as the or

65
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,080
even a motive behind the attack.

66
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,240
In his memoir Known and Unknown, Donald Rumsfeld, who was secretary of defense in the Bush

67
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,240
administration, also does not list or even allude to Israeli security as the or even

68
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,080
a motive behind the attack.

69
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,760
In his memoir In My Time, Dick Cheney, who was vice president in the Bush administration,

70
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,360
also does not list or even allude to Israeli security as the or even a motive behind the

71
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,800
attack.

72
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,760
If the Israel lobby played such a critical role in the decision to attack Iraq, how

73
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,600
was it able to so effectively cover its tracks?

74
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,600
One could understand why Cheney et al might want to conceal that oil was the impetus behind

75
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,040
the attack, but it is unclear what motive they would have to conceal the Israel lobby's

76
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
role.

77
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,560
It's a good question.

78
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,240
If Israel played an important role in the decision to invade Iraq, one would think that

79
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,000
this would be mentioned in the various memoirs of the perpetrators.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,760
In Mersheimer and Waltz book, they quote, knowledgeable and well-respected individuals

81
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,760
who had said openly that the war was linked with Israel's security.

82
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,280
Beginning with a Philip Zellico In September of 2002, Zellico was a member

83
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,560
of the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, known to insiders as PIFIAB.

84
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,080
He would also serve as executive director of the 9-11 Commission and as counselor to

85
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,200
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

86
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,680
They've also written at least two books together.

87
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,400
His words before an audience at the University of Virginia on September 10, 2002, were first

88
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,120
reported by Imad McKay of the Interpress Service in 2004.

89
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,680
While speaking on a panel of foreign policy experts, Zellico said the following statements.

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
The unstated threat.

91
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,520
And here I criticized the Bush administration a little because the argument that they make

92
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,840
over and over again is that this is about a threat to the United States.

93
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,200
And then everybody says, show me an imminent threat from Iraq to America.

94
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:30,160
Show me, why would Iraq attack America or use nuclear weapons against us?

95
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,080
So I'll tell you what I think the real threat is.

96
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,360
It actually has been since 1990.

97
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,680
It's the threat against Israel.

98
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,360
And this is the threat that dare not speak its name because the Europeans don't care

99
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,160
deeply about that threat, I will tell you frankly.

100
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,320
And the American government doesn't want to lean too hard on it rhetorically because

101
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,480
it's not a popular cell.

102
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,280
Zellico names a familiar foe.

103
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,280
If the danger is a biological weapon handed to Hamas, then what's the American alternative

104
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,480
then?

105
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Play out those scenarios.

106
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,200
Don't look at the ties between Iraq and al-Qaeda.

107
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,840
But then ask yourself the question, G is Iraq tied to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic

108
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,800
jihad and the people who carry out suicide bombings in Israel?

109
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,520
Easy question to answer and the evidence is abundant.

110
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,080
Zellico was right.

111
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,320
In an October 2002 Human Rights Watch report on Palestinian suicide bombings during the

112
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,840
Second Antifada, they note that Saddam Hussein's government provides funds to families of martyrs

113
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,320
and others and has established a differential in which families of suicide bombing operatives

114
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,080
are said to receive a considerably larger sum of $25,000 while other families that have

115
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,800
suffered a death receive $10,000.

116
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,600
Iraq provides these monies through the local Bath Party-affiliated Arab Liberation Front

117
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,960
or ALF.

118
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,560
The ALF is a constituent member of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

119
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,800
They cite an informative article from the Sydney Morning Herald.

120
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,320
Its author, Paul McHugh, interviewed the Arab Liberation Front's Secretary General,

121
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,920
Raqqat Saleh, who confirmed that since late 2000, more than 800 families have received

122
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,640
martyr payments of $10,000.

123
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,360
It's transferred by the banks, he said, from the Iraqi banks to the banks in Palestine.

124
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,200
Philip Zellico was not happy with Mersheimer and Walt publishing his quote in the original

125
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,480
article which later became the book.

126
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,200
In the end notes of the subsequent book, Mersheimer and Walt write,

127
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,600
We used these quotations in our original article in the London Review of Books and Zellico

128
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,360
challenged our interpretation of them.

129
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,360
We based our discussion on a full and unimpeachable record of his remarks and his challenge has

130
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,280
no basis in fact.

131
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:58,840
Ironically, Zellico appears to have been proving the point made in his original speech.

132
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,600
As we saw earlier, Finkelstein's skepticism of Mersheimer-Walt's argument includes the

133
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,240
fact that there is no mention of Israel as a motivation for invading Iraq in the memoirs

134
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,960
of Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and others.

135
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,720
But should that not itself elicit pause and skepticism?

136
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,840
In his decision points, George W. Bush recalls a meeting with British Premier Tony Blair

137
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,480
in April of 2002.

138
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,320
In April 2002, Tony and Sherry visited Lor and me in Crawford.

139
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,200
Tony and I talked about coercive diplomacy as a way to address the threat from Iraq.

140
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,880
Tony suggested that we seek a UN Security Council resolution that presented Saddam with

141
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,720
a clear ultimatum.

142
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,040
Allow weapons inspectors back into Iraq or face serious consequences.

143
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,760
As I recall that discussion, it was less to do with specifics about what we were going

144
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,800
to do on Iraq or indeed the Middle East because the Israel issue was a big, big issue at

145
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
the time.

146
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,240
In fact, I think I remember actually there may have been conversations that we had even

147
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,520
with Israelis, the two of us, whilst we were there.

148
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,000
So that was a major part of all this.

149
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,400
But the principal part of my conversation, we've got to deal with the various different

150
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,560
dimensions of this whole issue.

151
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,720
As we can clearly see, Blair provides details peculiarly absent from Bush's telling.

152
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,160
Bush also railed against his critics in his memoir, saying some alleged that America's

153
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,960
real intent was to control Iraq's oil or satisfy Israel.

154
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,480
Those theories were false.

155
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,880
I was sending our troops into combat to protect the American people.

156
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Saddam refused to cooperate with weapons inspectors, even with the threat of an invasion on his

157
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,240
doorstep.

158
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,720
The only logical conclusion was that he was hiding WMD.

159
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,760
Despite an October 2003 Congressional Research Service report, which noted that from late

160
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:03,680
November 2002 to March 2003, UN inspectors combed Iraq looking for weapons of mass destruction,

161
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,960
conducting over 750 inspections at 550 sites.

162
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,000
There's also the findings of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's report on Iraq

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,320
WMD published in 2004.

164
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,000
One of the committee's members, the late Dianne Feinstein, stated in no uncertain terms

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,560
the state of Iraq's so-called nuclear program in the lead up to the invasion.

166
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,120
I think it is clear that there was not an ongoing nuclear program.

167
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,960
In August of 2002, prior to the vote in the Senate on the authorization to go to war,

168
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,840
I spent a day in Vienna at the International Atomic Energy Agency.

169
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,600
The IAEA is the agency that runs nuclear inspections.

170
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,520
They saw no signs of a nuclear program in Iraq.

171
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,600
The IAEA convinced me that there was no ongoing nuclear program in Iraq.

172
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,640
The intelligence reporting on a possible Iraqi nuclear program did not have an impact on

173
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,000
me because I did not believe it was correct.

174
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,280
Though she still voted for the war oddly enough.

175
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,480
The reason for the Bush administration's quietness about the role of Israel in the planning

176
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,800
is evidenced by a revealing article in the Jewish Forward newspaper.

177
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,080
The article is absent from both its English language and Yiddish language archives.

178
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,680
It took some serious digging to find, actually, oddly enough, though Internet archive finally

179
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,600
came through with the right maneuvering.

180
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,360
It's called Iraqi Move Puts Israel in Lonely U.S. Corner.

181
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,360
And it was written by Mark Perlman for the week of September 20, 2002 edition.

182
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,560
In contrast to Bush's memoir alleging Saddam refused to cooperate with weapons inspectors

183
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,440
with the only logical conclusion being Saddam possessed WMD, Saddam Hussein's surprise

184
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,320
acceptance of unconditional United Nations weapons inspections put Israel in the hot seat

185
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,560
this week, forcing it into the open as the only nation actively supporting the Bush administration's

186
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,520
goal of Iraqi regime change.

187
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,680
Israel's diffident stance appeared untenable this week after most capitals welcomed the

188
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,760
Iraqi announcement Monday that it would accept the return of weapons inspectors without conditions.

189
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,280
Further, Perlman writes, Israel and its supporters have insisted for weeks that while they sympathize

190
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,440
with the administration's hardline stance toward Baghdad, they were reluctant to advocate

191
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
any position openly.

192
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,640
The reluctance was fueled by fears that critics would claim the United States was going to

193
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:43,160
war on Israel's behalf, or even, as some have suggested, at Israel's behest.

194
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,840
These concerns came a month after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told the Knesset Foreign Affairs

195
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,960
and Defense Committee that Iraq is the greatest danger facing Israel.

196
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,880
Though he clarified, we aren't intervening in U.S. decisions, but he said that strategic

197
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:04,360
coordination between Israel and the U.S. has reached unprecedented dimensions.

198
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,760
Days later, Aluf Ben reported for Haaretz, Israel is pressing the United States not to

199
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,280
defer action aimed at toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.

200
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:20,040
Quoting Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, the problem today is not if, but when.

201
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,280
Adding that while attacking now would be quite dangerous, postponing it would be more dangerous.

202
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,320
Aluf Ben continues, but like Sharon, Peres also added a disclaimer, saying he did not

203
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,880
want to be seen as urging the United States to act and that America should act according

204
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,600
to its own judgment.

205
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:46,680
Israel, he said, will be a good soldier in the camp led by President George W. Bush.

206
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,480
The appetite for war among Israeli officials was on open display.

207
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,720
Foreign Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Benjamin Netanyahu wrote op-eds urging invasion.

208
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,040
Barak wrote for The New York Times, an article titled Taking Apart Iraq's Nuclear Threat.

209
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,320
Those who prefer to wait and hope for the best should contemplate the following.

210
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,080
No one really knows how close Saddam Hussein is to building a crude nuclear device, and

211
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,360
it was a crude device that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

212
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,480
You will doubt Mr. Hussein's readiness to use a nuclear weapon against American assets

213
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,800
or against Israel, if only under extreme circumstances.

214
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,400
Once Iraq becomes a nuclear power, the very decision to go to war against it would become

215
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,600
a totally different ball game.

216
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,000
Notably, Barak felt comfortable enough to reveal his battle plan, which involved deploying

217
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,840
some 300,000 American soldiers.

218
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,000
For a successful invasion of Iraq, two operational options are basically valid.

219
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,880
A surgical operation to hit the core of the regime, and a full-scale operation to include

220
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,720
major airborne and ground forces, perhaps 300,000 soldiers.

221
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,280
Saddam Hussein has set an example of defiance, especially against the first President Bush,

222
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,080
that other Arab leaders cannot and should not emulate.

223
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,720
Netanyahu wrote for The Wall Street Journal.

224
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,400
Most Americans understand that, had Al Qaeda possessed an atomic device last September,

225
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,000
the city of New York would not exist today.

226
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,640
They realized that last week we could have grieved not for thousands of dead, but for

227
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,520
millions.

228
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,720
This is a dictator who is rapidly expanding his arsenal of biological and chemical weapons,

229
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,600
who has used these weapons of mass destruction against his subjects and his neighbors, and

230
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,040
who is feverishly trying to acquire nuclear weapons.

231
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:50,040
We now know that had the democracies taken preemptive action to bring down Hitler's regime

232
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,600
in the 1930s, the worst horrors in history could have been avoided.

233
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,920
Today, nothing less than dismantling his regime will do.

234
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,640
I write this as a citizen of the country that is most endangered by a preemptive strike.

235
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,200
For in the last gasps of his dying regime, Saddam may well attempt to launch his remaining

236
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,040
missiles with their biological and chemical warheads at the Jewish state.

237
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,480
We support this American action even though we stand on the front lines, while others

238
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,120
criticize it as they sit comfortably on the side lines.

239
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,840
This hawkish rhetoric reportedly gave rise to concern among Israeli officials, writes

240
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,560
Dan Eisenberg for the Jerusalem Post.

241
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,640
In an article absent from its online archive, which I had to access via ProQuest, since

242
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,600
it has not been archived in the Wayback Machine, the date was March 10, 2003.

243
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,720
The US attack on Iraq will begin next week, but Channel 1 reported that the foreign ministries

244
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,760
receiving reports from the US that the plethora of war predictions emanating from Israeli

245
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,200
leaders is being sharply criticized by the US media, which accused them of trying to

246
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,600
go the administration into war.

247
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,400
Until now, however, Israeli officials have continuously ignored warnings from US and

248
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,000
Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, to be cautious and stop predicting

249
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,360
when the war will begin.

250
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,760
Sharon himself appeared to heed the warning, and the man who previously claimed Saddam

251
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,720
was the greatest threat to Israel, praised President Bush today for his pursuit of a

252
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,640
possible war in Iraq while seeking to disavow any Israeli involvement, writes James Bennett

253
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,480
for The New York Times.

254
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,200
The finely calibrated statement reflected concerns at the top of the government that

255
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,080
many of the worst critics in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere were identifying Israel

256
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,680
as an instigator.

257
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,720
Mr. Sharon sought to split Israel's support for a war from any responsibility for it.

258
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,120
I wish to emphasize we are not involved in this war, Mr. Sharon said in a meeting of

259
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,880
his party, Likud.

260
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,960
Looking past an Iraq war, the Defense Minister, Shah Mufaz, has urged the United States to

261
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,480
prepare to put diplomatic and economic pressures on Iran.

262
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,160
More on that later.

263
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,320
Indeed, not just Israeli officials were concerned, but also pro-Israel lobbyists in the United

264
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,280
States.

265
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,480
Dana Milbank, writing for The Washington Post, reported in November 2002 that a group of

266
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,480
U.S. political consultants has sent pro-Israel leaders a memo urging them to keep quiet while

267
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,440
the Bush administration pursues a possible war with Iraq.

268
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,040
The six-page memo was sent by the Israel Project, a group funded by American Jewish

269
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
organizations and individual donors.

270
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,840
Let American politicians fight it out on the floor of Congress and in the media,

271
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,800
the memo said.

272
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,520
If your goal is regime change, you must be more careful with your language because of

273
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,040
the potential backlash.

274
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,240
You do not want Americans to believe that the war on Iraq is being waged to protect

275
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,720
Israel rather than to protect America.

276
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,120
And it was this pro-Israel lobby in the United States that sought to tone down language implicating

277
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,440
itself in the war which it had persuaded the Bush administration to pursue.

278
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
At least that's how Mersheimer and Walt would put it.

279
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:17,040
The driving force behind the Iraq war was a small band of neo-conservatives who had long

280
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,600
favored the energetic use of American power to reshape critical areas of the world.

281
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,720
They had advocated toppling Saddam since the mid-1990s and believed this step would benefit

282
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,120
the United States and Israel alike.

283
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,360
It was the pro-Israel Thomas Friedman who told Haaretz's Ari Shavit in April 2003,

284
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,640
I could give you the names of 25 people, all of whom are at this moment within a

285
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,840
five-block radius of this office, they were in Washington DC at the time, who if you had

286
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,440
exiled them to a desert island a year and a half ago, the Iraq war would not have happened.

287
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,320
They were all affiliated with more than one think tank, comprising a network of like-minded

288
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,960
fellows and scholars who would come to hold prominent positions in the Bush administration

289
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,240
and have an influential role in American foreign policy.

290
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,680
John Bolton, who would serve as the ambassador to the United Nations, could boast being a scholar

291
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,640
for the Project for the New American Century, the American Enterprise Institute, and the

292
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,240
Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, whose advisory board also included former CIA

293
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,640
director James Woolsey and even Dick Cheney.

294
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,360
What the late William R. Polk once described as an affinity bordering on patriotism to Israel

295
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,800
among the neoconservatives is by no stretch of the imagination limited to Jews.

296
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,760
In fact, Bolton is so pro-Israel that in May 2006, Israeli ambassador to the United Nations,

297
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,200
Dan Gilerman, joked Bolton was a secret member of Israel's own team at the United Nations.

298
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,640
The secret is out, we really are not just five diplomats, we are at least six, including John

299
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,400
Bolton. After Bolton was to be reappointed in late 2006, which caused controversy among

300
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,960
Democrats and Republicans alike, one of his defenders included Malcolm Holnelein,

301
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,360
vice president of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.

302
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,600
We talked about them in my last video. The Conference of Presidents comprises the 50

303
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,880
largest organizations in the American-Israel lobby. The Jewish community remained supportive

304
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,000
and would want to see Bolton stay, Holnelein said. Mark Perlman, writing for the Forward,

305
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,920
explains, Bolton is viewed as a strong supporter of Israel and exercised the American veto last

306
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,360
week on a UN Security Council resolution condemning the killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

307
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,040
Bolton had cultivated especially close personal bonds over the years with all major Jewish groups.

308
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,400
Just how much power did the neo-conservatives have in the Bush administration?

309
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,320
Mersheimer and Walt explain, prominent officials in the Bush administration included Paul

310
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,720
Wolfowitz and Douglas Spieth, the number two and three civilians in the Pentagon,

311
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,560
Richard Perl, Kenneth Adelman and James Woolsey, members of the Influential Defense Policy Board,

312
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,360
Scooter Libby, the Vice President's Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor,

313
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,680
John Bolton, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security,

314
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,880
and his special assistant, David Wormser, and Elliot Abrams, who is in charge of Middle East

315
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:28,000
Policy at the National Security Council. Mr. Wolfowitz, considered a leader of the neo-conservatives,

316
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,200
has an informative history prior to his being appointed as Deputy Secretary of Defense.

317
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,040
Joseph Cerencioni wrote for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace just

318
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,680
one day before the US would invade Iraq on 19 March 2003.

319
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,760
Long before September 11, before the first inspections in Iraq had started,

320
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,120
a small group of influential officials and experts in Washington were calling for regime change in

321
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:02,480
Iraq. Some never wanted to end the 1991 war. Many are now administration officials. Their

322
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,240
organization, dedication, and brilliance offer much to admire, even for those who disagree with

323
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,600
the policies they advocate. Cerencioni's history begins as early as 1992. Paul Wolfowitz, then

324
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,720
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, supervised the drafting of the Defense Policy Guidance

325
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,000
document. A partially redacted version of the document is available in the National Security

326
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,560
Archive. A section titled Middle East and Southwest Asia reads, As demonstrated by Iraq's invasion

327
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,320
of Kuwait, it remains fundamentally important to prevent a hegemon or alignment of powers from

328
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,720
dominating the region. We must endeavor to curb proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological

329
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,640
weapons, as well as ballistic and cruise missiles. The infusion of new and improved conventional

330
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,760
arms and the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction during the past

331
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,280
decade have dramatically increased offensive capabilities and the risk of future wars throughout

332
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,280
the region. Excerpts from the document were subsequently leaked to the New York Times,

333
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:13,120
which caused something of a scandal. Embarrassed, the first Bush administration retracted it.

334
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,480
Its drafting had been supervised by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Pentagon's Under Secretary for

335
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,680
Policy, wrote Patrick Tyler, who goes on to explain the strong emphasis elsewhere in the

336
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,680
document and in other Pentagon planning on using military force if necessary to prevent

337
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,880
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in such countries as

338
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,760
North Korea, Iraq, some of the successor republics to the Soviet Union, and in Europe.

339
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,000
Though it was retracted, its supervisor of course became Deputy Secretary of Defense,

340
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,120
and thus the Defense Policy Guidance document was rehashed as the National Security Strategy of 2002.

341
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,840
Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass

342
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,200
destruction. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the

343
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,560
hands of the embittered few. We must defeat these threats to our nation, allies, and friends.

344
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,000
The U.S. National Security Strategy will be based on a distinctly American internationalism

345
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,280
that reflects the union of our values and our national interests. Our comprehensive strategy

346
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:31,200
to combat WMD includes proactive counter-proliferation efforts. We must deter and defend against the

347
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:40,240
threat before it is unleashed. There's also the year 1996, when Richard Perle, Douglas Feith,

348
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,760
and David Wormser, all future Bush administration officials, wrote a report which they sent to

349
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,800
the new Likud government in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu's first term as prime minister.

350
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,840
The report called for a so-called clean break, and called removing Saddam Hussein from power in

351
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:06,400
Iraq an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right. Jumping two years ahead in 1998,

352
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:13,040
18 neoconservatives wrote a letter to President Clinton urging him to aim above all at the removal

353
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:19,120
of Saddam Hussein's regime from power. That now needs to become the aim of American foreign policy.

354
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,280
Again, many, most in this case, of the signatories became officials in the Bush

355
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:31,280
administration, including Elliot Abrams, Richard Armataj, John Bolton, Paula Dobriansky, Richard

356
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:38,720
Perle, Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul Wolfowitz. In January of 2001, as George W. Bush was to be

357
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,960
sworn in as the 43rd president, the Jerusalem Post's Washington correspondent, Janine Zakaria,

358
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,480
reported on the emerging group of officials who will steer U.S.-Israel relations during the next

359
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,560
four years. She declared Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is quietly developing weapons of mass

360
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,680
destruction. Regarding Paul Wolfowitz's appointment as number two at the Pentagon,

361
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,040
pro-Israel communities are jumping for joy. Wolfowitz is considered a strong supporter of Israel.

362
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,000
He has been one of the loudest proponents of a tough policy toward Iraq,

363
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,520
focused on finding a way to bring down Saddam Hussein's regime. Jumping for joy indeed,

364
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,880
in fact, for his role in the Iraq invasion, the Jerusalem Post would name Wolfowitz Man of the

365
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:32,560
Year. No question, this was Paul Wolfowitz's year. On September 15, 2001, at a meeting in Camp

366
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:38,880
David, he advised President George W. Bush to skip Kabul and train American guns on Baghdad.

367
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,040
In the process, Wolfowitz became the most influential U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary ever.

368
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:50,720
Can you so much as name anyone else who held the post? The war in Iraq had many authors,

369
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,240
Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Tony Blair, George Bush. What's not in dispute is that

370
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,400
Wolfowitz is the principal author of the Doctrine of Preemption, which framed the war in Iraq,

371
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,600
and which, when it comes to it, will underpin U.S. action against other rogue states.

372
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,080
Following September 11, many people grasped intuitively that it was useless to contain

373
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,320
or deter foes for whom suicide was an acceptable option. The difference with Wolfowitz is that

374
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,960
he's been talking about this since at least 1992. When President Bush says America will not permit

375
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,600
the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons,

376
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:41,120
that's Wolfowitz talking. The neoconservatives had infiltrated the White House. In April of 2002,

377
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,800
a number of them would sign yet another letter, urging invasion,

378
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,600
signed most prominently by now Defense Policy Advisory Committee Chairman Richard Pearl.

379
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,520
Only the United States has the power and influence to provide meaningful assistance

380
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:03,200
to our besieged ally. Mr. President, we urge you to accelerate plans for removing Saddam Hussein

381
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,080
from power in Iraq. As you have said, every day that Saddam Hussein remains in power brings closer

382
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,800
the day when terrorists will not just have airplanes with which to attack us, but chemical,

383
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:21,920
biological, or nuclear weapons as well. It is now common knowledge that Saddam, along with Iran,

384
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,560
is a funder and supporter of terrorism against Israel. Iraq has harbored terrorists such as Abu

385
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:34,480
Nadal in the past, and it maintains links to the al-Qaeda network. If we do not move against

386
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:41,040
Saddam Hussein and his regime, the damage our Israeli friends and we have suffered until now

387
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,560
may someday appear but a prelude to much greater horrors.

388
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,560
Now, I want to go back to Janine Zakaria's article for the Jerusalem Post,

389
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,160
when she reported on the new appointees in the incoming Bush administration.

390
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,120
There's one part that will surely stick out to some of you. It's about Bush's

391
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,240
powerful Vice President Dick Cheney. Cheney is considered such a key player on foreign policy

392
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,680
that people in Washington have started to refer to his staff as a shadow National Security Council.

393
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,880
And while because of his business background, he is routinely referred to as an oil man by

394
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:24,000
people in the pro-Israel community, a moniker which translate roughly as not sympathetic to Israel.

395
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,840
I think you could make a case that on September 10th, 2001, it's not clear that George W. Bush was

396
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,000
in any fundamental way going in our direction of foreign policy.

397
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,920
That's Bill Kristol, co-founder of the Project for the New American Century,

398
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:43,360
and son of Irving Kristol, mentioned earlier by Finkelstein as a founding father of neoconservatism.

399
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,680
In fact, fellow neoconservative Jonah Goldberg described Kristol as the godfather of neoconservatism.

400
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,200
Bill Kristol also signed the 1998 letter to President Clinton urging Saddam Hussein's removal

401
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,280
and years later the 2002 letter urging Saddam Hussein's removal.

402
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,520
Sorry, just so we're clear, he is one of the most prominent neoconservatives.

403
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:10,080
I will work hard to find political solutions that allow and orderly and timely withdrawal

404
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,840
from places like Kosovo and Bosnia. We will encourage our allies to take a broader role.

405
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:25,920
We will not be hasty, but we will not be permanent peacekeepers dividing warring parties.

406
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,120
And if you read Condi Rice's article in Foreign Affairs in 1999 to 2000,

407
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,200
she was clearly the main adviser to Governor Bush. She was skeptical about a lot of these

408
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,440
claims that the U.S. really had to shape a new world order that we had to engage in nation building.

409
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,280
That article was Campaign 2000, Promoting the National Interest, published January 1st, 2000.

410
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,200
From a section titled Coping with Rogue Regimes, Saddam Hussein's regime is isolated,

411
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,000
his conventional military power has been severely weakened. The first line of defense should be

412
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,320
a clear and classical statement of deterrence. If they do acquire WMD, their weapons will be

413
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,880
unusable because any attempt to use them will bring national obliteration.

414
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,640
We are able to keep arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt.

415
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,280
The neoconservatives' role in persuading key Bush administration officials such as Cheney,

416
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,160
Bush, and Condoleezza Rice to invade Iraq are all the more apparent by the fact that

417
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:31,520
prior to September 11, there was no such commitment among them. Only nine days after

418
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,560
the 9-11 attacks, The New York Times reported a split over the scope of retaliation.

419
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,280
Some senior administration officials, led by Paul D. Wolfowitz,

420
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,360
Deputy Secretary of Defense, and I. Lewis Libby, Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney,

421
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,200
are pressing for the earliest and broadest military campaign against

422
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,240
not only the Osama Bin Laden network in Afghanistan,

423
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,440
but also against other suspected terrorist bases in Iraq and in Lebanon's Beqa region.

424
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,280
These officials are seeking to include Iraq on the target list with the aim of toppling

425
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,040
President Saddam Hussein, a step long advocated by conservatives who support Mr. Bush.

426
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,400
A number of conservatives circulated a new letter today, calling on the president to make

427
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,760
a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power, even if he cannot be linked to the

428
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,600
terrorists who struck New York and Washington last week. On Sunday, Vice President Dick Cheney

429
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,640
seemed to ally himself with Secretary Powell's view when he said in a televised interview that

430
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,080
the administration did not have evidence linking Saddam Hussein to last week's attacks. But Mr.

431
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:43,440
Wolfowitz, the Pentagon's influential deputy secretary, is a conservative thinker who has

432
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,320
frequently clashed with Secretary Powell and the State Department. He has continued to press for a

433
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,960
military campaign against Iraq that would not only punish Mr. Hussein for his past support for

434
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,560
terrorism at home and abroad, but would also eliminate the danger he poses to Israel and the

435
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:06,000
West in his quest to acquire weapons of mass destruction. What went into flipping Vice President

436
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,240
Cheney now considered one of the chief architects of the war? Mersheimer and Walt looked to his chief

437
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,240
of staff. A key part of the public relations campaign to win support for invading Iraq was the

438
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,800
manipulation of intelligence information in order to make Saddam look like an imminent threat.

439
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,720
Scooter Libby was an important player in this endeavor.

440
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,640
One need only look at the Plame Affair to see the quality of this intelligence,

441
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,320
the sludge which sloshed around Washington in the lead-up to the war.

442
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,920
Much has been said about the Camp David meeting just days after 9-11, the story of Paul Wolfowitz

443
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,240
and his obsession with Iraq, which perhaps planted the first seeds in convincing the

444
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,240
administration to topple Saddam Hussein. But aside from Wolfowitz, another powerful figure

445
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,320
was a critical mastermind that has escaped the same level of notoriety. His name is Irv Lewis

446
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,600
Libby, known by his nickname Scooter. Max Frankel of the New York Times called him

447
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,760
a poobah courtier who knew virtually all government secrets worth knowing.

448
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,200
Bob Woodward explains his influence in his investigative account of the planning for

449
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,080
the Iraq invasion. He was one of the most important players in the Bush National Security

450
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:25,920
apparatus. Libby had three formal titles. He was Chief of Staff to Vice President Cheney,

451
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,880
he was also National Security Advisor to the Vice President, and he was finally an assistant

452
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,560
to President Bush. It was a trifecta of positions probably never held before by a single person.

453
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,560
Just days after the American invasion of Iraq, Seymour Hirsch had written for The New Yorker,

454
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,640
last September 24, the argument that Iraq had a nuclear program underway was buttressed by a new

455
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,520
and striking fact. The CIA had recently received intelligence showing that between 1999 and 2001,

456
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,360
Iraq had attempted to buy 500 tons of uranium oxide from Niger, one of the world's largest

457
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:08,480
producers, known as Yellow Cake. Two weeks later, the resolution passed overwhelmingly,

458
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,560
giving the President a congressional mandate for a military assault on Iraq.

459
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,400
A former high-level intelligence official told me that the information on Niger was judged

460
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,360
serious enough to include in the President's daily brief, known as the PDB,

461
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,400
one of the most sensitive intelligence documents in the American system.

462
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,640
On March 7, Mohamed Al Baradi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency

463
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,400
in Vienna, told the UN Security Council that the documents involving the Niger-Iraq uranium sales

464
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:45,840
were fakes. The problems were glaring. One letter, dated October 10, 2000, was signed with the name

465
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:51,600
of Ellele Habibu, a Niger Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation who had been out of office

466
00:38:51,600 --> 00:39:00,480
since 1989. The attack was well underway by May 6, 2003, when Nicholas Kristoff wrote of the so-far

467
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,320
missing WMD. There are indications that the US government souped up intelligence,

468
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,320
leaned on spooks to change their conclusions, and concealed country information to deceive people

469
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,400
at home and around the world. I'm told by a person involved in the Niger caper that more than a year

470
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,680
ago, the Vice President's office asked for an investigation of the uranium deal. So a former

471
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,920
US ambassador to Africa was dispatched to Niger. In February 2002, according to someone present

472
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,640
at the meetings, that envoy reported to the CIA and State Department that the information was

473
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,640
unequivocally wrong and that the document had been forged. This unnamed former US ambassador was a

474
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,080
Joseph C. Wilson. He had been Ambo in Gabon and São Tomé, as well as head of African Affairs at

475
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,880
Bill Clinton's National Security Council. As Max Frankel explains in The New York Times,

476
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,800
Wilson's conclusions and other findings persuaded the CIA's director George Tenet to remove any

477
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,720
mention of uranium sales from a presidential speech in October 2002, but the Niger scare

478
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,000
resurfaced three months later, becoming a notorious 16 words. The British government

479
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,600
has learned the Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.

480
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,840
The war that ensued can't be described with mere words. It was, much like the current genocide

481
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:28,560
in Gaza, a punishment campaign which, for grueling decade after decade, killed perhaps one million

482
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,280
people. Not just from aerial bombardment, but, again, like Gaza now, a collapse of the healthcare

483
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,400
industry, which gave rise to waves of mass death. And Iraq was only supposed to be the first step

484
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,800
in a larger plan. A reshaping of the entire Middle East, and with outlets currently trying to tie

485
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:55,680
the Hamas incursion into Gaza on October 7th to Iran, we very well may be seeing some seeds being

486
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,800
planted. I think we should contemplate some kind of military reaction. I'm not suggesting World War

487
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,200
III. I'm not suggesting sending 100,000 Marines, but there are plenty of Iranian targets. I hope

488
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,440
I'm wrong. As I've said before, the Israel lobby is a series, and attention should be given to the

489
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,360
ambitions of the Israel lobby on a nation of 90 million people just to Iraq's East. With the

490
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:29,680
rising popularity of the neoconservatives yet again, perhaps Iran is more deserving of attention

491
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:37,120
than ever. That's for the next one. The insiders who helped define the Bush doctrine are determined

492
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:43,600
to set a course that will remake America's role in the world. They believe the removal of Saddam

493
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:53,520
Hussein is the first and necessary act of that new era. And that fateful decision to take the

494
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:05,600
nation to war now rests with the President of the United States.
