Checking GDF/The Iraq War Wasn't About Oil.txt
 The narrative you've outlined involves a series of events surrounding the lead-up to the Iraq War, with a particular focus on the controversy over the Niger uranium claims, which were used to justify the invasion. Here's a summary:

1. **Intelligence Claim**: In September 2002, The New Yorker published an article by Seymour Hersh that highlighted intelligence suggesting Iraq had attempted to purchase up to 500 tons of uranium oxide (yellowcake) from Niger between 1999 and 2001. This claim was significant because it implied Iraq was pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities, which was a key argument used to support military action against Iraq.

2. **Intelligence Briefings**: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) included this intelligence in the President's Daily Brief (PDB), indicating its seriousness and importance to policymakers.

3. **UN Resolution**: Following the publication of this information, the United States secured United Nations Resolution 1441, which authorized the use of force if Iraq did not disarm fully and immediately as demanded by the resolution.

4. **Revelation of Forgery**: In March 2003, Mohamed ElBaradi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), informed the UN Security Council that the documents claiming Iraq's attempt to purchase uranium from Niger were forgeries.

5. **Investigation and Contradiction**: A former US ambassador to Africa, Joseph C. Wilson, was sent to Niger to investigate the claims and found them to be false. His findings led to the removal of references to the Niger uranium deal from a presidential speech in October 2002. However, the claim resurfaced three months later as part of the justification for the Iraq War.

6. **War and Consequences**: The invasion of Iraq began on March 19, 2003, under the premise that Saddam Hussein's regime posed an imminent threat, including the possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), which were never found. The war led to significant human and economic costs, with a collapse of infrastructure and healthcare systems resulting in widespread loss of life.

7. **Broader Implications**: The events surrounding the Niger uranium claims and the invasion of Iraq are seen as part of a broader strategy advocated by neoconservatives to remake the Middle East. The article reflects on the role of intelligence, the influence of the Israel lobby, and the potential for further military action, particularly against Iran.

8. **Reflection and Commentary**: The author reflects on the consequences of the invasion and suggests that the decision to go to war was a choice made by President Bush, with a group of influential insiders advocating for a transformative approach to American foreign policy. The article also cautions about the potential for similar actions against Iran, influenced by the same neoconservative ideology.
