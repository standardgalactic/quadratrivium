0	10720	They called themselves neoregonites, but were willing to answer to neoconservatives or hawks.
10720	15480	Paul Wolfowitz was generally considered the brains of the outfit.
15480	21480	Paul Wolfowitz believed then that it was a mistake to end the war as we did under the
21480	24240	circumstances that we did.
24240	29480	They underestimated the way in which Saddam was able to cling to power and the means he
29480	31440	would use to remain in power.
31440	36800	That was the mistake.
36800	42640	One of the most controversial assertions made in the Israel lobby and foreign policy by
42640	48880	John Mersheimer and Stephen Walt is that members of the lobby played a principal and necessary
48880	54680	role in the plan to invade Iraq in 2003.
54680	60080	For them, they argue, the invasion would not have happened.
60080	64800	As Stephen Walt wrote years after the book was published in Foreign Affairs, even some
64800	70120	readers who were generally sympathetic to our overall position found that claim hard
70120	76320	to accept, and some left-wing critics accused us of letting Bush and Cheney off the hook
76320	82360	or of ignoring the importance of other interests, especially oil.
82360	87960	Rather than oil, the pair contend, it was a powerful group within the Israel lobby,
87960	94520	the driving force of America's hawkish interventionism and proponents of spreading democracy by the
94520	96360	barrel of the gun.
96360	102400	Or here's a less graceful description from prominent neo-conservative Michael Ladine
102400	105600	of the American Enterprise Institute.
105600	111440	Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up a small, crappy little country
111520	116720	and throw it against the wall, just to show we mean business.
116720	123120	Ladine was at one time a consultant to the U.S. National Security Council.
123120	128720	Norman Finkelstein, a key critic of Israel today, as they carry out a genocide in the
128720	133960	Gaza Strip, was at the time of the book's publishing openly at odds with Mersheimer
133960	136200	and Walt over this very issue.
136200	141320	The argument that Steve Walt and I make in our book is that the Israel lobby, again,
141320	147200	mainly the neo-conservatives, were the principal driving force in the United States behind
147200	148200	the war in Iraq.
148200	154840	Now, we argue that the lobby by itself, or the neo-conservatives by themselves, couldn't
154840	156440	make the war happen.
156440	161760	They definitely needed President Bush and Vice President Cheney to be on board.
161760	164480	And that happened after September 11th.
164480	168760	I do not think the evidence supports that claim.
168760	173560	The chief architects of the war were Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Cheney.
173560	180120	And I doubt anyone would claim that Mr. Cheney or Mr. Rumsfeld have any allegiances other
180120	182680	than to the U.S. government.
182680	187840	Not satisfied with merely debating, Mersheimer, Finkelstein devoted a chapter in his knowing
187840	194280	too much to the Iraq question, where he gives a brief but helpful history of the neo-conservatives
195280	199720	The founding fathers of neo-conservatism, such as Irving Kristol,
199720	202360	He has been called the godfather of neo-conservatives,
202360	205360	wrote the Marxist wave in the 1930s.
205360	213160	Irving Kristol, Norman Potthoritz, Midge Dector, the magazines around which they coalesced,
213160	217680	were basically partisan review and commentary.
217680	223360	When this wave crested after World War II, they joined in the liberal anti-communist witch-hunt
223360	225440	of the 1950s.
225440	230400	The neo-conservatives then rode the new left wave in the early 1960s.
230400	237000	When it crested in the mid-1960s, they again joined in the establishment backlash to it.
237000	242560	As the spectrum of respectable opinion in the U.S. shifted steadily rightward, the Jewish
242560	248200	neo-conservatives galloped yet more swiftly, eventually crossing the Rubicon from the Democratic
248200	251240	Party to the Republican Party.
251240	256880	As Finkelstein writes, the collapse of the Soviet Union shifted the focus of the neo-conservatives,
256880	261240	and indeed U.S. defense policy makers generally, on the Middle East.
261240	267960	However, he staunchly disagreed on a key argument put forth in the Israel lobby.
267960	274000	The most sensational item on Mersheimer and Waltz' charge sheet alleges that the disastrous
274000	280640	decision of the Bush administration to invade Iraq in 2003 was orchestrated by the Israel
280640	282840	lobby.
282840	289080	Finkelstein argues that if the principal architects of the war, namely George Bush, Dick Cheney,
289080	295080	and Donald Rumsfeld, were motivated by Israel, why in the first and second-hand accounts
295080	300360	of the pre-war behind-the-scenes debates of the Bush administration, Israel barely gets
300360	302680	a passing mention.
302680	305400	Finkelstein looks to their memoirs.
305400	310600	In her memoir No Higher Honor, Condoleezza Rice, who was national security advisor in
310600	316520	the Bush administration, does not list or even allude to Israeli security as the or
316520	320080	even a motive behind the attack.
320080	325240	In his memoir Known and Unknown, Donald Rumsfeld, who was secretary of defense in the Bush
325240	331240	administration, also does not list or even allude to Israeli security as the or even
331240	334080	a motive behind the attack.
334080	339760	In his memoir In My Time, Dick Cheney, who was vice president in the Bush administration,
339760	345360	also does not list or even allude to Israeli security as the or even a motive behind the
345360	347800	attack.
347800	352760	If the Israel lobby played such a critical role in the decision to attack Iraq, how
352760	356600	was it able to so effectively cover its tracks?
356600	361600	One could understand why Cheney et al might want to conceal that oil was the impetus behind
361600	367040	the attack, but it is unclear what motive they would have to conceal the Israel lobby's
367040	368040	role.
368040	370560	It's a good question.
370560	375240	If Israel played an important role in the decision to invade Iraq, one would think that
375240	380000	this would be mentioned in the various memoirs of the perpetrators.
380000	384760	In Mersheimer and Waltz book, they quote, knowledgeable and well-respected individuals
384760	389760	who had said openly that the war was linked with Israel's security.
390080	396280	Beginning with a Philip Zellico In September of 2002, Zellico was a member
396280	402560	of the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, known to insiders as PIFIAB.
402560	407080	He would also serve as executive director of the 9-11 Commission and as counselor to
407080	409200	Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
409200	412680	They've also written at least two books together.
412680	418400	His words before an audience at the University of Virginia on September 10, 2002, were first
418400	423120	reported by Imad McKay of the Interpress Service in 2004.
423120	429680	While speaking on a panel of foreign policy experts, Zellico said the following statements.
429680	431280	The unstated threat.
431280	435520	And here I criticized the Bush administration a little because the argument that they make
435520	439840	over and over again is that this is about a threat to the United States.
439840	444200	And then everybody says, show me an imminent threat from Iraq to America.
444200	450160	Show me, why would Iraq attack America or use nuclear weapons against us?
450160	453080	So I'll tell you what I think the real threat is.
453080	456360	It actually has been since 1990.
456360	458680	It's the threat against Israel.
458680	463360	And this is the threat that dare not speak its name because the Europeans don't care
463360	467160	deeply about that threat, I will tell you frankly.
467160	472320	And the American government doesn't want to lean too hard on it rhetorically because
472360	475480	it's not a popular cell.
475480	478280	Zellico names a familiar foe.
478280	484280	If the danger is a biological weapon handed to Hamas, then what's the American alternative
484280	485480	then?
485480	487480	Play out those scenarios.
487480	490200	Don't look at the ties between Iraq and al-Qaeda.
490200	495840	But then ask yourself the question, G is Iraq tied to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic
495840	499800	jihad and the people who carry out suicide bombings in Israel?
499920	504520	Easy question to answer and the evidence is abundant.
504520	506080	Zellico was right.
506080	511320	In an October 2002 Human Rights Watch report on Palestinian suicide bombings during the
511320	516840	Second Antifada, they note that Saddam Hussein's government provides funds to families of martyrs
516840	522320	and others and has established a differential in which families of suicide bombing operatives
522320	528080	are said to receive a considerably larger sum of $25,000 while other families that have
528080	531800	suffered a death receive $10,000.
531800	536600	Iraq provides these monies through the local Bath Party-affiliated Arab Liberation Front
536600	537960	or ALF.
537960	543560	The ALF is a constituent member of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
543560	546800	They cite an informative article from the Sydney Morning Herald.
546800	551320	Its author, Paul McHugh, interviewed the Arab Liberation Front's Secretary General,
551320	556920	Raqqat Saleh, who confirmed that since late 2000, more than 800 families have received
556920	559640	martyr payments of $10,000.
559640	565360	It's transferred by the banks, he said, from the Iraqi banks to the banks in Palestine.
565360	570200	Philip Zellico was not happy with Mersheimer and Walt publishing his quote in the original
570200	572480	article which later became the book.
572480	576200	In the end notes of the subsequent book, Mersheimer and Walt write,
576200	581600	We used these quotations in our original article in the London Review of Books and Zellico
581600	584360	challenged our interpretation of them.
584360	589360	We based our discussion on a full and unimpeachable record of his remarks and his challenge has
589360	591280	no basis in fact.
591280	598840	Ironically, Zellico appears to have been proving the point made in his original speech.
598840	603600	As we saw earlier, Finkelstein's skepticism of Mersheimer-Walt's argument includes the
603600	608240	fact that there is no mention of Israel as a motivation for invading Iraq in the memoirs
608240	611960	of Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and others.
611960	616720	But should that not itself elicit pause and skepticism?
616720	622840	In his decision points, George W. Bush recalls a meeting with British Premier Tony Blair
622840	625480	in April of 2002.
625480	630320	In April 2002, Tony and Sherry visited Lor and me in Crawford.
630320	635200	Tony and I talked about coercive diplomacy as a way to address the threat from Iraq.
635200	639880	Tony suggested that we seek a UN Security Council resolution that presented Saddam with
639880	641720	a clear ultimatum.
641720	646040	Allow weapons inspectors back into Iraq or face serious consequences.
646040	651760	As I recall that discussion, it was less to do with specifics about what we were going
651760	656800	to do on Iraq or indeed the Middle East because the Israel issue was a big, big issue at
656800	657800	the time.
657800	664240	In fact, I think I remember actually there may have been conversations that we had even
664240	667520	with Israelis, the two of us, whilst we were there.
667520	670000	So that was a major part of all this.
670000	676400	But the principal part of my conversation, we've got to deal with the various different
676400	678560	dimensions of this whole issue.
678560	684720	As we can clearly see, Blair provides details peculiarly absent from Bush's telling.
684720	689160	Bush also railed against his critics in his memoir, saying some alleged that America's
689160	693960	real intent was to control Iraq's oil or satisfy Israel.
693960	695480	Those theories were false.
695480	699880	I was sending our troops into combat to protect the American people.
699920	704920	Saddam refused to cooperate with weapons inspectors, even with the threat of an invasion on his
704920	706240	doorstep.
706240	710720	The only logical conclusion was that he was hiding WMD.
710720	715760	Despite an October 2003 Congressional Research Service report, which noted that from late
715760	723680	November 2002 to March 2003, UN inspectors combed Iraq looking for weapons of mass destruction,
723680	728960	conducting over 750 inspections at 550 sites.
728960	733000	There's also the findings of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's report on Iraq
733000	736320	WMD published in 2004.
736320	741000	One of the committee's members, the late Dianne Feinstein, stated in no uncertain terms
741000	746560	the state of Iraq's so-called nuclear program in the lead up to the invasion.
746560	751120	I think it is clear that there was not an ongoing nuclear program.
751120	756960	In August of 2002, prior to the vote in the Senate on the authorization to go to war,
756960	761840	I spent a day in Vienna at the International Atomic Energy Agency.
761840	766600	The IAEA is the agency that runs nuclear inspections.
766600	770520	They saw no signs of a nuclear program in Iraq.
770520	776600	The IAEA convinced me that there was no ongoing nuclear program in Iraq.
776600	781640	The intelligence reporting on a possible Iraqi nuclear program did not have an impact on
781640	785000	me because I did not believe it was correct.
785000	788280	Though she still voted for the war oddly enough.
788280	793480	The reason for the Bush administration's quietness about the role of Israel in the planning
793480	798800	is evidenced by a revealing article in the Jewish Forward newspaper.
798800	803080	The article is absent from both its English language and Yiddish language archives.
803080	806680	It took some serious digging to find, actually, oddly enough, though Internet archive finally
806680	808600	came through with the right maneuvering.
808600	813360	It's called Iraqi Move Puts Israel in Lonely U.S. Corner.
813360	819360	And it was written by Mark Perlman for the week of September 20, 2002 edition.
819360	824560	In contrast to Bush's memoir alleging Saddam refused to cooperate with weapons inspectors
824560	830440	with the only logical conclusion being Saddam possessed WMD, Saddam Hussein's surprise
830440	836320	acceptance of unconditional United Nations weapons inspections put Israel in the hot seat
836320	842560	this week, forcing it into the open as the only nation actively supporting the Bush administration's
842560	846520	goal of Iraqi regime change.
846520	851680	Israel's diffident stance appeared untenable this week after most capitals welcomed the
851680	857760	Iraqi announcement Monday that it would accept the return of weapons inspectors without conditions.
857760	864280	Further, Perlman writes, Israel and its supporters have insisted for weeks that while they sympathize
864280	869440	with the administration's hardline stance toward Baghdad, they were reluctant to advocate
869440	871760	any position openly.
871760	876640	The reluctance was fueled by fears that critics would claim the United States was going to
876640	883160	war on Israel's behalf, or even, as some have suggested, at Israel's behest.
883160	887840	These concerns came a month after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told the Knesset Foreign Affairs
887840	892960	and Defense Committee that Iraq is the greatest danger facing Israel.
892960	897880	Though he clarified, we aren't intervening in U.S. decisions, but he said that strategic
897880	904360	coordination between Israel and the U.S. has reached unprecedented dimensions.
904360	909760	Days later, Aluf Ben reported for Haaretz, Israel is pressing the United States not to
909760	914280	defer action aimed at toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.
914280	920040	Quoting Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, the problem today is not if, but when.
920040	926280	Adding that while attacking now would be quite dangerous, postponing it would be more dangerous.
926280	932320	Aluf Ben continues, but like Sharon, Peres also added a disclaimer, saying he did not
932320	936880	want to be seen as urging the United States to act and that America should act according
936880	938600	to its own judgment.
938600	946680	Israel, he said, will be a good soldier in the camp led by President George W. Bush.
946680	951480	The appetite for war among Israeli officials was on open display.
951480	957720	Foreign Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Benjamin Netanyahu wrote op-eds urging invasion.
957720	964040	Barak wrote for The New York Times, an article titled Taking Apart Iraq's Nuclear Threat.
964040	968320	Those who prefer to wait and hope for the best should contemplate the following.
968320	973080	No one really knows how close Saddam Hussein is to building a crude nuclear device, and
973080	978360	it was a crude device that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
978360	983480	You will doubt Mr. Hussein's readiness to use a nuclear weapon against American assets
983480	988800	or against Israel, if only under extreme circumstances.
988800	993400	Once Iraq becomes a nuclear power, the very decision to go to war against it would become
993400	995600	a totally different ball game.
995600	1001000	Notably, Barak felt comfortable enough to reveal his battle plan, which involved deploying
1001000	1004840	some 300,000 American soldiers.
1004840	1010000	For a successful invasion of Iraq, two operational options are basically valid.
1010000	1014880	A surgical operation to hit the core of the regime, and a full-scale operation to include
1014880	1020720	major airborne and ground forces, perhaps 300,000 soldiers.
1020720	1026280	Saddam Hussein has set an example of defiance, especially against the first President Bush,
1026280	1032080	that other Arab leaders cannot and should not emulate.
1032200	1035720	Netanyahu wrote for The Wall Street Journal.
1035720	1041400	Most Americans understand that, had Al Qaeda possessed an atomic device last September,
1041400	1045000	the city of New York would not exist today.
1045000	1049640	They realized that last week we could have grieved not for thousands of dead, but for
1049640	1051520	millions.
1051520	1056720	This is a dictator who is rapidly expanding his arsenal of biological and chemical weapons,
1056720	1061600	who has used these weapons of mass destruction against his subjects and his neighbors, and
1061600	1065040	who is feverishly trying to acquire nuclear weapons.
1065040	1070040	We now know that had the democracies taken preemptive action to bring down Hitler's regime
1070040	1074600	in the 1930s, the worst horrors in history could have been avoided.
1074600	1078920	Today, nothing less than dismantling his regime will do.
1078920	1084640	I write this as a citizen of the country that is most endangered by a preemptive strike.
1084640	1089200	For in the last gasps of his dying regime, Saddam may well attempt to launch his remaining
1089240	1095040	missiles with their biological and chemical warheads at the Jewish state.
1095040	1100480	We support this American action even though we stand on the front lines, while others
1100480	1107120	criticize it as they sit comfortably on the side lines.
1107120	1111840	This hawkish rhetoric reportedly gave rise to concern among Israeli officials, writes
1111840	1114560	Dan Eisenberg for the Jerusalem Post.
1114560	1119640	In an article absent from its online archive, which I had to access via ProQuest, since
1119640	1125600	it has not been archived in the Wayback Machine, the date was March 10, 2003.
1125600	1130720	The US attack on Iraq will begin next week, but Channel 1 reported that the foreign ministries
1130720	1135760	receiving reports from the US that the plethora of war predictions emanating from Israeli
1135760	1141200	leaders is being sharply criticized by the US media, which accused them of trying to
1141280	1143600	go the administration into war.
1143600	1148400	Until now, however, Israeli officials have continuously ignored warnings from US and
1148400	1154000	Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, to be cautious and stop predicting
1154000	1157360	when the war will begin.
1157360	1161760	Sharon himself appeared to heed the warning, and the man who previously claimed Saddam
1161760	1166720	was the greatest threat to Israel, praised President Bush today for his pursuit of a
1166800	1172640	possible war in Iraq while seeking to disavow any Israeli involvement, writes James Bennett
1172640	1174480	for The New York Times.
1174480	1179200	The finely calibrated statement reflected concerns at the top of the government that
1179200	1184080	many of the worst critics in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere were identifying Israel
1184080	1185680	as an instigator.
1185680	1190720	Mr. Sharon sought to split Israel's support for a war from any responsibility for it.
1190720	1195120	I wish to emphasize we are not involved in this war, Mr. Sharon said in a meeting of
1195120	1196880	his party, Likud.
1196880	1202960	Looking past an Iraq war, the Defense Minister, Shah Mufaz, has urged the United States to
1202960	1206480	prepare to put diplomatic and economic pressures on Iran.
1207280	1208160	More on that later.
1209200	1214320	Indeed, not just Israeli officials were concerned, but also pro-Israel lobbyists in the United
1214320	1215280	States.
1215280	1220480	Dana Milbank, writing for The Washington Post, reported in November 2002 that a group of
1220560	1226480	U.S. political consultants has sent pro-Israel leaders a memo urging them to keep quiet while
1226480	1229440	the Bush administration pursues a possible war with Iraq.
1230080	1235040	The six-page memo was sent by the Israel Project, a group funded by American Jewish
1235040	1237040	organizations and individual donors.
1237680	1241840	Let American politicians fight it out on the floor of Congress and in the media,
1241840	1242800	the memo said.
1242800	1247520	If your goal is regime change, you must be more careful with your language because of
1247520	1249040	the potential backlash.
1249600	1254240	You do not want Americans to believe that the war on Iraq is being waged to protect
1254240	1256720	Israel rather than to protect America.
1257360	1263120	And it was this pro-Israel lobby in the United States that sought to tone down language implicating
1263120	1267440	itself in the war which it had persuaded the Bush administration to pursue.
1268240	1270240	At least that's how Mersheimer and Walt would put it.
1271040	1277040	The driving force behind the Iraq war was a small band of neo-conservatives who had long
1277040	1281600	favored the energetic use of American power to reshape critical areas of the world.
1282160	1288720	They had advocated toppling Saddam since the mid-1990s and believed this step would benefit
1288720	1291120	the United States and Israel alike.
1293920	1299360	It was the pro-Israel Thomas Friedman who told Haaretz's Ari Shavit in April 2003,
1299920	1304640	I could give you the names of 25 people, all of whom are at this moment within a
1304640	1309840	five-block radius of this office, they were in Washington DC at the time, who if you had
1309840	1315440	exiled them to a desert island a year and a half ago, the Iraq war would not have happened.
1317360	1322320	They were all affiliated with more than one think tank, comprising a network of like-minded
1322320	1326960	fellows and scholars who would come to hold prominent positions in the Bush administration
1326960	1330240	and have an influential role in American foreign policy.
1330560	1335680	John Bolton, who would serve as the ambassador to the United Nations, could boast being a scholar
1335680	1340640	for the Project for the New American Century, the American Enterprise Institute, and the
1340640	1346240	Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, whose advisory board also included former CIA
1346240	1348640	director James Woolsey and even Dick Cheney.
1349360	1355360	What the late William R. Polk once described as an affinity bordering on patriotism to Israel
1355440	1360800	among the neoconservatives is by no stretch of the imagination limited to Jews.
1362080	1367760	In fact, Bolton is so pro-Israel that in May 2006, Israeli ambassador to the United Nations,
1367760	1373200	Dan Gilerman, joked Bolton was a secret member of Israel's own team at the United Nations.
1373200	1378640	The secret is out, we really are not just five diplomats, we are at least six, including John
1378640	1384400	Bolton. After Bolton was to be reappointed in late 2006, which caused controversy among
1384400	1388960	Democrats and Republicans alike, one of his defenders included Malcolm Holnelein,
1388960	1393360	vice president of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
1393360	1397600	We talked about them in my last video. The Conference of Presidents comprises the 50
1397600	1402880	largest organizations in the American-Israel lobby. The Jewish community remained supportive
1402880	1408000	and would want to see Bolton stay, Holnelein said. Mark Perlman, writing for the Forward,
1408000	1413920	explains, Bolton is viewed as a strong supporter of Israel and exercised the American veto last
1413920	1419360	week on a UN Security Council resolution condemning the killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
1419360	1425040	Bolton had cultivated especially close personal bonds over the years with all major Jewish groups.
1426160	1430400	Just how much power did the neo-conservatives have in the Bush administration?
1431120	1436320	Mersheimer and Walt explain, prominent officials in the Bush administration included Paul
1436320	1440720	Wolfowitz and Douglas Spieth, the number two and three civilians in the Pentagon,
1440720	1446560	Richard Perl, Kenneth Adelman and James Woolsey, members of the Influential Defense Policy Board,
1446560	1451360	Scooter Libby, the Vice President's Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor,
1451360	1455680	John Bolton, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security,
1455680	1460880	and his special assistant, David Wormser, and Elliot Abrams, who is in charge of Middle East
1460880	1468000	Policy at the National Security Council. Mr. Wolfowitz, considered a leader of the neo-conservatives,
1468000	1473200	has an informative history prior to his being appointed as Deputy Secretary of Defense.
1474400	1479040	Joseph Cerencioni wrote for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace just
1479040	1483680	one day before the US would invade Iraq on 19 March 2003.
1485120	1489760	Long before September 11, before the first inspections in Iraq had started,
1489760	1495120	a small group of influential officials and experts in Washington were calling for regime change in
1495120	1502480	Iraq. Some never wanted to end the 1991 war. Many are now administration officials. Their
1502480	1508240	organization, dedication, and brilliance offer much to admire, even for those who disagree with
1508240	1515600	the policies they advocate. Cerencioni's history begins as early as 1992. Paul Wolfowitz, then
1515600	1520720	Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, supervised the drafting of the Defense Policy Guidance
1520720	1526000	document. A partially redacted version of the document is available in the National Security
1526000	1532560	Archive. A section titled Middle East and Southwest Asia reads, As demonstrated by Iraq's invasion
1532560	1538320	of Kuwait, it remains fundamentally important to prevent a hegemon or alignment of powers from
1538320	1544720	dominating the region. We must endeavor to curb proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological
1544720	1550640	weapons, as well as ballistic and cruise missiles. The infusion of new and improved conventional
1550640	1555760	arms and the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction during the past
1555760	1561280	decade have dramatically increased offensive capabilities and the risk of future wars throughout
1561280	1567280	the region. Excerpts from the document were subsequently leaked to the New York Times,
1567280	1573120	which caused something of a scandal. Embarrassed, the first Bush administration retracted it.
1573200	1578480	Its drafting had been supervised by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Pentagon's Under Secretary for
1578480	1583680	Policy, wrote Patrick Tyler, who goes on to explain the strong emphasis elsewhere in the
1583680	1589680	document and in other Pentagon planning on using military force if necessary to prevent
1589680	1594880	the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in such countries as
1594880	1599760	North Korea, Iraq, some of the successor republics to the Soviet Union, and in Europe.
1600720	1606000	Though it was retracted, its supervisor of course became Deputy Secretary of Defense,
1606000	1613120	and thus the Defense Policy Guidance document was rehashed as the National Security Strategy of 2002.
1614400	1619840	Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass
1619840	1625200	destruction. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the
1625200	1630560	hands of the embittered few. We must defeat these threats to our nation, allies, and friends.
1631760	1638000	The U.S. National Security Strategy will be based on a distinctly American internationalism
1638000	1643280	that reflects the union of our values and our national interests. Our comprehensive strategy
1643280	1651200	to combat WMD includes proactive counter-proliferation efforts. We must deter and defend against the
1651200	1660240	threat before it is unleashed. There's also the year 1996, when Richard Perle, Douglas Feith,
1660240	1665760	and David Wormser, all future Bush administration officials, wrote a report which they sent to
1665760	1670800	the new Likud government in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu's first term as prime minister.
1671760	1677840	The report called for a so-called clean break, and called removing Saddam Hussein from power in
1677840	1686400	Iraq an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right. Jumping two years ahead in 1998,
1686400	1693040	18 neoconservatives wrote a letter to President Clinton urging him to aim above all at the removal
1693040	1699120	of Saddam Hussein's regime from power. That now needs to become the aim of American foreign policy.
1700800	1705280	Again, many, most in this case, of the signatories became officials in the Bush
1705280	1711280	administration, including Elliot Abrams, Richard Armataj, John Bolton, Paula Dobriansky, Richard
1711280	1718720	Perle, Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul Wolfowitz. In January of 2001, as George W. Bush was to be
1718720	1724960	sworn in as the 43rd president, the Jerusalem Post's Washington correspondent, Janine Zakaria,
1724960	1730480	reported on the emerging group of officials who will steer U.S.-Israel relations during the next
1730480	1736560	four years. She declared Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is quietly developing weapons of mass
1736560	1741680	destruction. Regarding Paul Wolfowitz's appointment as number two at the Pentagon,
1742320	1749040	pro-Israel communities are jumping for joy. Wolfowitz is considered a strong supporter of Israel.
1749680	1754000	He has been one of the loudest proponents of a tough policy toward Iraq,
1754000	1759520	focused on finding a way to bring down Saddam Hussein's regime. Jumping for joy indeed,
1759520	1764880	in fact, for his role in the Iraq invasion, the Jerusalem Post would name Wolfowitz Man of the
1764880	1772560	Year. No question, this was Paul Wolfowitz's year. On September 15, 2001, at a meeting in Camp
1772560	1778880	David, he advised President George W. Bush to skip Kabul and train American guns on Baghdad.
1779520	1785040	In the process, Wolfowitz became the most influential U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary ever.
1785040	1790720	Can you so much as name anyone else who held the post? The war in Iraq had many authors,
1790720	1796240	Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Tony Blair, George Bush. What's not in dispute is that
1796240	1802400	Wolfowitz is the principal author of the Doctrine of Preemption, which framed the war in Iraq,
1802400	1807600	and which, when it comes to it, will underpin U.S. action against other rogue states.
1808240	1814080	Following September 11, many people grasped intuitively that it was useless to contain
1814080	1820320	or deter foes for whom suicide was an acceptable option. The difference with Wolfowitz is that
1820320	1826960	he's been talking about this since at least 1992. When President Bush says America will not permit
1826960	1831600	the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons,
1832160	1841120	that's Wolfowitz talking. The neoconservatives had infiltrated the White House. In April of 2002,
1841120	1844800	a number of them would sign yet another letter, urging invasion,
1844800	1849600	signed most prominently by now Defense Policy Advisory Committee Chairman Richard Pearl.
1850720	1855520	Only the United States has the power and influence to provide meaningful assistance
1855520	1863200	to our besieged ally. Mr. President, we urge you to accelerate plans for removing Saddam Hussein
1863200	1870080	from power in Iraq. As you have said, every day that Saddam Hussein remains in power brings closer
1870080	1874800	the day when terrorists will not just have airplanes with which to attack us, but chemical,
1874800	1881920	biological, or nuclear weapons as well. It is now common knowledge that Saddam, along with Iran,
1881920	1888560	is a funder and supporter of terrorism against Israel. Iraq has harbored terrorists such as Abu
1888560	1894480	Nadal in the past, and it maintains links to the al-Qaeda network. If we do not move against
1894480	1901040	Saddam Hussein and his regime, the damage our Israeli friends and we have suffered until now
1901040	1904560	may someday appear but a prelude to much greater horrors.
1906400	1910560	Now, I want to go back to Janine Zakaria's article for the Jerusalem Post,
1910560	1914160	when she reported on the new appointees in the incoming Bush administration.
1914880	1919120	There's one part that will surely stick out to some of you. It's about Bush's
1919120	1926240	powerful Vice President Dick Cheney. Cheney is considered such a key player on foreign policy
1926240	1931680	that people in Washington have started to refer to his staff as a shadow National Security Council.
1932320	1936880	And while because of his business background, he is routinely referred to as an oil man by
1936880	1944000	people in the pro-Israel community, a moniker which translate roughly as not sympathetic to Israel.
1944000	1949840	I think you could make a case that on September 10th, 2001, it's not clear that George W. Bush was
1950400	1954000	in any fundamental way going in our direction of foreign policy.
1954000	1957920	That's Bill Kristol, co-founder of the Project for the New American Century,
1957920	1963360	and son of Irving Kristol, mentioned earlier by Finkelstein as a founding father of neoconservatism.
1963360	1969680	In fact, fellow neoconservative Jonah Goldberg described Kristol as the godfather of neoconservatism.
1969760	1975200	Bill Kristol also signed the 1998 letter to President Clinton urging Saddam Hussein's removal
1975200	1979280	and years later the 2002 letter urging Saddam Hussein's removal.
1979280	1983520	Sorry, just so we're clear, he is one of the most prominent neoconservatives.
1983520	1990080	I will work hard to find political solutions that allow and orderly and timely withdrawal
1990880	1997840	from places like Kosovo and Bosnia. We will encourage our allies to take a broader role.
1998800	2005920	We will not be hasty, but we will not be permanent peacekeepers dividing warring parties.
2006800	2011120	And if you read Condi Rice's article in Foreign Affairs in 1999 to 2000,
2011840	2017200	she was clearly the main adviser to Governor Bush. She was skeptical about a lot of these
2017760	2023440	claims that the U.S. really had to shape a new world order that we had to engage in nation building.
2023440	2029280	That article was Campaign 2000, Promoting the National Interest, published January 1st, 2000.
2030080	2035200	From a section titled Coping with Rogue Regimes, Saddam Hussein's regime is isolated,
2035200	2040000	his conventional military power has been severely weakened. The first line of defense should be
2040000	2046320	a clear and classical statement of deterrence. If they do acquire WMD, their weapons will be
2046320	2050880	unusable because any attempt to use them will bring national obliteration.
2051600	2056640	We are able to keep arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt.
2056640	2061280	The neoconservatives' role in persuading key Bush administration officials such as Cheney,
2061280	2066160	Bush, and Condoleezza Rice to invade Iraq are all the more apparent by the fact that
2066160	2071520	prior to September 11, there was no such commitment among them. Only nine days after
2071520	2076560	the 9-11 attacks, The New York Times reported a split over the scope of retaliation.
2077440	2081280	Some senior administration officials, led by Paul D. Wolfowitz,
2081280	2087360	Deputy Secretary of Defense, and I. Lewis Libby, Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney,
2087360	2091200	are pressing for the earliest and broadest military campaign against
2091200	2094240	not only the Osama Bin Laden network in Afghanistan,
2094240	2099440	but also against other suspected terrorist bases in Iraq and in Lebanon's Beqa region.
2100240	2105280	These officials are seeking to include Iraq on the target list with the aim of toppling
2105280	2111040	President Saddam Hussein, a step long advocated by conservatives who support Mr. Bush.
2112000	2116400	A number of conservatives circulated a new letter today, calling on the president to make
2116400	2121760	a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power, even if he cannot be linked to the
2121760	2127600	terrorists who struck New York and Washington last week. On Sunday, Vice President Dick Cheney
2127600	2132640	seemed to ally himself with Secretary Powell's view when he said in a televised interview that
2132640	2138080	the administration did not have evidence linking Saddam Hussein to last week's attacks. But Mr.
2138080	2143440	Wolfowitz, the Pentagon's influential deputy secretary, is a conservative thinker who has
2143440	2148320	frequently clashed with Secretary Powell and the State Department. He has continued to press for a
2148320	2152960	military campaign against Iraq that would not only punish Mr. Hussein for his past support for
2152960	2158560	terrorism at home and abroad, but would also eliminate the danger he poses to Israel and the
2158560	2166000	West in his quest to acquire weapons of mass destruction. What went into flipping Vice President
2166000	2172240	Cheney now considered one of the chief architects of the war? Mersheimer and Walt looked to his chief
2172240	2178240	of staff. A key part of the public relations campaign to win support for invading Iraq was the
2178240	2182800	manipulation of intelligence information in order to make Saddam look like an imminent threat.
2183600	2186720	Scooter Libby was an important player in this endeavor.
2188240	2192640	One need only look at the Plame Affair to see the quality of this intelligence,
2192640	2196320	the sludge which sloshed around Washington in the lead-up to the war.
2198400	2203920	Much has been said about the Camp David meeting just days after 9-11, the story of Paul Wolfowitz
2203920	2208240	and his obsession with Iraq, which perhaps planted the first seeds in convincing the
2208240	2214240	administration to topple Saddam Hussein. But aside from Wolfowitz, another powerful figure
2214240	2220320	was a critical mastermind that has escaped the same level of notoriety. His name is Irv Lewis
2220320	2225600	Libby, known by his nickname Scooter. Max Frankel of the New York Times called him
2225600	2229760	a poobah courtier who knew virtually all government secrets worth knowing.
2231040	2235200	Bob Woodward explains his influence in his investigative account of the planning for
2235200	2240080	the Iraq invasion. He was one of the most important players in the Bush National Security
2240080	2245920	apparatus. Libby had three formal titles. He was Chief of Staff to Vice President Cheney,
2245920	2250880	he was also National Security Advisor to the Vice President, and he was finally an assistant
2250880	2256560	to President Bush. It was a trifecta of positions probably never held before by a single person.
2257760	2262560	Just days after the American invasion of Iraq, Seymour Hirsch had written for The New Yorker,
2263120	2268640	last September 24, the argument that Iraq had a nuclear program underway was buttressed by a new
2268640	2275520	and striking fact. The CIA had recently received intelligence showing that between 1999 and 2001,
2275520	2281360	Iraq had attempted to buy 500 tons of uranium oxide from Niger, one of the world's largest
2281360	2288480	producers, known as Yellow Cake. Two weeks later, the resolution passed overwhelmingly,
2288560	2292560	giving the President a congressional mandate for a military assault on Iraq.
2293600	2298400	A former high-level intelligence official told me that the information on Niger was judged
2298400	2303360	serious enough to include in the President's daily brief, known as the PDB,
2303360	2306400	one of the most sensitive intelligence documents in the American system.
2307040	2312640	On March 7, Mohamed Al Baradi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency
2312640	2318400	in Vienna, told the UN Security Council that the documents involving the Niger-Iraq uranium sales
2318560	2325840	were fakes. The problems were glaring. One letter, dated October 10, 2000, was signed with the name
2325840	2331600	of Ellele Habibu, a Niger Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation who had been out of office
2331600	2340480	since 1989. The attack was well underway by May 6, 2003, when Nicholas Kristoff wrote of the so-far
2340480	2346320	missing WMD. There are indications that the US government souped up intelligence,
2346400	2352320	leaned on spooks to change their conclusions, and concealed country information to deceive people
2352320	2358400	at home and around the world. I'm told by a person involved in the Niger caper that more than a year
2358400	2363680	ago, the Vice President's office asked for an investigation of the uranium deal. So a former
2363680	2369920	US ambassador to Africa was dispatched to Niger. In February 2002, according to someone present
2369920	2374640	at the meetings, that envoy reported to the CIA and State Department that the information was
2374640	2380640	unequivocally wrong and that the document had been forged. This unnamed former US ambassador was a
2380640	2386080	Joseph C. Wilson. He had been Ambo in Gabon and São Tomé, as well as head of African Affairs at
2386080	2390880	Bill Clinton's National Security Council. As Max Frankel explains in The New York Times,
2390880	2396800	Wilson's conclusions and other findings persuaded the CIA's director George Tenet to remove any
2396800	2402720	mention of uranium sales from a presidential speech in October 2002, but the Niger scare
2402720	2408000	resurfaced three months later, becoming a notorious 16 words. The British government
2408000	2413600	has learned the Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.
2415120	2421840	The war that ensued can't be described with mere words. It was, much like the current genocide
2421840	2428560	in Gaza, a punishment campaign which, for grueling decade after decade, killed perhaps one million
2428560	2435280	people. Not just from aerial bombardment, but, again, like Gaza now, a collapse of the healthcare
2435280	2442400	industry, which gave rise to waves of mass death. And Iraq was only supposed to be the first step
2442400	2448800	in a larger plan. A reshaping of the entire Middle East, and with outlets currently trying to tie
2448800	2455680	the Hamas incursion into Gaza on October 7th to Iran, we very well may be seeing some seeds being
2455760	2462800	planted. I think we should contemplate some kind of military reaction. I'm not suggesting World War
2462800	2469200	III. I'm not suggesting sending 100,000 Marines, but there are plenty of Iranian targets. I hope
2469200	2475440	I'm wrong. As I've said before, the Israel lobby is a series, and attention should be given to the
2475440	2481360	ambitions of the Israel lobby on a nation of 90 million people just to Iraq's East. With the
2481360	2489680	rising popularity of the neoconservatives yet again, perhaps Iran is more deserving of attention
2489680	2497120	than ever. That's for the next one. The insiders who helped define the Bush doctrine are determined
2497120	2503600	to set a course that will remake America's role in the world. They believe the removal of Saddam
2503600	2513520	Hussein is the first and necessary act of that new era. And that fateful decision to take the
2513520	2525600	nation to war now rests with the President of the United States.
