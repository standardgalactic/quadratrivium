WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.720
They called themselves neoregonites, but were willing to answer to neoconservatives or hawks.

00:10.720 --> 00:15.480
Paul Wolfowitz was generally considered the brains of the outfit.

00:15.480 --> 00:21.480
Paul Wolfowitz believed then that it was a mistake to end the war as we did under the

00:21.480 --> 00:24.240
circumstances that we did.

00:24.240 --> 00:29.480
They underestimated the way in which Saddam was able to cling to power and the means he

00:29.480 --> 00:31.440
would use to remain in power.

00:31.440 --> 00:36.800
That was the mistake.

00:36.800 --> 00:42.640
One of the most controversial assertions made in the Israel lobby and foreign policy by

00:42.640 --> 00:48.880
John Mersheimer and Stephen Walt is that members of the lobby played a principal and necessary

00:48.880 --> 00:54.680
role in the plan to invade Iraq in 2003.

00:54.680 --> 01:00.080
For them, they argue, the invasion would not have happened.

01:00.080 --> 01:04.800
As Stephen Walt wrote years after the book was published in Foreign Affairs, even some

01:04.800 --> 01:10.120
readers who were generally sympathetic to our overall position found that claim hard

01:10.120 --> 01:16.320
to accept, and some left-wing critics accused us of letting Bush and Cheney off the hook

01:16.320 --> 01:22.360
or of ignoring the importance of other interests, especially oil.

01:22.360 --> 01:27.960
Rather than oil, the pair contend, it was a powerful group within the Israel lobby,

01:27.960 --> 01:34.520
the driving force of America's hawkish interventionism and proponents of spreading democracy by the

01:34.520 --> 01:36.360
barrel of the gun.

01:36.360 --> 01:42.400
Or here's a less graceful description from prominent neo-conservative Michael Ladine

01:42.400 --> 01:45.600
of the American Enterprise Institute.

01:45.600 --> 01:51.440
Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up a small, crappy little country

01:51.520 --> 01:56.720
and throw it against the wall, just to show we mean business.

01:56.720 --> 02:03.120
Ladine was at one time a consultant to the U.S. National Security Council.

02:03.120 --> 02:08.720
Norman Finkelstein, a key critic of Israel today, as they carry out a genocide in the

02:08.720 --> 02:13.960
Gaza Strip, was at the time of the book's publishing openly at odds with Mersheimer

02:13.960 --> 02:16.200
and Walt over this very issue.

02:16.200 --> 02:21.320
The argument that Steve Walt and I make in our book is that the Israel lobby, again,

02:21.320 --> 02:27.200
mainly the neo-conservatives, were the principal driving force in the United States behind

02:27.200 --> 02:28.200
the war in Iraq.

02:28.200 --> 02:34.840
Now, we argue that the lobby by itself, or the neo-conservatives by themselves, couldn't

02:34.840 --> 02:36.440
make the war happen.

02:36.440 --> 02:41.760
They definitely needed President Bush and Vice President Cheney to be on board.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.480
And that happened after September 11th.

02:44.480 --> 02:48.760
I do not think the evidence supports that claim.

02:48.760 --> 02:53.560
The chief architects of the war were Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Cheney.

02:53.560 --> 03:00.120
And I doubt anyone would claim that Mr. Cheney or Mr. Rumsfeld have any allegiances other

03:00.120 --> 03:02.680
than to the U.S. government.

03:02.680 --> 03:07.840
Not satisfied with merely debating, Mersheimer, Finkelstein devoted a chapter in his knowing

03:07.840 --> 03:14.280
too much to the Iraq question, where he gives a brief but helpful history of the neo-conservatives

03:15.280 --> 03:19.720
The founding fathers of neo-conservatism, such as Irving Kristol,

03:19.720 --> 03:22.360
He has been called the godfather of neo-conservatives,

03:22.360 --> 03:25.360
wrote the Marxist wave in the 1930s.

03:25.360 --> 03:33.160
Irving Kristol, Norman Potthoritz, Midge Dector, the magazines around which they coalesced,

03:33.160 --> 03:37.680
were basically partisan review and commentary.

03:37.680 --> 03:43.360
When this wave crested after World War II, they joined in the liberal anti-communist witch-hunt

03:43.360 --> 03:45.440
of the 1950s.

03:45.440 --> 03:50.400
The neo-conservatives then rode the new left wave in the early 1960s.

03:50.400 --> 03:57.000
When it crested in the mid-1960s, they again joined in the establishment backlash to it.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.560
As the spectrum of respectable opinion in the U.S. shifted steadily rightward, the Jewish

04:02.560 --> 04:08.200
neo-conservatives galloped yet more swiftly, eventually crossing the Rubicon from the Democratic

04:08.200 --> 04:11.240
Party to the Republican Party.

04:11.240 --> 04:16.880
As Finkelstein writes, the collapse of the Soviet Union shifted the focus of the neo-conservatives,

04:16.880 --> 04:21.240
and indeed U.S. defense policy makers generally, on the Middle East.

04:21.240 --> 04:27.960
However, he staunchly disagreed on a key argument put forth in the Israel lobby.

04:27.960 --> 04:34.000
The most sensational item on Mersheimer and Waltz' charge sheet alleges that the disastrous

04:34.000 --> 04:40.640
decision of the Bush administration to invade Iraq in 2003 was orchestrated by the Israel

04:40.640 --> 04:42.840
lobby.

04:42.840 --> 04:49.080
Finkelstein argues that if the principal architects of the war, namely George Bush, Dick Cheney,

04:49.080 --> 04:55.080
and Donald Rumsfeld, were motivated by Israel, why in the first and second-hand accounts

04:55.080 --> 05:00.360
of the pre-war behind-the-scenes debates of the Bush administration, Israel barely gets

05:00.360 --> 05:02.680
a passing mention.

05:02.680 --> 05:05.400
Finkelstein looks to their memoirs.

05:05.400 --> 05:10.600
In her memoir No Higher Honor, Condoleezza Rice, who was national security advisor in

05:10.600 --> 05:16.520
the Bush administration, does not list or even allude to Israeli security as the or

05:16.520 --> 05:20.080
even a motive behind the attack.

05:20.080 --> 05:25.240
In his memoir Known and Unknown, Donald Rumsfeld, who was secretary of defense in the Bush

05:25.240 --> 05:31.240
administration, also does not list or even allude to Israeli security as the or even

05:31.240 --> 05:34.080
a motive behind the attack.

05:34.080 --> 05:39.760
In his memoir In My Time, Dick Cheney, who was vice president in the Bush administration,

05:39.760 --> 05:45.360
also does not list or even allude to Israeli security as the or even a motive behind the

05:45.360 --> 05:47.800
attack.

05:47.800 --> 05:52.760
If the Israel lobby played such a critical role in the decision to attack Iraq, how

05:52.760 --> 05:56.600
was it able to so effectively cover its tracks?

05:56.600 --> 06:01.600
One could understand why Cheney et al might want to conceal that oil was the impetus behind

06:01.600 --> 06:07.040
the attack, but it is unclear what motive they would have to conceal the Israel lobby's

06:07.040 --> 06:08.040
role.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.560
It's a good question.

06:10.560 --> 06:15.240
If Israel played an important role in the decision to invade Iraq, one would think that

06:15.240 --> 06:20.000
this would be mentioned in the various memoirs of the perpetrators.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.760
In Mersheimer and Waltz book, they quote, knowledgeable and well-respected individuals

06:24.760 --> 06:29.760
who had said openly that the war was linked with Israel's security.

06:30.080 --> 06:36.280
Beginning with a Philip Zellico In September of 2002, Zellico was a member

06:36.280 --> 06:42.560
of the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, known to insiders as PIFIAB.

06:42.560 --> 06:47.080
He would also serve as executive director of the 9-11 Commission and as counselor to

06:47.080 --> 06:49.200
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.680
They've also written at least two books together.

06:52.680 --> 06:58.400
His words before an audience at the University of Virginia on September 10, 2002, were first

06:58.400 --> 07:03.120
reported by Imad McKay of the Interpress Service in 2004.

07:03.120 --> 07:09.680
While speaking on a panel of foreign policy experts, Zellico said the following statements.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.280
The unstated threat.

07:11.280 --> 07:15.520
And here I criticized the Bush administration a little because the argument that they make

07:15.520 --> 07:19.840
over and over again is that this is about a threat to the United States.

07:19.840 --> 07:24.200
And then everybody says, show me an imminent threat from Iraq to America.

07:24.200 --> 07:30.160
Show me, why would Iraq attack America or use nuclear weapons against us?

07:30.160 --> 07:33.080
So I'll tell you what I think the real threat is.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.360
It actually has been since 1990.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.680
It's the threat against Israel.

07:38.680 --> 07:43.360
And this is the threat that dare not speak its name because the Europeans don't care

07:43.360 --> 07:47.160
deeply about that threat, I will tell you frankly.

07:47.160 --> 07:52.320
And the American government doesn't want to lean too hard on it rhetorically because

07:52.360 --> 07:55.480
it's not a popular cell.

07:55.480 --> 07:58.280
Zellico names a familiar foe.

07:58.280 --> 08:04.280
If the danger is a biological weapon handed to Hamas, then what's the American alternative

08:04.280 --> 08:05.480
then?

08:05.480 --> 08:07.480
Play out those scenarios.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.200
Don't look at the ties between Iraq and al-Qaeda.

08:10.200 --> 08:15.840
But then ask yourself the question, G is Iraq tied to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic

08:15.840 --> 08:19.800
jihad and the people who carry out suicide bombings in Israel?

08:19.920 --> 08:24.520
Easy question to answer and the evidence is abundant.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.080
Zellico was right.

08:26.080 --> 08:31.320
In an October 2002 Human Rights Watch report on Palestinian suicide bombings during the

08:31.320 --> 08:36.840
Second Antifada, they note that Saddam Hussein's government provides funds to families of martyrs

08:36.840 --> 08:42.320
and others and has established a differential in which families of suicide bombing operatives

08:42.320 --> 08:48.080
are said to receive a considerably larger sum of $25,000 while other families that have

08:48.080 --> 08:51.800
suffered a death receive $10,000.

08:51.800 --> 08:56.600
Iraq provides these monies through the local Bath Party-affiliated Arab Liberation Front

08:56.600 --> 08:57.960
or ALF.

08:57.960 --> 09:03.560
The ALF is a constituent member of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.800
They cite an informative article from the Sydney Morning Herald.

09:06.800 --> 09:11.320
Its author, Paul McHugh, interviewed the Arab Liberation Front's Secretary General,

09:11.320 --> 09:16.920
Raqqat Saleh, who confirmed that since late 2000, more than 800 families have received

09:16.920 --> 09:19.640
martyr payments of $10,000.

09:19.640 --> 09:25.360
It's transferred by the banks, he said, from the Iraqi banks to the banks in Palestine.

09:25.360 --> 09:30.200
Philip Zellico was not happy with Mersheimer and Walt publishing his quote in the original

09:30.200 --> 09:32.480
article which later became the book.

09:32.480 --> 09:36.200
In the end notes of the subsequent book, Mersheimer and Walt write,

09:36.200 --> 09:41.600
We used these quotations in our original article in the London Review of Books and Zellico

09:41.600 --> 09:44.360
challenged our interpretation of them.

09:44.360 --> 09:49.360
We based our discussion on a full and unimpeachable record of his remarks and his challenge has

09:49.360 --> 09:51.280
no basis in fact.

09:51.280 --> 09:58.840
Ironically, Zellico appears to have been proving the point made in his original speech.

09:58.840 --> 10:03.600
As we saw earlier, Finkelstein's skepticism of Mersheimer-Walt's argument includes the

10:03.600 --> 10:08.240
fact that there is no mention of Israel as a motivation for invading Iraq in the memoirs

10:08.240 --> 10:11.960
of Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and others.

10:11.960 --> 10:16.720
But should that not itself elicit pause and skepticism?

10:16.720 --> 10:22.840
In his decision points, George W. Bush recalls a meeting with British Premier Tony Blair

10:22.840 --> 10:25.480
in April of 2002.

10:25.480 --> 10:30.320
In April 2002, Tony and Sherry visited Lor and me in Crawford.

10:30.320 --> 10:35.200
Tony and I talked about coercive diplomacy as a way to address the threat from Iraq.

10:35.200 --> 10:39.880
Tony suggested that we seek a UN Security Council resolution that presented Saddam with

10:39.880 --> 10:41.720
a clear ultimatum.

10:41.720 --> 10:46.040
Allow weapons inspectors back into Iraq or face serious consequences.

10:46.040 --> 10:51.760
As I recall that discussion, it was less to do with specifics about what we were going

10:51.760 --> 10:56.800
to do on Iraq or indeed the Middle East because the Israel issue was a big, big issue at

10:56.800 --> 10:57.800
the time.

10:57.800 --> 11:04.240
In fact, I think I remember actually there may have been conversations that we had even

11:04.240 --> 11:07.520
with Israelis, the two of us, whilst we were there.

11:07.520 --> 11:10.000
So that was a major part of all this.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.400
But the principal part of my conversation, we've got to deal with the various different

11:16.400 --> 11:18.560
dimensions of this whole issue.

11:18.560 --> 11:24.720
As we can clearly see, Blair provides details peculiarly absent from Bush's telling.

11:24.720 --> 11:29.160
Bush also railed against his critics in his memoir, saying some alleged that America's

11:29.160 --> 11:33.960
real intent was to control Iraq's oil or satisfy Israel.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.480
Those theories were false.

11:35.480 --> 11:39.880
I was sending our troops into combat to protect the American people.

11:39.920 --> 11:44.920
Saddam refused to cooperate with weapons inspectors, even with the threat of an invasion on his

11:44.920 --> 11:46.240
doorstep.

11:46.240 --> 11:50.720
The only logical conclusion was that he was hiding WMD.

11:50.720 --> 11:55.760
Despite an October 2003 Congressional Research Service report, which noted that from late

11:55.760 --> 12:03.680
November 2002 to March 2003, UN inspectors combed Iraq looking for weapons of mass destruction,

12:03.680 --> 12:08.960
conducting over 750 inspections at 550 sites.

12:08.960 --> 12:13.000
There's also the findings of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's report on Iraq

12:13.000 --> 12:16.320
WMD published in 2004.

12:16.320 --> 12:21.000
One of the committee's members, the late Dianne Feinstein, stated in no uncertain terms

12:21.000 --> 12:26.560
the state of Iraq's so-called nuclear program in the lead up to the invasion.

12:26.560 --> 12:31.120
I think it is clear that there was not an ongoing nuclear program.

12:31.120 --> 12:36.960
In August of 2002, prior to the vote in the Senate on the authorization to go to war,

12:36.960 --> 12:41.840
I spent a day in Vienna at the International Atomic Energy Agency.

12:41.840 --> 12:46.600
The IAEA is the agency that runs nuclear inspections.

12:46.600 --> 12:50.520
They saw no signs of a nuclear program in Iraq.

12:50.520 --> 12:56.600
The IAEA convinced me that there was no ongoing nuclear program in Iraq.

12:56.600 --> 13:01.640
The intelligence reporting on a possible Iraqi nuclear program did not have an impact on

13:01.640 --> 13:05.000
me because I did not believe it was correct.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.280
Though she still voted for the war oddly enough.

13:08.280 --> 13:13.480
The reason for the Bush administration's quietness about the role of Israel in the planning

13:13.480 --> 13:18.800
is evidenced by a revealing article in the Jewish Forward newspaper.

13:18.800 --> 13:23.080
The article is absent from both its English language and Yiddish language archives.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.680
It took some serious digging to find, actually, oddly enough, though Internet archive finally

13:26.680 --> 13:28.600
came through with the right maneuvering.

13:28.600 --> 13:33.360
It's called Iraqi Move Puts Israel in Lonely U.S. Corner.

13:33.360 --> 13:39.360
And it was written by Mark Perlman for the week of September 20, 2002 edition.

13:39.360 --> 13:44.560
In contrast to Bush's memoir alleging Saddam refused to cooperate with weapons inspectors

13:44.560 --> 13:50.440
with the only logical conclusion being Saddam possessed WMD, Saddam Hussein's surprise

13:50.440 --> 13:56.320
acceptance of unconditional United Nations weapons inspections put Israel in the hot seat

13:56.320 --> 14:02.560
this week, forcing it into the open as the only nation actively supporting the Bush administration's

14:02.560 --> 14:06.520
goal of Iraqi regime change.

14:06.520 --> 14:11.680
Israel's diffident stance appeared untenable this week after most capitals welcomed the

14:11.680 --> 14:17.760
Iraqi announcement Monday that it would accept the return of weapons inspectors without conditions.

14:17.760 --> 14:24.280
Further, Perlman writes, Israel and its supporters have insisted for weeks that while they sympathize

14:24.280 --> 14:29.440
with the administration's hardline stance toward Baghdad, they were reluctant to advocate

14:29.440 --> 14:31.760
any position openly.

14:31.760 --> 14:36.640
The reluctance was fueled by fears that critics would claim the United States was going to

14:36.640 --> 14:43.160
war on Israel's behalf, or even, as some have suggested, at Israel's behest.

14:43.160 --> 14:47.840
These concerns came a month after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told the Knesset Foreign Affairs

14:47.840 --> 14:52.960
and Defense Committee that Iraq is the greatest danger facing Israel.

14:52.960 --> 14:57.880
Though he clarified, we aren't intervening in U.S. decisions, but he said that strategic

14:57.880 --> 15:04.360
coordination between Israel and the U.S. has reached unprecedented dimensions.

15:04.360 --> 15:09.760
Days later, Aluf Ben reported for Haaretz, Israel is pressing the United States not to

15:09.760 --> 15:14.280
defer action aimed at toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.

15:14.280 --> 15:20.040
Quoting Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, the problem today is not if, but when.

15:20.040 --> 15:26.280
Adding that while attacking now would be quite dangerous, postponing it would be more dangerous.

15:26.280 --> 15:32.320
Aluf Ben continues, but like Sharon, Peres also added a disclaimer, saying he did not

15:32.320 --> 15:36.880
want to be seen as urging the United States to act and that America should act according

15:36.880 --> 15:38.600
to its own judgment.

15:38.600 --> 15:46.680
Israel, he said, will be a good soldier in the camp led by President George W. Bush.

15:46.680 --> 15:51.480
The appetite for war among Israeli officials was on open display.

15:51.480 --> 15:57.720
Foreign Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Benjamin Netanyahu wrote op-eds urging invasion.

15:57.720 --> 16:04.040
Barak wrote for The New York Times, an article titled Taking Apart Iraq's Nuclear Threat.

16:04.040 --> 16:08.320
Those who prefer to wait and hope for the best should contemplate the following.

16:08.320 --> 16:13.080
No one really knows how close Saddam Hussein is to building a crude nuclear device, and

16:13.080 --> 16:18.360
it was a crude device that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

16:18.360 --> 16:23.480
You will doubt Mr. Hussein's readiness to use a nuclear weapon against American assets

16:23.480 --> 16:28.800
or against Israel, if only under extreme circumstances.

16:28.800 --> 16:33.400
Once Iraq becomes a nuclear power, the very decision to go to war against it would become

16:33.400 --> 16:35.600
a totally different ball game.

16:35.600 --> 16:41.000
Notably, Barak felt comfortable enough to reveal his battle plan, which involved deploying

16:41.000 --> 16:44.840
some 300,000 American soldiers.

16:44.840 --> 16:50.000
For a successful invasion of Iraq, two operational options are basically valid.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.880
A surgical operation to hit the core of the regime, and a full-scale operation to include

16:54.880 --> 17:00.720
major airborne and ground forces, perhaps 300,000 soldiers.

17:00.720 --> 17:06.280
Saddam Hussein has set an example of defiance, especially against the first President Bush,

17:06.280 --> 17:12.080
that other Arab leaders cannot and should not emulate.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.720
Netanyahu wrote for The Wall Street Journal.

17:15.720 --> 17:21.400
Most Americans understand that, had Al Qaeda possessed an atomic device last September,

17:21.400 --> 17:25.000
the city of New York would not exist today.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.640
They realized that last week we could have grieved not for thousands of dead, but for

17:29.640 --> 17:31.520
millions.

17:31.520 --> 17:36.720
This is a dictator who is rapidly expanding his arsenal of biological and chemical weapons,

17:36.720 --> 17:41.600
who has used these weapons of mass destruction against his subjects and his neighbors, and

17:41.600 --> 17:45.040
who is feverishly trying to acquire nuclear weapons.

17:45.040 --> 17:50.040
We now know that had the democracies taken preemptive action to bring down Hitler's regime

17:50.040 --> 17:54.600
in the 1930s, the worst horrors in history could have been avoided.

17:54.600 --> 17:58.920
Today, nothing less than dismantling his regime will do.

17:58.920 --> 18:04.640
I write this as a citizen of the country that is most endangered by a preemptive strike.

18:04.640 --> 18:09.200
For in the last gasps of his dying regime, Saddam may well attempt to launch his remaining

18:09.240 --> 18:15.040
missiles with their biological and chemical warheads at the Jewish state.

18:15.040 --> 18:20.480
We support this American action even though we stand on the front lines, while others

18:20.480 --> 18:27.120
criticize it as they sit comfortably on the side lines.

18:27.120 --> 18:31.840
This hawkish rhetoric reportedly gave rise to concern among Israeli officials, writes

18:31.840 --> 18:34.560
Dan Eisenberg for the Jerusalem Post.

18:34.560 --> 18:39.640
In an article absent from its online archive, which I had to access via ProQuest, since

18:39.640 --> 18:45.600
it has not been archived in the Wayback Machine, the date was March 10, 2003.

18:45.600 --> 18:50.720
The US attack on Iraq will begin next week, but Channel 1 reported that the foreign ministries

18:50.720 --> 18:55.760
receiving reports from the US that the plethora of war predictions emanating from Israeli

18:55.760 --> 19:01.200
leaders is being sharply criticized by the US media, which accused them of trying to

19:01.280 --> 19:03.600
go the administration into war.

19:03.600 --> 19:08.400
Until now, however, Israeli officials have continuously ignored warnings from US and

19:08.400 --> 19:14.000
Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, to be cautious and stop predicting

19:14.000 --> 19:17.360
when the war will begin.

19:17.360 --> 19:21.760
Sharon himself appeared to heed the warning, and the man who previously claimed Saddam

19:21.760 --> 19:26.720
was the greatest threat to Israel, praised President Bush today for his pursuit of a

19:26.800 --> 19:32.640
possible war in Iraq while seeking to disavow any Israeli involvement, writes James Bennett

19:32.640 --> 19:34.480
for The New York Times.

19:34.480 --> 19:39.200
The finely calibrated statement reflected concerns at the top of the government that

19:39.200 --> 19:44.080
many of the worst critics in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere were identifying Israel

19:44.080 --> 19:45.680
as an instigator.

19:45.680 --> 19:50.720
Mr. Sharon sought to split Israel's support for a war from any responsibility for it.

19:50.720 --> 19:55.120
I wish to emphasize we are not involved in this war, Mr. Sharon said in a meeting of

19:55.120 --> 19:56.880
his party, Likud.

19:56.880 --> 20:02.960
Looking past an Iraq war, the Defense Minister, Shah Mufaz, has urged the United States to

20:02.960 --> 20:06.480
prepare to put diplomatic and economic pressures on Iran.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.160
More on that later.

20:09.200 --> 20:14.320
Indeed, not just Israeli officials were concerned, but also pro-Israel lobbyists in the United

20:14.320 --> 20:15.280
States.

20:15.280 --> 20:20.480
Dana Milbank, writing for The Washington Post, reported in November 2002 that a group of

20:20.560 --> 20:26.480
U.S. political consultants has sent pro-Israel leaders a memo urging them to keep quiet while

20:26.480 --> 20:29.440
the Bush administration pursues a possible war with Iraq.

20:30.080 --> 20:35.040
The six-page memo was sent by the Israel Project, a group funded by American Jewish

20:35.040 --> 20:37.040
organizations and individual donors.

20:37.680 --> 20:41.840
Let American politicians fight it out on the floor of Congress and in the media,

20:41.840 --> 20:42.800
the memo said.

20:42.800 --> 20:47.520
If your goal is regime change, you must be more careful with your language because of

20:47.520 --> 20:49.040
the potential backlash.

20:49.600 --> 20:54.240
You do not want Americans to believe that the war on Iraq is being waged to protect

20:54.240 --> 20:56.720
Israel rather than to protect America.

20:57.360 --> 21:03.120
And it was this pro-Israel lobby in the United States that sought to tone down language implicating

21:03.120 --> 21:07.440
itself in the war which it had persuaded the Bush administration to pursue.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.240
At least that's how Mersheimer and Walt would put it.

21:11.040 --> 21:17.040
The driving force behind the Iraq war was a small band of neo-conservatives who had long

21:17.040 --> 21:21.600
favored the energetic use of American power to reshape critical areas of the world.

21:22.160 --> 21:28.720
They had advocated toppling Saddam since the mid-1990s and believed this step would benefit

21:28.720 --> 21:31.120
the United States and Israel alike.

21:33.920 --> 21:39.360
It was the pro-Israel Thomas Friedman who told Haaretz's Ari Shavit in April 2003,

21:39.920 --> 21:44.640
I could give you the names of 25 people, all of whom are at this moment within a

21:44.640 --> 21:49.840
five-block radius of this office, they were in Washington DC at the time, who if you had

21:49.840 --> 21:55.440
exiled them to a desert island a year and a half ago, the Iraq war would not have happened.

21:57.360 --> 22:02.320
They were all affiliated with more than one think tank, comprising a network of like-minded

22:02.320 --> 22:06.960
fellows and scholars who would come to hold prominent positions in the Bush administration

22:06.960 --> 22:10.240
and have an influential role in American foreign policy.

22:10.560 --> 22:15.680
John Bolton, who would serve as the ambassador to the United Nations, could boast being a scholar

22:15.680 --> 22:20.640
for the Project for the New American Century, the American Enterprise Institute, and the

22:20.640 --> 22:26.240
Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, whose advisory board also included former CIA

22:26.240 --> 22:28.640
director James Woolsey and even Dick Cheney.

22:29.360 --> 22:35.360
What the late William R. Polk once described as an affinity bordering on patriotism to Israel

22:35.440 --> 22:40.800
among the neoconservatives is by no stretch of the imagination limited to Jews.

22:42.080 --> 22:47.760
In fact, Bolton is so pro-Israel that in May 2006, Israeli ambassador to the United Nations,

22:47.760 --> 22:53.200
Dan Gilerman, joked Bolton was a secret member of Israel's own team at the United Nations.

22:53.200 --> 22:58.640
The secret is out, we really are not just five diplomats, we are at least six, including John

22:58.640 --> 23:04.400
Bolton. After Bolton was to be reappointed in late 2006, which caused controversy among

23:04.400 --> 23:08.960
Democrats and Republicans alike, one of his defenders included Malcolm Holnelein,

23:08.960 --> 23:13.360
vice president of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.

23:13.360 --> 23:17.600
We talked about them in my last video. The Conference of Presidents comprises the 50

23:17.600 --> 23:22.880
largest organizations in the American-Israel lobby. The Jewish community remained supportive

23:22.880 --> 23:28.000
and would want to see Bolton stay, Holnelein said. Mark Perlman, writing for the Forward,

23:28.000 --> 23:33.920
explains, Bolton is viewed as a strong supporter of Israel and exercised the American veto last

23:33.920 --> 23:39.360
week on a UN Security Council resolution condemning the killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

23:39.360 --> 23:45.040
Bolton had cultivated especially close personal bonds over the years with all major Jewish groups.

23:46.160 --> 23:50.400
Just how much power did the neo-conservatives have in the Bush administration?

23:51.120 --> 23:56.320
Mersheimer and Walt explain, prominent officials in the Bush administration included Paul

23:56.320 --> 24:00.720
Wolfowitz and Douglas Spieth, the number two and three civilians in the Pentagon,

24:00.720 --> 24:06.560
Richard Perl, Kenneth Adelman and James Woolsey, members of the Influential Defense Policy Board,

24:06.560 --> 24:11.360
Scooter Libby, the Vice President's Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor,

24:11.360 --> 24:15.680
John Bolton, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security,

24:15.680 --> 24:20.880
and his special assistant, David Wormser, and Elliot Abrams, who is in charge of Middle East

24:20.880 --> 24:28.000
Policy at the National Security Council. Mr. Wolfowitz, considered a leader of the neo-conservatives,

24:28.000 --> 24:33.200
has an informative history prior to his being appointed as Deputy Secretary of Defense.

24:34.400 --> 24:39.040
Joseph Cerencioni wrote for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace just

24:39.040 --> 24:43.680
one day before the US would invade Iraq on 19 March 2003.

24:45.120 --> 24:49.760
Long before September 11, before the first inspections in Iraq had started,

24:49.760 --> 24:55.120
a small group of influential officials and experts in Washington were calling for regime change in

24:55.120 --> 25:02.480
Iraq. Some never wanted to end the 1991 war. Many are now administration officials. Their

25:02.480 --> 25:08.240
organization, dedication, and brilliance offer much to admire, even for those who disagree with

25:08.240 --> 25:15.600
the policies they advocate. Cerencioni's history begins as early as 1992. Paul Wolfowitz, then

25:15.600 --> 25:20.720
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, supervised the drafting of the Defense Policy Guidance

25:20.720 --> 25:26.000
document. A partially redacted version of the document is available in the National Security

25:26.000 --> 25:32.560
Archive. A section titled Middle East and Southwest Asia reads, As demonstrated by Iraq's invasion

25:32.560 --> 25:38.320
of Kuwait, it remains fundamentally important to prevent a hegemon or alignment of powers from

25:38.320 --> 25:44.720
dominating the region. We must endeavor to curb proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological

25:44.720 --> 25:50.640
weapons, as well as ballistic and cruise missiles. The infusion of new and improved conventional

25:50.640 --> 25:55.760
arms and the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction during the past

25:55.760 --> 26:01.280
decade have dramatically increased offensive capabilities and the risk of future wars throughout

26:01.280 --> 26:07.280
the region. Excerpts from the document were subsequently leaked to the New York Times,

26:07.280 --> 26:13.120
which caused something of a scandal. Embarrassed, the first Bush administration retracted it.

26:13.200 --> 26:18.480
Its drafting had been supervised by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Pentagon's Under Secretary for

26:18.480 --> 26:23.680
Policy, wrote Patrick Tyler, who goes on to explain the strong emphasis elsewhere in the

26:23.680 --> 26:29.680
document and in other Pentagon planning on using military force if necessary to prevent

26:29.680 --> 26:34.880
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in such countries as

26:34.880 --> 26:39.760
North Korea, Iraq, some of the successor republics to the Soviet Union, and in Europe.

26:40.720 --> 26:46.000
Though it was retracted, its supervisor of course became Deputy Secretary of Defense,

26:46.000 --> 26:53.120
and thus the Defense Policy Guidance document was rehashed as the National Security Strategy of 2002.

26:54.400 --> 26:59.840
Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass

26:59.840 --> 27:05.200
destruction. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the

27:05.200 --> 27:10.560
hands of the embittered few. We must defeat these threats to our nation, allies, and friends.

27:11.760 --> 27:18.000
The U.S. National Security Strategy will be based on a distinctly American internationalism

27:18.000 --> 27:23.280
that reflects the union of our values and our national interests. Our comprehensive strategy

27:23.280 --> 27:31.200
to combat WMD includes proactive counter-proliferation efforts. We must deter and defend against the

27:31.200 --> 27:40.240
threat before it is unleashed. There's also the year 1996, when Richard Perle, Douglas Feith,

27:40.240 --> 27:45.760
and David Wormser, all future Bush administration officials, wrote a report which they sent to

27:45.760 --> 27:50.800
the new Likud government in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu's first term as prime minister.

27:51.760 --> 27:57.840
The report called for a so-called clean break, and called removing Saddam Hussein from power in

27:57.840 --> 28:06.400
Iraq an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right. Jumping two years ahead in 1998,

28:06.400 --> 28:13.040
18 neoconservatives wrote a letter to President Clinton urging him to aim above all at the removal

28:13.040 --> 28:19.120
of Saddam Hussein's regime from power. That now needs to become the aim of American foreign policy.

28:20.800 --> 28:25.280
Again, many, most in this case, of the signatories became officials in the Bush

28:25.280 --> 28:31.280
administration, including Elliot Abrams, Richard Armataj, John Bolton, Paula Dobriansky, Richard

28:31.280 --> 28:38.720
Perle, Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul Wolfowitz. In January of 2001, as George W. Bush was to be

28:38.720 --> 28:44.960
sworn in as the 43rd president, the Jerusalem Post's Washington correspondent, Janine Zakaria,

28:44.960 --> 28:50.480
reported on the emerging group of officials who will steer U.S.-Israel relations during the next

28:50.480 --> 28:56.560
four years. She declared Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is quietly developing weapons of mass

28:56.560 --> 29:01.680
destruction. Regarding Paul Wolfowitz's appointment as number two at the Pentagon,

29:02.320 --> 29:09.040
pro-Israel communities are jumping for joy. Wolfowitz is considered a strong supporter of Israel.

29:09.680 --> 29:14.000
He has been one of the loudest proponents of a tough policy toward Iraq,

29:14.000 --> 29:19.520
focused on finding a way to bring down Saddam Hussein's regime. Jumping for joy indeed,

29:19.520 --> 29:24.880
in fact, for his role in the Iraq invasion, the Jerusalem Post would name Wolfowitz Man of the

29:24.880 --> 29:32.560
Year. No question, this was Paul Wolfowitz's year. On September 15, 2001, at a meeting in Camp

29:32.560 --> 29:38.880
David, he advised President George W. Bush to skip Kabul and train American guns on Baghdad.

29:39.520 --> 29:45.040
In the process, Wolfowitz became the most influential U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary ever.

29:45.040 --> 29:50.720
Can you so much as name anyone else who held the post? The war in Iraq had many authors,

29:50.720 --> 29:56.240
Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Tony Blair, George Bush. What's not in dispute is that

29:56.240 --> 30:02.400
Wolfowitz is the principal author of the Doctrine of Preemption, which framed the war in Iraq,

30:02.400 --> 30:07.600
and which, when it comes to it, will underpin U.S. action against other rogue states.

30:08.240 --> 30:14.080
Following September 11, many people grasped intuitively that it was useless to contain

30:14.080 --> 30:20.320
or deter foes for whom suicide was an acceptable option. The difference with Wolfowitz is that

30:20.320 --> 30:26.960
he's been talking about this since at least 1992. When President Bush says America will not permit

30:26.960 --> 30:31.600
the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons,

30:32.160 --> 30:41.120
that's Wolfowitz talking. The neoconservatives had infiltrated the White House. In April of 2002,

30:41.120 --> 30:44.800
a number of them would sign yet another letter, urging invasion,

30:44.800 --> 30:49.600
signed most prominently by now Defense Policy Advisory Committee Chairman Richard Pearl.

30:50.720 --> 30:55.520
Only the United States has the power and influence to provide meaningful assistance

30:55.520 --> 31:03.200
to our besieged ally. Mr. President, we urge you to accelerate plans for removing Saddam Hussein

31:03.200 --> 31:10.080
from power in Iraq. As you have said, every day that Saddam Hussein remains in power brings closer

31:10.080 --> 31:14.800
the day when terrorists will not just have airplanes with which to attack us, but chemical,

31:14.800 --> 31:21.920
biological, or nuclear weapons as well. It is now common knowledge that Saddam, along with Iran,

31:21.920 --> 31:28.560
is a funder and supporter of terrorism against Israel. Iraq has harbored terrorists such as Abu

31:28.560 --> 31:34.480
Nadal in the past, and it maintains links to the al-Qaeda network. If we do not move against

31:34.480 --> 31:41.040
Saddam Hussein and his regime, the damage our Israeli friends and we have suffered until now

31:41.040 --> 31:44.560
may someday appear but a prelude to much greater horrors.

31:46.400 --> 31:50.560
Now, I want to go back to Janine Zakaria's article for the Jerusalem Post,

31:50.560 --> 31:54.160
when she reported on the new appointees in the incoming Bush administration.

31:54.880 --> 31:59.120
There's one part that will surely stick out to some of you. It's about Bush's

31:59.120 --> 32:06.240
powerful Vice President Dick Cheney. Cheney is considered such a key player on foreign policy

32:06.240 --> 32:11.680
that people in Washington have started to refer to his staff as a shadow National Security Council.

32:12.320 --> 32:16.880
And while because of his business background, he is routinely referred to as an oil man by

32:16.880 --> 32:24.000
people in the pro-Israel community, a moniker which translate roughly as not sympathetic to Israel.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.840
I think you could make a case that on September 10th, 2001, it's not clear that George W. Bush was

32:30.400 --> 32:34.000
in any fundamental way going in our direction of foreign policy.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.920
That's Bill Kristol, co-founder of the Project for the New American Century,

32:37.920 --> 32:43.360
and son of Irving Kristol, mentioned earlier by Finkelstein as a founding father of neoconservatism.

32:43.360 --> 32:49.680
In fact, fellow neoconservative Jonah Goldberg described Kristol as the godfather of neoconservatism.

32:49.760 --> 32:55.200
Bill Kristol also signed the 1998 letter to President Clinton urging Saddam Hussein's removal

32:55.200 --> 32:59.280
and years later the 2002 letter urging Saddam Hussein's removal.

32:59.280 --> 33:03.520
Sorry, just so we're clear, he is one of the most prominent neoconservatives.

33:03.520 --> 33:10.080
I will work hard to find political solutions that allow and orderly and timely withdrawal

33:10.880 --> 33:17.840
from places like Kosovo and Bosnia. We will encourage our allies to take a broader role.

33:18.800 --> 33:25.920
We will not be hasty, but we will not be permanent peacekeepers dividing warring parties.

33:26.800 --> 33:31.120
And if you read Condi Rice's article in Foreign Affairs in 1999 to 2000,

33:31.840 --> 33:37.200
she was clearly the main adviser to Governor Bush. She was skeptical about a lot of these

33:37.760 --> 33:43.440
claims that the U.S. really had to shape a new world order that we had to engage in nation building.

33:43.440 --> 33:49.280
That article was Campaign 2000, Promoting the National Interest, published January 1st, 2000.

33:50.080 --> 33:55.200
From a section titled Coping with Rogue Regimes, Saddam Hussein's regime is isolated,

33:55.200 --> 34:00.000
his conventional military power has been severely weakened. The first line of defense should be

34:00.000 --> 34:06.320
a clear and classical statement of deterrence. If they do acquire WMD, their weapons will be

34:06.320 --> 34:10.880
unusable because any attempt to use them will bring national obliteration.

34:11.600 --> 34:16.640
We are able to keep arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt.

34:16.640 --> 34:21.280
The neoconservatives' role in persuading key Bush administration officials such as Cheney,

34:21.280 --> 34:26.160
Bush, and Condoleezza Rice to invade Iraq are all the more apparent by the fact that

34:26.160 --> 34:31.520
prior to September 11, there was no such commitment among them. Only nine days after

34:31.520 --> 34:36.560
the 9-11 attacks, The New York Times reported a split over the scope of retaliation.

34:37.440 --> 34:41.280
Some senior administration officials, led by Paul D. Wolfowitz,

34:41.280 --> 34:47.360
Deputy Secretary of Defense, and I. Lewis Libby, Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney,

34:47.360 --> 34:51.200
are pressing for the earliest and broadest military campaign against

34:51.200 --> 34:54.240
not only the Osama Bin Laden network in Afghanistan,

34:54.240 --> 34:59.440
but also against other suspected terrorist bases in Iraq and in Lebanon's Beqa region.

35:00.240 --> 35:05.280
These officials are seeking to include Iraq on the target list with the aim of toppling

35:05.280 --> 35:11.040
President Saddam Hussein, a step long advocated by conservatives who support Mr. Bush.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.400
A number of conservatives circulated a new letter today, calling on the president to make

35:16.400 --> 35:21.760
a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power, even if he cannot be linked to the

35:21.760 --> 35:27.600
terrorists who struck New York and Washington last week. On Sunday, Vice President Dick Cheney

35:27.600 --> 35:32.640
seemed to ally himself with Secretary Powell's view when he said in a televised interview that

35:32.640 --> 35:38.080
the administration did not have evidence linking Saddam Hussein to last week's attacks. But Mr.

35:38.080 --> 35:43.440
Wolfowitz, the Pentagon's influential deputy secretary, is a conservative thinker who has

35:43.440 --> 35:48.320
frequently clashed with Secretary Powell and the State Department. He has continued to press for a

35:48.320 --> 35:52.960
military campaign against Iraq that would not only punish Mr. Hussein for his past support for

35:52.960 --> 35:58.560
terrorism at home and abroad, but would also eliminate the danger he poses to Israel and the

35:58.560 --> 36:06.000
West in his quest to acquire weapons of mass destruction. What went into flipping Vice President

36:06.000 --> 36:12.240
Cheney now considered one of the chief architects of the war? Mersheimer and Walt looked to his chief

36:12.240 --> 36:18.240
of staff. A key part of the public relations campaign to win support for invading Iraq was the

36:18.240 --> 36:22.800
manipulation of intelligence information in order to make Saddam look like an imminent threat.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.720
Scooter Libby was an important player in this endeavor.

36:28.240 --> 36:32.640
One need only look at the Plame Affair to see the quality of this intelligence,

36:32.640 --> 36:36.320
the sludge which sloshed around Washington in the lead-up to the war.

36:38.400 --> 36:43.920
Much has been said about the Camp David meeting just days after 9-11, the story of Paul Wolfowitz

36:43.920 --> 36:48.240
and his obsession with Iraq, which perhaps planted the first seeds in convincing the

36:48.240 --> 36:54.240
administration to topple Saddam Hussein. But aside from Wolfowitz, another powerful figure

36:54.240 --> 37:00.320
was a critical mastermind that has escaped the same level of notoriety. His name is Irv Lewis

37:00.320 --> 37:05.600
Libby, known by his nickname Scooter. Max Frankel of the New York Times called him

37:05.600 --> 37:09.760
a poobah courtier who knew virtually all government secrets worth knowing.

37:11.040 --> 37:15.200
Bob Woodward explains his influence in his investigative account of the planning for

37:15.200 --> 37:20.080
the Iraq invasion. He was one of the most important players in the Bush National Security

37:20.080 --> 37:25.920
apparatus. Libby had three formal titles. He was Chief of Staff to Vice President Cheney,

37:25.920 --> 37:30.880
he was also National Security Advisor to the Vice President, and he was finally an assistant

37:30.880 --> 37:36.560
to President Bush. It was a trifecta of positions probably never held before by a single person.

37:37.760 --> 37:42.560
Just days after the American invasion of Iraq, Seymour Hirsch had written for The New Yorker,

37:43.120 --> 37:48.640
last September 24, the argument that Iraq had a nuclear program underway was buttressed by a new

37:48.640 --> 37:55.520
and striking fact. The CIA had recently received intelligence showing that between 1999 and 2001,

37:55.520 --> 38:01.360
Iraq had attempted to buy 500 tons of uranium oxide from Niger, one of the world's largest

38:01.360 --> 38:08.480
producers, known as Yellow Cake. Two weeks later, the resolution passed overwhelmingly,

38:08.560 --> 38:12.560
giving the President a congressional mandate for a military assault on Iraq.

38:13.600 --> 38:18.400
A former high-level intelligence official told me that the information on Niger was judged

38:18.400 --> 38:23.360
serious enough to include in the President's daily brief, known as the PDB,

38:23.360 --> 38:26.400
one of the most sensitive intelligence documents in the American system.

38:27.040 --> 38:32.640
On March 7, Mohamed Al Baradi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency

38:32.640 --> 38:38.400
in Vienna, told the UN Security Council that the documents involving the Niger-Iraq uranium sales

38:38.560 --> 38:45.840
were fakes. The problems were glaring. One letter, dated October 10, 2000, was signed with the name

38:45.840 --> 38:51.600
of Ellele Habibu, a Niger Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation who had been out of office

38:51.600 --> 39:00.480
since 1989. The attack was well underway by May 6, 2003, when Nicholas Kristoff wrote of the so-far

39:00.480 --> 39:06.320
missing WMD. There are indications that the US government souped up intelligence,

39:06.400 --> 39:12.320
leaned on spooks to change their conclusions, and concealed country information to deceive people

39:12.320 --> 39:18.400
at home and around the world. I'm told by a person involved in the Niger caper that more than a year

39:18.400 --> 39:23.680
ago, the Vice President's office asked for an investigation of the uranium deal. So a former

39:23.680 --> 39:29.920
US ambassador to Africa was dispatched to Niger. In February 2002, according to someone present

39:29.920 --> 39:34.640
at the meetings, that envoy reported to the CIA and State Department that the information was

39:34.640 --> 39:40.640
unequivocally wrong and that the document had been forged. This unnamed former US ambassador was a

39:40.640 --> 39:46.080
Joseph C. Wilson. He had been Ambo in Gabon and São Tomé, as well as head of African Affairs at

39:46.080 --> 39:50.880
Bill Clinton's National Security Council. As Max Frankel explains in The New York Times,

39:50.880 --> 39:56.800
Wilson's conclusions and other findings persuaded the CIA's director George Tenet to remove any

39:56.800 --> 40:02.720
mention of uranium sales from a presidential speech in October 2002, but the Niger scare

40:02.720 --> 40:08.000
resurfaced three months later, becoming a notorious 16 words. The British government

40:08.000 --> 40:13.600
has learned the Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.

40:15.120 --> 40:21.840
The war that ensued can't be described with mere words. It was, much like the current genocide

40:21.840 --> 40:28.560
in Gaza, a punishment campaign which, for grueling decade after decade, killed perhaps one million

40:28.560 --> 40:35.280
people. Not just from aerial bombardment, but, again, like Gaza now, a collapse of the healthcare

40:35.280 --> 40:42.400
industry, which gave rise to waves of mass death. And Iraq was only supposed to be the first step

40:42.400 --> 40:48.800
in a larger plan. A reshaping of the entire Middle East, and with outlets currently trying to tie

40:48.800 --> 40:55.680
the Hamas incursion into Gaza on October 7th to Iran, we very well may be seeing some seeds being

40:55.760 --> 41:02.800
planted. I think we should contemplate some kind of military reaction. I'm not suggesting World War

41:02.800 --> 41:09.200
III. I'm not suggesting sending 100,000 Marines, but there are plenty of Iranian targets. I hope

41:09.200 --> 41:15.440
I'm wrong. As I've said before, the Israel lobby is a series, and attention should be given to the

41:15.440 --> 41:21.360
ambitions of the Israel lobby on a nation of 90 million people just to Iraq's East. With the

41:21.360 --> 41:29.680
rising popularity of the neoconservatives yet again, perhaps Iran is more deserving of attention

41:29.680 --> 41:37.120
than ever. That's for the next one. The insiders who helped define the Bush doctrine are determined

41:37.120 --> 41:43.600
to set a course that will remake America's role in the world. They believe the removal of Saddam

41:43.600 --> 41:53.520
Hussein is the first and necessary act of that new era. And that fateful decision to take the

41:53.520 --> 42:05.600
nation to war now rests with the President of the United States.
