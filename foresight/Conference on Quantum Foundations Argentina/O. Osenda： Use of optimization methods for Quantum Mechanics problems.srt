00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
So good morning in this second day of the conference of Quantum Foundations.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,520
So we have today the pleasure of the first talk by Omar Asenda,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,240
who is from Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba in Argentina.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,360
He will speak about the use of optimization methods for quantum mechanics problems.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,080
So for one, please, Omar.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:32,240
Okay, thank you. Mariela, welcome. Congratulations to all the organizers for, well, finally,

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:45,440
that the 10th edition of this conference finally has, well, it's taking place.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:54,640
And thank you for the opportunity to address some colleagues in these times.

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:03,680
Actually, I usually prepare too much material for the talk.

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,600
So I have planned this talk in two parts.

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:16,320
I don't know how I will use exactly the time, but depending on how much time

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:26,080
how fast I can go, well, I will cover the transmission of quantum states and maybe

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,520
something about field body problems, but mainly the talk is about the transmission of

14
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:42,080
quantum states. Usually what this work is actually is not published yet.

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:50,240
You can find it in the archive, but it's an ongoing collaboration with Paulo Serra and

16
00:01:50,240 --> 00:02:01,200
Alessandro Ferron. And well, we can start thinking what is exactly a quantum state

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:11,280
transfer, what we can think a quantum channel is made of.

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:23,200
15 years ago, talking about a change of quantum systems, replicas of

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:32,640
a quantum system that are interacting between them and, well, that can be used as

20
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,960
a wire to transmit information. Well, 15 years ago, this was a major dream. It was the

21
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:51,280
realm of theoretical physics. Today, there are a lot of technical advances that made

22
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,800
the transmission of quantum state possible in solar state implementation, that is

23
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,920
the setting that many people think about. In quantum state implementations, for example,

24
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:19,920
the wire that will transmit the quantum state will be, for example, a chain of quantum dots or

25
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:31,600
a chain of superconducting qubits, etc. Ideally, the wire is used to

26
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,640
transmit quantum information from a sender to a receiver. The sender ideally will

27
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:50,080
prepare some quantum state, the information that they want to send. The channel

28
00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:03,120
should be initialized to a simple state, and the receiver will perform some

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:15,040
measurements to retrieve the information that the sender sent to him. Obviously, this is

30
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:25,200
a quite complicated problem if the Hamiltonian of the system is a many-bodied Hamiltonian,

31
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:38,720
and the interactions are, well, long-range, etc. Most people think, usually, in very simple systems,

32
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:47,920
in particular, many times the problem is not solved in the whole human space, so

33
00:04:48,080 --> 00:05:01,520
usually, the Hamiltonian has some symmetries that allow to restrict the dynamic of the problem

34
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:14,640
to use a sub-space of the whole human space. There are many protocols. A protocol is

35
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:30,080
a recipe to prepare the state, how the system evolves in time, and finally, how the information is

36
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:43,600
retrieved at the other stream of the chain. Many people is familiarized with the X-axis Hamiltonian,

37
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,760
that is a spin Hamiltonian that has only interaction, for example, in the plane,

38
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:02,880
is an isotropic Hamiltonian. To fix the idea, many people think that the initial state is prepared

39
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:11,440
in the first site of the channel. The rest of the chain is initialized in a simple state

40
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:22,000
that, depending on the physics of the problem, is maybe the ground state of the system.

41
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:34,640
The time evolution, obviously, is produced with some unitary time evolution operator,

42
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:45,920
because, at least in principle, the simplest way to analyze these problems is using unitary

43
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:55,520
time evolution. Obviously, it is possible to consider an open chain, an open quantum system,

44
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:06,720
but the problem becomes almost intractable. At least if the length of the chain

45
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:21,200
will be around the 10 spins or things like that. This is just to fix ideas. There are many forms,

46
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:30,240
many protocols, but this is the simplest. An initial state, and in the simplest protocol,

47
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,320
the time evolution is given by the autonomous Hamiltonian of the chain. There is no external

48
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:51,600
forcing, so, actually, the time evolution is the simplest time evolution operator,

49
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:01,520
is the exponential of the Hamiltonian. It is possible to use the spectral decomposition

50
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:14,320
of the operator. A lot of things are easy to calculate. Even more, if this is the initial

51
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,080
state and the Hamiltonian is for magnetic and the zero state is the random state,

52
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,400
this Hamiltonian commutes with the total magnetization, so the dynamics keeps,

53
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:41,120
is restricted to the one excitation subspace, so the dimension of the actual

54
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:53,440
hillar space is basically the size of the chain. If the chain has n spins, then the dimension of

55
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:01,360
the hillar space in the one excitation subspace, the dimension of the hillar space,

56
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:16,640
the subspace is just n. Many times, the quantity that is used to quantify how good, how successful

57
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:26,160
is the protocol, is called the fidelity, the transmission fidelity, that can be calculated

58
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:35,920
regularly using the amplitude probability that an excitation is

59
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,720
transferred from the first side of the chain to the last side of the chain. This quantity is

60
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,480
quite easy to calculate in the sense that it's just an expectation value of the

61
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:03,200
time evolution operator. This particular formula can be deduced because to

62
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:17,440
quantify the channel, usually what is used is an average over all the initial state that can be

63
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:29,440
prepared. Just to fix some ideas, many times, well, it is interesting to consider that the chain

64
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:45,280
could be in a disorder state. The couplings maybe cannot be fixed to some desired value.

65
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:55,840
Maybe there are defects in the fabrication process, or just like every

66
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:07,840
non-standard system, it is quite difficult to fix all the couplings, etc. And this

67
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:19,120
is, for example, how it is possible, for example, to control the time evolution of the problem.

68
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:27,360
Sometimes it is useful just to consider that the transmission process is forced or controlled

69
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:36,160
by applying some external control fractions. Why? Because many times, the natural time evolution,

70
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:46,000
the autonomous time evolution is not sufficient to achieve a good transmission. Obviously,

71
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,600
the idea is that if the fidelity reaches the unity, well, the transmission is perfect,

72
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:07,840
all values of FT superior to 0.999 are considered interesting, but obviously,

73
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:20,960
depending on the Hamiltonian, how these chain coupling coefficients are chosen, etc., this

74
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:31,760
fidelity could be a fiber that is lower rather lower than the unit. So, it is useful sometimes to

75
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:40,880
consider a forced evolution. But the problem of the forced evolution is obviously controlling

76
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:51,920
a nanoscopic, a microscopic quantum system is quite difficult. Many times, it is impossible

77
00:12:51,920 --> 00:13:01,120
to control the system with smooth functions. There are a lot of considerations that can be

78
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:11,120
made, advising against using a control evolution. Many times, it is the only option, because the

79
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:23,520
interactions cannot be chosen, but are fixed for some fundamental interaction. But the force

80
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:32,480
or the control evolution of a quantum system is quite difficult. In particular, if the system

81
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:47,040
doesn't have a lot of symmetries or the dynamics cannot be kept in a sub-space,

82
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,160
it is quite difficult to calculate this control evolution, because obviously,

83
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:06,480
the control functions shall be obtained using an optimization method. So,

84
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:17,360
anyway, for the excess Hamiltonian, people have been working in this area for many years.

85
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:24,080
So, there are a lot of interesting results, like perfect quantum state transmission is achievable,

86
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:36,400
choosing particular values for the quantities j, ji, or these quantities, choosing some very

87
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,840
particular values. It is possible to achieve using autonomous time evolution. It is possible to

88
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:52,880
achieve perfect quantum state transmission, basically for any initial state. Even more,

89
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:05,520
it can be proved that the dynamics behaves like a specular inversion in the quantum chain. So,

90
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:12,800
the thing that you prepare in the half of the chain will be reflected at some time in the other

91
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:21,280
half of the chain. It is very interesting. There are regimes where a most perfect quantum state

92
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:32,480
transmission can be achieved just using an almost homogeneous quantum state. All the coefficients,

93
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:43,040
all the strange coefficients are equal, except a pair or maybe four exchange coupling coefficients

94
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,880
will be chosen different, and a very good quantum state transmission can be achieved.

95
00:15:50,880 --> 00:16:03,920
So, why the XX Hamiltonian was studied so intensely? Why there are so many

96
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:14,640
results? Basically, because of this fundamental fact, it's quite easy to go in the XX Hamiltonian

97
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:28,880
from a given, I can choose the couplings and, well, I can calculate the, it is possible to

98
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:37,840
calculate the spectrum of the system, or it is possible to prescribe the spectrum that I want

99
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:46,080
to have for some Hamiltonian, and there is an unique way to calculate the exchange coupling

100
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:55,440
distribution. All the exchange coupling distribution is, in this case, always in the case where

101
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:06,400
we are dealing with the one excitation, some space, it's a one-to-one relationship, okay?

102
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,560
I can provide, for example, a very simple spectrum, for example, I can choose that the

103
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:24,880
spectrum of the system consists in eigenvalues that can be chosen, they are equal spaces between them,

104
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:33,200
okay? That sounds like a system that is quite possible that the whole contribution from the

105
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:43,040
eigenvalues cannot be constructed at some time, so I can choose this spectrum and the

106
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,520
coefficients can be calculated one by one in a unique way.

107
00:17:50,080 --> 00:18:01,920
Obviously, most quantum spinchase doesn't have this property, in particular, the

108
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:11,680
case in the Hamiltonian doesn't have this property. It is impossible to prescribe a spectrum,

109
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:21,280
and in that way, obtain the coefficients that produce that spectrum, okay?

110
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Well, as anybody that has found sometimes the better answer to the relationship between the

111
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:46,240
spectrum in the case in the Hamiltonian is, right, the obscure. Any way, well, or more precisely,

112
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:58,080
because of this, many words focus in the control transmission in the case in the Hamiltonian,

113
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,200
because, well, a lot of people thought that it was

114
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:19,760
easier to control a quantum chain, a homogeneous quantum chain obeying the case in the Hamiltonian,

115
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:29,200
and, well, controlling, designing very sophisticated control courses can be found that maybe the

116
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:38,240
transmission time, the transmission in the time in which the receiver can retrieve the

117
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:46,480
information sent by the sender, well, that time is around, obviously, if j is equal to 1,

118
00:19:47,040 --> 00:20:00,800
there are most no energy units, so it is natural to measure the transmission time in

119
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:12,080
units of the length of the chain. That is the only, okay, if j is exactly equal to 1,

120
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:25,200
this is a very good unit to measure the time. I didn't say it, but another interesting quantity

121
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:35,520
or another interesting feature of the change with the excess Hamiltonian is that here,

122
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:46,960
it is very easy to show that the transmission time, the transmission time that the receiver

123
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:56,240
should weigh to measure and obtain a very good fidelity of transmission, that time is bounded,

124
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,960
but by the time that is consistent with the quantum speed limit, so

125
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:17,680
it is very easy to think that this Hamiltonian has a sound velocity for the spin waves and that

126
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:27,920
spin and that velocity is related to the quantum speed limit. In the case in the Hamiltonian,

127
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:38,640
there is no simple way to assess which is the time scale with convenience to measure or to

128
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:55,840
try to produce a very good transmission. So, what can be done with all this? Well,

129
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:04,640
actually, we said that this quantity, the probability that an excitation can be transmitted

130
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:13,840
from the first side to the last side is a quantity that depends on the spectrum and on the sound

131
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:21,840
coefficients of the eigenvalue, sorry, of the eigenvector, so this quantity can be optimized.

132
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:34,320
I can think that this is a complicated function that depends, obviously, on all the coefficients

133
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:48,560
that determine the Hamiltonian, so maybe I can choose somehow the exchange couplings and

134
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:56,320
using that exchange coupling, I can calculate the spectrum, the eigenvalues and calculate this.

135
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,560
So, if I can devise a method to explore

136
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:19,200
all the large number of values of the z-coefficient, maybe I can find the largest value

137
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:33,360
for this quantity, for some time that I can choose somehow. So, it is obvious that

138
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,360
this function, the amplitude of probability that an excitation goes from the first side to the

139
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:51,440
last side is a quantity that depends on all the coefficients. In a general change, there will be

140
00:23:51,440 --> 00:24:04,480
nj coefficients, n exchange coefficients, so for a change, for example, of 50 spins,

141
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:19,840
it is a rather large space, a parameter space to explore. So, it is hopeless to try to

142
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:32,880
investigate the whole space in a completely random way, a space of 50 dimensions is to be to explore,

143
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:47,040
so maybe the exploration can be done using some kind of random walk, but it must be a

144
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:55,120
directed random walk in the parameter space. Well, fortunately, there are a lot of

145
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:05,520
methods, but the people in the statistical mechanics area have devised a lot of

146
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:18,080
methods to explore a rather large parameter space, and one of these methods is the

147
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:27,440
pivot methods that are used for global optimization. So, pivot methods are basically a good way to

148
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:38,320
generate a random walk that explores, in an intelligent way, a given parameter space. Obviously,

149
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:47,600
this is an example, an after-example of a search conducted over a two-dimensional parameter space.

150
00:25:48,320 --> 00:26:01,680
This is a typical chart flow that can be found in all the papers in pivot methods are paper from

151
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:16,240
the 90s, so instead of using some colorful cartoons, it is most common to find chart flows like this,

152
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:28,320
because chart flows are the way to express an algorithm. I don't want to enter, but I mean,

153
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:38,000
any pivot method, any method can be used that is useful to search in a large

154
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,960
parameter space, it can be used to perform exactly the same that we did. So, for example,

155
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:55,760
you have 10 more minutes, so to finish everything. Thank you, thank you. Well,

156
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:08,560
this is, for example, how can a search for the coefficient can be done. This is a short

157
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:20,960
chain, but it is useful because the chains that are used are termed centrosymmetric because

158
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:29,440
there are symmetry between the first exchange coefficient and the last, and the optimization

159
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:39,440
method proceeds, the pivot method proceeds like by looking in a particular hyper queue

160
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,520
that contains all the possible values of the exchange coefficients. The problem with the

161
00:27:45,520 --> 00:28:00,160
Heisenberg Hamiltonian has, there is not a simple way to bound the values of the

162
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:10,560
exchange coefficient that I need to use to achieve the transmission for some time, because, again,

163
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:20,000
the spectrum is quite complicated. We proceeded by looking at the best possible values of J that

164
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:29,360
provided a very good, or the best, the best fidelity of transmission in a small hyper queue,

165
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:40,320
but then we will, we proceed to enlarge the hyper queue and we go from some exchange

166
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:50,000
capital distributions that are obtained using some particular transmission time,

167
00:28:50,640 --> 00:29:00,880
and this is what we found after a lot of numerical effort, but, effectively, we found

168
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:12,320
very good, near-perfect quantum state transmission for spin chains of, basically,

169
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:20,560
the length that we wanted, and for the arrival times of our chosen.

170
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:32,400
So the pivot method is able to find the necessary exchange couplings to produce

171
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:39,680
very good or near-perfect quantum state transmission in the Heisenberg Hamiltonian.

172
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:52,480
That is a result that was not known previously, but obviously the way to look for this exchange

173
00:29:52,480 --> 00:30:04,240
coupling is clearly the result of a random walk that is performed, it's a direct random walk,

174
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:13,200
but maybe we can think that, well, the probability of transmission is quite high,

175
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:22,240
it's quite interesting, if you look at in this inset, all the transmission probabilities can be

176
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:32,960
made, well, basically, are bigger than 0.999 if we want to

177
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:46,400
that kind, that quality of transmission, but, obviously, once we get the exchange

178
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:57,440
coupling distribution, we wanted to understand if the solutions, this solution, have some physics

179
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:06,640
or are just results that the only thing that can be said about them is that they provide

180
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:18,720
a very good quantum state transmission. So we looked for the probability of having a good

181
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:28,640
transmission, this is a typical time evolution, near the transmission time, these are the peaks

182
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:41,200
of the probability for different settings, we can design or use different arrival times,

183
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:51,040
so, for example, these are very short arrival times, the black curves, the red curves correspond to a

184
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:58,560
larger arrival time, the blue one a more larger arrival time, but

185
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,120
each one of these was calculated with a different exchange coupling distribution, but, well,

186
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:21,840
some of us have a strong background in scaling and that kind of property, so we scale the time

187
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:29,120
evolution of the probability and we found that, basically, it doesn't matter what is the time,

188
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,120
the arrival time, basically, the behavior around the arrival time is basically the same,

189
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:48,800
which is a quite neat result because the exchange coefficients that are used to

190
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:58,960
calculate the probability of arrival probability for a given time has nothing to do with

191
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:09,280
the another exchange coupling distribution, so, for example, it is possible to,

192
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:23,520
after some numerical experiments are done, it is possible to study what is the minimum size of

193
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:32,560
their per queue necessary to find where this exchange coupling can be found, this is that size,

194
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:43,440
for example, we can say that if we choose a larger arrival times, the strength of the

195
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,640
exchange coupling distribution, the maximum value of the exchange coupling distribution,

196
00:33:50,720 --> 00:34:00,400
basically, decays in an exponential way, so, in a sense, we can say that for very large exchange,

197
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:12,240
sorry, for very large arrival time, basically, the chain will be, well, basically almost

198
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,480
homogeneous, but not exactly homogeneous, there is no need to have very different values

199
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:36,320
between the exchange coupling distribution, and, well, another way to qualify how good

200
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:44,080
are these exchange coupling distributions, for example, consider what the set of exchange

201
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:54,880
couplings have been obtained, well, what about adding some disorder if, well, looking at this

202
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:05,600
fiber is quite obvious that the probability, the transmission, the transfer,

203
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:17,520
the probability that is related to fidelity can be made as large as close to the unity as wanted,

204
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:34,080
but these values are stable if some disorder is produced, everything, maybe this transmission

205
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:43,440
under some disorder is completely destroyed or not, well, we consider some static disorder

206
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:53,520
applied to the chain, and we found that, well, the chain was able to sustain some disorder, so,

207
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:06,480
the, in some sense, the maximum found by the pyramid is rated well, because applying some disorder

208
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:18,880
can be thought like, well, making another stochastic search, another stochastic search around the

209
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:30,480
values that the people met found, but basically, we can say that the spin distribution are, well,

210
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:40,080
produced a very good, very, very good transmission, and that they are quite stable against

211
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:51,040
this disorder, so, as I said, I prepare a lot of material, but the conclusion of this part is,

212
00:36:51,040 --> 00:37:06,240
we are almost in time, yeah, yeah, the conclusion, well, this, the physics near this new configuration,

213
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:15,920
this new change, is quite inspired, we want to study the physics, how the transmission is produced

214
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:27,440
in this change that has, that have the couplings, Tyler is specifically to produce a large,

215
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:44,320
a large fidelity of transmission, well, as a stochastic search, everything works fine, but we

216
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:52,960
don't know why, at least, well, in that moment, when we wrote the manuscript, we didn't have

217
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:02,400
clues why everything works so fine, I think that we now have some clues that we are exploring them,

218
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:12,240
this procedure will be successfully translated to another Hamiltonian, we are looking for that,

219
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:27,200
maybe there are other procedures to determine these couplings in another way, maybe there are,

220
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:37,200
because looking at the exchange couplings that are calculated, it is not obvious that they can be

221
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:48,400
translated in a, in a, in a simple formula, we are discussing also if some experimental implementation

222
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:56,240
can be made, well, and that's it, well, half a minute, okay, one minute and a half,

223
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,840
thank you very much, thank you Omar, so if someone has a, just a short question,

224
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,080
we can put it here,

225
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:31,120
so you mean the, the, of elements in mind, you studied the, the left, the chain,

226
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,720
and you did a search, sorry, you touched with the left, the chain, dependent on n?

227
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:48,640
Sorry, the communication was interrupted, but I couldn't hear the question, can you repeat, sorry,

228
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,120
if you did a search with the left, length of the chain, depending on the number n,

229
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:02,160
just to short something, but you mean small, the size of the system, you're,

230
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:19,600
no, we, we can study the chains from, from 10, 10 spins, 10 spins to 100, there is not an actual

231
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:33,680
limit, we stopped in 100 because, well, we didn't want to, to, to wait for the, for the results,

232
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:47,920
but there is not a practical limit, anyway, a chain of 100 sites is beyond, clearly it's beyond

233
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:57,920
any practical implementation at least for, for a few next years, but there is no an upper bound,

234
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,960
we stopped around 100, but we, for some new experiments, for some new results, we're

235
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:14,480
maybe looking at 120, yeah. Thank you. So we don't have, we don't have any comments,

236
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:23,680
so we thank again Nomar with a, with a clap, so we can change the vertical, thank you.

237
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:32,800
Thank you organizers, I want to thank you again, congratulations to achieve the 10th

238
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,440
conference and, and, and well, for a, for a very good acronym.
