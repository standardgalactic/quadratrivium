1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Thanks, and now we move on to the next speaker of this morning's session with Alison Desin.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,080
Please, Alison, if you can start sharing your screen.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,280
Can you hear me?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,040
Yes, perfectly. And also, perhaps it's better if you put a full screen mode.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:36,560
Okay. Okay, so the next speaker is Alison Desin from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil,

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,960
and he's talking about are we witnessing non-local phenomena when non-contextuality inequalities

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:53,360
are violated? Please, Alison, go on. Okay, so I'd like to thank the organizers for having

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:01,040
attended my talk, and congratulations for this very nice conference, and it's a pleasure to be here.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:09,120
And so, as you see, this talk is about a question, and the question is if we are witnessing

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,800
non-classical phenomena when non-contextuality inequalities are violated? And I would like

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,120
to begin this presentation by just finding this question. And in order to do that, I will show

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,360
a couple of examples of very recent papers where this claim is made. So the claim that

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,160
contextuality, which means by which I mean the violation of a non-contextuality inequality,

15
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:42,880
is some kind of signature of non-classicality. So these are the examples. So contextuality is a

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,600
non-classical behavior that can be exhibited by quantum systems. It's a non-classical feature

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,840
challenging everyday intuition. It's a non-classical property exhibited by quantum statistics.

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,640
It's a key signature of non-classicality. And finally, it's their catapult on classical

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,560
feature of quantum phenomenology. So we know that this is a common view. And in order to contrast

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,640
contextuality and classicality, let me explain what I mean by classicality. And I will do that

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:26,720
basically by quoting this paper. And the main point is that as I see it, a criterion for classicality

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,160
must have a phenomenological meaning. So as they say in this paper, a criterion of classicality

23
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,920
must allow us to say that in some sense, nature fails to respect classical physics.

24
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,280
So non-classical phenomena must defy classical understanding. And this is basically what I

25
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,800
expect from a criterion of classicality. So we can now rephrase our initial question,

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,400
just to be more explicitly. And we are asking if nature fails to respect classical physics when

27
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:12,080
non-contextuality and equivalence are violated. Okay, so now let's discuss non-contextuality and

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,120
equivalence. And this definition of contextuality that is the violation of non-contextuality and

29
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,280
equivalence, it's a very operational definition in the sense that it's a definition we apply for

30
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:40,880
experimental data. So contextuality. Wait, wait, there's something I will try to move Federico.

31
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,480
Everyone please move their phones. Sorry, Allison, please go on. Okay.

32
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:56,880
Okay, so as I said, this is an operational definition, the sense that it's a label we

33
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:04,400
apply for experimental data. And this idea of contextuality as something that we can apply

34
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:12,800
for data with no reference to the underlying structure of the mechanism we are working with,

35
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,120
it's a definition that arises in the context of this model independent approach to physics.

36
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:27,040
So I will discuss this model independent approach very briefly because I think some

37
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,800
of you may not be familiar with it. And the core idea behind model independent approach to physics

38
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,480
is this idea of a black box. And a black box is a measurement setup. And we say we call it a

39
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,280
black box because we assume that we can ignore the underlying structure of this setup and we can

40
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,440
look onto the data. So as Popesco says, according to this view, the entire physics should be

41
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,400
encapsulated in the data. And we can discuss, for example, locality from this perspective. So

42
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,880
we can discuss locality beyond quantum mechanics. So with no reference to quantum systems. So all

43
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,480
we need are devices and measurements that are outputs. And we can also discuss contextuality

44
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,080
in this perspective. And this is exactly the definition of contextuality that is based on

45
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,640
non-contextuality in equities. So contextuality is the violation of non-contextuality in equities,

46
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,840
just as non-locality is the violation of the inequalities. Or we can equivalently say that

47
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:43,760
contextuality corresponds to the existence of global sections. So this is equivalent to say

48
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:55,200
that contextuality is the violation of non-contextuality in equities. And just to make it clear that

49
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,400
this idea of black box appears in contextuality analysis, I will show two examples. So here they

50
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,840
say that we have a black box and that the agent consumes the box by simultaneously performing

51
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,880
a subset of measurements. And a subset of measurements that we can simultaneously perform is what we

52
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:21,360
call a context. And here they say the same. So we have a black box that is a device containing

53
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,280
buttons and lights. And buttons represent measurements and lights represent outcomes

54
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,800
or outputs. And we have contexts that are collections of buttons that we can press jointly.

55
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,520
And okay, so these are some pictures representing this idea of black box in contextuality analysis.

56
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,720
So here we see that we have a black box with inputs that are buttons or measurements and

57
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:53,360
outputs that are represented as lights. So okay, so this is basically this this model

58
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:02,000
independent view. And now we will show a particular example of black box. And we will discuss this

59
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,440
example using the compatibility hypergraph approach to contextuality. That is one of many

60
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,520
model independent approach to contextuality analysis. And we have to introduce a measurement

61
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,680
scenario in order to define a black box. And the measurement scenario we consider is a very

62
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,120
standard example of a measurement scenario in contextuality analysis.

63
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,200
That is the device cycle. So in this scenario, we have only five measurements. And all measurements

64
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,200
of this scenario are binary. So they have only two possible outcomes. So one and zero. And this is

65
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:46,880
the symbol we call one. And this is the symbol we call zero. Okay, and we also have to define

66
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,760
a context. So we call that a context represents a collection of measurements that can be measured

67
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:00,080
simultaneously. And these are the contexts we consider in the five cycle. So a context in

68
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,880
this scenario is a pair of consecutive measurements. So for example, a one, a two is a context,

69
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,520
a three, a four is a context, a four, a zero is not a context, and so on. So we have five contexts.

70
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:21,040
And as I said, this is a very standard example of measurement scenario for contextuality analysis.

71
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,680
So these measurements are like the buttons of our black box. And now we have to introduce

72
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:35,120
a behavior for this scenario. That is the data our black box generates. And the behavior we consider

73
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:42,960
is a very famous example of contextual behavior in the five cycle. And the behavior and it's

74
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:50,160
this behavior. So by definition in contextual analysis, the behavior of a scenario is context

75
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,960
dependent. So we associate a probability distribution for each context. And this is the

76
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:02,080
distribution we associate for a context in the five cycle. So, so if we measure together AI and AI

77
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,840
plus one, we will never obtain the same outcome. And the probability of obtaining zero one or one

78
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,200
zero is the same. And this is this is the data our black box generates. So this is the behavior of

79
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,880
our box of our box. And okay, and what we can say about this behavior. So first of all, it's not

80
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:30,160
disturbing, which means that according to this behavior, it means that a measurement has the

81
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,560
same distribution across all contexts. And moreover, according to this behavior, a measurement

82
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,480
behaves like a coin toss. And this is one of the reasons why we are calling this behavior a

83
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:50,560
generalized coin toss. This behavior is an example of stronger than quantum correlation,

84
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,920
which means that quantum theory cannot predict this behavior. And finally, this behavior is

85
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,000
contextual. So it violates a non contextuality inequality or equivalently, we cannot define

86
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,600
a global section for this behavior. So it means that we cannot define a probability distribution,

87
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,760
including all measurements of this scenario that is capable of predicting this behavior. So, and

88
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,040
this is an example of a maximum contextual behavior in the five cycle. And this is why this

89
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,720
example is very famous. Okay. And in the in the compatibility

90
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,800
hydrograph approach, contextuality and nonclassicality are equivalence definitions. So according to

91
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,880
this approach, if our black box generates this this data, then then we have to say that our

92
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:51,600
black box generates non classical correlations. Okay. So thus far, we have discussed contextuality

93
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,440
from this model independent view. And we have showed a very famous example of contextual behavior

94
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,720
in the five cycle. So this is the data our box generate. And this is the data we are going to

95
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:14,480
analyze. Okay, but now I will let's let's look inside the the box. And your and to begin with,

96
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,920
I would like to compare on the balance with contextuality and equities because

97
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,280
as I said, contextuality, according to this definition is the violation of non contextuality

98
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,360
and equities, just as no locality is the violation of very equities from this model

99
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,760
independent perspective. So let's compare these two definitions. So suppose we have

100
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,960
a bell scenario. So it's a scenario containing two space like separated parts. So each part has

101
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,000
a black box, and each part is performing measurements, and they are generating data

102
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,320
together. And we analyze this data. And if it is data violate a bell inequality,

103
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,600
we can say that we are witnessing a non local phenomenon, which means that

104
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,960
and locality or non locality is a physical concept in the sense that we can define it

105
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,560
in terms of physical principles. For example, we can define locality using using special

106
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:21,120
relativity. And in this case, so in this case, the data we have is is intrinsically associated

107
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,320
with a physical phenomenon. And we can really ignore the underlying structure of these boxes.

108
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,400
So this this measurements, they can be, for example, questions, yes, no questions we ask for

109
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:39,280
these agents. And these outputs can be answers they give. And if it in this case, if this

110
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,560
if these bell inequalities are violated, we can say that we are we are witnessing

111
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,680
no local phenomenon. So there is this physical phenomenon associated to the data we have.

112
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:58,160
But in contextual analysis, we have no physical phenomenon associated to it, because

113
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,720
contextuality according to this model independence definition is not a physical phenomenon,

114
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,560
because we cannot define it in terms of physical principles. So it would not be a surprise if

115
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,240
inside a box generating non classical correlations are contextual correlations,

116
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:24,880
we had a a a simple classical structure. And, and I will try to show now that

117
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,200
this is the case for the behavior we we we called a generalized coin toss.

118
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:38,960
Okay, and before we go through the example, I would like to say three things about it.

119
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:45,280
So first of all, recall that we are assuming here that everything is encapsulated in the data.

120
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,880
So we can, in some sense, ignore the ignore the underlying structure of this black box.

121
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,720
So a black box is a very permissive concept. So it may contain an entire laboratory containing

122
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:06,880
particles and measuring devices. And also the the the mechanism we propose is basically a

123
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:15,040
toy mechanism for coin tossing. And coin tossing is is according to many operational

124
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,360
approach to physics, it's a valid example of measurement procedure. So for example,

125
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,360
people who work with packing context reality and

126
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,920
generalize the probability theories, they are all the time using coin tossing as an example of

127
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,960
measuring procedure that is valid. So that's why we say that this mechanism works along the line

128
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,360
set out in many operational approach. So according to these approach, if we had inside a black box

129
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:51,920
a coin coin flip a coin tossing, it would be a valid measurement procedure. And more importantly,

130
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,440
this this mechanism is something like a thought experiment. So we are trying to show that unlike

131
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,240
no local data, no contextual data can be generated by a simple classical mechanism.

132
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,680
So this mechanism should be understood as a thought experiment. So it's not a mechanism

133
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:17,200
that is interesting by itself. So okay, now let's go through the the mechanism. And as I said,

134
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,600
it's it's basically a toy mechanism for coin tossing. And how can we describe

135
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:32,240
a coin toss using toy mechanism. So we need an object. So in the in the real world, we we use

136
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,120
a coin that is an object has that for all practical purposes has two sides. So here in this time

137
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,760
mechanism, we consider for the sake of simplicity, a 2D object, and each has two sides. So one side

138
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:55,520
is dark gray, the other side is light gray. And we have we need to flip this object. So we fix an

139
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,200
axis passing through the center of this object, and we flip this object. And at the end of the

140
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,920
movement, we look to the side that is showing when the coin lands. So this is the real case.

141
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,960
So in this toy mechanism, we we we fix this side of the object. So and we imagine that this is a

142
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:22,320
sensor and the sensor can detect color that in this case is gray. And it can distinguish dark

143
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:29,360
from light color. So we have these two outputs. So these outputs are like hazard tails. So they

144
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,160
they are dark gray or light gray. And the behavior we obtain if we perform these measurements,

145
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,360
these measurements. So if we flip this coin is the behavior of a fair conflict, because this

146
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,400
mechanism is is constructed for for this purpose. So okay, so this is a toy mechanism for coin toss.

147
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:57,120
And the point is that we can propose a straightforward generalization of this mechanism

148
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,600
that is capable of generating the the behavior we call a generalized coin toss that, as I said,

149
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,280
is a very famous example of contextual correlation, contextuality analysis.

150
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:19,600
So a coin toss, we have one binary measurement. So we need an object having one pair of positive

151
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,640
sides. But in the generalized coin toss, we have five pairs of positives. So we have five binary

152
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,720
measurements. So we need an object having five pairs of positive sides. So it could be something

153
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:42,560
like an unsided dice or something like this. And but we are proposing just a toy mechanism. So we

154
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,800
consider a 2D object. And this is a regular decadent. And for each pair of positive sides,

155
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,920
we associate a measurement. And for for its measurement, we associate a color. And okay,

156
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:04,800
and the measurement procedure inside of this box is a coin flipping. But the the the flipping is

157
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:12,240
determined in this case by the context. So the context in this toy mechanism is an axis passing

158
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,480
through the center of the object. And together with a sensor and the sensor can detect color and

159
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,400
it can distinguish that from each color. So for example, if we want to measure a two and a three

160
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,840
together, if we press these buttons in our box, this mechanism will just flip this coin. But with

161
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,520
respect to the axis that they're mined by this context, so this is the axis, this vertical line.

162
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,760
And if we do that, we can obtain two possible outcomes. So we can detect dark yellow and

163
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,600
light green, or we can detect light yellow and dark green. So we can never detect, for example,

164
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,920
dark yellow and dark green because they are in a positive side of this object. So

165
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,080
this is a mere geometrical restriction of the object. And this is why we have this,

166
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,800
we have the correlation that is predicted by the generalized coin toss in this context.

167
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,160
And this is the mechanism we have. So each context is an axis together with a sensor. And

168
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:20,480
whatever is the context we consider, we have only these two possible outcomes and the behavior is

169
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:28,240
the behavior we call a generalized coin toss. Okay. And we also must be able to measure single,

170
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,400
to perform single measurements. And in order to do that, we have to fix a context.

171
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,320
So this is the general case in contextual analysis. So for example, if we want to measure

172
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,360
these measurements, A0, that is red, we have two options. So we have two contexts containing A0,

173
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,760
and we have to choose one of them. So we can choose, for example, this context,

174
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,320
and we just flip this object. And so we have two possible outcomes, so dark red or light red,

175
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:04,080
and the behavior is the behavior of a fair coin slip. So to sum up, this mechanism, this time

176
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,560
mechanism, or just thought experiment, generates the behavior we call a generalized coin toss.

177
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:19,440
And okay, and what we can say based on this example, based on this thought experiment.

178
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,200
So first of all, let's discuss contextuality beyond content theory.

179
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,880
Okay, so the first point is that without clear specification of what measurement means,

180
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,840
contextuality has no phenomenological significance. It means that the meaning of

181
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,480
contextuality or the phenomenological meaning depends on what we mean by a measurement.

182
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,080
So in contextual analysis, the underlying structure matters. So we cannot say that,

183
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,360
I think that based on this thought experiment, I think this thought experiment suggests that we

184
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:02,240
cannot ignore the underlying structure in order, when we are analyzing data from this

185
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:10,320
perspective of contextuality. Which means that in contextuality analysis, the entire physics

186
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:18,800
does not seem to be encapsulated in the data. So what we mean by measurement is important.

187
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,480
And finally, contextuality, at least beyond content theory, does not require a non-classical

188
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:34,320
phenomenon. Okay, and can we say something about contextuality in content theory,

189
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,840
based on this thought experiment? And I think we can. So note that in our thought experiment,

190
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:50,160
we are working with a classical object. So it's basically a coin. So

191
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,400
it's a classical object in the sense that it's a rigid body. So it's just a thought mechanism.

192
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:07,440
So we say it's a 2D object, but we can imagine it as a real body, just as we imagine a coin as

193
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,240
a rigid body. And okay, so we have this classical object and measurements, our measurement procedures

194
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,160
are not revealing perverts processed by the system. And also we have context. So not all

195
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,760
measurements can be simultaneously performed. So we have this restriction that is an

196
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,760
instrumental restriction. So this is part of our mechanism. So it means that in our

197
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,920
experiment, we are working with measurements that I like to co-example, that are measurements

198
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,760
that are not revealing perverts processed by a system.

199
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:52,640
And we know that this view on measurement is a very common view on content measurements,

200
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,640
because we have Cauchy's Becker theorem. And Cauchy's Becker theorem says that

201
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,840
self-adjoint operators cannot be thought of as representing perverts simultaneously

202
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:09,360
processed by a system. So Cauchy's Becker theorem suggests some kind of substantive

203
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,160
view on measurements. So we have to accept that measurements are not revealing perverts

204
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,000
processed by a system, or at least that they are not revealing perverts that are

205
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,880
simultaneously processed by the system. But the point is that if the measurements we have

206
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,160
are epistemic, so if the measurements we have are not revealing perverts of a system,

207
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:39,360
then we have contextuality in the data. So the data our system generates will violate

208
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,600
non-contextuality and equivalence. And it's not because the system is non-classical or it's classical,

209
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,280
it's because measurements are epistemic. And the reasons that epistemic measurements cannot be

210
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,960
defined as random variables share in the same sample space. So we cannot define the

211
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,840
measurements because the measurements that are like coin flippings in our thought experiment,

212
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,040
we cannot represent those measurements as random variables in the same sample space.

213
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:17,680
And that's why we have contextuality in content systems, I think. And we must recall that

214
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:25,120
KS theorem, Cauchy-Specker theorem is about realism, it's not about classicality. So to sum up,

215
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:33,440
in quantum mechanics, we have, so in general, actually, if we have epistemic measurements,

216
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,360
or if we have measurements that are not revealing perverts processed by a system,

217
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,800
and if we have context, so if we have these restrictions on what we can measure jointly,

218
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,200
then we have contextual data. So we have no ground for expecting non-contextuality in the data,

219
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,200
because our measurements are not random variables in the same sample space. So

220
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,320
I think that this thought experiment suggests that those who accept the epistemic view on

221
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,320
measurements, that is the view suggested, for example, by the orthodox interpretation of this,

222
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,440
this is the view hold by bar, and this is a very widespread view on quantum measurements

223
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,360
in quantum mechanics. So those who accepted this view, I think that should not take for granted

224
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,360
that nature fails to respect classical physics when quantum systems violate non-contextuality

225
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,760
in the file. So it seems that these violations are actually our consequence of the type of

226
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,400
measurements we are considering. And if we accept that the measurements we have in quantum

227
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,480
systems are epistemic measurements, then we should be, we should not say that

228
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,440
nature fails to respect classical physics when these violations occur. And that's it,

229
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,640
that's what I had to say today. And thank you.

230
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:06,640
Thanks, Alison. Thanks for this talk. So we have some time for one short question,

231
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:14,640
because now we are on 9.56. So if someone has a question, please go on.

232
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:27,600
So I have a question or perhaps an observation, which is you can see the violation of

233
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:36,160
Bell inequalities as a particular case of a non-contextuality inequality, right? Because

234
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:47,600
and when you speak about model independence, it is not so independent of physical laws,

235
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,800
because in model independence, you have space-time structure. This is not the stress,

236
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:04,880
usually in the literature about it, but otherwise, if you don't consider the space-time structure,

237
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,360
you cannot speak about a model independence analysis of an analysis above scenario.

238
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,800
You cannot even speak about space-like separation between measurements, you know?

239
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:27,120
And so what I think regarding your talk is that perhaps this space-time causal structure

240
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:36,960
should be taken into account into your analysis. I agree in that if you don't take space-like

241
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,040
separation, you can reproduce everything with a classical mechanism. And I think that that is

242
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:49,680
accepted, right? I mean, because you have examples of contextuality in, for example,

243
00:27:49,680 --> 00:28:04,160
in mathematical psychology and so on. I agree. But even so, I think that you can include

244
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:10,480
the violation of Bell inequalities as a particular example of a violation of a non-contextuality

245
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:17,760
inequality. So what do you think about that? That cannot be reproduced by any classical

246
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:25,120
mechanism. What do you think about that? Yes, I agree. So that's why I contrast, I compare

247
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,200
Bell inequalities with non-contextuality inequalities. So I know that Bell inequalities are

248
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,400
particular case of non-contextuality inequalities. But by just saying that this idea of black box

249
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,840
works very well if we have space-life separated parts. So I agree with it. But if we have a

250
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:52,560
black box that is localized, so as the kind of box people use when they are discussing,

251
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:59,680
for example, resource theory for contextuality. So we have this box with many inputs. So in this case,

252
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:09,600
if we have contextual data, we not necessarily have a non-classical phenomenon or something like

253
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:19,360
this. So I agree with it. So if the boxes are space-life separated, then we need non-locality.

254
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,920
I see your point. Okay, I will check on the details because you have a paper on this,

255
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:32,960
I've seen on the web. So I will check next week. But now we are on time. So we thank again Alison

256
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:42,240
for this nice talk. Thank you. Thanks Alison. So now we call Diego to share your screen.

257
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:55,360
So Alison, okay, great. So thanks Alison. So now we are on time for the Diego's talk.

258
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:05,440
Great, great. So now we're glad to have Diego Boussandri from the Institute of Physics La Plata

259
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,320
and the National University of La Plata. And he will speak about revisiting maximal

260
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,800
fidelity of teleportation. Please Diego, go on. Thank you very much for the presentation.

261
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:27,040
So let's talk. Diego, wait, your sound is low. You could speak like this and it's good, but if you

262
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:33,200
could. Now? Now it's much better. Thanks, thanks. Please, go on. Thank you.

263
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,880
Sorry. No problem, no problem.

264
00:30:48,880 --> 00:31:00,160
Now, okay, let's talk about then about fidelity of teleportation. This is a work we made with

265
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:10,720
Madeira Portesi and Anna Masté. And so what did we do? We obtained the maximal average

266
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:19,120
fidelity of teleportation or the score of a given protocol for two situations, the standard

267
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:28,560
quantum teleportation protocol characterized by a particular measurement. So one second.

268
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:40,880
Now, we calculate so the maximal average fidelity of teleportation for the...

269
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,040
The sound is again low. I don't know if everyone is...

270
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:54,320
What happened? Now? Yeah, now it's better. Yes. Sorry, sorry. No problem.

271
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,680
Then we obtained the average identity in two situations, the standard quantum teleportation

272
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:09,120
protocol characterized by a particular measurement in which there is a projection onto the bell

273
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,760
bus. And another protocol whose characteristic measurement is something in the middle between

274
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:26,640
the computational basis and the bell, bell bus. But our differential feature is that we calculate

275
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:37,360
this for isotropic distribution of input states, not only the heart measure. I mean not only your

276
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:52,640
estimates. So we are going to talk about useful protocols. Namely, a protocol is useful when

277
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:01,280
its average fidelity is greater than the classical one. Our key point or our main result is that

278
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,560
when you take an average of a more general distribution than the heart measure,

279
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:18,320
the quantum teleportation protocol can be useful when your resource has no quantum correlation.

280
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,360
So even for a classical quantum estimate.

281
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:32,800
Well, what is the meaning of the fidelity of teleportation? Let us suppose that we have a

282
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:41,600
protocol p producing output s state given by rho a out with probability p i for an input s state

283
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:52,400
or a qubit state given by rho a. And rho a is characterized by its block vector t.

284
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:03,600
And so if you want to know how well the quantum teleportation was performed, you can quantify

285
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:16,960
the similarity between rho a and the final output, calculating equation one. But this mesh
