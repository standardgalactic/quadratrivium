1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,360
Okay, we are back with the next speaker of this morning session, who is Carlos Gerardo

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:21,440
Czepelewski of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and he will speak about on super

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,360
deterministic rejections of settings independence.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,760
Please Carlos, go on.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,600
Thank you Federico, and thank you to all the organizers of this conference on quantum

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,100
foundations.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm very grateful to be here and to be able to share with you work that I find particularly

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,600
interesting.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,880
This work was made with collaboration with Elia Sokon and Ernest Sudarski, who are also

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:01:03,240
doing the call, perhaps even in the questions they can offer their insights.

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:12,440
Okay, this work is going to be published next year in the British Journal for the Philosophy

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,680
of Science.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,320
So okay, as a way of introduction, let me say a little bit about the motivation of this

14
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,960
work.

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,120
Because of the presence, the existence of Bell's theorem, and the fact that we have

16
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:37,040
performed many, many times the relevant experiments related to such a theorem, it seems that there

17
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,200
is some, there are some non-local features in the universe.

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:52,000
And we will see the details in a minute, but as an introduction, let me just say that

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,160
if one wants to avoid this conclusion, it seems that possibly the only way to do so

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:06,360
is to deny one of the assumptions in the theorem called settings independence.

21
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,920
It might be that there are other assumptions in the theorem, but I would say that in most

22
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,280
cases, I do not see any way of denying the other type of assumptions, or in general,

23
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,920
I do not see other important assumptions that appear in the theorem.

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,400
Then the work of non-locality becomes the work of seeing what reasons do we have in

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,280
favor of settings independence, and what reasons do we have to believe in some of the ways

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,280
of denying such an assumption.

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:52,920
And in working on this evaluation of arguments, we stumbled upon a very interesting model

28
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,040
that is going to be the subject of today's talk.

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,840
Okay, so this is the structure of what we are going to do today.

30
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,600
We're going to do a quick overview of Bell's theorem.

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,320
Then we will move to discuss the assumption of settings independence.

32
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,440
We will pay special attention to what reasons do we have to believe that something like

33
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,720
settings independence is true, and what kind of reasons or what kind of models might be

34
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,760
able to still say that such an assumption is incorrect.

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,240
Finally, we're going to introduce the local pilot wave, this model that I think is really

36
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
interesting.

37
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,440
So let's start with Bell's theorem and a very quick overview.

38
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,600
I think that most of the people in this call and in this conference are familiar with the

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,240
theorem, but it will be a good exercise to go into the overall structure of the theorem

40
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,040
and what it states.

41
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,600
So we have a typical Bell type experiment where we prepare an ensemble of two particles

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,080
and we send them to distant locations.

43
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,360
In one location we have Alice's lab and in the other we have Bob's lab.

44
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:17,440
The capital A and capital B stand for the results of the experiments that each one performs.

45
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,480
The results only can be up and down.

46
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:30,360
Alice and Bob are measuring the spin of the system that is sent towards them.

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,320
Of course, I don't know if I mentioned this, but the ensemble is of systems that we would

48
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,360
describe singlets in quantum mechanics.

49
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,560
Lowercase A and lowercase B stand for the settings that Alice and Bob use, for example

50
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,640
the angle by which they put the Steng-Erlach or another measuring device they are using.

51
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,760
And lambda is going to be a description, a complete description of the system that Alice

52
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,160
and Bob are measuring.

53
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,560
So we are interested in this experimental setup.

54
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,160
And Bell's theorem assumes two things regarding this general setup.

55
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,480
The first thing is called local causality.

56
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,640
And the idea of local causality is that suppose we have two distant regions and suppose that

57
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:32,360
we have a complete specification of whatever is happening in a slide of the past hyperverse

58
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:46,040
surface of this first region where something happens, a bevel kite occurs, some event occurs.

59
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:52,640
And the idea of local causality is that if I have information regarding sigma and this

60
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,240
information is complete, then whatever is happening outside in that other distant region

61
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,840
must be irrelevant.

62
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,360
In other words, the probability of whatever is happening in the first region must be independent

63
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,200
of whatever happens in another region.

64
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:19,680
Because I have conditionalised on sigma.

65
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,640
In the theorem, this assumption takes the form of factorizability.

66
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,760
I'm just going to assume that local causality implies factorizability for the purposes of

67
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,440
this talk.

68
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,360
So the idea is that the probability of Alice and Bob once we have the measuring settings

69
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,280
and the state of lambda, it goes like this.

70
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,240
We can factorise the probabilities.

71
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:51,120
The other assumption, and let me just state it, we will come back to it in a moment.

72
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,720
The assumption is that the distribution over this complete specification of the system

73
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,240
that Alice and Bob are going to measure is independent of the settings that Alice and

74
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,480
Bob use to measure their respective particles.

75
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,960
So Bell's theorem says that if one assumes factorizability and assumes settings independence,

76
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,920
then the expectation value for the product of the results of Alice and Bob, which is

77
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,800
this, is going to obey the inequality.

78
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,080
This is a particular inequality that can be derived.

79
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,760
There are many others that can be derived.

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,920
The interesting thing, so far Bell's theorem just is a derivation of this type of inequalities,

81
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,560
but it becomes interesting when one notices that according to quantum mechanics, this

82
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,520
combination of expectation values should be equal to two times the square root of two

83
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,040
and not less or equal than two.

84
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:08,000
We have performed the relevant experiments and we always find that quantum mechanics

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,080
seems to be right.

86
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,200
So the conclusion seems to be that, first, that no local theory can reproduce the predictions

87
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,040
of quantum mechanics and because of the experiments, it seems that the world has some non-local

88
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
features.

89
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,240
Okay, that is the overview of Bell's theorem.

90
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:40,040
Now we go to describe this assumption of settings independence and why it would be, why we would

91
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,200
consider it a reasonable assumption.

92
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,320
So as I said, the assumption is very simple to state.

93
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,880
It says that the distribution of the lambdas is going to be independent of the settings

94
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,960
that Alice and Bob select.

95
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,840
Something that I forgot to mention is that in the experimental setup we are imagining.

96
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,800
We want to be as general as we can.

97
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,760
So the idea would be that each time we prepare a system in a singlet, we are not going to

98
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:23,680
assume that there is a unique, complete description that is appropriate for that situation.

99
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,320
At much, we are assuming that each time we prepare a system in a singlet, we have a distribution

100
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,120
over the states of lambda.

101
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,800
And well, then settings independence is the idea that this distribution of whatever is

102
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:47,400
really happening is independent of how Alice and Bob measure the system.

103
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,760
Two comments regarding some confusions that have a reason regarding this assumption.

104
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,880
The first one is that this assumption has nothing to do with the free will of either

105
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
Alice or Bob.

106
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,840
There is a long tradition of people being confused because of this and there is even

107
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:14,640
theorems regarding the free will of the particles involved.

108
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,800
That seems to be a confusion.

109
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,720
It's easy to see that it is a confusion when one realizes that this is just an assumption

110
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,560
regarding the statistical character of the distribution of lambda.

111
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,440
Another confusion has to do with how to understand the lambda that appears at this moment.

112
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,520
The thing is that lambda at this point must be understood as the complete description of

113
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,760
the singlet of the system that we have prepared and that we call the singlet.

114
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,560
This is before I mentioned when I was talking about the assumption of local causality that

115
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:56,040
there is this complete specification in the past of region.

116
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,560
And some people think that lambda should be understood as this complete specification

117
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,480
of the hyper-surface in the past of region.

118
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,360
But in the theorem, lambda is not that.

119
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:18,800
Lambda is just the complete specification of the system that Alice and Bob are measuring.

120
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,680
Why would someone believe that an assumption like setting independence is reasonable?

121
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,800
The answer is that we have performed the relevant experiments and we have used a lot

122
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:38,640
of methods to randomize how we choose either A and B.

123
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,400
So we have used random number generators.

124
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,360
We have used the digits of pi.

125
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,600
We have used information coming from distant quasars.

126
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,720
We have used even stranger things like the binary strings that can be extracted from

127
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,080
information of popular movies and TV shows.

128
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,280
For example, we have used information coming from the movies of Star Trek and Monty Python

129
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,800
and the Holy Grail.

130
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,920
And we have used that strings of binary digits to select the settings that Alice and Bob

131
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
are using.

132
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:24,840
And finally, we have even used inputs from a lot of people to perform these experiments.

133
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Why is this relevant?

134
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:34,080
Well, the idea is that by choosing the settings randomly, we are, in effect, erasing any kind

135
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:40,160
of correlations that we might expect that are present between the settings that we are

136
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:49,040
using and the state of lambda.

137
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:59,960
In the absence of some reason to believe that the correlation must be preserved, we think

138
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:06,400
that these kind of processes ensure us that the settings are being chosen randomly.

139
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,200
I hope that that is the main reason why we think that something like settings independence

140
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,720
is a good idea.

141
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:20,800
And as it might be obvious to some of you, it might not be obvious to some of you, but

142
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,680
an assumption like settings independence is present each time we perform an experiment

143
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:33,040
in the sense that we assume that how we are measuring something must be independent of

144
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
the system we are measuring.

145
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,440
Let me be precise.

146
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:47,040
We need to assume that it is possible to make those measurements in a way that is independent

147
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,720
of the system we are trying to measure, okay?

148
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Okay.

149
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
That's good.

150
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Okay.

151
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,960
Still, there are two possible ways of denying settings independence.

152
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:06,560
The first one is to assume a retrocosal model and to assume that it is the selection of

153
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:15,440
the settings by Alice and Bob that causes changes in the lambdas that we have prepared.

154
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,560
So the idea would be something like what is depicted in this diagram.

155
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,800
The idea would be that we prepare the singlet state and it moves towards Alice's lab, for

156
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:35,400
example, and when Alice decides or uses some device to select the setting IA, that information

157
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,320
travels backwards in time and then reaches Bob.

158
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,840
This would be a way to deny settings independence.

159
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,760
We are not going to talk about this possibility in here.

160
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,000
We're going to talk about the second possibility of denying settings independence, which has

161
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,040
the name of super determinism.

162
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:05,720
The idea would be that there is a common cause between all the elements in the experiment

163
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:12,080
between the state of lambda that we are preparing and whatever is happening in the locations

164
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,080
of Alice's lab and Bob's lab.

165
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,040
Notice that because we have performed with these experiments using information coming

166
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,920
from these processors, the common cause must be really, really back in time.

167
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:35,240
And it must be a really particular common cause because it is somehow preserving the

168
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,800
correlations between the settings and the state of lambda, even though we have used

169
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,880
a lot of different things to try to randomize how we select AMB.

170
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,280
It would be something like akin to having a system that undergoes physical mixing, but

171
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:04,560
preserves a particular correlation, even though there is a lot of intricate and ever pressing

172
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:14,120
different physical processes that we would think would erase any type of correlation.

173
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:21,880
So these two possibilities seem to most people far-fetched.

174
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:28,640
In particular, super determinism looks really bad, at least because of three reasons.

175
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:35,160
It seems that a theory that a super deterministic theory would be too complicated.

176
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Why?

177
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:43,600
Because it would somehow be able to correlate these ways in which we randomize the settings

178
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,880
of Alice and Bob with the state of lambda, and that seems too cumbersome.

179
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:56,320
Second, it seems that doing this kind of move where we are saying that the correlation will

180
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,880
be explained by postulating there is a common past is like abandoning the project of finding

181
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,000
an explanation of whatever is happening.

182
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,440
Suppose we have a correlation between two variables, it is always possible to say that

183
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,320
the correlation was there because the initial conditions of the system were interested in

184
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,560
were such and such.

185
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,400
It seems that we are not giving an explanation, we are just assuming something about the initial

186
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,520
conditions of the system.

187
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:33,120
Lastly, it seems that such a position would jeopardize all experimental science.

188
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:41,280
As I said, an assumption like settings independence is present in all type of experimental procedures

189
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
we perform.

190
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:50,040
And if we want to deny settings independence, in this case, what makes us stop there?

191
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,920
Perhaps we should abandon this assumption and we should abandon the enterprise of doing

192
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,840
science in general.

193
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,960
So that is settings independence.

194
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,560
Those are the reasons why we believe that it is a reasonable assumption.

195
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,720
And what are the problems that we might encounter with a super deterministic theory?

196
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:22,800
I will now present our model and let me start by pointing out the trick that we are going

197
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
to use.

198
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:32,160
We are going to turn standard pilot wave theory if I am not going to give the details of this

199
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:40,920
theory but during the questions perhaps sometimes it will come back again.

200
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,880
But we are going to turn this standard pilot wave theory into an equivalent but a fully

201
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,560
local model and we are going to do a trick to do so.

202
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,120
And it will be useful to have a name for this trick.

203
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,760
I am going to call it a linear smooth, I am not going to explain why, but the idea is

204
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:07,600
to put in each physical space, point in space the information regarding all the other points

205
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,160
in the universe.

206
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,640
It should be clear that by doing that it is possible to transform the dynamics of the

207
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,640
model we are constructing in something that is local.

208
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:28,000
The idea would be that each point has the information to do whatever it does without

209
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,680
the presence of any other particle.

210
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:42,240
So in standard pilot wave theory we have two equations of dynamical equations, the first

211
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,080
one is just the Schrodinger equation and we have also the guiding equation that gives

212
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,360
you the dynamics of the hidden variables that theory proposes which are just particles

213
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,160
and their positions.

214
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,160
We are going to use this linear smooth and what we are going to do is to suppose that

215
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,760
at each point in the space there is an internal, there is a set of internal degrees of freedom

216
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:15,760
which are going to be a wave function field and a position field for each point.

217
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:24,840
And doing so it is possible to obtain a dynamic that is fully analogous to the previous two

218
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:37,920
equations but we are now dealing with wave function fields and the position fields.

219
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,280
And two comments regarding this move.

220
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,480
The first one is the internal degrees of freedom at each point they behave as an n particle

221
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,640
pilot wave system.

222
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,440
So the idea would be that for each point in physical space we now have an n particle typical

223
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,720
pilot wave system.

224
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,600
And the second would be that the second observation would be that the theory only contains local

225
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:17,080
bibles in the sense that it is not describing some interaction between whatever is happening

226
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,960
between in these points the dynamics is completely described by what is happening at each one

227
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,680
of these points and therefore it is completely local.

228
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:36,240
To connect this the model with whatever we find in physical space we specify mass density.

229
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,360
This allows us to say that a particular point in physical space is populated by matter only

230
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:50,480
if the particles in the internal degrees of freedom of such a point in physical space

231
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,200
have a particle being occupied.

232
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,800
So it would be imagined that you have a point in physical space there is the internal degrees

233
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,320
of freedom and in those internal degrees of freedom there is a particle that is at the

234
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:13,840
same point that this point or that this physical point is then we find matter there okay.

235
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:23,480
Okay crucial observations for generic conditions we the model is we don't have much okay.

236
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:31,120
We don't have violations of the belt inequalities and we don't even have predictions of the

237
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,480
predictions of quantum mechanics okay.

238
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:44,240
But it is easy to see that under very particular initial conditions that is if the wave function

239
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,320
field and the position field are the same for each physical point in space then we

240
00:22:51,320 --> 00:23:02,320
have three clear consequences the first one is that the points become suddenly coordinated

241
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:10,040
and we have a dynamics that seems like it is describing some universe where things interact

242
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:17,360
causally but in fact we just have points that are being coordinated.

243
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:24,920
Second we are able to recover all the predictions of the standard pilot wave theory and three

244
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:32,240
where we have the violations of belts inequalities two and three are related since in pilot wave

245
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,360
theory we have violations of belts inequalities okay.

246
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:45,680
I'm not going to go into the details of this but the question becomes well how can we achieve

247
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:53,240
such an such an homogeneity condition and in the paper we discuss three ways of doing

248
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:01,000
it the first one is by putting it by hand the second is by imposing it imposing it as some type

249
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,120
of low-like constraint and the third one is by doing doing so dynamically perhaps during the

250
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:16,760
questions we can talk a little bit about this but okay regarding the the problems that

251
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:24,360
super deterministic theories seem to have what can we say about our model well I think that

252
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:33,000
it is interesting to note that our model shows that it is possible to create a super deterministic

253
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,520
model that doesn't have the kind of problems that people feared as it should be obvious that the

254
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:48,280
conditions required to have a workable model are not as complicated as people thought they would be

255
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,240
the second point is that well it has as much explanatory power as the standard pilot wave

256
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:05,480
theory has and the third is that the the the model shows that explains why settings independence

257
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,880
is violated for belt type experiments but it doesn't say that settings independence should

258
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:18,440
be violated in other types of experiments in science so there is no threat to experimental science

259
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,680
there are some problems with the model the the model is is really ugly we are not trying to argue

260
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,560
that this is a good way to do physics in the world we are just showing that it is possible to

261
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:37,880
construct this model and that it is a a good place to continue having the discussion regarding

262
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:45,160
whether or not something like super determinism is a reasonable possibility in more detail

263
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:53,320
the the the model seems to require an absolute rest frame and second there seems to be a

264
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,280
disconnect in the model between what we can call the the ontology of what is really happening

265
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:06,680
according to the theory and what what what we can have contact with so the theory postulates this

266
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:14,600
internal degrees of freedom for each point in physical space yet we cannot go and see those

267
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,120
internal degrees of freedom in fact the theory says that we cannot do that okay we because of

268
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:28,200
the mass density we are explicitly says when can we note something about all of this in

269
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:35,560
internal degrees of freedom and it's under very particular conditions lastly there is an obvious

270
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:49,240
massive enlargement of the ontology in this model and so okay let me finish with a list of contributions

271
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:57,640
that this work has done and in particular that can be seen as consequences of constructing this

272
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,560
model so we have presented a model that is completely local and is able to reproduce the

273
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:10,440
predictions of quantum mechanics it does so without being too complicated without losing

274
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,560
explanatory power and without making all experimental science obsolete so the problems

275
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:23,080
with this model were not the ones that many people feared at least there are not these three

276
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:31,000
problems and so as a proof of concept it shows that it is possible to construct a super deterministic

277
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:43,240
theory in a way that keeps the physical details of what is happening and finally the model does this

278
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:52,920
all of this by very cumbersome methods and doesn't seem to be to offer any advantage over

279
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:06,760
other alternatives that are non-global that's it okay thanks Carlos thanks for this very nice talk

280
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:15,000
we are almost on time so if someone has a very short question you can post it now otherwise

281
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,040
I invite Elias to start sharing cream but if someone has a question for Carlos please go on

282
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,360
I had of course questions but I think we are we are quite on time but my question was something

283
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:37,080
like we can of course speak later or by email or something like that but you claim that the world

284
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:44,920
is non-local right but then how can you have in a non-local world device measurements independence

285
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,920
for example you will claim that in belly inequalities you don't have measurements

286
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,880
independence or something like that because it is non-local and then in your definition of super

287
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,520
determinism I don't understand because if you want super determinism or if you want to avoid it

288
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:07,800
because when you post a model like in Leibniz everything is super there is no in Leibniz

289
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,000
metaphysics there is no the measurements independence because the monads every monads

290
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,240
knows what to do and knows what the rest of the monads are doing so everything is super determined

291
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:29,160
by the the most perfect world chosen by God so it's not clear for me what what you at least

292
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,720
the conceptual definitions right what do you want you are completely right in the sense that if you

293
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,760
believe in something like the the universe of Leibniz's monads or the kind of universe we are

294
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:49,000
describing with this model yes that's a way to deny settings independence and yes that is a way to

295
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,880
to to keep locality but I think that most people would agree that that's a price to high to pay

296
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,840
I think I think
