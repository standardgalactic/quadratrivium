0	29000	So, thank you for the invitation. It is a pleasure to be here. I have been presented in my works in this series of conference since 2017, I think, and it is a pleasure to continue to present my work here.
29000	31000	So,
34000	43000	first I want to present my collaborators that are part of the organizers in this conference.
43000	60000	Professor Gustavo Mart√≠n Bozic, and Mariela Portesi, that are from the University of La Plata, and Steve Sosor, that is from France.
60000	82000	And you can see our work that starts, this collaboration started in the first conference that attend in this series, and, well, it's in the archive, and this is the work.
83000	95000	So, I want to take the title of this conference that said that 10 irreversible years on quantum foundation in Argentina.
95000	109000	I want to give you a brief motivation of our work that is based on a quantum.
109000	113000	So,
113000	127000	quantum irreversible thermodynamics. In quantum irreversible thermodynamics, the main goal that
127000	146000	the people want to achieve is how to describe in an arbitrary open quantum evolution, the rate of change of the von Neumann entropy, and
146000	163000	based on in thermodynamics way of thinking, this rate of change is splitting in two parts. One is the rate of change of the production.
163000	169000	And the other is the rate of change of the entropy flux.
169000	186000	The second law of thermodynamics is just the statement that the first part, that is the rate of change of entropy production is always a positive or zero.
186000	205000	There is a big open question, which is the general way to do this is splitting in a general open quantum evolution, but the problem is solved in several cases.
205000	222000	And this type of analysis gives a clue of how to analyze the stationary situation like equilibrium situations in open quantum evolutions.
222000	230000	For example, the stationary situation is the balance between these two terms here.
230000	243000	And when the balance occurs, but also each of these terms is zero, this corresponds to thermal equilibrium. Okay.
243000	261000	But I want to present here an alternative way to, at least in a particular kind of open quantum evolution, but very important kind.
261000	282000	And I will present another splitting of the rate of change of the von Neumann entropy that is associated with the notions of fluctuation and dissipation, and this new splitting
282000	287000	allows to analyze the stationary situations in a different way.
288000	293000	So this is the main motivation of our work.
293000	302000	And as I will, I will introduce, which is a notion of fluctuation and dissipation in classical market processes.
302000	320000	I will talk about the additive noisy Gaussian channel and how to generalize this very important channel in classical information theory to a more general channel that the general Gaussian channel.
320000	340000	So we start to talk about quantum open quantum dynamics, and how to describe a memory less quantum communication channels that are continuous in time.
340000	354000	And all of these kind of memory less quantum channels, continuous in time are described by a one parameter quantum dynamical semi groups.
354000	362000	Then I will present the main result of our work that is a new
362000	366000	composition of the infinitesimal generator.
366000	382000	Non-unitary infinitesimal generator associated with this one parameter quantum semi groups that verifies a link blood type of master equation.
382000	390000	Then I will show how this decomposition infinitesimal generator
390000	403000	allows to write the rate of change of the von Neumann entropy in a particular way, where you can identify the fluctuation dissipation terms.
403000	417000	And this is the quantum and a lot of the classical a very well known, the breaching identity that appears here in classical market process.
417000	428000	And then I will compare our approach with the approach of the thermodynamics in terms of dynamics.
428000	437000	And I will give an example in a one parameter channel quantum Gaussian channels.
437000	445000	Well, so let's start with a noisy fluctuation classical information theory.
445000	453000	The most important type of channel here is the additive noise Gaussian channel.
453000	466000	That corresponds appears in embedding natural random processes and that has that are view as a large sum of noises sources of noises.
467000	472000	If you combine this with the central limit theorem.
472000	477000	You end up with this type of channels.
477000	488000	So the channel is is you have a random variable, and you combine with a noise that is described by a normal distribution random viable.
488000	492000	And this square root of t is the strength of this noise.
492000	503000	Okay, so the probability distribution of the random variable at the output of the channel verifies the very well known heat equation.
504000	526000	So, the quantification of the of the fluctuation or noise in this channel is given by the original the classical a debris debris identity that was approved for by a stamp in 1959.
526000	532000	And it's the rate of change of the channel entropy here.
532000	538000	And this rate of change is proportional to the efficient information.
538000	550000	This efficient information is the so called efficient information associated with displacement, where you can.
551000	563000	This displacement depends like any efficient information by a parameter tita but this parameter because he's at this placement.
563000	575000	And this appears and this type of efficient information is also known as an parameter efficient information.
575000	594000	And this quantity is always positive. So this classical debris identity only says that the fact that this random variable because becomes more random as time increase.
594000	596000	Okay.
596000	615000	The generalization of this type of channels in classical information theory is given by the so called a focal plant channels that correspond to multi dimensional channels that are modeled by lunch on forces.
615000	620000	These are described by a stochastic differential equation.
620000	635000	And the more important type of these channels are the so called a general Gaussian classical channels that correspond to Einstein, you'll impact processes.
635000	646000	The processes are described by this stochastic equation. The first term is the drift vector.
646000	654000	Here, this x is a vector that is the multi dimensional random variables.
655000	671000	And the second term of the differential question is the standard binary process that is characterized by this matter here that is known as the matrix of lunch on forces.
671000	683000	The probability distribution of associated with this vector of random variables, verifies a linear focus on equation. Here is the linear from the equation.
683000	701000	Where the first time is the drift turn on the second one is the diffusion term that is characterized by this matrix D that is written in this way with this matrix of lunch on forces.
702000	717000	In the case, for example, when this random variable x is just a phase space variable in a classical mechanical system.
717000	733000	The typical example of in this case is the description of their classical Brownian motion that is given by this focus on equation with this space space variables.
733000	752000	The quantification of fluctuation and dissipation associated with this focus on equation is given by these generalizing classical everything that it was first written with this type of approach.
753000	764000	Information theoretical approach in in 2017 by what we will be so no show a lot.
764000	782000	And this is the brewing a identity. The first time is the contribution of the fluctuation here appears the diffusion matrix and this diffusion and also the matrix of fishing information.
782000	794000	And the second term is the contribution of dissipation. The first time is always positive could not be zero.
794000	800000	And the second time could be a positive negative or.
800000	802000	Okay.
802000	813000	In the case where you don't have a matrix one dimension, you recover the other discussion notes that we already see. Okay.
813000	838000	So, let's take a more deep loop at this structure of the generalize the classical the green identity. Okay, so the diffusion matrix is written in terms of this matrix of lunch on forces.
838000	847000	And because this matrix is a semi definite the finite positive.
847000	850000	You can write in this way.
850000	859000	Using the columns of the of the matrix of lunch event forces.
859000	874000	Of course this the composition is not unique, you can use any lunch on forces that are all described in this way.
874000	898000	If the columns of the of the matrix sigma here is a less than the nation of the of the random system, then the lunch on forces are linearly independent, and if you have more columns are the lunch on forces are not linearly independent.
898000	920000	But all this, if you fix the, you can, you can choose any description in terms of functional forces that for a given the.
920000	944000	So, using this the composition here, it is easy to see that this trace of this matrices here can be written in terms of the classical future information associated with the displacement probability distribution, and this placement is given by this a lunch on forces.
944000	946000	Okay.
946000	951000	Yeah.
951000	961000	For the second time this is the drift matters here.
961000	965000	You have a.
965000	986000	You can decompose this drift term here as a two type of forces, one is the anti symmetric part of the matrix that correspond to conservative forces and the symmetric part that do not conservative forces.
986000	999000	And it is easy to see that the conservative forces don't give any contribution here, and because are anti symmetric.
999000	1010000	And this trace here is just the average flux of the disability force.
1010000	1019000	That gives the total amount of change of the probability distribution in the direction of minus the physical force. Okay.
1019000	1040000	So, here you have a, for example, a good explanation of how the, the stationary situation, of course, because in the stationary situation this contribution of the, of the situation, mass, a, a,
1040000	1048000	in the counterbalance, these average flows of the disability force.
1048000	1050000	So, let's.
1050000	1062000	Now, we want to apply this ideas that appears in in classical and modern processes.
1062000	1089000	So, let's start talking about in general, what is a quantum channel, a quantum communication channel is just a map input output math that correspond to quantum mechanical operations.
1089000	1103000	And in the shooting a picture correspond to maps that are completely positive and specific serving that act on density matrix here, and are very specific.
1103000	1112000	In the has a picture this map can be described by an super operator that a present identity.
1112000	1124000	The picture has sent a picture, the preservation of the, of the density of the trace of the density matrix in the has a picture correspond to the preservation of the date.
1124000	1128000	Okay, this will be important.
1128000	1155000	In general, quantum channels, quantum communication channels are forms semi groups. If you compose a quantum channels, you have another quantum channel, and you have always a direction of time in this composition so it forms a semi group.
1156000	1179000	Quantum channels have an inverse only when are described by a unitary evolution. Okay, so the most common situation is always you have a situation where the environment affects the evolution.
1179000	1200000	So, the most common situation is to have a non unitary quantum channels, and this a non unitary quantum channels gives the gradation of information during, during their use, and in order to describe this degradation.
1200000	1220000	And to include some information about your implementation of the channel, and this gives the necessity to use maps that are continuous in time.
1220000	1237000	And when you use this type of maps to describe the situation the particular situation that you have, if you want to describe a memory less quantum channels.
1237000	1253000	You end up with an evolution that is describing always by the time independent Markovian master equation, and whose solution are one parameter semi groups.
1253000	1261000	So let's use this type of open quantum evolution to apply our ideas.
1262000	1268000	And here you have a link that master equation in general.
1268000	1280000	And these are L are the link that operators and the solution is given by this map here that this a dissolution.
1280000	1295000	And this in fit final dimension, always produce a type of type of evolution, and known as a one parameter quantum in a mechanism groups.
1295000	1302000	And this is also the case for the very important channels in continuous viral system.
1302000	1312000	That are that correspond with a to linear master equation that I, that I will show you in a minute.
1312000	1320000	So the infinitesimal propagator of this, the question, it has two parts.
1320000	1328000	The first one is the infinitesimal propagation associated with the unit evolution.
1328000	1334000	And the second is the asset with the knowledge.
1334000	1348000	So, we answer to this question that which is the general structure of the application dissipation one parameter quantum dynamical same group in general.
1348000	1361000	So, our answer is the following, which we found that the infinitesimal generator of the non-unitary evolution can be split in this way.
1361000	1368000	Here appears a three super operators here are written.
1368000	1386000	These super operators in terms of the link blood operators where we use for the link blood operators, the usual decomposition in in this real and imaginary a part of the of the
1386000	1390000	unitary a link blood operators.
1390000	1397000	So the first, the L one that appear here, all these super operators are real.
1397000	1402000	It means that maps are meeting operators in a meeting operators.
1402000	1409000	L one is also self adjoint with respect to the.
1410000	1414000	Schmitt.
1414000	1417000	It's kind of product. Okay.
1417000	1420000	And this.
1420000	1425000	Open cell up self adjoint operator.
1425000	1431000	I verify this, and this means that the map.
1431000	1440000	That if you use only this as a, as a infinitesimal generator.
1440000	1449000	The solution that you find here is a possible.
1449000	1467000	The other two, and two here, and three that combining in this way.
1467000	1472000	The other two is self adjoint L three is anti symmetric.
1472000	1489000	And the combinations of both also gives a, the, a possible infinitesimal generator one to the American senate loop in itself.
1490000	1493000	This is a composition.
1493000	1499000	It is very well known that the link blood operators verifies some symmetries.
1499000	1518000	The first symmetry that must be verified by the link blood operators is this one where you can apply any unitary matrix here to the link blood operators to obtain another link blood operators.
1518000	1521000	That describe the same system.
1521000	1522000	Okay.
1522000	1525000	Under this symmetry.
1525000	1530000	This, the composition are in barrier. Okay.
1530000	1537000	So, it's not affected by this type of.
1537000	1547000	The other symmetry that the link blood operators must verify is this one, while you change the link blood operators in this way.
1547000	1553000	And also, the unit that apart in this way.
1553000	1559000	Okay, well, the link blood operators appears in this Hamiltonian here.
1559000	1574000	If you apply this symmetry to our composition you see that L one and two are invalid and F three only a change but in a, in a unit that the way.
1574000	1582000	So, this means that appears only a contribution that this unit any.
1582000	1587000	A society with this Hamiltonian age.
1587000	1588000	Line here.
1588000	1589000	Okay.
1589000	1593000	H, H prime.
1593000	1603000	I will show you that the first part of this composition is associated with the fluctuation contribution to the Gaussian dynamic and semi loop.
1603000	1606000	And the other two to dissipation.
1606000	1608000	So let's see this.
1608000	1610000	Okay.
1610000	1618000	Here we have the unitary part, the non unitary. Okay, and these are our decomposition. Okay.
1618000	1627000	So, to see how this is associated with fluctuation and dissipation.
1627000	1631000	Let us calculate this.
1631000	1644000	The rate of change of the monomer entropy that can be split in this way, you were the first time is associated with the S this L one.
1644000	1655000	So this delta t is minus the trace of the, of the operator that involves here.
1655000	1670000	And here, you must put the self shown of L one, but because it's a, that's shown of L one, but because it's self shown appears.
1670000	1677000	So this term here, using this.
1677000	1684000	Well, the other time is you must put the other part.
1684000	1688000	Okay.
1688000	1697000	This is the first part here can be a
1697000	1708000	written using this relative entropy that is written here on the second derivative with respect to this parameter theta.
1708000	1725000	When you use this type of evolution here, it is easy to see that have this structure here with respect to this double commutator that is the generator of this unitary evolution here.
1725000	1732000	You can see that this type of structure appears here and appear here.
1732000	1738000	So, it is easy to see that the first term, it can be written in this way.
1738000	1751000	And this displacement of the quantum state is can be associated with the quantum luncheon forces.
1751000	1760000	And it's very interesting to see that this a
1760000	1764000	sorry.
1764000	1769000	This diversion basis quantum fishing information. Okay.
1769000	1782000	This is related with the relative entropy in this way. So the sum of a fish quantum fishing information, a relative, a relative entropy basis.
1782000	1796000	And measure the noise that this unit evolution do associated with the luncheon forces and testing the evolution.
1796000	1804000	There is a microphone that is open.
1804000	1819000	So, if we compare this expression here with the pressure that appears in the classical Gaussian channels that we found, we see a very similar structure here.
1820000	1839000	But also this is for the Shannon entropy, and this is for the one normal entropy. Okay, but you have also this part here that is the measure of the noise.
1839000	1844000	This is used in the dynamic but the luncheon forces here. Okay.
1844000	1853000	This is for classical Gaussian channels, and but this is for any one parameter quantum dynamics.
1853000	1866000	So, this is the quantum debris identity for any quantum dynamics. Okay, this is our main result of our work.
1866000	1871000	Let's compare how the
1871000	1875000	equilibrium appears in our description.
1875000	1882000	So we can use this quantum debris identity for one parameter point on the enemy can see me loops.
1882000	1893000	I use, you see that the stationer situation arise when these two terms balance because the first time is always positive.
1893000	1896000	It cannot be zero.
1896000	1904000	And in this situation situation, it must balance the second one. Okay.
1904000	1919000	In the case of the composition that appears in in irreversible quantum dynamics, it looks similar, but it's different. So this is not the same as this.
1919000	1927000	This is not the same as the second term is not this. Okay.
1927000	1942000	And in, in the problem with this description here is that, for example, for one in general, you, you, the, the, the splitting.
1942000	1954000	The expression that you have for this first time, for example, it depends on things of the environment.
1954000	1968000	You can avoid this problem and have an expression only with with ingredients from from the system and not from the environment.
1968000	1977000	And in quantum dynamical semi group, then this was a performance by the spawn.
1977000	1981000	And this pressure is this one. Okay.
1981000	1995000	And in this case, what but this only can be done, this only can be done when the quantum dynamical semi group has an stationary situation.
1995000	2008000	However, the composition is always true. You have this the composition, even if the quantum dynamical semi group do not have any stationary situation.
2008000	2019000	In this description, as I said, the stationary situation, distinguish between the stationary situation and equilibrium thermal situation.
2020000	2028000	And we will see that in our description, this is possible.
2028000	2041000	So, let's apply our approach to the so-called linear linear limbo master equation in one in continuous viral systems.
2042000	2050000	That are known as Gaussian dynamical semi groups in this type of open quantum evolution.
2050000	2065000	The Hamiltonian of the system is a quadratic in in the canonical conjugate operators and the limbo operators are linear in this.
2066000	2069000	Okay.
2069000	2076000	Yes, you have around five minutes, including the question.
2076000	2078000	Okay.
2078000	2083000	So, I will go quickly.
2083000	2104000	So, in this case, in for this type of system, the description for the bigger function of the system is verified the same a poker plan equation that the classical case, but in this case, the bigger fashion could be a probability distribution or not.
2104000	2122000	So, when the this bigger function correspond to Gaussian states. This is the, that are probability distribution, you have a description or the same description and the classical case.
2122000	2125000	In this case,
2125000	2133000	this channels preserve the guarantee, if you start with a Russian state, then you end up with a Russian state.
2133000	2152000	And in the stationary situation, if you if the system has a stationary situation, the station, the state is Gaussian, and all initial states and apps in that, if you start with any state, you end up in this Gaussian state.
2152000	2171000	So, let's, I want to show the quantum degree identity that we found in this case, you correspond if you apply this.
2171000	2185000	This is for any quantum dynamic assembly group, and to use the limbo equation, you end up with this quantum degree identity from Gaussian dynamic assembly groups.
2185000	2197000	And if you compare a for a with a classical case, you see a very similar structure.
2197000	2217000	Okay, but here's appear, for example, the, the matrix for the quantum division basis quantum information, and here appears the classical case.
2217000	2221000	Okay.
2221000	2225000	Well, let me.
2225000	2238000	But if you, if you apply a, if you start with a Gaussian state, that is, and in this quantum identity.
2238000	2249000	You can calculate the quantum division based fishing information and gives this special here.
2249000	2263000	And if you compare this with the Shannon entropy, you see a very similar structure also, but in this case, this matter that appear here and this matter that appear here are connected.
2263000	2268000	And you can prove this relation.
2268000	2277000	So, there is a relation of the quantum division identity and the classical division entity.
2277000	2286000	When you start with Gaussian states in quantum dynamic Gaussian dynamic assembly groups.
2286000	2297000	But in the case, if you analyze the situation when when you go to the equilibrium.
2297000	2300000	The equilibrium.
2300000	2308000	You, you go to the equilibrium in a way that this difference here goes to zero. Okay.
2308000	2320000	So, in the equilibrium, the monomer entropy, the rate of change of the monomer entropy goes to the rate of change of the Shannon entropy and goes both goes to zero.
2320000	2321000	Okay.
2321000	2326000	Let me show a, I will.
2326000	2352000	I want to, to, to, to distinguish equilibrium from a situation, I don't enter in this here I don't have time, but I want to show this last transparency that shows that our the composition
2352000	2372000	of the non-unitary infinitesimal proprietor of quantum dynamic assembly group is related with the coherence, and here we have the Gaussian dynamic assembly group in continuous system.
2372000	2377000	And I want to show a numerical simulation.
2377000	2388000	But the here, the simulation is not associated with a quadratic Hamiltonian, because I don't.
2388000	2394000	I use this from an old work on this.
2394000	2407000	So the non-unitary part is the same as the Gaussian dynamic assembly group, but the unitary part is not quadratic is a nonlinear evolution.
2407000	2416000	And here you will see the following if you start with, for example, with a Gaussian state that this is a coherent state.
2416000	2427000	And you start this part here, this coherent state evolves here with a non-linear kikar monic oscillator.
2427000	2428000	Okay.
2428000	2436000	And you see that the binger function starts to show interference pattern.
2436000	2455000	Now you, we have the non-linear, the two, the sum of the two evolution, the unitary plus the unitary that corresponds to the new unitary part of a Gaussian dynamic assembly group.
2455000	2467000	And in the, at the bottom, you have the classical evolution of not a quantum evolution, and you see that are almost identical.
2467000	2478000	So, in this case, we use a limit where this dissipative part is zero.
2478000	2481000	We only have this diffusion part.
2481000	2491000	So, this shows that diffusion of this is associated with the coherent states.
2491000	2495000	I'm sorry for this but we are on time.
2495000	2500000	We need to make a break before another session.
