00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Okay, welcome to the last session of the day.

00:04.000 --> 00:22.000
The next talk is in charge of Angelo Platino from the National University of La Plata, with the talk of Pauli Príncipe and Inflation.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Good afternoon everybody.

00:27.000 --> 00:38.000
There is no doubt that Pauli principle is one important piece of the foundations of quantum mechanics.

00:38.000 --> 00:56.000
On the other hand, cosmic inflation is one phenomenon associated to the big bang that helps to explain

00:56.000 --> 01:07.000
the large features of our universe that would be quite a mystery without cosmic inflation.

01:07.000 --> 01:20.000
Cosmic inflation has been invented 40 years ago, exactly in 1991 by Alan Goose.

01:20.000 --> 01:30.000
Okay, so this talk will try to connect the Pauli principle with cosmic inflation.

01:30.000 --> 01:51.000
This work has two co-authors, which are Mario Roca from my University of La Plata and Gustavo Ferri from the University of La Pampa, which is also in Argentina, some 800 kilometers from La Plata.

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
And it was published in the middle of the pandemics in July of last year.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Here is the reference.

02:05.000 --> 02:20.000
Okay, let's first of all try to briefly say what all this is about.

02:20.000 --> 02:43.000
We are trying to connect a basic concept of quantum mechanics that is the Pauli principle with a cosmic phenomenon which is cosmic inflation and with elementary statistical mechanics, very elementary statistical mechanics.

02:43.000 --> 02:53.000
And we begin with the number of microstates.

02:53.000 --> 03:08.000
And the assertion that because of the Pauli principles, a given number of fermions cannot be accommodated into arbitrarily small volumes V.

03:08.000 --> 03:17.000
So a minimum volume is needed to accommodate and fermions.

03:17.000 --> 03:31.000
That doesn't happen with motions, you can accommodate and motions in several volume, but this cannot happen with fermions, why because of the Pauli principle.

03:31.000 --> 03:44.000
And in this talk, I will try to connect what I just said about volumes with cosmic inflation.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
So the idea, the central idea is that to accommodate and fermions into a slightly determinant.

03:51.000 --> 04:10.000
That's the way one word fermions with slightly determinants, we need a minimum radius, which is a consequence of the Pauli principle, and we will extrapolate this ordinary simple statistical feature.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
We will extrapolate it to a cosmological setting.

04:15.000 --> 04:31.000
And we will be able to predict a special temperature value for the end of inflation, which agrees with the current estimates.

04:31.000 --> 04:39.000
Again, cosmic inflation is a widely accepted phenomenon, we need it.

04:39.000 --> 04:55.000
We slowly needed to understand the large features of the universe, but the details that particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation is unknown.

04:55.000 --> 05:15.000
So the basic paradigm accepted by most people in physics is that there was an exponential expansion of the universe very shortly after the singularity generated in the big bang.

05:15.000 --> 05:25.000
10 to the minus 36 seconds to 10 to the minus 32 seconds.

05:25.000 --> 05:43.000
And we will appeal now to micro canonical statistical mechanics to link the Pauli principle with the inflation, the cosmic inflation process.

05:43.000 --> 05:53.000
So in all this talk, I will be using the micro canonical.

05:53.000 --> 06:03.000
For example, of Gibbs, you know, there are three big ones, so three important ones, the canonical, the grand canonical, micro canonical.

06:03.000 --> 06:22.000
Most books deal with the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles but our arguments here belong to the micro canonical treatment of statistical statistical mechanics.

06:23.000 --> 06:43.000
And you can find the data relating more important data or most important data related to the big bang in this reference at the end of the page from 2014.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Okay.

06:46.000 --> 07:11.000
So let's start now with the most important relation of this paper which is the number of cells for the cell multiplicity for an n particle mono atomic ideal gas with energy e and volume V in face space.

07:11.000 --> 07:28.000
The number is equation one, the number of cells is a function of the volume, the energy and the number of fermions and some very well known constants.

07:28.000 --> 07:38.000
As I told you, you probably won't find this equation and ordinary textbook like one.

07:38.000 --> 07:48.000
The whole textbook, which is devoted only to the micro canonical ensemble is given here from 2014.

07:48.000 --> 08:04.000
And the authors is called lemons as student guide to end from different garbage university press. In this book you find all the whole of a statistical, the whole of elementary statistical mechanics.

08:04.000 --> 08:26.000
So this is our question one is our fundamental equation, which I repeat again as a question to

08:27.000 --> 08:47.000
we deal with the number of particles the volume and the energy because those are the thermal variables of the micro canonical ensemble so we are forced to use the man and no other ones for example not the temperature.

08:47.000 --> 09:01.000
The temperature belongs to the canonical ensemble, for example, but not to the micro canonical.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
Okay, again, equation three is the same equation, the number of cells.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
For and fermions.

09:10.000 --> 09:25.000
And now we give the volume, the standard form in terms of a field of a given radius and this radius will be important for our big bank considerations.

09:25.000 --> 09:32.000
This is the radius we need to accommodate and firm.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
Now, in a statistical mechanics.

09:38.000 --> 09:59.000
Since the multiplicity allows us to express the entropy remember that the Boltzmann entropy is equal to the Boltzmann constant times the multiplicity omega.

10:00.000 --> 10:23.000
To accommodate in n small cells, capital N fermions, you have the multiplicity of equation four, which is simple combinatorial expression that does not deserve much consideration.

10:23.000 --> 10:44.000
So here we are dealing with very large numbers of course so we can use stealing principle or stealing formula or stealing site and approximate the gamma function according to equation five.

10:44.000 --> 11:03.000
And then of the express the multiplicity that we need isn't the essential quantity in in a micro canonical description of anything, the main statistical mechanics quantity is the multiplicity.

11:03.000 --> 11:16.000
Equation six as you see is an awful very awful expression, because has it has our number of cells.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
Small n in the non exponential we have it in a logarithm.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
It's an awful expression.

11:25.000 --> 11:44.000
So to simplify this awful expression six, we change the scale of the, of the variable are the radius in the, in terms of a new variable is that it's a lot of our variables.

11:44.000 --> 11:52.000
So they will allow us for a more.

11:52.000 --> 12:13.000
For the multiplicity omega which is our equation eight, which follows below, in which now you see clearly that at least we see, we can present where the distance indicator is, is no longer the radius are insist it is the variable.

12:14.000 --> 12:28.000
It's small. Now we see it in appearing in exponentials and logarithms, but at least it is there.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Okay.

12:31.000 --> 12:46.000
Of course the multiplicity is a number which is larger than one which entails that it's lowering is larger than zero.

12:46.000 --> 12:57.000
Now we can take the logarithm of omega in equation eight to simplify things.

12:57.000 --> 13:18.000
And go to equation 10, which is the expression office blogging is still an awful equation but at least one gets an idea of what we are dealing with.

13:18.000 --> 13:25.000
And now comes our central point.

13:25.000 --> 13:44.000
The universe began or shortly after it began, it consisted of radiation and a gluon word plasma.

13:45.000 --> 13:57.000
Short time after the singularity variance begin begin to emerge.

13:57.000 --> 14:14.000
And these variants that emerge shortly after the big bang out to work glue and plasma are the protagonists of our tale of our story here.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
And we happen in equation 10 in an awful expression.

14:20.000 --> 14:27.000
But we will have this discussion.

14:27.000 --> 14:47.000
Well, variance just emerged. There were no variants. And suddenly, variance start emerging at the very beginning there will be just once later the term intent on the multiplicity omega will be equal to one.

14:47.000 --> 15:00.000
So, which is the solution for the variable in the radius indicator is to get that logarithm of omega is equal to one.

15:00.000 --> 15:13.000
That that is the essential point of the dog the whole talk revolves around the moment at which the first variants emerge.

15:13.000 --> 15:23.000
Form a slight determinant. There is no other way. And the multiplicity must be one because there is just one slight determinant.

15:23.000 --> 15:42.000
And what is the radius indicator is that gets the logarithm of omega equal to unit, which is that special value of s. So we have here I an equation equal to zero.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
This equation or 11.

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
And the question 11 has just two solutions.

15:54.000 --> 16:03.000
The radius indicator is can be zero, or the radius indicator is can be one.

16:03.000 --> 16:11.000
That solves the equation for getting multiplicity unity.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
But it cannot be zero.

16:14.000 --> 16:25.000
Because then the multiplicity omega would be negative, which is absurd.

16:25.000 --> 16:39.000
So the only possible solution to equation 11 is that the indicator of the radius indicator is the equal to one.

16:40.000 --> 16:57.000
And so suddenly, our first slight determinant within variance has a radius, which is not necessarily small.

16:57.000 --> 17:15.000
And the face transition is not just zero point something is one. There is a jump from s equals zero to s equal one instantaneously at as soon as any variance emerge.

17:15.000 --> 17:39.000
So let's go to a question seven remembers that is equal one implies a sign that the value for the radius of our in variance.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
And here we say okay.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
This jump in radius.

17:48.000 --> 17:56.000
Needed to accommodate the first and variance that emerges from the quarter one plasma.

17:56.000 --> 18:02.000
This jump of radius from zero to one constitutes inflation.

18:02.000 --> 18:25.000
Okay, so we are here and making the report hypothesis that the mechanism behind cosmic inflation is just a simple quantum statistical mechanics argument regarding multiplicity.

18:25.000 --> 18:35.000
And we have numbers because if it is equal to one.

18:35.000 --> 18:45.000
We can then, for example, try to estimate how many fermions, how many variants emerge at the beginning.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
This is the

18:50.000 --> 19:05.000
Of course, we need to know what is at the end of the inflationary period but that is a known number, the, the, the radius of the universe.

19:05.000 --> 19:26.000
The end of the inflationary period is 17 centimeters. So if we take our equal zero equal 17 centimeters we get a number of variants emerging

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
from

19:31.000 --> 19:40.000
the big bang from from the quarter blue and plasma excuse me, which is a large number.

19:40.000 --> 19:51.000
They all appear at the very beginning, and they are of the order of 10 to the 48.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
When variance emerge, it doesn't.

19:55.000 --> 20:10.000
They emerge as a whole bunch of or variance 10 to the 48, but you suddenly emerge out of the work blue and plasma.

20:10.000 --> 20:20.000
And they occupy a reasonable large radius of 17 centimeters.

20:20.000 --> 20:41.000
Note, however, that this number which is big 10 to the 48 is a small compared to the number of variants that we have today at the universe today at the universe we have of the order of 10 to the 79

20:41.000 --> 20:56.000
variant so 10 to the 48 is just a very, very, very tiny small fraction of the number of variants that we have today.

20:56.000 --> 21:09.000
And now comes a very strong point we believe a strong point for us for for our argument is not for us but for our.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Okay.

21:11.000 --> 21:19.000
We use the celebrated equation for entropy.

21:19.000 --> 21:37.000
Invented by boatsman that we find at the histone by the cemetery of Vienna, that the entropy is the ballman constant times the logarithm of the multiplicity omega.

21:37.000 --> 21:53.000
And we know that the temperature obeys the equation one over temperature is equal to the derivative of the entropy with respect to the energy.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Of course taken at the end is equal one.

21:57.000 --> 22:04.000
It's a simple equation 14 is what we have.

22:04.000 --> 22:26.000
And if you put the corresponding value, the corresponding numbers that we find that the temperature at the end of the inflationary period is a temperature of the order of 10 to 18 Kelvin degrees.

22:26.000 --> 22:33.000
And agrees with what people know about the inflationary period.

22:33.000 --> 22:40.000
They know a lot of things which are in a reference that I put at the very beginning of this talk.

22:40.000 --> 22:54.000
And one of the things that you will find is this kind of number that the temperate the inflation ended at the temperature of 10 to the 18 Kelvin degrees.

22:54.000 --> 23:07.000
And we obtain this value out of the micro canonical ensemble.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
So, I reached here the conclusions.

23:12.000 --> 23:29.000
So what we have done here is just a very, very envelope calculation using a simple micro canonical and statistical argument.

23:29.000 --> 23:46.000
And that shows that because of poly principle and fermions in our case and variants need a finite volume to exist.

23:47.000 --> 23:54.000
When they are all out of the world blue and plasma.

23:54.000 --> 24:03.000
They needed a volume of about the point 17 centimeters.

24:03.000 --> 24:16.000
And the micro canonical considerations tell you immediately that the temperature has to be

24:16.000 --> 24:34.000
of the order of 10 to the 18 degrees, which is what is needed to describe inflation.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
To end this short talk.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
What I have tried to show is that

24:44.000 --> 24:57.000
based on the poly principle that without any doubt is an important piece of the foundation of quantum mechanics is

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
half of quantum mechanics is the poly principle.

25:01.000 --> 25:08.000
That is starting with the poly principle and with the micro canonical ensemble of gifts.

25:08.000 --> 25:24.000
You can immediately do a very simple calculation that gives you a number that agrees with what people that work on the singularity on the big bang on inflation.

25:25.000 --> 25:39.000
That the temperature at the end of inflation is of the order of 10 to the 18 Kelvin degrees.

25:39.000 --> 26:04.000
What we see and this is then that the extremely simple micro canonical statistical argument can say is able to predict something about the universe of large from a very small piece of a statistical mechanics, we can say something about the whole universe at its beginning.

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
Thank you very much.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
Okay, thank you for your talk.

26:15.000 --> 26:26.000
Now we have some minutes for questions or comments.

26:26.000 --> 26:36.000
Thanks, Angel for this interesting talk.

26:36.000 --> 26:53.000
The Pauli exclusion principle is puzzling for me because any other quantum characteristic like entanglement or coherence in general will be destroyed by

26:54.000 --> 27:02.000
high temperatures that occur in cosmological events, but it seems that the Pauli

27:02.000 --> 27:10.000
destroyed I mean the coherence the coherence will destroy any any quantum quantum

27:10.000 --> 27:29.000
property but but it seems to me that the Pauli exclusion principle is still valid even even in in a in a very heated but surrounding the quantum system so do you have a word on that or a clue to understand better what's going on there.

27:29.000 --> 27:39.000
Well, I have done it in other context I have done calculations, the statistical mechanical relations.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
For example, with nuclear matter.

27:43.000 --> 27:55.000
You know when you have heavy ion collisions, which are done every day today, the temperature get very high but the Pauli session principle works fine.

27:55.000 --> 28:18.000
I mean, it's, that's why I was emphasizing that it is a very basic piece of the foundations of a statistical mechanics, although it is you are right, it is not clear why other quantum mechanical features seem to vanish.

28:18.000 --> 28:37.000
If you go to high temperatures because you go to the classical limit in the at high temperatures, but it seems that not the Pauli principle, even with the high temperatures that people get and in accelerators today in heavy ion collisions the Pauli principle is respected

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
is no way of violating.

28:40.000 --> 28:55.000
So it's something very strong that you are right from the philosophical point of view or epistemological point of view is not clear why, why it holds always.

28:55.000 --> 29:06.000
It's really, really puzzling I think it's a, it's a very an open problem and open problem I haven't found any explanation of that.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
From epistemology there is a big question.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
Yeah, because there is no classical limit.

29:15.000 --> 29:23.000
Yeah, if the classical limit would affect the Pauli principle, all matter will collapse, right?

29:23.000 --> 29:33.000
Exactly, so thanks to the Pauli principle we exist and we are in this beautiful meeting.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Thanks, thank you.

29:36.000 --> 29:42.000
Well, we are in time, so thanks.

29:42.000 --> 29:51.000
If we have some minutes, if there is another question.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
No.

29:54.000 --> 30:01.000
No, yes, we thanks to Angela for the talk and the people who participate with questions.
