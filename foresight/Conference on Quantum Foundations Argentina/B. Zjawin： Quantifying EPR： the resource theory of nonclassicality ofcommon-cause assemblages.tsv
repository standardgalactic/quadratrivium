880	8320	Yes. Okay, great. So, yeah, let me start by thanking the organizers
8320	12880	for the opportunity to present my work. It's actually the first time that I'm attending
12880	18160	this conference and I must say that I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed a lot of talks for the
18160	26080	past three days. So thank you for having me here. My name is Bata Ziawin and I'm a PhD student at
26080	31440	the International Center for Fury of Quantum Technologies at the University of Gdańsk in
31440	37040	Poland. And we have a Quantum Foundations group here. The leader of the group is Anna
37040	43200	Bellin-Sainz and as you can see she's also a collaborator on this work as well as David
43200	49920	Schmidt and Mati Homan. So today I will talk about quantifying EPR, the Resource Fury of
49920	59040	Non-Classicality of Common Cause Assemblages. We recently put this draft on our archive so
59040	63440	if you find what I will be talking about interesting you can of course ask me questions
63440	70720	but I also encourage you to look at the paper. Okay, so let me start with a question.
71920	79200	Is quantum steering spooky action at a distance? Because it is sometimes called this way. So the
79200	84800	steering phenomena is a form of non-classical correlations that arise when one considers
84800	91360	measurements performed on half of a bipartite system prepared on an entangled state. So if we
91360	98080	try to represent the situation graphically we end up with a picture like this. Here the double lines
98080	103600	correspond to quantum systems and single lines correspond to classical systems. So we have
104560	111200	we have two parties, we have Alice and we have Bob and they share entangled states. Alice prepares
111200	117280	measurement on it so this represents a measurement device that takes a classical input x and outputs
117920	126000	classical variable a and now depending on x and a on Alice's side Bob's system can be described
126080	134080	by this conditional quantum state row a given x. So why is it sometimes called spooky action at a
134080	141600	distance? Well it is because Alice and Bob are two space-like separated parties but it seems that
141600	149440	Alice can somehow steer Bob's system into this conditional state. So the term steering was
149440	156800	actually given by Schrodinger himself and he called it that because from this scenario it kind
156800	164480	of seems that maybe Alice has an influence on what's happening in Bob's laboratory. But this is
164480	169760	not the only perspective that we can take when we talk about this scenario and a different one was
169760	177600	endorsed actually by EPR themselves so by Einstein Podolski and Rosen in their original work and it
177600	184160	is that simply Alice updates her knowledge of the state of Bob's system by performing a measurement
184160	189760	on a system correlated with his and of course it makes perfect sense that Alice and Bob shared
189760	195360	a correlated system so when Alice learned something about it she also updates her knowledge on what's
195360	201840	happening in Bob's laboratory. So is steering spooky action at a distance? Well not really it's
201840	208800	neither spooky or action at a distance and because of this throughout this presentation I will not
208800	216240	refer to this phenomenon as steering but simply as EPR scenario where again EPR stands for Einstein
216240	224160	Podolski and Rosen. So well we could say that it's just a change of name and maybe from a technical
224160	229280	perspective well it doesn't make much difference but from the foundational perspective it actually
229280	235680	makes a huge difference how we look at this scenario. So let me just recap everything that
235680	242000	I just said so from Schrödinger point of view he called this phenomenon quantum steering
243440	250560	in a sense that quantum because he thought that quantum state is a physical property of a system
250560	256800	and then the fact that Alice steers Bob means that there is some kind of supergluminar causal
256800	263200	influence. So in the modern language we would call a set of beliefs that see ontic view which basically
263200	270240	means that this quantum states describe distinct physical states of the world. While what EPR
270240	277280	interpreted it as they said well spooky action at a distance is not really acceptable so quantum
277280	283200	state we can take it to be a representation of one's information about the system and then in
283200	289680	this scenario Alice simply learns about true state of Bob's system and this point of view
289680	298720	could be described in the modern language as epistering sorry which is basically that quantum
298720	304320	states represent states of knowledge about the world. Okay so after this foundational
306080	312800	motivation let me go into the actual resource theory. Okay so we will talk about EPR scenarios
312800	318880	and what we take to be the defining features of an EPR scenario are the following. First
318880	324400	common cause causal structure so as I said we have two parties Alice and Bob and they share a
324400	330400	common cause which in this case is quantum and the second defining feature of this scenario are
330400	337360	types of systems that parties have access to so on Alice's side it will be a classical input
337360	344160	and a classical output while on Bob's side it will be a trivial input because he has no input at all
344160	355200	and a quantum output. And it's very usual to describe EPR scenarios with quantum assemblages
355200	362880	so a quantum assemblages assemblage is an object like this where each conditional state
362880	367840	contains information about what's going on on Alice's side so this probability distribution of
367840	376400	obtaining an outcome A given an input X and what's happening on Bob's laboratory so this conditional state.
379200	385200	Okay so we want to create a resource theory of assemblages. Resource theories allow one to
385200	391600	formally quantify physical resources so in our case the resources are assemblages and what we
391600	397840	want to quantify is their non-classic quality. The structure of a resource theory is completely
397840	403120	determined by the set of three operations so three operations are operations that cannot
403120	408480	create a resourceful object and because of this they can also be applied to different resources
408480	414640	for free because if we apply a free operation to the resource it will not increase the resourcefulness
414640	422160	of it. And now for the case of assemblages our upload follows the recent developments of resource
422160	428320	theories for studying non-classicality of common cost processes wherein the three operations are
428320	434960	local operations and shared randomness so as I said an EPR scenario is simply a common cost
434960	441040	process and because of this we take a lesson from some papers that were already published
441280	447120	common cost processes are studied with LOSR operations and in particular there is this
447120	454800	paper here that basically creates a new branch of entanglement LOSR entanglement in contrast
454800	460960	to LOCC entanglement where CC stands for classical communication and that people usually talk about
462000	469360	and in this paper it is shown that taking this LOSR perspective actually resolves some anomalies
469360	477120	of entanglement and there is also this paper here which treats common cost boxes so things like
477120	482560	Bell's scenario where we have a common cost structure again but here both parties just
482560	489280	have access to classical inputs and classical outputs and because we can study both entanglement
489280	495200	and bell types scenarios using LOSR it means that we can also study their interplay which is really
495200	501040	amazing because it means that we can have like one unified resource theory of common cost processes
501040	507440	with different types of resources like entanglement bell boxes or assemblages and we can study
508160	514560	their relative non-classicality. I would also recommend this paper if you are interested in
514560	520400	this stuff because it talks about a type independent resource theory which considers even more types
520400	528160	than just entanglement assemblages and bell boxes. In the literature it was pretty well
528160	536640	motivated to study LOSR for common cost processes but even from simply looking at the DPR scenario
536640	542880	well we can see that it is a common cost process so we have two parties it's perfectly fine to
542880	548640	allow local operations for each of the parties local operations can be classical or quantum
549600	555120	it there will be quantum on both side and because we want to study the non-classicality
555120	562080	of assemblages we do allow classical common causes for free so what you can see on this picture here
562080	568560	on the right is an assemblage where the common cost is classical so Alice gets a classical
569120	576160	variable lambda and she performs her measurement while Bob prepares a quantum state depending
576160	584640	on the value of the classical variable and we call such assemblage a free assemblage because it
584640	591040	can be created solely by free operations so LOSR operations and it can be decomposed like this
591040	595920	so on Alice's side we just have this probability distribution where lambda is the short variable
595920	605520	and on Bob's side he prepares this quantum state. So for now I'll just mention that there are also
605520	612080	different approaches to studying non-classicality of assemblages and there is one resource theory
612080	618240	that was developed a few years ago that the set of the free operations in this resource theory
618240	624480	was the hasty one-way classical communication and local operations and after I'll introduce
624480	631600	our approach the LOSR one I will compare it to the previous one but I'll do it later on in my
631600	638640	presentation. Okay so what are these LOSR operations here in black we have the original
638640	645360	assemblage and now the most general LOSR operation that we can perform on it as first analysis side
645360	650960	we have a classical prep processing of this classical variable we have a classical post
650960	658560	processing of the output variable on Bob's side we have this post processing of his quantum state
658560	667600	so this will be just a CPTP map and now the actions of of local operations on Alice's side
667600	673840	and the local operation on Bob's side can be correlated by shared randomness so classical
673840	682080	common cause so this will be the lambda that's distributed to Alice and to Bob. Okay so now that
682080	687520	we have a resource theory and we have the set of free operations we can study the properties of the
687520	694080	preorder so we can study the relative non-classicality of assemblages and what we showed is that
694080	701200	assemblage conversion under LOSR can be tested using a single instance of a semi-definite program
702400	707360	so one assemblage is said to be more non-classical than another if it can be fairly converted to
707360	713280	the latter so if we have the black assemblage and we can convert it into a different one the one
713280	720880	with primes with free operations well it means that they can be used for example for the same task
721840	728640	because they have this one will be at least as non-classical as this one
730560	736880	so we showed that checking such conversions can be tested by checking if the following program is
736880	743040	feasible so I have the semi-definite program here but maybe let me not go into details about it
743360	748800	if any of you is like interested in the details I can just we can talk about it later doing the
748800	755280	questions but the important lesson here is that how this program works is that you just input
755280	760880	two assemblages and it tells you what there one can be converted into the other and it works really
760880	766480	fast it's just a single instance so it's really amazing because it's a great tool to study the
766480	773280	relative non-classicality of assemblages and we use this to study the structure of the preorder
773280	779200	and one interesting result that we found is an infinite family of incomparable resources so resources
779200	786320	that none of them can be converted into any other and this family goes like as follows so what we
786320	792240	checked is that we had in scenario where we have Alice and Bob and they shared this state here so
792240	799360	they share a partially entangled state now Alice performs sigma z and sigma x measurements on it
799920	805280	so such an assemblage would be described like this so Alice performs this measurement Bob does
805280	811360	nothing and they share this partially entangled state but now something else that we allow is
811360	818640	mixing with noise so the assemblage that we study is defined here so it's parameter parameter
818720	826320	randomized by these two parameters theta and p where theta corresponds to this theta here in
826320	833520	the partially entangled states and p corresponds to the level of mixing with noise so you can see
833520	840160	here that with some probability we create this element of the assemblage and then we mix it with
840160	847520	noise and now the results of the program that I just showed you are presented in this graph here
847520	854480	so here each dot corresponds to one assemblage so for example this one is an assemblage created
854480	860480	where Alice and Bob share a state with theta being equal to pi over four so it's a so-called
860480	867440	maximally entangled state and they don't mix it with noise because p is equal to one and now the
867440	873840	arrow from here to here means that under LOS operations we can covert this assemblage to this
873840	879120	one where this one is when Alice and Bob share a state with theta being equal to pi over 12
879120	887680	and they mix it with noise with this p being equal to 0.9 so as you can see we can like
887680	893040	using the sdp we can check whether different converters are possible but one interesting
893040	899280	property that we can see here is in this family here so for p being equal one for different
899280	907440	values of theta no conversions are possible and we actually we checked it analytically
907440	912320	and we showed that this is the family of incomparable resources so for all values of theta
913120	919840	from 0 to pi over 4 so like up to a so-called maximally entangled state all of these assemblages
919840	927200	for p being equal to 1 are incomparable and yeah we also developed some new epr monotone
927280	934320	in order to confirm this result analytically. Okay as I promised I'll now compare it to prior
934320	940400	work which was a resource theory of so-called steering under so-hastical collaborations and
940400	945600	one way classical communication from Bob to Alice so this set of free operations is of course a
945600	952160	valid set of free operations for epr scenarios which means that it cannot create a resourceful
952160	958320	object and it goes as here so again in black we have the original assemblage and in green
959280	967280	we have the free operation so here Bob has an instrument that he performs on his part of the
967280	973920	state and as an output he gets first of all the classical variable that he sends to Alice
973920	981120	and also his quantum state and now Alice has a classical pre-processing of her variable that
981120	986640	depends on the message that she received from Bob and she also has a post-processing
987360	993920	so the motivation behind the set of free operations was that the authors claim that
993920	1003040	is the most general set of free operations that does not compromise the security of one sided
1003040	1010320	device independent quantum key distribution protocols for them steering as a useful resource.
1011200	1016640	So the motivation here is a particular protocol in quantum information.
1017600	1022960	Okay so if you want to compare it to our work to LOSR approach the first thing that we can show
1022960	1029200	is a pretty big difference so the two resource theories actually have different pre-orders
1029200	1034800	which means that if we have a set of assemblages and we want to study it and we will study it with
1034800	1040400	two different approaches this one here and with our LOSR approach we can actually get
1040400	1048400	different results because the pre-orders are different. Now our LOSR approach has some conceptual
1048400	1055680	advantages over this one and one is that it has a clear physical motivation so motivation for
1055680	1061600	this approach here as one way LOSCC is this one sided device independent quantum key distribution
1061600	1069760	protocol while for our LOSR approach the the conceptual underpinning is more
1070560	1075360	foundational because it comes from the causal structure of this scenario and because of this
1076320	1081440	we have this unification of every type of non-classical correlation in bell-like scenarios
1081440	1088960	so we have a single LOSR resource theory for common cost scenarios and there are also some
1088960	1094640	technical advantages so for example our LOSR approach is simpler to characterize and study
1095600	1101280	this SDP this semi-different program is a good example that in our approaches it's really easy
1101280	1109040	to study the conversions and the other technical advantage is that our approach for the bipartite
1109040	1115120	scenario actually has some direct generalizations for example to multi-partite EPR scenarios but
1115120	1122400	also to bobov input and channel EPR scenarios where by channel EPR scenarios I mean something
1122400	1130480	that's usually referred to as channel steering and we left bobov input at channel for future work
1130480	1135680	but we did study the multi-partite scenarios so let me just say a few words about this right now
1136320	1142080	so let's go to a multi-partite setup which means that we now have more LSS for example this picture
1142080	1147680	here we have two LSS and as you can see everything just generalizes from the bipartite case so we still
1147680	1155360	have a common cost so we have the shared randomness that goes to each party and each party also can
1155360	1162480	perform local operations so we have local operations for Alice 1, Alice 2 and for Bob and what we
1162480	1169040	showed in the multi-partite scenario is that a sandwich conversion can be tested using a single
1169040	1173520	instance of a semi-definite program so we generalize the program that I showed you before
1173520	1179440	to to work for multi-partite scenarios and we also found a family of incomparable resources
1179440	1185520	so we have these two results that are very like they go in analogy to the bipartite case
1186320	1193680	but one thing that's a little bit extra here is a clear definition of a multi-partite free
1193680	1202960	assembled so again free assembled is one that can be can be created using only free operations
1202960	1207680	and since we study non-classicality the free assembled will be a classical assembled
1207680	1214000	or how people usually call it in the literature so an unsteerable assembled and actually there are a
1214000	1219360	lot of definitions of a free multi-partite assemblage in the literature the most general
1219360	1225680	that you will find is this one so it's that an assemblage is free if it can be decomposed
1225680	1230880	like this so we have this probability distribution for Alice's and we have the state for Bob
1231440	1235760	and actually in the most general definition there are no constraints on this probability
1235760	1242880	distribution here so for example this probability distribution is allowed to be signaling for each
1242960	1251200	lambda as long as the signaling average is out when we sum over all lambdas so such a thing is
1251200	1257760	usually referred to as fine tuning that we have this kind of undesired effect for for each lambda
1257760	1266320	but then it's average is out and it can be seen as problematic from some perspectives and there
1266320	1271760	are a few different problems that arise for this definition maybe I will not really go into detail
1271760	1280720	here but we don't have any of these problems in our LOSR approach so if we look at the set of
1280720	1288800	free operations again in our LOSR approach well it's pretty clear that a1 prime depends only
1288800	1296240	on x1 prime and lambda and a2 prime depends only on x2 prime and lambda so this probability
1296240	1303840	to distribution in our case will factorize so in our LOSR approach every assemblage is one
1303840	1310000	that decomposes like this so we don't really have any problems with signaling or any of the ones
1310000	1316800	that appear for this more general definition okay so that's pretty much it let me just make
1316800	1322880	some final remarks and so what I just presented to you was a resource theory of common cost
1322880	1330000	assemblages for bipartite and multi-partite EPR scenarios and it was motivated by a clear
1330000	1336320	causal interpretation of an EPR scenario that is a common cost that Alice and Bob share
1338160	1344800	thanks to this causal interpretation this notion is a unified notion of common cost resources
1345520	1351360	and it works for example for EPR scenarios but also for Bell scenarios and entanglement
1351760	1358560	we showed that testing convergence is numerically tractable which is very useful if you want to
1358560	1366240	study the preorder of resources and we use this result to show some interesting properties of
1366240	1372320	the preorder and finally in the multi-partite case we have a well-motivated definition of a free
1372320	1378960	multi-partite assemblage so thank you for your attention and I would be very glad to take any
1379680	1390800	questions okay thank you data for your talk now we have some minutes for questions or comments
1390800	1395440	if somebody makes a question please can you take this
1395680	1397680	can you check
1408480	1415040	yes um okay thank you and thank you for the talk I think it was very well
1415600	1422080	presented and I am a little confused about the general picture of what you're doing
1422480	1430560	um so okay let me try to state what I think is your project and let me relate it to some issues
1430560	1438480	that I that seem to be relevant okay so if I understand you correctly you first presented
1438480	1445360	the view of Schrodinger according to which there seems to be some type of action matter distance
1445360	1453360	in a typical EPR scenario and you said correctly that EPR themselves and in particular Einstein
1453920	1460000	had this view that well it might be that in reality quantum mechanics is not complete
1460000	1467840	and that the quantum state somehow reveals it's about the knowledge of Alice or Bob
1468800	1475520	okay that perhaps there is something more to the quantum state and in your case there seems
1475520	1484080	to be a reference to a common cause in the past of Alice's and Bob's labs okay and I just seem to
1484080	1494000	think that you can recover locality by this way of thinking and the problem I see is that well
1494000	1502960	that is precisely the starting point with Bell's work and with his theorem and his question was well
1502960	1511600	can we recover locality by doing something like whatever Einstein thought and his theorem is uh
1512160	1519760	no you cannot do it you cannot have a local theory and here's why because any theory that
1519760	1525520	that is uh non-local in this sense is going to make this uh inequalities is going to satisfy
1525520	1532000	these inequalities we go we check uh time and again we we notice that the inequalities are
1532000	1538480	violated and the the consequence seems to be that well any non-local theory is not going to work
1539040	1547520	so so let me know what am I missing and how is your yeah so you're not really missing anything
1547520	1554000	so let me start with your bell comparison so this is a bell type experiment right we have
1554000	1559120	a common cause and we have two parties and they make measurements so now if this common cause is
1559120	1565600	classical just by studying this causal structure so the fact that you have a common cause and you
1565600	1571840	have inputs and outputs you can derive bell inequalities and now if the common cause is
1571920	1580640	classical you can just like the the upper bound on the chsh inequalities too if the common cause
1580640	1587600	is quantum it's two times the square root of two and if it is allowed to be anything more but
1587600	1594000	there is still non signaling between the parties we have the pr box right so it goes up to four now
1594000	1602880	it's the same with epr scenarios so if this is a classical common cause then the assembler is free
1602880	1609840	and it's classical so as you said it kind of recovers the locality in in this sense but if
1609840	1617280	it's quantum we get assemblages that cannot be explained that's with classical physics okay but
1617280	1623200	then you must somehow be violating one of the assumptions of bell theorem right you must be
1623200	1629760	violating settings independence either by postulating some sort of common cause between
1629760	1634800	the state of lambda the the common cause and the settings of Alice and Bob or you're assuming something
1634800	1642880	like retrocausal theory in which Alice's settings somehow influence the the state of the the system
1642880	1650480	the common cause so for example here you can like put a box and you can make Bob make the
1650480	1657920	measurement and then it will be just like a standard bell scenario right so one way of looking
1657920	1666080	at an assemblage would be to see whether if Bob makes a measurement we violate a bell inequality
1669840	1675920	and like you could do so with the shared state is entangled right but if it's classical then you
1675920	1682160	cannot so you have to draw this line between what's classical and what's non-classical and
1682160	1691680	both for bells scenarios and for EPR scenarios this line can be decided based on the nature of
1691680	1696720	the common cause so if a common cause is classical then you will not violate a bell inequality but
1696720	1703680	if it's quantum so with the shared entangled state then you will get some some quantumness in this
1703680	1716400	scenario. Thank you. Does it answer your question or I'm not quite sure? Perhaps we should let other
1716400	1723520	people make questions and perhaps another time we can continue. Okay thank you. There is another
1723520	1737280	question from Federico Farlic but we have Federico. Yes thanks Beata for this very nice talk I wanted
1737280	1743680	to ask you whether there is a simple explanation of why you have a pre-order and not a partial order
1743680	1753440	or even a lattice as it happens in other resource theories? Not really so one thing is
1758160	1766560	so the structure of the pre-order here is very much inherent to the structure of the pre-order
1766560	1772000	for LOSR entanglement so for example in LOCC entanglement what you have is that
1772800	1779360	the conversions between states with an as the value of fee targets smaller you can actually
1779360	1787200	convert the states into a different partially entangled states. In the LOSR entanglement it's
1787200	1793760	not the case so it's already in the LOSR entanglement that you have family of incomparable resources
1794480	1802080	so for the case of assemblages this case is it just translates from the states to assemblages.
1803600	1804320	Okay thanks.
1809280	1815200	Okay there is another question or
1815200	1826640	it's not we thanks to Beata again for the talk and the people to participate.
