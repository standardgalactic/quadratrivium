1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I will speak today about a measure theoretic approach to negative probabilities.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It will be a complimentary talk to that of Acasio earlier today.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll first start setting the mathematical background and the intuitions or concepts that are behind these mathematics and then I will jump into some technicalities of the negative probability approach based on measure theory.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So suppose that you have a probabilistic system, it could be an atom to fix ideas, but it could be any other thing that you're observing.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And then you perform measurements. So this drawing here represents a particular type of measurement.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Each measurement will have or experiment at one performance will have outcomes. I wrote only three of them here but this is quite general it will be any number of different outcomes. So these are the outcomes of a particular experiment.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But when one considers the set of outcomes, one conforms an outcome set and from an outcome set one gets a Boolean algebra of events associated to that outcome set.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And a probability will be nothing but a measure satisfying Kolmogorov's options, as was explained in Jorge Hirsch's talk the other day.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So I will not go into the details because this was discussed several times in this conference, fortunately, but if you don't get any of this, you can, of the maths of this, you can think about it as a dice or a coin.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So each empirical context, so each, each concrete experiment that you perform on a system on a probabilistic system will define a set of probabilities.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And mathematically, we describe this using the notion of a measurable space, which consists of an outcome set, a Boolean algebra, and a measure that behaves pretty much like in measure theory as if it were an area as in Lebesgue.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So Sigma is a sigma algebra but what is important for us is that it is a Boolean algebra.

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So the distributive laws hold.

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:47,000
A random variable is nothing but a measurable function. If you don't have the mathematical details of a measurable function at hand, think simply about an observable in classical physics like the energy or the, or any other quantity.

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So what it is important is that with this mathematical formalism, one has a well defined probability theory that allows to compute mean values and probabilities of any event in a rigorous way.

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So this is called Mogorov theory. So each experiment keeps place to a call Mogorovian probability theory.

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I can perform other experiments. I represented this symbolically using another drawing. And there are many different types of experiments that we can perform on a probabilistic system.

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Some of them can be performed together.

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We can perform this one and this one, but some of them cannot. So, as it happens in quantum theory, we cannot measure a spin of the system in two different directions at the same time.

20
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So some experiments are jointly measurable and other experiments are not.

21
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So what one ends up in a, in a sort of matrix like this, this means that on each row of the matrix, we have experiments that can be performed together.

22
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So this one, these two can be performed together, these two can be performed together and so on. But if one mixes elements from different columns, they cannot be performed together.

23
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So this is a general situation in any empirical probabilistic theory. Quantum mechanics is just a concrete example of this.

24
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So what is important for us is that for, for each pair or shortly measurable experiments that exists a classical probability model.

25
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You can define a Kolmogorovian probability that allows me to describe the combined experiment, but you don't have a global classical probability in order to describe all possible experiments.

26
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you try to do that, you very quickly reach into contradictions or things that might not happen in the world, like for example as happens in the very inequalities.

27
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So I put this here with mathematics right this was with drawings, but now I put the same with mathematics you have random variables on each row.

28
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And notice that some experiments.

29
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
For example, this one here, the arrow can be performed with this one.

30
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But there, but the same experiment, the same empirical procedure appears in two different contexts.

31
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That is one of the most important characteristics in quantum mechanics. There are experimental procedures that are the same, but in different contexts.

32
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So, one can say that contexts or measurement contexts defined by rows.

33
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So just the ones I am showing you here.

34
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Context are intertwined. Why because they share things.

35
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So, each experiment is described by a Kolmogorovian probability space, but also each row of the matrix.

36
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:26,000
By that I mean a collection of compatible random variables that can whose experiments can be performed together will have also associated a measurable space for all the random variables that might be not that there might not exist.

37
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This is the global classical probability distribution, but notice that these random variables F11 and F14 are essentially the same, because they have the same content and are defined by the same empirical procedure.

38
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They might not be a priority identified because they belong to different contexts, and this is very important in statistics because it might lead to two problems if one don't have, if you don't have that into account.

39
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So, one has some observables that belong to different contexts.

40
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What is the status of the observables that have the same content, but belong to different contexts. Well, in principle, one could try to identify them to put an equal sign between them.

41
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is very usual in physics. Why, because the marginals, even if they belong to different contexts, the marginal are the same.

42
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Given that they are the same, you can identify them and not having too much trouble.

43
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Notice that this is the no signal condition. The marginal probability for this will not depend on the context.

44
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But some authors say that they are different, because this is a natural assumption in statistics, because in general, in a general probabilistic theory, this might be signal.

45
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So the marginals, the probabilities associated to this particular experiment could be different.

46
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Unfortunately, it doesn't happen in quantum theory.

47
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
With Acasio de Barros and Decio Krause, we propose to consider them as indistinguishable.

48
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And we combine this notion with the mathematical formalism of quasi set theory.

49
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But usually an identification takes place. So one, one, so one can see that contexts are intertwined.

50
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:39,000
C1 cannot be performed at the same time with C2. If one chooses to perform experiment C1, one cannot perform experiment C2.

51
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So a state, a quantum state will give us a collection of classical probabilities, one for each context.

52
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But we know that contexts are intertwined. So we have quantum observables, maximally compatible quantum observables define context.

53
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So one has an injection here, a kind of embedding of Boolean algebras. This is a Boolean algebras, and this guy here is a Boolean algebras too.

54
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And for Boolean algebras, we have classical probabilities. For each observable, a classical probability, and for each context, a classical probability.

55
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But the thing is that given that contexts are intertwined, this is not the end of the story.

56
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So we know that there is a mathematical object that contains the information about all possible contexts.

57
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This is the lattice of projection operators of the Hilbert space. So a quantum state is not a classical probability, but it is a measure on the non Boolean lattice of projection operators acting on the Hilbert space.

58
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And the glissons theorem makes this diagram commutative.

59
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Why?

60
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,000
In quantum mechanics, as I said, we have a global object that contains the information about all the contexts and correlations.

61
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It is very useful in practice. If we will only stay in the classical description, it will be very difficult to deal with quantum phenomena.

62
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The great step forward of quantum physics is to build a non commutative probability calculus that allows us to give a unified description for all possible measurement contexts.

63
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The story will not end up there because we know that there is more, the projections are elements of a ring of operators, and due to glissons theorem, all these diagram commutes.

64
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So there are at least two ways of describing global states, an object like this, this guy here is a measure, and this guy here is a density operator, but remember that they are the same because of glissons theorem.

65
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The first alternative is the one just described, to paste Boolean algebras and end up in a non Boolean structure and define states as usual in quantum mechanics or in quantum logics.

66
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:28,000
One can speak about automodular lattices or partial Boolean algebras, but the second alternative, and it is very important in physics, I will explain why in a minute, is to keep using Boolean algebras and create here a Boolean algebra, but allowing this measure to be negative.

67
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This is a move that is very important in quantum physics.

68
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Why negative probabilities are so important in physics. Well, they have a long tradition in the history of physics. Everyone knows the beginner quasi probability distribution and its applications.

69
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And Iraq also studied them in the context of energy, for example, he says negative energies and probabilities should not be considered as nonsense they are well defined concepts mathematically like a negative money, and also Feynman tried to dig into the mysteries of negative probability he says trying to think of negative probabilities gave me a cool cultural shock at first.

70
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And when I finally go easy with the concept, I wrote myself a note so I wouldn't forget so.

71
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So it the lesson says, well, there's a video of Peter shore explaining that he attended to a lecture by Feynman, and he was thinking that allowing negative probabilities would allow to understand the EPR paradox, and of course he was right to a great extent.

72
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So, but the most important thing for us is that many relevant applications in quantum optics, quantum contextuality and quantum information theory, rely on dealing with negative probability.

73
00:12:47,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So, even if you like it or not, if you're a practicing physicist is very likely that you find yourself working on negative probabilities or trying to read a paper that deals with negative probabilities because they are a very useful practical tool.

74
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So, now I will turn into a joint work with Professor Acasio de Barrios from the San Francisco State University about negative probabilities.

75
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let me explain the motivations first. We started to work on contextuality and we were wondering what will be a general definition of negative probability.

76
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Of course, there are many in the literature, but we wonder whether it was possible to give a definition which is based solely on measure theory, as in Kolmogorov's actions.

77
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So we wanted the, the negative probability version of Kolmogorov theory, is that possible. And importantly, we wanted it to be independent of any Hilbert space structure.

78
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So we don't want to rely in the quantum formalism. Another question was how to incorporate the notion of context from the very beginning. This is very important, the notion of contextuality.

79
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And the other question was to study connections between indistinguishability and negative probabilities.

80
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So, the details can be found here in this publication is from the last year.

81
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But now I'll give some some idea of the definition and its technical properties.

82
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The simple move will be instead of using Kolmogorov's actions to use just a sign measure, which is the same as Kolmogorov, but one allows this measure to take negative values.

83
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Now we don't put the evaluation into the zero one interval, but we allow all possible real numbers. This is, so this triplet here will be called a sign measure space.

84
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But of course, there's a problem here because in quantum mechanics, we need contexts.

85
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Where are contexts in this definition, they are not included. So, we need to find, we needed to find a definition that incorporates from the very beginning, the possibility of having measurement contexts.

86
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So one, one way that we found was starting with a sign measure space, define the notion of an extended random variable, which is the same, pretty the same as a random variable, but now define over the sign space.

87
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So now the pre image of every open interval or everybody said will be just a measurable set associated to the space but the measure could be negative up to now.

88
00:15:45,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This is very usual, but now it comes to the idea that I think that changes the setting because what we do is to consider a family, a collection of extended random variables defined on a family of signed probability models.

89
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What we say is that the general context will be a subset of this family. So a context will be a collection of random variables.

90
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Such that there exists a sub sigma algebra of the algebra associated to this family of of of sign probability models in such a way that when the probabilities are restricted to the sub sigma algebra, they are classical.

91
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So, for all F for all event in this sub sigma algebra this try and becomes a classical probability space and the random variables of that context are classical random variables with regard to that measurement context.

92
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So, let me put now an example suppose that we have three random variables, and the three of them are not compatible so you cannot perform an experiment in which the three of them are measured together.

93
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So, you can measure X and Y, Y and Z and X and Z, but not the three of them at the same time. So what you have is for each pair for example X and Y, you will have a classical probability space for Y and Z a classical probability space depicted here in red and for X and Z.

94
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Another classical probability space depicted in green, but the whole thing is embedded in a Boolean algebra.

95
00:17:43,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Sigma. So this Sigma one is a is a sub algebra of Sigma Sigma two and Sigma three they are sub algebras and Omega is the same. And this is done in such a way that when move the global measure when restricted to the black circle here is a classical probability

96
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and coincides with P1 and the same move restricted to the red circle coincides with P3 and so on.

97
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But move is not necessarily positive, it might take negative values. So this allows us to describe

98
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:33,000
probabilities and surprisingly it includes many physical examples of interest like the beginner transform can be described in this way.

99
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But this way is not dependent on the Hilbert space formalism, of course, and also the value inequalities and many other examples. So with this definition, we think that we capture the notion of

100
00:18:46,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the contextuality of having contexts that are not necessarily compatible between them, but with the global noel shape that might take a negative values.

101
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Assigned probability space, also called the negative probability will be assigned measure space and do it with a non empty set of context in the sense of the previous definition.

102
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The measure will be assigned probability or a negative probability.

103
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:28,000
This is for example, what happens, I showed you here for example, X and Y, how to build a Boolean algebra for the two of them.

104
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So this is how the Boolean algebra looks like, and the probability assigned to them will be a measure defined here, as in measure theory.

105
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And of course one can go on and add more variables X Y set and create a Boolean algebra. So our algorithm, what it does is to compute first a global Boolean algebra for all the random variables, even if they are not compatible.

106
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But then, in that global Boolean algebra, we define a measure which might take negative values.

107
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So how would that work for the three random variables? Well, one ends up in a family of equations, these are linear equations. The inputs are the mean values of the random variables.

108
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:30,000
One has for example, the mean values of single random variables, and here one must solve these equations for the piece, the piece are the probabilities associated to the elementary events.

109
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
One also can consider mean values of products of random variables and so on.

110
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Depending on how much information one inputs into this system, one might have one solution, many or none, it depends.

111
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But the thing is that one ends up in a linear system and using the input one can solve this linear system and find all possible negative probabilities that are compatible with the input statistics.

112
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So this is how our general definition describes families of non-compatible random variables. But there's something important. In this definition,

113
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:31,000
we are using measure theory. So there is no restriction to finite models. I am explaining things using a finite model, but with the atomic random variables, but this is not restricted to finite sets.

114
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So it is pretty much a single model of theory. So you have a very nice measure theory going on.

115
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So I'm just about to end. So what are the advantages? Well, the advantages of this approach, it can be used to define contextuality measures.

116
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So this is done by quantifying how negative is your state. And it includes previous examples of non-signal models as particular cases.

117
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So the probabilities never appear in experiments. Only concrete contexts represent what actually happens.

118
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And it is possible also to define an entropic measure in the usual way.

119
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So this is the usual way in quantum logic. You just take sort of convex roots on all possible measurement contexts.

120
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And how will that be in the in the very inequalities? Well, Jorge Hirsch was talking about this the other day, not so explicit about negative probabilities, but he described how to build a hidden variable model for a bell type scenario.

121
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So if one proceeds that way, one ends in a Boolean algebra, as in bell, and a classical probability. Well, of course, bell stops because he cannot go on.

122
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:01,000
He says, well, it doesn't exist. It leads to a contradiction. Of course, of course, because quantum mechanics cannot be described by the global classical probability measure.

123
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But if you allow for negative probabilities, and this was a clear intuition of Feynman, so you can find a solution. You will get a lot of equations. These are linear equations.

124
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:32,000
They look bad, but this is very simple. And you find that actually a singlet state will be described by the negative probability. So we have a general universal framework for dealing with negative probabilities that includes, as far as we know,

125
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:43,000
the most example examples of interest, and it is based on measure theory, a single model of theory, but it is an extension that allows to describe contextual theories.

126
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So, it seems to us that to understand contextuality is deeply related to understand how contexts are intertwined.

127
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And how global states and even algebra emerge. The identification of random variables among different contexts seem to play a key role in their genesis.

128
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
There seems to be an indistinguishably indistinguishability principle at play. Why?

129
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Let me come back to this slide here. In order to build a global boonial algebra, I have to assume that this random variable x is the same when I consider it in context y, x, y, and it's the same when I consider it in context x set, and so on for y and set.

130
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That is very important. So I have to identify random variables that have the same content but belong to different and incompatible contexts.

131
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So we have discussed the general features of a measure theoretical approach for describing quantum states, and our approach makes boonial algebras and allows for negative probabilities.

132
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:11,000
If you are interested in this approach, you can go to some of our previous papers, especially this one last year, and I thank you for your attention. That's all.

133
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Okay, thank you for your talk.

134
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:31,000
If there are questions, you can express it in the chat and give you the word. It is a question from Allison testing.

135
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Hi.

136
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So, can you hear me?

137
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yes.

138
00:25:38,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay, so thanks for the talk. And when you discussed quantum predictions from this perspective, do you take into account the spectrum of operators, or do you assume that outcomes, the value doesn't matter?

139
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Let me see if I understand your question. I'm just, when I speak about projection operators, I just speak about the usual thing that you do in quantum mechanics.

140
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Quantum mechanics observables are represented by self-adjoint operators.

141
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
In the finite dimensional case, they are Hermitian.

142
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And of course, a particular subfamily of the Hermitian operators or self-adjoint in the infinite dimensional case are the projection operators.

143
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So it turns out that these mathematical entities have a very precise structure which is that they form a lattice.

144
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So with projection operators, you mean the physical interpretation of what you mean?

145
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
No.

146
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
If I understood it correctly, you represent measurements as random variables, correct?

147
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Ah, yeah, I understand. Now I see your question. Now I see. Now I see. But let me explain you something that might make it very clear.

148
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Look, let us start the other way around, because I went from the basics to the most complicated. But suppose that you assume quantum mechanics, standard quantum mechanics.

149
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Okay, then you have a ring of operators. That's trivial, right?

150
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Okay, so now you have a density operator that gives probabilities for all observables here, right?

151
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So it turns out that if you restrict to elementary tests, like yes, no questions.

152
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Like for example, is the photon inside this box or not? So you represent that by a projection operator.

153
00:27:49,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But each context, each context, so each time you have a family, a maximum family of compatible observables,

154
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
if you look at the projection operators associated to that family, they form a Hullian algebra.

155
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Do you agree? Okay. So that's elementary. So then these are the Hullian algebras here in this round.

156
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But these Hullian algebras are subalgebras of an algebra which is non-Bullian.

157
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So each quantum state, when restricted to one of these Hullian algebras, defines a classical probability model.

158
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
This is why you can perform experiments, otherwise you wouldn't be able to do nothing in an laboratory.

159
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And you do experiment, and you just consider a family of compatible observables, you will have a classical probability.

160
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But the whole thing is not classical because there is no joint global probability distribution for all the possible contexts.

161
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But notice the move that we do here. This is standard physics.

162
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
This is what every physicist do. But also physicists do this.

163
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So what you can do is not to create the quantum logic. Don't do that. Don't go into the ring of operators, but go into the Wigner transform.

164
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,000
For example, when you have the Wigner function, you transform the observable and you have P and Q in the same space.

165
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You have a phase space and a negative probability in that space.

166
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
This is another way of representing quantum mechanics and quantum states, which turns out to be equivalent. That's very interesting.

167
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So what we do here is to get independent, we get independence of the Hilbert space formalism, and we give a general measure theoretic definition of probability that allows contexts,

168
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
allows also the probabilities to take negative values.

169
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And when you restrict to the well-known examples, you will get, yes, the usual, the Wigner distribution. That's the idea.

170
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Okay, and can I ask you one more question?

171
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't know. Ask Sebastiano. I don't know if we have time.

172
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
There are two more questions.

173
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I can wait.

174
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You can surely send me an email, Alison. No problem. We can keep, yes.

175
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Okay.

176
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Discussing after that one.

177
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Yes, yes.

178
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Thank you.

179
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Thank you. Thank Federico for the talk.

180
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Every time I hear you again, I understand a little bit more of the kind of proposal that you have in mind.

181
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Okay, so I was just curious if we can go back to the last part of your talk where you were making reference to Bell's theorem and the problem with how he assumed how the distributions worked.

182
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So here's the thing.

183
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You attribute the problem to the idea that he is somehow assuming classical probability, right?

184
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's one of the problems. There are many problems, right?

185
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
One of them is he assumes classical probability. It's not a problem. It's an assumption.

186
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Perhaps that's the answer to my question. But my question was this.

187
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It seems that what you're denying basically is the idea that you can have the same distribution over the lambdas, irrespectively of how Bob and Alice measure.

188
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Is that correct? You are basically denying the assumption of settings independence.

189
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Well, no, because if you allow them to be negative, you can have the same.

190
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You see what I mean? That's what I'm saying, right?

191
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Okay, that's what I'm saying.

192
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm telling you that one of the key assumptions, and this was, well, this was even, you can look it on YouTube, for example.

193
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's very nice how Peter Shore tells about it.

194
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
He says that he attended to lecture by Feynman, and Feynman said that.

195
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I mean, one of the main problems is that you're assuming a classical probability, and there are many ways of assuming a classical probability.

196
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I mean, there are many, sorry, there are many different ways of not having a classical probability.

197
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So Bell assumes a classical probability, correct.

198
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So one might say, well, what are the assumptions that are wrong?

199
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
One possibility could be, well, the world is not local.

200
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I think some people believe that there are hidden variables and that the world is not local.

201
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's a very good reasoning.

202
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It might be, but it might be that using positive probabilities is not the best.

203
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I mean, what justifies conmodal obsessions?

204
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,000
That's a very deep discussion, not in quantum physics, in the foundations of probability theory, and it was never easy at all.

205
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
What are the right rules for probability?

206
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So it is presented sometimes as a mild assumption, but if you know about this, it is not.

207
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I think it is not. I mean, you cannot present it as a mild assumption. That's what I think.

208
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So one way to play is to go into negative probabilities. Of course, some other people will say no, not going to negative, just use non-commutative probability theory.

209
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That could be also.

210
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Okay, perhaps we can talk in another moment, but my suspicion is going to be that in the end what is really happening, but it's really, really, really the cost of the problem is the idea that you are writing the distribution of lambda independently of the settings of A and B.

211
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yes, but well, that's one of the things, right, in, yes, but you can, what I'm telling you is that you can do that, you can actually do that, and allow the probabilities to be negative, and then you will not derive inequalities.

212
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:42,000
No, but the thing is that you don't need to talk about negative probabilities. You can stop with saying that the distribution of lambda depends on what is going to be measured by Alice and Bob, and you can stop the theorem.

213
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The theorem doesn't go.

214
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Yeah, I know. That's the usual way to deal with the problem, right? That will say, I mean, an orthodox quantum physics will say, well, it's not the classical probability calculus.

215
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Stop assigning values to things that are not measured, stop mixing results from different contexts and assigning global probabilities, because this is what we know from the very beginning of quantum mechanics.

216
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Which, if you don't say anything else, that is a mystery, right, because it is.

217
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Why would you say that discussion.

218
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So, some minutes for the last question from Benny Diggs.

219
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Thank you, Federico.

220
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I found that a very interesting, even exciting talk.

221
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Thanks.

222
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm still shocked by the negative probabilities.

223
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So I can understand that you have a mathematical scheme here in which the negative values of the measure occur and that that makes it possible to combine all these different contexts.

224
00:35:47,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I would, I myself would object to using the word probability for the negative measures, if you combine these contexts, because probabilities have to have I have to interpret main interpretations.

225
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
One is relative frequencies.

226
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And the other is a measure of belief, the credence you can attach to a certain proposition, and neither of them applies to this negative probability.

227
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So it, in my opinion, these negative probabilities do not qualify as probabilities, they are just mathematical quantities that are signed measures.

228
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I agree with that.

229
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But I feel and that links to the comments you made on one of the previous question, I think there are very good reasons for the common core of axioms, and especially for the for the axiom that the probability should between zero and one.

230
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So to cut things short, my question is why do you insist on on calling these negative values probabilities.

231
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
If for me it's it's obvious they are not probabilities.

232
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Okay, good question. Thanks. Thanks, Dennis.

233
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Now let me clarify things because there are there are several problems here. One is the interpretation of negative probabilities, which have scored, of course, in is problematic.

234
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:25,000
In this case, it's not so problematic, because we don't claim that you will measure negative probabilities will we will never ever measure a negative probability that's nonsense, you will not.

235
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:40,000
What you will have is context, you have a very clear here in this definition, a very clear mathematical definition in the sense of called more of of mathematical of of measurement context.

236
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:51,000
This is independent of quantum theory that's what I why I like this. So, on each measurement context, you will have classical probability and that's what you observe in the laboratory.

237
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But at the same time, it is reasonable to call you can call it instead of negative probability or sign probability or, I don't know, you can call it the way you want.

238
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:17,000
The interesting point is that this is a natural mathematically is a very natural extension of Kolmogorov theory that incorporates the notion of context from the very beginning as a mathematical concept.

239
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That is very important for me. And let me tell you why you know that negative probabilities, even if you don't want to use them as a as a nice interpretation that are very useful in quantum optics.

240
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I mean, you, you end up dealing either way or the other with negative probabilities in physics, especially in quantum information.

241
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And especially if you want to study contextuality, because usually you want to look at the properties of quantum states.

242
00:38:48,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And one way of studying contextuality is to look at the beginner distribution and see how negative it is with regard to a family of observables, for example, or for example, classicality.

243
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:13,000
If you want to study if your system reaches the classical limit or not, a very usual tool is to look at the, how, how negative is the, the, the beginner distribution.

244
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So we think that with this definition, we can give the other definitions of contextuality that can be useful in practice to understand better for example why quantum computers have a speed up.

245
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Now we are working with Elisa Monkietti, she's starting her master thesis and we try to apply these mathematical tools to study problems in quantum information.

246
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That's the goal.

247
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It's really difficult to, to escape from that because you cannot tell a guy from quantum optics. No, don't use, don't use quasi probabilities, don't use the beginner distribution.

248
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:12,000
No, people will will continue using it, even, I mean, so, so with this work, we are not claiming that you should replace standard quantum probability by negative probability.

249
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So, but we think that this approach will give us at the technical level clues to understand better a quantum context.

250
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That's what we think.

251
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay, thank you.

252
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Thanks.

253
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Thank you for your talk and for the people who participate, making questions and comments.
