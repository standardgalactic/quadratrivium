0	1960	Perfecto.
1960	6720	Welcome, everyone, to the third, to the fourth day
6720	10320	of the 10 Conference of Quantum Foundations.
10320	15120	We are glad to start this morning's session with Professor
15120	18400	Marta Reboido from the Department of Physics
18400	21680	of the University of La Plata and the Institute of Physics
21680	24720	of La Plata-Ponisette.
24720	27080	She will speak about exceptional points
27080	30600	from a hybrid physical system.
30600	32880	Please, go on, Marta.
32880	36120	OK, good morning to everybody.
36120	39280	First of all, I want to thank the organizers
39280	42840	for letting us share our work in this nice and interesting
42840	45280	conference on Quantum Foundations.
45280	47960	This work has been done in collaboration
47960	50160	with Romina Ram√≠rez and Diego Tielas
50160	53320	from the University of La Plata.
53320	57000	The focus of my talk is the existence
57000	63600	of a sectional point in hybrid physical systems.
63600	66520	I shall highlight some connections
66520	70680	to the time evolution of the given initial prepared state
70680	79400	and, in particular, its behavior at long intervals of time.
79400	83520	Hybrid models are a system consisting
83520	86520	of two or more components intended
86520	92280	to harness the advantages and strengths of each of these
92280	94680	components.
94680	99000	As an example, we can think of the model proposed
99000	103280	10 years ago by Sue et al.
103280	106840	Consistent of a superconductive flux
106840	112800	COVID coupled to a system of MBs, a nitrogen vacancy
112800	128800	in diamon, this is interesting because the superconductive
128800	134200	flux COVID can be used to model the two-level systems
134200	140520	and to make COVID operations and due to the long time
140560	145000	coherence time of the MBs, the MBs can be used
145000	148360	as a memory of the system.
148360	150680	Here is the experimental device.
150680	157160	This is the diamon sample.
157160	162400	And here on the top is the superconductive circuit.
162400	164280	From the theoretical point of view,
164280	168960	this hybrid model can be represented
168960	174400	by Hamiltonian consisting of three terms, a COVID term,
174400	178440	a term associated with the nitrogen vacancy system
178440	182000	and interaction term.
182000	184680	The superconductive flux COVID consists
184680	187800	of an aluminum superconductive loop
187800	193480	with three chasps on junctions and a magnetic field.
193480	197880	And when the magnetic field is applied through the loop,
197880	201400	the system can be modeled by a two-level Hamiltonian,
201400	208920	where E is the energy bias, delta is the tunneling splitting,
208920	214280	X, the operator S are related.
214280	217360	Here should be, et cetera, the operator S
217360	224400	is related to the half-poly matrices.
224440	227720	And through a suitable transformation,
227720	232520	it can be mapped to, it can be generalized.
232520	237280	And the energies of the system are given in terms
237280	245360	of the energy bias and the gap tunnel split.
245360	250960	The nitrogen vacancy center is defect in the lattice,
250960	254080	in the diamon, in the lattice of the diamon,
254080	258600	where a carbon atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom,
258600	263000	and its neighbor is a vacancy.
263000	267640	This system can be modeled by the ground state of the system,
267640	270320	is a triplet.
270320	274120	When there is no external magnetic field applied,
274120	279040	the two excited states of the template are degenerate
279040	281840	and separated from the ground state
281840	290040	an energy of 2.88 GHz.
290040	296440	This separation energy makes this system adequate to be
296440	302920	coupled to the superconductive class COVID.
302920	306280	The interaction time is usually taken
306280	322000	as the component set of the spin of the COVID
322000	327480	times the x component of the spin of the MVs.
327480	335360	We have modified the x component of the spins
335360	342120	to take into account the effect of other impurities
342120	343640	in the diamon.
343640	349760	The more relevant are neutral nitrogen vacancy centers
349760	357600	called P1 centers, which are responsible for the loss
357600	360920	of coherence of the MVs.
360920	365400	So we have introduced this term that is non-admission.
365400	368800	If the interaction is not present
368800	373360	and we take a system of two MVs, we
373360	381600	have the two levels of the COVIDs and three levels
381600	385480	for the quality coupling of the two MVs.
385480	388120	When the interaction term is turned on,
388120	392120	there is a splitting of the levels.
392120	396960	And due to the fact that this term is non-admission,
396960	399920	sign of the level can acquire a wheel.
399920	406400	That is, the eigenvalues of the system can be complex.
406400	409680	To understand the spectrum of the system,
409720	417720	we can see that the adjoined Hamiltonian
417720	421680	is the transpose of H. That means
421680	427120	that this both Hamiltonian and this spectral operators
427120	429840	and, in consequence, the eigenvalues are
429840	436040	other real or complex conflict pairs.
436040	444280	The basis can be leveled by the states of the COVIDs
444280	450120	and the collective states of the MVs.
450120	453920	If we let us first describe what happens
453920	457960	with the system of one superconductive blue cube,
457960	461680	COVID coupled to two MVs.
461680	465720	These are the typical constants of the sector
466400	469960	of the MVs and we shall assume that the tunneling
469960	472760	splitting of the superconductive blue cube
472760	476880	can be set at the value of 2D.
476880	481040	And this a dimensional coupling is
481040	487040	the strength of the interaction in terms of the coupling E.
487040	491320	If we plot the eigenvalues in terms
491320	494320	of this a dimensional coupling and in terms
494320	500640	of the asymmetric parameter, we realize that there is a sector
500640	505440	in the parameter model space where the eigenvalues
505440	510240	are complex configurations.
510240	516080	This limiting curve is the curve where
516080	518520	exceptional points occurs.
518520	524280	An essential point is a point in the parameter model
524280	530280	space where the eigenvalues are coalescent
530280	532680	and also the eigenfunctions.
532680	536760	That is, the matrix of the system is no longer
536760	540880	the diagonalizable.
540880	548000	This pattern that I have plot before for the case of delta
548000	558360	equal 2D, this small d equals 0, is this line up here.
558360	565240	And if we now vary the value of delta over d,
565240	567760	we found that there is a regular pattern
567760	569880	for exceptional points in the system.
573280	576560	To look at the time evolution of the system,
576560	580840	we shall use the formalities of the green function.
580840	583280	If we have the Hamiltonian, the green matter
583280	586480	is related to the Hamiltonian in this way.
586480	590680	And the time evolution of the system
590680	595320	can be expressed in terms of the Fourier transform
595320	599480	of the green matrix.
599480	602640	The transition matrix shall be defined in terms
602640	605520	of the Fourier transform in this way
605560	612400	and give us the information of the transition
612400	615280	between these states as a function of time.
619920	627960	Here I have fixed the value of g to 0.02 GHz.
627960	636240	And then this is the typical plot for an exceptional point
636240	637960	in this region.
637960	639560	The energy is real.
639560	644560	In this region and this region, the energy is complicated.
644560	649200	If we look at the transition probability,
649200	655040	that is the entries of the matrix that I have defined before,
655080	661120	for a long interval of time, in terms of alpha,
661120	664080	we see that the transition probabilities of sun
664080	671920	states tend to value different from 0
671920	677520	at the time for long interval times.
677520	684680	This is of diagonal terms and this is the diagonal terms.
684680	690720	And in this region where the spectrum is real,
690720	695720	here we have performed a promedius.
695720	703800	We have promedied on two period times the results.
703800	709080	This is where the spectrum is complex.
709080	714280	This is the steady value of the probability.
717520	721040	Well, what is interesting is what happened at this point
721040	723480	where the eigenvalue of coalesce.
723480	730040	As I have said before, for these points,
730040	739880	we observe non-exponential k because the matrix related
739880	749320	to the transform of the dream function
749320	754000	has a block which corresponds to a Schoeman form
754000	756000	because the Hamiltonian at this point
756000	759400	is no longer diagonalizable.
759400	766120	And then the consequence of this is that the decay is no longer
766120	775320	exponential but we have some potential of t in the spectrum.
775320	785720	If we study the survival probability for a coherent state,
785720	790040	for an initial state, prepare as a coherent state
790040	800120	with azimuthal axis p over 4 times the system of the qubits
800120	807560	in the ground state, we see that the probability,
807560	813320	survival probability, can be written in an analytical form
813320	815720	this way.
815720	824600	We observe that we have a factor t square in the numerator
824600	829320	and denominator so that, as a function of time,
829320	831640	this will evolve to a constant.
832360	846920	For a given initial state, prepare as an initial state
846920	851960	of the qubits and initial state of the mbis,
851960	858440	the evolved state is given in this way.
858440	861080	And as I have said before, the probability,
861080	866680	survival probability has this expression as usual.
866680	871880	And here we show four different values of alpha,
871880	874000	not the exceptional point.
874000	877800	The exceptional point is this and this.
877800	884880	How the probability behaves for a long interval of time
884880	887200	as a function of time.
887200	892720	We see that depending on theta, this corresponds to theta
892720	899120	equals 0, p over 2, p over 4, and p,
899120	904200	the survival probability of the initial state
904200	914280	is close to 1 near the exceptional point or goes to 0.
914280	918720	And the opposed behavior in the other exceptional point.
918720	925920	In this branch of parameters where the values are real,
925920	931480	these are the promedio in two periods of time.
934840	938000	What we learn from this is that depending
938000	941160	on the initial state, the survival probability in terms
941160	948160	of the coupling of the asymmetric parameter
948160	953120	is better or not.
953120	958280	Well, let us look at the squeezing parameter.
958280	962280	The squeezing parameter is defined
962320	971880	as if we have a system of spins, that is, then this,
971880	975960	for instance, and we look at the mean value of the spin
975960	980360	and define this as the set up prime direction.
980360	985520	Then we look in the perpendicular plane to this direction
985520	999120	where for the small component of the deviation of x prime,
999120	1003960	that define the parameter of the squeezing of the system.
1003960	1009800	And if this is reduced in the direction of x prime,
1009840	1018000	sorry, this is because in the perpendicular direction,
1018000	1020480	it is increased.
1020480	1023560	When we look at this parameter, we
1023560	1029560	observe that for the real regime of the spectrum,
1029560	1034680	when the spectrum is real, the system can be squeezed.
1034680	1042720	But for the points where the spectrum is complex,
1042720	1045440	the system is anti-squix.
1045440	1050160	In particular, there is a point here
1050160	1055280	where the mean value of the spins adopt the value 0.
1055280	1058760	And for this point here, of course,
1058760	1062720	this parameter diverge.
1062720	1067560	And perhaps it is not well defined at this point.
1067560	1074200	But for this particular point, we observe the following thing.
1074200	1079600	We observe that if we have an initial state prepared
1079600	1086680	as a coherent state for instance with theta equal p over 2,
1086720	1094040	it evolves in time to this particular state, which
1094040	1100000	is composed of the superposition of two coherent states.
1103600	1109160	This state was identified as a reading
1109160	1117120	at the state by other workers sometime ago.
1117120	1125640	So what happened is that if we prepare an initial state,
1125640	1134760	in this particular cap and I will be particular asymmetry
1134760	1140760	in the state, the capital interaction,
1140760	1149760	will end with a reading circuit.
1149760	1155320	These are the plot obtained by computing the beginner
1155320	1159920	discrete function for the ease U2 model.
1160920	1167920	Then we can think what happens is we compute this
1167920	1171920	for a larger number of nb's.
1171920	1177920	For two nb's, we have, for instance,
1177920	1184920	if we value delta equal 2 times d,
1185920	1194920	this curve will correspond to the appearance
1194920	1196920	of the sectional point.
1196920	1202920	And this curve will correspond to the appearance of cad
1202920	1209920	states as steady states of the system.
1210920	1217920	When we increase the number of nb's in the system
1217920	1225920	and we redefine the parameter alpha as alpha over
1225920	1229920	square root of m, this is a collective model.
1229920	1238920	That's why the alpha should be rewritten
1238920	1242920	as alpha over square root of m.
1242920	1252920	We also found a regular pattern of exceptional points
1252920	1256920	and a regular pattern of a reading curve
1256920	1262920	cad states as steady states.
1262920	1266920	Well, in conclusion, we have shown
1266920	1269920	that in this type of hybrid systems,
1269920	1275920	we can show the appearance of exceptional points.
1275920	1282920	This is an aspect related to the non-hormitian
1282920	1287920	dynamic of the system.
1287920	1293920	Non-exceptional, at non, at exceptional points,
1293920	1300920	we love the exponential decay.
1300920	1304920	The states, which are no, the matrix,
1304920	1309920	which is no longer diagonalizable,
1309920	1314920	admit a normal short-term form,
1314920	1319920	and then the survivor probability related
1319920	1323920	to an initially even state at this point
1323920	1328920	will show a polynomial behavior.
1328920	1332920	The order of the polynomial corresponds to the
1332920	1338920	order of the pole in the green matrix
1338920	1341920	at the exceptional point.
1341920	1347920	And we also show that in this type of systems,
1347920	1358920	we can create as steady states a reading curve.
1358920	1364920	If we now couple the system of m best
1364920	1368920	to more superconducting COVID,
1368920	1377920	we can expect that the structure
1377920	1380920	or the coexistence of exceptional points
1380920	1383920	will show a more rich behavior,
1383920	1386920	and perhaps we have exceptional points
1386920	1391920	of not only one pair of state coalescing
1391920	1393920	to the same eigenstate,
1393920	1397920	but more eigenstate coalescing to the same states.
1397920	1400920	And what is an open question,
1400920	1405920	there is some people working on this,
1405920	1409920	is what happened with non-ormition systems
1409920	1412920	at finite temperature.
1412920	1417920	We have recently begun to work on this work,
1417920	1423920	but I hope next year we can give some insight on this.
1423920	1432920	Well, thank you very much for your attention.
1432920	1435920	Thanks.
1435920	1438920	Thanks Marta, thanks for this great talk.
1438920	1440920	Now, if there are some questions,
1440920	1443920	please write them down in the chat
1443920	1450920	and I will pick them up.
1450920	1453920	Sebastian, please go ahead.
1453920	1457920	You can open your mic if you want.
1457920	1461920	Hello Marta, thank you for your talk.
1461920	1464920	I think that I know what you think,
1464920	1468920	but I want to hear from you.
1468920	1474920	Do you have some interpretation
1474920	1476920	or conceptual interpretation
1476920	1482920	of the meaning of the imaginary part of the energy?
1482920	1486920	And the second part of the question is,
1486920	1491920	in this formalism,
1491920	1496920	change the interpretation of the energy
1496920	1502920	that we know even in the real part of the energy
1502920	1507920	or not is the same.
1507920	1512920	What I have learned till now is that
1512920	1517920	in generally the parameters
1517920	1522920	leading to real spectrum,
1522920	1524920	when you have real spectrum,
1524920	1528920	generally you can make a similarly transformation
1528920	1530920	to an Hermitian Hamiltonian,
1530920	1535920	which is at a system with finite number of degrees,
1535920	1538920	with finite dimension.
1538920	1543920	So the part of real spectrum,
1543920	1546920	I think that is almost the same
1546920	1548920	as the Hermitian Hamiltonian
1548920	1552920	through a similar transformation.
1552920	1558920	The other sector of the model,
1558920	1563920	is complex energies.
1563920	1566920	Well, in finite systems,
1566920	1571920	I will think of the usual concept of loss and gain,
1571920	1574920	and you say, well,
1574920	1579920	the eigenvalues have a negative part of the energy,
1579920	1581920	of the complex energy,
1581920	1587920	you are modeling a loss system,
1587920	1593920	and if you in some way can add things to the system,
1593920	1600920	then you have to have the positive part of the energy,
1600920	1603920	of the complex energy.
1603920	1606920	That is for finite systems.
1606920	1609920	And this was nice.
1609920	1611920	There are a lot of experiments,
1611920	1616920	particularly in optical physics.
1616920	1620920	I can give you some recent results,
1620920	1624920	by mail, the reference.
1624920	1633920	Now, the problem is with infinite dimensional systems.
1633920	1638920	There we have worked out the model,
1638920	1641920	I don't know if you are familiar,
1641920	1643920	the model of Swanson,
1643920	1649920	the simple model that has is a quadratic model of Bosons,
1649920	1652920	and once after interaction,
1652920	1657920	it has an stress different than the other.
1657920	1661920	And it has a broken symmetric space
1661920	1666920	that has complex parent values.
1666920	1672920	And we have learned that with proper choice
1672920	1677920	of the parameters and with adequate transformation,
1677920	1683920	we can also make
1683920	1688920	some relation between the Hamiltonian is a joint.
1688920	1692920	But now the eigenvalues, the eigenfunctions,
1692920	1694920	does not belong to the Hilbert space,
1694920	1697920	because they are not square integrals.
1697920	1703920	So you have to use the formalings of the Elphan template.
1703920	1709920	And then, when you look at the time evolution in this case,
1709920	1711920	you have to be carefully,
1711920	1713920	you have to do it carefully,
1713920	1718920	because it is not a resonant and anti-resonant state
1718920	1724920	as stated the other day, Manuel Gadella.
1724920	1728920	They are, the time rebels are one of the other,
1728920	1733920	and then you have to make the evolution with the resonant states
1733920	1738920	for T greater than zero
1738920	1745920	and with the anti-resonant state with T less than zero.
1745920	1750920	And it is, as Manuel said,
1750920	1757920	it is tricky because you have to deal with,
1757920	1763920	sometimes with metric operation that with similar operators
1763920	1766920	that are not definitely positive define,
1766920	1772920	and so you have to look at the metric and so on.
1772920	1776920	There is still too much to do.
1776920	1781920	A lot of things to do.
1781920	1784920	Okay. Thank you, Martin.
1784920	1787920	Okay. We are on time.
1787920	1790920	So we thank Marta for this great talk.
1790920	1793920	So we put some internet claps.
