1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Okay. Okay, welcome to the second part of the conference of this day. The first talk of this

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:17,200
session is in charge of Michael Jensen from the University of Minnesota. The title of the talk is

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,880
quantum kinematics. A new framework for handling probabilities. Go on, Michael.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,360
Okay. Thank you very much for the invitation. Everybody can see my screen. I hope you had

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,000
a chance to read my abstract. So what I'll be doing for the most part is to talk about the

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,920
correlations you can get with the proverbial Alice and Bob performing measurements on two spin half

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,280
particles entangled in the singlet state. And I'll represent the class of correlations that you can

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,800
get in that kind of, like I should say, in a setup that was suggested by David Merman,

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,160
where Alice and Bob both choose from the same three observables that they're going to measure.

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,000
And I'm going to be looking at the kind of correlations that are allowed in that setup,

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,880
if you just restrict it to like anything that's non-signaling, anything that can be

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,520
done quantum mechanically, and anything that can be done like with local hidden variable theories.

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,760
And I'll show you that there is a nice three-dimensional graphical representation of that.

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,680
So the work is based on a book that I wrote with Michael Janus and Michael Faro.

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:40,000
So here is the three of us, like in Minneapolis a few years ago. And since the names of the three of

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,120
us are sort of variations on Michael, like this has become known in certain circles already as

17
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:53,120
the three mics manifesto. The book will come out in January. It's in the series Boston Studies in

18
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,480
the Philosophy and History of Science. And its official title is Understanding Quantum Raffles.

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:07,200
Now the book was inspired, and this is the banana that you'll be seeing as my background image

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,280
throughout the talk, by this book by Jeff Boop, Banana World, Quantum Mechanics for Primates.

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,080
And here you see a picture of me and Jeff at a conference in 2019, like in Santiago,

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,360
like following actually right this conference in Cordoba in 2019, where I also gave the talk and

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,960
had a great time. So I should also like put in a plug for like the sequel to Banana World,

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,600
which is one of my favorite books. It's a serious comic on entanglement by Jeff and his daughter

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:47,760
Tanya, a graphic artist called like Totally, Totally Random. So here's the set up I want to

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,320
talk about. And so instead of talking about spin half particles, I'm going to be talking about

27
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:01,200
like entangled bananas, like I said, in honor of Jeff's book. And so what we have, we start out

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,440
with like a pair of entangled bananas, right? So they are described by the usual, you know,

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,480
singlet state. And then like Alice and Bob, you know, the side like on one of three ways to

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,760
peel the banana. And so this is basically just window dressing for like, you know, they have,

31
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,520
they have like a Dubois magnet with which they measure spin in a certain direction. And now

32
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,240
they're going to hold their banana in a particular direction, you know, while peeling it. And then

33
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,160
they take a bite out of the banana and determine whether the banana tastes yasta, tastes yummy,

34
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,520
or nasty, right? So and the results are we're going to, we're going to put like in a correlation

35
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,280
array, which is really the workhorse of Jeff's book, Banana World. And so here you see like,

36
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,080
you know, Alice can measure A, B and C, Bob can measure A, B and C, they can only find,

37
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,320
you know, plus or minus corresponding to yummy and nasty. And what you see is that if they happen,

38
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,000
all the runs in which they happen to peel the same way, they find like a perfect impact correlation,

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,400
and in all the runs in which they peel different ways, they find like an imperfect, like positive

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,960
correlation, right? So look at A, B. So there is like, you know, like a three fourth chance of them

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,520
finding the same 75% chance of finding the same, and only a 25% chance of them finding opposite.

42
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,360
And the question is like, you know, like, what's how to, how to account for this? Now, so this is

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,600
like what you get in this Merman setup, if the angles between like the peeling directions are

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,960
like 120 degrees. Now, you can consider like a more general correlation array of this sort.

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,440
And we're going to consider like, you know, any array that would like this, that would be

46
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,520
non signaling, right? And in order to guarantee non signaling, if you have these anti correlations,

47
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,480
like on the diagonal, it has to be the case that you get uniform marginals. And you do that by

48
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,960
making sure that in all the off diagonal cells, the sum of both the two rows and the two columns

49
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,640
is equal to a half, right? And so since the probabilities, of course, also have to be like

50
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:28,560
numbers between zero and one, you get that you can parameterize this by these chi's that I have here,

51
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,280
and these chi's can run for all the way from minus one to plus one, right? And so I can characterize

52
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:44,400
this correlation array by having three of these parameters for three of these cells, right? This

53
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,400
thing is also going to be symmetric. It doesn't matter if you switch like A and B. So that's the

54
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,200
story here. And you see that in the special case that is considered by Merman, that these chi values

55
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,720
are equal to minus a half, right? So stick that in here. If you put in like minus a half, like this

56
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,360
would be, you know, three halves. So this would be three eighths, right? And this would be, you know,

57
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,640
like, you know, one eighth, right? So you recover that, you recover that Merman's correlation array.

58
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,800
But again, like, you know, you, you, this is a more general form of it. Now, what we're going to try

59
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,720
and do is to see like how, like what subclass of those correlations we can simulate, like with a

60
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,120
raffle, right? And the raffle is our toy model for a local hidden variable theme. And so we have,

61
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,760
we imagine that you have a basket with a bunch of tickets in it, and the tickets like half the

62
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,680
outcomes for like all possible measurements that Alice and Bob can do. Now look at the first ticket,

63
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,280
like, you know, we know that if they, if they measure the same way that they find opposite

64
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,800
results, right? So like, you know, the results on two halves of the tickets have better be up,

65
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,360
has better be opposite. The way it works is that you take a ticket, you rip the ticket in half,

66
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,440
and then you randomly decide like which one goes to Alice and which one goes to Bob, right? So a

67
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,600
ticket where you just switch the left and the right side does not give you a, this does not give

68
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,320
you a new ticket. So with that said, there is like four different tickets, right? So it doesn't

69
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,560
have to be the case that all the pluses are on one side, you could have a case where two of the

70
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,520
pluses are on one side. And like, you know, with one minus, and again, there is three ways of doing

71
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,800
this, right? So you have the minus here is for C here, the minus is for B, and here the minus is

72
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,120
for A, right? And again, keep in mind that it doesn't matter which side of the ticket you're

73
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,720
looking at. Now, we can easily see like if you had like single ticket raffles, just like a basket

74
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,600
with one type, what these sky parameters would be, you know, for your correlation array. Because you

75
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,440
can see that if you have this ticket, no matter whether you take like AA, AB or AC, you always

76
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,440
have like a perfect anti-correlation. And that means that these sky values have to be like plus

77
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,560
one. Like maybe I should go just like back here, right? So the moment that chi is plus one, right,

78
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,600
then you see you have an anti-correlation, the moment that chi is minus one, you have like a

79
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,520
perfect correlation. So okay, so that's easy. Now look at this ticket, there's a little more

80
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,320
complicated. So for AB, you see that there's still a perfect anti-correlation. But if you now look at

81
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,200
AC or at BC, you see that there's a correlation. So you have minus one. And the same is true for

82
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,920
C and D, right? It's just that a different parameter will get like the plus and the other two parameters

83
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:47,520
will be minus. And here then you immediately have like a bell inequality of the type of the

84
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:55,120
Klauser-Hornschirmann Holtz variety. And you can see that, you know, like the sum of these three

85
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,000
parameters is three, four ticket A, and it's going to be minus one for all other tickets. So if you

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,560
take like an arbitrary mix of tickets, right, you would always get like a value somewhere between

87
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:16,160
minus one and three. So and you see that Merman's example where chi, where these three chi's are

88
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,320
minus a half. So that would be, if your sum would be minus three halves, violates this inequality.

89
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,200
Now, the nice thing about this is that you can come up with a very nice geometrical representation

90
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:37,120
of the situation. And that is essentially due to Jeff's long-time collaborator,

91
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:45,760
now deceased, unfortunately, Idemar Petovsky. And so first of all, we start out with like, you know,

92
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,600
like representing these chi values, they can run from minus one to one in like what is called

93
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,080
like a non-signaling cube. Remember, like, you know, this was like the general form of a correlation

94
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,240
array that is non-signaling. And you see that these tickets, like they're represented now by

95
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,040
vertices of that non-signaling cube, right? So it's these four points, right, A, B, C, and D.

96
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:18,000
And a mixed raffle would be represented on like points that are like somewhere in between, right?

97
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,640
And once you have, so imagine, like, you know, you have your basket with tickets.

98
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,920
So if you take this and this and you put a certain mix, you can end up somewhere over here,

99
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,160
but then you take a mix of like, you know, D and C, you get somewhere over here,

100
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,600
but you can also like, you know, now mix those, right? So you get all of that,

101
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,240
and you can also like mix and match, mix and get like on the inside of this thing.

102
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,360
So this is like what is known as the classical tetrahedron. And this is like a very nice way of

103
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,160
geometrically representing, you know, what the local hidden variables here we can do.

104
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,880
The bell in the quality only corresponds to like one facet of this tetrahedron.

105
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,600
It just says that you can't be behind that plane like B, C, D, but you see that there are three

106
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,840
other forbidden regions that you would also have to spell out if you want to define fully,

107
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:23,680
you know, what is and what is not allowed. All right. So now in what is allowed by quantum

108
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,800
mechanics, right? And so in quantum mechanics, the the result that is predicted by quantum

109
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:38,400
is that these kais are just given by the cosine of the the peeling angle, right? In a way, this is

110
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,720
like very satisfying, right? So classically, you see that these kais with these tickets,

111
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,360
they're always going to be plus one or minus one, but wouldn't it be nice to have like a theory

112
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,120
that just allows like a like a continuity of values between minus one and plus one? Quantum

113
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,120
mechanics gives you just that, right? And so it's the cosine of the of the angle and that cosine,

114
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,560
of course, is the inner product of like unit vectors in these different peeling directions.

115
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,760
All right. So if you think about this correlation array, you see that the entire correlation array

116
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,680
can be like characterized by by these parameters, right? These sky parameters. And we can also

117
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:31,440
introduce them for the for the for the diagonal cells, where they're just one. Okay. So and so we'll

118
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,200
I'll I'll define this more carefully later on. But these guys are like, you know, what what can be

119
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,560
called like anti correlation coefficients. As for now, it's just hinges on three values, right? If

120
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,680
chi is one, we saw you have a perfect anti correlation. If it's minus one, you have a perfect

121
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,480
correlation, right? So it makes sense that the anti correlation coefficient is then minus one.

122
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,600
If chi is zero, you have no correlation at all. Now look at introduce now like a matrix, an anti

123
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:08,880
correlation matrix of just these chi values. And you can write that again, like in in terms of these

124
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:16,400
inner products of these unit vectors. Now, this is a grand matrix, right? And it's a well known

125
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,360
property of the of the grand matrix. It doesn't take too much to verify this. But in the interest

126
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,920
of time, I'll skip that. We know that the determinant of that of that matrix is going to be it's going

127
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,440
to have to be greater or equal than zero. And if you just calculate the determinant of this here,

128
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:41,200
you now get this condition. Okay. So quantum mechanics like imposes the condition that that,

129
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,760
you know, that this inequality has to be satisfied. So put differently, right? So quantum

130
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,760
mechanics, once you have the idea that these chi values are the cosine of the of the peeling angles,

131
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,480
so you can you can specify like the correlation array by just giving me three angles. But basic

132
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,520
geometry tells me that once I pick two of these three angles, it puts constraints on the third.

133
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:12,400
And this one, this is the constraint that it that it imposes. And if you now like plot this,

134
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,000
you see that what this picks out is an elliptope, or, you know, what has been called sort of a

135
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,760
fat tetrahedron, you puff it up a bit, the lines here are contained in it. But like, you know,

136
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,360
in the middle, like it's it's blown up a bit. And we call this like the elliptope inequality.

137
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,920
And this then is sort of the quantum analog of the of, you know, what the

138
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,000
the CHSH inequality in the case of the Merman setup, right? And remember, for the full

139
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,880
specification, we don't need just one, but we need four of those inequalities here,

140
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:53,040
we only need one nonlinear inequality. And this inequality is satisfied by Merman's example,

141
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,040
right? I mean, if you just look at it, you see that this if you put in a half,

142
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,000
you get like exactly that this is going to be equal to zero.

143
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,000
So this is actually a neat result, I think, because it gives a concrete example of like

144
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,680
a cartoon that you often see about how the convex set for, you know, non signaling quantum

145
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,840
and local hidden variable theories are related. Right. So so here is the here's a cross section

146
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,000
of our drawing, right, with the non signaling cube, the elliptope and the tetrahedron, right?

147
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,560
And now compare that to like the cartoon that is in Banana World, right, where you see like

148
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,760
the non signaling cube with like, you know, like the maximal variation, like a Perpeco-Rohlich box,

149
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,560
right, was a super quantum correlation that still is non signaling and doesn't violate special

150
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,760
relativity. Then you have the quantum convex set. And then in the middle, you have the local

151
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,920
polytope. And the beauty is, is that in this particular example of the of the Merman setup,

152
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,200
you you reproduce like now exactly, you know, what you just have as a cartoon in in general.

153
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,160
And you can play the same game for bananas now entangled bananas of higher spin. And so in our

154
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,840
book, we do this right. So here's what the correlation array looks like. Just one cell for a spin one

155
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,440
banana. The anti correlation coefficient, it turns out, you know, which is defined like this.

156
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll get to that in a moment, like stays the same is still the cosine. If you go for two,

157
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,840
three halves still the same cosines. So all these correlations are all like constrained by the exact

158
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:53,680
same elliptope inequality. That's not the case if you now try to simulate them with these raffles.

159
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,760
So we saw that, you know, like if you do this for spin half, you get like the tetrahedron, right,

160
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,920
so you get something with like four facets like this. If you now go up to higher spin, you see

161
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,720
that you get a little more structure on these on these on these facets. So this is what it looks

162
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,400
like for spin one and notice that this point here is going to touch the the the elliptope

163
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,280
for for spin three halves, it's not going to touch the elliptope again. But for all integer spin,

164
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,120
it will, right, you see this gets more and more faceted, more and more

165
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,120
vertices. And like you can, it's very suggestive that if you go up to higher and higher spin,

166
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,800
it gets more and more close to the elliptope, but never quite gets there, right.

167
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:50,480
Now, the so so far it may seem that this elliptope somehow captures like something special about

168
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,280
quantum mechanics, in particular, like we used, you know, sort of as hidden like in what I showed

169
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,960
you, what we use like, you know, the Bourne rule, the Hilbert space formalism. But in fact, this

170
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,040
inequality is not new to quantum mechanics at all. It has been known to statisticians since the 1890s,

171
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,480
and it's basically a general constraint on the correlations between any three random variables,

172
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,160
right, which also like, you know, makes it understandable that even if you go to higher

173
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,400
spin particles in quantum mechanics, you'll never get out of the get out of the elliptope.

174
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,720
So this work is due to Carl Pearson, and mostly to Utney Yule. So Pearson, of course, these days

175
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,520
is mostly remembers for his dubious role in the eugenics movement, but he's also like, you know,

176
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,280
like a very important character in statistics. So let me run to this quickly, right. So now we're

177
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,320
talking about some arbitrary random variables with sets of possible outcomes that I'm going to

178
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,520
keep discreet. And in fact, I'm only interested in a case where you have you have a random variable

179
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:55,440
with only two outcomes, like, you know, yummy and nasty. And so I'm going to restrict my attention to

180
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,560
what we call balanced random variables. And that just means that if X i X of i is a possible value,

181
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:09,520
minus X i is two, and that the probability of X i and the probability of minus X i is the same.

182
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,240
And that simplifies matters, because that means that in that case, the expectation value is going

183
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,880
to be zero. And that simplifies like some other variables that some other quantities that we're

184
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,000
interested in. So we're looking at the variance, right? So the expectation value of X minus the

185
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
expected value of X squared. If the expected value of X is zero, then the variation of X is just the

186
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,080
expectation value of X squared. The standard deviation is the square root of that. And then

187
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,520
the covariance, again, like, you know, in general would be like the expectation value of X minus

188
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,880
the expectation value of X times Y minus the expectation value of Y, if these two expectation

189
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:58,080
values are zero, then that is just going to be equal to the expectation value of X times Y.

190
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,560
And I now introduce like what is called the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is just the

191
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:13,200
covariance of the Pearson correlation coefficients of X and Y is the covariance of X and Y divided

192
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,080
by the corresponding standard deviation, sigma X and sigma Y. And so if X and Y are balanced,

193
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,880
this is just the expectation value of X and Y divided by these standard deviations.

194
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,520
And you can immediately see two properties like, you know, the Pearson correlation coefficient

195
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,040
of a variable with itself is just one. And it doesn't matter if you look at a correlation coefficient

196
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:50,320
X, Y or Y, X. And we'll now I'll now prove for you that such such any triplet of such variables

197
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,960
is going to have to satisfy this elliptope inequality. And this was shown by Yule in the

198
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,240
late 1890s. So here's where here's one way to do it, like, you know, consider, you know, for any

199
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:07,840
triplet v1 v2 v3, like this quantity over here. So I'm looking at the expectation value of some

200
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,640
expression squared. So I know this is going to be greater or equal to zero. And now I'm going to

201
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,960
work this out. Okay, so I take like, you know, like this term times the rest that gives me this

202
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:26,080
here, right. And so notes that I now get like, you know, v1. And then I have like, x times x,

203
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,240
right, expectation value x squared divided by sigma x squared. And then we have the x times the y,

204
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,760
the x times z. And then you have similar terms for like, if you now do the v2 y over sigma y and v3

205
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,840
z over sigma c. And you see that in here, like you have like all these Pearson correlation

206
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,120
coefficients, it just looks like that. Right. And I can write this like a little more

207
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:58,640
concisely and compactly as justice matrix with these Pearson correlation coefficients

208
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:07,520
sandwiched between like, you know, the column vector v1 v2 v3, and the row vector v1 v2 v3.

209
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,840
And remember that this thing has to be greater or equal than zero for any, for any value of v1,

210
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,760
v2, v3, which means that that matrix row is positive semi definite, which means that the

211
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,080
determinant of row has to be greater or equal than zero. And it follows that, you know, that

212
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:35,360
that's just the elliptope inequality. Right. So there we have it again. Okay. So now,

213
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:44,000
look at the special case that x, y, and z are the taste of Alice's banana, right, in this

214
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,640
experiment in the, in the Merman setup, right. So x is the, the taste of Alice's banana when she

215
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,920
peels in the A direction, y is the taste of Alice's banana when she peels in the B direction and z

216
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:02,320
is the taste when Alice's banana when she peels in the C direction. All right. So now the obvious

217
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:09,040
problem is, is that as Papescu points out in the, in the preface or the forward of banana world,

218
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,800
a banana can only be eaten once, right, once it's peeled, it's peeled, once it's tasted, it's

219
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:22,080
tasted. But there's, we'll see there's ways around this, this, this problem. So first I note that

220
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,880
these variables are balanced, right. So we have to now give them some numerical value rather than

221
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,640
just yummy or nasty, but you know, inspired by spin, you know, like instead of having like a half

222
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,360
h bar, we now have like a half, like a B bar, you know, which I call the banana split, which is just

223
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:46,080
boops constant B divided by two pi. And we're going to pick units such that B bar is equal to one.

224
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,240
And so then, you know, these, we see that these, that these variables are perfectly balanced,

225
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:59,520
the expectation value is zero, the variance, right. So it's like, you know, half, half the time,

226
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,240
like, you know, it's the product is, it's, it's, it's one half squared, the other half is like,

227
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,040
you know, minus a half squared, and that adds up to one fourth, the standard deviation take the

228
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:17,200
square root that is like a half. Now the covariance here, it's a little trickier.

229
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,680
And what we're going to do. And like, you know, if you, if you're squeamish about this, like, we

230
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:30,640
did find a way to avoid like this counterfactual reasoning. But I think it's perfectly innocuous.

231
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,520
We're going to use my the opposite, if you want to find the covariance of the variables Alice,

232
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,360
Alice's taste of banana when peeling a and the taste of Alice's banana when peeling B.

233
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:54,720
So half Alice appeal a and then have her use minus what Bob finds when he peels B as a proxy

234
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,640
for what she would have find had she peeled B instead.

235
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,920
And so basically, like, you know, that so we use we calculate this thing here,

236
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:13,840
and we can use our correlation array to figure this out. Right. So we have like, if the if the

237
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:23,280
if the tastes are are the are the same, we get we get we get like one fourth. What is the probability

238
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,920
of that happening? Well, you need to add these two things. Right. So that's a half one minus

239
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,120
guy AB. And then, you know, like, if they're opposite, it's minus one fourth. And the probability

240
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,920
of that happening is this, if you work this out, you see that this is one fourth times guy AB.

241
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,400
And if you now like calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, you see that that is

242
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,960
exactly equal to guy AB. Right. I already took an advance on that result calling this guy be like

243
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,240
an anti correlation coefficient, right. And the anti is because of this minus.

244
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,240
All right. So the elliptop inequality, you know, I can just now write for this for these particular

245
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,920
variables, right. So in terms of these rows, now, in terms of these guys.

246
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,280
And so this is just exactly the same. But there is a few problems, right. So the first problem

247
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,800
we already dealt with, like, how do we determine the taste of these two of a Alice feeling a and

248
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:25,600
Alice feeling B and one run? Well, you know, have or use Bob's result as a proxy for one of those.

249
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,200
Right. Now, the second problem is like, you know, we can only do this for two tastes for two

250
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,640
feelings in one run. Well, that's not a big problem either. Like, you can just have different ones.

251
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,800
Right. So if you think about it, that's what we always do, you know, like you like, if you think

252
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,640
about the early tests of the CHSH inequality, they weren't switching the settings like, you know,

253
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,320
from run to run, you just take measurements for one pair of standing and then fill in another

254
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,520
pair. That's all perfectly fine. So that we can do the third problem seems to be a lot nastier.

255
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,640
And there the promise is that, you know, that we we derive this elliptop inequality from the

256
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:11,440
condition starting that this the expectation value, this quantity is always greater equal than zero.

257
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:19,040
Right. But the point is that we cannot determine the value of this in one in one run. And it would

258
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,960
seem that if if all these three variables like can only take on values like plus or minus a half,

259
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,680
that yes, it's going to be greater equal than zero. But that inequality is not tight because like,

260
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,080
you know, like we could easily the smallest we could get this is to something like, you know,

261
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,000
a half, like, you know, like a state plus and minus, minus here, and then we have a quarter.

262
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,880
So this took us a while to to to figure out and the the the answer actually hinges on like,

263
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,600
you know, like an interesting property of quantum mechanics, namely that in quantum mechanics,

264
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,640
it's perfectly possible for a sum to have a definite value, even if the individual terms

265
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,160
in that sum do not. Right. So the simplest example I can think of is like, you know, the Hamiltonian

266
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,760
for harmonic oscillator, clearly P and Q cannot have like, you know, definite values at the same

267
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,120
time, but you know, the Hamiltonian can. And so to look at this a little more clearly, right,

268
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,320
so if you if you were looking essentially at sort of a sum of like her mission operators,

269
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,600
linear combination, and that in and of itself should be like a good operator. And so if you

270
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,880
introduce like, you know, now like in analogy with a spin vector, like a taste vector,

271
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:41,040
you get, you can write like the taste in the A direction as like the inner products of like

272
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:49,120
T with like the unit vector in the A direction, same for TB, same for TC. And then the inequality

273
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,280
becomes this, and you see that we're in a product thing, but the the taste vector with this vector,

274
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:03,360
and this will be zero whenever this combination is zero. Right. And so if you if there are if you

275
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,000
pick the right peeling directions for starters that need to be in one plane, you can actually

276
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
like achieve that. So this this inequality is tight. And this result applies to so the general

277
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,720
result of yield does applies to to this to this quantum example. All right. So what do I want

278
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,880
to conclude from this? Okay. So the point is, is that this elliptope inequality that we derived

279
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,080
first within quantum mechanics from the geometry of Hilbert space can also be derived without

280
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,040
quantum mechanics as a general constraint on correlations between three random variables.

281
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:46,560
And is this this distinction like actually we got from within from without from a song by Bob Dylan.

282
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:14,960
So the message then this is the big message of the of the talk is that what this suggests

283
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,920
is that the basic Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics is just a new framework for

284
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:25,600
handling probabilities. Right. And so this take on quantum mechanics, which has been dubbed

285
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,080
boobism is a pun on cubism by Robert Mischewitz belongs, I think, to a class of informational

286
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:40,960
makeovers of the much maligned Copenhagen interpretation. And so in order to to make that

287
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,160
clear, like I want to talk, I'll take five more minutes to make the point. And this is far more

288
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,280
speculative and tentative than what I've said so far. I think it's best to sort of think in terms

289
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,080
of like a genealogy of quantum interpretations. And so we got like two versions of quantum

290
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,480
mechanics around 1925 26. First, we have matrix mechanics. And Heisenberg's big discovery was

291
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,040
that these problems in spectroscopy that he was running into, just call for a new framework for

292
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:16,400
dealing with with physics, just as like the problems that people had run into in electrodynamics

293
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,800
around the turn of the century, called for a new framework of dealing with spatial temporal

294
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,240
relations. Now, of course, a little bit later, like Schrodinger comes up with wave mechanics,

295
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,880
and his big discovery compatible with Heisenberg was very different, like namely,

296
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,920
here the idea is that something wavy is underlying the behavior that we're seeing. And the analogy

297
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,160
here is with wave optics in the 19th century. And so they famously didn't care for each other,

298
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,720
for each other's views, like, you know, like Heisenberg calling wave mechanics disgusting,

299
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,320
and Schrodinger calling matrix mechanics repulsive. And but of course, like mathematical

300
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,080
equivalence was rapidly proved in part by Schrodinger himself, but then by the rock,

301
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,360
yard down for Neumann. And that kind of papers over like a very different way of thinking about

302
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,720
the state, the status of the state vector in the Hilbert space. And I think roughly you can say

303
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,640
that the descendants of wave mechanics, those are the ontic interpretations of quantum mechanics,

304
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:17,360
think Everett, the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory, and the Girardi-Romini-Weber spontaneous

305
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,240
collapse theory. And the descendants of matrix mechanics are the epistemic interpretations

306
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:30,720
in where I would include Copenhagen, Cubism, and now like, you know, Bubism. And so just a quick way

307
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,920
of sort of showing, you know, what I'm, what I'm after, like contrast Boop with Everett, right?

308
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,240
So for Boop, like what the Hilbert space is doing you is doing for you, it's giving you the Born

309
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,920
Rule, but it doesn't represent stuff, right? In order to represent stuff, you need like some specific

310
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,720
quantum applications running on this new quantum operating system to use kind of the metaphor

311
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,840
of Nielsen and Chang's book on quantum information. Now, for Everett, it's just the way,

312
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,960
it's just the other way around. Hilbert space gives you stuff, you know,

313
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,400
Sean Carroll, like says, like, you know, the world is made out of wave functions, right?

314
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,040
So, but it doesn't give you the Born Rule now, right? I mean, so for that they appeal to decision

315
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:16,480
theory for agents and a multiverse, okay? Now, so this is Oxford Everettians, there's also another

316
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,840
class of Everettians, Berlin Everettians like Christoph Lainer, who really have the courage

317
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,760
of their convictions, who use like Hilbert space both to represent stuff and to get the Born Rule

318
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,520
and of course, it's a good Everettian, right? You take advantage of the fact that in a multiverse,

319
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:38,720
you really can have your cake and eat it too. So now, for more careful exegesis of all of this,

320
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,160
you, you know, I'm going to refer you to our book, where especially like, you know,

321
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:51,520
microfarro, like, lace this out, like much more patiently than I just did, and I'm going to leave

322
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,280
you like with one more version of this, of this Dylan song.

323
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:30,240
Now, right, I'm happy to take some questions if there's time.

324
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:39,120
Yes, we have some minutes for comments or questions. If you want to make a comment or question, please

325
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:56,560
indicate it in the chat. I have a short question. Do you think that, or my real question is,

326
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,400
if you have some experience in the classroom with this type of

327
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:12,320
topological approximation mechanics, do you think that it can help in education?

328
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,160
I'm just making sure. Do you think the question is, like, do you think that this

329
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,400
way of thinking about quantum mechanics can help education?

330
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:36,320
No, this form to present some results with the topological forms can help in education

331
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,000
of quantum mechanics in the in the courses in the universe.

332
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,040
Yeah, no, I mean, like, I'm currently teaching a course on introducing, like,

333
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,000
non physics majors to quantum mechanics, where I very much use this,

334
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,640
use this approach that I showed you, right? And so, and like,

335
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,560
yeah, and so, but it's, I mean, it gives you like a particular way of thinking about quantum

336
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,160
mechanics, right? It really pushes this idea that quantum mechanics is like a, you know,

337
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,440
the kinematics of quantum mechanics, right? The basic formalism is a new framework for handling

338
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,600
probabilities, right? And that, you know, in order to do anything else, right, now you need to do

339
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:20,160
dynamics, you need to like introduce like stuff, right? And what quantum mechanics is telling you

340
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,560
that it had to, that it has to behave according to the rules of quantum, right? So, so that's,

341
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,480
that's the view I'm pushing. Historically, what I find interesting is that if you now look at

342
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,760
modern books on probability theory and statistics, is that Hilbert space methods are being used in

343
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,600
these books. And somehow like, so as a historian, I'm very interested, like how it came to be,

344
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,000
that there seems to be very little communication between people in physics using Hilbert space

345
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,120
methods, and people in general statistics using like Hilbert space methods. Okay, thank you. And

346
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:07,520
there is a question from Federico Hoelig. Yes, thanks, Michelle, for, for this wonderful talk.

347
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:13,920
It's always great to hear you. I always get really excited. And I want to learn more about

348
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:22,640
this approach. And my question is related to what is the stake or the take of your interpretation

349
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:31,040
with regard to non-locality? Because if you interpret quantum mechanics as a new probability

350
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:38,000
formalism, what can you say about the strong claims that the word is local versus the word

351
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,760
is non-local? What will you say about that? Yeah, so, so the, that's a difficult question.

352
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,680
So, so what I would say is that, you know, in the spirit of what I showed you is that,

353
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:02,000
you know, like you would, you would have thought that special relativity like requires you to,

354
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,440
you know, like tell some story where you can like screen off like any correlation by something,

355
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,560
you know, that by a common cause. And it turns out that the constraints are not that tight,

356
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,000
you can have like, you can have like a very much more liberal constraint and still be

357
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,280
non-singling. In fact, you can go beyond quantum mechanics, and you can have like PR boxes. And

358
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,000
so to, I would say you just have to get used to the fact that you should resist the temptation

359
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,480
that when you have these like correlations that cannot be dealt with sort of the standard way

360
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,720
screening them off by conditionalizing on common causes, that you think of these as just

361
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,840
constrained produced by natures and not like, oh, Alice does one thing and then like, you know,

362
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:50,160
like it travels like instantaneously to Bob or vice versa. And if you, if you, if you go for this

363
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,520
if you go this epistemic route, that is easier, right? I mean, like, I think a lot of students

364
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,000
in quantum mechanics who, you know, like, no matter how, how often you tell them that astrodinger,

365
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,520
that astrodinger wave function is not a field on ordinary space, still have this picture like,

366
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,800
well, then you do a measurement and the whole thing goes poof, instantaneously. And like now

367
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,440
you're stretching your head like, you know, what is it that is traveling from like Alice to Bob

368
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,280
that then like frustratingly you can never use to send a signal, right? And so I'm hoping that

369
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,240
this approach will sort of prevent people like, you know, from going down that particular rabbit

370
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:42,640
hole in the first place. Okay, thanks. Thanks. It's clear. Yeah. I tend to agree. Yes.
