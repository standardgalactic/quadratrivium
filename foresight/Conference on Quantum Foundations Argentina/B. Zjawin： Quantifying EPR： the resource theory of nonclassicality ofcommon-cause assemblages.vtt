WEBVTT

00:00.880 --> 00:08.320
Yes. Okay, great. So, yeah, let me start by thanking the organizers

00:08.320 --> 00:12.880
for the opportunity to present my work. It's actually the first time that I'm attending

00:12.880 --> 00:18.160
this conference and I must say that I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed a lot of talks for the

00:18.160 --> 00:26.080
past three days. So thank you for having me here. My name is Bata Ziawin and I'm a PhD student at

00:26.080 --> 00:31.440
the International Center for Fury of Quantum Technologies at the University of Gdańsk in

00:31.440 --> 00:37.040
Poland. And we have a Quantum Foundations group here. The leader of the group is Anna

00:37.040 --> 00:43.200
Bellin-Sainz and as you can see she's also a collaborator on this work as well as David

00:43.200 --> 00:49.920
Schmidt and Mati Homan. So today I will talk about quantifying EPR, the Resource Fury of

00:49.920 --> 00:59.040
Non-Classicality of Common Cause Assemblages. We recently put this draft on our archive so

00:59.040 --> 01:03.440
if you find what I will be talking about interesting you can of course ask me questions

01:03.440 --> 01:10.720
but I also encourage you to look at the paper. Okay, so let me start with a question.

01:11.920 --> 01:19.200
Is quantum steering spooky action at a distance? Because it is sometimes called this way. So the

01:19.200 --> 01:24.800
steering phenomena is a form of non-classical correlations that arise when one considers

01:24.800 --> 01:31.360
measurements performed on half of a bipartite system prepared on an entangled state. So if we

01:31.360 --> 01:38.080
try to represent the situation graphically we end up with a picture like this. Here the double lines

01:38.080 --> 01:43.600
correspond to quantum systems and single lines correspond to classical systems. So we have

01:44.560 --> 01:51.200
we have two parties, we have Alice and we have Bob and they share entangled states. Alice prepares

01:51.200 --> 01:57.280
measurement on it so this represents a measurement device that takes a classical input x and outputs

01:57.920 --> 02:06.000
classical variable a and now depending on x and a on Alice's side Bob's system can be described

02:06.080 --> 02:14.080
by this conditional quantum state row a given x. So why is it sometimes called spooky action at a

02:14.080 --> 02:21.600
distance? Well it is because Alice and Bob are two space-like separated parties but it seems that

02:21.600 --> 02:29.440
Alice can somehow steer Bob's system into this conditional state. So the term steering was

02:29.440 --> 02:36.800
actually given by Schrodinger himself and he called it that because from this scenario it kind

02:36.800 --> 02:44.480
of seems that maybe Alice has an influence on what's happening in Bob's laboratory. But this is

02:44.480 --> 02:49.760
not the only perspective that we can take when we talk about this scenario and a different one was

02:49.760 --> 02:57.600
endorsed actually by EPR themselves so by Einstein Podolski and Rosen in their original work and it

02:57.600 --> 03:04.160
is that simply Alice updates her knowledge of the state of Bob's system by performing a measurement

03:04.160 --> 03:09.760
on a system correlated with his and of course it makes perfect sense that Alice and Bob shared

03:09.760 --> 03:15.360
a correlated system so when Alice learned something about it she also updates her knowledge on what's

03:15.360 --> 03:21.840
happening in Bob's laboratory. So is steering spooky action at a distance? Well not really it's

03:21.840 --> 03:28.800
neither spooky or action at a distance and because of this throughout this presentation I will not

03:28.800 --> 03:36.240
refer to this phenomenon as steering but simply as EPR scenario where again EPR stands for Einstein

03:36.240 --> 03:44.160
Podolski and Rosen. So well we could say that it's just a change of name and maybe from a technical

03:44.160 --> 03:49.280
perspective well it doesn't make much difference but from the foundational perspective it actually

03:49.280 --> 03:55.680
makes a huge difference how we look at this scenario. So let me just recap everything that

03:55.680 --> 04:02.000
I just said so from Schrödinger point of view he called this phenomenon quantum steering

04:03.440 --> 04:10.560
in a sense that quantum because he thought that quantum state is a physical property of a system

04:10.560 --> 04:16.800
and then the fact that Alice steers Bob means that there is some kind of supergluminar causal

04:16.800 --> 04:23.200
influence. So in the modern language we would call a set of beliefs that see ontic view which basically

04:23.200 --> 04:30.240
means that this quantum states describe distinct physical states of the world. While what EPR

04:30.240 --> 04:37.280
interpreted it as they said well spooky action at a distance is not really acceptable so quantum

04:37.280 --> 04:43.200
state we can take it to be a representation of one's information about the system and then in

04:43.200 --> 04:49.680
this scenario Alice simply learns about true state of Bob's system and this point of view

04:49.680 --> 04:58.720
could be described in the modern language as epistering sorry which is basically that quantum

04:58.720 --> 05:04.320
states represent states of knowledge about the world. Okay so after this foundational

05:06.080 --> 05:12.800
motivation let me go into the actual resource theory. Okay so we will talk about EPR scenarios

05:12.800 --> 05:18.880
and what we take to be the defining features of an EPR scenario are the following. First

05:18.880 --> 05:24.400
common cause causal structure so as I said we have two parties Alice and Bob and they share a

05:24.400 --> 05:30.400
common cause which in this case is quantum and the second defining feature of this scenario are

05:30.400 --> 05:37.360
types of systems that parties have access to so on Alice's side it will be a classical input

05:37.360 --> 05:44.160
and a classical output while on Bob's side it will be a trivial input because he has no input at all

05:44.160 --> 05:55.200
and a quantum output. And it's very usual to describe EPR scenarios with quantum assemblages

05:55.200 --> 06:02.880
so a quantum assemblages assemblage is an object like this where each conditional state

06:02.880 --> 06:07.840
contains information about what's going on on Alice's side so this probability distribution of

06:07.840 --> 06:16.400
obtaining an outcome A given an input X and what's happening on Bob's laboratory so this conditional state.

06:19.200 --> 06:25.200
Okay so we want to create a resource theory of assemblages. Resource theories allow one to

06:25.200 --> 06:31.600
formally quantify physical resources so in our case the resources are assemblages and what we

06:31.600 --> 06:37.840
want to quantify is their non-classic quality. The structure of a resource theory is completely

06:37.840 --> 06:43.120
determined by the set of three operations so three operations are operations that cannot

06:43.120 --> 06:48.480
create a resourceful object and because of this they can also be applied to different resources

06:48.480 --> 06:54.640
for free because if we apply a free operation to the resource it will not increase the resourcefulness

06:54.640 --> 07:02.160
of it. And now for the case of assemblages our upload follows the recent developments of resource

07:02.160 --> 07:08.320
theories for studying non-classicality of common cost processes wherein the three operations are

07:08.320 --> 07:14.960
local operations and shared randomness so as I said an EPR scenario is simply a common cost

07:14.960 --> 07:21.040
process and because of this we take a lesson from some papers that were already published

07:21.280 --> 07:27.120
common cost processes are studied with LOSR operations and in particular there is this

07:27.120 --> 07:34.800
paper here that basically creates a new branch of entanglement LOSR entanglement in contrast

07:34.800 --> 07:40.960
to LOCC entanglement where CC stands for classical communication and that people usually talk about

07:42.000 --> 07:49.360
and in this paper it is shown that taking this LOSR perspective actually resolves some anomalies

07:49.360 --> 07:57.120
of entanglement and there is also this paper here which treats common cost boxes so things like

07:57.120 --> 08:02.560
Bell's scenario where we have a common cost structure again but here both parties just

08:02.560 --> 08:09.280
have access to classical inputs and classical outputs and because we can study both entanglement

08:09.280 --> 08:15.200
and bell types scenarios using LOSR it means that we can also study their interplay which is really

08:15.200 --> 08:21.040
amazing because it means that we can have like one unified resource theory of common cost processes

08:21.040 --> 08:27.440
with different types of resources like entanglement bell boxes or assemblages and we can study

08:28.160 --> 08:34.560
their relative non-classicality. I would also recommend this paper if you are interested in

08:34.560 --> 08:40.400
this stuff because it talks about a type independent resource theory which considers even more types

08:40.400 --> 08:48.160
than just entanglement assemblages and bell boxes. In the literature it was pretty well

08:48.160 --> 08:56.640
motivated to study LOSR for common cost processes but even from simply looking at the DPR scenario

08:56.640 --> 09:02.880
well we can see that it is a common cost process so we have two parties it's perfectly fine to

09:02.880 --> 09:08.640
allow local operations for each of the parties local operations can be classical or quantum

09:09.600 --> 09:15.120
it there will be quantum on both side and because we want to study the non-classicality

09:15.120 --> 09:22.080
of assemblages we do allow classical common causes for free so what you can see on this picture here

09:22.080 --> 09:28.560
on the right is an assemblage where the common cost is classical so Alice gets a classical

09:29.120 --> 09:36.160
variable lambda and she performs her measurement while Bob prepares a quantum state depending

09:36.160 --> 09:44.640
on the value of the classical variable and we call such assemblage a free assemblage because it

09:44.640 --> 09:51.040
can be created solely by free operations so LOSR operations and it can be decomposed like this

09:51.040 --> 09:55.920
so on Alice's side we just have this probability distribution where lambda is the short variable

09:55.920 --> 10:05.520
and on Bob's side he prepares this quantum state. So for now I'll just mention that there are also

10:05.520 --> 10:12.080
different approaches to studying non-classicality of assemblages and there is one resource theory

10:12.080 --> 10:18.240
that was developed a few years ago that the set of the free operations in this resource theory

10:18.240 --> 10:24.480
was the hasty one-way classical communication and local operations and after I'll introduce

10:24.480 --> 10:31.600
our approach the LOSR one I will compare it to the previous one but I'll do it later on in my

10:31.600 --> 10:38.640
presentation. Okay so what are these LOSR operations here in black we have the original

10:38.640 --> 10:45.360
assemblage and now the most general LOSR operation that we can perform on it as first analysis side

10:45.360 --> 10:50.960
we have a classical prep processing of this classical variable we have a classical post

10:50.960 --> 10:58.560
processing of the output variable on Bob's side we have this post processing of his quantum state

10:58.560 --> 11:07.600
so this will be just a CPTP map and now the actions of of local operations on Alice's side

11:07.600 --> 11:13.840
and the local operation on Bob's side can be correlated by shared randomness so classical

11:13.840 --> 11:22.080
common cause so this will be the lambda that's distributed to Alice and to Bob. Okay so now that

11:22.080 --> 11:27.520
we have a resource theory and we have the set of free operations we can study the properties of the

11:27.520 --> 11:34.080
preorder so we can study the relative non-classicality of assemblages and what we showed is that

11:34.080 --> 11:41.200
assemblage conversion under LOSR can be tested using a single instance of a semi-definite program

11:42.400 --> 11:47.360
so one assemblage is said to be more non-classical than another if it can be fairly converted to

11:47.360 --> 11:53.280
the latter so if we have the black assemblage and we can convert it into a different one the one

11:53.280 --> 12:00.880
with primes with free operations well it means that they can be used for example for the same task

12:01.840 --> 12:08.640
because they have this one will be at least as non-classical as this one

12:10.560 --> 12:16.880
so we showed that checking such conversions can be tested by checking if the following program is

12:16.880 --> 12:23.040
feasible so I have the semi-definite program here but maybe let me not go into details about it

12:23.360 --> 12:28.800
if any of you is like interested in the details I can just we can talk about it later doing the

12:28.800 --> 12:35.280
questions but the important lesson here is that how this program works is that you just input

12:35.280 --> 12:40.880
two assemblages and it tells you what there one can be converted into the other and it works really

12:40.880 --> 12:46.480
fast it's just a single instance so it's really amazing because it's a great tool to study the

12:46.480 --> 12:53.280
relative non-classicality of assemblages and we use this to study the structure of the preorder

12:53.280 --> 12:59.200
and one interesting result that we found is an infinite family of incomparable resources so resources

12:59.200 --> 13:06.320
that none of them can be converted into any other and this family goes like as follows so what we

13:06.320 --> 13:12.240
checked is that we had in scenario where we have Alice and Bob and they shared this state here so

13:12.240 --> 13:19.360
they share a partially entangled state now Alice performs sigma z and sigma x measurements on it

13:19.920 --> 13:25.280
so such an assemblage would be described like this so Alice performs this measurement Bob does

13:25.280 --> 13:31.360
nothing and they share this partially entangled state but now something else that we allow is

13:31.360 --> 13:38.640
mixing with noise so the assemblage that we study is defined here so it's parameter parameter

13:38.720 --> 13:46.320
randomized by these two parameters theta and p where theta corresponds to this theta here in

13:46.320 --> 13:53.520
the partially entangled states and p corresponds to the level of mixing with noise so you can see

13:53.520 --> 14:00.160
here that with some probability we create this element of the assemblage and then we mix it with

14:00.160 --> 14:07.520
noise and now the results of the program that I just showed you are presented in this graph here

14:07.520 --> 14:14.480
so here each dot corresponds to one assemblage so for example this one is an assemblage created

14:14.480 --> 14:20.480
where Alice and Bob share a state with theta being equal to pi over four so it's a so-called

14:20.480 --> 14:27.440
maximally entangled state and they don't mix it with noise because p is equal to one and now the

14:27.440 --> 14:33.840
arrow from here to here means that under LOS operations we can covert this assemblage to this

14:33.840 --> 14:39.120
one where this one is when Alice and Bob share a state with theta being equal to pi over 12

14:39.120 --> 14:47.680
and they mix it with noise with this p being equal to 0.9 so as you can see we can like

14:47.680 --> 14:53.040
using the sdp we can check whether different converters are possible but one interesting

14:53.040 --> 14:59.280
property that we can see here is in this family here so for p being equal one for different

14:59.280 --> 15:07.440
values of theta no conversions are possible and we actually we checked it analytically

15:07.440 --> 15:12.320
and we showed that this is the family of incomparable resources so for all values of theta

15:13.120 --> 15:19.840
from 0 to pi over 4 so like up to a so-called maximally entangled state all of these assemblages

15:19.840 --> 15:27.200
for p being equal to 1 are incomparable and yeah we also developed some new epr monotone

15:27.280 --> 15:34.320
in order to confirm this result analytically. Okay as I promised I'll now compare it to prior

15:34.320 --> 15:40.400
work which was a resource theory of so-called steering under so-hastical collaborations and

15:40.400 --> 15:45.600
one way classical communication from Bob to Alice so this set of free operations is of course a

15:45.600 --> 15:52.160
valid set of free operations for epr scenarios which means that it cannot create a resourceful

15:52.160 --> 15:58.320
object and it goes as here so again in black we have the original assemblage and in green

15:59.280 --> 16:07.280
we have the free operation so here Bob has an instrument that he performs on his part of the

16:07.280 --> 16:13.920
state and as an output he gets first of all the classical variable that he sends to Alice

16:13.920 --> 16:21.120
and also his quantum state and now Alice has a classical pre-processing of her variable that

16:21.120 --> 16:26.640
depends on the message that she received from Bob and she also has a post-processing

16:27.360 --> 16:33.920
so the motivation behind the set of free operations was that the authors claim that

16:33.920 --> 16:43.040
is the most general set of free operations that does not compromise the security of one sided

16:43.040 --> 16:50.320
device independent quantum key distribution protocols for them steering as a useful resource.

16:51.200 --> 16:56.640
So the motivation here is a particular protocol in quantum information.

16:57.600 --> 17:02.960
Okay so if you want to compare it to our work to LOSR approach the first thing that we can show

17:02.960 --> 17:09.200
is a pretty big difference so the two resource theories actually have different pre-orders

17:09.200 --> 17:14.800
which means that if we have a set of assemblages and we want to study it and we will study it with

17:14.800 --> 17:20.400
two different approaches this one here and with our LOSR approach we can actually get

17:20.400 --> 17:28.400
different results because the pre-orders are different. Now our LOSR approach has some conceptual

17:28.400 --> 17:35.680
advantages over this one and one is that it has a clear physical motivation so motivation for

17:35.680 --> 17:41.600
this approach here as one way LOSCC is this one sided device independent quantum key distribution

17:41.600 --> 17:49.760
protocol while for our LOSR approach the the conceptual underpinning is more

17:50.560 --> 17:55.360
foundational because it comes from the causal structure of this scenario and because of this

17:56.320 --> 18:01.440
we have this unification of every type of non-classical correlation in bell-like scenarios

18:01.440 --> 18:08.960
so we have a single LOSR resource theory for common cost scenarios and there are also some

18:08.960 --> 18:14.640
technical advantages so for example our LOSR approach is simpler to characterize and study

18:15.600 --> 18:21.280
this SDP this semi-different program is a good example that in our approaches it's really easy

18:21.280 --> 18:29.040
to study the conversions and the other technical advantage is that our approach for the bipartite

18:29.040 --> 18:35.120
scenario actually has some direct generalizations for example to multi-partite EPR scenarios but

18:35.120 --> 18:42.400
also to bobov input and channel EPR scenarios where by channel EPR scenarios I mean something

18:42.400 --> 18:50.480
that's usually referred to as channel steering and we left bobov input at channel for future work

18:50.480 --> 18:55.680
but we did study the multi-partite scenarios so let me just say a few words about this right now

18:56.320 --> 19:02.080
so let's go to a multi-partite setup which means that we now have more LSS for example this picture

19:02.080 --> 19:07.680
here we have two LSS and as you can see everything just generalizes from the bipartite case so we still

19:07.680 --> 19:15.360
have a common cost so we have the shared randomness that goes to each party and each party also can

19:15.360 --> 19:22.480
perform local operations so we have local operations for Alice 1, Alice 2 and for Bob and what we

19:22.480 --> 19:29.040
showed in the multi-partite scenario is that a sandwich conversion can be tested using a single

19:29.040 --> 19:33.520
instance of a semi-definite program so we generalize the program that I showed you before

19:33.520 --> 19:39.440
to to work for multi-partite scenarios and we also found a family of incomparable resources

19:39.440 --> 19:45.520
so we have these two results that are very like they go in analogy to the bipartite case

19:46.320 --> 19:53.680
but one thing that's a little bit extra here is a clear definition of a multi-partite free

19:53.680 --> 20:02.960
assembled so again free assembled is one that can be can be created using only free operations

20:02.960 --> 20:07.680
and since we study non-classicality the free assembled will be a classical assembled

20:07.680 --> 20:14.000
or how people usually call it in the literature so an unsteerable assembled and actually there are a

20:14.000 --> 20:19.360
lot of definitions of a free multi-partite assemblage in the literature the most general

20:19.360 --> 20:25.680
that you will find is this one so it's that an assemblage is free if it can be decomposed

20:25.680 --> 20:30.880
like this so we have this probability distribution for Alice's and we have the state for Bob

20:31.440 --> 20:35.760
and actually in the most general definition there are no constraints on this probability

20:35.760 --> 20:42.880
distribution here so for example this probability distribution is allowed to be signaling for each

20:42.960 --> 20:51.200
lambda as long as the signaling average is out when we sum over all lambdas so such a thing is

20:51.200 --> 20:57.760
usually referred to as fine tuning that we have this kind of undesired effect for for each lambda

20:57.760 --> 21:06.320
but then it's average is out and it can be seen as problematic from some perspectives and there

21:06.320 --> 21:11.760
are a few different problems that arise for this definition maybe I will not really go into detail

21:11.760 --> 21:20.720
here but we don't have any of these problems in our LOSR approach so if we look at the set of

21:20.720 --> 21:28.800
free operations again in our LOSR approach well it's pretty clear that a1 prime depends only

21:28.800 --> 21:36.240
on x1 prime and lambda and a2 prime depends only on x2 prime and lambda so this probability

21:36.240 --> 21:43.840
to distribution in our case will factorize so in our LOSR approach every assemblage is one

21:43.840 --> 21:50.000
that decomposes like this so we don't really have any problems with signaling or any of the ones

21:50.000 --> 21:56.800
that appear for this more general definition okay so that's pretty much it let me just make

21:56.800 --> 22:02.880
some final remarks and so what I just presented to you was a resource theory of common cost

22:02.880 --> 22:10.000
assemblages for bipartite and multi-partite EPR scenarios and it was motivated by a clear

22:10.000 --> 22:16.320
causal interpretation of an EPR scenario that is a common cost that Alice and Bob share

22:18.160 --> 22:24.800
thanks to this causal interpretation this notion is a unified notion of common cost resources

22:25.520 --> 22:31.360
and it works for example for EPR scenarios but also for Bell scenarios and entanglement

22:31.760 --> 22:38.560
we showed that testing convergence is numerically tractable which is very useful if you want to

22:38.560 --> 22:46.240
study the preorder of resources and we use this result to show some interesting properties of

22:46.240 --> 22:52.320
the preorder and finally in the multi-partite case we have a well-motivated definition of a free

22:52.320 --> 22:58.960
multi-partite assemblage so thank you for your attention and I would be very glad to take any

22:59.680 --> 23:10.800
questions okay thank you data for your talk now we have some minutes for questions or comments

23:10.800 --> 23:15.440
if somebody makes a question please can you take this

23:15.680 --> 23:17.680
can you check

23:28.480 --> 23:35.040
yes um okay thank you and thank you for the talk I think it was very well

23:35.600 --> 23:42.080
presented and I am a little confused about the general picture of what you're doing

23:42.480 --> 23:50.560
um so okay let me try to state what I think is your project and let me relate it to some issues

23:50.560 --> 23:58.480
that I that seem to be relevant okay so if I understand you correctly you first presented

23:58.480 --> 24:05.360
the view of Schrodinger according to which there seems to be some type of action matter distance

24:05.360 --> 24:13.360
in a typical EPR scenario and you said correctly that EPR themselves and in particular Einstein

24:13.920 --> 24:20.000
had this view that well it might be that in reality quantum mechanics is not complete

24:20.000 --> 24:27.840
and that the quantum state somehow reveals it's about the knowledge of Alice or Bob

24:28.800 --> 24:35.520
okay that perhaps there is something more to the quantum state and in your case there seems

24:35.520 --> 24:44.080
to be a reference to a common cause in the past of Alice's and Bob's labs okay and I just seem to

24:44.080 --> 24:54.000
think that you can recover locality by this way of thinking and the problem I see is that well

24:54.000 --> 25:02.960
that is precisely the starting point with Bell's work and with his theorem and his question was well

25:02.960 --> 25:11.600
can we recover locality by doing something like whatever Einstein thought and his theorem is uh

25:12.160 --> 25:19.760
no you cannot do it you cannot have a local theory and here's why because any theory that

25:19.760 --> 25:25.520
that is uh non-local in this sense is going to make this uh inequalities is going to satisfy

25:25.520 --> 25:32.000
these inequalities we go we check uh time and again we we notice that the inequalities are

25:32.000 --> 25:38.480
violated and the the consequence seems to be that well any non-local theory is not going to work

25:39.040 --> 25:47.520
so so let me know what am I missing and how is your yeah so you're not really missing anything

25:47.520 --> 25:54.000
so let me start with your bell comparison so this is a bell type experiment right we have

25:54.000 --> 25:59.120
a common cause and we have two parties and they make measurements so now if this common cause is

25:59.120 --> 26:05.600
classical just by studying this causal structure so the fact that you have a common cause and you

26:05.600 --> 26:11.840
have inputs and outputs you can derive bell inequalities and now if the common cause is

26:11.920 --> 26:20.640
classical you can just like the the upper bound on the chsh inequalities too if the common cause

26:20.640 --> 26:27.600
is quantum it's two times the square root of two and if it is allowed to be anything more but

26:27.600 --> 26:34.000
there is still non signaling between the parties we have the pr box right so it goes up to four now

26:34.000 --> 26:42.880
it's the same with epr scenarios so if this is a classical common cause then the assembler is free

26:42.880 --> 26:49.840
and it's classical so as you said it kind of recovers the locality in in this sense but if

26:49.840 --> 26:57.280
it's quantum we get assemblages that cannot be explained that's with classical physics okay but

26:57.280 --> 27:03.200
then you must somehow be violating one of the assumptions of bell theorem right you must be

27:03.200 --> 27:09.760
violating settings independence either by postulating some sort of common cause between

27:09.760 --> 27:14.800
the state of lambda the the common cause and the settings of Alice and Bob or you're assuming something

27:14.800 --> 27:22.880
like retrocausal theory in which Alice's settings somehow influence the the state of the the system

27:22.880 --> 27:30.480
the common cause so for example here you can like put a box and you can make Bob make the

27:30.480 --> 27:37.920
measurement and then it will be just like a standard bell scenario right so one way of looking

27:37.920 --> 27:46.080
at an assemblage would be to see whether if Bob makes a measurement we violate a bell inequality

27:49.840 --> 27:55.920
and like you could do so with the shared state is entangled right but if it's classical then you

27:55.920 --> 28:02.160
cannot so you have to draw this line between what's classical and what's non-classical and

28:02.160 --> 28:11.680
both for bells scenarios and for EPR scenarios this line can be decided based on the nature of

28:11.680 --> 28:16.720
the common cause so if a common cause is classical then you will not violate a bell inequality but

28:16.720 --> 28:23.680
if it's quantum so with the shared entangled state then you will get some some quantumness in this

28:23.680 --> 28:36.400
scenario. Thank you. Does it answer your question or I'm not quite sure? Perhaps we should let other

28:36.400 --> 28:43.520
people make questions and perhaps another time we can continue. Okay thank you. There is another

28:43.520 --> 28:57.280
question from Federico Farlic but we have Federico. Yes thanks Beata for this very nice talk I wanted

28:57.280 --> 29:03.680
to ask you whether there is a simple explanation of why you have a pre-order and not a partial order

29:03.680 --> 29:13.440
or even a lattice as it happens in other resource theories? Not really so one thing is

29:18.160 --> 29:26.560
so the structure of the pre-order here is very much inherent to the structure of the pre-order

29:26.560 --> 29:32.000
for LOSR entanglement so for example in LOCC entanglement what you have is that

29:32.800 --> 29:39.360
the conversions between states with an as the value of fee targets smaller you can actually

29:39.360 --> 29:47.200
convert the states into a different partially entangled states. In the LOSR entanglement it's

29:47.200 --> 29:53.760
not the case so it's already in the LOSR entanglement that you have family of incomparable resources

29:54.480 --> 30:02.080
so for the case of assemblages this case is it just translates from the states to assemblages.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.320
Okay thanks.

30:09.280 --> 30:15.200
Okay there is another question or

30:15.200 --> 30:26.640
it's not we thanks to Beata again for the talk and the people to participate.
