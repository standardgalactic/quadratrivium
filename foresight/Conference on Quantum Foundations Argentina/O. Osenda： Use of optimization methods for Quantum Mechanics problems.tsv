0	5440	So good morning in this second day of the conference of Quantum Foundations.
6000	11520	So we have today the pleasure of the first talk by Omar Asenda,
11520	14240	who is from Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba in Argentina.
14800	19360	He will speak about the use of optimization methods for quantum mechanics problems.
19360	22080	So for one, please, Omar.
22560	32240	Okay, thank you. Mariela, welcome. Congratulations to all the organizers for, well, finally,
34560	45440	that the 10th edition of this conference finally has, well, it's taking place.
46400	54640	And thank you for the opportunity to address some colleagues in these times.
56720	63680	Actually, I usually prepare too much material for the talk.
63680	67600	So I have planned this talk in two parts.
68320	76320	I don't know how I will use exactly the time, but depending on how much time
77200	86080	how fast I can go, well, I will cover the transmission of quantum states and maybe
87200	93520	something about field body problems, but mainly the talk is about the transmission of
94240	102080	quantum states. Usually what this work is actually is not published yet.
103120	110240	You can find it in the archive, but it's an ongoing collaboration with Paulo Serra and
110240	121200	Alessandro Ferron. And well, we can start thinking what is exactly a quantum state
122160	131280	transfer, what we can think a quantum channel is made of.
132720	143200	15 years ago, talking about a change of quantum systems, replicas of
144160	152640	a quantum system that are interacting between them and, well, that can be used as
154160	160960	a wire to transmit information. Well, 15 years ago, this was a major dream. It was the
163120	171280	realm of theoretical physics. Today, there are a lot of technical advances that made
172240	178800	the transmission of quantum state possible in solar state implementation, that is
182560	189920	the setting that many people think about. In quantum state implementations, for example,
190720	199920	the wire that will transmit the quantum state will be, for example, a chain of quantum dots or
201280	211600	a chain of superconducting qubits, etc. Ideally, the wire is used to
212720	220640	transmit quantum information from a sender to a receiver. The sender ideally will
220960	230080	prepare some quantum state, the information that they want to send. The channel
232080	243120	should be initialized to a simple state, and the receiver will perform some
244000	255040	measurements to retrieve the information that the sender sent to him. Obviously, this is
257520	265200	a quite complicated problem if the Hamiltonian of the system is a many-bodied Hamiltonian,
265760	278720	and the interactions are, well, long-range, etc. Most people think, usually, in very simple systems,
279360	287920	in particular, many times the problem is not solved in the whole human space, so
288080	301520	usually, the Hamiltonian has some symmetries that allow to restrict the dynamic of the problem
303600	314640	to use a sub-space of the whole human space. There are many protocols. A protocol is
315200	330080	a recipe to prepare the state, how the system evolves in time, and finally, how the information is
330080	343600	retrieved at the other stream of the chain. Many people is familiarized with the X-axis Hamiltonian,
343680	351760	that is a spin Hamiltonian that has only interaction, for example, in the plane,
352800	362880	is an isotropic Hamiltonian. To fix the idea, many people think that the initial state is prepared
362880	371440	in the first site of the channel. The rest of the chain is initialized in a simple state
372240	382000	that, depending on the physics of the problem, is maybe the ground state of the system.
384720	394640	The time evolution, obviously, is produced with some unitary time evolution operator,
394640	405920	because, at least in principle, the simplest way to analyze these problems is using unitary
406720	415520	time evolution. Obviously, it is possible to consider an open chain, an open quantum system,
415520	426720	but the problem becomes almost intractable. At least if the length of the chain
428320	441200	will be around the 10 spins or things like that. This is just to fix ideas. There are many forms,
441200	450240	many protocols, but this is the simplest. An initial state, and in the simplest protocol,
450240	458320	the time evolution is given by the autonomous Hamiltonian of the chain. There is no external
458320	471600	forcing, so, actually, the time evolution is the simplest time evolution operator,
471600	481520	is the exponential of the Hamiltonian. It is possible to use the spectral decomposition
481520	494320	of the operator. A lot of things are easy to calculate. Even more, if this is the initial
494320	500080	state and the Hamiltonian is for magnetic and the zero state is the random state,
501120	508400	this Hamiltonian commutes with the total magnetization, so the dynamics keeps,
509360	521120	is restricted to the one excitation subspace, so the dimension of the actual
522480	533440	hillar space is basically the size of the chain. If the chain has n spins, then the dimension of
533520	541360	the hillar space in the one excitation subspace, the dimension of the hillar space,
541360	556640	the subspace is just n. Many times, the quantity that is used to quantify how good, how successful
557600	566160	is the protocol, is called the fidelity, the transmission fidelity, that can be calculated
566160	575920	regularly using the amplitude probability that an excitation is
578800	584720	transferred from the first side of the chain to the last side of the chain. This quantity is
585680	592480	quite easy to calculate in the sense that it's just an expectation value of the
594480	603200	time evolution operator. This particular formula can be deduced because to
603440	617440	quantify the channel, usually what is used is an average over all the initial state that can be
617440	629440	prepared. Just to fix some ideas, many times, well, it is interesting to consider that the chain
630000	645280	could be in a disorder state. The couplings maybe cannot be fixed to some desired value.
646240	655840	Maybe there are defects in the fabrication process, or just like every
657920	667840	non-standard system, it is quite difficult to fix all the couplings, etc. And this
668800	679120	is, for example, how it is possible, for example, to control the time evolution of the problem.
679120	687360	Sometimes it is useful just to consider that the transmission process is forced or controlled
687360	696160	by applying some external control fractions. Why? Because many times, the natural time evolution,
696160	706000	the autonomous time evolution is not sufficient to achieve a good transmission. Obviously,
706000	713600	the idea is that if the fidelity reaches the unity, well, the transmission is perfect,
713600	727840	all values of FT superior to 0.999 are considered interesting, but obviously,
728960	740960	depending on the Hamiltonian, how these chain coupling coefficients are chosen, etc., this
741040	751760	fidelity could be a fiber that is lower rather lower than the unit. So, it is useful sometimes to
751760	760880	consider a forced evolution. But the problem of the forced evolution is obviously controlling
761840	771920	a nanoscopic, a microscopic quantum system is quite difficult. Many times, it is impossible
771920	781120	to control the system with smooth functions. There are a lot of considerations that can be
781200	791120	made, advising against using a control evolution. Many times, it is the only option, because the
791840	803520	interactions cannot be chosen, but are fixed for some fundamental interaction. But the force
804480	812480	or the control evolution of a quantum system is quite difficult. In particular, if the system
813520	827040	doesn't have a lot of symmetries or the dynamics cannot be kept in a sub-space,
827760	834160	it is quite difficult to calculate this control evolution, because obviously,
836000	846480	the control functions shall be obtained using an optimization method. So,
846480	857360	anyway, for the excess Hamiltonian, people have been working in this area for many years.
857360	864080	So, there are a lot of interesting results, like perfect quantum state transmission is achievable,
865040	876400	choosing particular values for the quantities j, ji, or these quantities, choosing some very
876400	883840	particular values. It is possible to achieve using autonomous time evolution. It is possible to
883840	892880	achieve perfect quantum state transmission, basically for any initial state. Even more,
893040	905520	it can be proved that the dynamics behaves like a specular inversion in the quantum chain. So,
905520	912800	the thing that you prepare in the half of the chain will be reflected at some time in the other
912800	921280	half of the chain. It is very interesting. There are regimes where a most perfect quantum state
921280	932480	transmission can be achieved just using an almost homogeneous quantum state. All the coefficients,
932480	943040	all the strange coefficients are equal, except a pair or maybe four exchange coupling coefficients
943040	950880	will be chosen different, and a very good quantum state transmission can be achieved.
950880	963920	So, why the XX Hamiltonian was studied so intensely? Why there are so many
964480	974640	results? Basically, because of this fundamental fact, it's quite easy to go in the XX Hamiltonian
974640	988880	from a given, I can choose the couplings and, well, I can calculate the, it is possible to
988880	997840	calculate the spectrum of the system, or it is possible to prescribe the spectrum that I want
997840	1006080	to have for some Hamiltonian, and there is an unique way to calculate the exchange coupling
1006080	1015440	distribution. All the exchange coupling distribution is, in this case, always in the case where
1015760	1026400	we are dealing with the one excitation, some space, it's a one-to-one relationship, okay?
1026400	1032560	I can provide, for example, a very simple spectrum, for example, I can choose that the
1032560	1044880	spectrum of the system consists in eigenvalues that can be chosen, they are equal spaces between them,
1045440	1053200	okay? That sounds like a system that is quite possible that the whole contribution from the
1053200	1063040	eigenvalues cannot be constructed at some time, so I can choose this spectrum and the
1064320	1069520	coefficients can be calculated one by one in a unique way.
1070080	1081920	Obviously, most quantum spinchase doesn't have this property, in particular, the
1081920	1091680	case in the Hamiltonian doesn't have this property. It is impossible to prescribe a spectrum,
1092400	1101280	and in that way, obtain the coefficients that produce that spectrum, okay?
1103200	1115200	Well, as anybody that has found sometimes the better answer to the relationship between the
1115200	1126240	spectrum in the case in the Hamiltonian is, right, the obscure. Any way, well, or more precisely,
1126240	1138080	because of this, many words focus in the control transmission in the case in the Hamiltonian,
1138800	1143200	because, well, a lot of people thought that it was
1145920	1159760	easier to control a quantum chain, a homogeneous quantum chain obeying the case in the Hamiltonian,
1159760	1169200	and, well, controlling, designing very sophisticated control courses can be found that maybe the
1169200	1178240	transmission time, the transmission in the time in which the receiver can retrieve the
1178240	1186480	information sent by the sender, well, that time is around, obviously, if j is equal to 1,
1187040	1200800	there are most no energy units, so it is natural to measure the transmission time in
1203440	1212080	units of the length of the chain. That is the only, okay, if j is exactly equal to 1,
1212080	1225200	this is a very good unit to measure the time. I didn't say it, but another interesting quantity
1225920	1235520	or another interesting feature of the change with the excess Hamiltonian is that here,
1235520	1246960	it is very easy to show that the transmission time, the transmission time that the receiver
1247600	1256240	should weigh to measure and obtain a very good fidelity of transmission, that time is bounded,
1257120	1264960	but by the time that is consistent with the quantum speed limit, so
1267600	1277680	it is very easy to think that this Hamiltonian has a sound velocity for the spin waves and that
1278480	1287920	spin and that velocity is related to the quantum speed limit. In the case in the Hamiltonian,
1287920	1298640	there is no simple way to assess which is the time scale with convenience to measure or to
1299360	1315840	try to produce a very good transmission. So, what can be done with all this? Well,
1316800	1324640	actually, we said that this quantity, the probability that an excitation can be transmitted
1324640	1333840	from the first side to the last side is a quantity that depends on the spectrum and on the sound
1333840	1341840	coefficients of the eigenvalue, sorry, of the eigenvector, so this quantity can be optimized.
1343920	1354320	I can think that this is a complicated function that depends, obviously, on all the coefficients
1355520	1368560	that determine the Hamiltonian, so maybe I can choose somehow the exchange couplings and
1369600	1376320	using that exchange coupling, I can calculate the spectrum, the eigenvalues and calculate this.
1376960	1380560	So, if I can devise a method to explore
1384240	1399200	all the large number of values of the z-coefficient, maybe I can find the largest value
1400000	1413360	for this quantity, for some time that I can choose somehow. So, it is obvious that
1415680	1421360	this function, the amplitude of probability that an excitation goes from the first side to the
1421360	1431440	last side is a quantity that depends on all the coefficients. In a general change, there will be
1431440	1444480	nj coefficients, n exchange coefficients, so for a change, for example, of 50 spins,
1445280	1459840	it is a rather large space, a parameter space to explore. So, it is hopeless to try to
1460640	1472880	investigate the whole space in a completely random way, a space of 50 dimensions is to be to explore,
1472880	1487040	so maybe the exploration can be done using some kind of random walk, but it must be a
1487040	1495120	directed random walk in the parameter space. Well, fortunately, there are a lot of
1495360	1505520	methods, but the people in the statistical mechanics area have devised a lot of
1507600	1518080	methods to explore a rather large parameter space, and one of these methods is the
1518640	1527440	pivot methods that are used for global optimization. So, pivot methods are basically a good way to
1527440	1538320	generate a random walk that explores, in an intelligent way, a given parameter space. Obviously,
1538400	1547600	this is an example, an after-example of a search conducted over a two-dimensional parameter space.
1548320	1561680	This is a typical chart flow that can be found in all the papers in pivot methods are paper from
1561680	1576240	the 90s, so instead of using some colorful cartoons, it is most common to find chart flows like this,
1576240	1588320	because chart flows are the way to express an algorithm. I don't want to enter, but I mean,
1589280	1598000	any pivot method, any method can be used that is useful to search in a large
1599520	1606960	parameter space, it can be used to perform exactly the same that we did. So, for example,
1609040	1615760	you have 10 more minutes, so to finish everything. Thank you, thank you. Well,
1615920	1628560	this is, for example, how can a search for the coefficient can be done. This is a short
1630080	1640960	chain, but it is useful because the chains that are used are termed centrosymmetric because
1641040	1649440	there are symmetry between the first exchange coefficient and the last, and the optimization
1649440	1659440	method proceeds, the pivot method proceeds like by looking in a particular hyper queue
1659440	1665520	that contains all the possible values of the exchange coefficients. The problem with the
1665520	1680160	Heisenberg Hamiltonian has, there is not a simple way to bound the values of the
1680160	1690560	exchange coefficient that I need to use to achieve the transmission for some time, because, again,
1690640	1700000	the spectrum is quite complicated. We proceeded by looking at the best possible values of J that
1700000	1709360	provided a very good, or the best, the best fidelity of transmission in a small hyper queue,
1709360	1720320	but then we will, we proceed to enlarge the hyper queue and we go from some exchange
1720320	1730000	capital distributions that are obtained using some particular transmission time,
1730640	1740880	and this is what we found after a lot of numerical effort, but, effectively, we found
1742400	1752320	very good, near-perfect quantum state transmission for spin chains of, basically,
1753280	1760560	the length that we wanted, and for the arrival times of our chosen.
1762080	1772400	So the pivot method is able to find the necessary exchange couplings to produce
1773040	1779680	very good or near-perfect quantum state transmission in the Heisenberg Hamiltonian.
1779760	1792480	That is a result that was not known previously, but obviously the way to look for this exchange
1792480	1804240	coupling is clearly the result of a random walk that is performed, it's a direct random walk,
1804240	1813200	but maybe we can think that, well, the probability of transmission is quite high,
1813200	1822240	it's quite interesting, if you look at in this inset, all the transmission probabilities can be
1823120	1832960	made, well, basically, are bigger than 0.999 if we want to
1835760	1846400	that kind, that quality of transmission, but, obviously, once we get the exchange
1846400	1857440	coupling distribution, we wanted to understand if the solutions, this solution, have some physics
1858720	1866640	or are just results that the only thing that can be said about them is that they provide
1866640	1878720	a very good quantum state transmission. So we looked for the probability of having a good
1878720	1888640	transmission, this is a typical time evolution, near the transmission time, these are the peaks
1888640	1901200	of the probability for different settings, we can design or use different arrival times,
1901200	1911040	so, for example, these are very short arrival times, the black curves, the red curves correspond to a
1911040	1918560	larger arrival time, the blue one a more larger arrival time, but
1922480	1929120	each one of these was calculated with a different exchange coupling distribution, but, well,
1930080	1941840	some of us have a strong background in scaling and that kind of property, so we scale the time
1941840	1949120	evolution of the probability and we found that, basically, it doesn't matter what is the time,
1949120	1955120	the arrival time, basically, the behavior around the arrival time is basically the same,
1955120	1968800	which is a quite neat result because the exchange coefficients that are used to
1970240	1978960	calculate the probability of arrival probability for a given time has nothing to do with
1979520	1989280	the another exchange coupling distribution, so, for example, it is possible to,
1993040	2003520	after some numerical experiments are done, it is possible to study what is the minimum size of
2003520	2012560	their per queue necessary to find where this exchange coupling can be found, this is that size,
2012560	2023440	for example, we can say that if we choose a larger arrival times, the strength of the
2024720	2030640	exchange coupling distribution, the maximum value of the exchange coupling distribution,
2030720	2040400	basically, decays in an exponential way, so, in a sense, we can say that for very large exchange,
2041600	2052240	sorry, for very large arrival time, basically, the chain will be, well, basically almost
2052240	2058480	homogeneous, but not exactly homogeneous, there is no need to have very different values
2059440	2076320	between the exchange coupling distribution, and, well, another way to qualify how good
2076320	2084080	are these exchange coupling distributions, for example, consider what the set of exchange
2084160	2094880	couplings have been obtained, well, what about adding some disorder if, well, looking at this
2096800	2105600	fiber is quite obvious that the probability, the transmission, the transfer,
2106560	2117520	the probability that is related to fidelity can be made as large as close to the unity as wanted,
2118160	2134080	but these values are stable if some disorder is produced, everything, maybe this transmission
2134080	2143440	under some disorder is completely destroyed or not, well, we consider some static disorder
2143440	2153520	applied to the chain, and we found that, well, the chain was able to sustain some disorder, so,
2154160	2166480	the, in some sense, the maximum found by the pyramid is rated well, because applying some disorder
2166480	2178880	can be thought like, well, making another stochastic search, another stochastic search around the
2178880	2190480	values that the people met found, but basically, we can say that the spin distribution are, well,
2191520	2200080	produced a very good, very, very good transmission, and that they are quite stable against
2201040	2211040	this disorder, so, as I said, I prepare a lot of material, but the conclusion of this part is,
2211040	2226240	we are almost in time, yeah, yeah, the conclusion, well, this, the physics near this new configuration,
2226320	2235920	this new change, is quite inspired, we want to study the physics, how the transmission is produced
2235920	2247440	in this change that has, that have the couplings, Tyler is specifically to produce a large,
2248400	2264320	a large fidelity of transmission, well, as a stochastic search, everything works fine, but we
2264320	2272960	don't know why, at least, well, in that moment, when we wrote the manuscript, we didn't have
2273920	2282400	clues why everything works so fine, I think that we now have some clues that we are exploring them,
2284400	2292240	this procedure will be successfully translated to another Hamiltonian, we are looking for that,
2292800	2307200	maybe there are other procedures to determine these couplings in another way, maybe there are,
2308480	2317200	because looking at the exchange couplings that are calculated, it is not obvious that they can be
2317280	2328400	translated in a, in a, in a simple formula, we are discussing also if some experimental implementation
2328400	2336240	can be made, well, and that's it, well, half a minute, okay, one minute and a half,
2338960	2345840	thank you very much, thank you Omar, so if someone has a, just a short question,
2346800	2348080	we can put it here,
2359680	2371120	so you mean the, the, of elements in mind, you studied the, the left, the chain,
2372080	2376720	and you did a search, sorry, you touched with the left, the chain, dependent on n?
2379920	2388640	Sorry, the communication was interrupted, but I couldn't hear the question, can you repeat, sorry,
2390720	2395120	if you did a search with the left, length of the chain, depending on the number n,
2396080	2402160	just to short something, but you mean small, the size of the system, you're,
2404160	2419600	no, we, we can study the chains from, from 10, 10 spins, 10 spins to 100, there is not an actual
2420320	2433680	limit, we stopped in 100 because, well, we didn't want to, to, to wait for the, for the results,
2433680	2447920	but there is not a practical limit, anyway, a chain of 100 sites is beyond, clearly it's beyond
2447920	2457920	any practical implementation at least for, for a few next years, but there is no an upper bound,
2458960	2464960	we stopped around 100, but we, for some new experiments, for some new results, we're
2465680	2474480	maybe looking at 120, yeah. Thank you. So we don't have, we don't have any comments,
2474480	2483680	so we thank again Nomar with a, with a clap, so we can change the vertical, thank you.
2484480	2492800	Thank you organizers, I want to thank you again, congratulations to achieve the 10th
2494880	2501440	conference and, and, and well, for a, for a very good acronym.
