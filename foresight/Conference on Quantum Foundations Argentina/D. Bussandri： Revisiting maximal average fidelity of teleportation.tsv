0	9320	We're glad to have Diego Boussandri from the Institute of Physics La Plata and the National
9320	16760	University of La Plata, and he will speak about revisiting maximal fidelity of teleportation.
16760	18680	Please Diego, go on.
18680	23200	Thank you very much for the presentation, so let's talk.
23200	26800	Diego, wait, your sound is low.
26800	29800	You could speak like this, and it's good, but if you could...
30560	32120	Now it's much better.
32120	33120	Thanks, thanks.
33120	34920	Please, go on.
34920	35920	Thank you, Ferri.
42240	43240	Sorry.
46160	47160	No problem, no problem.
47160	60960	Now, okay, let's talk about fidelity of teleportation.
60960	70960	This is a work we made with Madira Portesi and Anna Mast√©, and so what did we do?
70960	78960	We obtained the maximal average fidelity of teleportation, or the score of a given protocol,
78960	88960	for two situations, the standard quantum teleportation protocol characterized by a particular measurement.
88960	94960	So, one second.
94960	102960	Now, we calculate the maximal average fidelity of teleportation for the...
102960	104960	The sound is again low.
104960	108960	I don't know if everyone is...
108960	110960	What happened?
110960	111960	Now?
111960	113960	Yeah, now it's better.
113960	114960	Yes.
114960	115960	Sorry, sorry.
115960	117960	No problem.
117960	123960	Then we obtained the average fidelity in two situations, the standard quantum teleportation
123960	130960	protocol characterized by a particular measurement in which there is a projection onto the bell
130960	131960	bus.
131960	137960	And another protocol whose characteristic measurement is something in the middle between
137960	143960	the computational buses and the bell bus.
143960	153960	But our differential feature is that we calculate this for isotropic distribution of input states,
153960	156960	not only the heart measure.
156960	163960	I mean, not only your estates.
163960	175960	So, we are going to talk about useful protocols, namely, a protocol is useful when its average
175960	179960	fidelity is greater than the classical one.
179960	188960	Our key point, or our main result, is that when you take an average of a more general
188960	196960	distribution than the heart measure, the quantum teleportation protocol can be useful when your
196960	207960	resource has no quantum correlation, so even for a classical quantum aspect.
207960	211960	Well, what is the meaning of fidelity of teleportation?
211960	221960	Let us suppose that we have a protocol P producing output estates given by Roy out with the WTPI
221960	227960	for an input estates or a qubit estates given by row A.
227960	234960	And row A is characterized by its block vector T.
234960	235960	Okay.
235960	245960	And so, if you want to know how well the quantum teleportation was performed, you can quantify
245960	255960	the similarity between row A and the final output, calculating equation one.
255960	265960	But this measure depends basically on the input estates, I mean equation one.
265960	275960	So, we should take the average of your initial distribution of estates.
275960	288960	But now, let us suppose that we have the possibility to perform unitary operation over your final estates
288960	292960	in order to increase the fidelity.
292960	303960	So, let us suppose we have a protocol P producing row I, and then we perform unitary operation
303960	306960	over your conditional estates.
306960	316960	So, the similarity, the fidelity between your average fidelity, sorry, the a priori fidelity
316960	319960	would be writing as equation four.
319960	326960	And we can see that the red part of this measure does not depend on your unitary operations,
326960	329960	but the green one, yes.
329960	341960	So, if we want to maximize this quantity over your unitary operation, we should optimize only the green part.
341960	353960	So, for convenience, we will take the fidelity given by number six, a half fidelity, the green part of the average fidelity.
353960	362960	And in the future, we, in just in the future, we will maximize equation number six.
362960	372960	So, a simple question first before to continue is what is the best choice of the initial ensemble estates
372960	381960	if we want to study the capability or the ability or the ability of P to teleport arbitrary states.
381960	385960	A simple answer is the most random one.
385960	394960	This problem was first addressed by Hall, Michael Hall.
394960	405960	And, well, there's no unique answer to this, but a first approach is we should choose the probability measure
405960	412960	by the most symmetrical distance in the space of states.
412960	426960	So, if we now are talking about u-wits, we could talk about distribution within the block wall.
426960	434960	The first common one is the Hall measure that, you know, stands for the sphere of the block wall.
434960	447960	But also, more general, yes, more general ensemble of initial estates can be taken as, for example,
447960	458960	random, completely random mixed states within the block wall induced by the Hilbert Smith distance
458960	468960	and also the corresponding distribution to the Bure's distance.
468960	476960	So, we will compare our calculation in the quantum case with the classical case.
476960	481960	We will review, we should review first the classical teleportation protocol.
481960	493960	And it's a procedure that consists of a measurement over, directly over the system that you want to teleport.
493960	503960	And once you have the result of your measurement, you prepare an estate according to a guessing strategy.
503960	515960	Then you have two estates, first measurement, then preparing an estate according to the information that you have obtained with this measure.
515960	527960	This problem was already solved for the qubit case and isotropic distribution of input state, a general one, by Vidal.
527960	541960	And the solution is given by equation seven, that we have here the maximum classical, the maximum average fidelity of teleportation in the classical case.
541960	549960	So equation seven is the maximum over the measurements and the guessing strategies.
549960	563960	Two common examples that we could, we could address is the hall measure, then you obtain this famous result of two thirds.
563960	573960	And for example, for completely mixed estate in the block wall and you obtain a different result.
573960	579960	Now the quantum teleportation protocol consists of three qubits, A, B, and C.
579960	585960	Our aim is to teleport the estate of qubit E to the system C.
585960	597960	And the first step consists in preparing a joint estate, a joint estate in the systems B and C.
597960	606960	The second one, we should measure jointly over the systems A and B, obtaining conditional estates.
606960	626960	Once you have your result, you share your result to Bob, who applies the unitary confirmations in order to increase the average fidelity or the score of the protocol.
627960	650960	A common frame of example is when you prepare as a resource estates, as for the estate role, you prepare one of the bail estates, and you measure the bail basis in your second step.
650960	665960	So if you do that, you can always find unitary transformation having fidelity one, having the final output equal to the initial one.
665960	680960	But in general, if you take a general measure, a general fundamental measurement, and you prepare a random or an arbitrary resource estate role,
680960	702960	you obtain as conditional estates of your protocol raw CI, the following general expressions given by the marginal vectors and the covariant matrices of your measurements, states, your projections, and your resource estates.
702960	719960	So the conditional block vectors are given by equation nine. These vectors are before to apply the unitary transformation, the unitary correction.
719960	735960	So before to continue, we should define first the fully entangled fraction that is measure of quantum correlation in bipartite estates.
735960	747960	So for example, here raw is a general bipartite estate, and equation 10 stands for the correlation of this particular estate.
748960	766960	Why we define this? Because the quantum teleportation protocol has associated a fidelity, a maximum average fidelity, that is proportional to this fully entangled fraction.
766960	777960	So here we have the average fidelity for the measurement, the projection onto the bell basis.
777960	784960	And here we have the half measure, only pure estates.
784960	806960	So this is a general rule in quantum teleportation that states that if you have separable, for example, estates as a resource of the protocol, then your protocol is not useful, namely, you cannot overcome the classical fidelity with this particular protocol.
806960	819960	If you want to have a useful protocol, you should have entanglement in your resource.
819960	828960	But these results are always for the Hermitian, always for pure estates.
828960	844960	So now we will maximize the average fidelity in a more general situation considering an ensemble of initial estates that could include mixed estates.
844960	873960	So in order to do that, we should use the general expression we saw before, and we should calculate this scalar product between T that is the block vector that we want to copy with the a priori final conditional block vectors.
873960	889960	So the good news here is that the vector omega here in green does not depend on T, and the matrix A does not depend on T also.
889960	902960	So we could use the inequalities given in equation 13 to obtain the average fidelity.
902960	922960	But if we want to maximize the equation 14, we should maximize the trace of A because A has the rotations corresponding to the unitary operations.
922960	951960	But here we have another good news that is our optimization problem does not depend on the purity because the purity of your ensemble is concentrated here in number alpha given by equation 14.
952960	966960	So if you, you can, we can use the known solution for input estates.
967960	984960	So this is the general solution for the standard quantum teleportation protocol and considering a distribution, a random distribution of input estates.
984960	997960	Let us take now particular example, particular resource estates in order to see what happened with the average fidelity comparing with the classical one.
997960	1011960	Let us take now as a resource estates, a belt diagonal estates, so the new expression we will have is this one.
1011960	1021960	And if we take a Werner estate as the resource of the protocol, we have this average fidelity.
1021960	1039960	And the good news here is that if we take, for example, the random distribution of initial estates, the completely random distribution in the block wall induced by the Hilbert Smith norm, we can obtain the analytical spectrum.
1039960	1051960	So the question now is, is the protocol is useful only when the resource is entangled, so the quick answer is that no.
1052960	1057960	And we have this picture, this figure.
1057960	1062960	Here we have the average fidelity.
1062960	1070960	And then, and this part is correspond to separable Werner estates.
1071960	1087960	And the horizontal line correspond to the average, the classical average fidelity. So we have an entire range of separable estates overcoming the classical fidelity.
1087960	1099960	So we have a resource without entanglement and we are overcoming the classical, the classical average fidelity.
1100960	1108960	For a random distribution, a completely random distribution in the block wall.
1108960	1124960	So now the question is, if the quantum-discord like correlation are responsible or not for overcoming the classical average fidelity, because here we have this score, for example.
1124960	1130960	We have quantum correlation, we have separable estates, but there is quantum-discord.
1130960	1135960	And again, the answer is no.
1135960	1153960	And in order to see this, we will take a classical quantum, build the diagonal estates, the expression of the average fidelity given by the question 17.
1153960	1158960	And it corresponds to this, to this curve.
1158960	1170960	We have again an entire range of resource estates, classical quantum resource estates overcoming the classical, the classical fidelity.
1170960	1173960	So now the question is, what's happened here?
1173960	1198960	And in order to answer this, we consider another protocol that whose characteristics measurement, whose characteristic measurement is something, is a von Neumann measurement, that it is in the middle between the computational basis and the bell basis.
1198960	1209960	So in this new protocol, we can take off the entanglement of the measurement and see what happens.
1209960	1212960	The expression is this one.
1212960	1219960	Here we have the estates in which we will project the measurement.
1219960	1228960	We can quantify the entanglement only with one number, Cn.
1228960	1232960	And what is the time?
1232960	1239960	And we can solve this problem only for bell diagonal resource.
1239960	1249960	And I said, solve the problem is we could maximize the average fidelity.
1249960	1264960	And if we consider the hard measure, if we consider the hard measure, namely only pure estates as initial estates of the protocol.
1264960	1278960	Here we have the estates, the bell diagonal estates that are not useful depending on the measurement.
1278960	1292960	So when the measurement is the bell basis, sorry, here we should take Cn equal to 1.
1292960	1297960	In this situation, we are in a standard quantum teleportation protocol.
1298960	1314960	We see that if you do not have entanglement, so you can do anything because these estates are corresponding to an unusual protocol.
1314960	1325960	But we can see that if we take off the entanglement of the measurement, this volume of this set increases.
1325960	1337960	And if your measurement has no quantum correlation, has no correlation at all, as for example for the computational basis that is this case.
1337960	1344960	So you have always your protocol will be not useful.
1344960	1358960	But when you consider, for example, an ensemble of a completely random initial estates, the entire block ball, the situation change.
1358960	1373960	And you have this picture in which we have here the Eberner estates as a resource and these codes correspond to take off the entanglement.
1373960	1380960	Here Cn is equal to 1 and here Cn is equal to 0.
1380960	1385960	This horizontal line corresponds to the classical protocol.
1385960	1402960	So we have here a lot of situations in which you can overcome the classical fidelity and not always for the bell basis.
1404960	1416960	This is the same picture as before, but considering another resource, a classical quantum bell diagonal estate.
1416960	1434960	And we see the same because every line here corresponds to a protocol with a measurement less correlated with a less correlated measurement.
1434960	1450960	And we see that the most important feature of a general protocol is the correlation in the measurement because if you do not have any correlation in your measurement,
1450960	1467960	so you cannot find a resource estate in order to overcome the classical fidelity.
1467960	1475960	And well, I think that's all thanks for listening.
1475960	1478960	Thanks Diego, thanks Diego for this talk.
1478960	1495960	Now, if there are some questions, please let me know that right in in the chat or you can just jump in and do it.
