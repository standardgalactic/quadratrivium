0	12360	Okay, we are back with the next speaker of this morning session, who is Carlos Gerardo
12360	21440	Czepelewski of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and he will speak about on super
21440	25360	deterministic rejections of settings independence.
25360	27760	Please Carlos, go on.
27760	33600	Thank you Federico, and thank you to all the organizers of this conference on quantum
33600	36100	foundations.
36100	43400	I'm very grateful to be here and to be able to share with you work that I find particularly
43400	45600	interesting.
45600	51880	This work was made with collaboration with Elia Sokon and Ernest Sudarski, who are also
51880	63240	doing the call, perhaps even in the questions they can offer their insights.
63240	72440	Okay, this work is going to be published next year in the British Journal for the Philosophy
72440	74680	of Science.
74680	80320	So okay, as a way of introduction, let me say a little bit about the motivation of this
80320	84960	work.
84960	90120	Because of the presence, the existence of Bell's theorem, and the fact that we have
90120	97040	performed many, many times the relevant experiments related to such a theorem, it seems that there
97040	103200	is some, there are some non-local features in the universe.
103200	112000	And we will see the details in a minute, but as an introduction, let me just say that
112000	119160	if one wants to avoid this conclusion, it seems that possibly the only way to do so
119160	126360	is to deny one of the assumptions in the theorem called settings independence.
126360	132920	It might be that there are other assumptions in the theorem, but I would say that in most
132920	139280	cases, I do not see any way of denying the other type of assumptions, or in general,
139280	147920	I do not see other important assumptions that appear in the theorem.
147920	154400	Then the work of non-locality becomes the work of seeing what reasons do we have in
154400	160280	favor of settings independence, and what reasons do we have to believe in some of the ways
160280	163280	of denying such an assumption.
163280	172920	And in working on this evaluation of arguments, we stumbled upon a very interesting model
172920	177040	that is going to be the subject of today's talk.
177040	181840	Okay, so this is the structure of what we are going to do today.
181840	185600	We're going to do a quick overview of Bell's theorem.
185600	189320	Then we will move to discuss the assumption of settings independence.
189320	194440	We will pay special attention to what reasons do we have to believe that something like
194440	200720	settings independence is true, and what kind of reasons or what kind of models might be
200720	205760	able to still say that such an assumption is incorrect.
205760	213240	Finally, we're going to introduce the local pilot wave, this model that I think is really
213240	214240	interesting.
214600	219440	So let's start with Bell's theorem and a very quick overview.
219440	225600	I think that most of the people in this call and in this conference are familiar with the
225600	231240	theorem, but it will be a good exercise to go into the overall structure of the theorem
231240	233040	and what it states.
233040	240600	So we have a typical Bell type experiment where we prepare an ensemble of two particles
240600	244080	and we send them to distant locations.
244080	249360	In one location we have Alice's lab and in the other we have Bob's lab.
249360	257440	The capital A and capital B stand for the results of the experiments that each one performs.
257440	260480	The results only can be up and down.
260480	270360	Alice and Bob are measuring the spin of the system that is sent towards them.
270360	275320	Of course, I don't know if I mentioned this, but the ensemble is of systems that we would
275320	279360	describe singlets in quantum mechanics.
279360	284560	Lowercase A and lowercase B stand for the settings that Alice and Bob use, for example
284560	291640	the angle by which they put the Steng-Erlach or another measuring device they are using.
291640	296760	And lambda is going to be a description, a complete description of the system that Alice
296760	298160	and Bob are measuring.
298160	302560	So we are interested in this experimental setup.
302560	310160	And Bell's theorem assumes two things regarding this general setup.
310160	314480	The first thing is called local causality.
314480	321640	And the idea of local causality is that suppose we have two distant regions and suppose that
321640	332360	we have a complete specification of whatever is happening in a slide of the past hyperverse
332360	346040	surface of this first region where something happens, a bevel kite occurs, some event occurs.
346040	352640	And the idea of local causality is that if I have information regarding sigma and this
352640	358240	information is complete, then whatever is happening outside in that other distant region
358240	362840	must be irrelevant.
362840	369360	In other words, the probability of whatever is happening in the first region must be independent
369360	372200	of whatever happens in another region.
372200	379680	Because I have conditionalised on sigma.
379680	384640	In the theorem, this assumption takes the form of factorizability.
384640	389760	I'm just going to assume that local causality implies factorizability for the purposes of
389760	391440	this talk.
391440	396360	So the idea is that the probability of Alice and Bob once we have the measuring settings
396360	399280	and the state of lambda, it goes like this.
399280	402240	We can factorise the probabilities.
402240	411120	The other assumption, and let me just state it, we will come back to it in a moment.
411120	417720	The assumption is that the distribution over this complete specification of the system
417720	423240	that Alice and Bob are going to measure is independent of the settings that Alice and
423240	430480	Bob use to measure their respective particles.
430480	437960	So Bell's theorem says that if one assumes factorizability and assumes settings independence,
437960	443920	then the expectation value for the product of the results of Alice and Bob, which is
443920	449800	this, is going to obey the inequality.
449800	453080	This is a particular inequality that can be derived.
453080	457760	There are many others that can be derived.
457760	464920	The interesting thing, so far Bell's theorem just is a derivation of this type of inequalities,
464920	469560	but it becomes interesting when one notices that according to quantum mechanics, this
469560	475520	combination of expectation values should be equal to two times the square root of two
475520	481040	and not less or equal than two.
481040	488000	We have performed the relevant experiments and we always find that quantum mechanics
488000	490080	seems to be right.
490080	495200	So the conclusion seems to be that, first, that no local theory can reproduce the predictions
495200	501040	of quantum mechanics and because of the experiments, it seems that the world has some non-local
501040	502040	features.
503040	508240	Okay, that is the overview of Bell's theorem.
508240	520040	Now we go to describe this assumption of settings independence and why it would be, why we would
520040	523200	consider it a reasonable assumption.
523200	528320	So as I said, the assumption is very simple to state.
528320	534880	It says that the distribution of the lambdas is going to be independent of the settings
534880	538960	that Alice and Bob select.
538960	545840	Something that I forgot to mention is that in the experimental setup we are imagining.
545840	548800	We want to be as general as we can.
548800	554760	So the idea would be that each time we prepare a system in a singlet, we are not going to
554760	563680	assume that there is a unique, complete description that is appropriate for that situation.
563680	569320	At much, we are assuming that each time we prepare a system in a singlet, we have a distribution
569320	573120	over the states of lambda.
573120	579800	And well, then settings independence is the idea that this distribution of whatever is
579800	587400	really happening is independent of how Alice and Bob measure the system.
587400	593760	Two comments regarding some confusions that have a reason regarding this assumption.
593760	598880	The first one is that this assumption has nothing to do with the free will of either
598880	600800	Alice or Bob.
600800	606840	There is a long tradition of people being confused because of this and there is even
606840	614640	theorems regarding the free will of the particles involved.
614640	615800	That seems to be a confusion.
615800	620720	It's easy to see that it is a confusion when one realizes that this is just an assumption
620720	626560	regarding the statistical character of the distribution of lambda.
626560	632440	Another confusion has to do with how to understand the lambda that appears at this moment.
633360	638520	The thing is that lambda at this point must be understood as the complete description of
638520	644760	the singlet of the system that we have prepared and that we call the singlet.
644760	649560	This is before I mentioned when I was talking about the assumption of local causality that
649560	656040	there is this complete specification in the past of region.
656040	660560	And some people think that lambda should be understood as this complete specification
660560	667480	of the hyper-surface in the past of region.
667480	670360	But in the theorem, lambda is not that.
670360	678800	Lambda is just the complete specification of the system that Alice and Bob are measuring.
678800	684680	Why would someone believe that an assumption like setting independence is reasonable?
684680	690800	The answer is that we have performed the relevant experiments and we have used a lot
690800	698640	of methods to randomize how we choose either A and B.
698640	702400	So we have used random number generators.
702400	704360	We have used the digits of pi.
704360	708600	We have used information coming from distant quasars.
708600	715720	We have used even stranger things like the binary strings that can be extracted from
715720	722080	information of popular movies and TV shows.
722080	727280	For example, we have used information coming from the movies of Star Trek and Monty Python
727280	728800	and the Holy Grail.
728800	734920	And we have used that strings of binary digits to select the settings that Alice and Bob
734920	736920	are using.
736920	744840	And finally, we have even used inputs from a lot of people to perform these experiments.
744840	745840	Why is this relevant?
745840	754080	Well, the idea is that by choosing the settings randomly, we are, in effect, erasing any kind
754080	760160	of correlations that we might expect that are present between the settings that we are
760160	769040	using and the state of lambda.
769040	779960	In the absence of some reason to believe that the correlation must be preserved, we think
779960	786400	that these kind of processes ensure us that the settings are being chosen randomly.
786400	792200	I hope that that is the main reason why we think that something like settings independence
792200	793720	is a good idea.
793720	800800	And as it might be obvious to some of you, it might not be obvious to some of you, but
800800	806680	an assumption like settings independence is present each time we perform an experiment
806680	813040	in the sense that we assume that how we are measuring something must be independent of
813040	816560	the system we are measuring.
816560	819440	Let me be precise.
819440	827040	We need to assume that it is possible to make those measurements in a way that is independent
827040	830720	of the system we are trying to measure, okay?
830720	831720	Okay.
831720	832720	That's good.
832720	833720	Okay.
833720	838960	Still, there are two possible ways of denying settings independence.
838960	846560	The first one is to assume a retrocosal model and to assume that it is the selection of
846560	855440	the settings by Alice and Bob that causes changes in the lambdas that we have prepared.
855440	860560	So the idea would be something like what is depicted in this diagram.
860560	866800	The idea would be that we prepare the singlet state and it moves towards Alice's lab, for
866800	875400	example, and when Alice decides or uses some device to select the setting IA, that information
875400	880320	travels backwards in time and then reaches Bob.
880320	885840	This would be a way to deny settings independence.
885840	888760	We are not going to talk about this possibility in here.
888760	894000	We're going to talk about the second possibility of denying settings independence, which has
894000	897040	the name of super determinism.
897040	905720	The idea would be that there is a common cause between all the elements in the experiment
905720	912080	between the state of lambda that we are preparing and whatever is happening in the locations
912080	917080	of Alice's lab and Bob's lab.
917080	922040	Notice that because we have performed with these experiments using information coming
922040	927920	from these processors, the common cause must be really, really back in time.
927920	935240	And it must be a really particular common cause because it is somehow preserving the
935240	941800	correlations between the settings and the state of lambda, even though we have used
941800	946880	a lot of different things to try to randomize how we select AMB.
947000	956280	It would be something like akin to having a system that undergoes physical mixing, but
956280	964560	preserves a particular correlation, even though there is a lot of intricate and ever pressing
964560	974120	different physical processes that we would think would erase any type of correlation.
974120	981880	So these two possibilities seem to most people far-fetched.
981880	988640	In particular, super determinism looks really bad, at least because of three reasons.
988640	995160	It seems that a theory that a super deterministic theory would be too complicated.
995160	996160	Why?
996160	1003600	Because it would somehow be able to correlate these ways in which we randomize the settings
1003600	1008880	of Alice and Bob with the state of lambda, and that seems too cumbersome.
1008880	1016320	Second, it seems that doing this kind of move where we are saying that the correlation will
1016320	1022880	be explained by postulating there is a common past is like abandoning the project of finding
1022880	1027000	an explanation of whatever is happening.
1027000	1033440	Suppose we have a correlation between two variables, it is always possible to say that
1033440	1038320	the correlation was there because the initial conditions of the system were interested in
1038320	1039560	were such and such.
1039560	1043400	It seems that we are not giving an explanation, we are just assuming something about the initial
1043400	1045520	conditions of the system.
1045520	1053120	Lastly, it seems that such a position would jeopardize all experimental science.
1053120	1061280	As I said, an assumption like settings independence is present in all type of experimental procedures
1061280	1063280	we perform.
1063280	1070040	And if we want to deny settings independence, in this case, what makes us stop there?
1070040	1074920	Perhaps we should abandon this assumption and we should abandon the enterprise of doing
1074920	1077840	science in general.
1077840	1079960	So that is settings independence.
1079960	1085560	Those are the reasons why we believe that it is a reasonable assumption.
1085560	1091720	And what are the problems that we might encounter with a super deterministic theory?
1091720	1102800	I will now present our model and let me start by pointing out the trick that we are going
1102800	1103800	to use.
1103800	1112160	We are going to turn standard pilot wave theory if I am not going to give the details of this
1112160	1120920	theory but during the questions perhaps sometimes it will come back again.
1120920	1126880	But we are going to turn this standard pilot wave theory into an equivalent but a fully
1126880	1131560	local model and we are going to do a trick to do so.
1131560	1134120	And it will be useful to have a name for this trick.
1134120	1138760	I am going to call it a linear smooth, I am not going to explain why, but the idea is
1138760	1147600	to put in each physical space, point in space the information regarding all the other points
1147600	1149160	in the universe.
1150160	1155640	It should be clear that by doing that it is possible to transform the dynamics of the
1155640	1159640	model we are constructing in something that is local.
1159640	1168000	The idea would be that each point has the information to do whatever it does without
1168000	1175680	the presence of any other particle.
1175680	1182240	So in standard pilot wave theory we have two equations of dynamical equations, the first
1182240	1188080	one is just the Schrodinger equation and we have also the guiding equation that gives
1188080	1193360	you the dynamics of the hidden variables that theory proposes which are just particles
1193360	1197160	and their positions.
1197160	1202160	We are going to use this linear smooth and what we are going to do is to suppose that
1202160	1207760	at each point in the space there is an internal, there is a set of internal degrees of freedom
1207760	1215760	which are going to be a wave function field and a position field for each point.
1215760	1224840	And doing so it is possible to obtain a dynamic that is fully analogous to the previous two
1224920	1237920	equations but we are now dealing with wave function fields and the position fields.
1237920	1244280	And two comments regarding this move.
1244280	1249480	The first one is the internal degrees of freedom at each point they behave as an n particle
1249480	1250640	pilot wave system.
1250640	1258440	So the idea would be that for each point in physical space we now have an n particle typical
1258440	1261720	pilot wave system.
1261720	1268600	And the second would be that the second observation would be that the theory only contains local
1268600	1277080	bibles in the sense that it is not describing some interaction between whatever is happening
1277080	1283960	between in these points the dynamics is completely described by what is happening at each one
1283960	1288680	of these points and therefore it is completely local.
1288680	1296240	To connect this the model with whatever we find in physical space we specify mass density.
1296240	1302360	This allows us to say that a particular point in physical space is populated by matter only
1302360	1310480	if the particles in the internal degrees of freedom of such a point in physical space
1310480	1314200	have a particle being occupied.
1314200	1319800	So it would be imagined that you have a point in physical space there is the internal degrees
1319800	1325320	of freedom and in those internal degrees of freedom there is a particle that is at the
1325320	1333840	same point that this point or that this physical point is then we find matter there okay.
1333840	1343480	Okay crucial observations for generic conditions we the model is we don't have much okay.
1343480	1351120	We don't have violations of the belt inequalities and we don't even have predictions of the
1351120	1354480	predictions of quantum mechanics okay.
1354480	1364240	But it is easy to see that under very particular initial conditions that is if the wave function
1364240	1371320	field and the position field are the same for each physical point in space then we
1371320	1382320	have three clear consequences the first one is that the points become suddenly coordinated
1382320	1390040	and we have a dynamics that seems like it is describing some universe where things interact
1390040	1397360	causally but in fact we just have points that are being coordinated.
1397360	1404920	Second we are able to recover all the predictions of the standard pilot wave theory and three
1404920	1412240	where we have the violations of belts inequalities two and three are related since in pilot wave
1412240	1418360	theory we have violations of belts inequalities okay.
1418360	1425680	I'm not going to go into the details of this but the question becomes well how can we achieve
1425680	1433240	such an such an homogeneity condition and in the paper we discuss three ways of doing
1433320	1441000	it the first one is by putting it by hand the second is by imposing it imposing it as some type
1441000	1448120	of low-like constraint and the third one is by doing doing so dynamically perhaps during the
1448120	1456760	questions we can talk a little bit about this but okay regarding the the problems that
1457160	1464360	super deterministic theories seem to have what can we say about our model well I think that
1465480	1473000	it is interesting to note that our model shows that it is possible to create a super deterministic
1473000	1480520	model that doesn't have the kind of problems that people feared as it should be obvious that the
1480520	1488280	conditions required to have a workable model are not as complicated as people thought they would be
1489080	1495240	the second point is that well it has as much explanatory power as the standard pilot wave
1495240	1505480	theory has and the third is that the the the model shows that explains why settings independence
1505480	1511880	is violated for belt type experiments but it doesn't say that settings independence should
1511880	1518440	be violated in other types of experiments in science so there is no threat to experimental science
1521160	1526680	there are some problems with the model the the model is is really ugly we are not trying to argue
1526680	1531560	that this is a good way to do physics in the world we are just showing that it is possible to
1531560	1537880	construct this model and that it is a a good place to continue having the discussion regarding
1537880	1545160	whether or not something like super determinism is a reasonable possibility in more detail
1545160	1553320	the the the model seems to require an absolute rest frame and second there seems to be a
1553320	1558280	disconnect in the model between what we can call the the ontology of what is really happening
1558600	1566680	according to the theory and what what what we can have contact with so the theory postulates this
1566680	1574600	internal degrees of freedom for each point in physical space yet we cannot go and see those
1574600	1580120	internal degrees of freedom in fact the theory says that we cannot do that okay we because of
1580120	1588200	the mass density we are explicitly says when can we note something about all of this in
1588200	1595560	internal degrees of freedom and it's under very particular conditions lastly there is an obvious
1595560	1609240	massive enlargement of the ontology in this model and so okay let me finish with a list of contributions
1610040	1617640	that this work has done and in particular that can be seen as consequences of constructing this
1617640	1623560	model so we have presented a model that is completely local and is able to reproduce the
1623560	1630440	predictions of quantum mechanics it does so without being too complicated without losing
1630440	1635560	explanatory power and without making all experimental science obsolete so the problems
1635560	1643080	with this model were not the ones that many people feared at least there are not these three
1643080	1651000	problems and so as a proof of concept it shows that it is possible to construct a super deterministic
1651000	1663240	theory in a way that keeps the physical details of what is happening and finally the model does this
1663240	1672920	all of this by very cumbersome methods and doesn't seem to be to offer any advantage over
1673640	1686760	other alternatives that are non-global that's it okay thanks Carlos thanks for this very nice talk
1687720	1695000	we are almost on time so if someone has a very short question you can post it now otherwise
1695000	1702040	I invite Elias to start sharing cream but if someone has a question for Carlos please go on
1704120	1710360	I had of course questions but I think we are we are quite on time but my question was something
1710360	1717080	like we can of course speak later or by email or something like that but you claim that the world
1717080	1724920	is non-local right but then how can you have in a non-local world device measurements independence
1724920	1728920	for example you will claim that in belly inequalities you don't have measurements
1728920	1733880	independence or something like that because it is non-local and then in your definition of super
1733880	1740520	determinism I don't understand because if you want super determinism or if you want to avoid it
1740520	1747800	because when you post a model like in Leibniz everything is super there is no in Leibniz
1749240	1755000	metaphysics there is no the measurements independence because the monads every monads
1755000	1761240	knows what to do and knows what the rest of the monads are doing so everything is super determined
1761240	1769160	by the the most perfect world chosen by God so it's not clear for me what what you at least
1769800	1775720	the conceptual definitions right what do you want you are completely right in the sense that if you
1776440	1782760	believe in something like the the universe of Leibniz's monads or the kind of universe we are
1782760	1789000	describing with this model yes that's a way to deny settings independence and yes that is a way to
1789000	1797880	to to keep locality but I think that most people would agree that that's a price to high to pay
1801320	1802840	I think I think
