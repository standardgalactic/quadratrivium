0	9440	Okay. Okay, welcome to the second part of the conference of this day. The first talk of this
9440	17200	session is in charge of Michael Jensen from the University of Minnesota. The title of the talk is
17760	24880	quantum kinematics. A new framework for handling probabilities. Go on, Michael.
25600	33360	Okay. Thank you very much for the invitation. Everybody can see my screen. I hope you had
33360	40000	a chance to read my abstract. So what I'll be doing for the most part is to talk about the
40000	47920	correlations you can get with the proverbial Alice and Bob performing measurements on two spin half
47920	53280	particles entangled in the singlet state. And I'll represent the class of correlations that you can
53280	58800	get in that kind of, like I should say, in a setup that was suggested by David Merman,
58800	64160	where Alice and Bob both choose from the same three observables that they're going to measure.
64160	68000	And I'm going to be looking at the kind of correlations that are allowed in that setup,
68000	72880	if you just restrict it to like anything that's non-signaling, anything that can be
72880	77520	done quantum mechanically, and anything that can be done like with local hidden variable theories.
77520	83760	And I'll show you that there is a nice three-dimensional graphical representation of that.
84480	91680	So the work is based on a book that I wrote with Michael Janus and Michael Faro.
92400	100000	So here is the three of us, like in Minneapolis a few years ago. And since the names of the three of
100000	105120	us are sort of variations on Michael, like this has become known in certain circles already as
105120	113120	the three mics manifesto. The book will come out in January. It's in the series Boston Studies in
113120	118480	the Philosophy and History of Science. And its official title is Understanding Quantum Raffles.
119680	127200	Now the book was inspired, and this is the banana that you'll be seeing as my background image
127200	133280	throughout the talk, by this book by Jeff Boop, Banana World, Quantum Mechanics for Primates.
133840	140080	And here you see a picture of me and Jeff at a conference in 2019, like in Santiago,
140800	147360	like following actually right this conference in Cordoba in 2019, where I also gave the talk and
147360	152960	had a great time. So I should also like put in a plug for like the sequel to Banana World,
153680	159600	which is one of my favorite books. It's a serious comic on entanglement by Jeff and his daughter
159600	167760	Tanya, a graphic artist called like Totally, Totally Random. So here's the set up I want to
167760	174320	talk about. And so instead of talking about spin half particles, I'm going to be talking about
174320	181200	like entangled bananas, like I said, in honor of Jeff's book. And so what we have, we start out
181200	187440	with like a pair of entangled bananas, right? So they are described by the usual, you know,
187440	194480	singlet state. And then like Alice and Bob, you know, the side like on one of three ways to
194480	199760	peel the banana. And so this is basically just window dressing for like, you know, they have,
199760	205520	they have like a Dubois magnet with which they measure spin in a certain direction. And now
205520	210240	they're going to hold their banana in a particular direction, you know, while peeling it. And then
210240	216160	they take a bite out of the banana and determine whether the banana tastes yasta, tastes yummy,
216240	223520	or nasty, right? So and the results are we're going to, we're going to put like in a correlation
223520	229280	array, which is really the workhorse of Jeff's book, Banana World. And so here you see like,
229280	234080	you know, Alice can measure A, B and C, Bob can measure A, B and C, they can only find,
234080	240320	you know, plus or minus corresponding to yummy and nasty. And what you see is that if they happen,
240320	246000	all the runs in which they happen to peel the same way, they find like a perfect impact correlation,
246000	254400	and in all the runs in which they peel different ways, they find like an imperfect, like positive
254400	260960	correlation, right? So look at A, B. So there is like, you know, like a three fourth chance of them
260960	267520	finding the same 75% chance of finding the same, and only a 25% chance of them finding opposite.
268160	273360	And the question is like, you know, like, what's how to, how to account for this? Now, so this is
273440	279600	like what you get in this Merman setup, if the angles between like the peeling directions are
279600	286960	like 120 degrees. Now, you can consider like a more general correlation array of this sort.
288000	293440	And we're going to consider like, you know, any array that would like this, that would be
293440	299520	non signaling, right? And in order to guarantee non signaling, if you have these anti correlations,
299600	306480	like on the diagonal, it has to be the case that you get uniform marginals. And you do that by
307680	314960	making sure that in all the off diagonal cells, the sum of both the two rows and the two columns
314960	320640	is equal to a half, right? And so since the probabilities, of course, also have to be like
320640	328560	numbers between zero and one, you get that you can parameterize this by these chi's that I have here,
328560	335280	and these chi's can run for all the way from minus one to plus one, right? And so I can characterize
335280	344400	this correlation array by having three of these parameters for three of these cells, right? This
344400	350400	thing is also going to be symmetric. It doesn't matter if you switch like A and B. So that's the
350400	357200	story here. And you see that in the special case that is considered by Merman, that these chi values
357200	362720	are equal to minus a half, right? So stick that in here. If you put in like minus a half, like this
362720	367360	would be, you know, three halves. So this would be three eighths, right? And this would be, you know,
367360	372640	like, you know, one eighth, right? So you recover that, you recover that Merman's correlation array.
372640	378800	But again, like, you know, you, you, this is a more general form of it. Now, what we're going to try
378880	386720	and do is to see like how, like what subclass of those correlations we can simulate, like with a
386720	393120	raffle, right? And the raffle is our toy model for a local hidden variable theme. And so we have,
393120	397760	we imagine that you have a basket with a bunch of tickets in it, and the tickets like half the
397760	403680	outcomes for like all possible measurements that Alice and Bob can do. Now look at the first ticket,
403680	409280	like, you know, we know that if they, if they measure the same way that they find opposite
409280	414800	results, right? So like, you know, the results on two halves of the tickets have better be up,
414800	419360	has better be opposite. The way it works is that you take a ticket, you rip the ticket in half,
419360	425440	and then you randomly decide like which one goes to Alice and which one goes to Bob, right? So a
425440	429600	ticket where you just switch the left and the right side does not give you a, this does not give
429600	436320	you a new ticket. So with that said, there is like four different tickets, right? So it doesn't
436320	440560	have to be the case that all the pluses are on one side, you could have a case where two of the
440560	445520	pluses are on one side. And like, you know, with one minus, and again, there is three ways of doing
445520	450800	this, right? So you have the minus here is for C here, the minus is for B, and here the minus is
450800	455120	for A, right? And again, keep in mind that it doesn't matter which side of the ticket you're
455120	462720	looking at. Now, we can easily see like if you had like single ticket raffles, just like a basket
462720	469600	with one type, what these sky parameters would be, you know, for your correlation array. Because you
469600	475440	can see that if you have this ticket, no matter whether you take like AA, AB or AC, you always
475440	481440	have like a perfect anti-correlation. And that means that these sky values have to be like plus
481520	488560	one. Like maybe I should go just like back here, right? So the moment that chi is plus one, right,
488560	493600	then you see you have an anti-correlation, the moment that chi is minus one, you have like a
493600	499520	perfect correlation. So okay, so that's easy. Now look at this ticket, there's a little more
499520	506320	complicated. So for AB, you see that there's still a perfect anti-correlation. But if you now look at
506320	513200	AC or at BC, you see that there's a correlation. So you have minus one. And the same is true for
513200	519920	C and D, right? It's just that a different parameter will get like the plus and the other two parameters
519920	527520	will be minus. And here then you immediately have like a bell inequality of the type of the
527520	535120	Klauser-Hornschirmann Holtz variety. And you can see that, you know, like the sum of these three
535120	542000	parameters is three, four ticket A, and it's going to be minus one for all other tickets. So if you
542000	548560	take like an arbitrary mix of tickets, right, you would always get like a value somewhere between
548560	556160	minus one and three. So and you see that Merman's example where chi, where these three chi's are
556160	562320	minus a half. So that would be, if your sum would be minus three halves, violates this inequality.
564000	569200	Now, the nice thing about this is that you can come up with a very nice geometrical representation
569760	577120	of the situation. And that is essentially due to Jeff's long-time collaborator,
578080	585760	now deceased, unfortunately, Idemar Petovsky. And so first of all, we start out with like, you know,
585760	591600	like representing these chi values, they can run from minus one to one in like what is called
591600	596080	like a non-signaling cube. Remember, like, you know, this was like the general form of a correlation
596080	602240	array that is non-signaling. And you see that these tickets, like they're represented now by
602240	609040	vertices of that non-signaling cube, right? So it's these four points, right, A, B, C, and D.
609920	618000	And a mixed raffle would be represented on like points that are like somewhere in between, right?
618000	622640	And once you have, so imagine, like, you know, you have your basket with tickets.
622640	627920	So if you take this and this and you put a certain mix, you can end up somewhere over here,
627920	632160	but then you take a mix of like, you know, D and C, you get somewhere over here,
632160	635600	but you can also like, you know, now mix those, right? So you get all of that,
635600	642240	and you can also like mix and match, mix and get like on the inside of this thing.
642240	649360	So this is like what is known as the classical tetrahedron. And this is like a very nice way of
650480	656160	geometrically representing, you know, what the local hidden variables here we can do.
656720	662880	The bell in the quality only corresponds to like one facet of this tetrahedron.
662880	669600	It just says that you can't be behind that plane like B, C, D, but you see that there are three
669600	675840	other forbidden regions that you would also have to spell out if you want to define fully,
675840	683680	you know, what is and what is not allowed. All right. So now in what is allowed by quantum
683680	690800	mechanics, right? And so in quantum mechanics, the the result that is predicted by quantum
691520	698400	is that these kais are just given by the cosine of the the peeling angle, right? In a way, this is
698400	702720	like very satisfying, right? So classically, you see that these kais with these tickets,
702720	707360	they're always going to be plus one or minus one, but wouldn't it be nice to have like a theory
707360	713120	that just allows like a like a continuity of values between minus one and plus one? Quantum
713120	719120	mechanics gives you just that, right? And so it's the cosine of the of the angle and that cosine,
719120	724560	of course, is the inner product of like unit vectors in these different peeling directions.
726160	733760	All right. So if you think about this correlation array, you see that the entire correlation array
733760	739680	can be like characterized by by these parameters, right? These sky parameters. And we can also
739680	751440	introduce them for the for the for the diagonal cells, where they're just one. Okay. So and so we'll
751440	757200	I'll I'll define this more carefully later on. But these guys are like, you know, what what can be
757200	762560	called like anti correlation coefficients. As for now, it's just hinges on three values, right? If
762560	767680	chi is one, we saw you have a perfect anti correlation. If it's minus one, you have a perfect
767760	772480	correlation, right? So it makes sense that the anti correlation coefficient is then minus one.
772480	779600	If chi is zero, you have no correlation at all. Now look at introduce now like a matrix, an anti
779600	788880	correlation matrix of just these chi values. And you can write that again, like in in terms of these
788880	796400	inner products of these unit vectors. Now, this is a grand matrix, right? And it's a well known
796400	801360	property of the of the grand matrix. It doesn't take too much to verify this. But in the interest
801360	807920	of time, I'll skip that. We know that the determinant of that of that matrix is going to be it's going
807920	813440	to have to be greater or equal than zero. And if you just calculate the determinant of this here,
813440	821200	you now get this condition. Okay. So quantum mechanics like imposes the condition that that,
821280	827760	you know, that this inequality has to be satisfied. So put differently, right? So quantum
827760	833760	mechanics, once you have the idea that these chi values are the cosine of the of the peeling angles,
833760	840480	so you can you can specify like the correlation array by just giving me three angles. But basic
840480	845520	geometry tells me that once I pick two of these three angles, it puts constraints on the third.
845520	852400	And this one, this is the constraint that it that it imposes. And if you now like plot this,
852400	858000	you see that what this picks out is an elliptope, or, you know, what has been called sort of a
858000	863760	fat tetrahedron, you puff it up a bit, the lines here are contained in it. But like, you know,
863760	869360	in the middle, like it's it's blown up a bit. And we call this like the elliptope inequality.
869360	873920	And this then is sort of the quantum analog of the of, you know, what the
875200	880000	the CHSH inequality in the case of the Merman setup, right? And remember, for the full
880000	884880	specification, we don't need just one, but we need four of those inequalities here,
884880	893040	we only need one nonlinear inequality. And this inequality is satisfied by Merman's example,
893040	897040	right? I mean, if you just look at it, you see that this if you put in a half,
897840	902000	you get like exactly that this is going to be equal to zero.
904880	912000	So this is actually a neat result, I think, because it gives a concrete example of like
912000	919680	a cartoon that you often see about how the convex set for, you know, non signaling quantum
919680	925840	and local hidden variable theories are related. Right. So so here is the here's a cross section
925840	932000	of our drawing, right, with the non signaling cube, the elliptope and the tetrahedron, right?
932720	938560	And now compare that to like the cartoon that is in Banana World, right, where you see like
939280	945760	the non signaling cube with like, you know, like the maximal variation, like a Perpeco-Rohlich box,
945760	950560	right, was a super quantum correlation that still is non signaling and doesn't violate special
950560	955760	relativity. Then you have the quantum convex set. And then in the middle, you have the local
955760	961920	polytope. And the beauty is, is that in this particular example of the of the Merman setup,
962800	969200	you you reproduce like now exactly, you know, what you just have as a cartoon in in general.
973600	980160	And you can play the same game for bananas now entangled bananas of higher spin. And so in our
980160	985840	book, we do this right. So here's what the correlation array looks like. Just one cell for a spin one
985840	991440	banana. The anti correlation coefficient, it turns out, you know, which is defined like this.
992160	998000	I'll get to that in a moment, like stays the same is still the cosine. If you go for two,
998000	1005840	three halves still the same cosines. So all these correlations are all like constrained by the exact
1005840	1013680	same elliptope inequality. That's not the case if you now try to simulate them with these raffles.
1014240	1019760	So we saw that, you know, like if you do this for spin half, you get like the tetrahedron, right,
1019760	1025920	so you get something with like four facets like this. If you now go up to higher spin, you see
1025920	1030720	that you get a little more structure on these on these on these facets. So this is what it looks
1030720	1036400	like for spin one and notice that this point here is going to touch the the the elliptope
1038080	1043280	for for spin three halves, it's not going to touch the elliptope again. But for all integer spin,
1043280	1047120	it will, right, you see this gets more and more faceted, more and more
1048960	1055120	vertices. And like you can, it's very suggestive that if you go up to higher and higher spin,
1055120	1060800	it gets more and more close to the elliptope, but never quite gets there, right.
1062320	1070480	Now, the so so far it may seem that this elliptope somehow captures like something special about
1070480	1075280	quantum mechanics, in particular, like we used, you know, sort of as hidden like in what I showed
1075280	1080960	you, what we use like, you know, the Bourne rule, the Hilbert space formalism. But in fact, this
1080960	1087040	inequality is not new to quantum mechanics at all. It has been known to statisticians since the 1890s,
1087040	1092480	and it's basically a general constraint on the correlations between any three random variables,
1092480	1096160	right, which also like, you know, makes it understandable that even if you go to higher
1096160	1100400	spin particles in quantum mechanics, you'll never get out of the get out of the elliptope.
1100960	1106720	So this work is due to Carl Pearson, and mostly to Utney Yule. So Pearson, of course, these days
1106720	1111520	is mostly remembers for his dubious role in the eugenics movement, but he's also like, you know,
1111520	1117280	like a very important character in statistics. So let me run to this quickly, right. So now we're
1117280	1122320	talking about some arbitrary random variables with sets of possible outcomes that I'm going to
1122320	1127520	keep discreet. And in fact, I'm only interested in a case where you have you have a random variable
1127520	1135440	with only two outcomes, like, you know, yummy and nasty. And so I'm going to restrict my attention to
1136000	1142560	what we call balanced random variables. And that just means that if X i X of i is a possible value,
1142560	1149520	minus X i is two, and that the probability of X i and the probability of minus X i is the same.
1150400	1156240	And that simplifies matters, because that means that in that case, the expectation value is going
1156240	1162880	to be zero. And that simplifies like some other variables that some other quantities that we're
1162880	1168000	interested in. So we're looking at the variance, right? So the expectation value of X minus the
1168000	1174000	expected value of X squared. If the expected value of X is zero, then the variation of X is just the
1174000	1180080	expectation value of X squared. The standard deviation is the square root of that. And then
1180080	1185520	the covariance, again, like, you know, in general would be like the expectation value of X minus
1185520	1190880	the expectation value of X times Y minus the expectation value of Y, if these two expectation
1190880	1198080	values are zero, then that is just going to be equal to the expectation value of X times Y.
1199680	1204560	And I now introduce like what is called the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is just the
1204560	1213200	covariance of the Pearson correlation coefficients of X and Y is the covariance of X and Y divided
1213200	1220080	by the corresponding standard deviation, sigma X and sigma Y. And so if X and Y are balanced,
1220160	1226880	this is just the expectation value of X and Y divided by these standard deviations.
1226880	1233520	And you can immediately see two properties like, you know, the Pearson correlation coefficient
1233520	1239040	of a variable with itself is just one. And it doesn't matter if you look at a correlation coefficient
1239040	1250320	X, Y or Y, X. And we'll now I'll now prove for you that such such any triplet of such variables
1250320	1254960	is going to have to satisfy this elliptope inequality. And this was shown by Yule in the
1254960	1260240	late 1890s. So here's where here's one way to do it, like, you know, consider, you know, for any
1260240	1267840	triplet v1 v2 v3, like this quantity over here. So I'm looking at the expectation value of some
1267840	1272640	expression squared. So I know this is going to be greater or equal to zero. And now I'm going to
1272640	1278960	work this out. Okay, so I take like, you know, like this term times the rest that gives me this
1278960	1286080	here, right. And so notes that I now get like, you know, v1. And then I have like, x times x,
1286080	1292240	right, expectation value x squared divided by sigma x squared. And then we have the x times the y,
1292240	1299760	the x times z. And then you have similar terms for like, if you now do the v2 y over sigma y and v3
1299760	1305840	z over sigma c. And you see that in here, like you have like all these Pearson correlation
1305840	1311120	coefficients, it just looks like that. Right. And I can write this like a little more
1311680	1318640	concisely and compactly as justice matrix with these Pearson correlation coefficients
1318720	1327520	sandwiched between like, you know, the column vector v1 v2 v3, and the row vector v1 v2 v3.
1328400	1335840	And remember that this thing has to be greater or equal than zero for any, for any value of v1,
1335840	1341760	v2, v3, which means that that matrix row is positive semi definite, which means that the
1341760	1348080	determinant of row has to be greater or equal than zero. And it follows that, you know, that
1348080	1355360	that's just the elliptope inequality. Right. So there we have it again. Okay. So now,
1357280	1364000	look at the special case that x, y, and z are the taste of Alice's banana, right, in this
1364000	1370640	experiment in the, in the Merman setup, right. So x is the, the taste of Alice's banana when she
1370640	1375920	peels in the A direction, y is the taste of Alice's banana when she peels in the B direction and z
1375920	1382320	is the taste when Alice's banana when she peels in the C direction. All right. So now the obvious
1382320	1389040	problem is, is that as Papescu points out in the, in the preface or the forward of banana world,
1389760	1394800	a banana can only be eaten once, right, once it's peeled, it's peeled, once it's tasted, it's
1394800	1402080	tasted. But there's, we'll see there's ways around this, this, this problem. So first I note that
1402080	1406880	these variables are balanced, right. So we have to now give them some numerical value rather than
1406880	1412640	just yummy or nasty, but you know, inspired by spin, you know, like instead of having like a half
1412640	1419360	h bar, we now have like a half, like a B bar, you know, which I call the banana split, which is just
1419360	1426080	boops constant B divided by two pi. And we're going to pick units such that B bar is equal to one.
1427040	1432240	And so then, you know, these, we see that these, that these variables are perfectly balanced,
1432240	1439520	the expectation value is zero, the variance, right. So it's like, you know, half, half the time,
1439520	1446240	like, you know, it's the product is, it's, it's, it's one half squared, the other half is like,
1446240	1451040	you know, minus a half squared, and that adds up to one fourth, the standard deviation take the
1451040	1457200	square root that is like a half. Now the covariance here, it's a little trickier.
1458320	1463680	And what we're going to do. And like, you know, if you, if you're squeamish about this, like, we
1463680	1470640	did find a way to avoid like this counterfactual reasoning. But I think it's perfectly innocuous.
1470640	1477520	We're going to use my the opposite, if you want to find the covariance of the variables Alice,
1478400	1483360	Alice's taste of banana when peeling a and the taste of Alice's banana when peeling B.
1484320	1494720	So half Alice appeal a and then have her use minus what Bob finds when he peels B as a proxy
1494720	1498640	for what she would have find had she peeled B instead.
1501120	1505920	And so basically, like, you know, that so we use we calculate this thing here,
1505920	1513840	and we can use our correlation array to figure this out. Right. So we have like, if the if the
1513840	1523280	if the tastes are are the are the same, we get we get we get like one fourth. What is the probability
1523280	1527920	of that happening? Well, you need to add these two things. Right. So that's a half one minus
1528560	1533120	guy AB. And then, you know, like, if they're opposite, it's minus one fourth. And the probability
1533120	1537920	of that happening is this, if you work this out, you see that this is one fourth times guy AB.
1538640	1542400	And if you now like calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, you see that that is
1542400	1548960	exactly equal to guy AB. Right. I already took an advance on that result calling this guy be like
1548960	1552240	an anti correlation coefficient, right. And the anti is because of this minus.
1554480	1560240	All right. So the elliptop inequality, you know, I can just now write for this for these particular
1560240	1563920	variables, right. So in terms of these rows, now, in terms of these guys.
1565760	1571280	And so this is just exactly the same. But there is a few problems, right. So the first problem
1571280	1578800	we already dealt with, like, how do we determine the taste of these two of a Alice feeling a and
1578800	1585600	Alice feeling B and one run? Well, you know, have or use Bob's result as a proxy for one of those.
1585600	1591200	Right. Now, the second problem is like, you know, we can only do this for two tastes for two
1591200	1596640	feelings in one run. Well, that's not a big problem either. Like, you can just have different ones.
1596640	1600800	Right. So if you think about it, that's what we always do, you know, like you like, if you think
1600800	1606640	about the early tests of the CHSH inequality, they weren't switching the settings like, you know,
1606640	1612320	from run to run, you just take measurements for one pair of standing and then fill in another
1612320	1617520	pair. That's all perfectly fine. So that we can do the third problem seems to be a lot nastier.
1618080	1624640	And there the promise is that, you know, that we we derive this elliptop inequality from the
1624640	1631440	condition starting that this the expectation value, this quantity is always greater equal than zero.
1631440	1639040	Right. But the point is that we cannot determine the value of this in one in one run. And it would
1639040	1644960	seem that if if all these three variables like can only take on values like plus or minus a half,
1644960	1649680	that yes, it's going to be greater equal than zero. But that inequality is not tight because like,
1649680	1654080	you know, like we could easily the smallest we could get this is to something like, you know,
1654080	1660000	a half, like, you know, like a state plus and minus, minus here, and then we have a quarter.
1660960	1668880	So this took us a while to to to figure out and the the the answer actually hinges on like,
1669760	1673600	you know, like an interesting property of quantum mechanics, namely that in quantum mechanics,
1673600	1678640	it's perfectly possible for a sum to have a definite value, even if the individual terms
1678640	1684160	in that sum do not. Right. So the simplest example I can think of is like, you know, the Hamiltonian
1684240	1689760	for harmonic oscillator, clearly P and Q cannot have like, you know, definite values at the same
1689760	1695120	time, but you know, the Hamiltonian can. And so to look at this a little more clearly, right,
1695120	1700320	so if you if you were looking essentially at sort of a sum of like her mission operators,
1701120	1707600	linear combination, and that in and of itself should be like a good operator. And so if you
1707600	1712880	introduce like, you know, now like in analogy with a spin vector, like a taste vector,
1714160	1721040	you get, you can write like the taste in the A direction as like the inner products of like
1721040	1729120	T with like the unit vector in the A direction, same for TB, same for TC. And then the inequality
1729120	1735280	becomes this, and you see that we're in a product thing, but the the taste vector with this vector,
1735280	1743360	and this will be zero whenever this combination is zero. Right. And so if you if there are if you
1743360	1748000	pick the right peeling directions for starters that need to be in one plane, you can actually
1748000	1754000	like achieve that. So this this inequality is tight. And this result applies to so the general
1754000	1762720	result of yield does applies to to this to this quantum example. All right. So what do I want
1762720	1768880	to conclude from this? Okay. So the point is, is that this elliptope inequality that we derived
1768880	1774080	first within quantum mechanics from the geometry of Hilbert space can also be derived without
1774080	1779040	quantum mechanics as a general constraint on correlations between three random variables.
1779680	1786560	And is this this distinction like actually we got from within from without from a song by Bob Dylan.
1793120	1814960	So the message then this is the big message of the of the talk is that what this suggests
1814960	1819920	is that the basic Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics is just a new framework for
1819920	1825600	handling probabilities. Right. And so this take on quantum mechanics, which has been dubbed
1825600	1832080	boobism is a pun on cubism by Robert Mischewitz belongs, I think, to a class of informational
1832080	1840960	makeovers of the much maligned Copenhagen interpretation. And so in order to to make that
1840960	1846160	clear, like I want to talk, I'll take five more minutes to make the point. And this is far more
1846240	1851280	speculative and tentative than what I've said so far. I think it's best to sort of think in terms
1851280	1856080	of like a genealogy of quantum interpretations. And so we got like two versions of quantum
1856080	1862480	mechanics around 1925 26. First, we have matrix mechanics. And Heisenberg's big discovery was
1862480	1869040	that these problems in spectroscopy that he was running into, just call for a new framework for
1869120	1876400	dealing with with physics, just as like the problems that people had run into in electrodynamics
1876400	1880800	around the turn of the century, called for a new framework of dealing with spatial temporal
1881360	1886240	relations. Now, of course, a little bit later, like Schrodinger comes up with wave mechanics,
1886240	1890880	and his big discovery compatible with Heisenberg was very different, like namely,
1890880	1895920	here the idea is that something wavy is underlying the behavior that we're seeing. And the analogy
1895920	1902160	here is with wave optics in the 19th century. And so they famously didn't care for each other,
1902880	1906720	for each other's views, like, you know, like Heisenberg calling wave mechanics disgusting,
1907680	1912320	and Schrodinger calling matrix mechanics repulsive. And but of course, like mathematical
1912320	1916080	equivalence was rapidly proved in part by Schrodinger himself, but then by the rock,
1916080	1921360	yard down for Neumann. And that kind of papers over like a very different way of thinking about
1921360	1926720	the state, the status of the state vector in the Hilbert space. And I think roughly you can say
1926720	1930640	that the descendants of wave mechanics, those are the ontic interpretations of quantum mechanics,
1930640	1937360	think Everett, the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory, and the Girardi-Romini-Weber spontaneous
1937360	1942240	collapse theory. And the descendants of matrix mechanics are the epistemic interpretations
1942240	1950720	in where I would include Copenhagen, Cubism, and now like, you know, Bubism. And so just a quick way
1950800	1955920	of sort of showing, you know, what I'm, what I'm after, like contrast Boop with Everett, right?
1955920	1960240	So for Boop, like what the Hilbert space is doing you is doing for you, it's giving you the Born
1960240	1965920	Rule, but it doesn't represent stuff, right? In order to represent stuff, you need like some specific
1965920	1972720	quantum applications running on this new quantum operating system to use kind of the metaphor
1972720	1977840	of Nielsen and Chang's book on quantum information. Now, for Everett, it's just the way,
1977920	1980960	it's just the other way around. Hilbert space gives you stuff, you know,
1980960	1984400	Sean Carroll, like says, like, you know, the world is made out of wave functions, right?
1985920	1991040	So, but it doesn't give you the Born Rule now, right? I mean, so for that they appeal to decision
1991040	1996480	theory for agents and a multiverse, okay? Now, so this is Oxford Everettians, there's also another
1996480	2001840	class of Everettians, Berlin Everettians like Christoph Lainer, who really have the courage
2001840	2007760	of their convictions, who use like Hilbert space both to represent stuff and to get the Born Rule
2007840	2011520	and of course, it's a good Everettian, right? You take advantage of the fact that in a multiverse,
2011520	2018720	you really can have your cake and eat it too. So now, for more careful exegesis of all of this,
2019600	2024160	you, you know, I'm going to refer you to our book, where especially like, you know,
2024160	2031520	microfarro, like, lace this out, like much more patiently than I just did, and I'm going to leave
2031520	2037280	you like with one more version of this, of this Dylan song.
2062160	2070240	Now, right, I'm happy to take some questions if there's time.
2071600	2079120	Yes, we have some minutes for comments or questions. If you want to make a comment or question, please
2079120	2096560	indicate it in the chat. I have a short question. Do you think that, or my real question is,
2096560	2102400	if you have some experience in the classroom with this type of
2103280	2112320	topological approximation mechanics, do you think that it can help in education?
2116400	2120160	I'm just making sure. Do you think the question is, like, do you think that this
2120160	2122400	way of thinking about quantum mechanics can help education?
2122640	2136320	No, this form to present some results with the topological forms can help in education
2136320	2140000	of quantum mechanics in the in the courses in the universe.
2141120	2145040	Yeah, no, I mean, like, I'm currently teaching a course on introducing, like,
2145040	2148000	non physics majors to quantum mechanics, where I very much use this,
2148720	2152640	use this approach that I showed you, right? And so, and like,
2153680	2158560	yeah, and so, but it's, I mean, it gives you like a particular way of thinking about quantum
2158560	2164160	mechanics, right? It really pushes this idea that quantum mechanics is like a, you know,
2164160	2169440	the kinematics of quantum mechanics, right? The basic formalism is a new framework for handling
2169440	2173600	probabilities, right? And that, you know, in order to do anything else, right, now you need to do
2173600	2180160	dynamics, you need to like introduce like stuff, right? And what quantum mechanics is telling you
2180160	2186560	that it had to, that it has to behave according to the rules of quantum, right? So, so that's,
2186560	2192480	that's the view I'm pushing. Historically, what I find interesting is that if you now look at
2192480	2199760	modern books on probability theory and statistics, is that Hilbert space methods are being used in
2199760	2205600	these books. And somehow like, so as a historian, I'm very interested, like how it came to be,
2205600	2210000	that there seems to be very little communication between people in physics using Hilbert space
2210000	2217120	methods, and people in general statistics using like Hilbert space methods. Okay, thank you. And
2217120	2227520	there is a question from Federico Hoelig. Yes, thanks, Michelle, for, for this wonderful talk.
2227600	2233920	It's always great to hear you. I always get really excited. And I want to learn more about
2233920	2242640	this approach. And my question is related to what is the stake or the take of your interpretation
2242640	2251040	with regard to non-locality? Because if you interpret quantum mechanics as a new probability
2251040	2258000	formalism, what can you say about the strong claims that the word is local versus the word
2258000	2265760	is non-local? What will you say about that? Yeah, so, so the, that's a difficult question.
2266960	2273680	So, so what I would say is that, you know, in the spirit of what I showed you is that,
2273680	2282000	you know, like you would, you would have thought that special relativity like requires you to,
2282000	2287440	you know, like tell some story where you can like screen off like any correlation by something,
2287440	2292560	you know, that by a common cause. And it turns out that the constraints are not that tight,
2292560	2298000	you can have like, you can have like a very much more liberal constraint and still be
2298000	2303280	non-singling. In fact, you can go beyond quantum mechanics, and you can have like PR boxes. And
2303280	2308000	so to, I would say you just have to get used to the fact that you should resist the temptation
2308000	2314480	that when you have these like correlations that cannot be dealt with sort of the standard way
2314480	2318720	screening them off by conditionalizing on common causes, that you think of these as just
2318720	2323840	constrained produced by natures and not like, oh, Alice does one thing and then like, you know,
2323840	2330160	like it travels like instantaneously to Bob or vice versa. And if you, if you, if you go for this
2330800	2335520	if you go this epistemic route, that is easier, right? I mean, like, I think a lot of students
2335520	2342000	in quantum mechanics who, you know, like, no matter how, how often you tell them that astrodinger,
2342000	2347520	that astrodinger wave function is not a field on ordinary space, still have this picture like,
2347520	2352800	well, then you do a measurement and the whole thing goes poof, instantaneously. And like now
2352800	2357440	you're stretching your head like, you know, what is it that is traveling from like Alice to Bob
2357440	2363280	that then like frustratingly you can never use to send a signal, right? And so I'm hoping that
2363280	2368240	this approach will sort of prevent people like, you know, from going down that particular rabbit
2368240	2382640	hole in the first place. Okay, thanks. Thanks. It's clear. Yeah. I tend to agree. Yes.
