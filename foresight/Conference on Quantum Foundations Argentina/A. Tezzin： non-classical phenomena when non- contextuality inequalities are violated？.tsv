0	8320	Thanks, and now we move on to the next speaker of this morning's session with Alison Desin.
8320	12080	Please, Alison, if you can start sharing your screen.
18320	19280	Can you hear me?
20000	25040	Yes, perfectly. And also, perhaps it's better if you put a full screen mode.
25680	26000	Okay.
26240	36560	Okay. Okay, so the next speaker is Alison Desin from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil,
37360	44960	and he's talking about are we witnessing non-local phenomena when non-contextuality inequalities
44960	53360	are violated? Please, Alison, go on. Okay, so I'd like to thank the organizers for having
53360	61040	attended my talk, and congratulations for this very nice conference, and it's a pleasure to be here.
61760	69120	And so, as you see, this talk is about a question, and the question is if we are witnessing
69120	74800	non-classical phenomena when non-contextuality inequalities are violated? And I would like
74800	81120	to begin this presentation by just finding this question. And in order to do that, I will show
81760	87360	a couple of examples of very recent papers where this claim is made. So the claim that
87360	94160	contextuality, which means by which I mean the violation of a non-contextuality inequality,
94160	102880	is some kind of signature of non-classicality. So these are the examples. So contextuality is a
102880	109600	non-classical behavior that can be exhibited by quantum systems. It's a non-classical feature
109600	115840	challenging everyday intuition. It's a non-classical property exhibited by quantum statistics.
117040	122640	It's a key signature of non-classicality. And finally, it's their catapult on classical
122640	130560	feature of quantum phenomenology. So we know that this is a common view. And in order to contrast
130560	136640	contextuality and classicality, let me explain what I mean by classicality. And I will do that
136640	146720	basically by quoting this paper. And the main point is that as I see it, a criterion for classicality
146720	154160	must have a phenomenological meaning. So as they say in this paper, a criterion of classicality
154880	161920	must allow us to say that in some sense, nature fails to respect classical physics.
162880	169280	So non-classical phenomena must defy classical understanding. And this is basically what I
169280	176800	expect from a criterion of classicality. So we can now rephrase our initial question,
176800	184400	just to be more explicitly. And we are asking if nature fails to respect classical physics when
184400	192080	non-contextuality and equivalence are violated. Okay, so now let's discuss non-contextuality and
192080	199120	equivalence. And this definition of contextuality that is the violation of non-contextuality and
199120	205280	equivalence, it's a very operational definition in the sense that it's a definition we apply for
205280	220880	experimental data. So contextuality. Wait, wait, there's something I will try to move Federico.
221840	226480	Everyone please move their phones. Sorry, Allison, please go on. Okay.
226480	236880	Okay, so as I said, this is an operational definition, the sense that it's a label we
236880	244400	apply for experimental data. And this idea of contextuality as something that we can apply
244400	252800	for data with no reference to the underlying structure of the mechanism we are working with,
253440	259120	it's a definition that arises in the context of this model independent approach to physics.
259920	267040	So I will discuss this model independent approach very briefly because I think some
267040	274800	of you may not be familiar with it. And the core idea behind model independent approach to physics
274800	282480	is this idea of a black box. And a black box is a measurement setup. And we say we call it a
282480	289280	black box because we assume that we can ignore the underlying structure of this setup and we can
289280	295440	look onto the data. So as Popesco says, according to this view, the entire physics should be
295440	302400	encapsulated in the data. And we can discuss, for example, locality from this perspective. So
303680	308880	we can discuss locality beyond quantum mechanics. So with no reference to quantum systems. So all
308880	316480	we need are devices and measurements that are outputs. And we can also discuss contextuality
316480	322080	in this perspective. And this is exactly the definition of contextuality that is based on
322080	328640	non-contextuality in equities. So contextuality is the violation of non-contextuality in equities,
328640	335840	just as non-locality is the violation of the inequalities. Or we can equivalently say that
335840	343760	contextuality corresponds to the existence of global sections. So this is equivalent to say
343760	355200	that contextuality is the violation of non-contextuality in equities. And just to make it clear that
355200	360400	this idea of black box appears in contextuality analysis, I will show two examples. So here they
360400	365840	say that we have a black box and that the agent consumes the box by simultaneously performing
365840	372880	a subset of measurements. And a subset of measurements that we can simultaneously perform is what we
372880	381360	call a context. And here they say the same. So we have a black box that is a device containing
381360	387280	buttons and lights. And buttons represent measurements and lights represent outcomes
387280	392800	or outputs. And we have contexts that are collections of buttons that we can press jointly.
393760	399520	And okay, so these are some pictures representing this idea of black box in contextuality analysis.
399520	404720	So here we see that we have a black box with inputs that are buttons or measurements and
404720	413360	outputs that are represented as lights. So okay, so this is basically this this model
413440	422000	independent view. And now we will show a particular example of black box. And we will discuss this
422000	429440	example using the compatibility hypergraph approach to contextuality. That is one of many
429440	435520	model independent approach to contextuality analysis. And we have to introduce a measurement
435520	441680	scenario in order to define a black box. And the measurement scenario we consider is a very
441680	445120	standard example of a measurement scenario in contextuality analysis.
446880	453200	That is the device cycle. So in this scenario, we have only five measurements. And all measurements
453200	459200	of this scenario are binary. So they have only two possible outcomes. So one and zero. And this is
459200	466880	the symbol we call one. And this is the symbol we call zero. Okay, and we also have to define
466960	473760	a context. So we call that a context represents a collection of measurements that can be measured
473760	480080	simultaneously. And these are the contexts we consider in the five cycle. So a context in
480080	486880	this scenario is a pair of consecutive measurements. So for example, a one, a two is a context,
486880	493520	a three, a four is a context, a four, a zero is not a context, and so on. So we have five contexts.
493520	501040	And as I said, this is a very standard example of measurement scenario for contextuality analysis.
501040	507680	So these measurements are like the buttons of our black box. And now we have to introduce
507680	515120	a behavior for this scenario. That is the data our black box generates. And the behavior we consider
515120	522960	is a very famous example of contextual behavior in the five cycle. And the behavior and it's
522960	530160	this behavior. So by definition in contextual analysis, the behavior of a scenario is context
530160	534960	dependent. So we associate a probability distribution for each context. And this is the
534960	542080	distribution we associate for a context in the five cycle. So, so if we measure together AI and AI
542080	549840	plus one, we will never obtain the same outcome. And the probability of obtaining zero one or one
549840	555200	zero is the same. And this is this is the data our black box generates. So this is the behavior of
555200	562880	our box of our box. And okay, and what we can say about this behavior. So first of all, it's not
562880	570160	disturbing, which means that according to this behavior, it means that a measurement has the
570160	576560	same distribution across all contexts. And moreover, according to this behavior, a measurement
576560	582480	behaves like a coin toss. And this is one of the reasons why we are calling this behavior a
582480	590560	generalized coin toss. This behavior is an example of stronger than quantum correlation,
590560	595920	which means that quantum theory cannot predict this behavior. And finally, this behavior is
595920	602000	contextual. So it violates a non contextuality inequality or equivalently, we cannot define
602000	607600	a global section for this behavior. So it means that we cannot define a probability distribution,
607600	613760	including all measurements of this scenario that is capable of predicting this behavior. So, and
617040	623040	this is an example of a maximum contextual behavior in the five cycle. And this is why this
623120	630720	example is very famous. Okay. And in the in the compatibility
630720	636800	hydrograph approach, contextuality and nonclassicality are equivalence definitions. So according to
636800	642880	this approach, if our black box generates this this data, then then we have to say that our
642880	651600	black box generates non classical correlations. Okay. So thus far, we have discussed contextuality
651600	659440	from this model independent view. And we have showed a very famous example of contextual behavior
659440	664720	in the five cycle. So this is the data our box generate. And this is the data we are going to
664720	674480	analyze. Okay, but now I will let's let's look inside the the box. And your and to begin with,
674480	679920	I would like to compare on the balance with contextuality and equities because
680000	687280	as I said, contextuality, according to this definition is the violation of non contextuality
687280	693360	and equities, just as no locality is the violation of very equities from this model
693360	697760	independent perspective. So let's compare these two definitions. So suppose we have
699680	704960	a bell scenario. So it's a scenario containing two space like separated parts. So each part has
704960	710000	a black box, and each part is performing measurements, and they are generating data
710000	714320	together. And we analyze this data. And if it is data violate a bell inequality,
714960	719600	we can say that we are witnessing a non local phenomenon, which means that
721600	726960	and locality or non locality is a physical concept in the sense that we can define it
726960	732560	in terms of physical principles. For example, we can define locality using using special
732560	741120	relativity. And in this case, so in this case, the data we have is is intrinsically associated
741120	746320	with a physical phenomenon. And we can really ignore the underlying structure of these boxes.
746880	752400	So this this measurements, they can be, for example, questions, yes, no questions we ask for
752400	759280	these agents. And these outputs can be answers they give. And if it in this case, if this
760160	764560	if these bell inequalities are violated, we can say that we are we are witnessing
765280	769680	no local phenomenon. So there is this physical phenomenon associated to the data we have.
770960	778160	But in contextual analysis, we have no physical phenomenon associated to it, because
778880	784720	contextuality according to this model independence definition is not a physical phenomenon,
784800	790560	because we cannot define it in terms of physical principles. So it would not be a surprise if
791280	796240	inside a box generating non classical correlations are contextual correlations,
796240	804880	we had a a a simple classical structure. And, and I will try to show now that
804880	809200	this is the case for the behavior we we we called a generalized coin toss.
809200	818960	Okay, and before we go through the example, I would like to say three things about it.
818960	825280	So first of all, recall that we are assuming here that everything is encapsulated in the data.
825280	830880	So we can, in some sense, ignore the ignore the underlying structure of this black box.
830880	836720	So a black box is a very permissive concept. So it may contain an entire laboratory containing
836720	846880	particles and measuring devices. And also the the the mechanism we propose is basically a
846880	855040	toy mechanism for coin tossing. And coin tossing is is according to many operational
855040	859360	approach to physics, it's a valid example of measurement procedure. So for example,
860800	863360	people who work with packing context reality and
863440	869920	generalize the probability theories, they are all the time using coin tossing as an example of
869920	876960	measuring procedure that is valid. So that's why we say that this mechanism works along the line
876960	883360	set out in many operational approach. So according to these approach, if we had inside a black box
883360	891920	a coin coin flip a coin tossing, it would be a valid measurement procedure. And more importantly,
892880	899440	this this mechanism is something like a thought experiment. So we are trying to show that unlike
899440	904240	no local data, no contextual data can be generated by a simple classical mechanism.
904240	909680	So this mechanism should be understood as a thought experiment. So it's not a mechanism
909680	917200	that is interesting by itself. So okay, now let's go through the the mechanism. And as I said,
917200	921600	it's it's basically a toy mechanism for coin tossing. And how can we describe
924080	932240	a coin toss using toy mechanism. So we need an object. So in the in the real world, we we use
932240	939120	a coin that is an object has that for all practical purposes has two sides. So here in this time
939120	945760	mechanism, we consider for the sake of simplicity, a 2D object, and each has two sides. So one side
945760	955520	is dark gray, the other side is light gray. And we have we need to flip this object. So we fix an
955520	961200	axis passing through the center of this object, and we flip this object. And at the end of the
961200	967920	movement, we look to the side that is showing when the coin lands. So this is the real case.
967920	974960	So in this toy mechanism, we we we fix this side of the object. So and we imagine that this is a
974960	982320	sensor and the sensor can detect color that in this case is gray. And it can distinguish dark
982320	989360	from light color. So we have these two outputs. So these outputs are like hazard tails. So they
989360	996160	they are dark gray or light gray. And the behavior we obtain if we perform these measurements,
996160	1001360	these measurements. So if we flip this coin is the behavior of a fair conflict, because this
1001360	1008400	mechanism is is constructed for for this purpose. So okay, so this is a toy mechanism for coin toss.
1010080	1017120	And the point is that we can propose a straightforward generalization of this mechanism
1017840	1023600	that is capable of generating the the behavior we call a generalized coin toss that, as I said,
1023600	1029280	is a very famous example of contextual correlation, contextuality analysis.
1030960	1039600	So a coin toss, we have one binary measurement. So we need an object having one pair of positive
1039600	1046640	sides. But in the generalized coin toss, we have five pairs of positives. So we have five binary
1046640	1052720	measurements. So we need an object having five pairs of positive sides. So it could be something
1052720	1062560	like an unsided dice or something like this. And but we are proposing just a toy mechanism. So we
1062560	1068800	consider a 2D object. And this is a regular decadent. And for each pair of positive sides,
1068800	1075920	we associate a measurement. And for for its measurement, we associate a color. And okay,
1075920	1084800	and the measurement procedure inside of this box is a coin flipping. But the the the flipping is
1084800	1092240	determined in this case by the context. So the context in this toy mechanism is an axis passing
1092240	1098480	through the center of the object. And together with a sensor and the sensor can detect color and
1098480	1104400	it can distinguish that from each color. So for example, if we want to measure a two and a three
1104400	1111840	together, if we press these buttons in our box, this mechanism will just flip this coin. But with
1111840	1117520	respect to the axis that they're mined by this context, so this is the axis, this vertical line.
1118240	1123760	And if we do that, we can obtain two possible outcomes. So we can detect dark yellow and
1123760	1129600	light green, or we can detect light yellow and dark green. So we can never detect, for example,
1129600	1133920	dark yellow and dark green because they are in a positive side of this object. So
1133920	1140080	this is a mere geometrical restriction of the object. And this is why we have this,
1140080	1144800	we have the correlation that is predicted by the generalized coin toss in this context.
1146160	1152160	And this is the mechanism we have. So each context is an axis together with a sensor. And
1152160	1160480	whatever is the context we consider, we have only these two possible outcomes and the behavior is
1160480	1168240	the behavior we call a generalized coin toss. Okay. And we also must be able to measure single,
1168240	1172400	to perform single measurements. And in order to do that, we have to fix a context.
1173600	1178320	So this is the general case in contextual analysis. So for example, if we want to measure
1178960	1185360	these measurements, A0, that is red, we have two options. So we have two contexts containing A0,
1185360	1189760	and we have to choose one of them. So we can choose, for example, this context,
1189760	1196320	and we just flip this object. And so we have two possible outcomes, so dark red or light red,
1196320	1204080	and the behavior is the behavior of a fair coin slip. So to sum up, this mechanism, this time
1204160	1210560	mechanism, or just thought experiment, generates the behavior we call a generalized coin toss.
1212240	1219440	And okay, and what we can say based on this example, based on this thought experiment.
1219440	1223200	So first of all, let's discuss contextuality beyond content theory.
1225840	1230880	Okay, so the first point is that without clear specification of what measurement means,
1230880	1235840	contextuality has no phenomenological significance. It means that the meaning of
1235840	1240480	contextuality or the phenomenological meaning depends on what we mean by a measurement.
1241280	1248080	So in contextual analysis, the underlying structure matters. So we cannot say that,
1248880	1255360	I think that based on this thought experiment, I think this thought experiment suggests that we
1255360	1262240	cannot ignore the underlying structure in order, when we are analyzing data from this
1262240	1270320	perspective of contextuality. Which means that in contextuality analysis, the entire physics
1270320	1278800	does not seem to be encapsulated in the data. So what we mean by measurement is important.
1279520	1286480	And finally, contextuality, at least beyond content theory, does not require a non-classical
1286480	1294320	phenomenon. Okay, and can we say something about contextuality in content theory,
1295120	1301840	based on this thought experiment? And I think we can. So note that in our thought experiment,
1302480	1310160	we are working with a classical object. So it's basically a coin. So
1312880	1318400	it's a classical object in the sense that it's a rigid body. So it's just a thought mechanism.
1318400	1327440	So we say it's a 2D object, but we can imagine it as a real body, just as we imagine a coin as
1327600	1334240	a rigid body. And okay, so we have this classical object and measurements, our measurement procedures
1334240	1340160	are not revealing perverts processed by the system. And also we have context. So not all
1340160	1345760	measurements can be simultaneously performed. So we have this restriction that is an
1345760	1351760	instrumental restriction. So this is part of our mechanism. So it means that in our
1352480	1357920	experiment, we are working with measurements that I like to co-example, that are measurements
1358960	1361760	that are not revealing perverts processed by a system.
1363760	1372640	And we know that this view on measurement is a very common view on content measurements,
1372640	1376640	because we have Cauchy's Becker theorem. And Cauchy's Becker theorem says that
1377280	1381840	self-adjoint operators cannot be thought of as representing perverts simultaneously
1381840	1389360	processed by a system. So Cauchy's Becker theorem suggests some kind of substantive
1389360	1394160	view on measurements. So we have to accept that measurements are not revealing perverts
1394160	1400000	processed by a system, or at least that they are not revealing perverts that are
1400960	1406880	simultaneously processed by the system. But the point is that if the measurements we have
1406880	1412160	are epistemic, so if the measurements we have are not revealing perverts of a system,
1412160	1419360	then we have contextuality in the data. So the data our system generates will violate
1419360	1423600	non-contextuality and equivalence. And it's not because the system is non-classical or it's classical,
1423600	1429280	it's because measurements are epistemic. And the reasons that epistemic measurements cannot be
1429280	1434960	defined as random variables share in the same sample space. So we cannot define the
1434960	1441840	measurements because the measurements that are like coin flippings in our thought experiment,
1441840	1447040	we cannot represent those measurements as random variables in the same sample space.
1448080	1457680	And that's why we have contextuality in content systems, I think. And we must recall that
1457680	1465120	KS theorem, Cauchy-Specker theorem is about realism, it's not about classicality. So to sum up,
1466320	1473440	in quantum mechanics, we have, so in general, actually, if we have epistemic measurements,
1473440	1477360	or if we have measurements that are not revealing perverts processed by a system,
1477360	1482800	and if we have context, so if we have these restrictions on what we can measure jointly,
1483440	1489200	then we have contextual data. So we have no ground for expecting non-contextuality in the data,
1489200	1495200	because our measurements are not random variables in the same sample space. So
1496160	1502320	I think that this thought experiment suggests that those who accept the epistemic view on
1502320	1508320	measurements, that is the view suggested, for example, by the orthodox interpretation of this,
1508320	1515440	this is the view hold by bar, and this is a very widespread view on quantum measurements
1515440	1521360	in quantum mechanics. So those who accepted this view, I think that should not take for granted
1521360	1527360	that nature fails to respect classical physics when quantum systems violate non-contextuality
1527360	1533760	in the file. So it seems that these violations are actually our consequence of the type of
1533760	1538400	measurements we are considering. And if we accept that the measurements we have in quantum
1538400	1544480	systems are epistemic measurements, then we should be, we should not say that
1544480	1551440	nature fails to respect classical physics when these violations occur. And that's it,
1551440	1554640	that's what I had to say today. And thank you.
1555520	1566640	Thanks, Alison. Thanks for this talk. So we have some time for one short question,
1566640	1574640	because now we are on 9.56. So if someone has a question, please go on.
1575360	1587600	So I have a question or perhaps an observation, which is you can see the violation of
1589040	1596160	Bell inequalities as a particular case of a non-contextuality inequality, right? Because
1597040	1607600	and when you speak about model independence, it is not so independent of physical laws,
1607600	1614800	because in model independence, you have space-time structure. This is not the stress,
1614800	1624880	usually in the literature about it, but otherwise, if you don't consider the space-time structure,
1624880	1631360	you cannot speak about a model independence analysis of an analysis above scenario.
1632080	1636800	You cannot even speak about space-like separation between measurements, you know?
1638160	1647120	And so what I think regarding your talk is that perhaps this space-time causal structure
1647120	1656960	should be taken into account into your analysis. I agree in that if you don't take space-like
1656960	1663040	separation, you can reproduce everything with a classical mechanism. And I think that that is
1663040	1669680	accepted, right? I mean, because you have examples of contextuality in, for example,
1669680	1684160	in mathematical psychology and so on. I agree. But even so, I think that you can include
1684160	1690480	the violation of Bell inequalities as a particular example of a violation of a non-contextuality
1690480	1697760	inequality. So what do you think about that? That cannot be reproduced by any classical
1697760	1705120	mechanism. What do you think about that? Yes, I agree. So that's why I contrast, I compare
1705120	1709200	Bell inequalities with non-contextuality inequalities. So I know that Bell inequalities are
1709200	1716400	particular case of non-contextuality inequalities. But by just saying that this idea of black box
1717280	1723840	works very well if we have space-life separated parts. So I agree with it. But if we have a
1724800	1732560	black box that is localized, so as the kind of box people use when they are discussing,
1732560	1739680	for example, resource theory for contextuality. So we have this box with many inputs. So in this case,
1742080	1749600	if we have contextual data, we not necessarily have a non-classical phenomenon or something like
1749760	1759360	this. So I agree with it. So if the boxes are space-life separated, then we need non-locality.
1760880	1765920	I see your point. Okay, I will check on the details because you have a paper on this,
1765920	1772960	I've seen on the web. So I will check next week. But now we are on time. So we thank again Alison
1772960	1782240	for this nice talk. Thank you. Thanks Alison. So now we call Diego to share your screen.
1784960	1795360	So Alison, okay, great. So thanks Alison. So now we are on time for the Diego's talk.
1795360	1805440	Great, great. So now we're glad to have Diego Boussandri from the Institute of Physics La Plata
1806320	1812320	and the National University of La Plata. And he will speak about revisiting maximal
1812320	1818800	fidelity of teleportation. Please Diego, go on. Thank you very much for the presentation.
1819520	1827040	So let's talk. Diego, wait, your sound is low. You could speak like this and it's good, but if you
1827040	1833200	could. Now? Now it's much better. Thanks, thanks. Please, go on. Thank you.
1840240	1844880	Sorry. No problem, no problem.
1848880	1860160	Now, okay, let's talk about then about fidelity of teleportation. This is a work we made with
1860160	1870720	Madeira Portesi and Anna Masté. And so what did we do? We obtained the maximal average
1871680	1879120	fidelity of teleportation or the score of a given protocol for two situations, the standard
1879120	1888560	quantum teleportation protocol characterized by a particular measurement. So one second.
1888800	1900880	Now, we calculate so the maximal average fidelity of teleportation for the...
1900880	1905040	The sound is again low. I don't know if everyone is...
1907520	1914320	What happened? Now? Yeah, now it's better. Yes. Sorry, sorry. No problem.
1915200	1921680	Then we obtained the average identity in two situations, the standard quantum teleportation
1921680	1929120	protocol characterized by a particular measurement in which there is a projection onto the bell
1929120	1935760	bus. And another protocol whose characteristic measurement is something in the middle between
1935760	1946640	the computational basis and the bell, bell bus. But our differential feature is that we calculate
1946640	1957360	this for isotropic distribution of input states, not only the heart measure. I mean not only your
1957360	1972640	estimates. So we are going to talk about useful protocols. Namely, a protocol is useful when
1972640	1981280	its average fidelity is greater than the classical one. Our key point or our main result is that
1982240	1988560	when you take an average of a more general distribution than the heart measure,
1989840	1998320	the quantum teleportation protocol can be useful when your resource has no quantum correlation.
1998320	2001360	So even for a classical quantum estimate.
2001360	2012800	Well, what is the meaning of the fidelity of teleportation? Let us suppose that we have a
2012800	2021600	protocol p producing output s state given by rho a out with probability p i for an input s state
2021760	2032400	or a qubit state given by rho a. And rho a is characterized by its block vector t.
2034000	2043600	And so if you want to know how well the quantum teleportation was performed, you can quantify
2043600	2056960	the similarity between rho a and the final output, calculating equation one. But this mesh
