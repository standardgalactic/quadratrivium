00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
We're glad to have Diego Boussandri from the Institute of Physics La Plata and the National

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:16,760
University of La Plata, and he will speak about revisiting maximal fidelity of teleportation.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,680
Please Diego, go on.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,200
Thank you very much for the presentation, so let's talk.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,800
Diego, wait, your sound is low.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,800
You could speak like this, and it's good, but if you could...

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,120
Now it's much better.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
Thanks, thanks.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,920
Please, go on.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,920
Thank you, Ferri.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,240
Sorry.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,160
No problem, no problem.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:01:00,960
Now, okay, let's talk about fidelity of teleportation.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:10,960
This is a work we made with Madira Portesi and Anna MastÃ©, and so what did we do?

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,960
We obtained the maximal average fidelity of teleportation, or the score of a given protocol,

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:28,960
for two situations, the standard quantum teleportation protocol characterized by a particular measurement.

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,960
So, one second.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Now, we calculate the maximal average fidelity of teleportation for the...

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
The sound is again low.

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,960
I don't know if everyone is...

21
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
What happened?

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Now?

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
Yeah, now it's better.

24
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Yes.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Sorry, sorry.

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,960
No problem.

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,960
Then we obtained the average fidelity in two situations, the standard quantum teleportation

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,960
protocol characterized by a particular measurement in which there is a projection onto the bell

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
bus.

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,960
And another protocol whose characteristic measurement is something in the middle between

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,960
the computational buses and the bell bus.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:33,960
But our differential feature is that we calculate this for isotropic distribution of input states,

33
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,960
not only the heart measure.

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,960
I mean, not only your estates.

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:55,960
So, we are going to talk about useful protocols, namely, a protocol is useful when its average

36
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,960
fidelity is greater than the classical one.

37
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Our key point, or our main result, is that when you take an average of a more general

38
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:16,960
distribution than the heart measure, the quantum teleportation protocol can be useful when your

39
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:27,960
resource has no quantum correlation, so even for a classical quantum aspect.

40
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Well, what is the meaning of fidelity of teleportation?

41
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Let us suppose that we have a protocol P producing output estates given by Roy out with the WTPI

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,960
for an input estates or a qubit estates given by row A.

43
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,960
And row A is characterized by its block vector T.

44
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Okay.

45
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:05,960
And so, if you want to know how well the quantum teleportation was performed, you can quantify

46
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:15,960
the similarity between row A and the final output, calculating equation one.

47
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:25,960
But this measure depends basically on the input estates, I mean equation one.

48
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:35,960
So, we should take the average of your initial distribution of estates.

49
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:48,960
But now, let us suppose that we have the possibility to perform unitary operation over your final estates

50
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,960
in order to increase the fidelity.

51
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:03,960
So, let us suppose we have a protocol P producing row I, and then we perform unitary operation

52
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,960
over your conditional estates.

53
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:16,960
So, the similarity, the fidelity between your average fidelity, sorry, the a priori fidelity

54
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,960
would be writing as equation four.

55
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,960
And we can see that the red part of this measure does not depend on your unitary operations,

56
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
but the green one, yes.

57
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:41,960
So, if we want to maximize this quantity over your unitary operation, we should optimize only the green part.

58
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:53,960
So, for convenience, we will take the fidelity given by number six, a half fidelity, the green part of the average fidelity.

59
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:02,960
And in the future, we, in just in the future, we will maximize equation number six.

60
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:12,960
So, a simple question first before to continue is what is the best choice of the initial ensemble estates

61
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:21,960
if we want to study the capability or the ability or the ability of P to teleport arbitrary states.

62
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,960
A simple answer is the most random one.

63
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:34,960
This problem was first addressed by Hall, Michael Hall.

64
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:45,960
And, well, there's no unique answer to this, but a first approach is we should choose the probability measure

65
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,960
by the most symmetrical distance in the space of states.

66
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:06,960
So, if we now are talking about u-wits, we could talk about distribution within the block wall.

67
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,960
The first common one is the Hall measure that, you know, stands for the sphere of the block wall.

68
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:27,960
But also, more general, yes, more general ensemble of initial estates can be taken as, for example,

69
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:38,960
random, completely random mixed states within the block wall induced by the Hilbert Smith distance

70
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:48,960
and also the corresponding distribution to the Bure's distance.

71
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,960
So, we will compare our calculation in the quantum case with the classical case.

72
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,960
We will review, we should review first the classical teleportation protocol.

73
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:13,960
And it's a procedure that consists of a measurement over, directly over the system that you want to teleport.

74
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:23,960
And once you have the result of your measurement, you prepare an estate according to a guessing strategy.

75
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Then you have two estates, first measurement, then preparing an estate according to the information that you have obtained with this measure.

76
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:47,960
This problem was already solved for the qubit case and isotropic distribution of input state, a general one, by Vidal.

77
00:08:47,960 --> 00:09:01,960
And the solution is given by equation seven, that we have here the maximum classical, the maximum average fidelity of teleportation in the classical case.

78
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:09,960
So equation seven is the maximum over the measurements and the guessing strategies.

79
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Two common examples that we could, we could address is the hall measure, then you obtain this famous result of two thirds.

80
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:33,960
And for example, for completely mixed estate in the block wall and you obtain a different result.

81
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Now the quantum teleportation protocol consists of three qubits, A, B, and C.

82
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Our aim is to teleport the estate of qubit E to the system C.

83
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:57,960
And the first step consists in preparing a joint estate, a joint estate in the systems B and C.

84
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:06,960
The second one, we should measure jointly over the systems A and B, obtaining conditional estates.

85
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Once you have your result, you share your result to Bob, who applies the unitary confirmations in order to increase the average fidelity or the score of the protocol.

86
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:50,960
A common frame of example is when you prepare as a resource estates, as for the estate role, you prepare one of the bail estates, and you measure the bail basis in your second step.

87
00:10:50,960 --> 00:11:05,960
So if you do that, you can always find unitary transformation having fidelity one, having the final output equal to the initial one.

88
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:20,960
But in general, if you take a general measure, a general fundamental measurement, and you prepare a random or an arbitrary resource estate role,

89
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:42,960
you obtain as conditional estates of your protocol raw CI, the following general expressions given by the marginal vectors and the covariant matrices of your measurements, states, your projections, and your resource estates.

90
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:59,960
So the conditional block vectors are given by equation nine. These vectors are before to apply the unitary transformation, the unitary correction.

91
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:15,960
So before to continue, we should define first the fully entangled fraction that is measure of quantum correlation in bipartite estates.

92
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:27,960
So for example, here raw is a general bipartite estate, and equation 10 stands for the correlation of this particular estate.

93
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Why we define this? Because the quantum teleportation protocol has associated a fidelity, a maximum average fidelity, that is proportional to this fully entangled fraction.

94
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:57,960
So here we have the average fidelity for the measurement, the projection onto the bell basis.

95
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:04,960
And here we have the half measure, only pure estates.

96
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:26,960
So this is a general rule in quantum teleportation that states that if you have separable, for example, estates as a resource of the protocol, then your protocol is not useful, namely, you cannot overcome the classical fidelity with this particular protocol.

97
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:39,960
If you want to have a useful protocol, you should have entanglement in your resource.

98
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:48,960
But these results are always for the Hermitian, always for pure estates.

99
00:13:48,960 --> 00:14:04,960
So now we will maximize the average fidelity in a more general situation considering an ensemble of initial estates that could include mixed estates.

100
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:33,960
So in order to do that, we should use the general expression we saw before, and we should calculate this scalar product between T that is the block vector that we want to copy with the a priori final conditional block vectors.

101
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:49,960
So the good news here is that the vector omega here in green does not depend on T, and the matrix A does not depend on T also.

102
00:14:49,960 --> 00:15:02,960
So we could use the inequalities given in equation 13 to obtain the average fidelity.

103
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:22,960
But if we want to maximize the equation 14, we should maximize the trace of A because A has the rotations corresponding to the unitary operations.

104
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:51,960
But here we have another good news that is our optimization problem does not depend on the purity because the purity of your ensemble is concentrated here in number alpha given by equation 14.

105
00:15:52,960 --> 00:16:06,960
So if you, you can, we can use the known solution for input estates.

106
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:24,960
So this is the general solution for the standard quantum teleportation protocol and considering a distribution, a random distribution of input estates.

107
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Let us take now particular example, particular resource estates in order to see what happened with the average fidelity comparing with the classical one.

108
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Let us take now as a resource estates, a belt diagonal estates, so the new expression we will have is this one.

109
00:16:51,960 --> 00:17:01,960
And if we take a Werner estate as the resource of the protocol, we have this average fidelity.

110
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:19,960
And the good news here is that if we take, for example, the random distribution of initial estates, the completely random distribution in the block wall induced by the Hilbert Smith norm, we can obtain the analytical spectrum.

111
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:31,960
So the question now is, is the protocol is useful only when the resource is entangled, so the quick answer is that no.

112
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,960
And we have this picture, this figure.

113
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Here we have the average fidelity.

114
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:50,960
And then, and this part is correspond to separable Werner estates.

115
00:17:51,960 --> 00:18:07,960
And the horizontal line correspond to the average, the classical average fidelity. So we have an entire range of separable estates overcoming the classical fidelity.

116
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:19,960
So we have a resource without entanglement and we are overcoming the classical, the classical average fidelity.

117
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:28,960
For a random distribution, a completely random distribution in the block wall.

118
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:44,960
So now the question is, if the quantum-discord like correlation are responsible or not for overcoming the classical average fidelity, because here we have this score, for example.

119
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,960
We have quantum correlation, we have separable estates, but there is quantum-discord.

120
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,960
And again, the answer is no.

121
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:13,960
And in order to see this, we will take a classical quantum, build the diagonal estates, the expression of the average fidelity given by the question 17.

122
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,960
And it corresponds to this, to this curve.

123
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:30,960
We have again an entire range of resource estates, classical quantum resource estates overcoming the classical, the classical fidelity.

124
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,960
So now the question is, what's happened here?

125
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:58,960
And in order to answer this, we consider another protocol that whose characteristics measurement, whose characteristic measurement is something, is a von Neumann measurement, that it is in the middle between the computational basis and the bell basis.

126
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:09,960
So in this new protocol, we can take off the entanglement of the measurement and see what happens.

127
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,960
The expression is this one.

128
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Here we have the estates in which we will project the measurement.

129
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:28,960
We can quantify the entanglement only with one number, Cn.

130
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,960
And what is the time?

131
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,960
And we can solve this problem only for bell diagonal resource.

132
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:49,960
And I said, solve the problem is we could maximize the average fidelity.

133
00:20:49,960 --> 00:21:04,960
And if we consider the hard measure, if we consider the hard measure, namely only pure estates as initial estates of the protocol.

134
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Here we have the estates, the bell diagonal estates that are not useful depending on the measurement.

135
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:32,960
So when the measurement is the bell basis, sorry, here we should take Cn equal to 1.

136
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,960
In this situation, we are in a standard quantum teleportation protocol.

137
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:54,960
We see that if you do not have entanglement, so you can do anything because these estates are corresponding to an unusual protocol.

138
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:05,960
But we can see that if we take off the entanglement of the measurement, this volume of this set increases.

139
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:17,960
And if your measurement has no quantum correlation, has no correlation at all, as for example for the computational basis that is this case.

140
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,960
So you have always your protocol will be not useful.

141
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:38,960
But when you consider, for example, an ensemble of a completely random initial estates, the entire block ball, the situation change.

142
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:53,960
And you have this picture in which we have here the Eberner estates as a resource and these codes correspond to take off the entanglement.

143
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Here Cn is equal to 1 and here Cn is equal to 0.

144
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,960
This horizontal line corresponds to the classical protocol.

145
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:22,960
So we have here a lot of situations in which you can overcome the classical fidelity and not always for the bell basis.

146
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:36,960
This is the same picture as before, but considering another resource, a classical quantum bell diagonal estate.

147
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:54,960
And we see the same because every line here corresponds to a protocol with a measurement less correlated with a less correlated measurement.

148
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:10,960
And we see that the most important feature of a general protocol is the correlation in the measurement because if you do not have any correlation in your measurement,

149
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:27,960
so you cannot find a resource estate in order to overcome the classical fidelity.

150
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:35,960
And well, I think that's all thanks for listening.

151
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Thanks Diego, thanks Diego for this talk.

152
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Now, if there are some questions, please let me know that right in in the chat or you can just jump in and do it.
