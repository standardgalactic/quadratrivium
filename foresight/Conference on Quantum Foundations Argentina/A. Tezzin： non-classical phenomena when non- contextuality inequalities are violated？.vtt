00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
Thanks, and now we move on to the next speaker of this morning's session with Alison Desin.

00:08.320 --> 00:12.080
Please, Alison, if you can start sharing your screen.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.280
Can you hear me?

00:20.000 --> 00:25.040
Yes, perfectly. And also, perhaps it's better if you put a full screen mode.

00:25.680 --> 00:26.000
Okay.

00:26.240 --> 00:36.560
Okay. Okay, so the next speaker is Alison Desin from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil,

00:37.360 --> 00:44.960
and he's talking about are we witnessing non-local phenomena when non-contextuality inequalities

00:44.960 --> 00:53.360
are violated? Please, Alison, go on. Okay, so I'd like to thank the organizers for having

00:53.360 --> 01:01.040
attended my talk, and congratulations for this very nice conference, and it's a pleasure to be here.

01:01.760 --> 01:09.120
And so, as you see, this talk is about a question, and the question is if we are witnessing

01:09.120 --> 01:14.800
non-classical phenomena when non-contextuality inequalities are violated? And I would like

01:14.800 --> 01:21.120
to begin this presentation by just finding this question. And in order to do that, I will show

01:21.760 --> 01:27.360
a couple of examples of very recent papers where this claim is made. So the claim that

01:27.360 --> 01:34.160
contextuality, which means by which I mean the violation of a non-contextuality inequality,

01:34.160 --> 01:42.880
is some kind of signature of non-classicality. So these are the examples. So contextuality is a

01:42.880 --> 01:49.600
non-classical behavior that can be exhibited by quantum systems. It's a non-classical feature

01:49.600 --> 01:55.840
challenging everyday intuition. It's a non-classical property exhibited by quantum statistics.

01:57.040 --> 02:02.640
It's a key signature of non-classicality. And finally, it's their catapult on classical

02:02.640 --> 02:10.560
feature of quantum phenomenology. So we know that this is a common view. And in order to contrast

02:10.560 --> 02:16.640
contextuality and classicality, let me explain what I mean by classicality. And I will do that

02:16.640 --> 02:26.720
basically by quoting this paper. And the main point is that as I see it, a criterion for classicality

02:26.720 --> 02:34.160
must have a phenomenological meaning. So as they say in this paper, a criterion of classicality

02:34.880 --> 02:41.920
must allow us to say that in some sense, nature fails to respect classical physics.

02:42.880 --> 02:49.280
So non-classical phenomena must defy classical understanding. And this is basically what I

02:49.280 --> 02:56.800
expect from a criterion of classicality. So we can now rephrase our initial question,

02:56.800 --> 03:04.400
just to be more explicitly. And we are asking if nature fails to respect classical physics when

03:04.400 --> 03:12.080
non-contextuality and equivalence are violated. Okay, so now let's discuss non-contextuality and

03:12.080 --> 03:19.120
equivalence. And this definition of contextuality that is the violation of non-contextuality and

03:19.120 --> 03:25.280
equivalence, it's a very operational definition in the sense that it's a definition we apply for

03:25.280 --> 03:40.880
experimental data. So contextuality. Wait, wait, there's something I will try to move Federico.

03:41.840 --> 03:46.480
Everyone please move their phones. Sorry, Allison, please go on. Okay.

03:46.480 --> 03:56.880
Okay, so as I said, this is an operational definition, the sense that it's a label we

03:56.880 --> 04:04.400
apply for experimental data. And this idea of contextuality as something that we can apply

04:04.400 --> 04:12.800
for data with no reference to the underlying structure of the mechanism we are working with,

04:13.440 --> 04:19.120
it's a definition that arises in the context of this model independent approach to physics.

04:19.920 --> 04:27.040
So I will discuss this model independent approach very briefly because I think some

04:27.040 --> 04:34.800
of you may not be familiar with it. And the core idea behind model independent approach to physics

04:34.800 --> 04:42.480
is this idea of a black box. And a black box is a measurement setup. And we say we call it a

04:42.480 --> 04:49.280
black box because we assume that we can ignore the underlying structure of this setup and we can

04:49.280 --> 04:55.440
look onto the data. So as Popesco says, according to this view, the entire physics should be

04:55.440 --> 05:02.400
encapsulated in the data. And we can discuss, for example, locality from this perspective. So

05:03.680 --> 05:08.880
we can discuss locality beyond quantum mechanics. So with no reference to quantum systems. So all

05:08.880 --> 05:16.480
we need are devices and measurements that are outputs. And we can also discuss contextuality

05:16.480 --> 05:22.080
in this perspective. And this is exactly the definition of contextuality that is based on

05:22.080 --> 05:28.640
non-contextuality in equities. So contextuality is the violation of non-contextuality in equities,

05:28.640 --> 05:35.840
just as non-locality is the violation of the inequalities. Or we can equivalently say that

05:35.840 --> 05:43.760
contextuality corresponds to the existence of global sections. So this is equivalent to say

05:43.760 --> 05:55.200
that contextuality is the violation of non-contextuality in equities. And just to make it clear that

05:55.200 --> 06:00.400
this idea of black box appears in contextuality analysis, I will show two examples. So here they

06:00.400 --> 06:05.840
say that we have a black box and that the agent consumes the box by simultaneously performing

06:05.840 --> 06:12.880
a subset of measurements. And a subset of measurements that we can simultaneously perform is what we

06:12.880 --> 06:21.360
call a context. And here they say the same. So we have a black box that is a device containing

06:21.360 --> 06:27.280
buttons and lights. And buttons represent measurements and lights represent outcomes

06:27.280 --> 06:32.800
or outputs. And we have contexts that are collections of buttons that we can press jointly.

06:33.760 --> 06:39.520
And okay, so these are some pictures representing this idea of black box in contextuality analysis.

06:39.520 --> 06:44.720
So here we see that we have a black box with inputs that are buttons or measurements and

06:44.720 --> 06:53.360
outputs that are represented as lights. So okay, so this is basically this this model

06:53.440 --> 07:02.000
independent view. And now we will show a particular example of black box. And we will discuss this

07:02.000 --> 07:09.440
example using the compatibility hypergraph approach to contextuality. That is one of many

07:09.440 --> 07:15.520
model independent approach to contextuality analysis. And we have to introduce a measurement

07:15.520 --> 07:21.680
scenario in order to define a black box. And the measurement scenario we consider is a very

07:21.680 --> 07:25.120
standard example of a measurement scenario in contextuality analysis.

07:26.880 --> 07:33.200
That is the device cycle. So in this scenario, we have only five measurements. And all measurements

07:33.200 --> 07:39.200
of this scenario are binary. So they have only two possible outcomes. So one and zero. And this is

07:39.200 --> 07:46.880
the symbol we call one. And this is the symbol we call zero. Okay, and we also have to define

07:46.960 --> 07:53.760
a context. So we call that a context represents a collection of measurements that can be measured

07:53.760 --> 08:00.080
simultaneously. And these are the contexts we consider in the five cycle. So a context in

08:00.080 --> 08:06.880
this scenario is a pair of consecutive measurements. So for example, a one, a two is a context,

08:06.880 --> 08:13.520
a three, a four is a context, a four, a zero is not a context, and so on. So we have five contexts.

08:13.520 --> 08:21.040
And as I said, this is a very standard example of measurement scenario for contextuality analysis.

08:21.040 --> 08:27.680
So these measurements are like the buttons of our black box. And now we have to introduce

08:27.680 --> 08:35.120
a behavior for this scenario. That is the data our black box generates. And the behavior we consider

08:35.120 --> 08:42.960
is a very famous example of contextual behavior in the five cycle. And the behavior and it's

08:42.960 --> 08:50.160
this behavior. So by definition in contextual analysis, the behavior of a scenario is context

08:50.160 --> 08:54.960
dependent. So we associate a probability distribution for each context. And this is the

08:54.960 --> 09:02.080
distribution we associate for a context in the five cycle. So, so if we measure together AI and AI

09:02.080 --> 09:09.840
plus one, we will never obtain the same outcome. And the probability of obtaining zero one or one

09:09.840 --> 09:15.200
zero is the same. And this is this is the data our black box generates. So this is the behavior of

09:15.200 --> 09:22.880
our box of our box. And okay, and what we can say about this behavior. So first of all, it's not

09:22.880 --> 09:30.160
disturbing, which means that according to this behavior, it means that a measurement has the

09:30.160 --> 09:36.560
same distribution across all contexts. And moreover, according to this behavior, a measurement

09:36.560 --> 09:42.480
behaves like a coin toss. And this is one of the reasons why we are calling this behavior a

09:42.480 --> 09:50.560
generalized coin toss. This behavior is an example of stronger than quantum correlation,

09:50.560 --> 09:55.920
which means that quantum theory cannot predict this behavior. And finally, this behavior is

09:55.920 --> 10:02.000
contextual. So it violates a non contextuality inequality or equivalently, we cannot define

10:02.000 --> 10:07.600
a global section for this behavior. So it means that we cannot define a probability distribution,

10:07.600 --> 10:13.760
including all measurements of this scenario that is capable of predicting this behavior. So, and

10:17.040 --> 10:23.040
this is an example of a maximum contextual behavior in the five cycle. And this is why this

10:23.120 --> 10:30.720
example is very famous. Okay. And in the in the compatibility

10:30.720 --> 10:36.800
hydrograph approach, contextuality and nonclassicality are equivalence definitions. So according to

10:36.800 --> 10:42.880
this approach, if our black box generates this this data, then then we have to say that our

10:42.880 --> 10:51.600
black box generates non classical correlations. Okay. So thus far, we have discussed contextuality

10:51.600 --> 10:59.440
from this model independent view. And we have showed a very famous example of contextual behavior

10:59.440 --> 11:04.720
in the five cycle. So this is the data our box generate. And this is the data we are going to

11:04.720 --> 11:14.480
analyze. Okay, but now I will let's let's look inside the the box. And your and to begin with,

11:14.480 --> 11:19.920
I would like to compare on the balance with contextuality and equities because

11:20.000 --> 11:27.280
as I said, contextuality, according to this definition is the violation of non contextuality

11:27.280 --> 11:33.360
and equities, just as no locality is the violation of very equities from this model

11:33.360 --> 11:37.760
independent perspective. So let's compare these two definitions. So suppose we have

11:39.680 --> 11:44.960
a bell scenario. So it's a scenario containing two space like separated parts. So each part has

11:44.960 --> 11:50.000
a black box, and each part is performing measurements, and they are generating data

11:50.000 --> 11:54.320
together. And we analyze this data. And if it is data violate a bell inequality,

11:54.960 --> 11:59.600
we can say that we are witnessing a non local phenomenon, which means that

12:01.600 --> 12:06.960
and locality or non locality is a physical concept in the sense that we can define it

12:06.960 --> 12:12.560
in terms of physical principles. For example, we can define locality using using special

12:12.560 --> 12:21.120
relativity. And in this case, so in this case, the data we have is is intrinsically associated

12:21.120 --> 12:26.320
with a physical phenomenon. And we can really ignore the underlying structure of these boxes.

12:26.880 --> 12:32.400
So this this measurements, they can be, for example, questions, yes, no questions we ask for

12:32.400 --> 12:39.280
these agents. And these outputs can be answers they give. And if it in this case, if this

12:40.160 --> 12:44.560
if these bell inequalities are violated, we can say that we are we are witnessing

12:45.280 --> 12:49.680
no local phenomenon. So there is this physical phenomenon associated to the data we have.

12:50.960 --> 12:58.160
But in contextual analysis, we have no physical phenomenon associated to it, because

12:58.880 --> 13:04.720
contextuality according to this model independence definition is not a physical phenomenon,

13:04.800 --> 13:10.560
because we cannot define it in terms of physical principles. So it would not be a surprise if

13:11.280 --> 13:16.240
inside a box generating non classical correlations are contextual correlations,

13:16.240 --> 13:24.880
we had a a a simple classical structure. And, and I will try to show now that

13:24.880 --> 13:29.200
this is the case for the behavior we we we called a generalized coin toss.

13:29.200 --> 13:38.960
Okay, and before we go through the example, I would like to say three things about it.

13:38.960 --> 13:45.280
So first of all, recall that we are assuming here that everything is encapsulated in the data.

13:45.280 --> 13:50.880
So we can, in some sense, ignore the ignore the underlying structure of this black box.

13:50.880 --> 13:56.720
So a black box is a very permissive concept. So it may contain an entire laboratory containing

13:56.720 --> 14:06.880
particles and measuring devices. And also the the the mechanism we propose is basically a

14:06.880 --> 14:15.040
toy mechanism for coin tossing. And coin tossing is is according to many operational

14:15.040 --> 14:19.360
approach to physics, it's a valid example of measurement procedure. So for example,

14:20.800 --> 14:23.360
people who work with packing context reality and

14:23.440 --> 14:29.920
generalize the probability theories, they are all the time using coin tossing as an example of

14:29.920 --> 14:36.960
measuring procedure that is valid. So that's why we say that this mechanism works along the line

14:36.960 --> 14:43.360
set out in many operational approach. So according to these approach, if we had inside a black box

14:43.360 --> 14:51.920
a coin coin flip a coin tossing, it would be a valid measurement procedure. And more importantly,

14:52.880 --> 14:59.440
this this mechanism is something like a thought experiment. So we are trying to show that unlike

14:59.440 --> 15:04.240
no local data, no contextual data can be generated by a simple classical mechanism.

15:04.240 --> 15:09.680
So this mechanism should be understood as a thought experiment. So it's not a mechanism

15:09.680 --> 15:17.200
that is interesting by itself. So okay, now let's go through the the mechanism. And as I said,

15:17.200 --> 15:21.600
it's it's basically a toy mechanism for coin tossing. And how can we describe

15:24.080 --> 15:32.240
a coin toss using toy mechanism. So we need an object. So in the in the real world, we we use

15:32.240 --> 15:39.120
a coin that is an object has that for all practical purposes has two sides. So here in this time

15:39.120 --> 15:45.760
mechanism, we consider for the sake of simplicity, a 2D object, and each has two sides. So one side

15:45.760 --> 15:55.520
is dark gray, the other side is light gray. And we have we need to flip this object. So we fix an

15:55.520 --> 16:01.200
axis passing through the center of this object, and we flip this object. And at the end of the

16:01.200 --> 16:07.920
movement, we look to the side that is showing when the coin lands. So this is the real case.

16:07.920 --> 16:14.960
So in this toy mechanism, we we we fix this side of the object. So and we imagine that this is a

16:14.960 --> 16:22.320
sensor and the sensor can detect color that in this case is gray. And it can distinguish dark

16:22.320 --> 16:29.360
from light color. So we have these two outputs. So these outputs are like hazard tails. So they

16:29.360 --> 16:36.160
they are dark gray or light gray. And the behavior we obtain if we perform these measurements,

16:36.160 --> 16:41.360
these measurements. So if we flip this coin is the behavior of a fair conflict, because this

16:41.360 --> 16:48.400
mechanism is is constructed for for this purpose. So okay, so this is a toy mechanism for coin toss.

16:50.080 --> 16:57.120
And the point is that we can propose a straightforward generalization of this mechanism

16:57.840 --> 17:03.600
that is capable of generating the the behavior we call a generalized coin toss that, as I said,

17:03.600 --> 17:09.280
is a very famous example of contextual correlation, contextuality analysis.

17:10.960 --> 17:19.600
So a coin toss, we have one binary measurement. So we need an object having one pair of positive

17:19.600 --> 17:26.640
sides. But in the generalized coin toss, we have five pairs of positives. So we have five binary

17:26.640 --> 17:32.720
measurements. So we need an object having five pairs of positive sides. So it could be something

17:32.720 --> 17:42.560
like an unsided dice or something like this. And but we are proposing just a toy mechanism. So we

17:42.560 --> 17:48.800
consider a 2D object. And this is a regular decadent. And for each pair of positive sides,

17:48.800 --> 17:55.920
we associate a measurement. And for for its measurement, we associate a color. And okay,

17:55.920 --> 18:04.800
and the measurement procedure inside of this box is a coin flipping. But the the the flipping is

18:04.800 --> 18:12.240
determined in this case by the context. So the context in this toy mechanism is an axis passing

18:12.240 --> 18:18.480
through the center of the object. And together with a sensor and the sensor can detect color and

18:18.480 --> 18:24.400
it can distinguish that from each color. So for example, if we want to measure a two and a three

18:24.400 --> 18:31.840
together, if we press these buttons in our box, this mechanism will just flip this coin. But with

18:31.840 --> 18:37.520
respect to the axis that they're mined by this context, so this is the axis, this vertical line.

18:38.240 --> 18:43.760
And if we do that, we can obtain two possible outcomes. So we can detect dark yellow and

18:43.760 --> 18:49.600
light green, or we can detect light yellow and dark green. So we can never detect, for example,

18:49.600 --> 18:53.920
dark yellow and dark green because they are in a positive side of this object. So

18:53.920 --> 19:00.080
this is a mere geometrical restriction of the object. And this is why we have this,

19:00.080 --> 19:04.800
we have the correlation that is predicted by the generalized coin toss in this context.

19:06.160 --> 19:12.160
And this is the mechanism we have. So each context is an axis together with a sensor. And

19:12.160 --> 19:20.480
whatever is the context we consider, we have only these two possible outcomes and the behavior is

19:20.480 --> 19:28.240
the behavior we call a generalized coin toss. Okay. And we also must be able to measure single,

19:28.240 --> 19:32.400
to perform single measurements. And in order to do that, we have to fix a context.

19:33.600 --> 19:38.320
So this is the general case in contextual analysis. So for example, if we want to measure

19:38.960 --> 19:45.360
these measurements, A0, that is red, we have two options. So we have two contexts containing A0,

19:45.360 --> 19:49.760
and we have to choose one of them. So we can choose, for example, this context,

19:49.760 --> 19:56.320
and we just flip this object. And so we have two possible outcomes, so dark red or light red,

19:56.320 --> 20:04.080
and the behavior is the behavior of a fair coin slip. So to sum up, this mechanism, this time

20:04.160 --> 20:10.560
mechanism, or just thought experiment, generates the behavior we call a generalized coin toss.

20:12.240 --> 20:19.440
And okay, and what we can say based on this example, based on this thought experiment.

20:19.440 --> 20:23.200
So first of all, let's discuss contextuality beyond content theory.

20:25.840 --> 20:30.880
Okay, so the first point is that without clear specification of what measurement means,

20:30.880 --> 20:35.840
contextuality has no phenomenological significance. It means that the meaning of

20:35.840 --> 20:40.480
contextuality or the phenomenological meaning depends on what we mean by a measurement.

20:41.280 --> 20:48.080
So in contextual analysis, the underlying structure matters. So we cannot say that,

20:48.880 --> 20:55.360
I think that based on this thought experiment, I think this thought experiment suggests that we

20:55.360 --> 21:02.240
cannot ignore the underlying structure in order, when we are analyzing data from this

21:02.240 --> 21:10.320
perspective of contextuality. Which means that in contextuality analysis, the entire physics

21:10.320 --> 21:18.800
does not seem to be encapsulated in the data. So what we mean by measurement is important.

21:19.520 --> 21:26.480
And finally, contextuality, at least beyond content theory, does not require a non-classical

21:26.480 --> 21:34.320
phenomenon. Okay, and can we say something about contextuality in content theory,

21:35.120 --> 21:41.840
based on this thought experiment? And I think we can. So note that in our thought experiment,

21:42.480 --> 21:50.160
we are working with a classical object. So it's basically a coin. So

21:52.880 --> 21:58.400
it's a classical object in the sense that it's a rigid body. So it's just a thought mechanism.

21:58.400 --> 22:07.440
So we say it's a 2D object, but we can imagine it as a real body, just as we imagine a coin as

22:07.600 --> 22:14.240
a rigid body. And okay, so we have this classical object and measurements, our measurement procedures

22:14.240 --> 22:20.160
are not revealing perverts processed by the system. And also we have context. So not all

22:20.160 --> 22:25.760
measurements can be simultaneously performed. So we have this restriction that is an

22:25.760 --> 22:31.760
instrumental restriction. So this is part of our mechanism. So it means that in our

22:32.480 --> 22:37.920
experiment, we are working with measurements that I like to co-example, that are measurements

22:38.960 --> 22:41.760
that are not revealing perverts processed by a system.

22:43.760 --> 22:52.640
And we know that this view on measurement is a very common view on content measurements,

22:52.640 --> 22:56.640
because we have Cauchy's Becker theorem. And Cauchy's Becker theorem says that

22:57.280 --> 23:01.840
self-adjoint operators cannot be thought of as representing perverts simultaneously

23:01.840 --> 23:09.360
processed by a system. So Cauchy's Becker theorem suggests some kind of substantive

23:09.360 --> 23:14.160
view on measurements. So we have to accept that measurements are not revealing perverts

23:14.160 --> 23:20.000
processed by a system, or at least that they are not revealing perverts that are

23:20.960 --> 23:26.880
simultaneously processed by the system. But the point is that if the measurements we have

23:26.880 --> 23:32.160
are epistemic, so if the measurements we have are not revealing perverts of a system,

23:32.160 --> 23:39.360
then we have contextuality in the data. So the data our system generates will violate

23:39.360 --> 23:43.600
non-contextuality and equivalence. And it's not because the system is non-classical or it's classical,

23:43.600 --> 23:49.280
it's because measurements are epistemic. And the reasons that epistemic measurements cannot be

23:49.280 --> 23:54.960
defined as random variables share in the same sample space. So we cannot define the

23:54.960 --> 24:01.840
measurements because the measurements that are like coin flippings in our thought experiment,

24:01.840 --> 24:07.040
we cannot represent those measurements as random variables in the same sample space.

24:08.080 --> 24:17.680
And that's why we have contextuality in content systems, I think. And we must recall that

24:17.680 --> 24:25.120
KS theorem, Cauchy-Specker theorem is about realism, it's not about classicality. So to sum up,

24:26.320 --> 24:33.440
in quantum mechanics, we have, so in general, actually, if we have epistemic measurements,

24:33.440 --> 24:37.360
or if we have measurements that are not revealing perverts processed by a system,

24:37.360 --> 24:42.800
and if we have context, so if we have these restrictions on what we can measure jointly,

24:43.440 --> 24:49.200
then we have contextual data. So we have no ground for expecting non-contextuality in the data,

24:49.200 --> 24:55.200
because our measurements are not random variables in the same sample space. So

24:56.160 --> 25:02.320
I think that this thought experiment suggests that those who accept the epistemic view on

25:02.320 --> 25:08.320
measurements, that is the view suggested, for example, by the orthodox interpretation of this,

25:08.320 --> 25:15.440
this is the view hold by bar, and this is a very widespread view on quantum measurements

25:15.440 --> 25:21.360
in quantum mechanics. So those who accepted this view, I think that should not take for granted

25:21.360 --> 25:27.360
that nature fails to respect classical physics when quantum systems violate non-contextuality

25:27.360 --> 25:33.760
in the file. So it seems that these violations are actually our consequence of the type of

25:33.760 --> 25:38.400
measurements we are considering. And if we accept that the measurements we have in quantum

25:38.400 --> 25:44.480
systems are epistemic measurements, then we should be, we should not say that

25:44.480 --> 25:51.440
nature fails to respect classical physics when these violations occur. And that's it,

25:51.440 --> 25:54.640
that's what I had to say today. And thank you.

25:55.520 --> 26:06.640
Thanks, Alison. Thanks for this talk. So we have some time for one short question,

26:06.640 --> 26:14.640
because now we are on 9.56. So if someone has a question, please go on.

26:15.360 --> 26:27.600
So I have a question or perhaps an observation, which is you can see the violation of

26:29.040 --> 26:36.160
Bell inequalities as a particular case of a non-contextuality inequality, right? Because

26:37.040 --> 26:47.600
and when you speak about model independence, it is not so independent of physical laws,

26:47.600 --> 26:54.800
because in model independence, you have space-time structure. This is not the stress,

26:54.800 --> 27:04.880
usually in the literature about it, but otherwise, if you don't consider the space-time structure,

27:04.880 --> 27:11.360
you cannot speak about a model independence analysis of an analysis above scenario.

27:12.080 --> 27:16.800
You cannot even speak about space-like separation between measurements, you know?

27:18.160 --> 27:27.120
And so what I think regarding your talk is that perhaps this space-time causal structure

27:27.120 --> 27:36.960
should be taken into account into your analysis. I agree in that if you don't take space-like

27:36.960 --> 27:43.040
separation, you can reproduce everything with a classical mechanism. And I think that that is

27:43.040 --> 27:49.680
accepted, right? I mean, because you have examples of contextuality in, for example,

27:49.680 --> 28:04.160
in mathematical psychology and so on. I agree. But even so, I think that you can include

28:04.160 --> 28:10.480
the violation of Bell inequalities as a particular example of a violation of a non-contextuality

28:10.480 --> 28:17.760
inequality. So what do you think about that? That cannot be reproduced by any classical

28:17.760 --> 28:25.120
mechanism. What do you think about that? Yes, I agree. So that's why I contrast, I compare

28:25.120 --> 28:29.200
Bell inequalities with non-contextuality inequalities. So I know that Bell inequalities are

28:29.200 --> 28:36.400
particular case of non-contextuality inequalities. But by just saying that this idea of black box

28:37.280 --> 28:43.840
works very well if we have space-life separated parts. So I agree with it. But if we have a

28:44.800 --> 28:52.560
black box that is localized, so as the kind of box people use when they are discussing,

28:52.560 --> 28:59.680
for example, resource theory for contextuality. So we have this box with many inputs. So in this case,

29:02.080 --> 29:09.600
if we have contextual data, we not necessarily have a non-classical phenomenon or something like

29:09.760 --> 29:19.360
this. So I agree with it. So if the boxes are space-life separated, then we need non-locality.

29:20.880 --> 29:25.920
I see your point. Okay, I will check on the details because you have a paper on this,

29:25.920 --> 29:32.960
I've seen on the web. So I will check next week. But now we are on time. So we thank again Alison

29:32.960 --> 29:42.240
for this nice talk. Thank you. Thanks Alison. So now we call Diego to share your screen.

29:44.960 --> 29:55.360
So Alison, okay, great. So thanks Alison. So now we are on time for the Diego's talk.

29:55.360 --> 30:05.440
Great, great. So now we're glad to have Diego Boussandri from the Institute of Physics La Plata

30:06.320 --> 30:12.320
and the National University of La Plata. And he will speak about revisiting maximal

30:12.320 --> 30:18.800
fidelity of teleportation. Please Diego, go on. Thank you very much for the presentation.

30:19.520 --> 30:27.040
So let's talk. Diego, wait, your sound is low. You could speak like this and it's good, but if you

30:27.040 --> 30:33.200
could. Now? Now it's much better. Thanks, thanks. Please, go on. Thank you.

30:40.240 --> 30:44.880
Sorry. No problem, no problem.

30:48.880 --> 31:00.160
Now, okay, let's talk about then about fidelity of teleportation. This is a work we made with

31:00.160 --> 31:10.720
Madeira Portesi and Anna Masté. And so what did we do? We obtained the maximal average

31:11.680 --> 31:19.120
fidelity of teleportation or the score of a given protocol for two situations, the standard

31:19.120 --> 31:28.560
quantum teleportation protocol characterized by a particular measurement. So one second.

31:28.800 --> 31:40.880
Now, we calculate so the maximal average fidelity of teleportation for the...

31:40.880 --> 31:45.040
The sound is again low. I don't know if everyone is...

31:47.520 --> 31:54.320
What happened? Now? Yeah, now it's better. Yes. Sorry, sorry. No problem.

31:55.200 --> 32:01.680
Then we obtained the average identity in two situations, the standard quantum teleportation

32:01.680 --> 32:09.120
protocol characterized by a particular measurement in which there is a projection onto the bell

32:09.120 --> 32:15.760
bus. And another protocol whose characteristic measurement is something in the middle between

32:15.760 --> 32:26.640
the computational basis and the bell, bell bus. But our differential feature is that we calculate

32:26.640 --> 32:37.360
this for isotropic distribution of input states, not only the heart measure. I mean not only your

32:37.360 --> 32:52.640
estimates. So we are going to talk about useful protocols. Namely, a protocol is useful when

32:52.640 --> 33:01.280
its average fidelity is greater than the classical one. Our key point or our main result is that

33:02.240 --> 33:08.560
when you take an average of a more general distribution than the heart measure,

33:09.840 --> 33:18.320
the quantum teleportation protocol can be useful when your resource has no quantum correlation.

33:18.320 --> 33:21.360
So even for a classical quantum estimate.

33:21.360 --> 33:32.800
Well, what is the meaning of the fidelity of teleportation? Let us suppose that we have a

33:32.800 --> 33:41.600
protocol p producing output s state given by rho a out with probability p i for an input s state

33:41.760 --> 33:52.400
or a qubit state given by rho a. And rho a is characterized by its block vector t.

33:54.000 --> 34:03.600
And so if you want to know how well the quantum teleportation was performed, you can quantify

34:03.600 --> 34:16.960
the similarity between rho a and the final output, calculating equation one. But this mesh
