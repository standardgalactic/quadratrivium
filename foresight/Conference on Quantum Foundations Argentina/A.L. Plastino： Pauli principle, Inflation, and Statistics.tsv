0	4000	Okay, welcome to the last session of the day.
4000	22000	The next talk is in charge of Angelo Platino from the National University of La Plata, with the talk of Pauli Pr√≠ncipe and Inflation.
22000	27000	Good afternoon everybody.
27000	38000	There is no doubt that Pauli principle is one important piece of the foundations of quantum mechanics.
38000	56000	On the other hand, cosmic inflation is one phenomenon associated to the big bang that helps to explain
56000	67000	the large features of our universe that would be quite a mystery without cosmic inflation.
67000	80000	Cosmic inflation has been invented 40 years ago, exactly in 1991 by Alan Goose.
80000	90000	Okay, so this talk will try to connect the Pauli principle with cosmic inflation.
90000	111000	This work has two co-authors, which are Mario Roca from my University of La Plata and Gustavo Ferri from the University of La Pampa, which is also in Argentina, some 800 kilometers from La Plata.
111000	119000	And it was published in the middle of the pandemics in July of last year.
119000	125000	Here is the reference.
125000	140000	Okay, let's first of all try to briefly say what all this is about.
140000	163000	We are trying to connect a basic concept of quantum mechanics that is the Pauli principle with a cosmic phenomenon which is cosmic inflation and with elementary statistical mechanics, very elementary statistical mechanics.
163000	173000	And we begin with the number of microstates.
173000	188000	And the assertion that because of the Pauli principles, a given number of fermions cannot be accommodated into arbitrarily small volumes V.
188000	197000	So a minimum volume is needed to accommodate and fermions.
197000	211000	That doesn't happen with motions, you can accommodate and motions in several volume, but this cannot happen with fermions, why because of the Pauli principle.
211000	224000	And in this talk, I will try to connect what I just said about volumes with cosmic inflation.
224000	231000	So the idea, the central idea is that to accommodate and fermions into a slightly determinant.
231000	250000	That's the way one word fermions with slightly determinants, we need a minimum radius, which is a consequence of the Pauli principle, and we will extrapolate this ordinary simple statistical feature.
250000	255000	We will extrapolate it to a cosmological setting.
255000	271000	And we will be able to predict a special temperature value for the end of inflation, which agrees with the current estimates.
271000	279000	Again, cosmic inflation is a widely accepted phenomenon, we need it.
279000	295000	We slowly needed to understand the large features of the universe, but the details that particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation is unknown.
295000	315000	So the basic paradigm accepted by most people in physics is that there was an exponential expansion of the universe very shortly after the singularity generated in the big bang.
315000	325000	10 to the minus 36 seconds to 10 to the minus 32 seconds.
325000	343000	And we will appeal now to micro canonical statistical mechanics to link the Pauli principle with the inflation, the cosmic inflation process.
343000	353000	So in all this talk, I will be using the micro canonical.
353000	363000	For example, of Gibbs, you know, there are three big ones, so three important ones, the canonical, the grand canonical, micro canonical.
363000	382000	Most books deal with the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles but our arguments here belong to the micro canonical treatment of statistical statistical mechanics.
383000	403000	And you can find the data relating more important data or most important data related to the big bang in this reference at the end of the page from 2014.
403000	406000	Okay.
406000	431000	So let's start now with the most important relation of this paper which is the number of cells for the cell multiplicity for an n particle mono atomic ideal gas with energy e and volume V in face space.
431000	448000	The number is equation one, the number of cells is a function of the volume, the energy and the number of fermions and some very well known constants.
448000	458000	As I told you, you probably won't find this equation and ordinary textbook like one.
458000	468000	The whole textbook, which is devoted only to the micro canonical ensemble is given here from 2014.
468000	484000	And the authors is called lemons as student guide to end from different garbage university press. In this book you find all the whole of a statistical, the whole of elementary statistical mechanics.
484000	506000	So this is our question one is our fundamental equation, which I repeat again as a question to
507000	527000	we deal with the number of particles the volume and the energy because those are the thermal variables of the micro canonical ensemble so we are forced to use the man and no other ones for example not the temperature.
527000	541000	The temperature belongs to the canonical ensemble, for example, but not to the micro canonical.
541000	547000	Okay, again, equation three is the same equation, the number of cells.
547000	550000	For and fermions.
550000	565000	And now we give the volume, the standard form in terms of a field of a given radius and this radius will be important for our big bank considerations.
565000	572000	This is the radius we need to accommodate and firm.
572000	578000	Now, in a statistical mechanics.
578000	599000	Since the multiplicity allows us to express the entropy remember that the Boltzmann entropy is equal to the Boltzmann constant times the multiplicity omega.
600000	623000	To accommodate in n small cells, capital N fermions, you have the multiplicity of equation four, which is simple combinatorial expression that does not deserve much consideration.
623000	644000	So here we are dealing with very large numbers of course so we can use stealing principle or stealing formula or stealing site and approximate the gamma function according to equation five.
644000	663000	And then of the express the multiplicity that we need isn't the essential quantity in in a micro canonical description of anything, the main statistical mechanics quantity is the multiplicity.
663000	676000	Equation six as you see is an awful very awful expression, because has it has our number of cells.
676000	682000	Small n in the non exponential we have it in a logarithm.
682000	685000	It's an awful expression.
685000	704000	So to simplify this awful expression six, we change the scale of the, of the variable are the radius in the, in terms of a new variable is that it's a lot of our variables.
704000	712000	So they will allow us for a more.
712000	733000	For the multiplicity omega which is our equation eight, which follows below, in which now you see clearly that at least we see, we can present where the distance indicator is, is no longer the radius are insist it is the variable.
734000	748000	It's small. Now we see it in appearing in exponentials and logarithms, but at least it is there.
748000	751000	Okay.
751000	766000	Of course the multiplicity is a number which is larger than one which entails that it's lowering is larger than zero.
766000	777000	Now we can take the logarithm of omega in equation eight to simplify things.
777000	798000	And go to equation 10, which is the expression office blogging is still an awful equation but at least one gets an idea of what we are dealing with.
798000	805000	And now comes our central point.
805000	824000	The universe began or shortly after it began, it consisted of radiation and a gluon word plasma.
825000	837000	Short time after the singularity variance begin begin to emerge.
837000	854000	And these variants that emerge shortly after the big bang out to work glue and plasma are the protagonists of our tale of our story here.
854000	860000	And we happen in equation 10 in an awful expression.
860000	867000	But we will have this discussion.
867000	887000	Well, variance just emerged. There were no variants. And suddenly, variance start emerging at the very beginning there will be just once later the term intent on the multiplicity omega will be equal to one.
887000	900000	So, which is the solution for the variable in the radius indicator is to get that logarithm of omega is equal to one.
900000	913000	That that is the essential point of the dog the whole talk revolves around the moment at which the first variants emerge.
913000	923000	Form a slight determinant. There is no other way. And the multiplicity must be one because there is just one slight determinant.
923000	942000	And what is the radius indicator is that gets the logarithm of omega equal to unit, which is that special value of s. So we have here I an equation equal to zero.
942000	947000	This equation or 11.
947000	954000	And the question 11 has just two solutions.
954000	963000	The radius indicator is can be zero, or the radius indicator is can be one.
963000	971000	That solves the equation for getting multiplicity unity.
971000	974000	But it cannot be zero.
974000	985000	Because then the multiplicity omega would be negative, which is absurd.
985000	999000	So the only possible solution to equation 11 is that the indicator of the radius indicator is the equal to one.
1000000	1017000	And so suddenly, our first slight determinant within variance has a radius, which is not necessarily small.
1017000	1035000	And the face transition is not just zero point something is one. There is a jump from s equals zero to s equal one instantaneously at as soon as any variance emerge.
1035000	1059000	So let's go to a question seven remembers that is equal one implies a sign that the value for the radius of our in variance.
1059000	1063000	And here we say okay.
1063000	1068000	This jump in radius.
1068000	1076000	Needed to accommodate the first and variance that emerges from the quarter one plasma.
1076000	1082000	This jump of radius from zero to one constitutes inflation.
1082000	1105000	Okay, so we are here and making the report hypothesis that the mechanism behind cosmic inflation is just a simple quantum statistical mechanics argument regarding multiplicity.
1105000	1115000	And we have numbers because if it is equal to one.
1115000	1125000	We can then, for example, try to estimate how many fermions, how many variants emerge at the beginning.
1125000	1129000	This is the
1130000	1145000	Of course, we need to know what is at the end of the inflationary period but that is a known number, the, the, the radius of the universe.
1145000	1166000	The end of the inflationary period is 17 centimeters. So if we take our equal zero equal 17 centimeters we get a number of variants emerging
1166000	1171000	from
1171000	1180000	the big bang from from the quarter blue and plasma excuse me, which is a large number.
1180000	1191000	They all appear at the very beginning, and they are of the order of 10 to the 48.
1191000	1195000	When variance emerge, it doesn't.
1195000	1210000	They emerge as a whole bunch of or variance 10 to the 48, but you suddenly emerge out of the work blue and plasma.
1210000	1220000	And they occupy a reasonable large radius of 17 centimeters.
1220000	1241000	Note, however, that this number which is big 10 to the 48 is a small compared to the number of variants that we have today at the universe today at the universe we have of the order of 10 to the 79
1241000	1256000	variant so 10 to the 48 is just a very, very, very tiny small fraction of the number of variants that we have today.
1256000	1269000	And now comes a very strong point we believe a strong point for us for for our argument is not for us but for our.
1269000	1271000	Okay.
1271000	1279000	We use the celebrated equation for entropy.
1279000	1297000	Invented by boatsman that we find at the histone by the cemetery of Vienna, that the entropy is the ballman constant times the logarithm of the multiplicity omega.
1297000	1313000	And we know that the temperature obeys the equation one over temperature is equal to the derivative of the entropy with respect to the energy.
1313000	1317000	Of course taken at the end is equal one.
1317000	1324000	It's a simple equation 14 is what we have.
1324000	1346000	And if you put the corresponding value, the corresponding numbers that we find that the temperature at the end of the inflationary period is a temperature of the order of 10 to 18 Kelvin degrees.
1346000	1353000	And agrees with what people know about the inflationary period.
1353000	1360000	They know a lot of things which are in a reference that I put at the very beginning of this talk.
1360000	1374000	And one of the things that you will find is this kind of number that the temperate the inflation ended at the temperature of 10 to the 18 Kelvin degrees.
1374000	1387000	And we obtain this value out of the micro canonical ensemble.
1387000	1392000	So, I reached here the conclusions.
1392000	1409000	So what we have done here is just a very, very envelope calculation using a simple micro canonical and statistical argument.
1409000	1426000	And that shows that because of poly principle and fermions in our case and variants need a finite volume to exist.
1427000	1434000	When they are all out of the world blue and plasma.
1434000	1443000	They needed a volume of about the point 17 centimeters.
1443000	1456000	And the micro canonical considerations tell you immediately that the temperature has to be
1456000	1474000	of the order of 10 to the 18 degrees, which is what is needed to describe inflation.
1474000	1479000	To end this short talk.
1479000	1484000	What I have tried to show is that
1484000	1497000	based on the poly principle that without any doubt is an important piece of the foundation of quantum mechanics is
1497000	1501000	half of quantum mechanics is the poly principle.
1501000	1508000	That is starting with the poly principle and with the micro canonical ensemble of gifts.
1508000	1524000	You can immediately do a very simple calculation that gives you a number that agrees with what people that work on the singularity on the big bang on inflation.
1525000	1539000	That the temperature at the end of inflation is of the order of 10 to the 18 Kelvin degrees.
1539000	1564000	What we see and this is then that the extremely simple micro canonical statistical argument can say is able to predict something about the universe of large from a very small piece of a statistical mechanics, we can say something about the whole universe at its beginning.
1564000	1570000	Thank you very much.
1570000	1575000	Okay, thank you for your talk.
1575000	1586000	Now we have some minutes for questions or comments.
1586000	1596000	Thanks, Angel for this interesting talk.
1596000	1613000	The Pauli exclusion principle is puzzling for me because any other quantum characteristic like entanglement or coherence in general will be destroyed by
1614000	1622000	high temperatures that occur in cosmological events, but it seems that the Pauli
1622000	1630000	destroyed I mean the coherence the coherence will destroy any any quantum quantum
1630000	1649000	property but but it seems to me that the Pauli exclusion principle is still valid even even in in a in a very heated but surrounding the quantum system so do you have a word on that or a clue to understand better what's going on there.
1649000	1659000	Well, I have done it in other context I have done calculations, the statistical mechanical relations.
1659000	1663000	For example, with nuclear matter.
1663000	1675000	You know when you have heavy ion collisions, which are done every day today, the temperature get very high but the Pauli session principle works fine.
1675000	1698000	I mean, it's, that's why I was emphasizing that it is a very basic piece of the foundations of a statistical mechanics, although it is you are right, it is not clear why other quantum mechanical features seem to vanish.
1698000	1717000	If you go to high temperatures because you go to the classical limit in the at high temperatures, but it seems that not the Pauli principle, even with the high temperatures that people get and in accelerators today in heavy ion collisions the Pauli principle is respected
1717000	1720000	is no way of violating.
1720000	1735000	So it's something very strong that you are right from the philosophical point of view or epistemological point of view is not clear why, why it holds always.
1735000	1746000	It's really, really puzzling I think it's a, it's a very an open problem and open problem I haven't found any explanation of that.
1747000	1751000	From epistemology there is a big question.
1751000	1755000	Yeah, because there is no classical limit.
1755000	1763000	Yeah, if the classical limit would affect the Pauli principle, all matter will collapse, right?
1763000	1773000	Exactly, so thanks to the Pauli principle we exist and we are in this beautiful meeting.
1773000	1776000	Thanks, thank you.
1776000	1782000	Well, we are in time, so thanks.
1782000	1791000	If we have some minutes, if there is another question.
1792000	1794000	No.
1794000	1801000	No, yes, we thanks to Angela for the talk and the people who participate with questions.
