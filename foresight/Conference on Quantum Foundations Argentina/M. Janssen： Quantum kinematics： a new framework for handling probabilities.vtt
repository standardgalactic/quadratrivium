00:00.000 --> 00:09.440
Okay. Okay, welcome to the second part of the conference of this day. The first talk of this

00:09.440 --> 00:17.200
session is in charge of Michael Jensen from the University of Minnesota. The title of the talk is

00:17.760 --> 00:24.880
quantum kinematics. A new framework for handling probabilities. Go on, Michael.

00:25.600 --> 00:33.360
Okay. Thank you very much for the invitation. Everybody can see my screen. I hope you had

00:33.360 --> 00:40.000
a chance to read my abstract. So what I'll be doing for the most part is to talk about the

00:40.000 --> 00:47.920
correlations you can get with the proverbial Alice and Bob performing measurements on two spin half

00:47.920 --> 00:53.280
particles entangled in the singlet state. And I'll represent the class of correlations that you can

00:53.280 --> 00:58.800
get in that kind of, like I should say, in a setup that was suggested by David Merman,

00:58.800 --> 01:04.160
where Alice and Bob both choose from the same three observables that they're going to measure.

01:04.160 --> 01:08.000
And I'm going to be looking at the kind of correlations that are allowed in that setup,

01:08.000 --> 01:12.880
if you just restrict it to like anything that's non-signaling, anything that can be

01:12.880 --> 01:17.520
done quantum mechanically, and anything that can be done like with local hidden variable theories.

01:17.520 --> 01:23.760
And I'll show you that there is a nice three-dimensional graphical representation of that.

01:24.480 --> 01:31.680
So the work is based on a book that I wrote with Michael Janus and Michael Faro.

01:32.400 --> 01:40.000
So here is the three of us, like in Minneapolis a few years ago. And since the names of the three of

01:40.000 --> 01:45.120
us are sort of variations on Michael, like this has become known in certain circles already as

01:45.120 --> 01:53.120
the three mics manifesto. The book will come out in January. It's in the series Boston Studies in

01:53.120 --> 01:58.480
the Philosophy and History of Science. And its official title is Understanding Quantum Raffles.

01:59.680 --> 02:07.200
Now the book was inspired, and this is the banana that you'll be seeing as my background image

02:07.200 --> 02:13.280
throughout the talk, by this book by Jeff Boop, Banana World, Quantum Mechanics for Primates.

02:13.840 --> 02:20.080
And here you see a picture of me and Jeff at a conference in 2019, like in Santiago,

02:20.800 --> 02:27.360
like following actually right this conference in Cordoba in 2019, where I also gave the talk and

02:27.360 --> 02:32.960
had a great time. So I should also like put in a plug for like the sequel to Banana World,

02:33.680 --> 02:39.600
which is one of my favorite books. It's a serious comic on entanglement by Jeff and his daughter

02:39.600 --> 02:47.760
Tanya, a graphic artist called like Totally, Totally Random. So here's the set up I want to

02:47.760 --> 02:54.320
talk about. And so instead of talking about spin half particles, I'm going to be talking about

02:54.320 --> 03:01.200
like entangled bananas, like I said, in honor of Jeff's book. And so what we have, we start out

03:01.200 --> 03:07.440
with like a pair of entangled bananas, right? So they are described by the usual, you know,

03:07.440 --> 03:14.480
singlet state. And then like Alice and Bob, you know, the side like on one of three ways to

03:14.480 --> 03:19.760
peel the banana. And so this is basically just window dressing for like, you know, they have,

03:19.760 --> 03:25.520
they have like a Dubois magnet with which they measure spin in a certain direction. And now

03:25.520 --> 03:30.240
they're going to hold their banana in a particular direction, you know, while peeling it. And then

03:30.240 --> 03:36.160
they take a bite out of the banana and determine whether the banana tastes yasta, tastes yummy,

03:36.240 --> 03:43.520
or nasty, right? So and the results are we're going to, we're going to put like in a correlation

03:43.520 --> 03:49.280
array, which is really the workhorse of Jeff's book, Banana World. And so here you see like,

03:49.280 --> 03:54.080
you know, Alice can measure A, B and C, Bob can measure A, B and C, they can only find,

03:54.080 --> 04:00.320
you know, plus or minus corresponding to yummy and nasty. And what you see is that if they happen,

04:00.320 --> 04:06.000
all the runs in which they happen to peel the same way, they find like a perfect impact correlation,

04:06.000 --> 04:14.400
and in all the runs in which they peel different ways, they find like an imperfect, like positive

04:14.400 --> 04:20.960
correlation, right? So look at A, B. So there is like, you know, like a three fourth chance of them

04:20.960 --> 04:27.520
finding the same 75% chance of finding the same, and only a 25% chance of them finding opposite.

04:28.160 --> 04:33.360
And the question is like, you know, like, what's how to, how to account for this? Now, so this is

04:33.440 --> 04:39.600
like what you get in this Merman setup, if the angles between like the peeling directions are

04:39.600 --> 04:46.960
like 120 degrees. Now, you can consider like a more general correlation array of this sort.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.440
And we're going to consider like, you know, any array that would like this, that would be

04:53.440 --> 04:59.520
non signaling, right? And in order to guarantee non signaling, if you have these anti correlations,

04:59.600 --> 05:06.480
like on the diagonal, it has to be the case that you get uniform marginals. And you do that by

05:07.680 --> 05:14.960
making sure that in all the off diagonal cells, the sum of both the two rows and the two columns

05:14.960 --> 05:20.640
is equal to a half, right? And so since the probabilities, of course, also have to be like

05:20.640 --> 05:28.560
numbers between zero and one, you get that you can parameterize this by these chi's that I have here,

05:28.560 --> 05:35.280
and these chi's can run for all the way from minus one to plus one, right? And so I can characterize

05:35.280 --> 05:44.400
this correlation array by having three of these parameters for three of these cells, right? This

05:44.400 --> 05:50.400
thing is also going to be symmetric. It doesn't matter if you switch like A and B. So that's the

05:50.400 --> 05:57.200
story here. And you see that in the special case that is considered by Merman, that these chi values

05:57.200 --> 06:02.720
are equal to minus a half, right? So stick that in here. If you put in like minus a half, like this

06:02.720 --> 06:07.360
would be, you know, three halves. So this would be three eighths, right? And this would be, you know,

06:07.360 --> 06:12.640
like, you know, one eighth, right? So you recover that, you recover that Merman's correlation array.

06:12.640 --> 06:18.800
But again, like, you know, you, you, this is a more general form of it. Now, what we're going to try

06:18.880 --> 06:26.720
and do is to see like how, like what subclass of those correlations we can simulate, like with a

06:26.720 --> 06:33.120
raffle, right? And the raffle is our toy model for a local hidden variable theme. And so we have,

06:33.120 --> 06:37.760
we imagine that you have a basket with a bunch of tickets in it, and the tickets like half the

06:37.760 --> 06:43.680
outcomes for like all possible measurements that Alice and Bob can do. Now look at the first ticket,

06:43.680 --> 06:49.280
like, you know, we know that if they, if they measure the same way that they find opposite

06:49.280 --> 06:54.800
results, right? So like, you know, the results on two halves of the tickets have better be up,

06:54.800 --> 06:59.360
has better be opposite. The way it works is that you take a ticket, you rip the ticket in half,

06:59.360 --> 07:05.440
and then you randomly decide like which one goes to Alice and which one goes to Bob, right? So a

07:05.440 --> 07:09.600
ticket where you just switch the left and the right side does not give you a, this does not give

07:09.600 --> 07:16.320
you a new ticket. So with that said, there is like four different tickets, right? So it doesn't

07:16.320 --> 07:20.560
have to be the case that all the pluses are on one side, you could have a case where two of the

07:20.560 --> 07:25.520
pluses are on one side. And like, you know, with one minus, and again, there is three ways of doing

07:25.520 --> 07:30.800
this, right? So you have the minus here is for C here, the minus is for B, and here the minus is

07:30.800 --> 07:35.120
for A, right? And again, keep in mind that it doesn't matter which side of the ticket you're

07:35.120 --> 07:42.720
looking at. Now, we can easily see like if you had like single ticket raffles, just like a basket

07:42.720 --> 07:49.600
with one type, what these sky parameters would be, you know, for your correlation array. Because you

07:49.600 --> 07:55.440
can see that if you have this ticket, no matter whether you take like AA, AB or AC, you always

07:55.440 --> 08:01.440
have like a perfect anti-correlation. And that means that these sky values have to be like plus

08:01.520 --> 08:08.560
one. Like maybe I should go just like back here, right? So the moment that chi is plus one, right,

08:08.560 --> 08:13.600
then you see you have an anti-correlation, the moment that chi is minus one, you have like a

08:13.600 --> 08:19.520
perfect correlation. So okay, so that's easy. Now look at this ticket, there's a little more

08:19.520 --> 08:26.320
complicated. So for AB, you see that there's still a perfect anti-correlation. But if you now look at

08:26.320 --> 08:33.200
AC or at BC, you see that there's a correlation. So you have minus one. And the same is true for

08:33.200 --> 08:39.920
C and D, right? It's just that a different parameter will get like the plus and the other two parameters

08:39.920 --> 08:47.520
will be minus. And here then you immediately have like a bell inequality of the type of the

08:47.520 --> 08:55.120
Klauser-Hornschirmann Holtz variety. And you can see that, you know, like the sum of these three

08:55.120 --> 09:02.000
parameters is three, four ticket A, and it's going to be minus one for all other tickets. So if you

09:02.000 --> 09:08.560
take like an arbitrary mix of tickets, right, you would always get like a value somewhere between

09:08.560 --> 09:16.160
minus one and three. So and you see that Merman's example where chi, where these three chi's are

09:16.160 --> 09:22.320
minus a half. So that would be, if your sum would be minus three halves, violates this inequality.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.200
Now, the nice thing about this is that you can come up with a very nice geometrical representation

09:29.760 --> 09:37.120
of the situation. And that is essentially due to Jeff's long-time collaborator,

09:38.080 --> 09:45.760
now deceased, unfortunately, Idemar Petovsky. And so first of all, we start out with like, you know,

09:45.760 --> 09:51.600
like representing these chi values, they can run from minus one to one in like what is called

09:51.600 --> 09:56.080
like a non-signaling cube. Remember, like, you know, this was like the general form of a correlation

09:56.080 --> 10:02.240
array that is non-signaling. And you see that these tickets, like they're represented now by

10:02.240 --> 10:09.040
vertices of that non-signaling cube, right? So it's these four points, right, A, B, C, and D.

10:09.920 --> 10:18.000
And a mixed raffle would be represented on like points that are like somewhere in between, right?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.640
And once you have, so imagine, like, you know, you have your basket with tickets.

10:22.640 --> 10:27.920
So if you take this and this and you put a certain mix, you can end up somewhere over here,

10:27.920 --> 10:32.160
but then you take a mix of like, you know, D and C, you get somewhere over here,

10:32.160 --> 10:35.600
but you can also like, you know, now mix those, right? So you get all of that,

10:35.600 --> 10:42.240
and you can also like mix and match, mix and get like on the inside of this thing.

10:42.240 --> 10:49.360
So this is like what is known as the classical tetrahedron. And this is like a very nice way of

10:50.480 --> 10:56.160
geometrically representing, you know, what the local hidden variables here we can do.

10:56.720 --> 11:02.880
The bell in the quality only corresponds to like one facet of this tetrahedron.

11:02.880 --> 11:09.600
It just says that you can't be behind that plane like B, C, D, but you see that there are three

11:09.600 --> 11:15.840
other forbidden regions that you would also have to spell out if you want to define fully,

11:15.840 --> 11:23.680
you know, what is and what is not allowed. All right. So now in what is allowed by quantum

11:23.680 --> 11:30.800
mechanics, right? And so in quantum mechanics, the the result that is predicted by quantum

11:31.520 --> 11:38.400
is that these kais are just given by the cosine of the the peeling angle, right? In a way, this is

11:38.400 --> 11:42.720
like very satisfying, right? So classically, you see that these kais with these tickets,

11:42.720 --> 11:47.360
they're always going to be plus one or minus one, but wouldn't it be nice to have like a theory

11:47.360 --> 11:53.120
that just allows like a like a continuity of values between minus one and plus one? Quantum

11:53.120 --> 11:59.120
mechanics gives you just that, right? And so it's the cosine of the of the angle and that cosine,

11:59.120 --> 12:04.560
of course, is the inner product of like unit vectors in these different peeling directions.

12:06.160 --> 12:13.760
All right. So if you think about this correlation array, you see that the entire correlation array

12:13.760 --> 12:19.680
can be like characterized by by these parameters, right? These sky parameters. And we can also

12:19.680 --> 12:31.440
introduce them for the for the for the diagonal cells, where they're just one. Okay. So and so we'll

12:31.440 --> 12:37.200
I'll I'll define this more carefully later on. But these guys are like, you know, what what can be

12:37.200 --> 12:42.560
called like anti correlation coefficients. As for now, it's just hinges on three values, right? If

12:42.560 --> 12:47.680
chi is one, we saw you have a perfect anti correlation. If it's minus one, you have a perfect

12:47.760 --> 12:52.480
correlation, right? So it makes sense that the anti correlation coefficient is then minus one.

12:52.480 --> 12:59.600
If chi is zero, you have no correlation at all. Now look at introduce now like a matrix, an anti

12:59.600 --> 13:08.880
correlation matrix of just these chi values. And you can write that again, like in in terms of these

13:08.880 --> 13:16.400
inner products of these unit vectors. Now, this is a grand matrix, right? And it's a well known

13:16.400 --> 13:21.360
property of the of the grand matrix. It doesn't take too much to verify this. But in the interest

13:21.360 --> 13:27.920
of time, I'll skip that. We know that the determinant of that of that matrix is going to be it's going

13:27.920 --> 13:33.440
to have to be greater or equal than zero. And if you just calculate the determinant of this here,

13:33.440 --> 13:41.200
you now get this condition. Okay. So quantum mechanics like imposes the condition that that,

13:41.280 --> 13:47.760
you know, that this inequality has to be satisfied. So put differently, right? So quantum

13:47.760 --> 13:53.760
mechanics, once you have the idea that these chi values are the cosine of the of the peeling angles,

13:53.760 --> 14:00.480
so you can you can specify like the correlation array by just giving me three angles. But basic

14:00.480 --> 14:05.520
geometry tells me that once I pick two of these three angles, it puts constraints on the third.

14:05.520 --> 14:12.400
And this one, this is the constraint that it that it imposes. And if you now like plot this,

14:12.400 --> 14:18.000
you see that what this picks out is an elliptope, or, you know, what has been called sort of a

14:18.000 --> 14:23.760
fat tetrahedron, you puff it up a bit, the lines here are contained in it. But like, you know,

14:23.760 --> 14:29.360
in the middle, like it's it's blown up a bit. And we call this like the elliptope inequality.

14:29.360 --> 14:33.920
And this then is sort of the quantum analog of the of, you know, what the

14:35.200 --> 14:40.000
the CHSH inequality in the case of the Merman setup, right? And remember, for the full

14:40.000 --> 14:44.880
specification, we don't need just one, but we need four of those inequalities here,

14:44.880 --> 14:53.040
we only need one nonlinear inequality. And this inequality is satisfied by Merman's example,

14:53.040 --> 14:57.040
right? I mean, if you just look at it, you see that this if you put in a half,

14:57.840 --> 15:02.000
you get like exactly that this is going to be equal to zero.

15:04.880 --> 15:12.000
So this is actually a neat result, I think, because it gives a concrete example of like

15:12.000 --> 15:19.680
a cartoon that you often see about how the convex set for, you know, non signaling quantum

15:19.680 --> 15:25.840
and local hidden variable theories are related. Right. So so here is the here's a cross section

15:25.840 --> 15:32.000
of our drawing, right, with the non signaling cube, the elliptope and the tetrahedron, right?

15:32.720 --> 15:38.560
And now compare that to like the cartoon that is in Banana World, right, where you see like

15:39.280 --> 15:45.760
the non signaling cube with like, you know, like the maximal variation, like a Perpeco-Rohlich box,

15:45.760 --> 15:50.560
right, was a super quantum correlation that still is non signaling and doesn't violate special

15:50.560 --> 15:55.760
relativity. Then you have the quantum convex set. And then in the middle, you have the local

15:55.760 --> 16:01.920
polytope. And the beauty is, is that in this particular example of the of the Merman setup,

16:02.800 --> 16:09.200
you you reproduce like now exactly, you know, what you just have as a cartoon in in general.

16:13.600 --> 16:20.160
And you can play the same game for bananas now entangled bananas of higher spin. And so in our

16:20.160 --> 16:25.840
book, we do this right. So here's what the correlation array looks like. Just one cell for a spin one

16:25.840 --> 16:31.440
banana. The anti correlation coefficient, it turns out, you know, which is defined like this.

16:32.160 --> 16:38.000
I'll get to that in a moment, like stays the same is still the cosine. If you go for two,

16:38.000 --> 16:45.840
three halves still the same cosines. So all these correlations are all like constrained by the exact

16:45.840 --> 16:53.680
same elliptope inequality. That's not the case if you now try to simulate them with these raffles.

16:54.240 --> 16:59.760
So we saw that, you know, like if you do this for spin half, you get like the tetrahedron, right,

16:59.760 --> 17:05.920
so you get something with like four facets like this. If you now go up to higher spin, you see

17:05.920 --> 17:10.720
that you get a little more structure on these on these on these facets. So this is what it looks

17:10.720 --> 17:16.400
like for spin one and notice that this point here is going to touch the the the elliptope

17:18.080 --> 17:23.280
for for spin three halves, it's not going to touch the elliptope again. But for all integer spin,

17:23.280 --> 17:27.120
it will, right, you see this gets more and more faceted, more and more

17:28.960 --> 17:35.120
vertices. And like you can, it's very suggestive that if you go up to higher and higher spin,

17:35.120 --> 17:40.800
it gets more and more close to the elliptope, but never quite gets there, right.

17:42.320 --> 17:50.480
Now, the so so far it may seem that this elliptope somehow captures like something special about

17:50.480 --> 17:55.280
quantum mechanics, in particular, like we used, you know, sort of as hidden like in what I showed

17:55.280 --> 18:00.960
you, what we use like, you know, the Bourne rule, the Hilbert space formalism. But in fact, this

18:00.960 --> 18:07.040
inequality is not new to quantum mechanics at all. It has been known to statisticians since the 1890s,

18:07.040 --> 18:12.480
and it's basically a general constraint on the correlations between any three random variables,

18:12.480 --> 18:16.160
right, which also like, you know, makes it understandable that even if you go to higher

18:16.160 --> 18:20.400
spin particles in quantum mechanics, you'll never get out of the get out of the elliptope.

18:20.960 --> 18:26.720
So this work is due to Carl Pearson, and mostly to Utney Yule. So Pearson, of course, these days

18:26.720 --> 18:31.520
is mostly remembers for his dubious role in the eugenics movement, but he's also like, you know,

18:31.520 --> 18:37.280
like a very important character in statistics. So let me run to this quickly, right. So now we're

18:37.280 --> 18:42.320
talking about some arbitrary random variables with sets of possible outcomes that I'm going to

18:42.320 --> 18:47.520
keep discreet. And in fact, I'm only interested in a case where you have you have a random variable

18:47.520 --> 18:55.440
with only two outcomes, like, you know, yummy and nasty. And so I'm going to restrict my attention to

18:56.000 --> 19:02.560
what we call balanced random variables. And that just means that if X i X of i is a possible value,

19:02.560 --> 19:09.520
minus X i is two, and that the probability of X i and the probability of minus X i is the same.

19:10.400 --> 19:16.240
And that simplifies matters, because that means that in that case, the expectation value is going

19:16.240 --> 19:22.880
to be zero. And that simplifies like some other variables that some other quantities that we're

19:22.880 --> 19:28.000
interested in. So we're looking at the variance, right? So the expectation value of X minus the

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
expected value of X squared. If the expected value of X is zero, then the variation of X is just the

19:34.000 --> 19:40.080
expectation value of X squared. The standard deviation is the square root of that. And then

19:40.080 --> 19:45.520
the covariance, again, like, you know, in general would be like the expectation value of X minus

19:45.520 --> 19:50.880
the expectation value of X times Y minus the expectation value of Y, if these two expectation

19:50.880 --> 19:58.080
values are zero, then that is just going to be equal to the expectation value of X times Y.

19:59.680 --> 20:04.560
And I now introduce like what is called the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is just the

20:04.560 --> 20:13.200
covariance of the Pearson correlation coefficients of X and Y is the covariance of X and Y divided

20:13.200 --> 20:20.080
by the corresponding standard deviation, sigma X and sigma Y. And so if X and Y are balanced,

20:20.160 --> 20:26.880
this is just the expectation value of X and Y divided by these standard deviations.

20:26.880 --> 20:33.520
And you can immediately see two properties like, you know, the Pearson correlation coefficient

20:33.520 --> 20:39.040
of a variable with itself is just one. And it doesn't matter if you look at a correlation coefficient

20:39.040 --> 20:50.320
X, Y or Y, X. And we'll now I'll now prove for you that such such any triplet of such variables

20:50.320 --> 20:54.960
is going to have to satisfy this elliptope inequality. And this was shown by Yule in the

20:54.960 --> 21:00.240
late 1890s. So here's where here's one way to do it, like, you know, consider, you know, for any

21:00.240 --> 21:07.840
triplet v1 v2 v3, like this quantity over here. So I'm looking at the expectation value of some

21:07.840 --> 21:12.640
expression squared. So I know this is going to be greater or equal to zero. And now I'm going to

21:12.640 --> 21:18.960
work this out. Okay, so I take like, you know, like this term times the rest that gives me this

21:18.960 --> 21:26.080
here, right. And so notes that I now get like, you know, v1. And then I have like, x times x,

21:26.080 --> 21:32.240
right, expectation value x squared divided by sigma x squared. And then we have the x times the y,

21:32.240 --> 21:39.760
the x times z. And then you have similar terms for like, if you now do the v2 y over sigma y and v3

21:39.760 --> 21:45.840
z over sigma c. And you see that in here, like you have like all these Pearson correlation

21:45.840 --> 21:51.120
coefficients, it just looks like that. Right. And I can write this like a little more

21:51.680 --> 21:58.640
concisely and compactly as justice matrix with these Pearson correlation coefficients

21:58.720 --> 22:07.520
sandwiched between like, you know, the column vector v1 v2 v3, and the row vector v1 v2 v3.

22:08.400 --> 22:15.840
And remember that this thing has to be greater or equal than zero for any, for any value of v1,

22:15.840 --> 22:21.760
v2, v3, which means that that matrix row is positive semi definite, which means that the

22:21.760 --> 22:28.080
determinant of row has to be greater or equal than zero. And it follows that, you know, that

22:28.080 --> 22:35.360
that's just the elliptope inequality. Right. So there we have it again. Okay. So now,

22:37.280 --> 22:44.000
look at the special case that x, y, and z are the taste of Alice's banana, right, in this

22:44.000 --> 22:50.640
experiment in the, in the Merman setup, right. So x is the, the taste of Alice's banana when she

22:50.640 --> 22:55.920
peels in the A direction, y is the taste of Alice's banana when she peels in the B direction and z

22:55.920 --> 23:02.320
is the taste when Alice's banana when she peels in the C direction. All right. So now the obvious

23:02.320 --> 23:09.040
problem is, is that as Papescu points out in the, in the preface or the forward of banana world,

23:09.760 --> 23:14.800
a banana can only be eaten once, right, once it's peeled, it's peeled, once it's tasted, it's

23:14.800 --> 23:22.080
tasted. But there's, we'll see there's ways around this, this, this problem. So first I note that

23:22.080 --> 23:26.880
these variables are balanced, right. So we have to now give them some numerical value rather than

23:26.880 --> 23:32.640
just yummy or nasty, but you know, inspired by spin, you know, like instead of having like a half

23:32.640 --> 23:39.360
h bar, we now have like a half, like a B bar, you know, which I call the banana split, which is just

23:39.360 --> 23:46.080
boops constant B divided by two pi. And we're going to pick units such that B bar is equal to one.

23:47.040 --> 23:52.240
And so then, you know, these, we see that these, that these variables are perfectly balanced,

23:52.240 --> 23:59.520
the expectation value is zero, the variance, right. So it's like, you know, half, half the time,

23:59.520 --> 24:06.240
like, you know, it's the product is, it's, it's, it's one half squared, the other half is like,

24:06.240 --> 24:11.040
you know, minus a half squared, and that adds up to one fourth, the standard deviation take the

24:11.040 --> 24:17.200
square root that is like a half. Now the covariance here, it's a little trickier.

24:18.320 --> 24:23.680
And what we're going to do. And like, you know, if you, if you're squeamish about this, like, we

24:23.680 --> 24:30.640
did find a way to avoid like this counterfactual reasoning. But I think it's perfectly innocuous.

24:30.640 --> 24:37.520
We're going to use my the opposite, if you want to find the covariance of the variables Alice,

24:38.400 --> 24:43.360
Alice's taste of banana when peeling a and the taste of Alice's banana when peeling B.

24:44.320 --> 24:54.720
So half Alice appeal a and then have her use minus what Bob finds when he peels B as a proxy

24:54.720 --> 24:58.640
for what she would have find had she peeled B instead.

25:01.120 --> 25:05.920
And so basically, like, you know, that so we use we calculate this thing here,

25:05.920 --> 25:13.840
and we can use our correlation array to figure this out. Right. So we have like, if the if the

25:13.840 --> 25:23.280
if the tastes are are the are the same, we get we get we get like one fourth. What is the probability

25:23.280 --> 25:27.920
of that happening? Well, you need to add these two things. Right. So that's a half one minus

25:28.560 --> 25:33.120
guy AB. And then, you know, like, if they're opposite, it's minus one fourth. And the probability

25:33.120 --> 25:37.920
of that happening is this, if you work this out, you see that this is one fourth times guy AB.

25:38.640 --> 25:42.400
And if you now like calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, you see that that is

25:42.400 --> 25:48.960
exactly equal to guy AB. Right. I already took an advance on that result calling this guy be like

25:48.960 --> 25:52.240
an anti correlation coefficient, right. And the anti is because of this minus.

25:54.480 --> 26:00.240
All right. So the elliptop inequality, you know, I can just now write for this for these particular

26:00.240 --> 26:03.920
variables, right. So in terms of these rows, now, in terms of these guys.

26:05.760 --> 26:11.280
And so this is just exactly the same. But there is a few problems, right. So the first problem

26:11.280 --> 26:18.800
we already dealt with, like, how do we determine the taste of these two of a Alice feeling a and

26:18.800 --> 26:25.600
Alice feeling B and one run? Well, you know, have or use Bob's result as a proxy for one of those.

26:25.600 --> 26:31.200
Right. Now, the second problem is like, you know, we can only do this for two tastes for two

26:31.200 --> 26:36.640
feelings in one run. Well, that's not a big problem either. Like, you can just have different ones.

26:36.640 --> 26:40.800
Right. So if you think about it, that's what we always do, you know, like you like, if you think

26:40.800 --> 26:46.640
about the early tests of the CHSH inequality, they weren't switching the settings like, you know,

26:46.640 --> 26:52.320
from run to run, you just take measurements for one pair of standing and then fill in another

26:52.320 --> 26:57.520
pair. That's all perfectly fine. So that we can do the third problem seems to be a lot nastier.

26:58.080 --> 27:04.640
And there the promise is that, you know, that we we derive this elliptop inequality from the

27:04.640 --> 27:11.440
condition starting that this the expectation value, this quantity is always greater equal than zero.

27:11.440 --> 27:19.040
Right. But the point is that we cannot determine the value of this in one in one run. And it would

27:19.040 --> 27:24.960
seem that if if all these three variables like can only take on values like plus or minus a half,

27:24.960 --> 27:29.680
that yes, it's going to be greater equal than zero. But that inequality is not tight because like,

27:29.680 --> 27:34.080
you know, like we could easily the smallest we could get this is to something like, you know,

27:34.080 --> 27:40.000
a half, like, you know, like a state plus and minus, minus here, and then we have a quarter.

27:40.960 --> 27:48.880
So this took us a while to to to figure out and the the the answer actually hinges on like,

27:49.760 --> 27:53.600
you know, like an interesting property of quantum mechanics, namely that in quantum mechanics,

27:53.600 --> 27:58.640
it's perfectly possible for a sum to have a definite value, even if the individual terms

27:58.640 --> 28:04.160
in that sum do not. Right. So the simplest example I can think of is like, you know, the Hamiltonian

28:04.240 --> 28:09.760
for harmonic oscillator, clearly P and Q cannot have like, you know, definite values at the same

28:09.760 --> 28:15.120
time, but you know, the Hamiltonian can. And so to look at this a little more clearly, right,

28:15.120 --> 28:20.320
so if you if you were looking essentially at sort of a sum of like her mission operators,

28:21.120 --> 28:27.600
linear combination, and that in and of itself should be like a good operator. And so if you

28:27.600 --> 28:32.880
introduce like, you know, now like in analogy with a spin vector, like a taste vector,

28:34.160 --> 28:41.040
you get, you can write like the taste in the A direction as like the inner products of like

28:41.040 --> 28:49.120
T with like the unit vector in the A direction, same for TB, same for TC. And then the inequality

28:49.120 --> 28:55.280
becomes this, and you see that we're in a product thing, but the the taste vector with this vector,

28:55.280 --> 29:03.360
and this will be zero whenever this combination is zero. Right. And so if you if there are if you

29:03.360 --> 29:08.000
pick the right peeling directions for starters that need to be in one plane, you can actually

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
like achieve that. So this this inequality is tight. And this result applies to so the general

29:14.000 --> 29:22.720
result of yield does applies to to this to this quantum example. All right. So what do I want

29:22.720 --> 29:28.880
to conclude from this? Okay. So the point is, is that this elliptope inequality that we derived

29:28.880 --> 29:34.080
first within quantum mechanics from the geometry of Hilbert space can also be derived without

29:34.080 --> 29:39.040
quantum mechanics as a general constraint on correlations between three random variables.

29:39.680 --> 29:46.560
And is this this distinction like actually we got from within from without from a song by Bob Dylan.

29:53.120 --> 30:14.960
So the message then this is the big message of the of the talk is that what this suggests

30:14.960 --> 30:19.920
is that the basic Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics is just a new framework for

30:19.920 --> 30:25.600
handling probabilities. Right. And so this take on quantum mechanics, which has been dubbed

30:25.600 --> 30:32.080
boobism is a pun on cubism by Robert Mischewitz belongs, I think, to a class of informational

30:32.080 --> 30:40.960
makeovers of the much maligned Copenhagen interpretation. And so in order to to make that

30:40.960 --> 30:46.160
clear, like I want to talk, I'll take five more minutes to make the point. And this is far more

30:46.240 --> 30:51.280
speculative and tentative than what I've said so far. I think it's best to sort of think in terms

30:51.280 --> 30:56.080
of like a genealogy of quantum interpretations. And so we got like two versions of quantum

30:56.080 --> 31:02.480
mechanics around 1925 26. First, we have matrix mechanics. And Heisenberg's big discovery was

31:02.480 --> 31:09.040
that these problems in spectroscopy that he was running into, just call for a new framework for

31:09.120 --> 31:16.400
dealing with with physics, just as like the problems that people had run into in electrodynamics

31:16.400 --> 31:20.800
around the turn of the century, called for a new framework of dealing with spatial temporal

31:21.360 --> 31:26.240
relations. Now, of course, a little bit later, like Schrodinger comes up with wave mechanics,

31:26.240 --> 31:30.880
and his big discovery compatible with Heisenberg was very different, like namely,

31:30.880 --> 31:35.920
here the idea is that something wavy is underlying the behavior that we're seeing. And the analogy

31:35.920 --> 31:42.160
here is with wave optics in the 19th century. And so they famously didn't care for each other,

31:42.880 --> 31:46.720
for each other's views, like, you know, like Heisenberg calling wave mechanics disgusting,

31:47.680 --> 31:52.320
and Schrodinger calling matrix mechanics repulsive. And but of course, like mathematical

31:52.320 --> 31:56.080
equivalence was rapidly proved in part by Schrodinger himself, but then by the rock,

31:56.080 --> 32:01.360
yard down for Neumann. And that kind of papers over like a very different way of thinking about

32:01.360 --> 32:06.720
the state, the status of the state vector in the Hilbert space. And I think roughly you can say

32:06.720 --> 32:10.640
that the descendants of wave mechanics, those are the ontic interpretations of quantum mechanics,

32:10.640 --> 32:17.360
think Everett, the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory, and the Girardi-Romini-Weber spontaneous

32:17.360 --> 32:22.240
collapse theory. And the descendants of matrix mechanics are the epistemic interpretations

32:22.240 --> 32:30.720
in where I would include Copenhagen, Cubism, and now like, you know, Bubism. And so just a quick way

32:30.800 --> 32:35.920
of sort of showing, you know, what I'm, what I'm after, like contrast Boop with Everett, right?

32:35.920 --> 32:40.240
So for Boop, like what the Hilbert space is doing you is doing for you, it's giving you the Born

32:40.240 --> 32:45.920
Rule, but it doesn't represent stuff, right? In order to represent stuff, you need like some specific

32:45.920 --> 32:52.720
quantum applications running on this new quantum operating system to use kind of the metaphor

32:52.720 --> 32:57.840
of Nielsen and Chang's book on quantum information. Now, for Everett, it's just the way,

32:57.920 --> 33:00.960
it's just the other way around. Hilbert space gives you stuff, you know,

33:00.960 --> 33:04.400
Sean Carroll, like says, like, you know, the world is made out of wave functions, right?

33:05.920 --> 33:11.040
So, but it doesn't give you the Born Rule now, right? I mean, so for that they appeal to decision

33:11.040 --> 33:16.480
theory for agents and a multiverse, okay? Now, so this is Oxford Everettians, there's also another

33:16.480 --> 33:21.840
class of Everettians, Berlin Everettians like Christoph Lainer, who really have the courage

33:21.840 --> 33:27.760
of their convictions, who use like Hilbert space both to represent stuff and to get the Born Rule

33:27.840 --> 33:31.520
and of course, it's a good Everettian, right? You take advantage of the fact that in a multiverse,

33:31.520 --> 33:38.720
you really can have your cake and eat it too. So now, for more careful exegesis of all of this,

33:39.600 --> 33:44.160
you, you know, I'm going to refer you to our book, where especially like, you know,

33:44.160 --> 33:51.520
microfarro, like, lace this out, like much more patiently than I just did, and I'm going to leave

33:51.520 --> 33:57.280
you like with one more version of this, of this Dylan song.

34:22.160 --> 34:30.240
Now, right, I'm happy to take some questions if there's time.

34:31.600 --> 34:39.120
Yes, we have some minutes for comments or questions. If you want to make a comment or question, please

34:39.120 --> 34:56.560
indicate it in the chat. I have a short question. Do you think that, or my real question is,

34:56.560 --> 35:02.400
if you have some experience in the classroom with this type of

35:03.280 --> 35:12.320
topological approximation mechanics, do you think that it can help in education?

35:16.400 --> 35:20.160
I'm just making sure. Do you think the question is, like, do you think that this

35:20.160 --> 35:22.400
way of thinking about quantum mechanics can help education?

35:22.640 --> 35:36.320
No, this form to present some results with the topological forms can help in education

35:36.320 --> 35:40.000
of quantum mechanics in the in the courses in the universe.

35:41.120 --> 35:45.040
Yeah, no, I mean, like, I'm currently teaching a course on introducing, like,

35:45.040 --> 35:48.000
non physics majors to quantum mechanics, where I very much use this,

35:48.720 --> 35:52.640
use this approach that I showed you, right? And so, and like,

35:53.680 --> 35:58.560
yeah, and so, but it's, I mean, it gives you like a particular way of thinking about quantum

35:58.560 --> 36:04.160
mechanics, right? It really pushes this idea that quantum mechanics is like a, you know,

36:04.160 --> 36:09.440
the kinematics of quantum mechanics, right? The basic formalism is a new framework for handling

36:09.440 --> 36:13.600
probabilities, right? And that, you know, in order to do anything else, right, now you need to do

36:13.600 --> 36:20.160
dynamics, you need to like introduce like stuff, right? And what quantum mechanics is telling you

36:20.160 --> 36:26.560
that it had to, that it has to behave according to the rules of quantum, right? So, so that's,

36:26.560 --> 36:32.480
that's the view I'm pushing. Historically, what I find interesting is that if you now look at

36:32.480 --> 36:39.760
modern books on probability theory and statistics, is that Hilbert space methods are being used in

36:39.760 --> 36:45.600
these books. And somehow like, so as a historian, I'm very interested, like how it came to be,

36:45.600 --> 36:50.000
that there seems to be very little communication between people in physics using Hilbert space

36:50.000 --> 36:57.120
methods, and people in general statistics using like Hilbert space methods. Okay, thank you. And

36:57.120 --> 37:07.520
there is a question from Federico Hoelig. Yes, thanks, Michelle, for, for this wonderful talk.

37:07.600 --> 37:13.920
It's always great to hear you. I always get really excited. And I want to learn more about

37:13.920 --> 37:22.640
this approach. And my question is related to what is the stake or the take of your interpretation

37:22.640 --> 37:31.040
with regard to non-locality? Because if you interpret quantum mechanics as a new probability

37:31.040 --> 37:38.000
formalism, what can you say about the strong claims that the word is local versus the word

37:38.000 --> 37:45.760
is non-local? What will you say about that? Yeah, so, so the, that's a difficult question.

37:46.960 --> 37:53.680
So, so what I would say is that, you know, in the spirit of what I showed you is that,

37:53.680 --> 38:02.000
you know, like you would, you would have thought that special relativity like requires you to,

38:02.000 --> 38:07.440
you know, like tell some story where you can like screen off like any correlation by something,

38:07.440 --> 38:12.560
you know, that by a common cause. And it turns out that the constraints are not that tight,

38:12.560 --> 38:18.000
you can have like, you can have like a very much more liberal constraint and still be

38:18.000 --> 38:23.280
non-singling. In fact, you can go beyond quantum mechanics, and you can have like PR boxes. And

38:23.280 --> 38:28.000
so to, I would say you just have to get used to the fact that you should resist the temptation

38:28.000 --> 38:34.480
that when you have these like correlations that cannot be dealt with sort of the standard way

38:34.480 --> 38:38.720
screening them off by conditionalizing on common causes, that you think of these as just

38:38.720 --> 38:43.840
constrained produced by natures and not like, oh, Alice does one thing and then like, you know,

38:43.840 --> 38:50.160
like it travels like instantaneously to Bob or vice versa. And if you, if you, if you go for this

38:50.800 --> 38:55.520
if you go this epistemic route, that is easier, right? I mean, like, I think a lot of students

38:55.520 --> 39:02.000
in quantum mechanics who, you know, like, no matter how, how often you tell them that astrodinger,

39:02.000 --> 39:07.520
that astrodinger wave function is not a field on ordinary space, still have this picture like,

39:07.520 --> 39:12.800
well, then you do a measurement and the whole thing goes poof, instantaneously. And like now

39:12.800 --> 39:17.440
you're stretching your head like, you know, what is it that is traveling from like Alice to Bob

39:17.440 --> 39:23.280
that then like frustratingly you can never use to send a signal, right? And so I'm hoping that

39:23.280 --> 39:28.240
this approach will sort of prevent people like, you know, from going down that particular rabbit

39:28.240 --> 39:42.640
hole in the first place. Okay, thanks. Thanks. It's clear. Yeah. I tend to agree. Yes.
