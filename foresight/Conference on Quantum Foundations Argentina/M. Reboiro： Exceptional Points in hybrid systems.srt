1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
Perfecto.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,720
Welcome, everyone, to the third, to the fourth day

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,320
of the 10 Conference of Quantum Foundations.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,120
We are glad to start this morning's session with Professor

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,400
Marta Reboido from the Department of Physics

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,680
of the University of La Plata and the Institute of Physics

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,720
of La Plata-Ponisette.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,080
She will speak about exceptional points

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,600
from a hybrid physical system.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,880
Please, go on, Marta.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,120
OK, good morning to everybody.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,280
First of all, I want to thank the organizers

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,840
for letting us share our work in this nice and interesting

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,280
conference on Quantum Foundations.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,960
This work has been done in collaboration

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,160
with Romina RamÃ­rez and Diego Tielas

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,320
from the University of La Plata.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,000
The focus of my talk is the existence

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,600
of a sectional point in hybrid physical systems.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,520
I shall highlight some connections

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,680
to the time evolution of the given initial prepared state

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:19,400
and, in particular, its behavior at long intervals of time.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,520
Hybrid models are a system consisting

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,520
of two or more components intended

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,280
to harness the advantages and strengths of each of these

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,680
components.

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,000
As an example, we can think of the model proposed

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,280
10 years ago by Sue et al.

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,840
Consistent of a superconductive flux

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,800
COVID coupled to a system of MBs, a nitrogen vacancy

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:08,800
in diamon, this is interesting because the superconductive

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,200
flux COVID can be used to model the two-level systems

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,520
and to make COVID operations and due to the long time

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,000
coherence time of the MBs, the MBs can be used

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,360
as a memory of the system.

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,680
Here is the experimental device.

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,160
This is the diamon sample.

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,400
And here on the top is the superconductive circuit.

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,280
From the theoretical point of view,

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,960
this hybrid model can be represented

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,400
by Hamiltonian consisting of three terms, a COVID term,

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,440
a term associated with the nitrogen vacancy system

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,000
and interaction term.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,680
The superconductive flux COVID consists

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,800
of an aluminum superconductive loop

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,480
with three chasps on junctions and a magnetic field.

47
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,880
And when the magnetic field is applied through the loop,

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,400
the system can be modeled by a two-level Hamiltonian,

49
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,920
where E is the energy bias, delta is the tunneling splitting,

50
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,280
X, the operator S are related.

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,360
Here should be, et cetera, the operator S

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,400
is related to the half-poly matrices.

53
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,720
And through a suitable transformation,

54
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,520
it can be mapped to, it can be generalized.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,280
And the energies of the system are given in terms

56
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:05,360
of the energy bias and the gap tunnel split.

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,960
The nitrogen vacancy center is defect in the lattice,

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,080
in the diamon, in the lattice of the diamon,

59
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,600
where a carbon atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom,

60
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,000
and its neighbor is a vacancy.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,640
This system can be modeled by the ground state of the system,

62
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,320
is a triplet.

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,120
When there is no external magnetic field applied,

64
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,040
the two excited states of the template are degenerate

65
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,840
and separated from the ground state

66
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:50,040
an energy of 2.88 GHz.

67
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,440
This separation energy makes this system adequate to be

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,920
coupled to the superconductive class COVID.

69
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,280
The interaction time is usually taken

70
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:22,000
as the component set of the spin of the COVID

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,480
times the x component of the spin of the MVs.

72
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:35,360
We have modified the x component of the spins

73
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,120
to take into account the effect of other impurities

74
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,640
in the diamon.

75
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,760
The more relevant are neutral nitrogen vacancy centers

76
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:57,600
called P1 centers, which are responsible for the loss

77
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,920
of coherence of the MVs.

78
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,400
So we have introduced this term that is non-admission.

79
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,800
If the interaction is not present

80
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,360
and we take a system of two MVs, we

81
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:21,600
have the two levels of the COVIDs and three levels

82
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,480
for the quality coupling of the two MVs.

83
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,120
When the interaction term is turned on,

84
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,120
there is a splitting of the levels.

85
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,960
And due to the fact that this term is non-admission,

86
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,920
sign of the level can acquire a wheel.

87
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,400
That is, the eigenvalues of the system can be complex.

88
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,680
To understand the spectrum of the system,

89
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:57,720
we can see that the adjoined Hamiltonian

90
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,680
is the transpose of H. That means

91
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,120
that this both Hamiltonian and this spectral operators

92
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,840
and, in consequence, the eigenvalues are

93
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,040
other real or complex conflict pairs.

94
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:24,280
The basis can be leveled by the states of the COVIDs

95
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,120
and the collective states of the MVs.

96
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,920
If we let us first describe what happens

97
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,960
with the system of one superconductive blue cube,

98
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,680
COVID coupled to two MVs.

99
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,720
These are the typical constants of the sector

100
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,960
of the MVs and we shall assume that the tunneling

101
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,760
splitting of the superconductive blue cube

102
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,880
can be set at the value of 2D.

103
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,040
And this a dimensional coupling is

104
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,040
the strength of the interaction in terms of the coupling E.

105
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,320
If we plot the eigenvalues in terms

106
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,320
of this a dimensional coupling and in terms

107
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,640
of the asymmetric parameter, we realize that there is a sector

108
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,440
in the parameter model space where the eigenvalues

109
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,240
are complex configurations.

110
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,080
This limiting curve is the curve where

111
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,520
exceptional points occurs.

112
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,280
An essential point is a point in the parameter model

113
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,280
space where the eigenvalues are coalescent

114
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,680
and also the eigenfunctions.

115
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,760
That is, the matrix of the system is no longer

116
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,880
the diagonalizable.

117
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,000
This pattern that I have plot before for the case of delta

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:18,360
equal 2D, this small d equals 0, is this line up here.

119
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:25,240
And if we now vary the value of delta over d,

120
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,760
we found that there is a regular pattern

121
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,880
for exceptional points in the system.

122
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,560
To look at the time evolution of the system,

123
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,840
we shall use the formalities of the green function.

124
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,280
If we have the Hamiltonian, the green matter

125
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,480
is related to the Hamiltonian in this way.

126
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,680
And the time evolution of the system

127
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,320
can be expressed in terms of the Fourier transform

128
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,480
of the green matrix.

129
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,640
The transition matrix shall be defined in terms

130
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,520
of the Fourier transform in this way

131
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:12,400
and give us the information of the transition

132
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,280
between these states as a function of time.

133
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:27,960
Here I have fixed the value of g to 0.02 GHz.

134
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:36,240
And then this is the typical plot for an exceptional point

135
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,960
in this region.

136
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,560
The energy is real.

137
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,560
In this region and this region, the energy is complicated.

138
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,200
If we look at the transition probability,

139
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,040
that is the entries of the matrix that I have defined before,

140
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:01,120
for a long interval of time, in terms of alpha,

141
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,080
we see that the transition probabilities of sun

142
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:11,920
states tend to value different from 0

143
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,520
at the time for long interval times.

144
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:24,680
This is of diagonal terms and this is the diagonal terms.

145
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,720
And in this region where the spectrum is real,

146
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,720
here we have performed a promedius.

147
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:43,800
We have promedied on two period times the results.

148
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,080
This is where the spectrum is complex.

149
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,280
This is the steady value of the probability.

150
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,040
Well, what is interesting is what happened at this point

151
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,480
where the eigenvalue of coalesce.

152
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,040
As I have said before, for these points,

153
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:19,880
we observe non-exponential k because the matrix related

154
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:29,320
to the transform of the dream function

155
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,000
has a block which corresponds to a Schoeman form

156
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
because the Hamiltonian at this point

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,400
is no longer diagonalizable.

158
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:46,120
And then the consequence of this is that the decay is no longer

159
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:55,320
exponential but we have some potential of t in the spectrum.

160
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:05,720
If we study the survival probability for a coherent state,

161
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,040
for an initial state, prepare as a coherent state

162
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:20,120
with azimuthal axis p over 4 times the system of the qubits

163
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:27,560
in the ground state, we see that the probability,

164
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,320
survival probability, can be written in an analytical form

165
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,720
this way.

166
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:44,600
We observe that we have a factor t square in the numerator

167
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,320
and denominator so that, as a function of time,

168
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,640
this will evolve to a constant.

169
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:06,920
For a given initial state, prepare as an initial state

170
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,960
of the qubits and initial state of the mbis,

171
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,440
the evolved state is given in this way.

172
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,080
And as I have said before, the probability,

173
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,680
survival probability has this expression as usual.

174
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,880
And here we show four different values of alpha,

175
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,000
not the exceptional point.

176
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,800
The exceptional point is this and this.

177
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:44,880
How the probability behaves for a long interval of time

178
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,200
as a function of time.

179
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,720
We see that depending on theta, this corresponds to theta

180
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,120
equals 0, p over 2, p over 4, and p,

181
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,200
the survival probability of the initial state

182
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:14,280
is close to 1 near the exceptional point or goes to 0.

183
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,720
And the opposed behavior in the other exceptional point.

184
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,920
In this branch of parameters where the values are real,

185
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,480
these are the promedio in two periods of time.

186
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,000
What we learn from this is that depending

187
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,160
on the initial state, the survival probability in terms

188
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,160
of the coupling of the asymmetric parameter

189
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,120
is better or not.

190
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,280
Well, let us look at the squeezing parameter.

191
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,280
The squeezing parameter is defined

192
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:11,880
as if we have a system of spins, that is, then this,

193
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,960
for instance, and we look at the mean value of the spin

194
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,360
and define this as the set up prime direction.

195
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,520
Then we look in the perpendicular plane to this direction

196
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:39,120
where for the small component of the deviation of x prime,

197
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,960
that define the parameter of the squeezing of the system.

198
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,800
And if this is reduced in the direction of x prime,

199
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:58,000
sorry, this is because in the perpendicular direction,

200
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,480
it is increased.

201
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,560
When we look at this parameter, we

202
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,560
observe that for the real regime of the spectrum,

203
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,680
when the spectrum is real, the system can be squeezed.

204
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:22,720
But for the points where the spectrum is complex,

205
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,440
the system is anti-squix.

206
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,160
In particular, there is a point here

207
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,280
where the mean value of the spins adopt the value 0.

208
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,760
And for this point here, of course,

209
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,720
this parameter diverge.

210
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,560
And perhaps it is not well defined at this point.

211
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,200
But for this particular point, we observe the following thing.

212
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,600
We observe that if we have an initial state prepared

213
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,680
as a coherent state for instance with theta equal p over 2,

214
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,040
it evolves in time to this particular state, which

215
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:20,000
is composed of the superposition of two coherent states.

216
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,160
This state was identified as a reading

217
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:37,120
at the state by other workers sometime ago.

218
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:45,640
So what happened is that if we prepare an initial state,

219
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:54,760
in this particular cap and I will be particular asymmetry

220
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,760
in the state, the capital interaction,

221
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:09,760
will end with a reading circuit.

222
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,320
These are the plot obtained by computing the beginner

223
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,920
discrete function for the ease U2 model.

224
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Then we can think what happens is we compute this

225
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,920
for a larger number of nb's.

226
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,920
For two nb's, we have, for instance,

227
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:44,920
if we value delta equal 2 times d,

228
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:54,920
this curve will correspond to the appearance

229
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
of the sectional point.

230
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,920
And this curve will correspond to the appearance of cad

231
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,920
states as steady states of the system.

232
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:17,920
When we increase the number of nb's in the system

233
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:25,920
and we redefine the parameter alpha as alpha over

234
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,920
square root of m, this is a collective model.

235
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:38,920
That's why the alpha should be rewritten

236
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,920
as alpha over square root of m.

237
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:52,920
We also found a regular pattern of exceptional points

238
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,920
and a regular pattern of a reading curve

239
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,920
cad states as steady states.

240
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Well, in conclusion, we have shown

241
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,920
that in this type of hybrid systems,

242
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:15,920
we can show the appearance of exceptional points.

243
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:22,920
This is an aspect related to the non-hormitian

244
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,920
dynamic of the system.

245
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Non-exceptional, at non, at exceptional points,

246
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:40,920
we love the exponential decay.

247
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,920
The states, which are no, the matrix,

248
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,920
which is no longer diagonalizable,

249
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,920
admit a normal short-term form,

250
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,920
and then the survivor probability related

251
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,920
to an initially even state at this point

252
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,920
will show a polynomial behavior.

253
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,920
The order of the polynomial corresponds to the

254
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,920
order of the pole in the green matrix

255
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,920
at the exceptional point.

256
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,920
And we also show that in this type of systems,

257
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:38,920
we can create as steady states a reading curve.

258
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,920
If we now couple the system of m best

259
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,920
to more superconducting COVID,

260
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:57,920
we can expect that the structure

261
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,920
or the coexistence of exceptional points

262
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,920
will show a more rich behavior,

263
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,920
and perhaps we have exceptional points

264
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,920
of not only one pair of state coalescing

265
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
to the same eigenstate,

266
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,920
but more eigenstate coalescing to the same states.

267
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,920
And what is an open question,

268
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,920
there is some people working on this,

269
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,920
is what happened with non-ormition systems

270
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,920
at finite temperature.

271
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,920
We have recently begun to work on this work,

272
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,920
but I hope next year we can give some insight on this.

273
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Well, thank you very much for your attention.

274
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Thanks.

275
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Thanks Marta, thanks for this great talk.

276
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Now, if there are some questions,

277
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,920
please write them down in the chat

278
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:10,920
and I will pick them up.

279
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Sebastian, please go ahead.

280
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,920
You can open your mic if you want.

281
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,920
Hello Marta, thank you for your talk.

282
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,920
I think that I know what you think,

283
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,920
but I want to hear from you.

284
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Do you have some interpretation

285
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
or conceptual interpretation

286
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,920
of the meaning of the imaginary part of the energy?

287
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,920
And the second part of the question is,

288
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,920
in this formalism,

289
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,920
change the interpretation of the energy

290
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,920
that we know even in the real part of the energy

291
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,920
or not is the same.

292
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,920
What I have learned till now is that

293
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,920
in generally the parameters

294
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,920
leading to real spectrum,

295
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
when you have real spectrum,

296
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,920
generally you can make a similarly transformation

297
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
to an Hermitian Hamiltonian,

298
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,920
which is at a system with finite number of degrees,

299
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,920
with finite dimension.

300
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,920
So the part of real spectrum,

301
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,920
I think that is almost the same

302
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
as the Hermitian Hamiltonian

303
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,920
through a similar transformation.

304
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,920
The other sector of the model,

305
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,920
is complex energies.

306
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Well, in finite systems,

307
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,920
I will think of the usual concept of loss and gain,

308
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,920
and you say, well,

309
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,920
the eigenvalues have a negative part of the energy,

310
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
of the complex energy,

311
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,920
you are modeling a loss system,

312
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,920
and if you in some way can add things to the system,

313
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:40,920
then you have to have the positive part of the energy,

314
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,920
of the complex energy.

315
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,920
That is for finite systems.

316
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,920
And this was nice.

317
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
There are a lot of experiments,

318
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,920
particularly in optical physics.

319
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,920
I can give you some recent results,

320
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,920
by mail, the reference.

321
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Now, the problem is with infinite dimensional systems.

322
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,920
There we have worked out the model,

323
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,920
I don't know if you are familiar,

324
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,920
the model of Swanson,

325
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,920
the simple model that has is a quadratic model of Bosons,

326
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,920
and once after interaction,

327
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,920
it has an stress different than the other.

328
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,920
And it has a broken symmetric space

329
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,920
that has complex parent values.

330
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,920
And we have learned that with proper choice

331
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,920
of the parameters and with adequate transformation,

332
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,920
we can also make

333
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,920
some relation between the Hamiltonian is a joint.

334
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,920
But now the eigenvalues, the eigenfunctions,

335
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
does not belong to the Hilbert space,

336
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,920
because they are not square integrals.

337
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,920
So you have to use the formalings of the Elphan template.

338
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,920
And then, when you look at the time evolution in this case,

339
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
you have to be carefully,

340
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
you have to do it carefully,

341
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,920
because it is not a resonant and anti-resonant state

342
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:44,920
as stated the other day, Manuel Gadella.

343
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,920
They are, the time rebels are one of the other,

344
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,920
and then you have to make the evolution with the resonant states

345
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,920
for T greater than zero

346
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:05,920
and with the anti-resonant state with T less than zero.

347
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,920
And it is, as Manuel said,

348
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:17,920
it is tricky because you have to deal with,

349
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,920
sometimes with metric operation that with similar operators

350
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,920
that are not definitely positive define,

351
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,920
and so you have to look at the metric and so on.

352
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,920
There is still too much to do.

353
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,920
A lot of things to do.

354
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Okay. Thank you, Martin.

355
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Okay. We are on time.

356
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,920
So we thank Marta for this great talk.

357
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,920
So we put some internet claps.
