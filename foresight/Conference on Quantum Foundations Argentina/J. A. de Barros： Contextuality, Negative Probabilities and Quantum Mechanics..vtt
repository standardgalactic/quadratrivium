WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.440
OK, well, it's kind of like a hard task

00:06.440 --> 00:09.160
to start after such a great talk.

00:09.160 --> 00:12.240
I didn't get the whole talk.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.280
It's the end of the semester here,

00:14.280 --> 00:16.560
but it was very interesting what I saw,

00:16.560 --> 00:20.400
and I'm going to sure read more about it.

00:20.400 --> 00:26.120
So what I want to talk today is about negative probabilities

00:26.120 --> 00:29.280
in quantum mechanics, and in particular with respect

00:29.280 --> 00:30.600
to contextuality.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.320
And I think it ties a little bit with the previous talk,

00:34.320 --> 00:37.960
because you can think of that as a way of describing

00:37.960 --> 00:42.520
certain quantum systems that's epistemic.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.760
But at the end of the day, my interest

00:45.760 --> 00:53.240
is in trying to rule out some possible ontological models

00:53.240 --> 00:54.360
as well.

00:54.360 --> 01:01.960
Anyway, so here's the outline of my talk today.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.160
I'm going to start with trying to give some motivation

01:04.160 --> 01:07.400
about negative probabilities, and then

01:07.400 --> 01:11.200
I'm going to talk about how is it that negative probabilities

01:11.200 --> 01:16.760
actually come into this story through contextuality.

01:16.760 --> 01:21.320
And then after that, I'm going to give a definition

01:21.320 --> 01:26.840
of negative probabilities that is more formal than usually one

01:26.840 --> 01:27.680
would find.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.480
And there is a reason for doing that,

01:29.480 --> 01:33.960
and hopefully the motivation is going to make it clear

01:33.960 --> 01:35.560
what is the reason.

01:35.560 --> 01:41.000
So the starting point is the realization

01:41.000 --> 01:44.800
that quantum mechanics, as the previous speaker mentioned,

01:44.800 --> 01:48.840
is a probability theory, in a certain sense.

01:48.840 --> 01:52.120
So what we have in quantum mechanics

01:52.120 --> 01:56.120
is a state for a physical system.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.720
And that state is a vector in a hyperspace,

01:58.720 --> 02:00.480
or a density matrix, whatever.

02:00.480 --> 02:05.080
And we can use that state to infer outcomes of experiments

02:05.080 --> 02:06.000
probabilistically.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.240
So that's what quantum theory gives us,

02:08.240 --> 02:16.280
is this probabilistic description of physical systems.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.600
However, this probabilistic description

02:19.600 --> 02:24.400
that quantum theory gives to us is not fully compatible

02:24.400 --> 02:26.240
with classical probability theory,

02:26.240 --> 02:31.520
in the sense that for some set of observables

02:31.520 --> 02:35.640
for a quantum system, if we look at the experimental outcomes

02:35.640 --> 02:40.280
that quantum theory predicts, you cannot have a joint

02:40.280 --> 02:43.880
probability distribution that describes all those observables

02:43.880 --> 02:46.280
within classical theory.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.480
We have kind of like a name for that.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.680
We say that those theories are contextual.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.520
And in the section about contextuality,

02:53.520 --> 02:57.760
I'm going to outline a little bit more detail of what we mean

02:57.760 --> 03:03.640
by that for those who are not aware of that.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.400
Probably all of you are, but anyway.

03:07.400 --> 03:13.600
So since we cannot describe quantum mechanics

03:13.600 --> 03:16.000
with classic probability theory, it's

03:16.000 --> 03:20.240
natural to ask whether we can modify classic probability theory

03:20.240 --> 03:22.280
to describe quantum systems.

03:22.280 --> 03:27.760
So is it possible that some different probability theory

03:27.760 --> 03:31.680
can actually help us get a better understanding of what's

03:31.680 --> 03:35.200
going on in these quantum systems?

03:35.200 --> 03:39.360
And there are different ways to modify

03:39.360 --> 03:42.240
classic probability theory.

03:42.280 --> 03:46.360
One of them is, well, actually, quantum theory itself,

03:46.360 --> 03:50.000
where we use a probability that's over vectors

03:50.000 --> 03:51.360
in hybrid space.

03:51.360 --> 03:55.320
And that effectively modifies probability theory,

03:55.320 --> 03:58.520
in the sense that not everything is commasurable.

03:58.520 --> 04:01.640
And the algebra of events that you have

04:01.640 --> 04:04.360
is restricted to a lattice.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.520
So you don't have the standard Boolean algebra

04:06.520 --> 04:07.440
of all the events.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.680
And you cannot give a measure of all the events

04:09.680 --> 04:11.160
at the same time.

04:11.160 --> 04:14.000
So that's one possibility is modifying

04:14.000 --> 04:16.280
the algebra of classic probabilities,

04:16.280 --> 04:20.520
because classic probabilities assumes that the events

04:20.520 --> 04:23.720
form an algebra that's a Boolean algebra.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.800
The other way is to modify the additivity rule.

04:27.800 --> 04:35.640
We know, for example, that probability theory, if two sets

04:36.320 --> 04:41.120
belong to this algebra of measurable events,

04:41.120 --> 04:43.960
they are compute.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.760
We compute the probability of those two sets,

04:45.760 --> 04:47.920
the disjoint sets.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.960
Together, the probability of two disjoint sets

04:50.960 --> 04:53.160
is the sum of those probabilities of those sets.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.440
So that's the additivity rule.

04:54.440 --> 04:55.760
So one of the things that we can do

04:55.760 --> 04:58.760
is we can modify that additivity rule.

04:58.760 --> 05:02.040
And that's something that comes out

05:02.040 --> 05:06.480
of definite work on upper and lower probabilities.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.720
And the other possibility is the one

05:08.720 --> 05:11.000
that we're going to be following here

05:11.000 --> 05:17.720
is to modify probabilities such that we don't restrict ourselves

05:17.720 --> 05:20.160
to non-negative values.

05:20.160 --> 05:24.320
So those are ways of extending probability theory.

05:24.320 --> 05:31.080
And so when we think about negative probabilities

05:32.040 --> 05:39.840
or probabilities where the non-negativity of probabilities

05:39.840 --> 05:43.920
is denied, we need to think about it carefully.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.680
And how exactly do we want to define that?

05:46.680 --> 05:49.360
So what we're going to be trying to do today

05:49.360 --> 05:52.760
is introduce a way to describe quantum systems that

05:52.760 --> 05:56.040
violate this non-negatives, the negativeness property,

05:56.040 --> 06:02.560
such that we have, first, a major theoretic formalism that

06:02.560 --> 06:05.200
does that, and second, that we capture

06:05.200 --> 06:09.280
the essence of what we want to have in quantum systems

06:09.280 --> 06:13.480
and physical systems in that theory of probability.

06:13.480 --> 06:18.280
So that's essentially what we want to do today.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.640
So let's start with contextuality.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.440
And I'm going to have a little bit

06:23.440 --> 06:28.000
of a weird, non-historic approach to contextuality

06:28.000 --> 06:29.760
that starts with a historic comment, which

06:29.760 --> 06:33.080
is contextuality originated.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.560
The idea of contextuality originates in language.

06:35.560 --> 06:40.240
And it was well known in the 20th century

06:40.240 --> 06:43.920
in works in pragmatics, for example.

06:43.920 --> 06:48.000
But take the sentence, marry a student near the bank,

06:48.000 --> 06:48.920
observing people.

06:49.920 --> 06:54.120
We can understand the sentence differently,

06:54.120 --> 06:57.480
depending on whether it's preceded or it's followed

06:57.480 --> 06:59.840
by distinct sentences.

06:59.840 --> 07:03.000
For example, take this very same sentence followed

07:03.000 --> 07:04.760
by this statement.

07:04.760 --> 07:08.600
She paused to notice a child amuse herself

07:08.600 --> 07:10.480
with the fishes jumping in the river.

07:10.480 --> 07:14.000
When we read that sentence and we read the first one

07:14.000 --> 07:17.280
together of the second one about a child looking

07:17.280 --> 07:18.900
at fishes in the river, we understand

07:18.900 --> 07:23.180
that bank refers to the bank of a river.

07:23.180 --> 07:25.860
But if, on the other hand, instead of this,

07:25.860 --> 07:28.740
we followed marry a student near the bank,

07:28.740 --> 07:31.260
with this sentence, she noticed the manager punctually

07:31.260 --> 07:34.900
leaving at noon, something that would help with the heist.

07:34.900 --> 07:37.980
We associate bank not with the bank of a river,

07:37.980 --> 07:41.820
but we associate it with a financial institution,

07:41.820 --> 07:44.860
the physical manifestation of a financial institution.

07:44.940 --> 07:51.580
So in this example, the first sentence,

07:51.580 --> 07:54.940
how we understand it, changes of the context

07:54.940 --> 08:00.660
when it's put together with this child looking at fishes,

08:00.660 --> 08:03.500
when it's put together with heist.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.940
So that is the sense in which linguists talk

08:05.940 --> 08:08.980
about contextuality of language.

08:08.980 --> 08:13.180
And we can understand contextuality of language

08:13.180 --> 08:18.380
in terms of a very logic approach to language, which

08:18.380 --> 08:22.300
is the truth functional approach, in which propositions

08:22.300 --> 08:28.300
are the way in which we understand meaning of sentences.

08:28.300 --> 08:32.020
So like, for example, take the two propositions, A and B,

08:32.020 --> 08:34.660
A being marry a student near the river bank,

08:34.660 --> 08:37.460
and B being marry a student near the building

08:37.460 --> 08:39.860
of a financial institution.

08:39.860 --> 08:43.300
Those two sentences, they have different truth values

08:43.300 --> 08:44.340
depending on the context.

08:44.340 --> 08:47.540
In the context of river, A is true and B is false,

08:47.540 --> 08:51.820
whereas in the context of heist, A is false and B is true.

08:51.820 --> 08:56.980
So it's in this sense of truth values

08:56.980 --> 08:59.140
that we can understand contextuality

08:59.140 --> 09:03.980
and actually even relates contextuality in language

09:03.980 --> 09:06.660
to contextuality in quantum mechanics

09:06.660 --> 09:10.020
via random variables.

09:10.020 --> 09:12.660
So let's look at how contextuality in this case

09:12.660 --> 09:15.380
will show up in terms of random variables.

09:15.380 --> 09:19.020
So we can think about those statements A and B

09:19.020 --> 09:22.860
as being modeled by random variables A and B.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.820
I'm going to represent them in both face here

09:24.820 --> 09:27.020
just to distinguish between the statements A and B,

09:27.020 --> 09:32.420
the propositions A and B. And these random variables A and B

09:32.420 --> 09:36.260
modeled it by being dichotomous random variables

09:36.300 --> 09:38.980
with values plus and minus one.

09:38.980 --> 09:41.100
With minus one, for example, corresponding

09:41.100 --> 09:44.300
to the statement being false and plus one corresponding

09:44.300 --> 09:45.740
to the statement being true.

09:45.740 --> 09:48.500
It's kind of like silly to think about random variables

09:48.500 --> 09:53.500
for this particular example because they are not,

09:56.940 --> 09:58.580
they're deterministic random variables

09:58.580 --> 10:01.180
because once a statement is true,

10:01.180 --> 10:04.220
A is always going to be one, right?

10:04.220 --> 10:08.100
And if B is false, B is always going to be minus one.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.620
So it's kind of silly to think about

10:09.620 --> 10:10.540
in terms of random variables,

10:10.540 --> 10:13.500
but there's nothing that forbids us from doing that.

10:13.500 --> 10:17.060
And contextuality here means that there is no single

10:17.060 --> 10:21.700
random variable A and B that represents those concepts

10:21.700 --> 10:24.300
A and B in different contexts,

10:25.620 --> 10:28.060
or represent those truth values in different contexts.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.660
The reason is that a random variable is defined

10:30.660 --> 10:34.180
within a probability space.

10:34.180 --> 10:37.580
And the probabilities, they cannot represent

10:37.580 --> 10:40.380
both A and B simultaneously.

10:40.380 --> 10:45.380
So this is the contextuality that comes in linguistics.

10:46.340 --> 10:51.340
It's, we can call this as a direct influence

10:51.340 --> 10:54.140
of the context on the random variables

10:54.140 --> 10:57.620
because the expectations of the random variables

10:57.620 --> 10:59.500
change directly with the context.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.260
In one context, the expectation of A is one,

11:02.260 --> 11:06.380
in another context, the expectation of A is minus one.

11:06.380 --> 11:08.860
So the expectation changes the context.

11:08.860 --> 11:12.260
This is not what happens in physics

11:12.260 --> 11:15.380
because this type of contextuality

11:15.380 --> 11:18.020
would violate the signaling condition,

11:18.020 --> 11:21.100
but that's a way of representing the linguistic type

11:21.100 --> 11:23.860
of contextuality in terms of random variables.

11:23.860 --> 11:27.660
But once we have that idea of contextuality as changing

11:27.660 --> 11:30.220
the expectations of random variables

11:31.260 --> 11:36.060
in, with respect to the context,

11:36.060 --> 11:38.020
we kind of like have a clue of how is it

11:38.020 --> 11:39.620
that we can extend that to things

11:39.620 --> 11:41.380
that might be more relevant to physics.

11:41.380 --> 11:45.180
So let's take a more subtle case, right?

11:45.180 --> 11:50.180
Let's take three, that column was random variables x, y, and z.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.960
So plus or minus one random variables.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.760
And let's just assume that their expectation is zero.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.240
So we don't know, it's kind of like tossing a coin

12:01.240 --> 12:02.400
for x, y, and z.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.080
We don't know whether it's true or false

12:05.080 --> 12:07.960
every time that we observe it,

12:07.960 --> 12:11.960
but they're perfectly correlated among themselves.

12:11.960 --> 12:16.960
So x is perfectly anti-correlated with y,

12:16.960 --> 12:19.240
x is perfectly anti-correlated with z,

12:19.240 --> 12:22.840
and perfectly anti-correlated with z and y.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.280
Z and y are perfectly anti-correlated.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.440
And it's a very straightforward to see that

12:27.440 --> 12:32.040
if we have such cases where x, y, x, z, and y, z

12:32.040 --> 12:35.600
are anti-correlated, that there is something funky going on.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.800
And the way to see there is something funky going on

12:38.800 --> 12:42.280
is just to notice that, for example, if x equals one,

12:42.280 --> 12:45.400
this guy here implies that y equals minus one.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.600
And if x equals one, this guy here implies

12:47.600 --> 12:49.040
that z equals minus one.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.000
But minus one times minus one is one.

12:55.040 --> 13:00.040
However, this guy here tells us that y times z is minus one,

13:00.400 --> 13:02.080
which is a contradiction.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.720
So there is something wrong going on.

13:04.720 --> 13:09.280
And what is wrong is that when we're using this reasoning

13:09.280 --> 13:14.280
of x being implying y equals minus one here

13:14.480 --> 13:16.880
in this first equation, and then we're using it

13:16.880 --> 13:19.640
as implying z here in this second equation,

13:19.640 --> 13:21.880
and then using to get the multiplication

13:21.880 --> 13:23.640
in the third equation, we're assuming

13:23.640 --> 13:27.280
that all three random variables are defined together.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.200
That means that we're assuming there's a joint

13:29.200 --> 13:30.520
probability distribution.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.720
But it doesn't exist.

13:33.720 --> 13:37.200
Assuming that x in the context of y is the same

13:37.200 --> 13:39.560
as x in the context of z is what's leading

13:39.560 --> 13:42.280
as your contradiction, assuming that all three of them

13:42.280 --> 13:44.320
are observable at the same time

13:44.320 --> 13:45.800
is leading as your contradictions.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.400
And we know that this happens in quantum mechanics,

13:48.400 --> 13:51.800
that there are things that we cannot absorb at the same time.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.600
So can we see something like that in quantum mechanics?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.360
And the answer is yes.

13:56.360 --> 14:00.320
A very famous example is the GHZ states.

14:00.320 --> 14:04.040
We have three particles, one, two, and three,

14:04.040 --> 14:08.880
that are in an entangled state where either all three

14:08.880 --> 14:12.360
of them have spin in the direction z being plus,

14:12.360 --> 14:16.240
or all three of them have spin in the direction z being minus,

14:16.240 --> 14:19.280
and then we have a superposition of those two states.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.680
And then it's easy to see that these guys

14:21.680 --> 14:25.680
have the following eigenstates.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.280
For example, if we measure spin of particle one

14:28.280 --> 14:31.040
in the direction x, measure spin in the particle two

14:31.040 --> 14:34.240
in the direction y, and three in the direction y,

14:34.240 --> 14:37.360
the product of those three spins is always gonna be one.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.040
In the other hand, if we measure y, x, y,

14:41.040 --> 14:44.120
it's also gonna be one, y, y, x is also one,

14:44.120 --> 14:47.000
but x, x, x is minus one.

14:48.320 --> 14:53.320
So we can try to look at it in terms of random variables.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.440
Let's say we have an x-random variable

14:56.440 --> 14:59.600
for spin in the direction x, a y-random variable

14:59.600 --> 15:01.440
for spin in the direction y,

15:01.440 --> 15:05.000
and then we assume them to be context independent.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.080
And if we do that, we can multiply this guy here,

15:09.080 --> 15:12.200
the random variables corresponding to this spin,

15:12.200 --> 15:17.200
x, y, y, times the spin y, x, y, times y, y, x,

15:18.320 --> 15:22.280
and each one of those guys in parentheses are equal to one.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.360
And when we multiply them, we can now collect

15:25.360 --> 15:28.480
all the y's together and all the x's together,

15:28.480 --> 15:30.400
and the square of something that's closer

15:30.400 --> 15:33.160
minus one is always one.

15:33.160 --> 15:36.700
And when we do that, this guy here's one,

15:36.700 --> 15:40.780
and we get a contradiction that one is equal to minus one

15:40.780 --> 15:44.960
from this quantum mechanical computation.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.340
Of course, it's not a contradiction

15:46.340 --> 15:49.460
because what we're getting as contradiction

15:49.460 --> 15:54.460
is based on the assumption that the y in the context of x

15:54.900 --> 15:58.740
and y, y two in the context of x one and y three

15:58.740 --> 16:03.220
is the same as the y two in the context of y one and x three.

16:03.220 --> 16:04.060
So in other words,

16:04.060 --> 16:06.580
we're assuming a joint probability distribution.

16:08.500 --> 16:13.500
So when we have a set of random variables

16:17.900 --> 16:20.340
that are contextual,

16:20.340 --> 16:22.340
there is no joint probability distribution

16:22.340 --> 16:23.460
for all the variables.

16:23.460 --> 16:26.000
There is, of course, a joint probability distribution

16:26.000 --> 16:28.180
for each one of those contexts,

16:28.180 --> 16:30.940
but when you put all those six random variables together,

16:30.940 --> 16:32.420
there is no joint probability distribution.

16:32.420 --> 16:35.220
There's no single probability space,

16:36.140 --> 16:41.140
omega fp such that the random variables xi and yi

16:41.700 --> 16:43.580
models all the quantum outcomes.

16:43.580 --> 16:48.580
That's not possible in standard probability theory.

16:54.060 --> 16:56.180
Of course, we know that the quantum formalism

16:56.180 --> 16:57.940
provides an answer.

16:57.940 --> 17:01.500
We can use the quantum formalism as we shown here

17:01.540 --> 17:05.260
to compute the expectations of actual observables

17:05.260 --> 17:06.940
that we can measure together,

17:08.220 --> 17:10.340
but are there alternatives to quantum model?

17:10.340 --> 17:12.740
And more importantly,

17:12.740 --> 17:17.180
are there alternatives to the quantum model useful for us

17:17.180 --> 17:21.260
to think about what's going on with the quantum case?

17:22.180 --> 17:24.860
We don't know whether those alternatives are useful,

17:24.860 --> 17:28.060
but we feel that perhaps understanding them better

17:28.060 --> 17:32.180
might be a way to at least understand

17:32.180 --> 17:35.140
what is it that they can bring to this discussion

17:35.140 --> 17:37.620
of what the quantum model or quantum,

17:37.620 --> 17:40.220
of what the hub or space formula is telling us.

17:40.220 --> 17:42.380
So the alternatives that have been tried,

17:42.380 --> 17:44.620
as I mentioned, are upper and lower probabilities,

17:44.620 --> 17:46.860
and of course, there are negative probabilities

17:46.860 --> 17:49.820
that we wanna expand more today.

17:50.780 --> 17:54.600
So let's go into defining negative probabilities.

17:59.060 --> 18:02.260
To understand how we define negative probabilities,

18:02.260 --> 18:06.500
it's useful to see how we define standard probability theory.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.340
Right?

18:07.340 --> 18:10.020
So the most accepted definition

18:10.020 --> 18:13.500
of standard probability theory is by Komagorov.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.540
He gave a set theoretic definition

18:16.540 --> 18:19.860
of classic probability theory as being the triplets,

18:19.860 --> 18:24.860
omega Fp, where omega is a sample space that you have.

18:28.260 --> 18:33.260
F is an algebra over that sample space omega

18:34.220 --> 18:39.220
that is actually a sigma algebra, a countable algebra,

18:41.300 --> 18:45.660
and P is a function that takes elements of this algebra

18:45.660 --> 18:48.740
to this interval zero and one.

18:48.740 --> 18:51.420
And the restrictions that we have for P

18:51.420 --> 18:55.460
is that the measure of omega or the whole set

18:55.460 --> 18:58.380
of possibilities is equal to one.

18:58.380 --> 18:59.700
In other words, the probability

18:59.700 --> 19:04.700
that something happens is one.

19:04.700 --> 19:09.700
And the other assumption is that the additivity rule

19:12.700 --> 19:16.300
holds for this function.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.540
In other words, for any denumerable

19:18.540 --> 19:22.940
and this joint family of elements of this algebra F, Ai,

19:23.900 --> 19:28.900
the probability of A, say A1 or A2

19:30.940 --> 19:34.660
is the sum of the probability of A and the probability of two.

19:34.660 --> 19:38.260
So that's something that's a requirement

19:38.260 --> 19:40.380
of probability theory.

19:40.380 --> 19:44.820
And because this is a number between zero and one,

19:44.820 --> 19:46.500
this probability is monotonic.

19:46.500 --> 19:51.500
So if you have a set A, the probability of adding something

19:51.500 --> 19:54.540
more to that set A, that's this joint of A,

19:54.540 --> 19:58.500
increases the probability of absorbing that event.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.780
So if you add more possibilities,

20:00.780 --> 20:02.580
this becomes more probable.

20:02.580 --> 20:07.580
And in quantum mechanics, this is not quite the case.

20:07.940 --> 20:11.100
It's non-monotonic, but this is something

20:11.100 --> 20:14.020
that I'm not gonna talk too much about.

20:14.020 --> 20:16.060
So how do we get negative probabilities?

20:16.060 --> 20:19.420
We might be tempted to just violate this requirement

20:19.420 --> 20:21.420
and we're done with it.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.300
But the problem is that there are certain constraints

20:24.300 --> 20:25.700
about negative probabilities

20:25.700 --> 20:29.620
that at least seem to make sense,

20:29.620 --> 20:32.980
which is that first and foremost,

20:32.980 --> 20:35.500
we never directly observe a negative probability.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.300
What the heck does it mean to even observe

20:37.300 --> 20:38.540
a negative probability?

20:40.500 --> 20:42.740
So we need to understand how exactly

20:42.740 --> 20:45.100
does the negative probability show

20:45.100 --> 20:48.420
in terms of directly observable quantities.

20:48.540 --> 20:52.100
And observables are not parts of komagorov stock.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.900
So we need to include that.

20:53.900 --> 20:57.460
And furthermore, there's no connection

20:57.460 --> 21:02.220
if we just like relax this requirement

21:02.220 --> 21:07.220
that ties the marginals to the empirical observable contexts.

21:07.220 --> 21:10.700
So what we're gonna do here is just try to show

21:10.700 --> 21:12.340
how we can define negative probabilities

21:12.340 --> 21:13.380
with those ideas in mind.

21:13.380 --> 21:16.860
So that's our major theoretic definition

21:16.860 --> 21:18.300
of negative probabilities.

21:20.580 --> 21:25.380
It's gonna be a little bit abstract from now on,

21:25.380 --> 21:28.020
but I'm gonna try to give the main ideas

21:28.020 --> 21:31.300
of what is the outlining of this definition, right?

21:31.300 --> 21:35.980
We start with a sample space, not a sample space.

21:35.980 --> 21:39.940
We start with the concept of assigned measure.

21:39.940 --> 21:44.580
So assigned measure is exactly the same as a measure,

21:44.620 --> 21:47.700
except that instead of having a measure

21:47.700 --> 21:51.460
going from a sigma algebra to the set

21:51.460 --> 21:53.980
of non-negative real numbers,

21:53.980 --> 21:58.060
assigned measure is something that takes the sets

21:58.060 --> 22:03.060
of elements of the algebra into any real number,

22:04.180 --> 22:05.740
including negative numbers.

22:06.420 --> 22:10.020
And this is well known in measure theory.

22:10.020 --> 22:13.740
So it's something that has been studied extensively.

22:13.740 --> 22:17.620
And essentially, if we restrict the assigned measure

22:17.620 --> 22:20.820
to non-negative numbers, we get a regular measure.

22:20.820 --> 22:22.780
And if we restrict this measure

22:22.780 --> 22:27.780
such that mu of omega for this measure is equal to one,

22:31.060 --> 22:32.980
we get probabilities.

22:32.980 --> 22:36.900
So that's the starting point.

22:36.900 --> 22:39.220
We start with assigned measure space

22:39.220 --> 22:43.660
that has the additivity rule as part of it.

22:43.660 --> 22:47.340
And then once we have this assigned measure space,

22:47.340 --> 22:49.180
we need to find a way to connect it

22:49.180 --> 22:53.060
to the actual observations that we have.

22:53.060 --> 22:57.900
And the starting point is to create an object

22:57.900 --> 23:00.260
that's not quite a random variable,

23:00.260 --> 23:02.620
but it's what we call an extended random variable

23:02.620 --> 23:06.260
because instead of being defined over a probability space,

23:06.260 --> 23:11.260
we're defining it into assigned measure space.

23:12.140 --> 23:16.180
And the idea is just that if the assigned measure space

23:16.180 --> 23:17.740
then becomes a probability space,

23:17.740 --> 23:20.420
those random variables become regular random variables.

23:21.380 --> 23:24.780
And the definition is just the standard definition

23:24.780 --> 23:27.300
of random variable where you have a function

23:27.300 --> 23:29.180
that goes from your sample space

23:29.180 --> 23:34.180
to some real number M that's parts of a sets.

23:36.220 --> 23:39.140
This should be this M here, something wrong here.

23:39.260 --> 23:41.900
Anyway, and such that this function

23:41.900 --> 23:44.100
is a measurable function in the sense

23:44.100 --> 23:45.780
of this measure that we have.

23:45.780 --> 23:48.900
It's a measure induced definition.

23:49.900 --> 23:53.220
And then from this, we can kind of like start

23:53.220 --> 23:57.020
to narrow down the idea of contexts.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.620
And contexts are just proper subsets

23:59.620 --> 24:01.300
of those random variables,

24:01.300 --> 24:05.220
such that there is a sub sigma algebra

24:05.220 --> 24:08.500
for each one of those subsets of the random variables.

24:09.220 --> 24:14.220
That define a probability space

24:16.100 --> 24:18.540
for those random variables there.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.780
So intuitively we'll have this bunch

24:20.780 --> 24:23.300
of extended random variables.

24:23.300 --> 24:24.940
And we have this measure space

24:24.940 --> 24:27.140
describing those extended random variables.

24:27.140 --> 24:29.740
But then we get a subspace of that.

24:29.740 --> 24:34.140
And this subspace has a measure space associated to it

24:34.140 --> 24:37.380
such that we actually have proper random variables

24:37.380 --> 24:38.620
in this subspace.

24:39.980 --> 24:44.980
And this allows us to talk now

24:46.660 --> 24:49.740
about families of signed probabilistic models

24:49.740 --> 24:54.380
that have just those contexts defined for those families

24:54.380 --> 24:56.740
and then measures in this context.

24:56.740 --> 24:59.820
I'm gonna skip a little bit faster in this.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.780
And then once we do that,

25:03.780 --> 25:08.700
we can find a concept of a general context

25:08.700 --> 25:12.460
that just has like the same idea of the broader one.

25:12.460 --> 25:16.820
But now we're saying that those are just for those guys

25:16.820 --> 25:21.620
that look like probabilities in the subspace.

25:23.500 --> 25:28.500
So finally, we have like those families

25:29.980 --> 25:32.460
of signed probability models.

25:32.460 --> 25:34.500
And those families of signed probability models,

25:34.500 --> 25:37.740
what you have are those like functions

25:37.740 --> 25:39.900
that reproduce all the expectations

25:39.900 --> 25:42.640
that you have on the contexts.

25:42.640 --> 25:46.500
But it's kind of like the wild west here

25:46.500 --> 25:49.860
because they can be as large or as small as you want.

25:49.860 --> 25:53.700
And what we need to do then is tame a little bit

25:53.700 --> 25:55.900
those set of functions by saying,

25:55.900 --> 26:00.900
look, if we now take the sum of all the probabilities,

26:00.940 --> 26:04.180
the extended probabilities that we have

26:04.180 --> 26:09.180
over the sample space for each one of those elements

26:09.980 --> 26:15.020
of this signed probability spaces, we get a value.

26:15.020 --> 26:19.660
And what we want are the smallest possible values possible

26:19.660 --> 26:20.980
because when that happens,

26:20.980 --> 26:23.620
we're as close as we can be

26:23.620 --> 26:25.860
to a proper probability distribution.

26:25.860 --> 26:30.220
In fact, this is gonna come up in a theorem later on.

26:30.220 --> 26:31.300
And when we do that,

26:31.300 --> 26:34.660
when we ask for the minimum value of the sum,

26:35.580 --> 26:39.340
then we call that a negative probability space.

26:39.340 --> 26:43.380
It's when this minimum is obtained.

26:45.020 --> 26:48.160
If we do that, then we have the following theorem.

26:49.300 --> 26:52.020
Imagine that you have now this guy

26:52.020 --> 26:54.620
as a minimum signed probability space

26:54.620 --> 26:56.660
or as a negative probability space.

26:57.660 --> 27:02.660
So if this M defined as the sum of the probabilities

27:04.020 --> 27:08.220
of elements of the sample space is equal to one,

27:08.220 --> 27:10.860
then this is a probability space.

27:10.860 --> 27:13.620
It's very intuitive to see why that is.

27:13.620 --> 27:17.340
It's because if you remove the absolute value of this,

27:17.340 --> 27:19.440
this is just the probability of omega,

27:19.440 --> 27:21.820
which is always one for a probability space.

27:21.820 --> 27:24.780
And what you're saying is that nothing is pulling

27:24.780 --> 27:26.940
that probability higher or lower

27:26.940 --> 27:28.540
because the sum of the absolute values

27:28.540 --> 27:30.820
is the same as the sum without absolute values.

27:30.820 --> 27:33.080
There's nothing negative here.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.620
It's all non-negative.

27:34.620 --> 27:36.380
So this is also a probability space.

27:36.380 --> 27:40.340
And alternatively, if this guy,

27:40.340 --> 27:43.020
it's missing the both face omega here,

27:43.020 --> 27:45.740
but if this is a probability space,

27:45.740 --> 27:50.740
then it's also a signed probability space of M equals one.

27:50.780 --> 27:54.500
Additionally, a collection of extended random variables

27:54.540 --> 27:56.340
of this space is contextual,

27:56.340 --> 28:00.420
if and only if M is not one.

28:01.900 --> 28:06.900
So we have here criteria for contextuality

28:07.940 --> 28:12.820
just showing up in the definition of negative probabilities.

28:12.820 --> 28:16.020
I'm gonna skip this because I'm running out of time,

28:18.700 --> 28:22.700
but this is how you can connect it to a quantum mechanics.

28:25.020 --> 28:27.300
I gotta say there are lots of different ways

28:27.300 --> 28:29.700
in which negative probabilities connect to a quantum mechanics.

28:29.700 --> 28:34.020
For example, the previous speaker mentioned about PR boxes.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.940
You can, as long as you have no signaling,

28:38.940 --> 28:41.180
you can describe any correlations

28:41.180 --> 28:42.660
in terms of negative probabilities.

28:42.660 --> 28:46.260
So you can describe PR boxes in terms of negative probabilities.

28:46.260 --> 28:51.020
You can describe GHC in terms of negative probabilities

28:51.020 --> 28:53.440
or Bell in terms of negative probabilities.

28:54.440 --> 28:58.440
But a natural question that often comes up

29:01.360 --> 29:03.640
comes up in this discussion of negative probabilities

29:03.640 --> 29:05.720
is what are the interpretations

29:05.720 --> 29:08.800
that we can give to a negative probabilities?

29:10.680 --> 29:13.640
I'm gonna talk about three possible interpretations.

29:14.920 --> 29:18.960
Andrei Krenikov, he uses

29:19.960 --> 29:24.800
a piatic matrix to give an interpretation

29:24.800 --> 29:28.480
of negative probabilities as a violation

29:28.480 --> 29:32.800
of von Mises principle of stability.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.920
So as we know,

29:39.120 --> 29:41.840
if you wanna have a frequentist interpretation

29:41.840 --> 29:44.400
of probabilities, what are probabilities?

29:44.400 --> 29:48.000
And von Mises defines probabilities

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
as being over infinite sequences

29:53.920 --> 29:58.520
of possible outcomes on the sample space,

29:58.520 --> 30:00.640
of possible values in the sample space.

30:01.760 --> 30:05.640
And those probabilities are only defined

30:05.640 --> 30:07.560
for those infinite sequences

30:07.560 --> 30:09.640
if they converge to a number.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.240
So that's what Mises principle of stability.

30:12.240 --> 30:17.240
So what Krenikov noticed is that for certain sequences

30:17.880 --> 30:20.640
that violate the principle of stability,

30:20.640 --> 30:23.360
you can actually define probabilities for them

30:23.360 --> 30:27.000
if you use a piatic metric.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
And when you do that, the sequences that violate

30:33.440 --> 30:35.040
von Mises principle of stability

30:35.040 --> 30:37.600
actually take negative values.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.680
So that's the interpretation that he gives,

30:40.680 --> 30:43.800
is that negative probabilities are associated with numbers

30:43.800 --> 30:46.640
that violate the principle of stability,

30:46.640 --> 30:50.360
which in terms of like, if you are trying to understand,

30:50.360 --> 30:53.200
for example, Bell correlations,

30:53.200 --> 30:55.600
it means that those sequences

30:55.600 --> 30:57.800
that you're assuming to be independent,

30:57.800 --> 30:59.480
they're not actually independent.

31:00.480 --> 31:01.800
Because...

31:01.800 --> 31:05.440
You have 10 minutes including the question.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.920
Oh yeah, I'm just finishing it.

31:07.920 --> 31:10.400
Just finishing the rotations.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.240
Thanks.

31:11.680 --> 31:16.680
So another interpretation is proposed

31:17.000 --> 31:18.720
by Bromsky and Brandenburger.

31:18.720 --> 31:22.000
It's actually based on the composition theorem

31:22.000 --> 31:25.640
that shows that if you have a signed measure,

31:25.640 --> 31:27.880
you can always break it down into two measures,

31:27.880 --> 31:30.440
one positive and one negative,

31:30.440 --> 31:33.920
and each one of them independently are non-signed measures.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.600
And what they do is they just attach a sign

31:36.600 --> 31:40.680
to each one of the outcomes of an experiment,

31:40.680 --> 31:41.960
and then those signs,

31:41.960 --> 31:44.680
they lead to cancellation of certain events.

31:45.640 --> 31:46.920
There's a third interpretation,

31:46.920 --> 31:48.520
which is the one put forth by Derrack

31:48.520 --> 31:49.760
and later on by Feynman,

31:51.360 --> 31:54.280
which is that probabilities,

31:54.280 --> 31:56.600
negative probabilities for that matter,

31:56.600 --> 32:00.000
are just a bookkeeping device.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.760
So in that sense,

32:04.760 --> 32:06.920
negative probabilities are nothing more

32:07.520 --> 32:11.400
than the same as we do with negative numbers.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.440
So for example,

32:12.440 --> 32:15.440
we never observe a negative number of apples.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.320
In fact, it's nonsensical to talk about

32:17.320 --> 32:20.640
a negative number of numbers as an actual observable,

32:20.640 --> 32:24.880
but it doesn't mean that using negative numbers of apples

32:24.880 --> 32:27.760
is not a useful book counting device.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.160
We never observe a negative number of dollars

32:31.160 --> 32:32.480
for that matter either.

32:32.480 --> 32:36.880
It doesn't mean that one never has negative numbers

32:36.880 --> 32:39.640
in an account as a bookkeeping device

32:39.640 --> 32:41.760
for how much money we have in an account.

32:42.880 --> 32:47.880
And the reason why I'm mentioning numbers here

32:49.400 --> 32:52.680
is because the concept of even using negative numbers

32:53.640 --> 32:57.400
has not been always non-controversial.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.800
Consider, for example,

32:58.800 --> 33:00.360
the following quote by De Morgan,

33:00.360 --> 33:03.160
the famous mathematician and logician

33:03.160 --> 33:04.920
in a book that he wrote in the 30s.

33:04.920 --> 33:06.860
And I'll read the quote to you.

33:06.940 --> 33:09.220
Above all, he, the student,

33:09.220 --> 33:11.900
must reject the definition still sometimes given

33:11.900 --> 33:15.580
of the quantity minus A, that it is less than nothing.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.420
It is astonishing that the human intellect

33:18.420 --> 33:20.940
should ever have tolerated such an absurdity

33:20.940 --> 33:23.620
as the idea of a quantity less than nothing.

33:23.620 --> 33:26.620
Above all, that the notion should have outlived the beliefs

33:26.620 --> 33:29.580
in judicial astrology and the nonexistence of witches,

33:29.580 --> 33:33.180
either of which is 10,000 times more possible.

33:33.300 --> 33:37.900
So as late as like the 1800s,

33:37.900 --> 33:39.820
negative numbers were still considered

33:39.820 --> 33:42.300
like an absurd idea by some.

33:43.460 --> 33:47.140
And it might be the case that negative probabilities

33:49.060 --> 33:51.540
will in the future be considered the same

33:51.540 --> 33:53.380
as we consider negative numbers,

33:53.380 --> 33:56.500
something just natural, like natural numbers are

33:56.500 --> 33:58.780
as a bookkeeping device.

33:58.780 --> 34:02.380
So just to summarize what I talked today,

34:03.580 --> 34:06.620
as we discussed, contextuality is a key characteristic

34:06.620 --> 34:07.860
of quantum properties.

34:09.300 --> 34:13.220
We often use hybrid space formalism to describe

34:13.220 --> 34:16.460
those quantum properties and the hybrid space formalism

34:16.460 --> 34:18.700
has built in that contextuality.

34:20.420 --> 34:25.420
That contextuality cannot be represented

34:25.460 --> 34:27.900
in probability theory unless you do something

34:27.900 --> 34:31.140
like for example, the approach of contextuality by default

34:31.180 --> 34:34.060
by increasing the number of random variables.

34:34.060 --> 34:36.620
But that goes against a little bit the idea

34:36.620 --> 34:41.620
that we do in physics because we have the same measurement

34:45.300 --> 34:47.180
apparatus for some of those things.

34:48.980 --> 34:52.620
But extended probability theories can be constructed.

34:52.620 --> 34:55.740
And here we just presented a measure theoretic framework

34:55.740 --> 34:57.980
for defining an extended probability

34:57.980 --> 35:02.980
that we feel captures at least the gist

35:03.660 --> 35:06.980
of quantum contextuality in the sense that we can model

35:06.980 --> 35:10.780
quantum contextuality with that probability theory.

35:10.780 --> 35:12.620
And we hope that such tool may be used

35:12.620 --> 35:13.980
when describing quantum phenomena.

35:13.980 --> 35:16.700
Like for example, we know that it implies

35:16.700 --> 35:20.420
the no signaling condition, which is part of quantum systems.

35:20.420 --> 35:24.820
But it's still unclear whether it's useful or not.

35:24.820 --> 35:29.820
So I just wanna end with acknowledging my collaborators.

35:33.780 --> 35:37.340
What I talked today is in essence part of a paper

35:37.340 --> 35:40.580
that I did with Federico Halleck

35:40.580 --> 35:43.060
who's organizing this conference.

35:43.060 --> 35:45.180
But I also benefited from a lot of discussions

35:45.180 --> 35:49.380
of many people in particular, those people listed here.

35:49.380 --> 35:50.700
So thank you.

35:51.540 --> 35:54.300
Okay, thank you, Jose, for your talk.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.660
There are some questions in the chat.

35:56.660 --> 35:59.900
The first one is from Shansen.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.820
All right, thank you for that talk.

36:06.820 --> 36:09.460
My question is about, has to do with sort of rhetoric

36:09.460 --> 36:10.460
and pedagogy.

36:10.460 --> 36:14.940
So, you know, like we, it sounds like we think very much

36:14.940 --> 36:17.500
the same way about quantum mechanics is basically

36:18.380 --> 36:23.060
like a new framework for handling probabilities.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.900
And I wonder whether it's the smartest strategy

36:26.900 --> 36:29.100
to convince people of our view

36:29.100 --> 36:31.740
that you now like have to like get used to the idea

36:31.740 --> 36:32.860
of negative probabilities.

36:32.860 --> 36:34.260
I mean, if you start, I mean,

36:34.260 --> 36:36.620
you're very nicely laid out the difference.

36:36.620 --> 36:38.380
Like, you know, you have contextuality, right?

36:38.380 --> 36:41.780
You don't, but quantum mechanics doesn't allow you

36:41.780 --> 36:43.340
to have joint probabilities, right?

36:43.340 --> 36:46.980
You can't assign values to all the different variables.

36:46.980 --> 36:51.100
I wonder if there isn't like sort of a more natural way

36:51.100 --> 36:54.980
of like ramming that down people's throats

36:54.980 --> 36:57.020
than going this route of introducing

36:57.020 --> 36:58.300
negative probabilities.

36:59.420 --> 37:00.900
Yeah, thank you.

37:00.900 --> 37:04.700
I confess that I would probably never teach

37:04.700 --> 37:06.980
negative probabilities to my students.

37:08.340 --> 37:11.860
Well, never, I mean, maybe in the future.

37:11.860 --> 37:14.220
That's not the reason why I'm talking

37:14.220 --> 37:15.860
about negative probabilities actually.

37:15.940 --> 37:18.140
The reason why I'm talking about negative probabilities

37:18.140 --> 37:23.140
is because I hope that by trying to understand

37:24.660 --> 37:27.500
certain phenomena in terms of negative probabilities,

37:27.500 --> 37:30.820
we might be able to get different insights

37:30.820 --> 37:33.260
into those phenomena that we would not get

37:33.260 --> 37:35.860
from the Hebert space formalism.

37:35.860 --> 37:39.500
I can give you a specific example, right?

37:39.500 --> 37:44.500
So when we look at different principles

37:45.980 --> 37:49.220
that define quantum mechanics that people have tried,

37:49.220 --> 37:54.060
like for example, Cabello have tried to define some principles

37:54.060 --> 37:55.940
that give us quantum mechanics.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.860
When you write them down in terms of negative probabilities,

37:59.860 --> 38:00.980
they become clear.

38:02.340 --> 38:05.700
Whether that's a useful tool for us to understand

38:05.700 --> 38:08.140
what's going on with quantum mechanics or not,

38:08.140 --> 38:11.540
I don't know because I didn't get any special insights

38:11.540 --> 38:13.060
from that, but that's my hope, right?

38:13.060 --> 38:14.740
That's what I'm trying to do.

38:14.740 --> 38:17.540
I'm trying to see if we can understand

38:17.540 --> 38:19.940
different types of quantum puzzles

38:19.940 --> 38:21.420
in terms of negative probabilities

38:21.420 --> 38:24.020
such that we can get better insight from them.

38:24.020 --> 38:27.220
If we do, then perhaps in the future,

38:27.220 --> 38:29.700
we might even try to teach our students that,

38:29.700 --> 38:31.340
but we're not there yet.

38:32.700 --> 38:33.540
Okay, thank you.

38:35.660 --> 38:40.660
And there is another question from Alison Decini.

38:41.700 --> 38:43.580
Hi, can you hear me?

38:43.580 --> 38:45.260
Yes, I can hear you.

38:45.260 --> 38:47.700
Okay, so thanks for the very nice question.

38:48.980 --> 38:51.340
My question is about Cauchy-Speccher theorem.

38:51.340 --> 38:54.780
So how do you avoid Cauchy-Speccher theorem

38:54.780 --> 38:56.300
in this kind of framework?

38:56.300 --> 38:58.940
Because Cauchy-Speccher theorem

38:58.940 --> 39:01.860
rule out the existence of evaluations.

39:01.860 --> 39:05.220
And if we represent all measurements

39:05.220 --> 39:07.220
as random variables in the same,

39:07.220 --> 39:09.020
sharing the same sample space,

39:09.020 --> 39:12.540
a point of the sample space would be evaluation.

39:12.580 --> 39:17.580
So how can you avoid Cauchy-Speccher theorem

39:19.420 --> 39:20.820
within this approach?

39:20.820 --> 39:22.060
That's my question.

39:24.220 --> 39:27.420
If I understand your question correctly,

39:27.420 --> 39:31.620
you're asking how I avoid Cauchy-Speccher and we don't.

39:31.620 --> 39:36.620
Let me go back to the GHZ case,

39:38.060 --> 39:40.940
which is a, so the difference

39:40.940 --> 39:42.460
between GHZ and Cauchy-Speccher

39:42.460 --> 39:45.780
that GHZ is for a specific state

39:45.780 --> 39:48.420
and Cauchy-Speccher is for any state, right?

39:48.420 --> 39:53.420
It's about the algebra of quantum observables.

39:54.660 --> 39:57.620
But you could think of Cauchy-Speccher

39:57.620 --> 40:02.620
as a series of measurements that prepare a state

40:02.620 --> 40:05.420
and then later on you get a contradiction.

40:05.420 --> 40:07.780
That's a different way to think about Cauchy-Speccher,

40:07.780 --> 40:10.900
but it's all there together.

40:10.900 --> 40:15.900
But this is the GHZ also has a contradiction, right?

40:16.220 --> 40:18.940
And the contradiction comes here

40:18.940 --> 40:21.660
from this guy in the bottom.

40:21.660 --> 40:24.580
This first parenthesis being one times one times one

40:24.580 --> 40:26.340
being equal to minus one.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.460
It's the same type of contradiction

40:28.460 --> 40:30.980
that you get on Cauchy-Speccher.

40:30.980 --> 40:34.380
And you are using random variables

40:34.380 --> 40:38.940
because each one of them individually are random.

40:38.940 --> 40:42.260
But if you look at each one of those products,

40:42.260 --> 40:45.220
if you thought of them as an individual random variable,

40:45.220 --> 40:47.420
let's say we call this product A,

40:47.420 --> 40:50.980
we call this product B and we call this product C.

40:50.980 --> 40:55.300
What we have is that A times B times C is equal to D.

40:56.900 --> 41:00.860
But this is what quantum mechanics tells us,

41:00.860 --> 41:03.140
but A is equal to one, B is equal to one

41:03.140 --> 41:05.900
and C is equal to one whereas D is equal to minus one.

41:05.900 --> 41:07.300
That's the contradiction.

41:07.300 --> 41:09.620
And the random variables that we have here

41:09.620 --> 41:11.680
are deterministic random variables.

41:12.900 --> 41:16.580
So I don't know if I'm answering your question

41:16.580 --> 41:18.460
the way you thought about it,

41:18.460 --> 41:21.260
but what I'm saying is we're not avoiding it.

41:21.260 --> 41:23.780
We have the contradictions there,

41:23.780 --> 41:25.820
but the contradictions come

41:25.820 --> 41:27.580
from the assumptions of Cauchy-Speccher.

41:27.580 --> 41:29.460
And the assumption of Cauchy-Speccher

41:29.460 --> 41:33.980
is that this guy here, say Y2 in this context

41:33.980 --> 41:36.780
is the same as the Y2 in this context.

41:36.780 --> 41:39.220
And when we use negative probabilities,

41:39.220 --> 41:42.140
that assumption is not true anymore

41:42.140 --> 41:44.780
because negative probabilities

41:44.780 --> 41:47.480
are washing out those requirements

41:47.480 --> 41:51.080
of how is it that those random variables are related.

41:52.380 --> 41:55.740
And then what you're asking about,

41:56.700 --> 41:59.060
if you were to ask me how exactly

41:59.060 --> 42:00.500
they are washing out those requirements,

42:00.500 --> 42:02.860
I would tell, wow, I don't know.

42:02.860 --> 42:06.220
That's how we book keep those probabilities.

42:06.220 --> 42:08.100
If you wanna know how they are doing that,

42:08.100 --> 42:10.260
then you would need to go to an interpretation

42:10.260 --> 42:13.220
that is not a purely epistemic interpretation

42:13.220 --> 42:14.300
as in bookkeeping.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.700
And there's nothing that forbids you from doing that, right?

42:20.380 --> 42:21.900
Does that make sense, what I'm saying?

42:21.900 --> 42:25.140
Or am I being confused here, confusing?

42:25.140 --> 42:27.900
Yeah, yeah, no, it makes sense.

42:27.900 --> 42:29.220
Thanks, thank you.

42:31.820 --> 42:34.780
Okay, we are done of the break.

42:34.780 --> 42:38.120
So, but there is one more question.

42:40.060 --> 42:41.260
It is very fast.

42:41.260 --> 42:44.900
So perhaps I can make it, if it's okay with you.

42:44.900 --> 42:48.100
So it is just about the notion of contextuality

42:48.100 --> 42:49.940
that you seem to be using.

42:51.140 --> 42:52.900
I'm just curious if you are familiar

42:52.900 --> 42:56.540
with the work of Speckens and this idea

42:56.540 --> 42:59.340
of using a different definition of contextuality

42:59.340 --> 43:03.140
than the one that seems to be used in Gohan Specker

43:03.140 --> 43:07.420
and in Bell's proof of non-contextuality.

43:08.420 --> 43:11.980
And if that makes a difference in the kind of project

43:11.980 --> 43:16.980
that you are using to accommodate all of contextuality

43:17.860 --> 43:19.940
using negative probabilities.

43:21.340 --> 43:24.060
Yeah, that's a good question.

43:26.620 --> 43:30.580
One could give a whole talk about like different ways

43:30.580 --> 43:32.860
of thinking about contextuality, right?

43:32.860 --> 43:35.900
So I've been very casual about talking

43:35.900 --> 43:39.820
about contextuality here and very specific about it.

43:39.820 --> 43:44.700
But it's unclear exactly how those different notions

43:44.700 --> 43:47.660
of contextuality relate to each other.

43:47.660 --> 43:50.780
Sometimes, not all the time, right?

43:50.780 --> 43:55.780
And to be very precise, one would need to prove

43:59.220 --> 44:02.380
what is the relationship between one definition

44:02.380 --> 44:05.900
of contextuality and another definition of contextuality.

44:05.900 --> 44:09.300
And as far as I know, that has not been done

44:09.300 --> 44:11.620
for all notions of contextuality.

44:11.620 --> 44:14.420
But there is this intuition that they kind of like

44:14.420 --> 44:16.580
are talking about the same thing.

44:16.580 --> 44:18.260
Because at the end of the day,

44:18.260 --> 44:22.060
they're all about commasurable properties

44:22.060 --> 44:24.300
and how those commasurable properties

44:24.300 --> 44:29.060
somehow are related to not having a possibility

44:29.100 --> 44:32.420
of talking about all of those properties at the same time,

44:33.980 --> 44:36.020
in terms of the intuition behind them.

44:38.660 --> 44:40.100
I know I'm not answering your question

44:40.100 --> 44:42.220
and the reason why I'm not answering your question

44:42.220 --> 44:43.940
is because I'm trying to say that I don't think

44:43.940 --> 44:48.100
there is a very clear answer to that question yet.

44:48.100 --> 44:51.020
But we hope that once we give a definition

44:51.020 --> 44:53.460
that's a measure theoretic definition,

44:53.460 --> 44:56.220
that precise definition of negative probabilities

44:56.220 --> 45:01.020
that correspond to also a definition of contextuality

45:01.020 --> 45:05.220
in that setup, that you can use that to prove theorems

45:05.220 --> 45:08.860
about how those things are related.

45:08.860 --> 45:12.300
It might be really, really interesting to explore that

45:12.300 --> 45:15.660
for two reasons, because the kind of definition

45:15.660 --> 45:18.580
that the Speckens uses makes no explicit reference

45:18.580 --> 45:21.700
to the idea of measuring two things at the same time.

45:21.700 --> 45:25.820
It is kind of different to the general idea.

45:25.820 --> 45:28.620
And two, because in the original paper,

45:28.620 --> 45:30.780
I think that that's from 25,

45:30.780 --> 45:33.900
he has a small derivation of showing that

45:33.900 --> 45:37.500
from his definition, you can derive the traditional one,

45:37.500 --> 45:39.820
the one that the Cohen Speckens used.

45:39.820 --> 45:44.380
So there must be a connection.

45:44.380 --> 45:47.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

45:49.100 --> 45:51.260
All those things are related,

45:51.260 --> 45:55.500
but how exactly they are related, it's not.

45:56.260 --> 45:58.860
Intuitively, yes, they should be related,

45:58.860 --> 46:01.300
but it's one thing to think that they should be related

46:01.300 --> 46:03.740
intuitively and to prove that they're related.

46:03.740 --> 46:05.820
So that's what I was trying to say.

46:08.540 --> 46:13.100
Thank you, Jose, and the people who have questions

46:13.100 --> 46:15.740
would have some minutes to go to the bathroom

46:15.740 --> 46:17.220
or take a coffee.

46:17.220 --> 46:18.060
We will back.
