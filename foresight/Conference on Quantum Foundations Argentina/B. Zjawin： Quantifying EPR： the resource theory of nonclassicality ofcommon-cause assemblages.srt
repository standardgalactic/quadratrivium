1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:08,320
Yes. Okay, great. So, yeah, let me start by thanking the organizers

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,880
for the opportunity to present my work. It's actually the first time that I'm attending

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,160
this conference and I must say that I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed a lot of talks for the

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:26,080
past three days. So thank you for having me here. My name is Bata Ziawin and I'm a PhD student at

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,440
the International Center for Fury of Quantum Technologies at the University of Gdańsk in

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,040
Poland. And we have a Quantum Foundations group here. The leader of the group is Anna

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,200
Bellin-Sainz and as you can see she's also a collaborator on this work as well as David

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,920
Schmidt and Mati Homan. So today I will talk about quantifying EPR, the Resource Fury of

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:59,040
Non-Classicality of Common Cause Assemblages. We recently put this draft on our archive so

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,440
if you find what I will be talking about interesting you can of course ask me questions

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,720
but I also encourage you to look at the paper. Okay, so let me start with a question.

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,200
Is quantum steering spooky action at a distance? Because it is sometimes called this way. So the

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,800
steering phenomena is a form of non-classical correlations that arise when one considers

14
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,360
measurements performed on half of a bipartite system prepared on an entangled state. So if we

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,080
try to represent the situation graphically we end up with a picture like this. Here the double lines

16
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,600
correspond to quantum systems and single lines correspond to classical systems. So we have

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,200
we have two parties, we have Alice and we have Bob and they share entangled states. Alice prepares

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,280
measurement on it so this represents a measurement device that takes a classical input x and outputs

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:06,000
classical variable a and now depending on x and a on Alice's side Bob's system can be described

20
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:14,080
by this conditional quantum state row a given x. So why is it sometimes called spooky action at a

21
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,600
distance? Well it is because Alice and Bob are two space-like separated parties but it seems that

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:29,440
Alice can somehow steer Bob's system into this conditional state. So the term steering was

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,800
actually given by Schrodinger himself and he called it that because from this scenario it kind

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,480
of seems that maybe Alice has an influence on what's happening in Bob's laboratory. But this is

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,760
not the only perspective that we can take when we talk about this scenario and a different one was

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:57,600
endorsed actually by EPR themselves so by Einstein Podolski and Rosen in their original work and it

27
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,160
is that simply Alice updates her knowledge of the state of Bob's system by performing a measurement

28
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,760
on a system correlated with his and of course it makes perfect sense that Alice and Bob shared

29
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,360
a correlated system so when Alice learned something about it she also updates her knowledge on what's

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,840
happening in Bob's laboratory. So is steering spooky action at a distance? Well not really it's

31
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,800
neither spooky or action at a distance and because of this throughout this presentation I will not

32
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:36,240
refer to this phenomenon as steering but simply as EPR scenario where again EPR stands for Einstein

33
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,160
Podolski and Rosen. So well we could say that it's just a change of name and maybe from a technical

34
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,280
perspective well it doesn't make much difference but from the foundational perspective it actually

35
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,680
makes a huge difference how we look at this scenario. So let me just recap everything that

36
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,000
I just said so from Schrödinger point of view he called this phenomenon quantum steering

37
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,560
in a sense that quantum because he thought that quantum state is a physical property of a system

38
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,800
and then the fact that Alice steers Bob means that there is some kind of supergluminar causal

39
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,200
influence. So in the modern language we would call a set of beliefs that see ontic view which basically

40
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,240
means that this quantum states describe distinct physical states of the world. While what EPR

41
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,280
interpreted it as they said well spooky action at a distance is not really acceptable so quantum

42
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,200
state we can take it to be a representation of one's information about the system and then in

43
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,680
this scenario Alice simply learns about true state of Bob's system and this point of view

44
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:58,720
could be described in the modern language as epistering sorry which is basically that quantum

45
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,320
states represent states of knowledge about the world. Okay so after this foundational

46
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,800
motivation let me go into the actual resource theory. Okay so we will talk about EPR scenarios

47
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,880
and what we take to be the defining features of an EPR scenario are the following. First

48
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,400
common cause causal structure so as I said we have two parties Alice and Bob and they share a

49
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,400
common cause which in this case is quantum and the second defining feature of this scenario are

50
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,360
types of systems that parties have access to so on Alice's side it will be a classical input

51
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,160
and a classical output while on Bob's side it will be a trivial input because he has no input at all

52
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:55,200
and a quantum output. And it's very usual to describe EPR scenarios with quantum assemblages

53
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:02,880
so a quantum assemblages assemblage is an object like this where each conditional state

54
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,840
contains information about what's going on on Alice's side so this probability distribution of

55
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:16,400
obtaining an outcome A given an input X and what's happening on Bob's laboratory so this conditional state.

56
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Okay so we want to create a resource theory of assemblages. Resource theories allow one to

57
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,600
formally quantify physical resources so in our case the resources are assemblages and what we

58
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,840
want to quantify is their non-classic quality. The structure of a resource theory is completely

59
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,120
determined by the set of three operations so three operations are operations that cannot

60
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,480
create a resourceful object and because of this they can also be applied to different resources

61
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,640
for free because if we apply a free operation to the resource it will not increase the resourcefulness

62
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:02,160
of it. And now for the case of assemblages our upload follows the recent developments of resource

63
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,320
theories for studying non-classicality of common cost processes wherein the three operations are

64
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,960
local operations and shared randomness so as I said an EPR scenario is simply a common cost

65
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,040
process and because of this we take a lesson from some papers that were already published

66
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,120
common cost processes are studied with LOSR operations and in particular there is this

67
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,800
paper here that basically creates a new branch of entanglement LOSR entanglement in contrast

68
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,960
to LOCC entanglement where CC stands for classical communication and that people usually talk about

69
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,360
and in this paper it is shown that taking this LOSR perspective actually resolves some anomalies

70
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:57,120
of entanglement and there is also this paper here which treats common cost boxes so things like

71
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,560
Bell's scenario where we have a common cost structure again but here both parties just

72
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,280
have access to classical inputs and classical outputs and because we can study both entanglement

73
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,200
and bell types scenarios using LOSR it means that we can also study their interplay which is really

74
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,040
amazing because it means that we can have like one unified resource theory of common cost processes

75
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,440
with different types of resources like entanglement bell boxes or assemblages and we can study

76
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,560
their relative non-classicality. I would also recommend this paper if you are interested in

77
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,400
this stuff because it talks about a type independent resource theory which considers even more types

78
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:48,160
than just entanglement assemblages and bell boxes. In the literature it was pretty well

79
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:56,640
motivated to study LOSR for common cost processes but even from simply looking at the DPR scenario

80
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,880
well we can see that it is a common cost process so we have two parties it's perfectly fine to

81
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,640
allow local operations for each of the parties local operations can be classical or quantum

82
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,120
it there will be quantum on both side and because we want to study the non-classicality

83
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,080
of assemblages we do allow classical common causes for free so what you can see on this picture here

84
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,560
on the right is an assemblage where the common cost is classical so Alice gets a classical

85
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,160
variable lambda and she performs her measurement while Bob prepares a quantum state depending

86
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:44,640
on the value of the classical variable and we call such assemblage a free assemblage because it

87
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,040
can be created solely by free operations so LOSR operations and it can be decomposed like this

88
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,920
so on Alice's side we just have this probability distribution where lambda is the short variable

89
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:05,520
and on Bob's side he prepares this quantum state. So for now I'll just mention that there are also

90
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:12,080
different approaches to studying non-classicality of assemblages and there is one resource theory

91
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,240
that was developed a few years ago that the set of the free operations in this resource theory

92
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,480
was the hasty one-way classical communication and local operations and after I'll introduce

93
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,600
our approach the LOSR one I will compare it to the previous one but I'll do it later on in my

94
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,640
presentation. Okay so what are these LOSR operations here in black we have the original

95
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,360
assemblage and now the most general LOSR operation that we can perform on it as first analysis side

96
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,960
we have a classical prep processing of this classical variable we have a classical post

97
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:58,560
processing of the output variable on Bob's side we have this post processing of his quantum state

98
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:07,600
so this will be just a CPTP map and now the actions of of local operations on Alice's side

99
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,840
and the local operation on Bob's side can be correlated by shared randomness so classical

100
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:22,080
common cause so this will be the lambda that's distributed to Alice and to Bob. Okay so now that

101
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,520
we have a resource theory and we have the set of free operations we can study the properties of the

102
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,080
preorder so we can study the relative non-classicality of assemblages and what we showed is that

103
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:41,200
assemblage conversion under LOSR can be tested using a single instance of a semi-definite program

104
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,360
so one assemblage is said to be more non-classical than another if it can be fairly converted to

105
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,280
the latter so if we have the black assemblage and we can convert it into a different one the one

106
00:11:53,280 --> 00:12:00,880
with primes with free operations well it means that they can be used for example for the same task

107
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,640
because they have this one will be at least as non-classical as this one

108
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,880
so we showed that checking such conversions can be tested by checking if the following program is

109
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,040
feasible so I have the semi-definite program here but maybe let me not go into details about it

110
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,800
if any of you is like interested in the details I can just we can talk about it later doing the

111
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,280
questions but the important lesson here is that how this program works is that you just input

112
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,880
two assemblages and it tells you what there one can be converted into the other and it works really

113
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,480
fast it's just a single instance so it's really amazing because it's a great tool to study the

114
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,280
relative non-classicality of assemblages and we use this to study the structure of the preorder

115
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:59,200
and one interesting result that we found is an infinite family of incomparable resources so resources

116
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,320
that none of them can be converted into any other and this family goes like as follows so what we

117
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,240
checked is that we had in scenario where we have Alice and Bob and they shared this state here so

118
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,360
they share a partially entangled state now Alice performs sigma z and sigma x measurements on it

119
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,280
so such an assemblage would be described like this so Alice performs this measurement Bob does

120
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:31,360
nothing and they share this partially entangled state but now something else that we allow is

121
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,640
mixing with noise so the assemblage that we study is defined here so it's parameter parameter

122
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,320
randomized by these two parameters theta and p where theta corresponds to this theta here in

123
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:53,520
the partially entangled states and p corresponds to the level of mixing with noise so you can see

124
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:00,160
here that with some probability we create this element of the assemblage and then we mix it with

125
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,520
noise and now the results of the program that I just showed you are presented in this graph here

126
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:14,480
so here each dot corresponds to one assemblage so for example this one is an assemblage created

127
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,480
where Alice and Bob share a state with theta being equal to pi over four so it's a so-called

128
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,440
maximally entangled state and they don't mix it with noise because p is equal to one and now the

129
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,840
arrow from here to here means that under LOS operations we can covert this assemblage to this

130
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,120
one where this one is when Alice and Bob share a state with theta being equal to pi over 12

131
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,680
and they mix it with noise with this p being equal to 0.9 so as you can see we can like

132
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,040
using the sdp we can check whether different converters are possible but one interesting

133
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,280
property that we can see here is in this family here so for p being equal one for different

134
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:07,440
values of theta no conversions are possible and we actually we checked it analytically

135
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,320
and we showed that this is the family of incomparable resources so for all values of theta

136
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,840
from 0 to pi over 4 so like up to a so-called maximally entangled state all of these assemblages

137
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:27,200
for p being equal to 1 are incomparable and yeah we also developed some new epr monotone

138
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:34,320
in order to confirm this result analytically. Okay as I promised I'll now compare it to prior

139
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,400
work which was a resource theory of so-called steering under so-hastical collaborations and

140
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,600
one way classical communication from Bob to Alice so this set of free operations is of course a

141
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,160
valid set of free operations for epr scenarios which means that it cannot create a resourceful

142
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,320
object and it goes as here so again in black we have the original assemblage and in green

143
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:07,280
we have the free operation so here Bob has an instrument that he performs on his part of the

144
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:13,920
state and as an output he gets first of all the classical variable that he sends to Alice

145
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:21,120
and also his quantum state and now Alice has a classical pre-processing of her variable that

146
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,640
depends on the message that she received from Bob and she also has a post-processing

147
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,920
so the motivation behind the set of free operations was that the authors claim that

148
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:43,040
is the most general set of free operations that does not compromise the security of one sided

149
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:50,320
device independent quantum key distribution protocols for them steering as a useful resource.

150
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,640
So the motivation here is a particular protocol in quantum information.

151
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,960
Okay so if you want to compare it to our work to LOSR approach the first thing that we can show

152
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:09,200
is a pretty big difference so the two resource theories actually have different pre-orders

153
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,800
which means that if we have a set of assemblages and we want to study it and we will study it with

154
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,400
two different approaches this one here and with our LOSR approach we can actually get

155
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:28,400
different results because the pre-orders are different. Now our LOSR approach has some conceptual

156
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,680
advantages over this one and one is that it has a clear physical motivation so motivation for

157
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,600
this approach here as one way LOSCC is this one sided device independent quantum key distribution

158
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:49,760
protocol while for our LOSR approach the the conceptual underpinning is more

159
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,360
foundational because it comes from the causal structure of this scenario and because of this

160
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,440
we have this unification of every type of non-classical correlation in bell-like scenarios

161
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,960
so we have a single LOSR resource theory for common cost scenarios and there are also some

162
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,640
technical advantages so for example our LOSR approach is simpler to characterize and study

163
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,280
this SDP this semi-different program is a good example that in our approaches it's really easy

164
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:29,040
to study the conversions and the other technical advantage is that our approach for the bipartite

165
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,120
scenario actually has some direct generalizations for example to multi-partite EPR scenarios but

166
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,400
also to bobov input and channel EPR scenarios where by channel EPR scenarios I mean something

167
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:50,480
that's usually referred to as channel steering and we left bobov input at channel for future work

168
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,680
but we did study the multi-partite scenarios so let me just say a few words about this right now

169
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,080
so let's go to a multi-partite setup which means that we now have more LSS for example this picture

170
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,680
here we have two LSS and as you can see everything just generalizes from the bipartite case so we still

171
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:15,360
have a common cost so we have the shared randomness that goes to each party and each party also can

172
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,480
perform local operations so we have local operations for Alice 1, Alice 2 and for Bob and what we

173
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,040
showed in the multi-partite scenario is that a sandwich conversion can be tested using a single

174
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,520
instance of a semi-definite program so we generalize the program that I showed you before

175
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,440
to to work for multi-partite scenarios and we also found a family of incomparable resources

176
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,520
so we have these two results that are very like they go in analogy to the bipartite case

177
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,680
but one thing that's a little bit extra here is a clear definition of a multi-partite free

178
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:02,960
assembled so again free assembled is one that can be can be created using only free operations

179
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,680
and since we study non-classicality the free assembled will be a classical assembled

180
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:14,000
or how people usually call it in the literature so an unsteerable assembled and actually there are a

181
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,360
lot of definitions of a free multi-partite assemblage in the literature the most general

182
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,680
that you will find is this one so it's that an assemblage is free if it can be decomposed

183
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,880
like this so we have this probability distribution for Alice's and we have the state for Bob

184
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,760
and actually in the most general definition there are no constraints on this probability

185
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,880
distribution here so for example this probability distribution is allowed to be signaling for each

186
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:51,200
lambda as long as the signaling average is out when we sum over all lambdas so such a thing is

187
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,760
usually referred to as fine tuning that we have this kind of undesired effect for for each lambda

188
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:06,320
but then it's average is out and it can be seen as problematic from some perspectives and there

189
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,760
are a few different problems that arise for this definition maybe I will not really go into detail

190
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:20,720
here but we don't have any of these problems in our LOSR approach so if we look at the set of

191
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:28,800
free operations again in our LOSR approach well it's pretty clear that a1 prime depends only

192
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:36,240
on x1 prime and lambda and a2 prime depends only on x2 prime and lambda so this probability

193
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,840
to distribution in our case will factorize so in our LOSR approach every assemblage is one

194
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,000
that decomposes like this so we don't really have any problems with signaling or any of the ones

195
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,800
that appear for this more general definition okay so that's pretty much it let me just make

196
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,880
some final remarks and so what I just presented to you was a resource theory of common cost

197
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:10,000
assemblages for bipartite and multi-partite EPR scenarios and it was motivated by a clear

198
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,320
causal interpretation of an EPR scenario that is a common cost that Alice and Bob share

199
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,800
thanks to this causal interpretation this notion is a unified notion of common cost resources

200
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,360
and it works for example for EPR scenarios but also for Bell scenarios and entanglement

201
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,560
we showed that testing convergence is numerically tractable which is very useful if you want to

202
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:46,240
study the preorder of resources and we use this result to show some interesting properties of

203
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,320
the preorder and finally in the multi-partite case we have a well-motivated definition of a free

204
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,960
multi-partite assemblage so thank you for your attention and I would be very glad to take any

205
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:10,800
questions okay thank you data for your talk now we have some minutes for questions or comments

206
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,440
if somebody makes a question please can you take this

207
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
can you check

208
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,040
yes um okay thank you and thank you for the talk I think it was very well

209
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:42,080
presented and I am a little confused about the general picture of what you're doing

210
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:50,560
um so okay let me try to state what I think is your project and let me relate it to some issues

211
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:58,480
that I that seem to be relevant okay so if I understand you correctly you first presented

212
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,360
the view of Schrodinger according to which there seems to be some type of action matter distance

213
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:13,360
in a typical EPR scenario and you said correctly that EPR themselves and in particular Einstein

214
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:20,000
had this view that well it might be that in reality quantum mechanics is not complete

215
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,840
and that the quantum state somehow reveals it's about the knowledge of Alice or Bob

216
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:35,520
okay that perhaps there is something more to the quantum state and in your case there seems

217
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:44,080
to be a reference to a common cause in the past of Alice's and Bob's labs okay and I just seem to

218
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:54,000
think that you can recover locality by this way of thinking and the problem I see is that well

219
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,960
that is precisely the starting point with Bell's work and with his theorem and his question was well

220
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:11,600
can we recover locality by doing something like whatever Einstein thought and his theorem is uh

221
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:19,760
no you cannot do it you cannot have a local theory and here's why because any theory that

222
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,520
that is uh non-local in this sense is going to make this uh inequalities is going to satisfy

223
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,000
these inequalities we go we check uh time and again we we notice that the inequalities are

224
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,480
violated and the the consequence seems to be that well any non-local theory is not going to work

225
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:47,520
so so let me know what am I missing and how is your yeah so you're not really missing anything

226
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,000
so let me start with your bell comparison so this is a bell type experiment right we have

227
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,120
a common cause and we have two parties and they make measurements so now if this common cause is

228
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,600
classical just by studying this causal structure so the fact that you have a common cause and you

229
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,840
have inputs and outputs you can derive bell inequalities and now if the common cause is

230
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:20,640
classical you can just like the the upper bound on the chsh inequalities too if the common cause

231
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,600
is quantum it's two times the square root of two and if it is allowed to be anything more but

232
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,000
there is still non signaling between the parties we have the pr box right so it goes up to four now

233
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,880
it's the same with epr scenarios so if this is a classical common cause then the assembler is free

234
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,840
and it's classical so as you said it kind of recovers the locality in in this sense but if

235
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:57,280
it's quantum we get assemblages that cannot be explained that's with classical physics okay but

236
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,200
then you must somehow be violating one of the assumptions of bell theorem right you must be

237
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,760
violating settings independence either by postulating some sort of common cause between

238
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,800
the state of lambda the the common cause and the settings of Alice and Bob or you're assuming something

239
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:22,880
like retrocausal theory in which Alice's settings somehow influence the the state of the the system

240
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:30,480
the common cause so for example here you can like put a box and you can make Bob make the

241
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,920
measurement and then it will be just like a standard bell scenario right so one way of looking

242
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:46,080
at an assemblage would be to see whether if Bob makes a measurement we violate a bell inequality

243
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,920
and like you could do so with the shared state is entangled right but if it's classical then you

244
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:02,160
cannot so you have to draw this line between what's classical and what's non-classical and

245
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:11,680
both for bells scenarios and for EPR scenarios this line can be decided based on the nature of

246
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,720
the common cause so if a common cause is classical then you will not violate a bell inequality but

247
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,680
if it's quantum so with the shared entangled state then you will get some some quantumness in this

248
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:36,400
scenario. Thank you. Does it answer your question or I'm not quite sure? Perhaps we should let other

249
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:43,520
people make questions and perhaps another time we can continue. Okay thank you. There is another

250
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:57,280
question from Federico Farlic but we have Federico. Yes thanks Beata for this very nice talk I wanted

251
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:03,680
to ask you whether there is a simple explanation of why you have a pre-order and not a partial order

252
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:13,440
or even a lattice as it happens in other resource theories? Not really so one thing is

253
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:26,560
so the structure of the pre-order here is very much inherent to the structure of the pre-order

254
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,000
for LOSR entanglement so for example in LOCC entanglement what you have is that

255
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:39,360
the conversions between states with an as the value of fee targets smaller you can actually

256
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:47,200
convert the states into a different partially entangled states. In the LOSR entanglement it's

257
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,760
not the case so it's already in the LOSR entanglement that you have family of incomparable resources

258
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:02,080
so for the case of assemblages this case is it just translates from the states to assemblages.

259
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,320
Okay thanks.

260
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,200
Okay there is another question or

261
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:26,640
it's not we thanks to Beata again for the talk and the people to participate.
