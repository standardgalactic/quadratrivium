00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
So good morning in this second day of the conference of Quantum Foundations.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.520
So we have today the pleasure of the first talk by Omar Asenda,

00:11.520 --> 00:14.240
who is from Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba in Argentina.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.360
He will speak about the use of optimization methods for quantum mechanics problems.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.080
So for one, please, Omar.

00:22.560 --> 00:32.240
Okay, thank you. Mariela, welcome. Congratulations to all the organizers for, well, finally,

00:34.560 --> 00:45.440
that the 10th edition of this conference finally has, well, it's taking place.

00:46.400 --> 00:54.640
And thank you for the opportunity to address some colleagues in these times.

00:56.720 --> 01:03.680
Actually, I usually prepare too much material for the talk.

01:03.680 --> 01:07.600
So I have planned this talk in two parts.

01:08.320 --> 01:16.320
I don't know how I will use exactly the time, but depending on how much time

01:17.200 --> 01:26.080
how fast I can go, well, I will cover the transmission of quantum states and maybe

01:27.200 --> 01:33.520
something about field body problems, but mainly the talk is about the transmission of

01:34.240 --> 01:42.080
quantum states. Usually what this work is actually is not published yet.

01:43.120 --> 01:50.240
You can find it in the archive, but it's an ongoing collaboration with Paulo Serra and

01:50.240 --> 02:01.200
Alessandro Ferron. And well, we can start thinking what is exactly a quantum state

02:02.160 --> 02:11.280
transfer, what we can think a quantum channel is made of.

02:12.720 --> 02:23.200
15 years ago, talking about a change of quantum systems, replicas of

02:24.160 --> 02:32.640
a quantum system that are interacting between them and, well, that can be used as

02:34.160 --> 02:40.960
a wire to transmit information. Well, 15 years ago, this was a major dream. It was the

02:43.120 --> 02:51.280
realm of theoretical physics. Today, there are a lot of technical advances that made

02:52.240 --> 02:58.800
the transmission of quantum state possible in solar state implementation, that is

03:02.560 --> 03:09.920
the setting that many people think about. In quantum state implementations, for example,

03:10.720 --> 03:19.920
the wire that will transmit the quantum state will be, for example, a chain of quantum dots or

03:21.280 --> 03:31.600
a chain of superconducting qubits, etc. Ideally, the wire is used to

03:32.720 --> 03:40.640
transmit quantum information from a sender to a receiver. The sender ideally will

03:40.960 --> 03:50.080
prepare some quantum state, the information that they want to send. The channel

03:52.080 --> 04:03.120
should be initialized to a simple state, and the receiver will perform some

04:04.000 --> 04:15.040
measurements to retrieve the information that the sender sent to him. Obviously, this is

04:17.520 --> 04:25.200
a quite complicated problem if the Hamiltonian of the system is a many-bodied Hamiltonian,

04:25.760 --> 04:38.720
and the interactions are, well, long-range, etc. Most people think, usually, in very simple systems,

04:39.360 --> 04:47.920
in particular, many times the problem is not solved in the whole human space, so

04:48.080 --> 05:01.520
usually, the Hamiltonian has some symmetries that allow to restrict the dynamic of the problem

05:03.600 --> 05:14.640
to use a sub-space of the whole human space. There are many protocols. A protocol is

05:15.200 --> 05:30.080
a recipe to prepare the state, how the system evolves in time, and finally, how the information is

05:30.080 --> 05:43.600
retrieved at the other stream of the chain. Many people is familiarized with the X-axis Hamiltonian,

05:43.680 --> 05:51.760
that is a spin Hamiltonian that has only interaction, for example, in the plane,

05:52.800 --> 06:02.880
is an isotropic Hamiltonian. To fix the idea, many people think that the initial state is prepared

06:02.880 --> 06:11.440
in the first site of the channel. The rest of the chain is initialized in a simple state

06:12.240 --> 06:22.000
that, depending on the physics of the problem, is maybe the ground state of the system.

06:24.720 --> 06:34.640
The time evolution, obviously, is produced with some unitary time evolution operator,

06:34.640 --> 06:45.920
because, at least in principle, the simplest way to analyze these problems is using unitary

06:46.720 --> 06:55.520
time evolution. Obviously, it is possible to consider an open chain, an open quantum system,

06:55.520 --> 07:06.720
but the problem becomes almost intractable. At least if the length of the chain

07:08.320 --> 07:21.200
will be around the 10 spins or things like that. This is just to fix ideas. There are many forms,

07:21.200 --> 07:30.240
many protocols, but this is the simplest. An initial state, and in the simplest protocol,

07:30.240 --> 07:38.320
the time evolution is given by the autonomous Hamiltonian of the chain. There is no external

07:38.320 --> 07:51.600
forcing, so, actually, the time evolution is the simplest time evolution operator,

07:51.600 --> 08:01.520
is the exponential of the Hamiltonian. It is possible to use the spectral decomposition

08:01.520 --> 08:14.320
of the operator. A lot of things are easy to calculate. Even more, if this is the initial

08:14.320 --> 08:20.080
state and the Hamiltonian is for magnetic and the zero state is the random state,

08:21.120 --> 08:28.400
this Hamiltonian commutes with the total magnetization, so the dynamics keeps,

08:29.360 --> 08:41.120
is restricted to the one excitation subspace, so the dimension of the actual

08:42.480 --> 08:53.440
hillar space is basically the size of the chain. If the chain has n spins, then the dimension of

08:53.520 --> 09:01.360
the hillar space in the one excitation subspace, the dimension of the hillar space,

09:01.360 --> 09:16.640
the subspace is just n. Many times, the quantity that is used to quantify how good, how successful

09:17.600 --> 09:26.160
is the protocol, is called the fidelity, the transmission fidelity, that can be calculated

09:26.160 --> 09:35.920
regularly using the amplitude probability that an excitation is

09:38.800 --> 09:44.720
transferred from the first side of the chain to the last side of the chain. This quantity is

09:45.680 --> 09:52.480
quite easy to calculate in the sense that it's just an expectation value of the

09:54.480 --> 10:03.200
time evolution operator. This particular formula can be deduced because to

10:03.440 --> 10:17.440
quantify the channel, usually what is used is an average over all the initial state that can be

10:17.440 --> 10:29.440
prepared. Just to fix some ideas, many times, well, it is interesting to consider that the chain

10:30.000 --> 10:45.280
could be in a disorder state. The couplings maybe cannot be fixed to some desired value.

10:46.240 --> 10:55.840
Maybe there are defects in the fabrication process, or just like every

10:57.920 --> 11:07.840
non-standard system, it is quite difficult to fix all the couplings, etc. And this

11:08.800 --> 11:19.120
is, for example, how it is possible, for example, to control the time evolution of the problem.

11:19.120 --> 11:27.360
Sometimes it is useful just to consider that the transmission process is forced or controlled

11:27.360 --> 11:36.160
by applying some external control fractions. Why? Because many times, the natural time evolution,

11:36.160 --> 11:46.000
the autonomous time evolution is not sufficient to achieve a good transmission. Obviously,

11:46.000 --> 11:53.600
the idea is that if the fidelity reaches the unity, well, the transmission is perfect,

11:53.600 --> 12:07.840
all values of FT superior to 0.999 are considered interesting, but obviously,

12:08.960 --> 12:20.960
depending on the Hamiltonian, how these chain coupling coefficients are chosen, etc., this

12:21.040 --> 12:31.760
fidelity could be a fiber that is lower rather lower than the unit. So, it is useful sometimes to

12:31.760 --> 12:40.880
consider a forced evolution. But the problem of the forced evolution is obviously controlling

12:41.840 --> 12:51.920
a nanoscopic, a microscopic quantum system is quite difficult. Many times, it is impossible

12:51.920 --> 13:01.120
to control the system with smooth functions. There are a lot of considerations that can be

13:01.200 --> 13:11.120
made, advising against using a control evolution. Many times, it is the only option, because the

13:11.840 --> 13:23.520
interactions cannot be chosen, but are fixed for some fundamental interaction. But the force

13:24.480 --> 13:32.480
or the control evolution of a quantum system is quite difficult. In particular, if the system

13:33.520 --> 13:47.040
doesn't have a lot of symmetries or the dynamics cannot be kept in a sub-space,

13:47.760 --> 13:54.160
it is quite difficult to calculate this control evolution, because obviously,

13:56.000 --> 14:06.480
the control functions shall be obtained using an optimization method. So,

14:06.480 --> 14:17.360
anyway, for the excess Hamiltonian, people have been working in this area for many years.

14:17.360 --> 14:24.080
So, there are a lot of interesting results, like perfect quantum state transmission is achievable,

14:25.040 --> 14:36.400
choosing particular values for the quantities j, ji, or these quantities, choosing some very

14:36.400 --> 14:43.840
particular values. It is possible to achieve using autonomous time evolution. It is possible to

14:43.840 --> 14:52.880
achieve perfect quantum state transmission, basically for any initial state. Even more,

14:53.040 --> 15:05.520
it can be proved that the dynamics behaves like a specular inversion in the quantum chain. So,

15:05.520 --> 15:12.800
the thing that you prepare in the half of the chain will be reflected at some time in the other

15:12.800 --> 15:21.280
half of the chain. It is very interesting. There are regimes where a most perfect quantum state

15:21.280 --> 15:32.480
transmission can be achieved just using an almost homogeneous quantum state. All the coefficients,

15:32.480 --> 15:43.040
all the strange coefficients are equal, except a pair or maybe four exchange coupling coefficients

15:43.040 --> 15:50.880
will be chosen different, and a very good quantum state transmission can be achieved.

15:50.880 --> 16:03.920
So, why the XX Hamiltonian was studied so intensely? Why there are so many

16:04.480 --> 16:14.640
results? Basically, because of this fundamental fact, it's quite easy to go in the XX Hamiltonian

16:14.640 --> 16:28.880
from a given, I can choose the couplings and, well, I can calculate the, it is possible to

16:28.880 --> 16:37.840
calculate the spectrum of the system, or it is possible to prescribe the spectrum that I want

16:37.840 --> 16:46.080
to have for some Hamiltonian, and there is an unique way to calculate the exchange coupling

16:46.080 --> 16:55.440
distribution. All the exchange coupling distribution is, in this case, always in the case where

16:55.760 --> 17:06.400
we are dealing with the one excitation, some space, it's a one-to-one relationship, okay?

17:06.400 --> 17:12.560
I can provide, for example, a very simple spectrum, for example, I can choose that the

17:12.560 --> 17:24.880
spectrum of the system consists in eigenvalues that can be chosen, they are equal spaces between them,

17:25.440 --> 17:33.200
okay? That sounds like a system that is quite possible that the whole contribution from the

17:33.200 --> 17:43.040
eigenvalues cannot be constructed at some time, so I can choose this spectrum and the

17:44.320 --> 17:49.520
coefficients can be calculated one by one in a unique way.

17:50.080 --> 18:01.920
Obviously, most quantum spinchase doesn't have this property, in particular, the

18:01.920 --> 18:11.680
case in the Hamiltonian doesn't have this property. It is impossible to prescribe a spectrum,

18:12.400 --> 18:21.280
and in that way, obtain the coefficients that produce that spectrum, okay?

18:23.200 --> 18:35.200
Well, as anybody that has found sometimes the better answer to the relationship between the

18:35.200 --> 18:46.240
spectrum in the case in the Hamiltonian is, right, the obscure. Any way, well, or more precisely,

18:46.240 --> 18:58.080
because of this, many words focus in the control transmission in the case in the Hamiltonian,

18:58.800 --> 19:03.200
because, well, a lot of people thought that it was

19:05.920 --> 19:19.760
easier to control a quantum chain, a homogeneous quantum chain obeying the case in the Hamiltonian,

19:19.760 --> 19:29.200
and, well, controlling, designing very sophisticated control courses can be found that maybe the

19:29.200 --> 19:38.240
transmission time, the transmission in the time in which the receiver can retrieve the

19:38.240 --> 19:46.480
information sent by the sender, well, that time is around, obviously, if j is equal to 1,

19:47.040 --> 20:00.800
there are most no energy units, so it is natural to measure the transmission time in

20:03.440 --> 20:12.080
units of the length of the chain. That is the only, okay, if j is exactly equal to 1,

20:12.080 --> 20:25.200
this is a very good unit to measure the time. I didn't say it, but another interesting quantity

20:25.920 --> 20:35.520
or another interesting feature of the change with the excess Hamiltonian is that here,

20:35.520 --> 20:46.960
it is very easy to show that the transmission time, the transmission time that the receiver

20:47.600 --> 20:56.240
should weigh to measure and obtain a very good fidelity of transmission, that time is bounded,

20:57.120 --> 21:04.960
but by the time that is consistent with the quantum speed limit, so

21:07.600 --> 21:17.680
it is very easy to think that this Hamiltonian has a sound velocity for the spin waves and that

21:18.480 --> 21:27.920
spin and that velocity is related to the quantum speed limit. In the case in the Hamiltonian,

21:27.920 --> 21:38.640
there is no simple way to assess which is the time scale with convenience to measure or to

21:39.360 --> 21:55.840
try to produce a very good transmission. So, what can be done with all this? Well,

21:56.800 --> 22:04.640
actually, we said that this quantity, the probability that an excitation can be transmitted

22:04.640 --> 22:13.840
from the first side to the last side is a quantity that depends on the spectrum and on the sound

22:13.840 --> 22:21.840
coefficients of the eigenvalue, sorry, of the eigenvector, so this quantity can be optimized.

22:23.920 --> 22:34.320
I can think that this is a complicated function that depends, obviously, on all the coefficients

22:35.520 --> 22:48.560
that determine the Hamiltonian, so maybe I can choose somehow the exchange couplings and

22:49.600 --> 22:56.320
using that exchange coupling, I can calculate the spectrum, the eigenvalues and calculate this.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.560
So, if I can devise a method to explore

23:04.240 --> 23:19.200
all the large number of values of the z-coefficient, maybe I can find the largest value

23:20.000 --> 23:33.360
for this quantity, for some time that I can choose somehow. So, it is obvious that

23:35.680 --> 23:41.360
this function, the amplitude of probability that an excitation goes from the first side to the

23:41.360 --> 23:51.440
last side is a quantity that depends on all the coefficients. In a general change, there will be

23:51.440 --> 24:04.480
nj coefficients, n exchange coefficients, so for a change, for example, of 50 spins,

24:05.280 --> 24:19.840
it is a rather large space, a parameter space to explore. So, it is hopeless to try to

24:20.640 --> 24:32.880
investigate the whole space in a completely random way, a space of 50 dimensions is to be to explore,

24:32.880 --> 24:47.040
so maybe the exploration can be done using some kind of random walk, but it must be a

24:47.040 --> 24:55.120
directed random walk in the parameter space. Well, fortunately, there are a lot of

24:55.360 --> 25:05.520
methods, but the people in the statistical mechanics area have devised a lot of

25:07.600 --> 25:18.080
methods to explore a rather large parameter space, and one of these methods is the

25:18.640 --> 25:27.440
pivot methods that are used for global optimization. So, pivot methods are basically a good way to

25:27.440 --> 25:38.320
generate a random walk that explores, in an intelligent way, a given parameter space. Obviously,

25:38.400 --> 25:47.600
this is an example, an after-example of a search conducted over a two-dimensional parameter space.

25:48.320 --> 26:01.680
This is a typical chart flow that can be found in all the papers in pivot methods are paper from

26:01.680 --> 26:16.240
the 90s, so instead of using some colorful cartoons, it is most common to find chart flows like this,

26:16.240 --> 26:28.320
because chart flows are the way to express an algorithm. I don't want to enter, but I mean,

26:29.280 --> 26:38.000
any pivot method, any method can be used that is useful to search in a large

26:39.520 --> 26:46.960
parameter space, it can be used to perform exactly the same that we did. So, for example,

26:49.040 --> 26:55.760
you have 10 more minutes, so to finish everything. Thank you, thank you. Well,

26:55.920 --> 27:08.560
this is, for example, how can a search for the coefficient can be done. This is a short

27:10.080 --> 27:20.960
chain, but it is useful because the chains that are used are termed centrosymmetric because

27:21.040 --> 27:29.440
there are symmetry between the first exchange coefficient and the last, and the optimization

27:29.440 --> 27:39.440
method proceeds, the pivot method proceeds like by looking in a particular hyper queue

27:39.440 --> 27:45.520
that contains all the possible values of the exchange coefficients. The problem with the

27:45.520 --> 28:00.160
Heisenberg Hamiltonian has, there is not a simple way to bound the values of the

28:00.160 --> 28:10.560
exchange coefficient that I need to use to achieve the transmission for some time, because, again,

28:10.640 --> 28:20.000
the spectrum is quite complicated. We proceeded by looking at the best possible values of J that

28:20.000 --> 28:29.360
provided a very good, or the best, the best fidelity of transmission in a small hyper queue,

28:29.360 --> 28:40.320
but then we will, we proceed to enlarge the hyper queue and we go from some exchange

28:40.320 --> 28:50.000
capital distributions that are obtained using some particular transmission time,

28:50.640 --> 29:00.880
and this is what we found after a lot of numerical effort, but, effectively, we found

29:02.400 --> 29:12.320
very good, near-perfect quantum state transmission for spin chains of, basically,

29:13.280 --> 29:20.560
the length that we wanted, and for the arrival times of our chosen.

29:22.080 --> 29:32.400
So the pivot method is able to find the necessary exchange couplings to produce

29:33.040 --> 29:39.680
very good or near-perfect quantum state transmission in the Heisenberg Hamiltonian.

29:39.760 --> 29:52.480
That is a result that was not known previously, but obviously the way to look for this exchange

29:52.480 --> 30:04.240
coupling is clearly the result of a random walk that is performed, it's a direct random walk,

30:04.240 --> 30:13.200
but maybe we can think that, well, the probability of transmission is quite high,

30:13.200 --> 30:22.240
it's quite interesting, if you look at in this inset, all the transmission probabilities can be

30:23.120 --> 30:32.960
made, well, basically, are bigger than 0.999 if we want to

30:35.760 --> 30:46.400
that kind, that quality of transmission, but, obviously, once we get the exchange

30:46.400 --> 30:57.440
coupling distribution, we wanted to understand if the solutions, this solution, have some physics

30:58.720 --> 31:06.640
or are just results that the only thing that can be said about them is that they provide

31:06.640 --> 31:18.720
a very good quantum state transmission. So we looked for the probability of having a good

31:18.720 --> 31:28.640
transmission, this is a typical time evolution, near the transmission time, these are the peaks

31:28.640 --> 31:41.200
of the probability for different settings, we can design or use different arrival times,

31:41.200 --> 31:51.040
so, for example, these are very short arrival times, the black curves, the red curves correspond to a

31:51.040 --> 31:58.560
larger arrival time, the blue one a more larger arrival time, but

32:02.480 --> 32:09.120
each one of these was calculated with a different exchange coupling distribution, but, well,

32:10.080 --> 32:21.840
some of us have a strong background in scaling and that kind of property, so we scale the time

32:21.840 --> 32:29.120
evolution of the probability and we found that, basically, it doesn't matter what is the time,

32:29.120 --> 32:35.120
the arrival time, basically, the behavior around the arrival time is basically the same,

32:35.120 --> 32:48.800
which is a quite neat result because the exchange coefficients that are used to

32:50.240 --> 32:58.960
calculate the probability of arrival probability for a given time has nothing to do with

32:59.520 --> 33:09.280
the another exchange coupling distribution, so, for example, it is possible to,

33:13.040 --> 33:23.520
after some numerical experiments are done, it is possible to study what is the minimum size of

33:23.520 --> 33:32.560
their per queue necessary to find where this exchange coupling can be found, this is that size,

33:32.560 --> 33:43.440
for example, we can say that if we choose a larger arrival times, the strength of the

33:44.720 --> 33:50.640
exchange coupling distribution, the maximum value of the exchange coupling distribution,

33:50.720 --> 34:00.400
basically, decays in an exponential way, so, in a sense, we can say that for very large exchange,

34:01.600 --> 34:12.240
sorry, for very large arrival time, basically, the chain will be, well, basically almost

34:12.240 --> 34:18.480
homogeneous, but not exactly homogeneous, there is no need to have very different values

34:19.440 --> 34:36.320
between the exchange coupling distribution, and, well, another way to qualify how good

34:36.320 --> 34:44.080
are these exchange coupling distributions, for example, consider what the set of exchange

34:44.160 --> 34:54.880
couplings have been obtained, well, what about adding some disorder if, well, looking at this

34:56.800 --> 35:05.600
fiber is quite obvious that the probability, the transmission, the transfer,

35:06.560 --> 35:17.520
the probability that is related to fidelity can be made as large as close to the unity as wanted,

35:18.160 --> 35:34.080
but these values are stable if some disorder is produced, everything, maybe this transmission

35:34.080 --> 35:43.440
under some disorder is completely destroyed or not, well, we consider some static disorder

35:43.440 --> 35:53.520
applied to the chain, and we found that, well, the chain was able to sustain some disorder, so,

35:54.160 --> 36:06.480
the, in some sense, the maximum found by the pyramid is rated well, because applying some disorder

36:06.480 --> 36:18.880
can be thought like, well, making another stochastic search, another stochastic search around the

36:18.880 --> 36:30.480
values that the people met found, but basically, we can say that the spin distribution are, well,

36:31.520 --> 36:40.080
produced a very good, very, very good transmission, and that they are quite stable against

36:41.040 --> 36:51.040
this disorder, so, as I said, I prepare a lot of material, but the conclusion of this part is,

36:51.040 --> 37:06.240
we are almost in time, yeah, yeah, the conclusion, well, this, the physics near this new configuration,

37:06.320 --> 37:15.920
this new change, is quite inspired, we want to study the physics, how the transmission is produced

37:15.920 --> 37:27.440
in this change that has, that have the couplings, Tyler is specifically to produce a large,

37:28.400 --> 37:44.320
a large fidelity of transmission, well, as a stochastic search, everything works fine, but we

37:44.320 --> 37:52.960
don't know why, at least, well, in that moment, when we wrote the manuscript, we didn't have

37:53.920 --> 38:02.400
clues why everything works so fine, I think that we now have some clues that we are exploring them,

38:04.400 --> 38:12.240
this procedure will be successfully translated to another Hamiltonian, we are looking for that,

38:12.800 --> 38:27.200
maybe there are other procedures to determine these couplings in another way, maybe there are,

38:28.480 --> 38:37.200
because looking at the exchange couplings that are calculated, it is not obvious that they can be

38:37.280 --> 38:48.400
translated in a, in a, in a simple formula, we are discussing also if some experimental implementation

38:48.400 --> 38:56.240
can be made, well, and that's it, well, half a minute, okay, one minute and a half,

38:58.960 --> 39:05.840
thank you very much, thank you Omar, so if someone has a, just a short question,

39:06.800 --> 39:08.080
we can put it here,

39:19.680 --> 39:31.120
so you mean the, the, of elements in mind, you studied the, the left, the chain,

39:32.080 --> 39:36.720
and you did a search, sorry, you touched with the left, the chain, dependent on n?

39:39.920 --> 39:48.640
Sorry, the communication was interrupted, but I couldn't hear the question, can you repeat, sorry,

39:50.720 --> 39:55.120
if you did a search with the left, length of the chain, depending on the number n,

39:56.080 --> 40:02.160
just to short something, but you mean small, the size of the system, you're,

40:04.160 --> 40:19.600
no, we, we can study the chains from, from 10, 10 spins, 10 spins to 100, there is not an actual

40:20.320 --> 40:33.680
limit, we stopped in 100 because, well, we didn't want to, to, to wait for the, for the results,

40:33.680 --> 40:47.920
but there is not a practical limit, anyway, a chain of 100 sites is beyond, clearly it's beyond

40:47.920 --> 40:57.920
any practical implementation at least for, for a few next years, but there is no an upper bound,

40:58.960 --> 41:04.960
we stopped around 100, but we, for some new experiments, for some new results, we're

41:05.680 --> 41:14.480
maybe looking at 120, yeah. Thank you. So we don't have, we don't have any comments,

41:14.480 --> 41:23.680
so we thank again Nomar with a, with a clap, so we can change the vertical, thank you.

41:24.480 --> 41:32.800
Thank you organizers, I want to thank you again, congratulations to achieve the 10th

41:34.880 --> 41:41.440
conference and, and, and well, for a, for a very good acronym.
