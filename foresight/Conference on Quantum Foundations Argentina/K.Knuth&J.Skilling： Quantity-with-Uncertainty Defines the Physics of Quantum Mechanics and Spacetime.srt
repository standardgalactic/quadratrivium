00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,440
Okay, welcome to the session number two is now I have the pressure to present to Kevin

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:28,680
Nutt from the University of Albany. He will talk about quantity with uncertainty,

3
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,640
defines the basics of quantum mechanics and space.

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,760
All right, great. Thank you for having me. Hello, everyone. And yes, I'm doing this. This work has

5
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:53,000
been working on this with John Skilling from Ireland and so we'll dive right in as long as

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,960
everyone can see my screen here. So this work basically takes advantage of a slightly different

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:12,920
perspective of what we are doing in physics. Instead of thinking about the natural laws,

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,640
the laws of nature as being laws that are dictated by mother nature that we all have to obey,

9
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,360
we're looking at I'm looking at this from a perspective of

10
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:33,080
of people wanting to quantify things. And we've gotten so used to quantifying

11
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,920
things. And by that, I mean assigning numbers to things that we almost give it no second,

12
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:47,560
no additional thought. And of course, this is a very simple process. We learn to do this as

13
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,560
children. We assign numbers for different properties of objects. And the larger things are typically

14
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,000
assigned larger numbers. And of course, there's some arbitrariness here, there's some some choice

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,920
you can make. So here I have pictures of some batteries, 1.5 volt battery, a six volt battery,

16
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:13,240
a 12 volt battery. And so we are assigning numbers to one aspect of these, this set of batteries.

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:23,560
And classically, we tend to, because we're so familiar with this, we have come to

18
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:33,320
think of these quantities as being properties of the objects themselves. So, so in fact,

19
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,640
we even use them in the name. It's a, this is a 12 volt battery. And that's the

20
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,480
that number 12 is considered to be a property of the battery, which I, which I think is a very,

21
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:57,240
that's a little too strong. And you can start to see where this is going to be problematic when we

22
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,960
consider things like very small objects, where the probes that we're using to study them are

23
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,360
equally small. The assigned quantities in these cases really describe interactions rather than

24
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:23,480
describing properties of the objects. So we often, you know, our language often governs how we think

25
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,360
and how we think is described by our language. So these two things are coupled and very often

26
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,720
we'll hear people say or will, or will, I myself will say things like an electron has an energy E

27
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,680
or has a momentum P. And, and that's really not a good way to think about it. The electron can't

28
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,480
possess a momentum because the momentum of an, of an electron is really observer dependent.

29
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,200
You boost to another observer in a different frame and they'll measure a different momentum

30
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,040
for the object. They'll say this, no, this electron has this momentum P. And of course,

31
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,360
we know how these two numbers are related. But, but I think that one of the difficulties that

32
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:15,000
we've faced conceptually is, is taking these numbers that we're assigning as descriptions of,

33
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,520
of objects, descriptions of properties of objects, descriptions of the way that they're

34
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:28,920
interacting with observers and attributing them to being numbers describing properties of the

35
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:35,960
objects. And that I think that's really a wrong way of thinking and it's caused us a good bit of

36
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:43,080
trouble. The momentum and position and energy, these types of quantities really are describing

37
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,480
the relationship between the electron and the observer. And so momentum is one description

38
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,880
of the relationship position is a different description of that relationship. And the fact

39
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,120
that the two descriptions are incommensurate really isn't surprising or unusual. They're just

40
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,840
two different descriptions. And so there's been in quantum mechanics, historically, there's been a

41
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:19,880
lot of puzzlement over the fact that how can, how can an electron not have a definite position

42
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,680
and a definite momentum at any given time? Well, the fact is the electron doesn't have either.

43
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,040
Those are descriptions of the relationship between the electron and the observer. And you can't

44
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,600
have both of those descriptions can't hold at the same time. That's really what's going on there.

45
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:47,480
It's really only mysterious if you think of these quantities as properties. So we've worked hard to

46
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,920
give up these ideas of properties and thinking of this more in terms of description.

47
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:04,200
So contextuality, in this case, becomes a little less mysterious, the context of the, or the details

48
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:11,400
of the interaction matter. And, and of course, what you are going to, how you are going to describe

49
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:18,760
in interaction depends on the details of those interactions. And descriptions need not be

50
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:27,000
commensurate. You can have complementarity. The electron doesn't simultaneously possess a momentum

51
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,360
and a position the electron doesn't possess either. That's a bad way of thinking.

52
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,800
So, so what this does is it gives you a bit of freedom, which is, which is interesting. And, and

53
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:50,920
the profitability of such a perspective then is measured by what it allows you to do. And, and

54
00:06:51,480 --> 00:07:03,080
we've found that it allows you to, to actually do quite a bit. So if you're going to assign numbers to,

55
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,000
to objects or properties of objects or interactions between objects and, and probes,

56
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,560
or observers, then you need to do so consistently. And that's the question becomes,

57
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:28,920
how does one consistently assign quantities? So, so different operators may have different

58
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:35,720
frequencies and, or I'm sorry, may have different symmetries. And these symmetries

59
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,920
can be quite important because they will constrain the number of ways in which you can

60
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:49,720
assign numbers to things. So let's say I have two sets of candy taffy here. And I'm using candy

61
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,320
because what I'm going to be doing with these, these taffy is, is rather simple. You've all known

62
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:02,920
about this since you were kids. So I've got a set here A of some taffy and I've got a set B of some

63
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:09,320
taffy. And I'm going to combine the two. So let's say I've set A in one hand and set B on the other

64
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:19,240
hand and I'm going to put them together. Now, if I want to quantify these sets, basically assign

65
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:27,080
numbers to the, the, the sets of taffy, one way obvious way to do this that you're very familiar

66
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,040
with is to count them. We'll assign a number describing the cardinality of the set.

67
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:42,200
And one can then ask the question, well, how do you take the number that you assign to set A

68
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,880
and the number that you assign to set B? And how do you combine those numbers to arrive at the,

69
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,520
a consistent number that you're going to assign for set A with B? Of course, you all know the

70
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:04,520
answer to this already. You add them. And my interest in this question came from the deeper

71
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,040
question that I had in graduate school, which was, why, why do you add them? And I know that it works.

72
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,640
It's obvious that it works. I've been doing this since I was a kid. But why is that the case?

73
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,560
Can you prove that it has to be that way? And indeed you can.

74
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:29,720
There's several different properties that this with operator, basically combining stuff in two hands

75
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:39,400
exhibits this, this, this combination property with exhibits closure in this case. So if I take

76
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,240
stuff A and combine it with stuff B, the stuff that I have in A with B are the same kinds of

77
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,120
stuff. If I take taffy in my left hand and taffy my right hand and combine them, then I still have

78
00:09:50,120 --> 00:10:02,520
a bunch of taffy. So that's closure. Another symmetry that you have with this operator is the,

79
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,680
is commutivity. Doesn't matter which hand I have set A of taffy and which hand I use to pick up

80
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,720
the sets in the first place. I could switch hands and I still have the same result when I combine

81
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:23,560
them. That's a symmetry. If I have three piles of taffy and I start picking them up,

82
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,000
I can pick them up in various ways. And the result is equivalent. That's called associativity.

83
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:43,000
And the idea is that the with operator is such that I can keep grabbing piles of taffy if I want.

84
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,280
And so mathematically I ought to be able to keep combining them.

85
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,880
So these are the four conditions that the with operator has to satisfy.

86
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,280
You can prove, this is a theorem, you can prove that if the with operator satisfies

87
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:06,360
these four conditions. And you can think of associative commutivity as just shuffling.

88
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:14,200
I can shuffle up the piles and I get the same result. Then you can show that if you're going

89
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,360
to quantify the set A with a number representative of lowercase A, and you're going to quantify the

90
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:28,920
set B with a number given by lowercase B, then A with B is basically going to have to be quantified

91
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:36,520
by something that's isomorphic to A plus B. And that's a theorem. That's something you can prove.

92
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:43,400
So you might say great. That's something we've known this all along. Not very exciting. I've

93
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:49,960
known this since I was three years old. But it turns out it's rather profound.

94
00:11:50,520 --> 00:12:02,600
And so here's the example. If I assign number A of three to the set A, I assign 10 to set B

95
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,240
and a little taffy hiding under this one. So now when I combine them, the number that I assigned

96
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,000
to the set A with B is given by three plus 10 or 13. And that will give me a consistent

97
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,720
means of quantifying these objects.

98
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,560
So how well does this work in general? Well, it works pretty well in general. We use it all the time.

99
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,480
We count all sorts of things from taffy and rocks to gallons of gasoline to cars on the

100
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:43,320
highway to stars in the sky. But let me give you an example where it doesn't quite work.

101
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,560
Because one might be led by because of the generality of the application of the mathematics,

102
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,480
you may be led to thinking that this is some kind of universal physical law.

103
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:01,160
And it's not quite that simple. This is a description. I can emphasize the fact that

104
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:10,920
it's a description by showing that it is observer dependent. So here's another example. I have two

105
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:17,640
sets of objects. Each of these sets contains molecules. And the ones on the left, I have

106
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,360
two butane molecules. And in the set on the right, I have 13 oxygen molecules.

107
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:35,160
This is in the way on my screen. So now I'm going to combine the two. So on the left, I have

108
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:42,120
two molecules. You can see I'm assigning this in number two. On the right, I have 13 molecules.

109
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,480
I give it the number 13. And I'm going to combine them. And you expect to have 15 molecules, which

110
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:55,640
is nice. And that works as long as you don't shake this up and make it too hot. Once you make it too

111
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:06,520
hot, this happens. And you no longer have 15, you have 18. And you have 18 carbon dioxide

112
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:14,600
molecules and water molecules, both. So what went wrong with our little rule of additivity?

113
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,320
In this case, oh, two. It should be two plus. Now you have the numbers up here wrong.

114
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:33,640
But our two plus 13 actually gives me 18. So why did that happen? What went wrong?

115
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:43,160
The answer is quite simple. What went wrong is we violated one of the conditions for the

116
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:53,320
width operator. The width operator lacks closure. You don't have the same kind of stuff at the end

117
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:02,440
that you had in the beginning. So whether addition worked or not depended on our description.

118
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,680
If I were to go back here to the beginning, and instead of assigning, instead of counting out

119
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,560
molecules, if I counted how many atoms I had, and here I have four times two, which is eight,

120
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:23,000
and then 10. So that's 20. So I got 28 atoms on the left. And I have 26 atoms on the right.

121
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,440
And now I throw them together and shake up the box. I still have the same number of atoms.

122
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,360
You can add the number of atoms and you get the right result. So

123
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,840
addition works if you count the atoms, but it doesn't work if you count the molecules.

124
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,280
So that shows that there is a dependence on the level of description that you choose.

125
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:55,800
So whether additivity works depends on the description you chose. And the laws of nature

126
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:02,120
shouldn't depend on description if they're going to be some universal law. So this isn't about a law

127
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:13,880
of nature. This is about describing things with numbers. So of course, there are other

128
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:20,280
operations you can do. You can take three copies of the set A. And I'll call that three of A.

129
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,320
So this is a new operator called of. I can replicate things. And it turns out this of operator

130
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:36,120
is obeys associativity. And the of operator is

131
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,880
distributes across the width operator. So you have distributivity. So here we have

132
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:51,880
associativity and distributivity. And you can prove, again, similar to the proof before,

133
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,320
the associativity means that the number that I assign to, so if I assign a number to,

134
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,920
if I have this number A, and I assign a number to B, a little A and little B,

135
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,480
then the number that I assign to A of B is going to have to be, is going to be some function of

136
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:15,800
little A and little B. And associativity forces that to be isomorphic to addition.

137
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:24,440
But because we used addition for the width operator, the fact that we have distributivity

138
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:32,840
forces that isomorphism to settle on one particular, once particular transform,

139
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:38,280
which is basically multiplication. So multiplication is isomorphic to addition,

140
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,320
so it satisfies the associativity, and the multiplication will satisfy the distributivity.

141
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,760
So this is a theorem. And so the idea is you multiply the numbers together.

142
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,840
So now when I take three of A, if I assign a number three to A, kind of unfortunately I use

143
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,480
three here, basically when I'm done, three of A is going to give me three times three or nine

144
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,200
pieces of taffy. And you can prove that this has to be the case because of associativity and

145
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:20,280
distributivity. So these are rules, rules for consistently quantifying numbers or quantifying

146
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,360
things with numbers. And now we're going to push this to an extreme.

147
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,480
We're going to consider the case that's that we encounter in quantum mechanics where we are

148
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,800
studying very small objects with very small objects. There are, there's a point where we

149
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:48,520
get to where we are studying objects for which there are no smaller probes by which we can use

150
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:58,520
to study these. And we may obtain some number x in a measurement, and which we would use to

151
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:04,040
quantify this interaction. But we have to acknowledge that we're going to have some

152
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:09,000
uncertainty as to the value of this assigned quantity x. You can also think of it this way,

153
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,520
we have some quantity describing the system, some describing the probe. So you put the two together,

154
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,720
you really need two numbers to describe the interaction between the system and the probe.

155
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:28,680
Now this, this uncertainty, the relationship may be more intimate than the usual x plus or minus

156
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:34,200
sigma uncertainty that we're used to from dealing with Gaussian probabilities and probability theory.

157
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:42,440
And instead, and in fact, I would like to, in this case, if I did want to quantify

158
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:49,640
things this way, I would have to derive this plus or minus as, as being a function relating

159
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,000
these two. So to back up and work to do something like that, we're going to not assume that this

160
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:01,480
is the case. Instead, we're going to assign two numbers here. One number is related to the

161
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,040
a number quantifying the interaction x and another is going to x one and say, and the other is going

162
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,200
to be x two, which will quantify uncertainty. We just have two numbers here instead of one.

163
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:21,000
So what happens when we consider similar operations like the width operator and the

164
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,760
of operator, and we start combining things, and we are using two numbers to describe

165
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:39,000
these interactions rather than just one. So we'll look at associative commutivity again,

166
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
which previously was scalars gave in the taffy gave us a sum rule. We find that that's the

167
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,400
case here as well. So if we have some set a something a that's described by two numbers x

168
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,880
one and x two, and then we have a B described by two numbers y one and y two, then a with B,

169
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:05,880
where this width operator is any operator that exhibits closure, associative commutivity and

170
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:13,880
reproducibility, then a with B has to be represented up to isomorphism by component wise

171
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:21,480
summation. So we would then assign for a with B, we would assign numbers x one plus y one is one

172
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:30,520
number and x two plus y two is the second number. That's not so unusual is it's not so different

173
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,120
than you can see the scalar case right there. Things get a little more interesting when you

174
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:43,320
when you consider operator an additional operation like the of operator, where you have

175
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:53,560
associative distributivity as well. So here, upon interaction associative distributivity, which

176
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:00,840
we'll use this operator as dot, is we're trying to figure out what dot would would be. We should

177
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,320
we should have we will have distributivity here we also have associativity and

178
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,120
and we also have that we have component wise summation for the plus here. And that requires

179
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:24,120
that this dot operation has to be bilinear. So whatever numbers x and y you have in the original

180
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:33,320
pairs. The result is when you combine them has got to be some some linear bilinear combination

181
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,480
of these objects where these gammas here are our coefficients that we have to identify.

182
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:47,560
So these basic symmetry these symmetries are common in the systems that we work with and

183
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:57,320
that is why we use addition of the time because we have associative commutivity holds often so

184
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:04,280
addition works. And in physics, generally we have associative commutivity and associative

185
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:12,280
distributivity. And that is why physics is fundamentally linear. Excuse me.

186
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,680
So now, whereas scalar quantification resulted in one multiplication rule, the pairwise

187
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:26,360
quantification where we're carrying with us a number quantifying some uncertainty results

188
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,720
in three multiplication rules, which is interesting.

189
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:40,280
So in that they these come about from looking and seeing what gammas are possible. So it turns

190
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:51,720
out that there are three sets of gammas that are are possible. And they all the different versions

191
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,400
reduced to three different types of operations. One of these here you'll see the first one a

192
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,760
looks like complex multiplication. So you're basically treating these as complex numbers.

193
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:15,320
And B is is similar, but where we have addition here. And C C is also similar, but not the same.

194
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:26,520
We can rewrite this as this as a multiple as a matrix operation, where a looks like this,

195
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,920
B looks like that and that and then we operate on the vector y one, y two.

196
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:40,520
So these are the three different multiplicative operators that we have. And we will see that

197
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:50,200
much of physics comes from these three operators. So without loss of generality, we set the determinant

198
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,560
of these operators to one. And we do that so that repeated application doesn't diverge to infinity

199
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:01,480
or collapse to zero. That would be pointless. And that means that there's really only one free

200
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:09,080
parameter related to the ratio of x two to x one, which gives us three possibilities. We have

201
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:16,840
something like a rotation matrix for multiplication rule a, we have something like a hyperbolic

202
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,280
rotation for multiplication rule B. And we have this other

203
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:32,920
matrix for operation C. Each one, each of these three will obey the symmetry. So they

204
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,680
may be useful in quantifying things in the real world that obey the symmetries or interactions

205
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:47,960
in the real world that obey the symmetries. So we, of course, we can write these operators in

206
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,000
terms of infinitesimal generators. This is what the generators look like. And

207
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:03,320
we then see that generator a is basically rotation by some phase angle

208
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:10,360
and which is what I had originally said. So there's a rotation matrix. So generator a basically

209
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:17,960
rotates by a phase angle and the sum and product rules in these case are those of complex arithmetic

210
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:25,320
and the pairs are complex numbers. Unit quantities identified with unit modulus determinant, which

211
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:35,480
is modulus squared. And we find that the inherent uncertainty in a unit object refers to what is

212
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,760
remains unidentified in X, which is namely the phase, this rotation so that

213
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,480
every time we have an interaction, each new object you interact with brings with it an unknown phase.

214
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:59,560
So now we have to rely on probability to deal with this inherent uncertainty properly.

215
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,080
Our ignorance of phase is uniformly distributed. So we can assign a prior probability to the phase

216
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:13,160
1 over 2 pi. And to obtain the likelihood of a given outcome, which is what we're quantum,

217
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,760
which is what we're computing when we do quantum mechanics, we must marginalize over all of the

218
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,120
unknown parameters, which are all of the unknown phases and the interactions. And if we perform

219
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:32,360
this marginalization, you see that we're basically summing modulus squared quantities. And this is

220
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:39,160
really why quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory. And the likelihood is additive because

221
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:45,400
of the scalar sum rule, and it depends on the modulus squared, which is the Born rule. So you

222
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:56,680
can show that all of these things arise from these simple symmetries. So here you can see,

223
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,240
here it looks like the foundation of quantum theory is pretty elementary and simple.

224
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,640
Quantity and uncertainty fused together into complex numbers with uncertainty really referring

225
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,640
to phase. And the observable quantity is the modulus squared, which is the Born rule for

226
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:21,880
arbitrary amount, and that represents ensemble averages, which is what the experimenter measures.

227
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:34,280
So we have that, what's nice about this is quantum mechanics and probability theory are

228
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:40,840
derived from the same symmetries that can't possibly contradict one another for that reason.

229
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:48,120
And in physics, we make predictions, which are quantified probabilistically in terms of

230
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:57,000
likelihoods. And so given those likelihoods, Bayesian analysis then computes posterior

231
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,200
probabilities, which assess the models and the lights in light of the outcomes that are actually

232
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,320
observed. And that is the relationship between quantum mechanics and Bayesian inference.

233
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:14,120
Quantum mechanics deals with computing likelihoods, and likelihoods are used in performing inference.

234
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:24,040
So now we can go a bit further and see how the multiplication rule B comes into play. These

235
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,880
three different rules are potentially going to be used to describe different types of interactions.

236
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,280
And so rule A, multiplication rule E, A we see is used in quantum mechanics.

237
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,040
What is B good for? Well, B, because these are all possible descriptions, we can then ask what

238
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:52,040
could be possibly described with B or C. They're going to be consistent with the symmetry, so they

239
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:59,800
would be good descriptions of something. And I'll look into that briefly here.

240
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,720
So here we can consider objects that can exist in two states, let's say up and down.

241
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,440
This gives us a quantification consisting of a pair of complex numbers,

242
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:20,600
basically using the rules A, the multiplication rule A, and we'll have pairs of complex numbers now.

243
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:27,480
And qubits, we'll call these qubits, will obey associative distributivity. So the representation

244
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:36,360
is two-dimensional over the complex field. And these generators, these generators that we have

245
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:44,120
will give us the polymatrices. So B, the generator for multiplication rule B gives you sigma x,

246
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,360
I times the generator for multiplication rule A gives you sigma y, and then together

247
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,800
B times A gives you sigma z. So these are the polymatrices.

248
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,400
And so the multiplication rules A and B together give you the concept of spin.

249
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:16,120
And we see that we get the scalar quantifications come from these different, these three polymatrices.

250
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,160
And this gives us a relationship between these new quantifications that we can construct from

251
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,920
these operators. And this is really the first clue that 3 plus 1 spacetime emerges from quantum

252
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:38,600
mechanics. So with complex coefficients, these generators define the six-parameter Lorentz group,

253
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,240
under which ensemble averages of independent samples results in this relationship, which is

254
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:54,120
invariant, or this quantity, which is invariant. So if we go back to those original multiplication

255
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:00,520
rules, these two here together basically give us a six-parameter Lorentz group.

256
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:11,800
So we can see that when you think of these multiplication rules as being constraints that

257
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:19,160
constrain your description of things, you can see that the descriptions we use in physics are

258
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:27,640
actually coming from these constraints, and they ought to be. It gives you the possibility of

259
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:35,000
deriving physics, which is quite interesting. One could have potentially derived physics before

260
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,120
encountering the physical world, which is quite a thought when you imagine that the

261
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,640
physical laws are somehow laws dictated by mother nature. If you think of the physical laws as being

262
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:56,840
constrained equations that constrain any attempts at quantifying physical things, then it's not so

263
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:04,760
surprising. So the shift in perspective on what you mean by a physical law gives you a great

264
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:18,920
deal of freedom. So we now have these symmetries of associativity, commutativity,

265
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:24,280
and associative distributivity, along with consideration of uncertainty, give us the basic

266
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:32,920
mathematical descriptions of the universe. We get from this, you can get the quantum mechanics

267
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:43,560
as a probabilistic theory. The polymatrices and spin derive from multiplication rules A and B.

268
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:50,360
This also gives you concepts of energy and momentum and phase and action. And from that,

269
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,120
you can then integrate using rule C, which I don't have a slide for. I should have made that.

270
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:04,200
I didn't want this to take too long. And you can see that operator C is an integrator.

271
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:11,320
I'll go back to that. Here we go. So here's operator C. If you imagine multiplying at times

272
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:20,920
something like dt on the top and then t0 down below, you can see that this is going to basically

273
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:30,680
integrate phase. So time, it comes about from integrating phase. And this basically allows

274
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:36,600
you to integrate time, which then when combined with the other to allow you to integrate,

275
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:46,440
integrate, you can integrate phase up to obtain time and you can integrate momentum in the other two

276
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:54,600
up to obtaining positions. So it works backwards from what we're used to. What we're used to is we

277
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:03,480
start out with wave functions and we have positions and times and we take derivatives to obtain

278
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,280
energy and momentum, which are supposedly more fundamental. So we basically work backwards

279
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:17,800
in the traditional way. We start out with something higher level, position and momentum and position

280
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,040
and time and we take derivatives to get momentum and energy. This is actually going from the ground

281
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,880
up, which is what I think would be a better foundation. That's how you build things from the

282
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:37,160
bottom up. So here basically we have energy and momentum and phase coming in from the beginning

283
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:45,880
and then with operator C, you can then integrate that to getting a three-dimensional spacetime

284
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,160
and that comes out as an integral of phase and energy and momentum.

285
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:02,600
So this is the direction our work has taken and why does mathematics work, which is a question

286
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:13,160
that's always had me wonder. Here it's easy to see the symmetries. These symmetries constrain

287
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:19,400
our mathematical description of physics, which is why it works and that's why it's derivable,

288
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:30,600
which is interesting. Universes can't just do anything. As long as you have these symmetries

289
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,680
hold, then your description of systems or interactions that obey these symmetries are

290
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,800
going to have to follow these mathematics and that basically is the theorem.

291
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:50,040
So here's one of our most recent papers on this, so I hope you enjoy that and thank you.

292
00:36:50,840 --> 00:37:01,000
Okay. Thank you very much, Kevin, for this nice talk. The people who want to make a question or a

293
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:16,920
comment can indicate it in the chat. I have a little question. Do you think that this analysis can be

294
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:26,840
replicated in another physical theories that use another type of space or spacetime?

295
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,480
Oh, I didn't quite follow that. I'm sorry. The connection wasn't so good for me.

296
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:47,800
Oh, sorry. Do you think that this analysis can be replicated in another theories that

297
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:57,640
use another kind of spacetime like in the string theories? No, that's a good question and that's

298
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:05,480
basically where we're headed with this is we want to see it from what we have so far. It looks like

299
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:14,440
these symmetries allow you to generate spacetime as integrals of more fundamental quantities like

300
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,120
phase and energy and momentum and so we want to look into that to see if you can build spacetime

301
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:26,840
up from that foundation and if you build spacetime that way, if you can do that, then it's going to

302
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:33,400
automatically be consistent with quantum theory. So we would have a theory of spacetime that's

303
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,400
consistent with quantum mechanics from the get go, which is really how you would want it.

304
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:51,320
There's a question from Erika Holi. Hi, Kevin. Thanks for this from this talk. Yeah, it's great.

305
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:57,960
So I wanted to know what's your take on photons because you mentioned that when you count atoms

306
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,280
and molecules, well, that the counting, it depends on the level of description that you are taking,

307
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:12,280
right? But then if I have a laser, an attenuated laser, and you prepare a coherent state,

308
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:18,840
then you will have a superposition of different numbers of photons. So you don't have a definite

309
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:25,720
particle number. So what would be your take in that situation? How many photons do I have or

310
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:32,760
photons in that case will not be real entities and only the quantum field? What would be your take?

311
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,120
Oh, that's a really good question. That's something I hadn't considered.

312
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:47,560
If additivity doesn't work, then you've violated one of those four conditions and that would be my

313
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:58,200
first guess. Then the question would be which of the conditions are violated in that situation.

314
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,880
So in the case where I combine butane molecules with oxygen molecules, the condition that's

315
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:13,000
violated is that of closure. So it's hard to imagine that you're going to have a problem

316
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,400
with closure when combining photons. So yeah, so I'm curious about this. I'll have to think about

317
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:31,080
that. Thank you. That's a very good question. Thanks. Okay, we are in time. So thank you, Kevin.

318
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,160
Okay, thank you so much.
