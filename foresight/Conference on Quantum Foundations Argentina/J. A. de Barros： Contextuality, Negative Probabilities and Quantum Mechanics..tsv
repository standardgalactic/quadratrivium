0	6440	OK, well, it's kind of like a hard task
6440	9160	to start after such a great talk.
9160	12240	I didn't get the whole talk.
12240	14280	It's the end of the semester here,
14280	16560	but it was very interesting what I saw,
16560	20400	and I'm going to sure read more about it.
20400	26120	So what I want to talk today is about negative probabilities
26120	29280	in quantum mechanics, and in particular with respect
29280	30600	to contextuality.
30600	34320	And I think it ties a little bit with the previous talk,
34320	37960	because you can think of that as a way of describing
37960	42520	certain quantum systems that's epistemic.
42520	45760	But at the end of the day, my interest
45760	53240	is in trying to rule out some possible ontological models
53240	54360	as well.
54360	61960	Anyway, so here's the outline of my talk today.
61960	64160	I'm going to start with trying to give some motivation
64160	67400	about negative probabilities, and then
67400	71200	I'm going to talk about how is it that negative probabilities
71200	76760	actually come into this story through contextuality.
76760	81320	And then after that, I'm going to give a definition
81320	86840	of negative probabilities that is more formal than usually one
86840	87680	would find.
87680	89480	And there is a reason for doing that,
89480	93960	and hopefully the motivation is going to make it clear
93960	95560	what is the reason.
95560	101000	So the starting point is the realization
101000	104800	that quantum mechanics, as the previous speaker mentioned,
104800	108840	is a probability theory, in a certain sense.
108840	112120	So what we have in quantum mechanics
112120	116120	is a state for a physical system.
116120	118720	And that state is a vector in a hyperspace,
118720	120480	or a density matrix, whatever.
120480	125080	And we can use that state to infer outcomes of experiments
125080	126000	probabilistically.
126000	128240	So that's what quantum theory gives us,
128240	136280	is this probabilistic description of physical systems.
136320	139600	However, this probabilistic description
139600	144400	that quantum theory gives to us is not fully compatible
144400	146240	with classical probability theory,
146240	151520	in the sense that for some set of observables
151520	155640	for a quantum system, if we look at the experimental outcomes
155640	160280	that quantum theory predicts, you cannot have a joint
160280	163880	probability distribution that describes all those observables
163880	166280	within classical theory.
166280	168480	We have kind of like a name for that.
168480	170680	We say that those theories are contextual.
170680	173520	And in the section about contextuality,
173520	177760	I'm going to outline a little bit more detail of what we mean
177760	183640	by that for those who are not aware of that.
183640	187400	Probably all of you are, but anyway.
187400	193600	So since we cannot describe quantum mechanics
193600	196000	with classic probability theory, it's
196000	200240	natural to ask whether we can modify classic probability theory
200240	202280	to describe quantum systems.
202280	207760	So is it possible that some different probability theory
207760	211680	can actually help us get a better understanding of what's
211680	215200	going on in these quantum systems?
215200	219360	And there are different ways to modify
219360	222240	classic probability theory.
222280	226360	One of them is, well, actually, quantum theory itself,
226360	230000	where we use a probability that's over vectors
230000	231360	in hybrid space.
231360	235320	And that effectively modifies probability theory,
235320	238520	in the sense that not everything is commasurable.
238520	241640	And the algebra of events that you have
241640	244360	is restricted to a lattice.
244360	246520	So you don't have the standard Boolean algebra
246520	247440	of all the events.
247440	249680	And you cannot give a measure of all the events
249680	251160	at the same time.
251160	254000	So that's one possibility is modifying
254000	256280	the algebra of classic probabilities,
256280	260520	because classic probabilities assumes that the events
260520	263720	form an algebra that's a Boolean algebra.
263720	267800	The other way is to modify the additivity rule.
267800	275640	We know, for example, that probability theory, if two sets
276320	281120	belong to this algebra of measurable events,
281120	283960	they are compute.
283960	285760	We compute the probability of those two sets,
285760	287920	the disjoint sets.
287920	290960	Together, the probability of two disjoint sets
290960	293160	is the sum of those probabilities of those sets.
293160	294440	So that's the additivity rule.
294440	295760	So one of the things that we can do
295760	298760	is we can modify that additivity rule.
298760	302040	And that's something that comes out
302040	306480	of definite work on upper and lower probabilities.
306480	308720	And the other possibility is the one
308720	311000	that we're going to be following here
311000	317720	is to modify probabilities such that we don't restrict ourselves
317720	320160	to non-negative values.
320160	324320	So those are ways of extending probability theory.
324320	331080	And so when we think about negative probabilities
332040	339840	or probabilities where the non-negativity of probabilities
339840	343920	is denied, we need to think about it carefully.
343920	346680	And how exactly do we want to define that?
346680	349360	So what we're going to be trying to do today
349360	352760	is introduce a way to describe quantum systems that
352760	356040	violate this non-negatives, the negativeness property,
356040	362560	such that we have, first, a major theoretic formalism that
362560	365200	does that, and second, that we capture
365200	369280	the essence of what we want to have in quantum systems
369280	373480	and physical systems in that theory of probability.
373480	378280	So that's essentially what we want to do today.
378280	381640	So let's start with contextuality.
381640	383440	And I'm going to have a little bit
383440	388000	of a weird, non-historic approach to contextuality
388000	389760	that starts with a historic comment, which
389760	393080	is contextuality originated.
393080	395560	The idea of contextuality originates in language.
395560	400240	And it was well known in the 20th century
400240	403920	in works in pragmatics, for example.
403920	408000	But take the sentence, marry a student near the bank,
408000	408920	observing people.
409920	414120	We can understand the sentence differently,
414120	417480	depending on whether it's preceded or it's followed
417480	419840	by distinct sentences.
419840	423000	For example, take this very same sentence followed
423000	424760	by this statement.
424760	428600	She paused to notice a child amuse herself
428600	430480	with the fishes jumping in the river.
430480	434000	When we read that sentence and we read the first one
434000	437280	together of the second one about a child looking
437280	438900	at fishes in the river, we understand
438900	443180	that bank refers to the bank of a river.
443180	445860	But if, on the other hand, instead of this,
445860	448740	we followed marry a student near the bank,
448740	451260	with this sentence, she noticed the manager punctually
451260	454900	leaving at noon, something that would help with the heist.
454900	457980	We associate bank not with the bank of a river,
457980	461820	but we associate it with a financial institution,
461820	464860	the physical manifestation of a financial institution.
464940	471580	So in this example, the first sentence,
471580	474940	how we understand it, changes of the context
474940	480660	when it's put together with this child looking at fishes,
480660	483500	when it's put together with heist.
483500	485940	So that is the sense in which linguists talk
485940	488980	about contextuality of language.
488980	493180	And we can understand contextuality of language
493180	498380	in terms of a very logic approach to language, which
498380	502300	is the truth functional approach, in which propositions
502300	508300	are the way in which we understand meaning of sentences.
508300	512020	So like, for example, take the two propositions, A and B,
512020	514660	A being marry a student near the river bank,
514660	517460	and B being marry a student near the building
517460	519860	of a financial institution.
519860	523300	Those two sentences, they have different truth values
523300	524340	depending on the context.
524340	527540	In the context of river, A is true and B is false,
527540	531820	whereas in the context of heist, A is false and B is true.
531820	536980	So it's in this sense of truth values
536980	539140	that we can understand contextuality
539140	543980	and actually even relates contextuality in language
543980	546660	to contextuality in quantum mechanics
546660	550020	via random variables.
550020	552660	So let's look at how contextuality in this case
552660	555380	will show up in terms of random variables.
555380	559020	So we can think about those statements A and B
559020	562860	as being modeled by random variables A and B.
562860	564820	I'm going to represent them in both face here
564820	567020	just to distinguish between the statements A and B,
567020	572420	the propositions A and B. And these random variables A and B
572420	576260	modeled it by being dichotomous random variables
576300	578980	with values plus and minus one.
578980	581100	With minus one, for example, corresponding
581100	584300	to the statement being false and plus one corresponding
584300	585740	to the statement being true.
585740	588500	It's kind of like silly to think about random variables
588500	593500	for this particular example because they are not,
596940	598580	they're deterministic random variables
598580	601180	because once a statement is true,
601180	604220	A is always going to be one, right?
604220	608100	And if B is false, B is always going to be minus one.
608100	609620	So it's kind of silly to think about
609620	610540	in terms of random variables,
610540	613500	but there's nothing that forbids us from doing that.
613500	617060	And contextuality here means that there is no single
617060	621700	random variable A and B that represents those concepts
621700	624300	A and B in different contexts,
625620	628060	or represent those truth values in different contexts.
628060	630660	The reason is that a random variable is defined
630660	634180	within a probability space.
634180	637580	And the probabilities, they cannot represent
637580	640380	both A and B simultaneously.
640380	645380	So this is the contextuality that comes in linguistics.
646340	651340	It's, we can call this as a direct influence
651340	654140	of the context on the random variables
654140	657620	because the expectations of the random variables
657620	659500	change directly with the context.
659500	662260	In one context, the expectation of A is one,
662260	666380	in another context, the expectation of A is minus one.
666380	668860	So the expectation changes the context.
668860	672260	This is not what happens in physics
672260	675380	because this type of contextuality
675380	678020	would violate the signaling condition,
678020	681100	but that's a way of representing the linguistic type
681100	683860	of contextuality in terms of random variables.
683860	687660	But once we have that idea of contextuality as changing
687660	690220	the expectations of random variables
691260	696060	in, with respect to the context,
696060	698020	we kind of like have a clue of how is it
698020	699620	that we can extend that to things
699620	701380	that might be more relevant to physics.
701380	705180	So let's take a more subtle case, right?
705180	710180	Let's take three, that column was random variables x, y, and z.
711700	713960	So plus or minus one random variables.
714960	717760	And let's just assume that their expectation is zero.
717760	721240	So we don't know, it's kind of like tossing a coin
721240	722400	for x, y, and z.
722400	725080	We don't know whether it's true or false
725080	727960	every time that we observe it,
727960	731960	but they're perfectly correlated among themselves.
731960	736960	So x is perfectly anti-correlated with y,
736960	739240	x is perfectly anti-correlated with z,
739240	742840	and perfectly anti-correlated with z and y.
742920	745280	Z and y are perfectly anti-correlated.
745280	747440	And it's a very straightforward to see that
747440	752040	if we have such cases where x, y, x, z, and y, z
752040	755600	are anti-correlated, that there is something funky going on.
755600	758800	And the way to see there is something funky going on
758800	762280	is just to notice that, for example, if x equals one,
762280	765400	this guy here implies that y equals minus one.
765400	767600	And if x equals one, this guy here implies
767600	769040	that z equals minus one.
770040	773000	But minus one times minus one is one.
775040	780040	However, this guy here tells us that y times z is minus one,
780400	782080	which is a contradiction.
782080	784720	So there is something wrong going on.
784720	789280	And what is wrong is that when we're using this reasoning
789280	794280	of x being implying y equals minus one here
794480	796880	in this first equation, and then we're using it
796880	799640	as implying z here in this second equation,
799640	801880	and then using to get the multiplication
801880	803640	in the third equation, we're assuming
803640	807280	that all three random variables are defined together.
807280	809200	That means that we're assuming there's a joint
809200	810520	probability distribution.
811840	813720	But it doesn't exist.
813720	817200	Assuming that x in the context of y is the same
817200	819560	as x in the context of z is what's leading
819560	822280	as your contradiction, assuming that all three of them
822280	824320	are observable at the same time
824320	825800	is leading as your contradictions.
825840	828400	And we know that this happens in quantum mechanics,
828400	831800	that there are things that we cannot absorb at the same time.
831800	834600	So can we see something like that in quantum mechanics?
834600	836360	And the answer is yes.
836360	840320	A very famous example is the GHZ states.
840320	844040	We have three particles, one, two, and three,
844040	848880	that are in an entangled state where either all three
848880	852360	of them have spin in the direction z being plus,
852360	856240	or all three of them have spin in the direction z being minus,
856240	859280	and then we have a superposition of those two states.
859280	861680	And then it's easy to see that these guys
861680	865680	have the following eigenstates.
865680	868280	For example, if we measure spin of particle one
868280	871040	in the direction x, measure spin in the particle two
871040	874240	in the direction y, and three in the direction y,
874240	877360	the product of those three spins is always gonna be one.
878520	881040	In the other hand, if we measure y, x, y,
881040	884120	it's also gonna be one, y, y, x is also one,
884120	887000	but x, x, x is minus one.
888320	893320	So we can try to look at it in terms of random variables.
894360	896440	Let's say we have an x-random variable
896440	899600	for spin in the direction x, a y-random variable
899600	901440	for spin in the direction y,
901440	905000	and then we assume them to be context independent.
905000	909080	And if we do that, we can multiply this guy here,
909080	912200	the random variables corresponding to this spin,
912200	917200	x, y, y, times the spin y, x, y, times y, y, x,
918320	922280	and each one of those guys in parentheses are equal to one.
922280	925360	And when we multiply them, we can now collect
925360	928480	all the y's together and all the x's together,
928480	930400	and the square of something that's closer
930400	933160	minus one is always one.
933160	936700	And when we do that, this guy here's one,
936700	940780	and we get a contradiction that one is equal to minus one
940780	944960	from this quantum mechanical computation.
944960	946340	Of course, it's not a contradiction
946340	949460	because what we're getting as contradiction
949460	954460	is based on the assumption that the y in the context of x
954900	958740	and y, y two in the context of x one and y three
958740	963220	is the same as the y two in the context of y one and x three.
963220	964060	So in other words,
964060	966580	we're assuming a joint probability distribution.
968500	973500	So when we have a set of random variables
977900	980340	that are contextual,
980340	982340	there is no joint probability distribution
982340	983460	for all the variables.
983460	986000	There is, of course, a joint probability distribution
986000	988180	for each one of those contexts,
988180	990940	but when you put all those six random variables together,
990940	992420	there is no joint probability distribution.
992420	995220	There's no single probability space,
996140	1001140	omega fp such that the random variables xi and yi
1001700	1003580	models all the quantum outcomes.
1003580	1008580	That's not possible in standard probability theory.
1014060	1016180	Of course, we know that the quantum formalism
1016180	1017940	provides an answer.
1017940	1021500	We can use the quantum formalism as we shown here
1021540	1025260	to compute the expectations of actual observables
1025260	1026940	that we can measure together,
1028220	1030340	but are there alternatives to quantum model?
1030340	1032740	And more importantly,
1032740	1037180	are there alternatives to the quantum model useful for us
1037180	1041260	to think about what's going on with the quantum case?
1042180	1044860	We don't know whether those alternatives are useful,
1044860	1048060	but we feel that perhaps understanding them better
1048060	1052180	might be a way to at least understand
1052180	1055140	what is it that they can bring to this discussion
1055140	1057620	of what the quantum model or quantum,
1057620	1060220	of what the hub or space formula is telling us.
1060220	1062380	So the alternatives that have been tried,
1062380	1064620	as I mentioned, are upper and lower probabilities,
1064620	1066860	and of course, there are negative probabilities
1066860	1069820	that we wanna expand more today.
1070780	1074600	So let's go into defining negative probabilities.
1079060	1082260	To understand how we define negative probabilities,
1082260	1086500	it's useful to see how we define standard probability theory.
1086500	1087340	Right?
1087340	1090020	So the most accepted definition
1090020	1093500	of standard probability theory is by Komagorov.
1093500	1096540	He gave a set theoretic definition
1096540	1099860	of classic probability theory as being the triplets,
1099860	1104860	omega Fp, where omega is a sample space that you have.
1108260	1113260	F is an algebra over that sample space omega
1114220	1119220	that is actually a sigma algebra, a countable algebra,
1121300	1125660	and P is a function that takes elements of this algebra
1125660	1128740	to this interval zero and one.
1128740	1131420	And the restrictions that we have for P
1131420	1135460	is that the measure of omega or the whole set
1135460	1138380	of possibilities is equal to one.
1138380	1139700	In other words, the probability
1139700	1144700	that something happens is one.
1144700	1149700	And the other assumption is that the additivity rule
1152700	1156300	holds for this function.
1156300	1158540	In other words, for any denumerable
1158540	1162940	and this joint family of elements of this algebra F, Ai,
1163900	1168900	the probability of A, say A1 or A2
1170940	1174660	is the sum of the probability of A and the probability of two.
1174660	1178260	So that's something that's a requirement
1178260	1180380	of probability theory.
1180380	1184820	And because this is a number between zero and one,
1184820	1186500	this probability is monotonic.
1186500	1191500	So if you have a set A, the probability of adding something
1191500	1194540	more to that set A, that's this joint of A,
1194540	1198500	increases the probability of absorbing that event.
1198500	1200780	So if you add more possibilities,
1200780	1202580	this becomes more probable.
1202580	1207580	And in quantum mechanics, this is not quite the case.
1207940	1211100	It's non-monotonic, but this is something
1211100	1214020	that I'm not gonna talk too much about.
1214020	1216060	So how do we get negative probabilities?
1216060	1219420	We might be tempted to just violate this requirement
1219420	1221420	and we're done with it.
1221420	1224300	But the problem is that there are certain constraints
1224300	1225700	about negative probabilities
1225700	1229620	that at least seem to make sense,
1229620	1232980	which is that first and foremost,
1232980	1235500	we never directly observe a negative probability.
1235500	1237300	What the heck does it mean to even observe
1237300	1238540	a negative probability?
1240500	1242740	So we need to understand how exactly
1242740	1245100	does the negative probability show
1245100	1248420	in terms of directly observable quantities.
1248540	1252100	And observables are not parts of komagorov stock.
1252100	1253900	So we need to include that.
1253900	1257460	And furthermore, there's no connection
1257460	1262220	if we just like relax this requirement
1262220	1267220	that ties the marginals to the empirical observable contexts.
1267220	1270700	So what we're gonna do here is just try to show
1270700	1272340	how we can define negative probabilities
1272340	1273380	with those ideas in mind.
1273380	1276860	So that's our major theoretic definition
1276860	1278300	of negative probabilities.
1280580	1285380	It's gonna be a little bit abstract from now on,
1285380	1288020	but I'm gonna try to give the main ideas
1288020	1291300	of what is the outlining of this definition, right?
1291300	1295980	We start with a sample space, not a sample space.
1295980	1299940	We start with the concept of assigned measure.
1299940	1304580	So assigned measure is exactly the same as a measure,
1304620	1307700	except that instead of having a measure
1307700	1311460	going from a sigma algebra to the set
1311460	1313980	of non-negative real numbers,
1313980	1318060	assigned measure is something that takes the sets
1318060	1323060	of elements of the algebra into any real number,
1324180	1325740	including negative numbers.
1326420	1330020	And this is well known in measure theory.
1330020	1333740	So it's something that has been studied extensively.
1333740	1337620	And essentially, if we restrict the assigned measure
1337620	1340820	to non-negative numbers, we get a regular measure.
1340820	1342780	And if we restrict this measure
1342780	1347780	such that mu of omega for this measure is equal to one,
1351060	1352980	we get probabilities.
1352980	1356900	So that's the starting point.
1356900	1359220	We start with assigned measure space
1359220	1363660	that has the additivity rule as part of it.
1363660	1367340	And then once we have this assigned measure space,
1367340	1369180	we need to find a way to connect it
1369180	1373060	to the actual observations that we have.
1373060	1377900	And the starting point is to create an object
1377900	1380260	that's not quite a random variable,
1380260	1382620	but it's what we call an extended random variable
1382620	1386260	because instead of being defined over a probability space,
1386260	1391260	we're defining it into assigned measure space.
1392140	1396180	And the idea is just that if the assigned measure space
1396180	1397740	then becomes a probability space,
1397740	1400420	those random variables become regular random variables.
1401380	1404780	And the definition is just the standard definition
1404780	1407300	of random variable where you have a function
1407300	1409180	that goes from your sample space
1409180	1414180	to some real number M that's parts of a sets.
1416220	1419140	This should be this M here, something wrong here.
1419260	1421900	Anyway, and such that this function
1421900	1424100	is a measurable function in the sense
1424100	1425780	of this measure that we have.
1425780	1428900	It's a measure induced definition.
1429900	1433220	And then from this, we can kind of like start
1433220	1437020	to narrow down the idea of contexts.
1437020	1439620	And contexts are just proper subsets
1439620	1441300	of those random variables,
1441300	1445220	such that there is a sub sigma algebra
1445220	1448500	for each one of those subsets of the random variables.
1449220	1454220	That define a probability space
1456100	1458540	for those random variables there.
1458540	1460780	So intuitively we'll have this bunch
1460780	1463300	of extended random variables.
1463300	1464940	And we have this measure space
1464940	1467140	describing those extended random variables.
1467140	1469740	But then we get a subspace of that.
1469740	1474140	And this subspace has a measure space associated to it
1474140	1477380	such that we actually have proper random variables
1477380	1478620	in this subspace.
1479980	1484980	And this allows us to talk now
1486660	1489740	about families of signed probabilistic models
1489740	1494380	that have just those contexts defined for those families
1494380	1496740	and then measures in this context.
1496740	1499820	I'm gonna skip a little bit faster in this.
1501460	1503780	And then once we do that,
1503780	1508700	we can find a concept of a general context
1508700	1512460	that just has like the same idea of the broader one.
1512460	1516820	But now we're saying that those are just for those guys
1516820	1521620	that look like probabilities in the subspace.
1523500	1528500	So finally, we have like those families
1529980	1532460	of signed probability models.
1532460	1534500	And those families of signed probability models,
1534500	1537740	what you have are those like functions
1537740	1539900	that reproduce all the expectations
1539900	1542640	that you have on the contexts.
1542640	1546500	But it's kind of like the wild west here
1546500	1549860	because they can be as large or as small as you want.
1549860	1553700	And what we need to do then is tame a little bit
1553700	1555900	those set of functions by saying,
1555900	1560900	look, if we now take the sum of all the probabilities,
1560940	1564180	the extended probabilities that we have
1564180	1569180	over the sample space for each one of those elements
1569980	1575020	of this signed probability spaces, we get a value.
1575020	1579660	And what we want are the smallest possible values possible
1579660	1580980	because when that happens,
1580980	1583620	we're as close as we can be
1583620	1585860	to a proper probability distribution.
1585860	1590220	In fact, this is gonna come up in a theorem later on.
1590220	1591300	And when we do that,
1591300	1594660	when we ask for the minimum value of the sum,
1595580	1599340	then we call that a negative probability space.
1599340	1603380	It's when this minimum is obtained.
1605020	1608160	If we do that, then we have the following theorem.
1609300	1612020	Imagine that you have now this guy
1612020	1614620	as a minimum signed probability space
1614620	1616660	or as a negative probability space.
1617660	1622660	So if this M defined as the sum of the probabilities
1624020	1628220	of elements of the sample space is equal to one,
1628220	1630860	then this is a probability space.
1630860	1633620	It's very intuitive to see why that is.
1633620	1637340	It's because if you remove the absolute value of this,
1637340	1639440	this is just the probability of omega,
1639440	1641820	which is always one for a probability space.
1641820	1644780	And what you're saying is that nothing is pulling
1644780	1646940	that probability higher or lower
1646940	1648540	because the sum of the absolute values
1648540	1650820	is the same as the sum without absolute values.
1650820	1653080	There's nothing negative here.
1653080	1654620	It's all non-negative.
1654620	1656380	So this is also a probability space.
1656380	1660340	And alternatively, if this guy,
1660340	1663020	it's missing the both face omega here,
1663020	1665740	but if this is a probability space,
1665740	1670740	then it's also a signed probability space of M equals one.
1670780	1674500	Additionally, a collection of extended random variables
1674540	1676340	of this space is contextual,
1676340	1680420	if and only if M is not one.
1681900	1686900	So we have here criteria for contextuality
1687940	1692820	just showing up in the definition of negative probabilities.
1692820	1696020	I'm gonna skip this because I'm running out of time,
1698700	1702700	but this is how you can connect it to a quantum mechanics.
1705020	1707300	I gotta say there are lots of different ways
1707300	1709700	in which negative probabilities connect to a quantum mechanics.
1709700	1714020	For example, the previous speaker mentioned about PR boxes.
1715380	1718940	You can, as long as you have no signaling,
1718940	1721180	you can describe any correlations
1721180	1722660	in terms of negative probabilities.
1722660	1726260	So you can describe PR boxes in terms of negative probabilities.
1726260	1731020	You can describe GHC in terms of negative probabilities
1731020	1733440	or Bell in terms of negative probabilities.
1734440	1738440	But a natural question that often comes up
1741360	1743640	comes up in this discussion of negative probabilities
1743640	1745720	is what are the interpretations
1745720	1748800	that we can give to a negative probabilities?
1750680	1753640	I'm gonna talk about three possible interpretations.
1754920	1758960	Andrei Krenikov, he uses
1759960	1764800	a piatic matrix to give an interpretation
1764800	1768480	of negative probabilities as a violation
1768480	1772800	of von Mises principle of stability.
1772800	1774920	So as we know,
1779120	1781840	if you wanna have a frequentist interpretation
1781840	1784400	of probabilities, what are probabilities?
1784400	1788000	And von Mises defines probabilities
1788000	1793000	as being over infinite sequences
1793920	1798520	of possible outcomes on the sample space,
1798520	1800640	of possible values in the sample space.
1801760	1805640	And those probabilities are only defined
1805640	1807560	for those infinite sequences
1807560	1809640	if they converge to a number.
1809640	1812240	So that's what Mises principle of stability.
1812240	1817240	So what Krenikov noticed is that for certain sequences
1817880	1820640	that violate the principle of stability,
1820640	1823360	you can actually define probabilities for them
1823360	1827000	if you use a piatic metric.
1827000	1831000	And when you do that, the sequences that violate
1833440	1835040	von Mises principle of stability
1835040	1837600	actually take negative values.
1837600	1840680	So that's the interpretation that he gives,
1840680	1843800	is that negative probabilities are associated with numbers
1843800	1846640	that violate the principle of stability,
1846640	1850360	which in terms of like, if you are trying to understand,
1850360	1853200	for example, Bell correlations,
1853200	1855600	it means that those sequences
1855600	1857800	that you're assuming to be independent,
1857800	1859480	they're not actually independent.
1860480	1861800	Because...
1861800	1865440	You have 10 minutes including the question.
1865440	1867920	Oh yeah, I'm just finishing it.
1867920	1870400	Just finishing the rotations.
1870400	1871240	Thanks.
1871680	1876680	So another interpretation is proposed
1877000	1878720	by Bromsky and Brandenburger.
1878720	1882000	It's actually based on the composition theorem
1882000	1885640	that shows that if you have a signed measure,
1885640	1887880	you can always break it down into two measures,
1887880	1890440	one positive and one negative,
1890440	1893920	and each one of them independently are non-signed measures.
1893920	1896600	And what they do is they just attach a sign
1896600	1900680	to each one of the outcomes of an experiment,
1900680	1901960	and then those signs,
1901960	1904680	they lead to cancellation of certain events.
1905640	1906920	There's a third interpretation,
1906920	1908520	which is the one put forth by Derrack
1908520	1909760	and later on by Feynman,
1911360	1914280	which is that probabilities,
1914280	1916600	negative probabilities for that matter,
1916600	1920000	are just a bookkeeping device.
1921280	1924760	So in that sense,
1924760	1926920	negative probabilities are nothing more
1927520	1931400	than the same as we do with negative numbers.
1931400	1932440	So for example,
1932440	1935440	we never observe a negative number of apples.
1935440	1937320	In fact, it's nonsensical to talk about
1937320	1940640	a negative number of numbers as an actual observable,
1940640	1944880	but it doesn't mean that using negative numbers of apples
1944880	1947760	is not a useful book counting device.
1949080	1951160	We never observe a negative number of dollars
1951160	1952480	for that matter either.
1952480	1956880	It doesn't mean that one never has negative numbers
1956880	1959640	in an account as a bookkeeping device
1959640	1961760	for how much money we have in an account.
1962880	1967880	And the reason why I'm mentioning numbers here
1969400	1972680	is because the concept of even using negative numbers
1973640	1977400	has not been always non-controversial.
1977400	1978800	Consider, for example,
1978800	1980360	the following quote by De Morgan,
1980360	1983160	the famous mathematician and logician
1983160	1984920	in a book that he wrote in the 30s.
1984920	1986860	And I'll read the quote to you.
1986940	1989220	Above all, he, the student,
1989220	1991900	must reject the definition still sometimes given
1991900	1995580	of the quantity minus A, that it is less than nothing.
1996620	1998420	It is astonishing that the human intellect
1998420	2000940	should ever have tolerated such an absurdity
2000940	2003620	as the idea of a quantity less than nothing.
2003620	2006620	Above all, that the notion should have outlived the beliefs
2006620	2009580	in judicial astrology and the nonexistence of witches,
2009580	2013180	either of which is 10,000 times more possible.
2013300	2017900	So as late as like the 1800s,
2017900	2019820	negative numbers were still considered
2019820	2022300	like an absurd idea by some.
2023460	2027140	And it might be the case that negative probabilities
2029060	2031540	will in the future be considered the same
2031540	2033380	as we consider negative numbers,
2033380	2036500	something just natural, like natural numbers are
2036500	2038780	as a bookkeeping device.
2038780	2042380	So just to summarize what I talked today,
2043580	2046620	as we discussed, contextuality is a key characteristic
2046620	2047860	of quantum properties.
2049300	2053220	We often use hybrid space formalism to describe
2053220	2056460	those quantum properties and the hybrid space formalism
2056460	2058700	has built in that contextuality.
2060420	2065420	That contextuality cannot be represented
2065460	2067900	in probability theory unless you do something
2067900	2071140	like for example, the approach of contextuality by default
2071180	2074060	by increasing the number of random variables.
2074060	2076620	But that goes against a little bit the idea
2076620	2081620	that we do in physics because we have the same measurement
2085300	2087180	apparatus for some of those things.
2088980	2092620	But extended probability theories can be constructed.
2092620	2095740	And here we just presented a measure theoretic framework
2095740	2097980	for defining an extended probability
2097980	2102980	that we feel captures at least the gist
2103660	2106980	of quantum contextuality in the sense that we can model
2106980	2110780	quantum contextuality with that probability theory.
2110780	2112620	And we hope that such tool may be used
2112620	2113980	when describing quantum phenomena.
2113980	2116700	Like for example, we know that it implies
2116700	2120420	the no signaling condition, which is part of quantum systems.
2120420	2124820	But it's still unclear whether it's useful or not.
2124820	2129820	So I just wanna end with acknowledging my collaborators.
2133780	2137340	What I talked today is in essence part of a paper
2137340	2140580	that I did with Federico Halleck
2140580	2143060	who's organizing this conference.
2143060	2145180	But I also benefited from a lot of discussions
2145180	2149380	of many people in particular, those people listed here.
2149380	2150700	So thank you.
2151540	2154300	Okay, thank you, Jose, for your talk.
2154300	2156660	There are some questions in the chat.
2156660	2159900	The first one is from Shansen.
2163500	2166820	All right, thank you for that talk.
2166820	2169460	My question is about, has to do with sort of rhetoric
2169460	2170460	and pedagogy.
2170460	2174940	So, you know, like we, it sounds like we think very much
2174940	2177500	the same way about quantum mechanics is basically
2178380	2183060	like a new framework for handling probabilities.
2184260	2186900	And I wonder whether it's the smartest strategy
2186900	2189100	to convince people of our view
2189100	2191740	that you now like have to like get used to the idea
2191740	2192860	of negative probabilities.
2192860	2194260	I mean, if you start, I mean,
2194260	2196620	you're very nicely laid out the difference.
2196620	2198380	Like, you know, you have contextuality, right?
2198380	2201780	You don't, but quantum mechanics doesn't allow you
2201780	2203340	to have joint probabilities, right?
2203340	2206980	You can't assign values to all the different variables.
2206980	2211100	I wonder if there isn't like sort of a more natural way
2211100	2214980	of like ramming that down people's throats
2214980	2217020	than going this route of introducing
2217020	2218300	negative probabilities.
2219420	2220900	Yeah, thank you.
2220900	2224700	I confess that I would probably never teach
2224700	2226980	negative probabilities to my students.
2228340	2231860	Well, never, I mean, maybe in the future.
2231860	2234220	That's not the reason why I'm talking
2234220	2235860	about negative probabilities actually.
2235940	2238140	The reason why I'm talking about negative probabilities
2238140	2243140	is because I hope that by trying to understand
2244660	2247500	certain phenomena in terms of negative probabilities,
2247500	2250820	we might be able to get different insights
2250820	2253260	into those phenomena that we would not get
2253260	2255860	from the Hebert space formalism.
2255860	2259500	I can give you a specific example, right?
2259500	2264500	So when we look at different principles
2265980	2269220	that define quantum mechanics that people have tried,
2269220	2274060	like for example, Cabello have tried to define some principles
2274060	2275940	that give us quantum mechanics.
2276900	2279860	When you write them down in terms of negative probabilities,
2279860	2280980	they become clear.
2282340	2285700	Whether that's a useful tool for us to understand
2285700	2288140	what's going on with quantum mechanics or not,
2288140	2291540	I don't know because I didn't get any special insights
2291540	2293060	from that, but that's my hope, right?
2293060	2294740	That's what I'm trying to do.
2294740	2297540	I'm trying to see if we can understand
2297540	2299940	different types of quantum puzzles
2299940	2301420	in terms of negative probabilities
2301420	2304020	such that we can get better insight from them.
2304020	2307220	If we do, then perhaps in the future,
2307220	2309700	we might even try to teach our students that,
2309700	2311340	but we're not there yet.
2312700	2313540	Okay, thank you.
2315660	2320660	And there is another question from Alison Decini.
2321700	2323580	Hi, can you hear me?
2323580	2325260	Yes, I can hear you.
2325260	2327700	Okay, so thanks for the very nice question.
2328980	2331340	My question is about Cauchy-Speccher theorem.
2331340	2334780	So how do you avoid Cauchy-Speccher theorem
2334780	2336300	in this kind of framework?
2336300	2338940	Because Cauchy-Speccher theorem
2338940	2341860	rule out the existence of evaluations.
2341860	2345220	And if we represent all measurements
2345220	2347220	as random variables in the same,
2347220	2349020	sharing the same sample space,
2349020	2352540	a point of the sample space would be evaluation.
2352580	2357580	So how can you avoid Cauchy-Speccher theorem
2359420	2360820	within this approach?
2360820	2362060	That's my question.
2364220	2367420	If I understand your question correctly,
2367420	2371620	you're asking how I avoid Cauchy-Speccher and we don't.
2371620	2376620	Let me go back to the GHZ case,
2378060	2380940	which is a, so the difference
2380940	2382460	between GHZ and Cauchy-Speccher
2382460	2385780	that GHZ is for a specific state
2385780	2388420	and Cauchy-Speccher is for any state, right?
2388420	2393420	It's about the algebra of quantum observables.
2394660	2397620	But you could think of Cauchy-Speccher
2397620	2402620	as a series of measurements that prepare a state
2402620	2405420	and then later on you get a contradiction.
2405420	2407780	That's a different way to think about Cauchy-Speccher,
2407780	2410900	but it's all there together.
2410900	2415900	But this is the GHZ also has a contradiction, right?
2416220	2418940	And the contradiction comes here
2418940	2421660	from this guy in the bottom.
2421660	2424580	This first parenthesis being one times one times one
2424580	2426340	being equal to minus one.
2426340	2428460	It's the same type of contradiction
2428460	2430980	that you get on Cauchy-Speccher.
2430980	2434380	And you are using random variables
2434380	2438940	because each one of them individually are random.
2438940	2442260	But if you look at each one of those products,
2442260	2445220	if you thought of them as an individual random variable,
2445220	2447420	let's say we call this product A,
2447420	2450980	we call this product B and we call this product C.
2450980	2455300	What we have is that A times B times C is equal to D.
2456900	2460860	But this is what quantum mechanics tells us,
2460860	2463140	but A is equal to one, B is equal to one
2463140	2465900	and C is equal to one whereas D is equal to minus one.
2465900	2467300	That's the contradiction.
2467300	2469620	And the random variables that we have here
2469620	2471680	are deterministic random variables.
2472900	2476580	So I don't know if I'm answering your question
2476580	2478460	the way you thought about it,
2478460	2481260	but what I'm saying is we're not avoiding it.
2481260	2483780	We have the contradictions there,
2483780	2485820	but the contradictions come
2485820	2487580	from the assumptions of Cauchy-Speccher.
2487580	2489460	And the assumption of Cauchy-Speccher
2489460	2493980	is that this guy here, say Y2 in this context
2493980	2496780	is the same as the Y2 in this context.
2496780	2499220	And when we use negative probabilities,
2499220	2502140	that assumption is not true anymore
2502140	2504780	because negative probabilities
2504780	2507480	are washing out those requirements
2507480	2511080	of how is it that those random variables are related.
2512380	2515740	And then what you're asking about,
2516700	2519060	if you were to ask me how exactly
2519060	2520500	they are washing out those requirements,
2520500	2522860	I would tell, wow, I don't know.
2522860	2526220	That's how we book keep those probabilities.
2526220	2528100	If you wanna know how they are doing that,
2528100	2530260	then you would need to go to an interpretation
2530260	2533220	that is not a purely epistemic interpretation
2533220	2534300	as in bookkeeping.
2535700	2538700	And there's nothing that forbids you from doing that, right?
2540380	2541900	Does that make sense, what I'm saying?
2541900	2545140	Or am I being confused here, confusing?
2545140	2547900	Yeah, yeah, no, it makes sense.
2547900	2549220	Thanks, thank you.
2551820	2554780	Okay, we are done of the break.
2554780	2558120	So, but there is one more question.
2560060	2561260	It is very fast.
2561260	2564900	So perhaps I can make it, if it's okay with you.
2564900	2568100	So it is just about the notion of contextuality
2568100	2569940	that you seem to be using.
2571140	2572900	I'm just curious if you are familiar
2572900	2576540	with the work of Speckens and this idea
2576540	2579340	of using a different definition of contextuality
2579340	2583140	than the one that seems to be used in Gohan Specker
2583140	2587420	and in Bell's proof of non-contextuality.
2588420	2591980	And if that makes a difference in the kind of project
2591980	2596980	that you are using to accommodate all of contextuality
2597860	2599940	using negative probabilities.
2601340	2604060	Yeah, that's a good question.
2606620	2610580	One could give a whole talk about like different ways
2610580	2612860	of thinking about contextuality, right?
2612860	2615900	So I've been very casual about talking
2615900	2619820	about contextuality here and very specific about it.
2619820	2624700	But it's unclear exactly how those different notions
2624700	2627660	of contextuality relate to each other.
2627660	2630780	Sometimes, not all the time, right?
2630780	2635780	And to be very precise, one would need to prove
2639220	2642380	what is the relationship between one definition
2642380	2645900	of contextuality and another definition of contextuality.
2645900	2649300	And as far as I know, that has not been done
2649300	2651620	for all notions of contextuality.
2651620	2654420	But there is this intuition that they kind of like
2654420	2656580	are talking about the same thing.
2656580	2658260	Because at the end of the day,
2658260	2662060	they're all about commasurable properties
2662060	2664300	and how those commasurable properties
2664300	2669060	somehow are related to not having a possibility
2669100	2672420	of talking about all of those properties at the same time,
2673980	2676020	in terms of the intuition behind them.
2678660	2680100	I know I'm not answering your question
2680100	2682220	and the reason why I'm not answering your question
2682220	2683940	is because I'm trying to say that I don't think
2683940	2688100	there is a very clear answer to that question yet.
2688100	2691020	But we hope that once we give a definition
2691020	2693460	that's a measure theoretic definition,
2693460	2696220	that precise definition of negative probabilities
2696220	2701020	that correspond to also a definition of contextuality
2701020	2705220	in that setup, that you can use that to prove theorems
2705220	2708860	about how those things are related.
2708860	2712300	It might be really, really interesting to explore that
2712300	2715660	for two reasons, because the kind of definition
2715660	2718580	that the Speckens uses makes no explicit reference
2718580	2721700	to the idea of measuring two things at the same time.
2721700	2725820	It is kind of different to the general idea.
2725820	2728620	And two, because in the original paper,
2728620	2730780	I think that that's from 25,
2730780	2733900	he has a small derivation of showing that
2733900	2737500	from his definition, you can derive the traditional one,
2737500	2739820	the one that the Cohen Speckens used.
2739820	2744380	So there must be a connection.
2744380	2747620	Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
2749100	2751260	All those things are related,
2751260	2755500	but how exactly they are related, it's not.
2756260	2758860	Intuitively, yes, they should be related,
2758860	2761300	but it's one thing to think that they should be related
2761300	2763740	intuitively and to prove that they're related.
2763740	2765820	So that's what I was trying to say.
2768540	2773100	Thank you, Jose, and the people who have questions
2773100	2775740	would have some minutes to go to the bathroom
2775740	2777220	or take a coffee.
2777220	2778060	We will back.
