0	20440	Okay, welcome to the session number two is now I have the pressure to present to Kevin
20440	28680	Nutt from the University of Albany. He will talk about quantity with uncertainty,
30120	33640	defines the basics of quantum mechanics and space.
35400	42760	All right, great. Thank you for having me. Hello, everyone. And yes, I'm doing this. This work has
42760	53000	been working on this with John Skilling from Ireland and so we'll dive right in as long as
53000	61960	everyone can see my screen here. So this work basically takes advantage of a slightly different
61960	72920	perspective of what we are doing in physics. Instead of thinking about the natural laws,
73640	79640	the laws of nature as being laws that are dictated by mother nature that we all have to obey,
81160	84360	we're looking at I'm looking at this from a perspective of
85240	93080	of people wanting to quantify things. And we've gotten so used to quantifying
93880	98920	things. And by that, I mean assigning numbers to things that we almost give it no second,
98920	107560	no additional thought. And of course, this is a very simple process. We learn to do this as
107560	113560	children. We assign numbers for different properties of objects. And the larger things are typically
113560	119000	assigned larger numbers. And of course, there's some arbitrariness here, there's some some choice
119000	124920	you can make. So here I have pictures of some batteries, 1.5 volt battery, a six volt battery,
124920	133240	a 12 volt battery. And so we are assigning numbers to one aspect of these, this set of batteries.
133880	143560	And classically, we tend to, because we're so familiar with this, we have come to
144680	153320	think of these quantities as being properties of the objects themselves. So, so in fact,
153800	159640	we even use them in the name. It's a, this is a 12 volt battery. And that's the
161560	167480	that number 12 is considered to be a property of the battery, which I, which I think is a very,
168200	177240	that's a little too strong. And you can start to see where this is going to be problematic when we
177240	183960	consider things like very small objects, where the probes that we're using to study them are
183960	190360	equally small. The assigned quantities in these cases really describe interactions rather than
190360	203480	describing properties of the objects. So we often, you know, our language often governs how we think
203480	210360	and how we think is described by our language. So these two things are coupled and very often
210360	217720	we'll hear people say or will, or will, I myself will say things like an electron has an energy E
217720	224680	or has a momentum P. And, and that's really not a good way to think about it. The electron can't
225480	231480	possess a momentum because the momentum of an, of an electron is really observer dependent.
232040	236200	You boost to another observer in a different frame and they'll measure a different momentum
236200	240040	for the object. They'll say this, no, this electron has this momentum P. And of course,
240040	246360	we know how these two numbers are related. But, but I think that one of the difficulties that
246360	255000	we've faced conceptually is, is taking these numbers that we're assigning as descriptions of,
256040	260520	of objects, descriptions of properties of objects, descriptions of the way that they're
260600	268920	interacting with observers and attributing them to being numbers describing properties of the
268920	275960	objects. And that I think that's really a wrong way of thinking and it's caused us a good bit of
275960	283080	trouble. The momentum and position and energy, these types of quantities really are describing
283080	289480	the relationship between the electron and the observer. And so momentum is one description
289480	295880	of the relationship position is a different description of that relationship. And the fact
295880	302120	that the two descriptions are incommensurate really isn't surprising or unusual. They're just
302120	308840	two different descriptions. And so there's been in quantum mechanics, historically, there's been a
308840	319880	lot of puzzlement over the fact that how can, how can an electron not have a definite position
319880	326680	and a definite momentum at any given time? Well, the fact is the electron doesn't have either.
327800	334040	Those are descriptions of the relationship between the electron and the observer. And you can't
334760	340600	have both of those descriptions can't hold at the same time. That's really what's going on there.
341320	347480	It's really only mysterious if you think of these quantities as properties. So we've worked hard to
348520	354920	give up these ideas of properties and thinking of this more in terms of description.
355800	364200	So contextuality, in this case, becomes a little less mysterious, the context of the, or the details
364200	371400	of the interaction matter. And, and of course, what you are going to, how you are going to describe
371400	378760	in interaction depends on the details of those interactions. And descriptions need not be
379480	387000	commensurate. You can have complementarity. The electron doesn't simultaneously possess a momentum
387000	392360	and a position the electron doesn't possess either. That's a bad way of thinking.
395640	401800	So, so what this does is it gives you a bit of freedom, which is, which is interesting. And, and
402600	410920	the profitability of such a perspective then is measured by what it allows you to do. And, and
411480	423080	we've found that it allows you to, to actually do quite a bit. So if you're going to assign numbers to,
425320	431000	to objects or properties of objects or interactions between objects and, and probes,
431800	437560	or observers, then you need to do so consistently. And that's the question becomes,
437560	448920	how does one consistently assign quantities? So, so different operators may have different
448920	455720	frequencies and, or I'm sorry, may have different symmetries. And these symmetries
455720	460920	can be quite important because they will constrain the number of ways in which you can
460920	469720	assign numbers to things. So let's say I have two sets of candy taffy here. And I'm using candy
469720	475320	because what I'm going to be doing with these, these taffy is, is rather simple. You've all known
475320	482920	about this since you were kids. So I've got a set here A of some taffy and I've got a set B of some
482920	489320	taffy. And I'm going to combine the two. So let's say I've set A in one hand and set B on the other
489320	499240	hand and I'm going to put them together. Now, if I want to quantify these sets, basically assign
499240	507080	numbers to the, the, the sets of taffy, one way obvious way to do this that you're very familiar
507080	512040	with is to count them. We'll assign a number describing the cardinality of the set.
512040	522200	And one can then ask the question, well, how do you take the number that you assign to set A
523320	529880	and the number that you assign to set B? And how do you combine those numbers to arrive at the,
530440	536520	a consistent number that you're going to assign for set A with B? Of course, you all know the
536520	544520	answer to this already. You add them. And my interest in this question came from the deeper
544520	550040	question that I had in graduate school, which was, why, why do you add them? And I know that it works.
550040	555640	It's obvious that it works. I've been doing this since I was a kid. But why is that the case?
555640	559560	Can you prove that it has to be that way? And indeed you can.
560040	569720	There's several different properties that this with operator, basically combining stuff in two hands
572200	579400	exhibits this, this, this combination property with exhibits closure in this case. So if I take
579400	585240	stuff A and combine it with stuff B, the stuff that I have in A with B are the same kinds of
585240	590120	stuff. If I take taffy in my left hand and taffy my right hand and combine them, then I still have
590120	602520	a bunch of taffy. So that's closure. Another symmetry that you have with this operator is the,
604360	610680	is commutivity. Doesn't matter which hand I have set A of taffy and which hand I use to pick up
610680	615720	the sets in the first place. I could switch hands and I still have the same result when I combine
615720	623560	them. That's a symmetry. If I have three piles of taffy and I start picking them up,
624840	631000	I can pick them up in various ways. And the result is equivalent. That's called associativity.
631800	643000	And the idea is that the with operator is such that I can keep grabbing piles of taffy if I want.
643000	646280	And so mathematically I ought to be able to keep combining them.
649160	653880	So these are the four conditions that the with operator has to satisfy.
655720	660280	You can prove, this is a theorem, you can prove that if the with operator satisfies
660280	666360	these four conditions. And you can think of associative commutivity as just shuffling.
666360	674200	I can shuffle up the piles and I get the same result. Then you can show that if you're going
674200	680360	to quantify the set A with a number representative of lowercase A, and you're going to quantify the
680360	688920	set B with a number given by lowercase B, then A with B is basically going to have to be quantified
688920	696520	by something that's isomorphic to A plus B. And that's a theorem. That's something you can prove.
696520	703400	So you might say great. That's something we've known this all along. Not very exciting. I've
703400	709960	known this since I was three years old. But it turns out it's rather profound.
710520	722600	And so here's the example. If I assign number A of three to the set A, I assign 10 to set B
722600	729240	and a little taffy hiding under this one. So now when I combine them, the number that I assigned
729240	735000	to the set A with B is given by three plus 10 or 13. And that will give me a consistent
735560	737720	means of quantifying these objects.
740680	745560	So how well does this work in general? Well, it works pretty well in general. We use it all the time.
748920	755480	We count all sorts of things from taffy and rocks to gallons of gasoline to cars on the
755480	763320	highway to stars in the sky. But let me give you an example where it doesn't quite work.
764120	769560	Because one might be led by because of the generality of the application of the mathematics,
769560	773480	you may be led to thinking that this is some kind of universal physical law.
775160	781160	And it's not quite that simple. This is a description. I can emphasize the fact that
781160	790920	it's a description by showing that it is observer dependent. So here's another example. I have two
790920	797640	sets of objects. Each of these sets contains molecules. And the ones on the left, I have
798600	804360	two butane molecules. And in the set on the right, I have 13 oxygen molecules.
806760	815160	This is in the way on my screen. So now I'm going to combine the two. So on the left, I have
815240	822120	two molecules. You can see I'm assigning this in number two. On the right, I have 13 molecules.
822120	827480	I give it the number 13. And I'm going to combine them. And you expect to have 15 molecules, which
827480	835640	is nice. And that works as long as you don't shake this up and make it too hot. Once you make it too
835640	846520	hot, this happens. And you no longer have 15, you have 18. And you have 18 carbon dioxide
846520	854600	molecules and water molecules, both. So what went wrong with our little rule of additivity?
855480	861320	In this case, oh, two. It should be two plus. Now you have the numbers up here wrong.
862200	873640	But our two plus 13 actually gives me 18. So why did that happen? What went wrong?
874840	883160	The answer is quite simple. What went wrong is we violated one of the conditions for the
883160	893320	width operator. The width operator lacks closure. You don't have the same kind of stuff at the end
893320	902440	that you had in the beginning. So whether addition worked or not depended on our description.
902440	908680	If I were to go back here to the beginning, and instead of assigning, instead of counting out
908680	915560	molecules, if I counted how many atoms I had, and here I have four times two, which is eight,
915560	923000	and then 10. So that's 20. So I got 28 atoms on the left. And I have 26 atoms on the right.
923000	928440	And now I throw them together and shake up the box. I still have the same number of atoms.
930280	934360	You can add the number of atoms and you get the right result. So
934680	940840	addition works if you count the atoms, but it doesn't work if you count the molecules.
941960	948280	So that shows that there is a dependence on the level of description that you choose.
949080	955800	So whether additivity works depends on the description you chose. And the laws of nature
955800	962120	shouldn't depend on description if they're going to be some universal law. So this isn't about a law
962120	973880	of nature. This is about describing things with numbers. So of course, there are other
973880	980280	operations you can do. You can take three copies of the set A. And I'll call that three of A.
981000	989320	So this is a new operator called of. I can replicate things. And it turns out this of operator
990280	996120	is obeys associativity. And the of operator is
998760	1003880	distributes across the width operator. So you have distributivity. So here we have
1004440	1011880	associativity and distributivity. And you can prove, again, similar to the proof before,
1011880	1017320	the associativity means that the number that I assign to, so if I assign a number to,
1018040	1022920	if I have this number A, and I assign a number to B, a little A and little B,
1022920	1029480	then the number that I assign to A of B is going to have to be, is going to be some function of
1029480	1035800	little A and little B. And associativity forces that to be isomorphic to addition.
1037240	1044440	But because we used addition for the width operator, the fact that we have distributivity
1044520	1052840	forces that isomorphism to settle on one particular, once particular transform,
1052840	1058280	which is basically multiplication. So multiplication is isomorphic to addition,
1058280	1063320	so it satisfies the associativity, and the multiplication will satisfy the distributivity.
1063320	1068760	So this is a theorem. And so the idea is you multiply the numbers together.
1069720	1076840	So now when I take three of A, if I assign a number three to A, kind of unfortunately I use
1076840	1083480	three here, basically when I'm done, three of A is going to give me three times three or nine
1083480	1090200	pieces of taffy. And you can prove that this has to be the case because of associativity and
1090200	1100280	distributivity. So these are rules, rules for consistently quantifying numbers or quantifying
1100280	1106360	things with numbers. And now we're going to push this to an extreme.
1108760	1115480	We're going to consider the case that's that we encounter in quantum mechanics where we are
1115480	1121800	studying very small objects with very small objects. There are, there's a point where we
1121800	1128520	get to where we are studying objects for which there are no smaller probes by which we can use
1128520	1138520	to study these. And we may obtain some number x in a measurement, and which we would use to
1138520	1144040	quantify this interaction. But we have to acknowledge that we're going to have some
1144040	1149000	uncertainty as to the value of this assigned quantity x. You can also think of it this way,
1149000	1154520	we have some quantity describing the system, some describing the probe. So you put the two together,
1154520	1159720	you really need two numbers to describe the interaction between the system and the probe.
1160360	1168680	Now this, this uncertainty, the relationship may be more intimate than the usual x plus or minus
1168680	1174200	sigma uncertainty that we're used to from dealing with Gaussian probabilities and probability theory.
1175240	1182440	And instead, and in fact, I would like to, in this case, if I did want to quantify
1182440	1189640	things this way, I would have to derive this plus or minus as, as being a function relating
1189640	1195000	these two. So to back up and work to do something like that, we're going to not assume that this
1195080	1201480	is the case. Instead, we're going to assign two numbers here. One number is related to the
1202920	1208040	a number quantifying the interaction x and another is going to x one and say, and the other is going
1208040	1212200	to be x two, which will quantify uncertainty. We just have two numbers here instead of one.
1213160	1221000	So what happens when we consider similar operations like the width operator and the
1221000	1226760	of operator, and we start combining things, and we are using two numbers to describe
1227560	1239000	these interactions rather than just one. So we'll look at associative commutivity again,
1239000	1245000	which previously was scalars gave in the taffy gave us a sum rule. We find that that's the
1245000	1251400	case here as well. So if we have some set a something a that's described by two numbers x
1251400	1257880	one and x two, and then we have a B described by two numbers y one and y two, then a with B,
1258520	1265880	where this width operator is any operator that exhibits closure, associative commutivity and
1266600	1273880	reproducibility, then a with B has to be represented up to isomorphism by component wise
1273880	1281480	summation. So we would then assign for a with B, we would assign numbers x one plus y one is one
1281480	1290520	number and x two plus y two is the second number. That's not so unusual is it's not so different
1290520	1296120	than you can see the scalar case right there. Things get a little more interesting when you
1296680	1303320	when you consider operator an additional operation like the of operator, where you have
1303320	1313560	associative distributivity as well. So here, upon interaction associative distributivity, which
1313560	1320840	we'll use this operator as dot, is we're trying to figure out what dot would would be. We should
1321640	1327320	we should have we will have distributivity here we also have associativity and
1329640	1336120	and we also have that we have component wise summation for the plus here. And that requires
1336120	1344120	that this dot operation has to be bilinear. So whatever numbers x and y you have in the original
1344200	1353320	pairs. The result is when you combine them has got to be some some linear bilinear combination
1353320	1359480	of these objects where these gammas here are our coefficients that we have to identify.
1361160	1367560	So these basic symmetry these symmetries are common in the systems that we work with and
1367560	1377320	that is why we use addition of the time because we have associative commutivity holds often so
1377320	1384280	addition works. And in physics, generally we have associative commutivity and associative
1384280	1392280	distributivity. And that is why physics is fundamentally linear. Excuse me.
1393000	1398680	So now, whereas scalar quantification resulted in one multiplication rule, the pairwise
1398680	1406360	quantification where we're carrying with us a number quantifying some uncertainty results
1406360	1409720	in three multiplication rules, which is interesting.
1413240	1420280	So in that they these come about from looking and seeing what gammas are possible. So it turns
1421240	1431720	out that there are three sets of gammas that are are possible. And they all the different versions
1431720	1437400	reduced to three different types of operations. One of these here you'll see the first one a
1438200	1444760	looks like complex multiplication. So you're basically treating these as complex numbers.
1445480	1455320	And B is is similar, but where we have addition here. And C C is also similar, but not the same.
1456520	1466520	We can rewrite this as this as a multiple as a matrix operation, where a looks like this,
1466520	1470920	B looks like that and that and then we operate on the vector y one, y two.
1471160	1480520	So these are the three different multiplicative operators that we have. And we will see that
1480520	1490200	much of physics comes from these three operators. So without loss of generality, we set the determinant
1490200	1495560	of these operators to one. And we do that so that repeated application doesn't diverge to infinity
1495560	1501480	or collapse to zero. That would be pointless. And that means that there's really only one free
1501480	1509080	parameter related to the ratio of x two to x one, which gives us three possibilities. We have
1509080	1516840	something like a rotation matrix for multiplication rule a, we have something like a hyperbolic
1516840	1522280	rotation for multiplication rule B. And we have this other
1524920	1532920	matrix for operation C. Each one, each of these three will obey the symmetry. So they
1534440	1540680	may be useful in quantifying things in the real world that obey the symmetries or interactions
1540680	1547960	in the real world that obey the symmetries. So we, of course, we can write these operators in
1547960	1553000	terms of infinitesimal generators. This is what the generators look like. And
1556120	1563320	we then see that generator a is basically rotation by some phase angle
1564840	1570360	and which is what I had originally said. So there's a rotation matrix. So generator a basically
1570440	1577960	rotates by a phase angle and the sum and product rules in these case are those of complex arithmetic
1577960	1585320	and the pairs are complex numbers. Unit quantities identified with unit modulus determinant, which
1585320	1595480	is modulus squared. And we find that the inherent uncertainty in a unit object refers to what is
1595480	1602760	remains unidentified in X, which is namely the phase, this rotation so that
1603480	1609480	every time we have an interaction, each new object you interact with brings with it an unknown phase.
1612360	1619560	So now we have to rely on probability to deal with this inherent uncertainty properly.
1620200	1625080	Our ignorance of phase is uniformly distributed. So we can assign a prior probability to the phase
1625080	1633160	1 over 2 pi. And to obtain the likelihood of a given outcome, which is what we're quantum,
1633160	1638760	which is what we're computing when we do quantum mechanics, we must marginalize over all of the
1638760	1644120	unknown parameters, which are all of the unknown phases and the interactions. And if we perform
1644120	1652360	this marginalization, you see that we're basically summing modulus squared quantities. And this is
1652360	1659160	really why quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory. And the likelihood is additive because
1659160	1665400	of the scalar sum rule, and it depends on the modulus squared, which is the Born rule. So you
1665400	1676680	can show that all of these things arise from these simple symmetries. So here you can see,
1677400	1681240	here it looks like the foundation of quantum theory is pretty elementary and simple.
1681960	1687640	Quantity and uncertainty fused together into complex numbers with uncertainty really referring
1687640	1693640	to phase. And the observable quantity is the modulus squared, which is the Born rule for
1693640	1701880	arbitrary amount, and that represents ensemble averages, which is what the experimenter measures.
1707640	1714280	So we have that, what's nice about this is quantum mechanics and probability theory are
1714280	1720840	derived from the same symmetries that can't possibly contradict one another for that reason.
1721480	1728120	And in physics, we make predictions, which are quantified probabilistically in terms of
1728120	1737000	likelihoods. And so given those likelihoods, Bayesian analysis then computes posterior
1737000	1742200	probabilities, which assess the models and the lights in light of the outcomes that are actually
1742200	1747320	observed. And that is the relationship between quantum mechanics and Bayesian inference.
1747320	1754120	Quantum mechanics deals with computing likelihoods, and likelihoods are used in performing inference.
1754760	1764040	So now we can go a bit further and see how the multiplication rule B comes into play. These
1765640	1771880	three different rules are potentially going to be used to describe different types of interactions.
1772840	1778280	And so rule A, multiplication rule E, A we see is used in quantum mechanics.
1779000	1786040	What is B good for? Well, B, because these are all possible descriptions, we can then ask what
1786040	1792040	could be possibly described with B or C. They're going to be consistent with the symmetry, so they
1793080	1799800	would be good descriptions of something. And I'll look into that briefly here.
1801160	1805720	So here we can consider objects that can exist in two states, let's say up and down.
1806680	1810440	This gives us a quantification consisting of a pair of complex numbers,
1813400	1820600	basically using the rules A, the multiplication rule A, and we'll have pairs of complex numbers now.
1820600	1827480	And qubits, we'll call these qubits, will obey associative distributivity. So the representation
1827560	1836360	is two-dimensional over the complex field. And these generators, these generators that we have
1836360	1844120	will give us the polymatrices. So B, the generator for multiplication rule B gives you sigma x,
1845080	1850360	I times the generator for multiplication rule A gives you sigma y, and then together
1851640	1855800	B times A gives you sigma z. So these are the polymatrices.
1858440	1865400	And so the multiplication rules A and B together give you the concept of spin.
1867400	1876120	And we see that we get the scalar quantifications come from these different, these three polymatrices.
1877320	1883160	And this gives us a relationship between these new quantifications that we can construct from
1883160	1888920	these operators. And this is really the first clue that 3 plus 1 spacetime emerges from quantum
1888920	1898600	mechanics. So with complex coefficients, these generators define the six-parameter Lorentz group,
1899480	1905240	under which ensemble averages of independent samples results in this relationship, which is
1905240	1914120	invariant, or this quantity, which is invariant. So if we go back to those original multiplication
1914120	1920520	rules, these two here together basically give us a six-parameter Lorentz group.
1922520	1931800	So we can see that when you think of these multiplication rules as being constraints that
1931800	1939160	constrain your description of things, you can see that the descriptions we use in physics are
1939160	1947640	actually coming from these constraints, and they ought to be. It gives you the possibility of
1947640	1955000	deriving physics, which is quite interesting. One could have potentially derived physics before
1955000	1962120	encountering the physical world, which is quite a thought when you imagine that the
1962120	1967640	physical laws are somehow laws dictated by mother nature. If you think of the physical laws as being
1967640	1976840	constrained equations that constrain any attempts at quantifying physical things, then it's not so
1976840	1984760	surprising. So the shift in perspective on what you mean by a physical law gives you a great
1984760	1998920	deal of freedom. So we now have these symmetries of associativity, commutativity,
1998920	2004280	and associative distributivity, along with consideration of uncertainty, give us the basic
2004280	2012920	mathematical descriptions of the universe. We get from this, you can get the quantum mechanics
2012920	2023560	as a probabilistic theory. The polymatrices and spin derive from multiplication rules A and B.
2023560	2030360	This also gives you concepts of energy and momentum and phase and action. And from that,
2030360	2036120	you can then integrate using rule C, which I don't have a slide for. I should have made that.
2036200	2044200	I didn't want this to take too long. And you can see that operator C is an integrator.
2044840	2051320	I'll go back to that. Here we go. So here's operator C. If you imagine multiplying at times
2052840	2060920	something like dt on the top and then t0 down below, you can see that this is going to basically
2061000	2070680	integrate phase. So time, it comes about from integrating phase. And this basically allows
2070680	2076600	you to integrate time, which then when combined with the other to allow you to integrate,
2078920	2086440	integrate, you can integrate phase up to obtain time and you can integrate momentum in the other two
2086440	2094600	up to obtaining positions. So it works backwards from what we're used to. What we're used to is we
2095240	2103480	start out with wave functions and we have positions and times and we take derivatives to obtain
2104760	2110280	energy and momentum, which are supposedly more fundamental. So we basically work backwards
2111080	2117800	in the traditional way. We start out with something higher level, position and momentum and position
2117800	2124040	and time and we take derivatives to get momentum and energy. This is actually going from the ground
2124040	2129880	up, which is what I think would be a better foundation. That's how you build things from the
2129880	2137160	bottom up. So here basically we have energy and momentum and phase coming in from the beginning
2137880	2145880	and then with operator C, you can then integrate that to getting a three-dimensional spacetime
2146840	2151160	and that comes out as an integral of phase and energy and momentum.
2154680	2162600	So this is the direction our work has taken and why does mathematics work, which is a question
2162600	2173160	that's always had me wonder. Here it's easy to see the symmetries. These symmetries constrain
2173160	2179400	our mathematical description of physics, which is why it works and that's why it's derivable,
2179960	2190600	which is interesting. Universes can't just do anything. As long as you have these symmetries
2190600	2196680	hold, then your description of systems or interactions that obey these symmetries are
2196680	2201800	going to have to follow these mathematics and that basically is the theorem.
2203880	2210040	So here's one of our most recent papers on this, so I hope you enjoy that and thank you.
2210840	2221000	Okay. Thank you very much, Kevin, for this nice talk. The people who want to make a question or a
2221000	2236920	comment can indicate it in the chat. I have a little question. Do you think that this analysis can be
2236920	2246840	replicated in another physical theories that use another type of space or spacetime?
2253240	2257480	Oh, I didn't quite follow that. I'm sorry. The connection wasn't so good for me.
2258440	2267800	Oh, sorry. Do you think that this analysis can be replicated in another theories that
2267800	2277640	use another kind of spacetime like in the string theories? No, that's a good question and that's
2277640	2285480	basically where we're headed with this is we want to see it from what we have so far. It looks like
2285480	2294440	these symmetries allow you to generate spacetime as integrals of more fundamental quantities like
2294440	2300120	phase and energy and momentum and so we want to look into that to see if you can build spacetime
2300120	2306840	up from that foundation and if you build spacetime that way, if you can do that, then it's going to
2307400	2313400	automatically be consistent with quantum theory. So we would have a theory of spacetime that's
2313400	2317400	consistent with quantum mechanics from the get go, which is really how you would want it.
2321560	2331320	There's a question from Erika Holi. Hi, Kevin. Thanks for this from this talk. Yeah, it's great.
2331320	2337960	So I wanted to know what's your take on photons because you mentioned that when you count atoms
2337960	2344280	and molecules, well, that the counting, it depends on the level of description that you are taking,
2344280	2352280	right? But then if I have a laser, an attenuated laser, and you prepare a coherent state,
2352280	2358840	then you will have a superposition of different numbers of photons. So you don't have a definite
2358840	2365720	particle number. So what would be your take in that situation? How many photons do I have or
2365720	2372760	photons in that case will not be real entities and only the quantum field? What would be your take?
2373480	2376120	Oh, that's a really good question. That's something I hadn't considered.
2378920	2387560	If additivity doesn't work, then you've violated one of those four conditions and that would be my
2388520	2398200	first guess. Then the question would be which of the conditions are violated in that situation.
2399960	2405880	So in the case where I combine butane molecules with oxygen molecules, the condition that's
2405880	2413000	violated is that of closure. So it's hard to imagine that you're going to have a problem
2413000	2419400	with closure when combining photons. So yeah, so I'm curious about this. I'll have to think about
2419400	2431080	that. Thank you. That's a very good question. Thanks. Okay, we are in time. So thank you, Kevin.
2432280	2433160	Okay, thank you so much.
