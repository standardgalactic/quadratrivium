1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, thank you for the invitation. It is a pleasure to be here. I have been presented in my works in this series of conference since 2017, I think, and it is a pleasure to continue to present my work here.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So,

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
first I want to present my collaborators that are part of the organizers in this conference.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Professor Gustavo MartÃ­n Bozic, and Mariela Portesi, that are from the University of La Plata, and Steve Sosor, that is from France.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And you can see our work that starts, this collaboration started in the first conference that attend in this series, and, well, it's in the archive, and this is the work.

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, I want to take the title of this conference that said that 10 irreversible years on quantum foundation in Argentina.

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I want to give you a brief motivation of our work that is based on a quantum.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So,

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:07,000
quantum irreversible thermodynamics. In quantum irreversible thermodynamics, the main goal that

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the people want to achieve is how to describe in an arbitrary open quantum evolution, the rate of change of the von Neumann entropy, and

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:43,000
based on in thermodynamics way of thinking, this rate of change is splitting in two parts. One is the rate of change of the production.

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And the other is the rate of change of the entropy flux.

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The second law of thermodynamics is just the statement that the first part, that is the rate of change of entropy production is always a positive or zero.

14
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There is a big open question, which is the general way to do this is splitting in a general open quantum evolution, but the problem is solved in several cases.

15
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And this type of analysis gives a clue of how to analyze the stationary situation like equilibrium situations in open quantum evolutions.

16
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
For example, the stationary situation is the balance between these two terms here.

17
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And when the balance occurs, but also each of these terms is zero, this corresponds to thermal equilibrium. Okay.

18
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But I want to present here an alternative way to, at least in a particular kind of open quantum evolution, but very important kind.

19
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And I will present another splitting of the rate of change of the von Neumann entropy that is associated with the notions of fluctuation and dissipation, and this new splitting

20
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
allows to analyze the stationary situations in a different way.

21
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So this is the main motivation of our work.

22
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And as I will, I will introduce, which is a notion of fluctuation and dissipation in classical market processes.

23
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will talk about the additive noisy Gaussian channel and how to generalize this very important channel in classical information theory to a more general channel that the general Gaussian channel.

24
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So we start to talk about quantum open quantum dynamics, and how to describe a memory less quantum communication channels that are continuous in time.

25
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And all of these kind of memory less quantum channels, continuous in time are described by a one parameter quantum dynamical semi groups.

26
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then I will present the main result of our work that is a new

27
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
composition of the infinitesimal generator.

28
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Non-unitary infinitesimal generator associated with this one parameter quantum semi groups that verifies a link blood type of master equation.

29
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Then I will show how this decomposition infinitesimal generator

30
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:43,000
allows to write the rate of change of the von Neumann entropy in a particular way, where you can identify the fluctuation dissipation terms.

31
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And this is the quantum and a lot of the classical a very well known, the breaching identity that appears here in classical market process.

32
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And then I will compare our approach with the approach of the thermodynamics in terms of dynamics.

33
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And I will give an example in a one parameter channel quantum Gaussian channels.

34
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Well, so let's start with a noisy fluctuation classical information theory.

35
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The most important type of channel here is the additive noise Gaussian channel.

36
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That corresponds appears in embedding natural random processes and that has that are view as a large sum of noises sources of noises.

37
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If you combine this with the central limit theorem.

38
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You end up with this type of channels.

39
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So the channel is is you have a random variable, and you combine with a noise that is described by a normal distribution random viable.

40
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And this square root of t is the strength of this noise.

41
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay, so the probability distribution of the random variable at the output of the channel verifies the very well known heat equation.

42
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So, the quantification of the of the fluctuation or noise in this channel is given by the original the classical a debris debris identity that was approved for by a stamp in 1959.

43
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And it's the rate of change of the channel entropy here.

44
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And this rate of change is proportional to the efficient information.

45
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This efficient information is the so called efficient information associated with displacement, where you can.

46
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This displacement depends like any efficient information by a parameter tita but this parameter because he's at this placement.

47
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And this appears and this type of efficient information is also known as an parameter efficient information.

48
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And this quantity is always positive. So this classical debris identity only says that the fact that this random variable because becomes more random as time increase.

49
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay.

50
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The generalization of this type of channels in classical information theory is given by the so called a focal plant channels that correspond to multi dimensional channels that are modeled by lunch on forces.

51
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
These are described by a stochastic differential equation.

52
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And the more important type of these channels are the so called a general Gaussian classical channels that correspond to Einstein, you'll impact processes.

53
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The processes are described by this stochastic equation. The first term is the drift vector.

54
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Here, this x is a vector that is the multi dimensional random variables.

55
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And the second term of the differential question is the standard binary process that is characterized by this matter here that is known as the matrix of lunch on forces.

56
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The probability distribution of associated with this vector of random variables, verifies a linear focus on equation. Here is the linear from the equation.

57
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Where the first time is the drift turn on the second one is the diffusion term that is characterized by this matrix D that is written in this way with this matrix of lunch on forces.

58
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:57,000
In the case, for example, when this random variable x is just a phase space variable in a classical mechanical system.

59
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The typical example of in this case is the description of their classical Brownian motion that is given by this focus on equation with this space space variables.

60
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The quantification of fluctuation and dissipation associated with this focus on equation is given by these generalizing classical everything that it was first written with this type of approach.

61
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Information theoretical approach in in 2017 by what we will be so no show a lot.

62
00:12:44,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And this is the brewing a identity. The first time is the contribution of the fluctuation here appears the diffusion matrix and this diffusion and also the matrix of fishing information.

63
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And the second term is the contribution of dissipation. The first time is always positive could not be zero.

64
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And the second time could be a positive negative or.

65
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay.

66
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:33,000
In the case where you don't have a matrix one dimension, you recover the other discussion notes that we already see. Okay.

67
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So, let's take a more deep loop at this structure of the generalize the classical the green identity. Okay, so the diffusion matrix is written in terms of this matrix of lunch on forces.

68
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And because this matrix is a semi definite the finite positive.

69
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You can write in this way.

70
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Using the columns of the of the matrix of lunch event forces.

71
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Of course this the composition is not unique, you can use any lunch on forces that are all described in this way.

72
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If the columns of the of the matrix sigma here is a less than the nation of the of the random system, then the lunch on forces are linearly independent, and if you have more columns are the lunch on forces are not linearly independent.

73
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But all this, if you fix the, you can, you can choose any description in terms of functional forces that for a given the.

74
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So, using this the composition here, it is easy to see that this trace of this matrices here can be written in terms of the classical future information associated with the displacement probability distribution, and this placement is given by this a lunch on forces.

75
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Okay.

76
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah.

77
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:01,000
For the second time this is the drift matters here.

78
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You have a.

79
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You can decompose this drift term here as a two type of forces, one is the anti symmetric part of the matrix that correspond to conservative forces and the symmetric part that do not conservative forces.

80
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And it is easy to see that the conservative forces don't give any contribution here, and because are anti symmetric.

81
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And this trace here is just the average flux of the disability force.

82
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That gives the total amount of change of the probability distribution in the direction of minus the physical force. Okay.

83
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So, here you have a, for example, a good explanation of how the, the stationary situation, of course, because in the stationary situation this contribution of the, of the situation, mass, a, a,

84
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
in the counterbalance, these average flows of the disability force.

85
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So, let's.

86
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Now, we want to apply this ideas that appears in in classical and modern processes.

87
00:17:42,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So, let's start talking about in general, what is a quantum channel, a quantum communication channel is just a map input output math that correspond to quantum mechanical operations.

88
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And in the shooting a picture correspond to maps that are completely positive and specific serving that act on density matrix here, and are very specific.

89
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:32,000
In the has a picture this map can be described by an super operator that a present identity.

90
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The picture has sent a picture, the preservation of the, of the density of the trace of the density matrix in the has a picture correspond to the preservation of the date.

91
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Okay, this will be important.

92
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:15,000
In general, quantum channels, quantum communication channels are forms semi groups. If you compose a quantum channels, you have another quantum channel, and you have always a direction of time in this composition so it forms a semi group.

93
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Quantum channels have an inverse only when are described by a unitary evolution. Okay, so the most common situation is always you have a situation where the environment affects the evolution.

94
00:19:39,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So, the most common situation is to have a non unitary quantum channels, and this a non unitary quantum channels gives the gradation of information during, during their use, and in order to describe this degradation.

95
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And to include some information about your implementation of the channel, and this gives the necessity to use maps that are continuous in time.

96
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And when you use this type of maps to describe the situation the particular situation that you have, if you want to describe a memory less quantum channels.

97
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You end up with an evolution that is describing always by the time independent Markovian master equation, and whose solution are one parameter semi groups.

98
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So let's use this type of open quantum evolution to apply our ideas.

99
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And here you have a link that master equation in general.

100
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And these are L are the link that operators and the solution is given by this map here that this a dissolution.

101
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And this in fit final dimension, always produce a type of type of evolution, and known as a one parameter quantum in a mechanism groups.

102
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And this is also the case for the very important channels in continuous viral system.

103
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That are that correspond with a to linear master equation that I, that I will show you in a minute.

104
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So the infinitesimal propagator of this, the question, it has two parts.

105
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The first one is the infinitesimal propagation associated with the unit evolution.

106
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And the second is the asset with the knowledge.

107
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So, we answer to this question that which is the general structure of the application dissipation one parameter quantum dynamical same group in general.

108
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So, our answer is the following, which we found that the infinitesimal generator of the non-unitary evolution can be split in this way.

109
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Here appears a three super operators here are written.

110
00:22:48,000 --> 00:23:06,000
These super operators in terms of the link blood operators where we use for the link blood operators, the usual decomposition in in this real and imaginary a part of the of the

111
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
unitary a link blood operators.

112
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So the first, the L one that appear here, all these super operators are real.

113
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It means that maps are meeting operators in a meeting operators.

114
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
L one is also self adjoint with respect to the.

115
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Schmitt.

116
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's kind of product. Okay.

117
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And this.

118
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Open cell up self adjoint operator.

119
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I verify this, and this means that the map.

120
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That if you use only this as a, as a infinitesimal generator.

121
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The solution that you find here is a possible.

122
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The other two, and two here, and three that combining in this way.

123
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The other two is self adjoint L three is anti symmetric.

124
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And the combinations of both also gives a, the, a possible infinitesimal generator one to the American senate loop in itself.

125
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
This is a composition.

126
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It is very well known that the link blood operators verifies some symmetries.

127
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The first symmetry that must be verified by the link blood operators is this one where you can apply any unitary matrix here to the link blood operators to obtain another link blood operators.

128
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That describe the same system.

129
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Okay.

130
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Under this symmetry.

131
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
This, the composition are in barrier. Okay.

132
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So, it's not affected by this type of.

133
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The other symmetry that the link blood operators must verify is this one, while you change the link blood operators in this way.

134
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And also, the unit that apart in this way.

135
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Okay, well, the link blood operators appears in this Hamiltonian here.

136
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:14,000
If you apply this symmetry to our composition you see that L one and two are invalid and F three only a change but in a, in a unit that the way.

137
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So, this means that appears only a contribution that this unit any.

138
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
A society with this Hamiltonian age.

139
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Line here.

140
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Okay.

141
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
H, H prime.

142
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I will show you that the first part of this composition is associated with the fluctuation contribution to the Gaussian dynamic and semi loop.

143
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And the other two to dissipation.

144
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So let's see this.

145
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Okay.

146
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Here we have the unitary part, the non unitary. Okay, and these are our decomposition. Okay.

147
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So, to see how this is associated with fluctuation and dissipation.

148
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Let us calculate this.

149
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:24,000
The rate of change of the monomer entropy that can be split in this way, you were the first time is associated with the S this L one.

150
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So this delta t is minus the trace of the, of the operator that involves here.

151
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And here, you must put the self shown of L one, but because it's a, that's shown of L one, but because it's self shown appears.

152
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So this term here, using this.

153
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Well, the other time is you must put the other part.

154
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Okay.

155
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,000
This is the first part here can be a

156
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:28,000
written using this relative entropy that is written here on the second derivative with respect to this parameter theta.

157
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:45,000
When you use this type of evolution here, it is easy to see that have this structure here with respect to this double commutator that is the generator of this unitary evolution here.

158
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You can see that this type of structure appears here and appear here.

159
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So, it is easy to see that the first term, it can be written in this way.

160
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And this displacement of the quantum state is can be associated with the quantum luncheon forces.

161
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And it's very interesting to see that this a

162
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
sorry.

163
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
This diversion basis quantum fishing information. Okay.

164
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:42,000
This is related with the relative entropy in this way. So the sum of a fish quantum fishing information, a relative, a relative entropy basis.

165
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And measure the noise that this unit evolution do associated with the luncheon forces and testing the evolution.

166
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,000
There is a microphone that is open.

167
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So, if we compare this expression here with the pressure that appears in the classical Gaussian channels that we found, we see a very similar structure here.

168
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But also this is for the Shannon entropy, and this is for the one normal entropy. Okay, but you have also this part here that is the measure of the noise.

169
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
This is used in the dynamic but the luncheon forces here. Okay.

170
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:53,000
This is for classical Gaussian channels, and but this is for any one parameter quantum dynamics.

171
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So, this is the quantum debris identity for any quantum dynamics. Okay, this is our main result of our work.

172
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Let's compare how the

173
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
equilibrium appears in our description.

174
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So we can use this quantum debris identity for one parameter point on the enemy can see me loops.

175
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I use, you see that the stationer situation arise when these two terms balance because the first time is always positive.

176
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It cannot be zero.

177
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And in this situation situation, it must balance the second one. Okay.

178
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:59,000
In the case of the composition that appears in in irreversible quantum dynamics, it looks similar, but it's different. So this is not the same as this.

179
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:07,000
This is not the same as the second term is not this. Okay.

180
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And in, in the problem with this description here is that, for example, for one in general, you, you, the, the, the splitting.

181
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The expression that you have for this first time, for example, it depends on things of the environment.

182
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You can avoid this problem and have an expression only with with ingredients from from the system and not from the environment.

183
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And in quantum dynamical semi group, then this was a performance by the spawn.

184
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And this pressure is this one. Okay.

185
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And in this case, what but this only can be done, this only can be done when the quantum dynamical semi group has an stationary situation.

186
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:28,000
However, the composition is always true. You have this the composition, even if the quantum dynamical semi group do not have any stationary situation.

187
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:39,000
In this description, as I said, the stationary situation, distinguish between the stationary situation and equilibrium thermal situation.

188
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And we will see that in our description, this is possible.

189
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So, let's apply our approach to the so-called linear linear limbo master equation in one in continuous viral systems.

190
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
That are known as Gaussian dynamical semi groups in this type of open quantum evolution.

191
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:25,000
The Hamiltonian of the system is a quadratic in in the canonical conjugate operators and the limbo operators are linear in this.

192
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Okay.

193
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Yes, you have around five minutes, including the question.

194
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Okay.

195
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So, I will go quickly.

196
00:34:43,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So, in this case, in for this type of system, the description for the bigger function of the system is verified the same a poker plan equation that the classical case, but in this case, the bigger fashion could be a probability distribution or not.

197
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So, when the this bigger function correspond to Gaussian states. This is the, that are probability distribution, you have a description or the same description and the classical case.

198
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
In this case,

199
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,000
this channels preserve the guarantee, if you start with a Russian state, then you end up with a Russian state.

200
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And in the stationary situation, if you if the system has a stationary situation, the station, the state is Gaussian, and all initial states and apps in that, if you start with any state, you end up in this Gaussian state.

201
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So, let's, I want to show the quantum degree identity that we found in this case, you correspond if you apply this.

202
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:25,000
This is for any quantum dynamic assembly group, and to use the limbo equation, you end up with this quantum degree identity from Gaussian dynamic assembly groups.

203
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And if you compare a for a with a classical case, you see a very similar structure.

204
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Okay, but here's appear, for example, the, the matrix for the quantum division basis quantum information, and here appears the classical case.

205
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Okay.

206
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Well, let me.

207
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But if you, if you apply a, if you start with a Gaussian state, that is, and in this quantum identity.

208
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You can calculate the quantum division based fishing information and gives this special here.

209
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And if you compare this with the Shannon entropy, you see a very similar structure also, but in this case, this matter that appear here and this matter that appear here are connected.

210
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And you can prove this relation.

211
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So, there is a relation of the quantum division identity and the classical division entity.

212
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:06,000
When you start with Gaussian states in quantum dynamic Gaussian dynamic assembly groups.

213
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But in the case, if you analyze the situation when when you go to the equilibrium.

214
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
The equilibrium.

215
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You, you go to the equilibrium in a way that this difference here goes to zero. Okay.

216
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So, in the equilibrium, the monomer entropy, the rate of change of the monomer entropy goes to the rate of change of the Shannon entropy and goes both goes to zero.

217
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Okay.

218
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Let me show a, I will.

219
00:38:46,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I want to, to, to, to distinguish equilibrium from a situation, I don't enter in this here I don't have time, but I want to show this last transparency that shows that our the composition

220
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:32,000
of the non-unitary infinitesimal proprietor of quantum dynamic assembly group is related with the coherence, and here we have the Gaussian dynamic assembly group in continuous system.

221
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And I want to show a numerical simulation.

222
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But the here, the simulation is not associated with a quadratic Hamiltonian, because I don't.

223
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I use this from an old work on this.

224
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So the non-unitary part is the same as the Gaussian dynamic assembly group, but the unitary part is not quadratic is a nonlinear evolution.

225
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And here you will see the following if you start with, for example, with a Gaussian state that this is a coherent state.

226
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And you start this part here, this coherent state evolves here with a non-linear kikar monic oscillator.

227
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay.

228
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And you see that the binger function starts to show interference pattern.

229
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Now you, we have the non-linear, the two, the sum of the two evolution, the unitary plus the unitary that corresponds to the new unitary part of a Gaussian dynamic assembly group.

230
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And in the, at the bottom, you have the classical evolution of not a quantum evolution, and you see that are almost identical.

231
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So, in this case, we use a limit where this dissipative part is zero.

232
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
We only have this diffusion part.

233
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So, this shows that diffusion of this is associated with the coherent states.

234
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm sorry for this but we are on time.

235
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
We need to make a break before another session.
