WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.960
Perfecto.

00:01.960 --> 00:06.720
Welcome, everyone, to the third, to the fourth day

00:06.720 --> 00:10.320
of the 10 Conference of Quantum Foundations.

00:10.320 --> 00:15.120
We are glad to start this morning's session with Professor

00:15.120 --> 00:18.400
Marta Reboido from the Department of Physics

00:18.400 --> 00:21.680
of the University of La Plata and the Institute of Physics

00:21.680 --> 00:24.720
of La Plata-Ponisette.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.080
She will speak about exceptional points

00:27.080 --> 00:30.600
from a hybrid physical system.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.880
Please, go on, Marta.

00:32.880 --> 00:36.120
OK, good morning to everybody.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.280
First of all, I want to thank the organizers

00:39.280 --> 00:42.840
for letting us share our work in this nice and interesting

00:42.840 --> 00:45.280
conference on Quantum Foundations.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.960
This work has been done in collaboration

00:47.960 --> 00:50.160
with Romina RamÃ­rez and Diego Tielas

00:50.160 --> 00:53.320
from the University of La Plata.

00:53.320 --> 00:57.000
The focus of my talk is the existence

00:57.000 --> 01:03.600
of a sectional point in hybrid physical systems.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.520
I shall highlight some connections

01:06.520 --> 01:10.680
to the time evolution of the given initial prepared state

01:10.680 --> 01:19.400
and, in particular, its behavior at long intervals of time.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.520
Hybrid models are a system consisting

01:23.520 --> 01:26.520
of two or more components intended

01:26.520 --> 01:32.280
to harness the advantages and strengths of each of these

01:32.280 --> 01:34.680
components.

01:34.680 --> 01:39.000
As an example, we can think of the model proposed

01:39.000 --> 01:43.280
10 years ago by Sue et al.

01:43.280 --> 01:46.840
Consistent of a superconductive flux

01:46.840 --> 01:52.800
COVID coupled to a system of MBs, a nitrogen vacancy

01:52.800 --> 02:08.800
in diamon, this is interesting because the superconductive

02:08.800 --> 02:14.200
flux COVID can be used to model the two-level systems

02:14.200 --> 02:20.520
and to make COVID operations and due to the long time

02:20.560 --> 02:25.000
coherence time of the MBs, the MBs can be used

02:25.000 --> 02:28.360
as a memory of the system.

02:28.360 --> 02:30.680
Here is the experimental device.

02:30.680 --> 02:37.160
This is the diamon sample.

02:37.160 --> 02:42.400
And here on the top is the superconductive circuit.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.280
From the theoretical point of view,

02:44.280 --> 02:48.960
this hybrid model can be represented

02:48.960 --> 02:54.400
by Hamiltonian consisting of three terms, a COVID term,

02:54.400 --> 02:58.440
a term associated with the nitrogen vacancy system

02:58.440 --> 03:02.000
and interaction term.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.680
The superconductive flux COVID consists

03:04.680 --> 03:07.800
of an aluminum superconductive loop

03:07.800 --> 03:13.480
with three chasps on junctions and a magnetic field.

03:13.480 --> 03:17.880
And when the magnetic field is applied through the loop,

03:17.880 --> 03:21.400
the system can be modeled by a two-level Hamiltonian,

03:21.400 --> 03:28.920
where E is the energy bias, delta is the tunneling splitting,

03:28.920 --> 03:34.280
X, the operator S are related.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.360
Here should be, et cetera, the operator S

03:37.360 --> 03:44.400
is related to the half-poly matrices.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.720
And through a suitable transformation,

03:47.720 --> 03:52.520
it can be mapped to, it can be generalized.

03:52.520 --> 03:57.280
And the energies of the system are given in terms

03:57.280 --> 04:05.360
of the energy bias and the gap tunnel split.

04:05.360 --> 04:10.960
The nitrogen vacancy center is defect in the lattice,

04:10.960 --> 04:14.080
in the diamon, in the lattice of the diamon,

04:14.080 --> 04:18.600
where a carbon atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom,

04:18.600 --> 04:23.000
and its neighbor is a vacancy.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.640
This system can be modeled by the ground state of the system,

04:27.640 --> 04:30.320
is a triplet.

04:30.320 --> 04:34.120
When there is no external magnetic field applied,

04:34.120 --> 04:39.040
the two excited states of the template are degenerate

04:39.040 --> 04:41.840
and separated from the ground state

04:41.840 --> 04:50.040
an energy of 2.88 GHz.

04:50.040 --> 04:56.440
This separation energy makes this system adequate to be

04:56.440 --> 05:02.920
coupled to the superconductive class COVID.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.280
The interaction time is usually taken

05:06.280 --> 05:22.000
as the component set of the spin of the COVID

05:22.000 --> 05:27.480
times the x component of the spin of the MVs.

05:27.480 --> 05:35.360
We have modified the x component of the spins

05:35.360 --> 05:42.120
to take into account the effect of other impurities

05:42.120 --> 05:43.640
in the diamon.

05:43.640 --> 05:49.760
The more relevant are neutral nitrogen vacancy centers

05:49.760 --> 05:57.600
called P1 centers, which are responsible for the loss

05:57.600 --> 06:00.920
of coherence of the MVs.

06:00.920 --> 06:05.400
So we have introduced this term that is non-admission.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.800
If the interaction is not present

06:08.800 --> 06:13.360
and we take a system of two MVs, we

06:13.360 --> 06:21.600
have the two levels of the COVIDs and three levels

06:21.600 --> 06:25.480
for the quality coupling of the two MVs.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.120
When the interaction term is turned on,

06:28.120 --> 06:32.120
there is a splitting of the levels.

06:32.120 --> 06:36.960
And due to the fact that this term is non-admission,

06:36.960 --> 06:39.920
sign of the level can acquire a wheel.

06:39.920 --> 06:46.400
That is, the eigenvalues of the system can be complex.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.680
To understand the spectrum of the system,

06:49.720 --> 06:57.720
we can see that the adjoined Hamiltonian

06:57.720 --> 07:01.680
is the transpose of H. That means

07:01.680 --> 07:07.120
that this both Hamiltonian and this spectral operators

07:07.120 --> 07:09.840
and, in consequence, the eigenvalues are

07:09.840 --> 07:16.040
other real or complex conflict pairs.

07:16.040 --> 07:24.280
The basis can be leveled by the states of the COVIDs

07:24.280 --> 07:30.120
and the collective states of the MVs.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.920
If we let us first describe what happens

07:33.920 --> 07:37.960
with the system of one superconductive blue cube,

07:37.960 --> 07:41.680
COVID coupled to two MVs.

07:41.680 --> 07:45.720
These are the typical constants of the sector

07:46.400 --> 07:49.960
of the MVs and we shall assume that the tunneling

07:49.960 --> 07:52.760
splitting of the superconductive blue cube

07:52.760 --> 07:56.880
can be set at the value of 2D.

07:56.880 --> 08:01.040
And this a dimensional coupling is

08:01.040 --> 08:07.040
the strength of the interaction in terms of the coupling E.

08:07.040 --> 08:11.320
If we plot the eigenvalues in terms

08:11.320 --> 08:14.320
of this a dimensional coupling and in terms

08:14.320 --> 08:20.640
of the asymmetric parameter, we realize that there is a sector

08:20.640 --> 08:25.440
in the parameter model space where the eigenvalues

08:25.440 --> 08:30.240
are complex configurations.

08:30.240 --> 08:36.080
This limiting curve is the curve where

08:36.080 --> 08:38.520
exceptional points occurs.

08:38.520 --> 08:44.280
An essential point is a point in the parameter model

08:44.280 --> 08:50.280
space where the eigenvalues are coalescent

08:50.280 --> 08:52.680
and also the eigenfunctions.

08:52.680 --> 08:56.760
That is, the matrix of the system is no longer

08:56.760 --> 09:00.880
the diagonalizable.

09:00.880 --> 09:08.000
This pattern that I have plot before for the case of delta

09:08.000 --> 09:18.360
equal 2D, this small d equals 0, is this line up here.

09:18.360 --> 09:25.240
And if we now vary the value of delta over d,

09:25.240 --> 09:27.760
we found that there is a regular pattern

09:27.760 --> 09:29.880
for exceptional points in the system.

09:33.280 --> 09:36.560
To look at the time evolution of the system,

09:36.560 --> 09:40.840
we shall use the formalities of the green function.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.280
If we have the Hamiltonian, the green matter

09:43.280 --> 09:46.480
is related to the Hamiltonian in this way.

09:46.480 --> 09:50.680
And the time evolution of the system

09:50.680 --> 09:55.320
can be expressed in terms of the Fourier transform

09:55.320 --> 09:59.480
of the green matrix.

09:59.480 --> 10:02.640
The transition matrix shall be defined in terms

10:02.640 --> 10:05.520
of the Fourier transform in this way

10:05.560 --> 10:12.400
and give us the information of the transition

10:12.400 --> 10:15.280
between these states as a function of time.

10:19.920 --> 10:27.960
Here I have fixed the value of g to 0.02 GHz.

10:27.960 --> 10:36.240
And then this is the typical plot for an exceptional point

10:36.240 --> 10:37.960
in this region.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.560
The energy is real.

10:39.560 --> 10:44.560
In this region and this region, the energy is complicated.

10:44.560 --> 10:49.200
If we look at the transition probability,

10:49.200 --> 10:55.040
that is the entries of the matrix that I have defined before,

10:55.080 --> 11:01.120
for a long interval of time, in terms of alpha,

11:01.120 --> 11:04.080
we see that the transition probabilities of sun

11:04.080 --> 11:11.920
states tend to value different from 0

11:11.920 --> 11:17.520
at the time for long interval times.

11:17.520 --> 11:24.680
This is of diagonal terms and this is the diagonal terms.

11:24.680 --> 11:30.720
And in this region where the spectrum is real,

11:30.720 --> 11:35.720
here we have performed a promedius.

11:35.720 --> 11:43.800
We have promedied on two period times the results.

11:43.800 --> 11:49.080
This is where the spectrum is complex.

11:49.080 --> 11:54.280
This is the steady value of the probability.

11:57.520 --> 12:01.040
Well, what is interesting is what happened at this point

12:01.040 --> 12:03.480
where the eigenvalue of coalesce.

12:03.480 --> 12:10.040
As I have said before, for these points,

12:10.040 --> 12:19.880
we observe non-exponential k because the matrix related

12:19.880 --> 12:29.320
to the transform of the dream function

12:29.320 --> 12:34.000
has a block which corresponds to a Schoeman form

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
because the Hamiltonian at this point

12:36.000 --> 12:39.400
is no longer diagonalizable.

12:39.400 --> 12:46.120
And then the consequence of this is that the decay is no longer

12:46.120 --> 12:55.320
exponential but we have some potential of t in the spectrum.

12:55.320 --> 13:05.720
If we study the survival probability for a coherent state,

13:05.720 --> 13:10.040
for an initial state, prepare as a coherent state

13:10.040 --> 13:20.120
with azimuthal axis p over 4 times the system of the qubits

13:20.120 --> 13:27.560
in the ground state, we see that the probability,

13:27.560 --> 13:33.320
survival probability, can be written in an analytical form

13:33.320 --> 13:35.720
this way.

13:35.720 --> 13:44.600
We observe that we have a factor t square in the numerator

13:44.600 --> 13:49.320
and denominator so that, as a function of time,

13:49.320 --> 13:51.640
this will evolve to a constant.

13:52.360 --> 14:06.920
For a given initial state, prepare as an initial state

14:06.920 --> 14:11.960
of the qubits and initial state of the mbis,

14:11.960 --> 14:18.440
the evolved state is given in this way.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.080
And as I have said before, the probability,

14:21.080 --> 14:26.680
survival probability has this expression as usual.

14:26.680 --> 14:31.880
And here we show four different values of alpha,

14:31.880 --> 14:34.000
not the exceptional point.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.800
The exceptional point is this and this.

14:37.800 --> 14:44.880
How the probability behaves for a long interval of time

14:44.880 --> 14:47.200
as a function of time.

14:47.200 --> 14:52.720
We see that depending on theta, this corresponds to theta

14:52.720 --> 14:59.120
equals 0, p over 2, p over 4, and p,

14:59.120 --> 15:04.200
the survival probability of the initial state

15:04.200 --> 15:14.280
is close to 1 near the exceptional point or goes to 0.

15:14.280 --> 15:18.720
And the opposed behavior in the other exceptional point.

15:18.720 --> 15:25.920
In this branch of parameters where the values are real,

15:25.920 --> 15:31.480
these are the promedio in two periods of time.

15:34.840 --> 15:38.000
What we learn from this is that depending

15:38.000 --> 15:41.160
on the initial state, the survival probability in terms

15:41.160 --> 15:48.160
of the coupling of the asymmetric parameter

15:48.160 --> 15:53.120
is better or not.

15:53.120 --> 15:58.280
Well, let us look at the squeezing parameter.

15:58.280 --> 16:02.280
The squeezing parameter is defined

16:02.320 --> 16:11.880
as if we have a system of spins, that is, then this,

16:11.880 --> 16:15.960
for instance, and we look at the mean value of the spin

16:15.960 --> 16:20.360
and define this as the set up prime direction.

16:20.360 --> 16:25.520
Then we look in the perpendicular plane to this direction

16:25.520 --> 16:39.120
where for the small component of the deviation of x prime,

16:39.120 --> 16:43.960
that define the parameter of the squeezing of the system.

16:43.960 --> 16:49.800
And if this is reduced in the direction of x prime,

16:49.840 --> 16:58.000
sorry, this is because in the perpendicular direction,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.480
it is increased.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.560
When we look at this parameter, we

17:03.560 --> 17:09.560
observe that for the real regime of the spectrum,

17:09.560 --> 17:14.680
when the spectrum is real, the system can be squeezed.

17:14.680 --> 17:22.720
But for the points where the spectrum is complex,

17:22.720 --> 17:25.440
the system is anti-squix.

17:25.440 --> 17:30.160
In particular, there is a point here

17:30.160 --> 17:35.280
where the mean value of the spins adopt the value 0.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.760
And for this point here, of course,

17:38.760 --> 17:42.720
this parameter diverge.

17:42.720 --> 17:47.560
And perhaps it is not well defined at this point.

17:47.560 --> 17:54.200
But for this particular point, we observe the following thing.

17:54.200 --> 17:59.600
We observe that if we have an initial state prepared

17:59.600 --> 18:06.680
as a coherent state for instance with theta equal p over 2,

18:06.720 --> 18:14.040
it evolves in time to this particular state, which

18:14.040 --> 18:20.000
is composed of the superposition of two coherent states.

18:23.600 --> 18:29.160
This state was identified as a reading

18:29.160 --> 18:37.120
at the state by other workers sometime ago.

18:37.120 --> 18:45.640
So what happened is that if we prepare an initial state,

18:45.640 --> 18:54.760
in this particular cap and I will be particular asymmetry

18:54.760 --> 19:00.760
in the state, the capital interaction,

19:00.760 --> 19:09.760
will end with a reading circuit.

19:09.760 --> 19:15.320
These are the plot obtained by computing the beginner

19:15.320 --> 19:19.920
discrete function for the ease U2 model.

19:20.920 --> 19:27.920
Then we can think what happens is we compute this

19:27.920 --> 19:31.920
for a larger number of nb's.

19:31.920 --> 19:37.920
For two nb's, we have, for instance,

19:37.920 --> 19:44.920
if we value delta equal 2 times d,

19:45.920 --> 19:54.920
this curve will correspond to the appearance

19:54.920 --> 19:56.920
of the sectional point.

19:56.920 --> 20:02.920
And this curve will correspond to the appearance of cad

20:02.920 --> 20:09.920
states as steady states of the system.

20:10.920 --> 20:17.920
When we increase the number of nb's in the system

20:17.920 --> 20:25.920
and we redefine the parameter alpha as alpha over

20:25.920 --> 20:29.920
square root of m, this is a collective model.

20:29.920 --> 20:38.920
That's why the alpha should be rewritten

20:38.920 --> 20:42.920
as alpha over square root of m.

20:42.920 --> 20:52.920
We also found a regular pattern of exceptional points

20:52.920 --> 20:56.920
and a regular pattern of a reading curve

20:56.920 --> 21:02.920
cad states as steady states.

21:02.920 --> 21:06.920
Well, in conclusion, we have shown

21:06.920 --> 21:09.920
that in this type of hybrid systems,

21:09.920 --> 21:15.920
we can show the appearance of exceptional points.

21:15.920 --> 21:22.920
This is an aspect related to the non-hormitian

21:22.920 --> 21:27.920
dynamic of the system.

21:27.920 --> 21:33.920
Non-exceptional, at non, at exceptional points,

21:33.920 --> 21:40.920
we love the exponential decay.

21:40.920 --> 21:44.920
The states, which are no, the matrix,

21:44.920 --> 21:49.920
which is no longer diagonalizable,

21:49.920 --> 21:54.920
admit a normal short-term form,

21:54.920 --> 21:59.920
and then the survivor probability related

21:59.920 --> 22:03.920
to an initially even state at this point

22:03.920 --> 22:08.920
will show a polynomial behavior.

22:08.920 --> 22:12.920
The order of the polynomial corresponds to the

22:12.920 --> 22:18.920
order of the pole in the green matrix

22:18.920 --> 22:21.920
at the exceptional point.

22:21.920 --> 22:27.920
And we also show that in this type of systems,

22:27.920 --> 22:38.920
we can create as steady states a reading curve.

22:38.920 --> 22:44.920
If we now couple the system of m best

22:44.920 --> 22:48.920
to more superconducting COVID,

22:48.920 --> 22:57.920
we can expect that the structure

22:57.920 --> 23:00.920
or the coexistence of exceptional points

23:00.920 --> 23:03.920
will show a more rich behavior,

23:03.920 --> 23:06.920
and perhaps we have exceptional points

23:06.920 --> 23:11.920
of not only one pair of state coalescing

23:11.920 --> 23:13.920
to the same eigenstate,

23:13.920 --> 23:17.920
but more eigenstate coalescing to the same states.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.920
And what is an open question,

23:20.920 --> 23:25.920
there is some people working on this,

23:25.920 --> 23:29.920
is what happened with non-ormition systems

23:29.920 --> 23:32.920
at finite temperature.

23:32.920 --> 23:37.920
We have recently begun to work on this work,

23:37.920 --> 23:43.920
but I hope next year we can give some insight on this.

23:43.920 --> 23:52.920
Well, thank you very much for your attention.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.920
Thanks.

23:55.920 --> 23:58.920
Thanks Marta, thanks for this great talk.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.920
Now, if there are some questions,

24:00.920 --> 24:03.920
please write them down in the chat

24:03.920 --> 24:10.920
and I will pick them up.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.920
Sebastian, please go ahead.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.920
You can open your mic if you want.

24:17.920 --> 24:21.920
Hello Marta, thank you for your talk.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.920
I think that I know what you think,

24:24.920 --> 24:28.920
but I want to hear from you.

24:28.920 --> 24:34.920
Do you have some interpretation

24:34.920 --> 24:36.920
or conceptual interpretation

24:36.920 --> 24:42.920
of the meaning of the imaginary part of the energy?

24:42.920 --> 24:46.920
And the second part of the question is,

24:46.920 --> 24:51.920
in this formalism,

24:51.920 --> 24:56.920
change the interpretation of the energy

24:56.920 --> 25:02.920
that we know even in the real part of the energy

25:02.920 --> 25:07.920
or not is the same.

25:07.920 --> 25:12.920
What I have learned till now is that

25:12.920 --> 25:17.920
in generally the parameters

25:17.920 --> 25:22.920
leading to real spectrum,

25:22.920 --> 25:24.920
when you have real spectrum,

25:24.920 --> 25:28.920
generally you can make a similarly transformation

25:28.920 --> 25:30.920
to an Hermitian Hamiltonian,

25:30.920 --> 25:35.920
which is at a system with finite number of degrees,

25:35.920 --> 25:38.920
with finite dimension.

25:38.920 --> 25:43.920
So the part of real spectrum,

25:43.920 --> 25:46.920
I think that is almost the same

25:46.920 --> 25:48.920
as the Hermitian Hamiltonian

25:48.920 --> 25:52.920
through a similar transformation.

25:52.920 --> 25:58.920
The other sector of the model,

25:58.920 --> 26:03.920
is complex energies.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.920
Well, in finite systems,

26:06.920 --> 26:11.920
I will think of the usual concept of loss and gain,

26:11.920 --> 26:14.920
and you say, well,

26:14.920 --> 26:19.920
the eigenvalues have a negative part of the energy,

26:19.920 --> 26:21.920
of the complex energy,

26:21.920 --> 26:27.920
you are modeling a loss system,

26:27.920 --> 26:33.920
and if you in some way can add things to the system,

26:33.920 --> 26:40.920
then you have to have the positive part of the energy,

26:40.920 --> 26:43.920
of the complex energy.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.920
That is for finite systems.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.920
And this was nice.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.920
There are a lot of experiments,

26:51.920 --> 26:56.920
particularly in optical physics.

26:56.920 --> 27:00.920
I can give you some recent results,

27:00.920 --> 27:04.920
by mail, the reference.

27:04.920 --> 27:13.920
Now, the problem is with infinite dimensional systems.

27:13.920 --> 27:18.920
There we have worked out the model,

27:18.920 --> 27:21.920
I don't know if you are familiar,

27:21.920 --> 27:23.920
the model of Swanson,

27:23.920 --> 27:29.920
the simple model that has is a quadratic model of Bosons,

27:29.920 --> 27:32.920
and once after interaction,

27:32.920 --> 27:37.920
it has an stress different than the other.

27:37.920 --> 27:41.920
And it has a broken symmetric space

27:41.920 --> 27:46.920
that has complex parent values.

27:46.920 --> 27:52.920
And we have learned that with proper choice

27:52.920 --> 27:57.920
of the parameters and with adequate transformation,

27:57.920 --> 28:03.920
we can also make

28:03.920 --> 28:08.920
some relation between the Hamiltonian is a joint.

28:08.920 --> 28:12.920
But now the eigenvalues, the eigenfunctions,

28:12.920 --> 28:14.920
does not belong to the Hilbert space,

28:14.920 --> 28:17.920
because they are not square integrals.

28:17.920 --> 28:23.920
So you have to use the formalings of the Elphan template.

28:23.920 --> 28:29.920
And then, when you look at the time evolution in this case,

28:29.920 --> 28:31.920
you have to be carefully,

28:31.920 --> 28:33.920
you have to do it carefully,

28:33.920 --> 28:38.920
because it is not a resonant and anti-resonant state

28:38.920 --> 28:44.920
as stated the other day, Manuel Gadella.

28:44.920 --> 28:48.920
They are, the time rebels are one of the other,

28:48.920 --> 28:53.920
and then you have to make the evolution with the resonant states

28:53.920 --> 28:58.920
for T greater than zero

28:58.920 --> 29:05.920
and with the anti-resonant state with T less than zero.

29:05.920 --> 29:10.920
And it is, as Manuel said,

29:10.920 --> 29:17.920
it is tricky because you have to deal with,

29:17.920 --> 29:23.920
sometimes with metric operation that with similar operators

29:23.920 --> 29:26.920
that are not definitely positive define,

29:26.920 --> 29:32.920
and so you have to look at the metric and so on.

29:32.920 --> 29:36.920
There is still too much to do.

29:36.920 --> 29:41.920
A lot of things to do.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.920
Okay. Thank you, Martin.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.920
Okay. We are on time.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.920
So we thank Marta for this great talk.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.920
So we put some internet claps.
