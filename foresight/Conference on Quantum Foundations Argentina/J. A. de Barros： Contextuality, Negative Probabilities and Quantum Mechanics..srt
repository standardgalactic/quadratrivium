1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
OK, well, it's kind of like a hard task

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,160
to start after such a great talk.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,240
I didn't get the whole talk.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,280
It's the end of the semester here,

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,560
but it was very interesting what I saw,

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,400
and I'm going to sure read more about it.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,120
So what I want to talk today is about negative probabilities

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,280
in quantum mechanics, and in particular with respect

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,600
to contextuality.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,320
And I think it ties a little bit with the previous talk,

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,960
because you can think of that as a way of describing

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,520
certain quantum systems that's epistemic.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,760
But at the end of the day, my interest

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,240
is in trying to rule out some possible ontological models

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,360
as well.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,960
Anyway, so here's the outline of my talk today.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,160
I'm going to start with trying to give some motivation

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,400
about negative probabilities, and then

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,200
I'm going to talk about how is it that negative probabilities

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,760
actually come into this story through contextuality.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,320
And then after that, I'm going to give a definition

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,840
of negative probabilities that is more formal than usually one

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,680
would find.

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,480
And there is a reason for doing that,

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,960
and hopefully the motivation is going to make it clear

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,560
what is the reason.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,000
So the starting point is the realization

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,800
that quantum mechanics, as the previous speaker mentioned,

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,840
is a probability theory, in a certain sense.

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,120
So what we have in quantum mechanics

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,120
is a state for a physical system.

32
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,720
And that state is a vector in a hyperspace,

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,480
or a density matrix, whatever.

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,080
And we can use that state to infer outcomes of experiments

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,000
probabilistically.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,240
So that's what quantum theory gives us,

37
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:16,280
is this probabilistic description of physical systems.

38
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,600
However, this probabilistic description

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,400
that quantum theory gives to us is not fully compatible

40
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,240
with classical probability theory,

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,520
in the sense that for some set of observables

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,640
for a quantum system, if we look at the experimental outcomes

43
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,280
that quantum theory predicts, you cannot have a joint

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,880
probability distribution that describes all those observables

45
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,280
within classical theory.

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,480
We have kind of like a name for that.

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,680
We say that those theories are contextual.

48
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,520
And in the section about contextuality,

49
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,760
I'm going to outline a little bit more detail of what we mean

50
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,640
by that for those who are not aware of that.

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,400
Probably all of you are, but anyway.

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,600
So since we cannot describe quantum mechanics

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,000
with classic probability theory, it's

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,240
natural to ask whether we can modify classic probability theory

55
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,280
to describe quantum systems.

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,760
So is it possible that some different probability theory

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,680
can actually help us get a better understanding of what's

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
going on in these quantum systems?

59
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,360
And there are different ways to modify

60
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,240
classic probability theory.

61
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,360
One of them is, well, actually, quantum theory itself,

62
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,000
where we use a probability that's over vectors

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,360
in hybrid space.

64
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,320
And that effectively modifies probability theory,

65
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,520
in the sense that not everything is commasurable.

66
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,640
And the algebra of events that you have

67
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,360
is restricted to a lattice.

68
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,520
So you don't have the standard Boolean algebra

69
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,440
of all the events.

70
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,680
And you cannot give a measure of all the events

71
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,160
at the same time.

72
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,000
So that's one possibility is modifying

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,280
the algebra of classic probabilities,

74
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,520
because classic probabilities assumes that the events

75
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,720
form an algebra that's a Boolean algebra.

76
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,800
The other way is to modify the additivity rule.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:35,640
We know, for example, that probability theory, if two sets

78
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,120
belong to this algebra of measurable events,

79
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,960
they are compute.

80
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,760
We compute the probability of those two sets,

81
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,920
the disjoint sets.

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,960
Together, the probability of two disjoint sets

83
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,160
is the sum of those probabilities of those sets.

84
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,440
So that's the additivity rule.

85
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,760
So one of the things that we can do

86
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,760
is we can modify that additivity rule.

87
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,040
And that's something that comes out

88
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,480
of definite work on upper and lower probabilities.

89
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,720
And the other possibility is the one

90
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,000
that we're going to be following here

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,720
is to modify probabilities such that we don't restrict ourselves

92
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,160
to non-negative values.

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,320
So those are ways of extending probability theory.

94
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,080
And so when we think about negative probabilities

95
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:39,840
or probabilities where the non-negativity of probabilities

96
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,920
is denied, we need to think about it carefully.

97
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,680
And how exactly do we want to define that?

98
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,360
So what we're going to be trying to do today

99
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,760
is introduce a way to describe quantum systems that

100
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,040
violate this non-negatives, the negativeness property,

101
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:02,560
such that we have, first, a major theoretic formalism that

102
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,200
does that, and second, that we capture

103
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,280
the essence of what we want to have in quantum systems

104
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,480
and physical systems in that theory of probability.

105
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,280
So that's essentially what we want to do today.

106
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,640
So let's start with contextuality.

107
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,440
And I'm going to have a little bit

108
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,000
of a weird, non-historic approach to contextuality

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,760
that starts with a historic comment, which

110
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,080
is contextuality originated.

111
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,560
The idea of contextuality originates in language.

112
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,240
And it was well known in the 20th century

113
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,920
in works in pragmatics, for example.

114
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,000
But take the sentence, marry a student near the bank,

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,920
observing people.

116
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,120
We can understand the sentence differently,

117
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,480
depending on whether it's preceded or it's followed

118
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,840
by distinct sentences.

119
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,000
For example, take this very same sentence followed

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,760
by this statement.

121
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,600
She paused to notice a child amuse herself

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,480
with the fishes jumping in the river.

123
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,000
When we read that sentence and we read the first one

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,280
together of the second one about a child looking

125
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,900
at fishes in the river, we understand

126
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,180
that bank refers to the bank of a river.

127
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,860
But if, on the other hand, instead of this,

128
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,740
we followed marry a student near the bank,

129
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,260
with this sentence, she noticed the manager punctually

130
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,900
leaving at noon, something that would help with the heist.

131
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,980
We associate bank not with the bank of a river,

132
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,820
but we associate it with a financial institution,

133
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,860
the physical manifestation of a financial institution.

134
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:51,580
So in this example, the first sentence,

135
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,940
how we understand it, changes of the context

136
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,660
when it's put together with this child looking at fishes,

137
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,500
when it's put together with heist.

138
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,940
So that is the sense in which linguists talk

139
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,980
about contextuality of language.

140
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,180
And we can understand contextuality of language

141
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,380
in terms of a very logic approach to language, which

142
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,300
is the truth functional approach, in which propositions

143
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:28,300
are the way in which we understand meaning of sentences.

144
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,020
So like, for example, take the two propositions, A and B,

145
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,660
A being marry a student near the river bank,

146
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,460
and B being marry a student near the building

147
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,860
of a financial institution.

148
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,300
Those two sentences, they have different truth values

149
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,340
depending on the context.

150
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,540
In the context of river, A is true and B is false,

151
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,820
whereas in the context of heist, A is false and B is true.

152
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,980
So it's in this sense of truth values

153
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,140
that we can understand contextuality

154
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,980
and actually even relates contextuality in language

155
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,660
to contextuality in quantum mechanics

156
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,020
via random variables.

157
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,660
So let's look at how contextuality in this case

158
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,380
will show up in terms of random variables.

159
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,020
So we can think about those statements A and B

160
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,860
as being modeled by random variables A and B.

161
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,820
I'm going to represent them in both face here

162
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,020
just to distinguish between the statements A and B,

163
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,420
the propositions A and B. And these random variables A and B

164
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,260
modeled it by being dichotomous random variables

165
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,980
with values plus and minus one.

166
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,100
With minus one, for example, corresponding

167
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,300
to the statement being false and plus one corresponding

168
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,740
to the statement being true.

169
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,500
It's kind of like silly to think about random variables

170
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,500
for this particular example because they are not,

171
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,580
they're deterministic random variables

172
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,180
because once a statement is true,

173
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,220
A is always going to be one, right?

174
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,100
And if B is false, B is always going to be minus one.

175
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,620
So it's kind of silly to think about

176
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,540
in terms of random variables,

177
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,500
but there's nothing that forbids us from doing that.

178
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,060
And contextuality here means that there is no single

179
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,700
random variable A and B that represents those concepts

180
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,300
A and B in different contexts,

181
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,060
or represent those truth values in different contexts.

182
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,660
The reason is that a random variable is defined

183
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,180
within a probability space.

184
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,580
And the probabilities, they cannot represent

185
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,380
both A and B simultaneously.

186
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,380
So this is the contextuality that comes in linguistics.

187
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,340
It's, we can call this as a direct influence

188
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,140
of the context on the random variables

189
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,620
because the expectations of the random variables

190
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,500
change directly with the context.

191
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,260
In one context, the expectation of A is one,

192
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,380
in another context, the expectation of A is minus one.

193
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,860
So the expectation changes the context.

194
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,260
This is not what happens in physics

195
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,380
because this type of contextuality

196
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,020
would violate the signaling condition,

197
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,100
but that's a way of representing the linguistic type

198
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,860
of contextuality in terms of random variables.

199
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,660
But once we have that idea of contextuality as changing

200
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,220
the expectations of random variables

201
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,060
in, with respect to the context,

202
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,020
we kind of like have a clue of how is it

203
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,620
that we can extend that to things

204
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,380
that might be more relevant to physics.

205
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,180
So let's take a more subtle case, right?

206
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,180
Let's take three, that column was random variables x, y, and z.

207
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,960
So plus or minus one random variables.

208
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,760
And let's just assume that their expectation is zero.

209
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,240
So we don't know, it's kind of like tossing a coin

210
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,400
for x, y, and z.

211
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,080
We don't know whether it's true or false

212
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,960
every time that we observe it,

213
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,960
but they're perfectly correlated among themselves.

214
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,960
So x is perfectly anti-correlated with y,

215
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,240
x is perfectly anti-correlated with z,

216
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,840
and perfectly anti-correlated with z and y.

217
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,280
Z and y are perfectly anti-correlated.

218
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,440
And it's a very straightforward to see that

219
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,040
if we have such cases where x, y, x, z, and y, z

220
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,600
are anti-correlated, that there is something funky going on.

221
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,800
And the way to see there is something funky going on

222
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,280
is just to notice that, for example, if x equals one,

223
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,400
this guy here implies that y equals minus one.

224
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,600
And if x equals one, this guy here implies

225
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,040
that z equals minus one.

226
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,000
But minus one times minus one is one.

227
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,040
However, this guy here tells us that y times z is minus one,

228
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,080
which is a contradiction.

229
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,720
So there is something wrong going on.

230
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,280
And what is wrong is that when we're using this reasoning

231
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,280
of x being implying y equals minus one here

232
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,880
in this first equation, and then we're using it

233
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,640
as implying z here in this second equation,

234
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,880
and then using to get the multiplication

235
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,640
in the third equation, we're assuming

236
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,280
that all three random variables are defined together.

237
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,200
That means that we're assuming there's a joint

238
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,520
probability distribution.

239
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,720
But it doesn't exist.

240
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,200
Assuming that x in the context of y is the same

241
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,560
as x in the context of z is what's leading

242
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,280
as your contradiction, assuming that all three of them

243
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,320
are observable at the same time

244
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,800
is leading as your contradictions.

245
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,400
And we know that this happens in quantum mechanics,

246
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,800
that there are things that we cannot absorb at the same time.

247
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,600
So can we see something like that in quantum mechanics?

248
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,360
And the answer is yes.

249
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,320
A very famous example is the GHZ states.

250
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,040
We have three particles, one, two, and three,

251
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,880
that are in an entangled state where either all three

252
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,360
of them have spin in the direction z being plus,

253
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,240
or all three of them have spin in the direction z being minus,

254
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,280
and then we have a superposition of those two states.

255
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,680
And then it's easy to see that these guys

256
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,680
have the following eigenstates.

257
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,280
For example, if we measure spin of particle one

258
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,040
in the direction x, measure spin in the particle two

259
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,240
in the direction y, and three in the direction y,

260
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,360
the product of those three spins is always gonna be one.

261
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,040
In the other hand, if we measure y, x, y,

262
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,120
it's also gonna be one, y, y, x is also one,

263
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,000
but x, x, x is minus one.

264
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,320
So we can try to look at it in terms of random variables.

265
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,440
Let's say we have an x-random variable

266
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,600
for spin in the direction x, a y-random variable

267
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,440
for spin in the direction y,

268
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,000
and then we assume them to be context independent.

269
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,080
And if we do that, we can multiply this guy here,

270
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,200
the random variables corresponding to this spin,

271
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,200
x, y, y, times the spin y, x, y, times y, y, x,

272
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,280
and each one of those guys in parentheses are equal to one.

273
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,360
And when we multiply them, we can now collect

274
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,480
all the y's together and all the x's together,

275
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,400
and the square of something that's closer

276
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,160
minus one is always one.

277
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,700
And when we do that, this guy here's one,

278
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,780
and we get a contradiction that one is equal to minus one

279
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,960
from this quantum mechanical computation.

280
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,340
Of course, it's not a contradiction

281
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,460
because what we're getting as contradiction

282
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,460
is based on the assumption that the y in the context of x

283
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,740
and y, y two in the context of x one and y three

284
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,220
is the same as the y two in the context of y one and x three.

285
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,060
So in other words,

286
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,580
we're assuming a joint probability distribution.

287
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,500
So when we have a set of random variables

288
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,340
that are contextual,

289
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,340
there is no joint probability distribution

290
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,460
for all the variables.

291
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,000
There is, of course, a joint probability distribution

292
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,180
for each one of those contexts,

293
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,940
but when you put all those six random variables together,

294
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,420
there is no joint probability distribution.

295
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,220
There's no single probability space,

296
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:41,140
omega fp such that the random variables xi and yi

297
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,580
models all the quantum outcomes.

298
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,580
That's not possible in standard probability theory.

299
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,180
Of course, we know that the quantum formalism

300
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,940
provides an answer.

301
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,500
We can use the quantum formalism as we shown here

302
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,260
to compute the expectations of actual observables

303
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,940
that we can measure together,

304
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,340
but are there alternatives to quantum model?

305
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,740
And more importantly,

306
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,180
are there alternatives to the quantum model useful for us

307
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,260
to think about what's going on with the quantum case?

308
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,860
We don't know whether those alternatives are useful,

309
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,060
but we feel that perhaps understanding them better

310
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,180
might be a way to at least understand

311
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,140
what is it that they can bring to this discussion

312
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,620
of what the quantum model or quantum,

313
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,220
of what the hub or space formula is telling us.

314
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,380
So the alternatives that have been tried,

315
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,620
as I mentioned, are upper and lower probabilities,

316
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,860
and of course, there are negative probabilities

317
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,820
that we wanna expand more today.

318
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,600
So let's go into defining negative probabilities.

319
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,260
To understand how we define negative probabilities,

320
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,500
it's useful to see how we define standard probability theory.

321
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,340
Right?

322
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,020
So the most accepted definition

323
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,500
of standard probability theory is by Komagorov.

324
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,540
He gave a set theoretic definition

325
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,860
of classic probability theory as being the triplets,

326
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,860
omega Fp, where omega is a sample space that you have.

327
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,260
F is an algebra over that sample space omega

328
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,220
that is actually a sigma algebra, a countable algebra,

329
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,660
and P is a function that takes elements of this algebra

330
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,740
to this interval zero and one.

331
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,420
And the restrictions that we have for P

332
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,460
is that the measure of omega or the whole set

333
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,380
of possibilities is equal to one.

334
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,700
In other words, the probability

335
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,700
that something happens is one.

336
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,700
And the other assumption is that the additivity rule

337
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,300
holds for this function.

338
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,540
In other words, for any denumerable

339
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,940
and this joint family of elements of this algebra F, Ai,

340
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,900
the probability of A, say A1 or A2

341
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,660
is the sum of the probability of A and the probability of two.

342
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,260
So that's something that's a requirement

343
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,380
of probability theory.

344
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,820
And because this is a number between zero and one,

345
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,500
this probability is monotonic.

346
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,500
So if you have a set A, the probability of adding something

347
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,540
more to that set A, that's this joint of A,

348
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,500
increases the probability of absorbing that event.

349
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,780
So if you add more possibilities,

350
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,580
this becomes more probable.

351
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,580
And in quantum mechanics, this is not quite the case.

352
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,100
It's non-monotonic, but this is something

353
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,020
that I'm not gonna talk too much about.

354
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,060
So how do we get negative probabilities?

355
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,420
We might be tempted to just violate this requirement

356
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,420
and we're done with it.

357
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,300
But the problem is that there are certain constraints

358
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,700
about negative probabilities

359
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,620
that at least seem to make sense,

360
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,980
which is that first and foremost,

361
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,500
we never directly observe a negative probability.

362
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,300
What the heck does it mean to even observe

363
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,540
a negative probability?

364
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,740
So we need to understand how exactly

365
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,100
does the negative probability show

366
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,420
in terms of directly observable quantities.

367
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,100
And observables are not parts of komagorov stock.

368
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,900
So we need to include that.

369
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,460
And furthermore, there's no connection

370
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,220
if we just like relax this requirement

371
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,220
that ties the marginals to the empirical observable contexts.

372
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,700
So what we're gonna do here is just try to show

373
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,340
how we can define negative probabilities

374
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,380
with those ideas in mind.

375
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,860
So that's our major theoretic definition

376
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,300
of negative probabilities.

377
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,380
It's gonna be a little bit abstract from now on,

378
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,020
but I'm gonna try to give the main ideas

379
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,300
of what is the outlining of this definition, right?

380
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,980
We start with a sample space, not a sample space.

381
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,940
We start with the concept of assigned measure.

382
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,580
So assigned measure is exactly the same as a measure,

383
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,700
except that instead of having a measure

384
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,460
going from a sigma algebra to the set

385
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,980
of non-negative real numbers,

386
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,060
assigned measure is something that takes the sets

387
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:03,060
of elements of the algebra into any real number,

388
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,740
including negative numbers.

389
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,020
And this is well known in measure theory.

390
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,740
So it's something that has been studied extensively.

391
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,620
And essentially, if we restrict the assigned measure

392
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,820
to non-negative numbers, we get a regular measure.

393
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,780
And if we restrict this measure

394
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,780
such that mu of omega for this measure is equal to one,

395
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,980
we get probabilities.

396
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,900
So that's the starting point.

397
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,220
We start with assigned measure space

398
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,660
that has the additivity rule as part of it.

399
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,340
And then once we have this assigned measure space,

400
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,180
we need to find a way to connect it

401
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,060
to the actual observations that we have.

402
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,900
And the starting point is to create an object

403
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,260
that's not quite a random variable,

404
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,620
but it's what we call an extended random variable

405
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,260
because instead of being defined over a probability space,

406
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,260
we're defining it into assigned measure space.

407
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,180
And the idea is just that if the assigned measure space

408
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,740
then becomes a probability space,

409
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,420
those random variables become regular random variables.

410
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,780
And the definition is just the standard definition

411
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,300
of random variable where you have a function

412
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,180
that goes from your sample space

413
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,180
to some real number M that's parts of a sets.

414
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,140
This should be this M here, something wrong here.

415
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,900
Anyway, and such that this function

416
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,100
is a measurable function in the sense

417
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,780
of this measure that we have.

418
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,900
It's a measure induced definition.

419
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,220
And then from this, we can kind of like start

420
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,020
to narrow down the idea of contexts.

421
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,620
And contexts are just proper subsets

422
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,300
of those random variables,

423
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,220
such that there is a sub sigma algebra

424
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,500
for each one of those subsets of the random variables.

425
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,220
That define a probability space

426
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,540
for those random variables there.

427
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,780
So intuitively we'll have this bunch

428
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,300
of extended random variables.

429
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,940
And we have this measure space

430
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,140
describing those extended random variables.

431
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,740
But then we get a subspace of that.

432
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,140
And this subspace has a measure space associated to it

433
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,380
such that we actually have proper random variables

434
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,620
in this subspace.

435
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,980
And this allows us to talk now

436
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,740
about families of signed probabilistic models

437
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,380
that have just those contexts defined for those families

438
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,740
and then measures in this context.

439
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,820
I'm gonna skip a little bit faster in this.

440
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,780
And then once we do that,

441
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,700
we can find a concept of a general context

442
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,460
that just has like the same idea of the broader one.

443
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,820
But now we're saying that those are just for those guys

444
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,620
that look like probabilities in the subspace.

445
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,500
So finally, we have like those families

446
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,460
of signed probability models.

447
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,500
And those families of signed probability models,

448
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,740
what you have are those like functions

449
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,900
that reproduce all the expectations

450
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,640
that you have on the contexts.

451
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,500
But it's kind of like the wild west here

452
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,860
because they can be as large or as small as you want.

453
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,700
And what we need to do then is tame a little bit

454
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,900
those set of functions by saying,

455
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,900
look, if we now take the sum of all the probabilities,

456
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,180
the extended probabilities that we have

457
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,180
over the sample space for each one of those elements

458
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,020
of this signed probability spaces, we get a value.

459
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,660
And what we want are the smallest possible values possible

460
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,980
because when that happens,

461
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,620
we're as close as we can be

462
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,860
to a proper probability distribution.

463
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,220
In fact, this is gonna come up in a theorem later on.

464
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,300
And when we do that,

465
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,660
when we ask for the minimum value of the sum,

466
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,340
then we call that a negative probability space.

467
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,380
It's when this minimum is obtained.

468
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,160
If we do that, then we have the following theorem.

469
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,020
Imagine that you have now this guy

470
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,620
as a minimum signed probability space

471
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,660
or as a negative probability space.

472
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,660
So if this M defined as the sum of the probabilities

473
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,220
of elements of the sample space is equal to one,

474
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,860
then this is a probability space.

475
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,620
It's very intuitive to see why that is.

476
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,340
It's because if you remove the absolute value of this,

477
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,440
this is just the probability of omega,

478
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,820
which is always one for a probability space.

479
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,780
And what you're saying is that nothing is pulling

480
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,940
that probability higher or lower

481
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,540
because the sum of the absolute values

482
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,820
is the same as the sum without absolute values.

483
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,080
There's nothing negative here.

484
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,620
It's all non-negative.

485
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,380
So this is also a probability space.

486
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,340
And alternatively, if this guy,

487
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,020
it's missing the both face omega here,

488
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,740
but if this is a probability space,

489
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,740
then it's also a signed probability space of M equals one.

490
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,500
Additionally, a collection of extended random variables

491
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,340
of this space is contextual,

492
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,420
if and only if M is not one.

493
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,900
So we have here criteria for contextuality

494
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,820
just showing up in the definition of negative probabilities.

495
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,020
I'm gonna skip this because I'm running out of time,

496
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,700
but this is how you can connect it to a quantum mechanics.

497
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,300
I gotta say there are lots of different ways

498
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,700
in which negative probabilities connect to a quantum mechanics.

499
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,020
For example, the previous speaker mentioned about PR boxes.

500
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,940
You can, as long as you have no signaling,

501
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,180
you can describe any correlations

502
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,660
in terms of negative probabilities.

503
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,260
So you can describe PR boxes in terms of negative probabilities.

504
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,020
You can describe GHC in terms of negative probabilities

505
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,440
or Bell in terms of negative probabilities.

506
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,440
But a natural question that often comes up

507
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,640
comes up in this discussion of negative probabilities

508
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,720
is what are the interpretations

509
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,800
that we can give to a negative probabilities?

510
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,640
I'm gonna talk about three possible interpretations.

511
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,960
Andrei Krenikov, he uses

512
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,800
a piatic matrix to give an interpretation

513
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,480
of negative probabilities as a violation

514
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,800
of von Mises principle of stability.

515
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,920
So as we know,

516
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,840
if you wanna have a frequentist interpretation

517
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,400
of probabilities, what are probabilities?

518
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,000
And von Mises defines probabilities

519
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
as being over infinite sequences

520
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,520
of possible outcomes on the sample space,

521
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,640
of possible values in the sample space.

522
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,640
And those probabilities are only defined

523
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,560
for those infinite sequences

524
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,640
if they converge to a number.

525
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,240
So that's what Mises principle of stability.

526
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,240
So what Krenikov noticed is that for certain sequences

527
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,640
that violate the principle of stability,

528
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,360
you can actually define probabilities for them

529
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,000
if you use a piatic metric.

530
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And when you do that, the sequences that violate

531
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,040
von Mises principle of stability

532
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,600
actually take negative values.

533
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,680
So that's the interpretation that he gives,

534
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,800
is that negative probabilities are associated with numbers

535
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,640
that violate the principle of stability,

536
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,360
which in terms of like, if you are trying to understand,

537
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,200
for example, Bell correlations,

538
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
it means that those sequences

539
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,800
that you're assuming to be independent,

540
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,480
they're not actually independent.

541
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,800
Because...

542
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,440
You have 10 minutes including the question.

543
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,920
Oh yeah, I'm just finishing it.

544
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,400
Just finishing the rotations.

545
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,240
Thanks.

546
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,680
So another interpretation is proposed

547
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,720
by Bromsky and Brandenburger.

548
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,000
It's actually based on the composition theorem

549
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,640
that shows that if you have a signed measure,

550
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,880
you can always break it down into two measures,

551
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,440
one positive and one negative,

552
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,920
and each one of them independently are non-signed measures.

553
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,600
And what they do is they just attach a sign

554
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,680
to each one of the outcomes of an experiment,

555
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,960
and then those signs,

556
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,680
they lead to cancellation of certain events.

557
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,920
There's a third interpretation,

558
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,520
which is the one put forth by Derrack

559
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,760
and later on by Feynman,

560
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,280
which is that probabilities,

561
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,600
negative probabilities for that matter,

562
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,000
are just a bookkeeping device.

563
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,760
So in that sense,

564
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,920
negative probabilities are nothing more

565
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,400
than the same as we do with negative numbers.

566
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,440
So for example,

567
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,440
we never observe a negative number of apples.

568
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,320
In fact, it's nonsensical to talk about

569
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,640
a negative number of numbers as an actual observable,

570
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,880
but it doesn't mean that using negative numbers of apples

571
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,760
is not a useful book counting device.

572
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,160
We never observe a negative number of dollars

573
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,480
for that matter either.

574
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,880
It doesn't mean that one never has negative numbers

575
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,640
in an account as a bookkeeping device

576
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,760
for how much money we have in an account.

577
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,880
And the reason why I'm mentioning numbers here

578
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,680
is because the concept of even using negative numbers

579
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,400
has not been always non-controversial.

580
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,800
Consider, for example,

581
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,360
the following quote by De Morgan,

582
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,160
the famous mathematician and logician

583
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,920
in a book that he wrote in the 30s.

584
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,860
And I'll read the quote to you.

585
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,220
Above all, he, the student,

586
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,900
must reject the definition still sometimes given

587
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,580
of the quantity minus A, that it is less than nothing.

588
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,420
It is astonishing that the human intellect

589
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,940
should ever have tolerated such an absurdity

590
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,620
as the idea of a quantity less than nothing.

591
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,620
Above all, that the notion should have outlived the beliefs

592
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,580
in judicial astrology and the nonexistence of witches,

593
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,180
either of which is 10,000 times more possible.

594
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,900
So as late as like the 1800s,

595
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,820
negative numbers were still considered

596
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,300
like an absurd idea by some.

597
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,140
And it might be the case that negative probabilities

598
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,540
will in the future be considered the same

599
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,380
as we consider negative numbers,

600
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,500
something just natural, like natural numbers are

601
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,780
as a bookkeeping device.

602
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,380
So just to summarize what I talked today,

603
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,620
as we discussed, contextuality is a key characteristic

604
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,860
of quantum properties.

605
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,220
We often use hybrid space formalism to describe

606
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,460
those quantum properties and the hybrid space formalism

607
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,700
has built in that contextuality.

608
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:25,420
That contextuality cannot be represented

609
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,900
in probability theory unless you do something

610
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,140
like for example, the approach of contextuality by default

611
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,060
by increasing the number of random variables.

612
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,620
But that goes against a little bit the idea

613
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,620
that we do in physics because we have the same measurement

614
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,180
apparatus for some of those things.

615
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,620
But extended probability theories can be constructed.

616
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,740
And here we just presented a measure theoretic framework

617
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,980
for defining an extended probability

618
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,980
that we feel captures at least the gist

619
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,980
of quantum contextuality in the sense that we can model

620
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,780
quantum contextuality with that probability theory.

621
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,620
And we hope that such tool may be used

622
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,980
when describing quantum phenomena.

623
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,700
Like for example, we know that it implies

624
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,420
the no signaling condition, which is part of quantum systems.

625
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,820
But it's still unclear whether it's useful or not.

626
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:29,820
So I just wanna end with acknowledging my collaborators.

627
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,340
What I talked today is in essence part of a paper

628
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,580
that I did with Federico Halleck

629
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,060
who's organizing this conference.

630
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,180
But I also benefited from a lot of discussions

631
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,380
of many people in particular, those people listed here.

632
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,700
So thank you.

633
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,300
Okay, thank you, Jose, for your talk.

634
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,660
There are some questions in the chat.

635
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,900
The first one is from Shansen.

636
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,820
All right, thank you for that talk.

637
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,460
My question is about, has to do with sort of rhetoric

638
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,460
and pedagogy.

639
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,940
So, you know, like we, it sounds like we think very much

640
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,500
the same way about quantum mechanics is basically

641
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:23,060
like a new framework for handling probabilities.

642
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,900
And I wonder whether it's the smartest strategy

643
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,100
to convince people of our view

644
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,740
that you now like have to like get used to the idea

645
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,860
of negative probabilities.

646
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,260
I mean, if you start, I mean,

647
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,620
you're very nicely laid out the difference.

648
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,380
Like, you know, you have contextuality, right?

649
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,780
You don't, but quantum mechanics doesn't allow you

650
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,340
to have joint probabilities, right?

651
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,980
You can't assign values to all the different variables.

652
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,100
I wonder if there isn't like sort of a more natural way

653
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,980
of like ramming that down people's throats

654
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,020
than going this route of introducing

655
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,300
negative probabilities.

656
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,900
Yeah, thank you.

657
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,700
I confess that I would probably never teach

658
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,980
negative probabilities to my students.

659
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,860
Well, never, I mean, maybe in the future.

660
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,220
That's not the reason why I'm talking

661
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,860
about negative probabilities actually.

662
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,140
The reason why I'm talking about negative probabilities

663
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:23,140
is because I hope that by trying to understand

664
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,500
certain phenomena in terms of negative probabilities,

665
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,820
we might be able to get different insights

666
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,260
into those phenomena that we would not get

667
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,860
from the Hebert space formalism.

668
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,500
I can give you a specific example, right?

669
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,500
So when we look at different principles

670
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,220
that define quantum mechanics that people have tried,

671
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:54,060
like for example, Cabello have tried to define some principles

672
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,940
that give us quantum mechanics.

673
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,860
When you write them down in terms of negative probabilities,

674
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,980
they become clear.

675
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,700
Whether that's a useful tool for us to understand

676
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,140
what's going on with quantum mechanics or not,

677
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,540
I don't know because I didn't get any special insights

678
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,060
from that, but that's my hope, right?

679
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,740
That's what I'm trying to do.

680
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,540
I'm trying to see if we can understand

681
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,940
different types of quantum puzzles

682
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,420
in terms of negative probabilities

683
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,020
such that we can get better insight from them.

684
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,220
If we do, then perhaps in the future,

685
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,700
we might even try to teach our students that,

686
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,340
but we're not there yet.

687
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,540
Okay, thank you.

688
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:40,660
And there is another question from Alison Decini.

689
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,580
Hi, can you hear me?

690
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,260
Yes, I can hear you.

691
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,700
Okay, so thanks for the very nice question.

692
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,340
My question is about Cauchy-Speccher theorem.

693
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,780
So how do you avoid Cauchy-Speccher theorem

694
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,300
in this kind of framework?

695
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,940
Because Cauchy-Speccher theorem

696
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,860
rule out the existence of evaluations.

697
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,220
And if we represent all measurements

698
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,220
as random variables in the same,

699
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,020
sharing the same sample space,

700
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,540
a point of the sample space would be evaluation.

701
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,580
So how can you avoid Cauchy-Speccher theorem

702
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,820
within this approach?

703
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,060
That's my question.

704
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,420
If I understand your question correctly,

705
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,620
you're asking how I avoid Cauchy-Speccher and we don't.

706
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:36,620
Let me go back to the GHZ case,

707
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,940
which is a, so the difference

708
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,460
between GHZ and Cauchy-Speccher

709
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,780
that GHZ is for a specific state

710
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,420
and Cauchy-Speccher is for any state, right?

711
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,420
It's about the algebra of quantum observables.

712
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,620
But you could think of Cauchy-Speccher

713
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,620
as a series of measurements that prepare a state

714
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,420
and then later on you get a contradiction.

715
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,780
That's a different way to think about Cauchy-Speccher,

716
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,900
but it's all there together.

717
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,900
But this is the GHZ also has a contradiction, right?

718
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,940
And the contradiction comes here

719
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,660
from this guy in the bottom.

720
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,580
This first parenthesis being one times one times one

721
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,340
being equal to minus one.

722
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,460
It's the same type of contradiction

723
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,980
that you get on Cauchy-Speccher.

724
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,380
And you are using random variables

725
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,940
because each one of them individually are random.

726
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,260
But if you look at each one of those products,

727
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,220
if you thought of them as an individual random variable,

728
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,420
let's say we call this product A,

729
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,980
we call this product B and we call this product C.

730
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,300
What we have is that A times B times C is equal to D.

731
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,860
But this is what quantum mechanics tells us,

732
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,140
but A is equal to one, B is equal to one

733
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,900
and C is equal to one whereas D is equal to minus one.

734
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,300
That's the contradiction.

735
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,620
And the random variables that we have here

736
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,680
are deterministic random variables.

737
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,580
So I don't know if I'm answering your question

738
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,460
the way you thought about it,

739
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,260
but what I'm saying is we're not avoiding it.

740
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,780
We have the contradictions there,

741
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,820
but the contradictions come

742
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,580
from the assumptions of Cauchy-Speccher.

743
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,460
And the assumption of Cauchy-Speccher

744
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,980
is that this guy here, say Y2 in this context

745
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,780
is the same as the Y2 in this context.

746
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,220
And when we use negative probabilities,

747
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,140
that assumption is not true anymore

748
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,780
because negative probabilities

749
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,480
are washing out those requirements

750
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,080
of how is it that those random variables are related.

751
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,740
And then what you're asking about,

752
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,060
if you were to ask me how exactly

753
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,500
they are washing out those requirements,

754
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,860
I would tell, wow, I don't know.

755
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,220
That's how we book keep those probabilities.

756
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,100
If you wanna know how they are doing that,

757
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,260
then you would need to go to an interpretation

758
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,220
that is not a purely epistemic interpretation

759
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,300
as in bookkeeping.

760
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,700
And there's nothing that forbids you from doing that, right?

761
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,900
Does that make sense, what I'm saying?

762
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,140
Or am I being confused here, confusing?

763
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,900
Yeah, yeah, no, it makes sense.

764
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,220
Thanks, thank you.

765
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,780
Okay, we are done of the break.

766
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,120
So, but there is one more question.

767
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,260
It is very fast.

768
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,900
So perhaps I can make it, if it's okay with you.

769
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,100
So it is just about the notion of contextuality

770
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,940
that you seem to be using.

771
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,900
I'm just curious if you are familiar

772
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,540
with the work of Speckens and this idea

773
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,340
of using a different definition of contextuality

774
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,140
than the one that seems to be used in Gohan Specker

775
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,420
and in Bell's proof of non-contextuality.

776
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,980
And if that makes a difference in the kind of project

777
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,980
that you are using to accommodate all of contextuality

778
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,940
using negative probabilities.

779
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,060
Yeah, that's a good question.

780
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,580
One could give a whole talk about like different ways

781
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,860
of thinking about contextuality, right?

782
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,900
So I've been very casual about talking

783
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,820
about contextuality here and very specific about it.

784
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:44,700
But it's unclear exactly how those different notions

785
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,660
of contextuality relate to each other.

786
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,780
Sometimes, not all the time, right?

787
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:55,780
And to be very precise, one would need to prove

788
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,380
what is the relationship between one definition

789
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,900
of contextuality and another definition of contextuality.

790
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,300
And as far as I know, that has not been done

791
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,620
for all notions of contextuality.

792
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:14,420
But there is this intuition that they kind of like

793
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,580
are talking about the same thing.

794
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,260
Because at the end of the day,

795
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,060
they're all about commasurable properties

796
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,300
and how those commasurable properties

797
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,060
somehow are related to not having a possibility

798
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,420
of talking about all of those properties at the same time,

799
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,020
in terms of the intuition behind them.

800
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,100
I know I'm not answering your question

801
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,220
and the reason why I'm not answering your question

802
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,940
is because I'm trying to say that I don't think

803
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:48,100
there is a very clear answer to that question yet.

804
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,020
But we hope that once we give a definition

805
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,460
that's a measure theoretic definition,

806
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,220
that precise definition of negative probabilities

807
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:01,020
that correspond to also a definition of contextuality

808
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:05,220
in that setup, that you can use that to prove theorems

809
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,860
about how those things are related.

810
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,300
It might be really, really interesting to explore that

811
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,660
for two reasons, because the kind of definition

812
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,580
that the Speckens uses makes no explicit reference

813
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,700
to the idea of measuring two things at the same time.

814
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,820
It is kind of different to the general idea.

815
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,620
And two, because in the original paper,

816
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,780
I think that that's from 25,

817
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,900
he has a small derivation of showing that

818
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,500
from his definition, you can derive the traditional one,

819
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,820
the one that the Cohen Speckens used.

820
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,380
So there must be a connection.

821
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

822
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,260
All those things are related,

823
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:55,500
but how exactly they are related, it's not.

824
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,860
Intuitively, yes, they should be related,

825
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,300
but it's one thing to think that they should be related

826
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,740
intuitively and to prove that they're related.

827
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,820
So that's what I was trying to say.

828
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:13,100
Thank you, Jose, and the people who have questions

829
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,740
would have some minutes to go to the bathroom

830
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,220
or take a coffee.

831
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,060
We will back.
