0	7000	I will speak today about a measure theoretic approach to negative probabilities.
7000	12000	It will be a complimentary talk to that of Acasio earlier today.
12000	28000	I'll first start setting the mathematical background and the intuitions or concepts that are behind these mathematics and then I will jump into some technicalities of the negative probability approach based on measure theory.
29000	38000	So suppose that you have a probabilistic system, it could be an atom to fix ideas, but it could be any other thing that you're observing.
38000	45000	And then you perform measurements. So this drawing here represents a particular type of measurement.
45000	62000	Each measurement will have or experiment at one performance will have outcomes. I wrote only three of them here but this is quite general it will be any number of different outcomes. So these are the outcomes of a particular experiment.
62000	76000	But when one considers the set of outcomes, one conforms an outcome set and from an outcome set one gets a Boolean algebra of events associated to that outcome set.
76000	91000	And a probability will be nothing but a measure satisfying Kolmogorov's options, as was explained in Jorge Hirsch's talk the other day.
91000	106000	So I will not go into the details because this was discussed several times in this conference, fortunately, but if you don't get any of this, you can, of the maths of this, you can think about it as a dice or a coin.
106000	118000	So each empirical context, so each, each concrete experiment that you perform on a system on a probabilistic system will define a set of probabilities.
118000	137000	And mathematically, we describe this using the notion of a measurable space, which consists of an outcome set, a Boolean algebra, and a measure that behaves pretty much like in measure theory as if it were an area as in Lebesgue.
137000	144000	So Sigma is a sigma algebra but what is important for us is that it is a Boolean algebra.
144000	149000	So the distributive laws hold.
149000	167000	A random variable is nothing but a measurable function. If you don't have the mathematical details of a measurable function at hand, think simply about an observable in classical physics like the energy or the, or any other quantity.
167000	181000	So what it is important is that with this mathematical formalism, one has a well defined probability theory that allows to compute mean values and probabilities of any event in a rigorous way.
181000	190000	So this is called Mogorov theory. So each experiment keeps place to a call Mogorovian probability theory.
190000	203000	I can perform other experiments. I represented this symbolically using another drawing. And there are many different types of experiments that we can perform on a probabilistic system.
203000	207000	Some of them can be performed together.
207000	219000	We can perform this one and this one, but some of them cannot. So, as it happens in quantum theory, we cannot measure a spin of the system in two different directions at the same time.
219000	229000	So some experiments are jointly measurable and other experiments are not.
229000	243000	So what one ends up in a, in a sort of matrix like this, this means that on each row of the matrix, we have experiments that can be performed together.
243000	255000	So this one, these two can be performed together, these two can be performed together and so on. But if one mixes elements from different columns, they cannot be performed together.
255000	264000	So this is a general situation in any empirical probabilistic theory. Quantum mechanics is just a concrete example of this.
264000	275000	So what is important for us is that for, for each pair or shortly measurable experiments that exists a classical probability model.
275000	289000	You can define a Kolmogorovian probability that allows me to describe the combined experiment, but you don't have a global classical probability in order to describe all possible experiments.
289000	302000	If you try to do that, you very quickly reach into contradictions or things that might not happen in the world, like for example as happens in the very inequalities.
302000	312000	So I put this here with mathematics right this was with drawings, but now I put the same with mathematics you have random variables on each row.
312000	315000	And notice that some experiments.
315000	320000	For example, this one here, the arrow can be performed with this one.
320000	328000	But there, but the same experiment, the same empirical procedure appears in two different contexts.
328000	339000	That is one of the most important characteristics in quantum mechanics. There are experimental procedures that are the same, but in different contexts.
339000	346000	So, one can say that contexts or measurement contexts defined by rows.
346000	350000	So just the ones I am showing you here.
350000	356000	Context are intertwined. Why because they share things.
356000	368000	So, each experiment is described by a Kolmogorovian probability space, but also each row of the matrix.
368000	386000	By that I mean a collection of compatible random variables that can whose experiments can be performed together will have also associated a measurable space for all the random variables that might be not that there might not exist.
386000	403000	This is the global classical probability distribution, but notice that these random variables F11 and F14 are essentially the same, because they have the same content and are defined by the same empirical procedure.
403000	419000	They might not be a priority identified because they belong to different contexts, and this is very important in statistics because it might lead to two problems if one don't have, if you don't have that into account.
419000	425000	So, one has some observables that belong to different contexts.
425000	437000	What is the status of the observables that have the same content, but belong to different contexts. Well, in principle, one could try to identify them to put an equal sign between them.
437000	446000	This is very usual in physics. Why, because the marginals, even if they belong to different contexts, the marginal are the same.
446000	453000	Given that they are the same, you can identify them and not having too much trouble.
453000	462000	Notice that this is the no signal condition. The marginal probability for this will not depend on the context.
462000	476000	But some authors say that they are different, because this is a natural assumption in statistics, because in general, in a general probabilistic theory, this might be signal.
476000	483000	So the marginals, the probabilities associated to this particular experiment could be different.
483000	487000	Unfortunately, it doesn't happen in quantum theory.
487000	494000	With Acasio de Barros and Decio Krause, we propose to consider them as indistinguishable.
494000	500000	And we combine this notion with the mathematical formalism of quasi set theory.
500000	508000	But usually an identification takes place. So one, one, so one can see that contexts are intertwined.
508000	519000	C1 cannot be performed at the same time with C2. If one chooses to perform experiment C1, one cannot perform experiment C2.
519000	528000	So a state, a quantum state will give us a collection of classical probabilities, one for each context.
528000	537000	But we know that contexts are intertwined. So we have quantum observables, maximally compatible quantum observables define context.
538000	547000	So one has an injection here, a kind of embedding of Boolean algebras. This is a Boolean algebras, and this guy here is a Boolean algebras too.
547000	556000	And for Boolean algebras, we have classical probabilities. For each observable, a classical probability, and for each context, a classical probability.
557000	562000	But the thing is that given that contexts are intertwined, this is not the end of the story.
562000	569000	So we know that there is a mathematical object that contains the information about all possible contexts.
569000	583000	This is the lattice of projection operators of the Hilbert space. So a quantum state is not a classical probability, but it is a measure on the non Boolean lattice of projection operators acting on the Hilbert space.
584000	591000	And the glissons theorem makes this diagram commutative.
591000	593000	Why?
593000	602000	In quantum mechanics, as I said, we have a global object that contains the information about all the contexts and correlations.
602000	611000	It is very useful in practice. If we will only stay in the classical description, it will be very difficult to deal with quantum phenomena.
611000	625000	The great step forward of quantum physics is to build a non commutative probability calculus that allows us to give a unified description for all possible measurement contexts.
625000	639000	The story will not end up there because we know that there is more, the projections are elements of a ring of operators, and due to glissons theorem, all these diagram commutes.
639000	655000	So there are at least two ways of describing global states, an object like this, this guy here is a measure, and this guy here is a density operator, but remember that they are the same because of glissons theorem.
655000	667000	The first alternative is the one just described, to paste Boolean algebras and end up in a non Boolean structure and define states as usual in quantum mechanics or in quantum logics.
667000	688000	One can speak about automodular lattices or partial Boolean algebras, but the second alternative, and it is very important in physics, I will explain why in a minute, is to keep using Boolean algebras and create here a Boolean algebra, but allowing this measure to be negative.
688000	693000	This is a move that is very important in quantum physics.
693000	705000	Why negative probabilities are so important in physics. Well, they have a long tradition in the history of physics. Everyone knows the beginner quasi probability distribution and its applications.
705000	728000	And Iraq also studied them in the context of energy, for example, he says negative energies and probabilities should not be considered as nonsense they are well defined concepts mathematically like a negative money, and also Feynman tried to dig into the mysteries of negative probability he says trying to think of negative probabilities gave me a cool cultural shock at first.
728000	735000	And when I finally go easy with the concept, I wrote myself a note so I wouldn't forget so.
735000	755000	So it the lesson says, well, there's a video of Peter shore explaining that he attended to a lecture by Feynman, and he was thinking that allowing negative probabilities would allow to understand the EPR paradox, and of course he was right to a great extent.
755000	767000	So, but the most important thing for us is that many relevant applications in quantum optics, quantum contextuality and quantum information theory, rely on dealing with negative probability.
767000	782000	So, even if you like it or not, if you're a practicing physicist is very likely that you find yourself working on negative probabilities or trying to read a paper that deals with negative probabilities because they are a very useful practical tool.
782000	794000	So, now I will turn into a joint work with Professor Acasio de Barrios from the San Francisco State University about negative probabilities.
794000	805000	Let me explain the motivations first. We started to work on contextuality and we were wondering what will be a general definition of negative probability.
805000	818000	Of course, there are many in the literature, but we wonder whether it was possible to give a definition which is based solely on measure theory, as in Kolmogorov's actions.
818000	832000	So we wanted the, the negative probability version of Kolmogorov theory, is that possible. And importantly, we wanted it to be independent of any Hilbert space structure.
832000	844000	So we don't want to rely in the quantum formalism. Another question was how to incorporate the notion of context from the very beginning. This is very important, the notion of contextuality.
844000	851000	And the other question was to study connections between indistinguishability and negative probabilities.
851000	858000	So, the details can be found here in this publication is from the last year.
858000	864000	But now I'll give some some idea of the definition and its technical properties.
864000	878000	The simple move will be instead of using Kolmogorov's actions to use just a sign measure, which is the same as Kolmogorov, but one allows this measure to take negative values.
878000	890000	Now we don't put the evaluation into the zero one interval, but we allow all possible real numbers. This is, so this triplet here will be called a sign measure space.
890000	896000	But of course, there's a problem here because in quantum mechanics, we need contexts.
896000	910000	Where are contexts in this definition, they are not included. So, we need to find, we needed to find a definition that incorporates from the very beginning, the possibility of having measurement contexts.
910000	929000	So one, one way that we found was starting with a sign measure space, define the notion of an extended random variable, which is the same, pretty the same as a random variable, but now define over the sign space.
929000	945000	So now the pre image of every open interval or everybody said will be just a measurable set associated to the space but the measure could be negative up to now.
945000	963000	This is very usual, but now it comes to the idea that I think that changes the setting because what we do is to consider a family, a collection of extended random variables defined on a family of signed probability models.
963000	972000	What we say is that the general context will be a subset of this family. So a context will be a collection of random variables.
972000	995000	Such that there exists a sub sigma algebra of the algebra associated to this family of of of sign probability models in such a way that when the probabilities are restricted to the sub sigma algebra, they are classical.
995000	1015000	So, for all F for all event in this sub sigma algebra this try and becomes a classical probability space and the random variables of that context are classical random variables with regard to that measurement context.
1015000	1030000	So, let me put now an example suppose that we have three random variables, and the three of them are not compatible so you cannot perform an experiment in which the three of them are measured together.
1030000	1054000	So, you can measure X and Y, Y and Z and X and Z, but not the three of them at the same time. So what you have is for each pair for example X and Y, you will have a classical probability space for Y and Z a classical probability space depicted here in red and for X and Z.
1054000	1063000	Another classical probability space depicted in green, but the whole thing is embedded in a Boolean algebra.
1063000	1083000	Sigma. So this Sigma one is a is a sub algebra of Sigma Sigma two and Sigma three they are sub algebras and Omega is the same. And this is done in such a way that when move the global measure when restricted to the black circle here is a classical probability
1083000	1093000	and coincides with P1 and the same move restricted to the red circle coincides with P3 and so on.
1093000	1103000	But move is not necessarily positive, it might take negative values. So this allows us to describe
1103000	1113000	probabilities and surprisingly it includes many physical examples of interest like the beginner transform can be described in this way.
1113000	1126000	But this way is not dependent on the Hilbert space formalism, of course, and also the value inequalities and many other examples. So with this definition, we think that we capture the notion of
1126000	1140000	the contextuality of having contexts that are not necessarily compatible between them, but with the global noel shape that might take a negative values.
1141000	1153000	Assigned probability space, also called the negative probability will be assigned measure space and do it with a non empty set of context in the sense of the previous definition.
1153000	1158000	The measure will be assigned probability or a negative probability.
1158000	1168000	This is for example, what happens, I showed you here for example, X and Y, how to build a Boolean algebra for the two of them.
1168000	1179000	So this is how the Boolean algebra looks like, and the probability assigned to them will be a measure defined here, as in measure theory.
1179000	1195000	And of course one can go on and add more variables X Y set and create a Boolean algebra. So our algorithm, what it does is to compute first a global Boolean algebra for all the random variables, even if they are not compatible.
1195000	1203000	But then, in that global Boolean algebra, we define a measure which might take negative values.
1203000	1217000	So how would that work for the three random variables? Well, one ends up in a family of equations, these are linear equations. The inputs are the mean values of the random variables.
1217000	1230000	One has for example, the mean values of single random variables, and here one must solve these equations for the piece, the piece are the probabilities associated to the elementary events.
1230000	1236000	One also can consider mean values of products of random variables and so on.
1236000	1245000	Depending on how much information one inputs into this system, one might have one solution, many or none, it depends.
1245000	1259000	But the thing is that one ends up in a linear system and using the input one can solve this linear system and find all possible negative probabilities that are compatible with the input statistics.
1259000	1274000	So this is how our general definition describes families of non-compatible random variables. But there's something important. In this definition,
1274000	1291000	we are using measure theory. So there is no restriction to finite models. I am explaining things using a finite model, but with the atomic random variables, but this is not restricted to finite sets.
1291000	1300000	So it is pretty much a single model of theory. So you have a very nice measure theory going on.
1300000	1311000	So I'm just about to end. So what are the advantages? Well, the advantages of this approach, it can be used to define contextuality measures.
1311000	1322000	So this is done by quantifying how negative is your state. And it includes previous examples of non-signal models as particular cases.
1322000	1330000	So the probabilities never appear in experiments. Only concrete contexts represent what actually happens.
1330000	1335000	And it is possible also to define an entropic measure in the usual way.
1335000	1346000	So this is the usual way in quantum logic. You just take sort of convex roots on all possible measurement contexts.
1346000	1362000	And how will that be in the in the very inequalities? Well, Jorge Hirsch was talking about this the other day, not so explicit about negative probabilities, but he described how to build a hidden variable model for a bell type scenario.
1362000	1371000	So if one proceeds that way, one ends in a Boolean algebra, as in bell, and a classical probability. Well, of course, bell stops because he cannot go on.
1371000	1381000	He says, well, it doesn't exist. It leads to a contradiction. Of course, of course, because quantum mechanics cannot be described by the global classical probability measure.
1381000	1393000	But if you allow for negative probabilities, and this was a clear intuition of Feynman, so you can find a solution. You will get a lot of equations. These are linear equations.
1393000	1412000	They look bad, but this is very simple. And you find that actually a singlet state will be described by the negative probability. So we have a general universal framework for dealing with negative probabilities that includes, as far as we know,
1412000	1423000	the most example examples of interest, and it is based on measure theory, a single model of theory, but it is an extension that allows to describe contextual theories.
1423000	1433000	So, it seems to us that to understand contextuality is deeply related to understand how contexts are intertwined.
1433000	1444000	And how global states and even algebra emerge. The identification of random variables among different contexts seem to play a key role in their genesis.
1444000	1451000	There seems to be an indistinguishably indistinguishability principle at play. Why?
1451000	1473000	Let me come back to this slide here. In order to build a global boonial algebra, I have to assume that this random variable x is the same when I consider it in context y, x, y, and it's the same when I consider it in context x set, and so on for y and set.
1473000	1485000	That is very important. So I have to identify random variables that have the same content but belong to different and incompatible contexts.
1485000	1497000	So we have discussed the general features of a measure theoretical approach for describing quantum states, and our approach makes boonial algebras and allows for negative probabilities.
1497000	1511000	If you are interested in this approach, you can go to some of our previous papers, especially this one last year, and I thank you for your attention. That's all.
1511000	1516000	Okay, thank you for your talk.
1516000	1531000	If there are questions, you can express it in the chat and give you the word. It is a question from Allison testing.
1531000	1533000	Hi.
1533000	1536000	So, can you hear me?
1536000	1538000	Yes.
1538000	1562000	Okay, so thanks for the talk. And when you discussed quantum predictions from this perspective, do you take into account the spectrum of operators, or do you assume that outcomes, the value doesn't matter?
1562000	1571000	Let me see if I understand your question. I'm just, when I speak about projection operators, I just speak about the usual thing that you do in quantum mechanics.
1571000	1578000	Quantum mechanics observables are represented by self-adjoint operators.
1578000	1581000	In the finite dimensional case, they are Hermitian.
1581000	1590000	And of course, a particular subfamily of the Hermitian operators or self-adjoint in the infinite dimensional case are the projection operators.
1590000	1601000	So it turns out that these mathematical entities have a very precise structure which is that they form a lattice.
1601000	1609000	So with projection operators, you mean the physical interpretation of what you mean?
1609000	1612000	No.
1612000	1618000	If I understood it correctly, you represent measurements as random variables, correct?
1618000	1627000	Ah, yeah, I understand. Now I see your question. Now I see. Now I see. But let me explain you something that might make it very clear.
1627000	1636000	Look, let us start the other way around, because I went from the basics to the most complicated. But suppose that you assume quantum mechanics, standard quantum mechanics.
1636000	1639000	Okay, then you have a ring of operators. That's trivial, right?
1639000	1651000	Okay, so now you have a density operator that gives probabilities for all observables here, right?
1651000	1659000	So it turns out that if you restrict to elementary tests, like yes, no questions.
1659000	1669000	Like for example, is the photon inside this box or not? So you represent that by a projection operator.
1669000	1680000	But each context, each context, so each time you have a family, a maximum family of compatible observables,
1680000	1687000	if you look at the projection operators associated to that family, they form a Hullian algebra.
1687000	1694000	Do you agree? Okay. So that's elementary. So then these are the Hullian algebras here in this round.
1694000	1700000	But these Hullian algebras are subalgebras of an algebra which is non-Bullian.
1700000	1708000	So each quantum state, when restricted to one of these Hullian algebras, defines a classical probability model.
1708000	1714000	This is why you can perform experiments, otherwise you wouldn't be able to do nothing in an laboratory.
1714000	1721000	And you do experiment, and you just consider a family of compatible observables, you will have a classical probability.
1721000	1730000	But the whole thing is not classical because there is no joint global probability distribution for all the possible contexts.
1730000	1736000	But notice the move that we do here. This is standard physics.
1736000	1741000	This is what every physicist do. But also physicists do this.
1741000	1752000	So what you can do is not to create the quantum logic. Don't do that. Don't go into the ring of operators, but go into the Wigner transform.
1752000	1760000	For example, when you have the Wigner function, you transform the observable and you have P and Q in the same space.
1760000	1766000	You have a phase space and a negative probability in that space.
1766000	1774000	This is another way of representing quantum mechanics and quantum states, which turns out to be equivalent. That's very interesting.
1774000	1793000	So what we do here is to get independent, we get independence of the Hilbert space formalism, and we give a general measure theoretic definition of probability that allows contexts,
1793000	1797000	allows also the probabilities to take negative values.
1797000	1807000	And when you restrict to the well-known examples, you will get, yes, the usual, the Wigner distribution. That's the idea.
1807000	1811000	Okay, and can I ask you one more question?
1811000	1814000	I don't know. Ask Sebastiano. I don't know if we have time.
1814000	1820000	There are two more questions.
1820000	1821000	I can wait.
1821000	1827000	You can surely send me an email, Alison. No problem. We can keep, yes.
1827000	1829000	Okay.
1829000	1832000	Discussing after that one.
1832000	1834000	Yes, yes.
1834000	1837000	Thank you.
1837000	1841000	Thank you. Thank Federico for the talk.
1841000	1850000	Every time I hear you again, I understand a little bit more of the kind of proposal that you have in mind.
1850000	1866000	Okay, so I was just curious if we can go back to the last part of your talk where you were making reference to Bell's theorem and the problem with how he assumed how the distributions worked.
1866000	1871000	So here's the thing.
1871000	1881000	You attribute the problem to the idea that he is somehow assuming classical probability, right?
1881000	1885000	It's one of the problems. There are many problems, right?
1885000	1891000	One of them is he assumes classical probability. It's not a problem. It's an assumption.
1891000	1899000	Perhaps that's the answer to my question. But my question was this.
1899000	1913000	It seems that what you're denying basically is the idea that you can have the same distribution over the lambdas, irrespectively of how Bob and Alice measure.
1913000	1918000	Is that correct? You are basically denying the assumption of settings independence.
1918000	1925000	Well, no, because if you allow them to be negative, you can have the same.
1925000	1929000	You see what I mean? That's what I'm saying, right?
1929000	1931000	Okay, that's what I'm saying.
1931000	1938000	I'm telling you that one of the key assumptions, and this was, well, this was even, you can look it on YouTube, for example.
1938000	1942000	It's very nice how Peter Shore tells about it.
1942000	1947000	He says that he attended to lecture by Feynman, and Feynman said that.
1947000	1955000	I mean, one of the main problems is that you're assuming a classical probability, and there are many ways of assuming a classical probability.
1955000	1961000	I mean, there are many, sorry, there are many different ways of not having a classical probability.
1961000	1965000	So Bell assumes a classical probability, correct.
1965000	1972000	So one might say, well, what are the assumptions that are wrong?
1972000	1975000	One possibility could be, well, the world is not local.
1975000	1982000	I think some people believe that there are hidden variables and that the world is not local.
1982000	1986000	It's a very good reasoning.
1986000	1993000	It might be, but it might be that using positive probabilities is not the best.
1993000	1996000	I mean, what justifies conmodal obsessions?
1996000	2004000	That's a very deep discussion, not in quantum physics, in the foundations of probability theory, and it was never easy at all.
2004000	2007000	What are the right rules for probability?
2007000	2018000	So it is presented sometimes as a mild assumption, but if you know about this, it is not.
2018000	2023000	I think it is not. I mean, you cannot present it as a mild assumption. That's what I think.
2023000	2033000	So one way to play is to go into negative probabilities. Of course, some other people will say no, not going to negative, just use non-commutative probability theory.
2033000	2036000	That could be also.
2036000	2052000	Okay, perhaps we can talk in another moment, but my suspicion is going to be that in the end what is really happening, but it's really, really, really the cost of the problem is the idea that you are writing the distribution of lambda independently of the settings of A and B.
2053000	2069000	Yes, but well, that's one of the things, right, in, yes, but you can, what I'm telling you is that you can do that, you can actually do that, and allow the probabilities to be negative, and then you will not derive inequalities.
2069000	2082000	No, but the thing is that you don't need to talk about negative probabilities. You can stop with saying that the distribution of lambda depends on what is going to be measured by Alice and Bob, and you can stop the theorem.
2082000	2083000	The theorem doesn't go.
2083000	2092000	Yeah, I know. That's the usual way to deal with the problem, right? That will say, I mean, an orthodox quantum physics will say, well, it's not the classical probability calculus.
2092000	2106000	Stop assigning values to things that are not measured, stop mixing results from different contexts and assigning global probabilities, because this is what we know from the very beginning of quantum mechanics.
2106000	2111000	Which, if you don't say anything else, that is a mystery, right, because it is.
2111000	2115000	Why would you say that discussion.
2115000	2122000	So, some minutes for the last question from Benny Diggs.
2122000	2124000	Thank you, Federico.
2124000	2129000	I found that a very interesting, even exciting talk.
2129000	2130000	Thanks.
2131000	2135000	I'm still shocked by the negative probabilities.
2135000	2147000	So I can understand that you have a mathematical scheme here in which the negative values of the measure occur and that that makes it possible to combine all these different contexts.
2147000	2162000	I would, I myself would object to using the word probability for the negative measures, if you combine these contexts, because probabilities have to have I have to interpret main interpretations.
2162000	2164000	One is relative frequencies.
2164000	2174000	And the other is a measure of belief, the credence you can attach to a certain proposition, and neither of them applies to this negative probability.
2174000	2186000	So it, in my opinion, these negative probabilities do not qualify as probabilities, they are just mathematical quantities that are signed measures.
2186000	2189000	I agree with that.
2189000	2205000	But I feel and that links to the comments you made on one of the previous question, I think there are very good reasons for the common core of axioms, and especially for the for the axiom that the probability should between zero and one.
2205000	2215000	So to cut things short, my question is why do you insist on on calling these negative values probabilities.
2215000	2219000	If for me it's it's obvious they are not probabilities.
2219000	2223000	Okay, good question. Thanks. Thanks, Dennis.
2223000	2232000	Now let me clarify things because there are there are several problems here. One is the interpretation of negative probabilities, which have scored, of course, in is problematic.
2232000	2245000	In this case, it's not so problematic, because we don't claim that you will measure negative probabilities will we will never ever measure a negative probability that's nonsense, you will not.
2245000	2260000	What you will have is context, you have a very clear here in this definition, a very clear mathematical definition in the sense of called more of of mathematical of of measurement context.
2260000	2271000	This is independent of quantum theory that's what I why I like this. So, on each measurement context, you will have classical probability and that's what you observe in the laboratory.
2271000	2284000	But at the same time, it is reasonable to call you can call it instead of negative probability or sign probability or, I don't know, you can call it the way you want.
2284000	2297000	The interesting point is that this is a natural mathematically is a very natural extension of Kolmogorov theory that incorporates the notion of context from the very beginning as a mathematical concept.
2297000	2312000	That is very important for me. And let me tell you why you know that negative probabilities, even if you don't want to use them as a as a nice interpretation that are very useful in quantum optics.
2312000	2320000	I mean, you, you end up dealing either way or the other with negative probabilities in physics, especially in quantum information.
2320000	2328000	And especially if you want to study contextuality, because usually you want to look at the properties of quantum states.
2328000	2340000	And one way of studying contextuality is to look at the beginner distribution and see how negative it is with regard to a family of observables, for example, or for example, classicality.
2340000	2353000	If you want to study if your system reaches the classical limit or not, a very usual tool is to look at the, how, how negative is the, the, the beginner distribution.
2353000	2371000	So we think that with this definition, we can give the other definitions of contextuality that can be useful in practice to understand better for example why quantum computers have a speed up.
2372000	2387000	Now we are working with Elisa Monkietti, she's starting her master thesis and we try to apply these mathematical tools to study problems in quantum information.
2387000	2388000	That's the goal.
2388000	2399000	It's really difficult to, to escape from that because you cannot tell a guy from quantum optics. No, don't use, don't use quasi probabilities, don't use the beginner distribution.
2399000	2412000	No, people will will continue using it, even, I mean, so, so with this work, we are not claiming that you should replace standard quantum probability by negative probability.
2412000	2423000	So, but we think that this approach will give us at the technical level clues to understand better a quantum context.
2423000	2426000	That's what we think.
2426000	2428000	Okay, thank you.
2428000	2430000	Thanks.
2430000	2438000	Thank you for your talk and for the people who participate, making questions and comments.
