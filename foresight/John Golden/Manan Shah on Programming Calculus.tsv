0	3000	Thank you so much for coming, Monon.
3000	9000	I put out a call on math Twitter and that's how we have interacted with each other in the past.
9000	20000	Monon comes up with so many interesting things and math comics and interesting blog posts that I've been following him for quite a time now.
20000	26000	But he was willing to come on and talk about kind of computational approach to derivatives.
26000	29000	So would you be willing to introduce yourselves?
29000	30000	Yeah, my students.
30000	33000	Yeah, yeah. Hello.
33000	35000	My name is Monon Shah.
35000	44000	I, as John mentioned, I mean, how we know each other is through math Twitter and it's been a fun way to meet other mathematicians.
44000	55000	I, outside of, you know, my blog and general piano and random drawings I may do, I do work in the industry as a mathematician.
55000	68000	I had up an analytics team and in the past I've run data science teams and have been in various industries from gaming and gambling to video ad tech to just video technology.
68000	72000	And we're here to talk about derivatives.
72000	81000	Excellent. And so we should be on Twitter, some code that he whipped up and he's going to show that to us now.
81000	86000	Cool. All right, we're on a separate screen for that.
86000	97000	So the bulk of my job, my day job, if you would, often involves writing code and computing things.
97000	108000	So that's kind of outside of that. So we do have to use our mathematics and the calculus that we learn in various ways, but often in a computational way.
108000	114000	So that what you're seeing here is what's called a Python notebook.
114000	131000	So it's in, it's in something called Jupiter, and that's just a good visual aid for you to run Python code, sort of seamlessly in real time, and you can sort of interact with it as much as possible.
131000	146000	And on the various libraries you have, you have installed the interactions can can be more dynamic or more static but you can still sort of play with your variables if you would.
146000	149000	Yeah, and if my students keep on with math.
149000	157000	They'll definitely see this in some of their courses as as it comes. They use Sage notebooks and Google collab to do to.
158000	160000	Yeah.
160000	168000	Or if they're kind of going into computer science, we have mathematics courses specifically to support that discrete structures and things like that.
168000	180000	Yeah, it's pretty much a hiring requirement for anyone at this point. If they're looking to start analyst roles or data science roles in industry that have at least a background in our Python.
180000	181000	Yeah.
181000	183000	Okay, so what is this program there.
183000	201000	All right, so here what I'd set up for us was just a Python notebook that will help us compute derivatives, numerically, and we can take a look at what some of the pitfalls are with numerical computation but the idea here is,
201000	211000	there's sort of like a calculus approach to computing derivatives and, you know, that is the way the course progress is in a in a theoretical way.
211000	229000	But that theory is based on how, how, how we take our, our, our slopes from from say like an algebra class where, you know, you had that line that equation of a line y equals mx plus B, and your M was your slope.
229000	236000	And when, when you had just a line y equals mx plus B, you could always read off that slope as a number.
236000	248000	But here what, what we want to do is when we have functions that are not just simple lines, but maybe they're, they have some curves in them or they have some change in, in, in direction.
248000	265000	We still are interested in, in slope at various points on that curve. And the idea here is, how would we find those, how would we find that slope on that curve, as we traverse over the curve.
265000	273000	So what we have here, you know, these first two lines basically are importing a bunch of libraries that I might need.
273000	294000	And this function here is, is just a way for me to call a function that I would want to write so in this particular case I wrote function of x and it would just give me back x cubed if I wanted to, and to demonstrate kind of how that works is, if I did function of three, we should get 27.
294000	303000	So function of 123. If you can do that in your head that's great, but you'll get something like this.
303000	305000	My mental computation.
305000	311000	And the nice thing about Python is, we can go a little nuts if we wanted to.
311000	316000	And, and kind of get these big numbers, but.
316000	323000	But anyway, that's, that's the point of this function here. Now, our next function is is dydx.
324000	336000	John, feel free to stop me whenever it makes sense. But what we're trying to do is basically compute slopes at different points on a curve of our choosing.
336000	344000	And the way this function works here is, you have this value f, which is whatever function we want to send in.
344000	350000	And that function could be my x cubed function, it could be sine of x, it could be just plain old x.
350000	361000	We want to know how, how much we should increment the function by, and we want to know over what interval we're interested in looking at the function.
361000	365000	Okay, so you're, so this is just working it's not working globally.
365000	368000	Right, we're kind of picking a range we want it to work on.
368000	376000	And for the step size, you're thinking about like, when we write these slope formulas, that's like the difference in extra values.
376000	386000	Yeah, yeah, so the way this will work is, if we just read through the code, we'll start at the left endpoint of the interval.
386000	403000	And we're going to continue to step forward in the interval until we have exceeded the right endpoint of the interval right so what this is saying is, as a simple example if my interval were 01 s begins at zero.
403000	426000	If my step sizes were 0.25, it would say, well, the first point in my interval is zero, the next point in my interval is going to be zero plus 0.25, and then 0.25 plus 0.25 then 0.5 plus 0.25 and then 0.75 plus 0.25.
426000	442000	Put it in as many of those step sizes as possible into the interval that you have chosen. And then, from there, all we do is compute our depending on what vocabulary we might have come across in the past.
442000	455000	This is our slope right it's the change in why, which is these two, this difference, divided by the change in X, and since the change in X is always this constant step size.
456000	460000	That's your slope, wherever you move across X.
460000	465000	So this is an analogous to kind of that f of X plus H minus f of X over.
465000	468000	Yes, that that would have seen in their calculus book.
468000	479000	Yeah, that's right. That's right. So this part over here is just your f of X part. And then this is your f of X plus H part.
479000	492000	So what this function then does is, it returns back to me, the user, all the X's that I used, and all the slopes that I'm getting at the various X points.
492000	503000	Okay, so it's really, it's like a collection for every point in samples you're getting the slope of one of these secants and it's returning to you, kind of a list of slopes.
503000	516000	Yeah, so we can see run here. And so I can pass in, let's just say a very simple function like X squared.
516000	525000	And let's just say that I wanted to move in quarter style size increments over the interval zero to four.
525000	537000	And so what it will give back to me, and I will put this into two variables, X's and we'll call these slopes.
537000	547000	And so now we'll take a look at what our X's are. So our X's basically are the zero, the quarter, the half, three quarters, so on and so forth.
547000	551000	And we'll see what our slopes are.
551000	570000	So the slopes here. And this is sort of the thing that we can do by hand, just to verify if we wanted to, where this slope here of a quarter is basically saying, Okay, well, I was at f of zero.
570000	590000	And my delta H. So if we think about our formula, right, it might be easier to simply see this as our derivative formula, right, we can do f of X plus H minus f of X divided by H.
590000	599000	Right, that's our without the limits, we haven't talked about limits. So this is just
600000	616000	So if you if we take a look at where this 0.25 comes from. Well, that should be a matter of my doubt my age here is 0.25 everywhere I went. So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to say, Well,
616000	631000	I've got X plus a quarter squared minus X squared. And then all of this is divided by H.
631000	644000	And so if I set my X to be equal zero to zero, this first point here, and I set my H to equal the zero to 0.25.
644000	648000	We haven't done this so we'll see if all the conditions are correct.
648000	660000	We get 0.25 very nice. And then what we can do is we can just change where our starting location was so let's just say that our starting location is this half.
660000	677000	So if the starting location is a half, then what I'm going to have here is 0.75 squared minus 0.5 squared but still divided by 0.25. And here, I get my one and a quarter.
677000	682000	It's nice, even though you put in a function like x squared so it's this parabola.
682000	695000	The slopes have this, you know, really pleasing pattern they're going up by five tenths every time right from 0.25 to 0.75 to right so they're, they're increasing linearly.
695000	697000	Yeah, that's right.
697000	704000	And I can just do one more thing just to make sure that let's see.
704000	722000	So what we'll do here is we'll do a simple plot of my exes against my slopes, just to see what that looks like to your point right like, if these are always moving up by 0.5 that shows up right here in our function.
722000	731000	So that is a graph because at every, so at every x we're associating a number. Really, we made a new function.
731000	741000	That's right. Yeah. Yeah, we basically said that our, our initial function x squared wherever it was.
741000	758000	When, when we were looking at this type of difference divided by this age, and we did it everywhere along its graph, we find, interestingly, a very simple and pleasing and easy to understand function.
758000	780000	Yeah, yeah. Excellent. So, so what would you want to play with next right so you started out with a pretty simple function. Yeah, so we started with a simple one. Now, what I would do want to do is, I'm going to go ahead and, and also just put a little plug in for having all of this stuff done in one step.
780000	804000	Right, so now that we've seen like how this mechanically works step by step, we'll just skip ahead to a general way of looking at this where what I do here is I name my function that I'm that my function of interest so what function would you like John about that.
804000	824000	So x times cosine of x. All right, x times cosine of x. So there's x times cosine of x and then for display purposes, we'll, we'll just write that guy. Okay. And maybe we can go over what the full period of cosine.
824000	825000	Sure.
825000	827000	From zero to two pi.
827000	830000	Or maybe four pi could we do kind of.
830000	832000	Yeah.
833000	840000	The interval zero to four pi. So that'll give us to, or maybe, well, who knows, it's x times cosine.
840000	853000	It's going to look a little bit different. And so what we're going to do is, you know, to make this look smooth and nice, we have to actually sample this interval in enough spots, just to show what the function looks like.
853000	862000	But we're going to, you know, the way we did it earlier here was we picked us a fixed step size of a quarter.
862000	875000	And what I do want to show us is what happens when how much this derivative or this difference that we're talking about this difference quotient that we're talking about depends and what it looks like when we change our step size.
875000	887000	And it's not just a quarter, but it could be a varying length. So I chose step sizes of two units, a unit of one, a half, a 10th, and then 10 to the negative fifth.
887000	894000	Excellent. So for me, that feels like it really duplicates kind of the thought process of Newton and Leibniz.
894000	905000	Yeah, kind of going from these different quotients that people have been computing for hundreds of years to this their imagination of the kind of this infinite test model.
905000	917000	That's right. Yeah, so we can make that that delta H smaller and smaller and smaller. And so here what we'll do is, we're just going to run this everything else after this part is just plotting.
917000	934000	And you'll notice that I am calling my function dy dx. That's the function that we made up earlier, where it will take in x times cosine of x, it'll take in the step sizes that we chose, and then it'll take in the interval that we decided on.
934000	942000	Excellent. And here we go, let's take a look and see what happens to do to do. All right.
942000	949000	So, we've got a bunch of things and should I zoom in a little bit.
949000	956000	Maybe see, it gets a little finicky with the zoom. All right.
956000	960000	So what the heck are we looking at.
960000	964000	Yeah, so that initial step size.
964000	968000	It looks almost like it just kind of a piecewise linear.
968000	979000	Yeah, yeah. So that's this orange, right? It's, it's, in some sense, it's poor sampling, if we were thinking in terms of this derivative that we haven't yet talked about.
979000	997000	But in another sense, it's actually, it's, there's nothing wrong with it. It is, it is our secant line. It is telling me that x times cosine of x from zero to two kind of changes like this orange line here.
997000	1000000	Fairly flat.
1000000	1004000	And then from two to four.
1004000	1009000	Well, it's saying that just because of the way it got sampled.
1009000	1016000	It's changing like this and then there's another change like that.
1016000	1025000	This is positive. Right. So, and then, or this is increasing and then it goes to positive and this is decreasing and goes to negative eventually.
1025000	1031000	Yeah, that's actually a little surprising you would have thought.
1031000	1040000	Yeah, yeah. So thinking about where the zero line is, we can kind of see where it's crossing over. Yeah.
1040000	1050000	Yeah. And I mean, part of this is just, just an issue with sampling. And also maybe just the fact that these are fairly large movements.
1050000	1060000	But who knows what it's actually getting because it, it had to look at this point, and then this point, and then it took a look at this point.
1060000	1074000	And I guess this point and maybe it should have been decreasing but it isn't. But yeah, something something's happening here for sure, in terms of how it got sampled.
1074000	1079000	Although the other thing that strikes me is kind of how quickly it converges.
1079000	1094000	Yeah, so this isn't too bad right like we don't need really need to get very very fine. But you do notice that there are some differences between even a step size of one or a step size of a half.
1094000	1105000	It's right around a 10th where you can't tell the visual difference and it's only because this function is fairly smooth. It doesn't have these steep movements.
1105000	1110000	That steep movements than a 10th just still might not be enough.
1110000	1116000	I imagine the kind of data that you come across could be seriously chaotic.
1116000	1120000	I would say that it's hard to even put a function to it.
1120000	1137000	So, you know, there you do have to always either worry about where you're sampling the data or how you're sampling it or how you're conditioned and also the data tends to be very high dimensional so you're almost never working with f of x, you're
1137000	1151000	working with f of x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 up to like x500 and then you're trying to make sense of what a derivative in any one direction even means.
1151000	1167000	So it makes but there's so much stuff about it that makes sense right like that it, it has kind of this periodic feel like the original function did, which it feels like the slope should be doing but the slopes are kind of increasing an amplitude as the function kind of changes
1167000	1168000	more rapidly.
1168000	1169000	Yep.
1169000	1173000	So I feel like it kind of gets it to feel really quickly.
1173000	1192000	Yeah, it does and if you notice, you know, if we ignore the orange to the whatever color this is, but we look at, you know, the, the sharper brown or purple, depending on how it shows up on the screen, you'll notice, you know, right here.
1192000	1200000	It's about zero the derivative is about zero. And that kind of makes sense because the function has peaked over here.
1200000	1201000	Right.
1201000	1207000	So this is where we're going next we're going to be using this idea about trying to find the zeros of the derivative.
1207000	1210000	Right. Right.
1210000	1218000	And so you'll also notice here where the function has reached some type of minimum, or it's about to change direction.
1218000	1224000	The orange curve, you know, is sitting on zero.
1224000	1230000	It's decreasing slopes negative changes to increasing and has to cross zero in between.
1230000	1233000	Yeah, that's right.
1233000	1242000	So why I like this is because it allows you to, you know, when your first when I remember when I was first learning calculus.
1242000	1247000	This was before the Python even existed, I think.
1247000	1253000	So, so the challenge there was you had to do it on paper.
1253000	1262000	You had to write out inputs and outputs, and do the delta calculations by yourself and if you wanted to actually see what a derivative look like.
1262000	1278000	You really had to do maybe 50 of these by hand, punching it into the calculator of point one steps point one steps point one steps because these steps were too course and you couldn't get a sense of what the derivative ought to look like.
1279000	1283000	Oh, interesting. Well, is there a function you'd like to see in this?
1283000	1301000	Well, you know what I always like to do is I like taking a look at trig functions, but with a little bit of a twist sometimes like we can do cosine of two times e to the x.
1301000	1303000	Wow.
1303000	1314000	And what's fun about these guys is, let's see if it renders correctly.
1314000	1321000	We'll see if this works. Again, this is all on the fly demos. We'll see what happens here.
1321000	1323000	Oh dear.
1323000	1324000	Whoa.
1324000	1330000	Because, and so now this is kind of fun for at least the way I think about it.
1330000	1337000	On the one hand, did I, did I screw up the function?
1337000	1344000	Cosine of two times e to the x.
1344000	1349000	Yeah, cosine of two times e to the x.
1349000	1353000	Does this make sense?
1353000	1361000	Oh, well, the, what we're seeing are the slopes, right? So that's not showing it up because that's right. It's going up to 200,000.
1361000	1362000	That's right.
1362000	1364000	So the slopes are getting crazy.
1364000	1365000	Yeah.
1365000	1372000	The function itself would be down so close to the x axis that we can't even see it.
1372000	1376000	Yeah. And this is why it's kind of fun.
1376000	1385000	Because we know that cosine of blah should be bound between negative one and one.
1385000	1400000	But even this like benign interval that we chose zero to, to four pi has proven to be problematic because
1400000	1403000	we're going through so many different oscillations.
1403000	1404000	Yeah.
1404000	1408000	And it doesn't know anymore.
1408000	1415000	This function is just changing up and down so quickly, even though it's just bound between zero and one.
1415000	1422000	So what would it, what do you think would happen if we did the interval from just like zero to one or 0.5.
1422000	1425000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great.
1425000	1427000	So zero to one.
1427000	1429000	Let's try that one.
1429000	1430000	All right.
1430000	1437000	We're in somewhat sane land, but this doesn't capture a cosine.
1437000	1438000	Yeah.
1438000	1445000	Well, but it sort of makes sense that it shouldn't because you have that e to the x in there.
1445000	1451000	That's just allowing this oscillation. You're just running through periods very quickly.
1451000	1460000	But what's also nice though is, you know, it doesn't even matter if you didn't know that this was, that this was a cosine of, of 2x.
1460000	1467000	What you do know is that it's a cosine function and at the end of the day, you're given this blue curve.
1467000	1472000	And we're trying to figure out, well, how is this blue curve changing.
1472000	1475000	We know it's decreasing.
1475000	1478000	Then it flattens out.
1478000	1481000	And then it starts increasing again.
1481000	1489000	And, and so if we look at this, this brown curve, we'll see that.
1489000	1493000	Well, that difference quotient, right, is negative.
1493000	1504000	But it starts to increase away towards zero because this rate is slowing down.
1504000	1510000	And where this function bottoms out is where this difference quotient goes to zero.
1510000	1517000	And now the function is increasing again. And that's what these positive values here mean.
1517000	1525000	Oh, so I was, I was, at first I was surprised how high, like the, it doesn't look like the slope should be four at that point.
1525000	1526000	Right.
1526000	1534000	Then I noticed that like an only kind of changing two 10s, like from 0.6 to 0.8, it went up almost a whole value.
1534000	1535000	Yeah.
1535000	1543000	Right. So it's actually, if we think about that as a rate, right, so it went up one and 0.2 that would be like five and one.
1543000	1546000	That's right. That's right.
1546000	1555000	Yeah, so it does capture like, I mean, that is the purpose of these different quotients is to capture that, that rate of change.
1555000	1556000	Yeah.
1556000	1564000	All right, so if I'm being too, too needy, let me know, but yeah, I would love to see it on a slightly bigger interval.
1564000	1575000	Yeah, yeah, no, not needy doll that this is sort of the nice thing about having like a program that you can just kind of fiddle around with so we can go to zero to two if that helps and see what happens.
1575000	1579000	Oh, nice.
1579000	1598000	So yeah, now this is interesting, because I mean, it's the function is decreasing. Therefore, these rates are negative. And then here's where it flattened out so this rate is zero.
1598000	1602000	Instantaneously so the function isn't changing right at that moment.
1602000	1617000	And then from wherever this is maybe three eighths, all the way out to here, one and I don't know an eighth.
1617000	1630000	The function is increasing but we can see that the rate at which it's increasing starts to slow down and then eventually the function turns away and and starts to decrease.
1630000	1632000	Yeah, very, very interesting.
1632000	1643000	But because because there's a cosine in here there's this periodicity that the e to the x argument inside is making things go faster and faster.
1643000	1647000	So this behavior is starting to become more and more wild.
1647000	1653000	Because even though it's just going back and forth between one and negative one. It's doing it in a shorter and shorter time.
1653000	1656000	Yeah, yeah.
1656000	1673000	So if we were to take a look at something like even just the interval from three to four. And for the time being, let's just let's just actually not take a look at what these difference quotients look like.
1673000	1678000	Let's just take a look at what this function looks like.
1678000	1687000	So this is I took away the derivatives and just looking at our function of interest.
1687000	1700000	Yeah, yeah, I was just trying to think what must those folks be like so in like in 200s that's going from negative one to one.
1700000	1703000	So even even by that point.
1703000	1705000	Right. So, right.
1705000	1708000	That's got to be like a slope of almost 100.
1708000	1709000	Yep.
1709000	1710000	Yep.
1710000	1711000	Yeah.
1711000	1729000	So this is yeah maybe. Yeah, that's right. Like there are multiple movements from negative one to one, just within 3.8 to four. So, if you imagine, and which it's not true, but if you just imagine that we have three periods in here.
1729000	1735000	Within 0.2 that's 0.06 width per period.
1735000	1752000	Yeah, and it's moving a distance of two so two divided by 0.06 is we're hitting what 200 over six so 3035 something.
1752000	1763000	And just as quickly as it went up 35 and dropped by 35, a rate of 35 so that's why before we saw this cone that
1763000	1767000	which is a really interesting shape.
1767000	1768000	All right.
1768000	1776000	Well I want to be respectful of your time, but but I know you mentioned that you also wrote a tangent line finding program.
1776000	1796000	Yeah, so yeah we can we can certainly do this. Let's take a look at what that looks like. So there are some classical questions that are often asked in a calculus course right and one of these questions is given a function f and an x coordinate, which will
1796000	1813000	call this guy point x. We often are the question is, what's the equation of the line tangent to my function at that particular point. So, if we if we come back to this guy here.
1813000	1822000	Let's just take a look at something a little bit more tame in an interval that's a little bit more tame.
1823000	1834000	Just for a moment. This is, and it's clearly not cosine of it is
1834000	1837000	it's x squared.
1837000	1858000	So, here, often we're interested in, you know, if I picked a point here and tried to draw a line that was parallel to the curve in some way whatever parallel means, this is often what we're interested in terms of a tangent line.
1858000	1871000	So there is a line that we call tangent, and we'd be interested in saying like, okay, I know that at this point, the slope the instantaneous rate of change at this point to some value.
1871000	1877000	And if I know at some value, can I make a line that is tangent.
1877000	1882000	Having that slope that is equal to
1882000	1890000	the, the rate of change instantaneously at that on the curve there.
1890000	1894000	And so, to do this.
1894000	1899000	You know, the standard setup here is that we have
1899000	1907000	minus the point of interest equals m times x minus the point of interest that's our equation of a line.
1907000	1925000	I forget what this is called in classes is point slope form slope for me. Yeah. Yeah. So, in point slope form, you're given x zero, which means if you know x zero and you know the function, you can always find y zero by substituting x zero into the function.
1925000	1941000	If you have those, then all we have to do is figure out what m is. And in, in the world of calculus m is the slope and the slope here is the derivative.
1941000	1954000	So, this function here doesn't necessarily compute a derivative the way we would do in a calculus course which is by hand and saying like okay x squared to become two x's and then what have you.
1954000	1978000	I simply reuse that derivative function that I wrote above dy dx and take in the function taken the step size, and then I will give it the points of interest, or the interval of interest and then from this I, I get back my slope, the two points, my x zero and y zero and then for convenience I just
1978000	1982000	give myself what the equation of the line is automatically.
1982000	1999000	So this is finding a tangent line. And so we can do the same here, where we can pick a function like x squared.
1999000	2016000	Maybe we want to know what the slope of the tangent line is at the value of x equals two. And for convenience and simplicity I'll just make an interval around that point, one point, one unit before one unit after.
2016000	2028000	We'll have to sample that interval enough so that we can actually visualize the function well. And then over here is me running my find the tangent line function.
2028000	2039000	But again at various step sizes, just to get a sense of at what point do I get to my tangent line.
2039000	2048000	So doing this, let's make sure that I've got it right. Again demo runs. Here we go.
2048000	2058000	So what we can see here is, you know, we've got a thick blue line that I made just to show what x squared looks like.
2058000	2071000	This black dot is the point of interest where I want to know what my equation of the tangent line is. And then we have various lines that were drawn, depending on the step size that we chose.
2071000	2089000	When I had a step size of two. Well, it had to sample the function at x equals two and then at x equals four. And then it said well okay at x equals two my value is two and at x equals four my value is 16.
2089000	2101000	So 16 minus four is 12 and then 12 divided by two is my slope of six. That's what the six here means.
2101000	2108000	Nice. And so again we see kind of that increasing accuracy.
2108000	2121000	Interesting. Even jumping from one tenth to what would that be 100,000. Yeah, right. We really only gain an extra 10th of accuracy in the slow.
2121000	2123000	Yeah.
2123000	2134000	The result here is, you know, dependent on the type of function that we have x squared is nicely enough behaved that going from a 10th to 100,000.
2134000	2146000	You know, you get that one place of accuracy but if you had a function that changed very steeply very quickly, then even that movement of a 10th could be horribly inaccurate.
2146000	2163000	I'm sure that cosine of e to the x function, right. Yeah, that'd be a disastrous. Yeah. And that's actually like why I like to look at some of those really fast changing functions because one thing I remember when I was taking my calculus courses.
2163000	2170000	We never encountered those types of functions in a calculus course, because they're very hard to work with hard to visualize.
2171000	2188000	Yeah, it's a disaster. But now you have this, you know, you have tools at your disposal, I think you use Desmos and Geo Geo Geo and Wolfram Alpha, all of these things I didn't have.
2188000	2196000	You can muck around with this stuff and really get a sense of like, Oh, wow, that's step size.
2196000	2208000	Really, you have to think about it from a computational standpoint from an analytic standpoint. Yes, it's a limit and what have you that I understand you haven't gotten to yet but
2208000	2217000	the idea is kind of out there, right, because we have that idea we want to kind of get good small but we we just haven't formalized it.
2217000	2219000	Yeah.
2219000	2224000	So yeah, so we can see that. Okay, well at exactly this point.
2224000	2232000	Right. I, you know, we have our slope at exactly this point, which is four.
2232000	2243000	And the equation of the line, you can effectively say is y minus four equals four times x minus two. But all of these others, I mean, the truth is, even this is a secant line.
2243000	2247000	It's just a very, very, very short secant line.
2247000	2270000	Depending on how big your step is, the estimate for the rate of change at exactly this point varies and, you know, what we think is a tangent line, given a step size of two is going to be a little bit different when that step size changes to
2270000	2273000	something appropriately small. Yeah, yeah.
2273000	2278000	That's the right way to say appropriately small.
2278000	2294000	Well, I just can't thank you enough this was so cool to kind of see to be able to see the computation happening, right for for things that we've been talking about and we can kind of see the results of these computations when we're using Desmos, but that's
2294000	2297000	different than kind of being able to see inside the code.
2297000	2301000	Yeah, it's fun. Yeah, I really appreciate that.
2301000	2311000	Can I show you one more thing? Is that okay? Oh yeah. Yeah, so the other nice thing here is if we come back to this derivative calculation or this dy dx thing.
2311000	2321000	We can also have fun functions like absolute value of x right.
2321000	2327000	Now this is kind of fun in a lot of other ways. And I'm going to go over the interval negative two to two.
2327000	2344000	Because we know absolute value of x should look like a V of sorts. And when we do this computationally something fun happens in terms of why that step size matters.
2344000	2346000	Right.
2346000	2357000	This is right here. If we if we were able to zoom in even more we would see that even this is not just a pure vertical line as we would expect it to be.
2357000	2371000	But this is transitioning from a negative slope to a positive slope. And at exactly this point, we don't know what the slope is, because it depends on which way we're looking at it.
2371000	2380000	Because on the one side it's positive and on the other side, it's negative, but that's that's different than that usual like zero we'd expect in between.
2380000	2391000	Yeah, and I like this because it helps understand the smoothness constraint, or the smoothness quality that a derivative tells us about the function.
2391000	2393000	Yeah.
2393000	2398000	Super cool. And it's a very dramatic illustration of the step size.
2398000	2400000	Yeah, yeah, it's fun.
2400000	2409000	So then when you throw this in with like, you know, you put in something like
2409000	2418000	x raised to the absolute value of cosine of x over an interval that would be from negative two to two.
2418000	2423000	This starts to become fun because
2423000	2427000	you have like, you have these sudden changes that happen in the function.
2427000	2436000	Yeah, it's really interesting. And even after we learn some rules, right, that that kind of thing is going to be tricky to evaluate.
2436000	2439000	Yes.
2439000	2443000	So yeah, you have to pay attention to the domain you have to make sure that
2443000	2451000	you're looking at it from the left or you're looking at it from the right or you're looking at it from both directions. And I think this is all the stuff that you're going to get to eventually right.
2451000	2452000	Yeah.
2452000	2453000	Yeah.
2453000	2456000	Anyway, that was the last fun, fun thing.
2456000	2459000	Well, that was good. What a great note to end on.
2459000	2465000	Thank you again. I'll include links to your blog and
2465000	2473000	other materials so that the students are interested. They can see kind of some of the other stuff you do for fun on the side.
2473000	2475000	Yeah, your serious work.
2475000	2478000	Yeah, sounds good. Thanks for having me.
2478000	2481000	Oh, again, just thank you a ton.
