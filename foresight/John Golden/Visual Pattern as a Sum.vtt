00:00.000 --> 00:09.920
So, just a quick video to talk about how we can go from a visual pattern to finding the

00:09.920 --> 00:14.800
answer by writing it as a sum.

00:14.800 --> 00:26.320
So if we want to think about later on how many penguins in, say, step 43, one way to

00:26.320 --> 00:32.760
solve that problem, it'd be to find a direct rule that tells us, okay, how many are going

00:32.760 --> 00:36.640
to be in step two, and step three, and step X.

00:36.640 --> 00:42.600
But the kind of calculus way to think about it is to think about how is it changing.

00:42.600 --> 00:46.640
So here we have two new penguins.

00:46.640 --> 00:54.120
Here we have three new penguins.

00:54.480 --> 01:04.520
So if I think about that next one, I think the bottom line is going to have five penguins,

01:04.520 --> 01:11.360
and then three, two, one.

01:11.360 --> 01:21.680
So in this case, these are the old penguins, and we're going to have four new penguins.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.360
Okay, well, that's a pretty clear pattern, right?

01:25.360 --> 01:32.240
So in step, we can work out how many new.

01:32.240 --> 01:43.080
So in step two, we had two new, and step three, we had three new, and step four, we have four new.

01:43.080 --> 01:52.000
Oh, that's just exactly how much we're, whatever the step number is.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.360
Okay, so it's the easiest possible one to work out.

01:59.360 --> 02:04.960
So we're going to add up, starting from the second step, we're going to add on as many

02:04.960 --> 02:10.360
as the step number, and then we're going to go up to, like, say, we wanted to know the

02:10.360 --> 02:17.120
43rd, that would be how many steps we add up, and how many did we start with?

02:17.120 --> 02:18.920
We started with two.

02:18.920 --> 02:25.600
So that would tell us how many penguins there were in step 43.

02:25.600 --> 02:31.200
Okay, well, that was a little too easy, so let's try another one just quickly to see.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.280
All right, let's look at this example with how many stars.

02:35.280 --> 02:40.760
So this one is interesting, because I think it would be pretty easy to find a direct rule

02:40.760 --> 02:46.440
for this one, because here in step one, we have two by two grid of stars, an array, right?

02:46.440 --> 02:53.040
We call that in math education, a four by four array of stars, a six by six array of

02:53.040 --> 02:56.600
stars in step three.

02:56.600 --> 03:07.000
So I'm guessing in step n, we'll have a two n by two n, and if we're trying to think about

03:07.000 --> 03:12.240
how many stars that is, that's four n squared, okay?

03:12.240 --> 03:20.200
But maybe it's a good problem with a little more to think about from the sum perspective.

03:20.200 --> 03:26.480
All right, so we want to think about how is it changing, right?

03:26.480 --> 03:32.360
So in the step, how many new stars do we have?

03:32.360 --> 03:46.160
In step two, we've got 12 new stars, and in step three, here was our old one.

03:46.160 --> 03:53.920
We have eight, eight more, 16, 20 new stars.

03:53.920 --> 04:01.200
In step four, we're going to add on two more rows out here.

04:01.200 --> 04:09.880
So we're going to have 12 more, and then 12 more, and then four more in the corner.

04:09.880 --> 04:22.360
So 28, so it goes up eight, it goes up eight, oh, well that would make it pretty easy, right?

04:22.360 --> 04:26.560
So the next time I'm predicting it'll go up 36, right?

04:26.560 --> 04:39.040
Because it will have kind of an eight by two block, so it'll go up 16, 16, and the four.

04:39.040 --> 04:45.200
So that's where the eight's coming from, from 12 to 16, it's going up four, and then those

04:45.200 --> 04:49.800
four new, and then the four new in the corner, okay?

04:49.800 --> 05:00.160
So if I want to find a rule for this, it's going to be eight times something, right?

05:00.160 --> 05:06.600
So if I think about the eight times the step number, that would be 16, I would have to

05:06.600 --> 05:08.600
subtract four.

05:08.600 --> 05:13.800
Eight times the step number, that would be 24, I have to subtract four.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.240
Eight times the step number, 32.

05:17.240 --> 05:27.200
So this is our pattern, which means the new blocks in step n are going to be eight times

05:27.200 --> 05:30.800
n minus four.

05:30.800 --> 05:41.760
So to write our sum, we've got four blocks in that first step, and then we want to add

05:41.760 --> 05:55.480
from n equals two up to whatever we're adding to, eight times our step number minus the four.

05:55.480 --> 06:04.240
And that would be another way of writing down the total number of blocks, okay?

06:04.240 --> 06:10.640
So one thing I notice is that when n is equal to one, this would be eight minus four, which

06:10.640 --> 06:12.360
is the four.

06:12.360 --> 06:18.680
So in this case, step zero would have zero blocks, and we could write the whole thing

06:18.680 --> 06:26.720
n equals one to whatever we want to add it up to of eight n minus four, and then that

06:26.720 --> 06:33.360
gives us our sum to find the total number of stars.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.120
Thanks very much.
