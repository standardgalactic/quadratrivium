0	9920	So, just a quick video to talk about how we can go from a visual pattern to finding the
9920	14800	answer by writing it as a sum.
14800	26320	So if we want to think about later on how many penguins in, say, step 43, one way to
26320	32760	solve that problem, it'd be to find a direct rule that tells us, okay, how many are going
32760	36640	to be in step two, and step three, and step X.
36640	42600	But the kind of calculus way to think about it is to think about how is it changing.
42600	46640	So here we have two new penguins.
46640	54120	Here we have three new penguins.
54480	64520	So if I think about that next one, I think the bottom line is going to have five penguins,
64520	71360	and then three, two, one.
71360	81680	So in this case, these are the old penguins, and we're going to have four new penguins.
82120	85360	Okay, well, that's a pretty clear pattern, right?
85360	92240	So in step, we can work out how many new.
92240	103080	So in step two, we had two new, and step three, we had three new, and step four, we have four new.
103080	112000	Oh, that's just exactly how much we're, whatever the step number is.
112000	119360	Okay, so it's the easiest possible one to work out.
119360	124960	So we're going to add up, starting from the second step, we're going to add on as many
124960	130360	as the step number, and then we're going to go up to, like, say, we wanted to know the
130360	137120	43rd, that would be how many steps we add up, and how many did we start with?
137120	138920	We started with two.
138920	145600	So that would tell us how many penguins there were in step 43.
145600	151200	Okay, well, that was a little too easy, so let's try another one just quickly to see.
151200	155280	All right, let's look at this example with how many stars.
155280	160760	So this one is interesting, because I think it would be pretty easy to find a direct rule
160760	166440	for this one, because here in step one, we have two by two grid of stars, an array, right?
166440	173040	We call that in math education, a four by four array of stars, a six by six array of
173040	176600	stars in step three.
176600	187000	So I'm guessing in step n, we'll have a two n by two n, and if we're trying to think about
187000	192240	how many stars that is, that's four n squared, okay?
192240	200200	But maybe it's a good problem with a little more to think about from the sum perspective.
200200	206480	All right, so we want to think about how is it changing, right?
206480	212360	So in the step, how many new stars do we have?
212360	226160	In step two, we've got 12 new stars, and in step three, here was our old one.
226160	233920	We have eight, eight more, 16, 20 new stars.
233920	241200	In step four, we're going to add on two more rows out here.
241200	249880	So we're going to have 12 more, and then 12 more, and then four more in the corner.
249880	262360	So 28, so it goes up eight, it goes up eight, oh, well that would make it pretty easy, right?
262360	266560	So the next time I'm predicting it'll go up 36, right?
266560	279040	Because it will have kind of an eight by two block, so it'll go up 16, 16, and the four.
279040	285200	So that's where the eight's coming from, from 12 to 16, it's going up four, and then those
285200	289800	four new, and then the four new in the corner, okay?
289800	300160	So if I want to find a rule for this, it's going to be eight times something, right?
300160	306600	So if I think about the eight times the step number, that would be 16, I would have to
306600	308600	subtract four.
308600	313800	Eight times the step number, that would be 24, I have to subtract four.
313800	317240	Eight times the step number, 32.
317240	327200	So this is our pattern, which means the new blocks in step n are going to be eight times
327200	330800	n minus four.
330800	341760	So to write our sum, we've got four blocks in that first step, and then we want to add
341760	355480	from n equals two up to whatever we're adding to, eight times our step number minus the four.
355480	364240	And that would be another way of writing down the total number of blocks, okay?
364240	370640	So one thing I notice is that when n is equal to one, this would be eight minus four, which
370640	372360	is the four.
372360	378680	So in this case, step zero would have zero blocks, and we could write the whole thing
378680	386720	n equals one to whatever we want to add it up to of eight n minus four, and then that
386720	393360	gives us our sum to find the total number of stars.
393360	394120	Thanks very much.
