1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
So, just a quick video to talk about how we can go from a visual pattern to finding the

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,800
answer by writing it as a sum.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:26,320
So if we want to think about later on how many penguins in, say, step 43, one way to

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,760
solve that problem, it'd be to find a direct rule that tells us, okay, how many are going

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,640
to be in step two, and step three, and step X.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,600
But the kind of calculus way to think about it is to think about how is it changing.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,640
So here we have two new penguins.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,120
Here we have three new penguins.

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:04,520
So if I think about that next one, I think the bottom line is going to have five penguins,

10
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:11,360
and then three, two, one.

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:21,680
So in this case, these are the old penguins, and we're going to have four new penguins.

12
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,360
Okay, well, that's a pretty clear pattern, right?

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,240
So in step, we can work out how many new.

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:43,080
So in step two, we had two new, and step three, we had three new, and step four, we have four new.

15
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, that's just exactly how much we're, whatever the step number is.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,360
Okay, so it's the easiest possible one to work out.

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,960
So we're going to add up, starting from the second step, we're going to add on as many

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,360
as the step number, and then we're going to go up to, like, say, we wanted to know the

19
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,120
43rd, that would be how many steps we add up, and how many did we start with?

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,920
We started with two.

21
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:25,600
So that would tell us how many penguins there were in step 43.

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,200
Okay, well, that was a little too easy, so let's try another one just quickly to see.

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,280
All right, let's look at this example with how many stars.

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,760
So this one is interesting, because I think it would be pretty easy to find a direct rule

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,440
for this one, because here in step one, we have two by two grid of stars, an array, right?

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,040
We call that in math education, a four by four array of stars, a six by six array of

27
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,600
stars in step three.

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:07,000
So I'm guessing in step n, we'll have a two n by two n, and if we're trying to think about

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,240
how many stars that is, that's four n squared, okay?

30
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:20,200
But maybe it's a good problem with a little more to think about from the sum perspective.

31
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,480
All right, so we want to think about how is it changing, right?

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,360
So in the step, how many new stars do we have?

33
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:46,160
In step two, we've got 12 new stars, and in step three, here was our old one.

34
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:53,920
We have eight, eight more, 16, 20 new stars.

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,200
In step four, we're going to add on two more rows out here.

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,880
So we're going to have 12 more, and then 12 more, and then four more in the corner.

37
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:22,360
So 28, so it goes up eight, it goes up eight, oh, well that would make it pretty easy, right?

38
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,560
So the next time I'm predicting it'll go up 36, right?

39
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:39,040
Because it will have kind of an eight by two block, so it'll go up 16, 16, and the four.

40
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,200
So that's where the eight's coming from, from 12 to 16, it's going up four, and then those

41
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,800
four new, and then the four new in the corner, okay?

42
00:04:49,800 --> 00:05:00,160
So if I want to find a rule for this, it's going to be eight times something, right?

43
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,600
So if I think about the eight times the step number, that would be 16, I would have to

44
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
subtract four.

45
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,800
Eight times the step number, that would be 24, I have to subtract four.

46
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,240
Eight times the step number, 32.

47
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:27,200
So this is our pattern, which means the new blocks in step n are going to be eight times

48
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,800
n minus four.

49
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:41,760
So to write our sum, we've got four blocks in that first step, and then we want to add

50
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:55,480
from n equals two up to whatever we're adding to, eight times our step number minus the four.

51
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:04,240
And that would be another way of writing down the total number of blocks, okay?

52
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,640
So one thing I notice is that when n is equal to one, this would be eight minus four, which

53
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,360
is the four.

54
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,680
So in this case, step zero would have zero blocks, and we could write the whole thing

55
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:26,720
n equals one to whatever we want to add it up to of eight n minus four, and then that

56
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,360
gives us our sum to find the total number of stars.

57
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,120
Thanks very much.
