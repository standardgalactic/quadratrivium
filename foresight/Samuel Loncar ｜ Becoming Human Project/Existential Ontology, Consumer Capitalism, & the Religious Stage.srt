00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,360
Hi, welcome to this episode 7 of my series on Seren Kierkegaard, The Poet of Existence.

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,280
This is the third and final episode on Kierkegaard's theory of the stages.

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,880
I covered the aesthetic in episode 5, the ethical stage in the last episode, episode

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,880
6.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,600
Today I will discuss the complexities of the religious phase, and that will lead into

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,960
my concluding lecture, and that concluding lecture, when it publishes, will be the launch

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,240
date of my audio course sponsor in Kierkegaard, which is part 2 of this course.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,080
And if you've appreciated this free material, I would encourage you to check out my website

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,400
and see where it all started with the Becoming Human Origin series, which lays out my general

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,160
vision about philosophy, religion, and science, and why we need a philosophical revolution

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,760
in our own time.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,060
And much of that vision that I lay out that came after over a decade of my own work in

13
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,480
graduate school was birthed originally in my study of Seren Kierkegaard.

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,160
And so as I've mentioned in this series, Kierkegaard is a personally very important person for my

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,520
life as a philosopher.

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,320
He changed my life, he transformed my life, and he, in a way, damaged my life.

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,760
I don't blame him for it.

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,080
It's not his fault, but I had a nervous breakdown connected with his work as the occasion.

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,020
There's a lot of, I guess, light changing there.

20
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,280
And the reality of Kierkegaard's importance is why I'm bringing this series to the public

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,280
and why I wanted to make this introductory part of it free, because Kierkegaard is someone

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,160
who's so important that whether you ever read him or not, I hope you've seen that we can

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,040
learn a great deal about our own lives and about the history of philosophy, of religion,

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,680
and theology.

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,560
And so today we're going to take on this huge topic, and this is a very difficult topic,

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,040
which is the religious phase.

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,600
And how are we going to approach it?

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,160
In the last lecture, I gave a fairly tightly structured presentation of the ethical phase

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,680
in relationship to fear and trembling.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,120
And what I want to do in this lecture, and particularly because the nature of this episode

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,000
as a transition to the series finale, and that series finale is then the origin of the

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,160
new second part of the series in the audio course, is I want to explain what we don't

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,400
understand about the religious phase and why we don't understand it.

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,200
And that's about as good as one can do with the religious phase.

35
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,520
And I'll explain why that is in the course of it.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,600
So in order to do that, to kind of give this seemingly negative, but I hope it's going

37
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,200
to be very positive and illuminating presentation of the religious stage, we have to understand

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,520
why we don't really understand it.

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,120
And that should begin to make some sense existentially.

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,360
So I want to introduce the framework of the significance of what we don't understand in

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,760
relationship to the significance of what we can't understand.

42
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,000
And in order to do that, I'm going to start by characterizing what I would just broadly

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,520
call existential ontology.

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,720
And that's always one of those $10 philosophy words that just comes from two pretty common

45
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,480
Greek words in philosophy, ontos, which is a word that comes from a participial form

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,960
of being refers to existing things, being things.

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,840
And so the on top, for example, in ancient Greek philosophy are an existing thing or

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,080
the existing thing in the neutral case.

49
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,840
And this is a very important word from which we then get ontology, ontology, which is the

50
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,480
discourse or interlogic or rationale of the things that exist.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,680
And there's a technical distinction that sometimes emerges between metaphysics and ontology,

52
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,480
but I would contend this distinction is either very clear in the minds of the one using it

53
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,320
and useful, or it's not clear at all, and it's usually not clear.

54
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,320
And therefore it's very unproductive.

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,320
So when I say ontology, I'm not distinguishing it from metaphysics as a field or a category.

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,720
I'm rather referring to a specific heightened focus in metaphysical reflection, which is

57
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,840
on things under the aspect of their being things and of their being existing things.

58
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,280
And what we'll see very briefly, I can't explain this because it's not a metaphysics course,

59
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,560
is there's actually a tension between the idea of a thing and the idea of existing.

60
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,360
And so existing things are a very pregnant philosophical category, and they're very important

61
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,000
to Kierkegaard.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,280
And we may think of existential ontology primarily in terms of Heidegger, but even though as

63
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,160
you know, I have some modest expertise in Heidegger's work, I don't think Heidegger's

64
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,680
a really good ontologist in any sense.

65
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,540
And I don't find his ideas about ontology particularly useful as a framework.

66
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,760
So when I talk about existential ontology, my dad started Kierkegaard into the medieval

67
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,880
tradition, and then to my own development of those ideas.

68
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,600
So you could say, Sam, why does this matter?

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,120
Well, let me ask you a question.

70
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,200
Are you an existing thing?

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,160
This is a very important question.

72
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,520
And the aesthetic phase and the ethical phase have two very different perspectives on this

73
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,000
question and the sort of question that this is.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,280
Now let me explain what may seem very enigmatic.

75
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,280
First of all, there's a type of perspective in human life that you may live through.

76
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,280
You may be inside of currently, you may know people who are inside of it, or you may read

77
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,040
books that depict it or that portray it unintentionally.

78
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,680
In this perspective, the person looking at the world is a person looking at a world full

79
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,440
of things.

80
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,000
And those things are seen in fundamental contrast with themselves.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,720
They view themselves as fundamentally a viewer, an observer, someone looking in upon something

82
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,040
that they are separate from.

83
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,480
Now this is the perspective of a person who generally considers themselves to be particular,

84
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,960
to be existing.

85
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,800
And an existing is a manner or a mode, but it's not a manner or a mode of equality.

86
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,960
So it's very difficult to describe.

87
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
This is the metaphysical part.

88
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,200
In other words, if I say you're running, we understand running as this kind of, it could

89
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,320
be a gerund or participle, but we're using the participle sense in English grammar, the

90
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,120
idea of an active, ongoing, verbal process, something's happening.

91
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,760
This ongoing, active process of running is a process, and we can say what quality it's

92
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
a process of.

93
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,720
It's a quality of running or the capacity to run when it's actualized.

94
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,080
You could say it's manifest in this state of existence, which is the process of running.

95
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
That's actually very important to understand.

96
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,960
This kind of, you can seem very pedantic, but for example, if you read Plato's great

97
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,320
dialogue, the Euthyphro, this type of apparently subtle and meaningless grammatical distinctions

98
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,280
in language are very important for making clear certain distinctions about existence.

99
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,480
So there's a person who looks on the world as full of things, and they feel themselves

100
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,720
to be in contrast to those things real or existing.

101
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,440
And so here's the initial psychological root of the contrast between existence and thingness.

102
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,400
We feel that there's a difference between an existing and a thing.

103
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,160
Now we would say real things are things that exist.

104
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,280
So I have my copy of either or, which I'm going to talk about today in terms of the

105
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,120
ethical stage and the transition to the villages.

106
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,520
But you could say this is a book.

107
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,640
The book is a thing, but Kierkegaard is not a thing.

108
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,680
But we also know Kierkegaard is a thing.

109
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,080
Kierkegaard as a thing is, for example, a kind of fashionable, pretty cool existentialist

110
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,040
philosopher who it's cool to know something about.

111
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,640
I'm very aware of that.

112
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,880
It wasn't why I studied Kierkegaard, but I'm perfectly aware that Kierkegaard, for example,

113
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,400
has a cachet that someone like Gabriel Marcel doesn't have, even if Gabriel Marcel should

114
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,640
be much better known than he is, which he should be.

115
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,040
He's in a way, I think, a very great disciple of Kierkegaard's existential ontology.

116
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,000
But Kierkegaard has cachet, Heidegger has cachet, right?

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,640
And Neil Bruner doesn't have cachet, if you're in theology, compared to Karl Barth.

118
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,640
So there's a thing-ness to this quality of things.

119
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,400
So we know there's a difference between people and things.

120
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,880
We know that some people looking out on the world see the world as primarily things, and

121
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,600
we therefore can now accept something very uncomfortable, which there is a real sense

122
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,840
in which what we call persons have aspects about them that we can't easily separate that

123
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,500
are thing-like, like cool people are a thing.

124
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,620
If you're in a club scene, and you're in LA, or you're in New York, or you're in London,

125
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,700
and you're in society, depending on what that means for you, it means you want to be associated

126
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,820
with whatever the thing is.

127
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,300
If you're in New York and you're part of society, and you don't know what was recently written

128
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,220
in the New York Times, or in the New Yorker, or you're not familiar with what's going on

129
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,620
on Broadway, then you might be considered out of it.

130
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,580
What is a person who's out of it?

131
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,180
They're a person who kind of doesn't know what the things are.

132
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:30,620
What is the thing in a situation is a sense of where there's some gravitation of energy

133
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,260
and objectivity, and we're excited by things.

134
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,140
I can't get into the economic dimension, but you can immediately, I think, begin to understand

135
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,460
that what we call consumer capitalism, you really have to describe in the standpoint

136
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,180
of existential ontology, consumer capitalism is a state of the human being in which it

137
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,060
is fundamentally oriented towards things, but it does not understand what things are.

138
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,340
That's a very simple way of describing consumer capitalism, simple in the sense it's concise,

139
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,940
it's brief to say, but it's profound and difficult to make sense of philosophically.

140
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,740
Sometimes you know what it means, it can seem just no maker, secretive in that sense, but

141
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,740
it's true.

142
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,980
That is what consumer capitalism is, and you need, therefore, a blend of what in contemporary

143
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:17,060
academia we would say is a social psychological standpoint in philosophy, what we would say

144
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,100
is a metaphysical standpoint.

145
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,140
You'll see that for me, as a student and disciple in some ways of Kierkegaard's insights and

146
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,420
person who's built on them throughout my work and career, existential ontology is where

147
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:36,860
metaphysics and history, and metaphysics and sociology, and metaphysics and psychology

148
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,820
converge and are inseparable.

149
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,780
You can't do existential ontology without an actual lived ability to experience and express,

150
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,860
crucially, express the lived experience of the human being.

151
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:56,900
So the seducer sees the person that they seduce as a thing, but the pleasure of the seduction

152
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,420
is in the existence and the existing of the thing.

153
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,940
And there's, therefore, a profound contradiction in seduction between the pleasure that the

154
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,660
seducer gets from seduction and the act of seducing.

155
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,020
The act of seducing as a category requires the reduction of a human being to a category,

156
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,740
and a category becomes a thing.

157
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,340
You can classify, compare, oh, this person was much better than this person.

158
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,940
That's what I call sex.

159
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,940
And in my philosophy of eros, I always tell people I don't believe in sex.

160
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,740
Sex to me is like a religion, and it's one I don't subscribe to.

161
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,180
Not that I don't enjoy eros or intimacy, but I don't, that's not sex.

162
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,180
Sex is the opposite of intimacy.

163
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,860
So I can't get into this here, but this is connected to a development of the seducer.

164
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,100
The seducer is a person who's interested in sex, and sex is connected to power.

165
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,740
And power is connected in the sexual way, specifically with domination.

166
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,900
And domination and sexuality converges towards the whole categories of crimes for which we

167
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,980
know very well the proper words.

168
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,820
And one of the reasons our culture is very conflicted about how to deal with those horrible

169
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,140
crimes is because in reality, they're so pervasive.

170
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:15,380
And the pervasiveness has to do with the conjunction of sexual appetite and thinghood.

171
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:22,500
And if you become erotically attracted to things, when you're with people, the part

172
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,060
of you that's attracted to them will always be in a type of contradiction, because part

173
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,980
of you is attracted to the actual unique individual in front of you.

174
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,980
And to the extent that you're not attracted to them, you're having to ignore their literal

175
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
uniqueness.

176
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,940
You have to ignore their person, not look in their eyes, not think about how they're

177
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,620
going to feel the next day, not think about how you know you're going to treat them after

178
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,300
you're done with them.

179
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,680
And so there you have to think of them.

180
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,700
And then you maybe focus exclusively, not that it's not natural to be attracted to a

181
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,780
beautiful body, for example, but the seducer focuses exclusively on the qualities of the

182
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,220
person that can be think of, that they can enjoy, that they can contemplate the person's

183
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,460
social relations, maybe they're from a very wealthy family, and the seducer is excited

184
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:12,140
to have access to this, or to know that they're in the 19th century, highly gendered form

185
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,140
of seduction.

186
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,180
Kierkegaard is depicting that they're deflowering some daughter of a noble family.

187
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,980
That's a very, you could say, wicked from the Kierkegaard's cultural morals standpoint.

188
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,840
But today, that's less the issue in seduction is not a particular gendered thing.

189
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:35,560
But seduction is this thingification of the erotic and therefore the sexualization, you

190
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,560
could say, of existing ontology.

191
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,600
So the existing thing distinction actually is organic to everything we've been doing

192
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,080
in the stages.

193
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:51,320
The aesthetic person desires deeply to be unique.

194
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,240
They consciously feel this desire, and they want to be extraordinary.

195
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,680
And I'll read in a bit of time from this very powerful passage, near the end of either

196
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,880
or by Judge Wilhelm about the desire to be extraordinary, because this sets up the religious

197
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
phase.

198
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:14,160
Now, you said, Sam, okay, you're thinking, why does this have anything to do with understanding

199
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
the religious?

200
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, I said, I'm going to explain why we can't understand the religious and how that's

201
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,640
related to why we don't understand the religious.

202
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,480
And I said to explain the relationship between things we don't understand and things we can't

203
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,840
understand, we need existential ontology.

204
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:37,080
And so here's the first reality, a person who sees things exclusively as things cannot

205
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,480
ever interpret or understand their existence.

206
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:48,360
A person who sees things exclusively as things cannot ever understand or interpret their existence.

207
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,160
Now I can't get into here why this is connected to nominalism, which is the most misunderstood,

208
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,600
misrepresented position in the history of philosophy.

209
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,960
It's kind of made up position by enemies of the position.

210
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,720
But what the position called nominalism for those who know this term in history of philosophy

211
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,760
ultimately has to do with is the attempt to do existential justice to individuality, okay?

212
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
That's what it's about.

213
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,160
Plato is actually very concerned about this and his theory of forms is actually about

214
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,200
individuality, but people who don't understand what it's about literally turn it into the

215
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,120
opposite of that.

216
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,960
And they think it's about how everything is common with everything else and that is not

217
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,680
what it's about.

218
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,840
It has to do with how the commonality of everything is real and how through immersion and commonality

219
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,240
you discover the roots of individuality.

220
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,720
That's what the phase is also about, the theory of stages.

221
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,400
So the aesthetic person can't exist unless they're different from the things around them.

222
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,720
But the nature of living with existing things is you have to thinkify them.

223
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,320
You have to regard them as things and treat them as things.

224
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,560
Well, you cannot separate the effects of your actions on yourself from the effects of your

225
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,640
actions on your environment, okay?

226
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,440
Think about that in your own spare time and you can see why it's necessarily true, but

227
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,480
I won't explain it, but it's the case and the aesthetic person does not understand this.

228
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,120
The aesthetic person thinks you can treat people differently than you yourself want to

229
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,240
be treated and they really actually regard this as an unproblematic way of life and they

230
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,760
don't think it's a contradiction.

231
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,600
It existentially is a contradiction.

232
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,560
If you thinkify everyone around you, you thinkify yourself.

233
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,600
In other words, your identity and so far as you perceive it becomes incredibly contingent

234
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,880
or hinged on external comparisons, but we don't know how other people see us exactly.

235
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,480
We only know how they perceive us based on the way we read their social cues, based on

236
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,080
the way we're treated.

237
00:16:53,080 --> 00:17:00,480
And so an aesthetic person becomes deeply anxious and there's an enormous existential feeling

238
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,120
of emptiness or displacement that underlies the aesthetic phase.

239
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,800
And therefore the aesthetic person is looking for distinction.

240
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,720
They want to stand out amongst all of these damn things.

241
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,480
And that's a reasonable human desire, but I'm pointing out Kirchhoff is trying to help

242
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,880
us see that in that phase by itself because it doesn't understand itself.

243
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,480
Because the aesthetic person doesn't ask, what does it mean that I am existing?

244
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,280
And what does it mean for anything that I behold to be existing?

245
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,440
They don't regard the existing reality of the thing in front of them.

246
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:44,480
So now the ethical standpoint is completely different seeming with regard to this point.

247
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,280
In the ethical standpoint, there is this birth of freedom that Judge Wilhelm is talking

248
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,880
about throughout his side of the exchange of letters in either or.

249
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,880
And in the birth of existential freedom, what happens is, and this is very important, what

250
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,520
I'm about to describe is the ethical standpoint's perspective on itself.

251
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Very important.

252
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm not telling you it's Kirchhoff's standpoint, I'm not telling you it's my standpoint as

253
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
an interpreter.

254
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,040
I'm telling you what I'm about to say is the ethical standpoint on itself.

255
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:24,640
The ethical standpoint on itself is that you only are a mature human being when you embrace

256
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,840
the ethical life and you therefore embrace what is universal.

257
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,440
And embracing what's universal means embracing things as real, existing things.

258
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:41,840
And what's very important is, for Kierkegaard, the concept of duty and the concept of existence

259
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,480
are profoundly connected.

260
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,360
And again, existence is not finally a concept, but insofar as we have a word existence and

261
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,840
it refers to a concept, the concept existence is trying to get us to grasp something that

262
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,920
for Kierkegaard has to do very deeply in the ethical phase with reality itself and therefore

263
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,200
with the exercise of freedom.

264
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,200
So just as you don't truly become a self in a new particular sense for Kierkegaard until

265
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:14,640
you enter the ethical phase, so too you don't become a free person until you recognize the

266
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,920
legitimacy of existence as a claim on you.

267
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:26,000
And because you can't separate ultimately how you treat your environment or people that

268
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,360
you think of as not yourself from how you treat yourself, the claim of existing itself

269
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,000
is the fundamental claim that is operative in the ethical and it manifests itself under

270
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:45,640
the form of universality or commonality, which is to say, for example, I ought to treat you

271
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:55,040
as another being with the same respect that I myself feel I ought to be treated with regardless

272
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,560
of whether I'm treated the way I feel I ought to be.

273
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:03,240
We all know when someone's treating us badly and it incenses us, it outrages us, and we

274
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,920
would rightly defend that outrage if someone insults you for no reason, no provocation,

275
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,600
they degrade you, they enslave you, they oppress you, they make you feel what they feel about

276
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,560
you, which is that you have no value, they make you feel that your existence doesn't

277
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
have a right to be.

278
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,160
I mean, I felt that for lots of complicated psychological reasons I felt the sort of what

279
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,640
I would now say is the sense of existential nullification that you have no right to exist.

280
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,360
And so for people who have this sense, which is not exclusive to any one group or class,

281
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,840
that it is distinctive of oppressed groups in a society, because the nature of systemic

282
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,200
oppression is to create this very profound psychological existential feedback cycle where

283
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,400
you make the person you're oppressing feel as if their existence doesn't really matter

284
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,840
and it only matters for the oppressor.

285
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
It's optional, essentially.

286
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,800
I need my servant when I need service.

287
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,360
When I don't need service, I don't need my servants.

288
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,200
So you could treat servants really well as humans, and I'm not saying many people haven't

289
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
done that.

290
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,840
Or you could treat servants like slaves, which is the person only matters to you when you

291
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,800
need them and you treat them like they're their function.

292
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,160
And even if that person is a servant who could quit at any point, you're treating them like

293
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,520
a slave in the sense that you're dehumanizing them, you're thingifying them.

294
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,400
You're turning them into a thing in your environment that's relevant only to your perception of

295
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,040
your own needs, your own value, and you're therefore nullifying the reality that they

296
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:36,520
are existing, even as you are existing, that as you are existing and having occasional

297
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,040
needs for them, so they are independently existing.

298
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,720
And the aesthetic person does not really recognize the independent value of existing.

299
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:53,080
They don't see the value of other people's existing as a claim upon them.

300
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,040
And this is, again, for those of you who are fictitious scholars, that this is very important.

301
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:03,240
This is connected to an idea of a kind of summons that fictive develops deepening Kant,

302
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,520
but that you could argue, depending on how you interpret the fact of reason, and I won't

303
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
get into that.

304
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm going to do a series on Kant, I think, pretty soon, but you could see it as even

305
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,200
in Kant himself.

306
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,160
Paul Franks, for example, has an interesting argument about the fact of reason in his book

307
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,540
All or Nothing, which would be connected if you're interested in that point.

308
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:29,700
And so, for Kierkegaard, becoming ethical is responding to the summons of freedom.

309
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:36,340
And responding to the summons of freedom is accepting a duty to existing reality.

310
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,020
And in particular, it's accepting a duty to freedom.

311
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,180
And the result of doing this is you look boring to the aesthetic person.

312
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,420
And this perception of boringness is very important.

313
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,420
When the aesthetic person sees real existing, they don't recognize it as existing.

314
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,020
They recognize it as not existing.

315
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,460
They think it's boring because there's nothing to see.

316
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,820
There's nothing to see.

317
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:05,420
Maybe you just see a happy couple at a theater, and your eyes look at them, maybe some contempt,

318
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,580
like, ah, the bourgeois.

319
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:15,180
And then you notice they're really fashionable or a very interesting dandy or the person who's

320
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,660
single and in some fantastically distinctive outfit, or whatever.

321
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,860
I'm not saying this is good or bad.

322
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,780
I'm just saying there's a perspective in which things that are existing don't perceive to

323
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,620
be significant.

324
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,140
And things that are only things are everything that you think of as significant.

325
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:37,100
And so the result is when you try to hoard your existing status as if you created it

326
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,700
and impose it upon a world of things, what you find is you turn all of your own existing

327
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:48,020
reality into a type of thing that you don't understand and you don't control.

328
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,340
So this is key to the religious phase.

329
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,460
This is key.

330
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,460
So now we're in a position to begin to understand what the religious phase is.

331
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,740
Kierkegaard will internal to the religious phase, distinguish religiousness A and B.

332
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,340
I will not discuss that because it doesn't make sense until you've transcended the ethical

333
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,660
phase, which even just from an intellectual pedagogical standpoint, we need a lot more

334
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,180
material to even intellectually pretend we could have done that.

335
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,220
So what I'm going to talk about is the transition from the ethical to the religious.

336
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,900
And that's what I have been talking about this whole time because when you don't see

337
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:32,940
something for what it is, there's only two reasons that you don't see something for what

338
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,220
it is.

339
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,580
You don't see it because you can see it.

340
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,540
And therefore the explanation you have to come up with is why given my capacity to accurately

341
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,980
behold this reality, do I not behold it?

342
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,300
Which you recognize if you think about it, you can only do that through reflection on

343
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,060
the past, through retrospection and memory.

344
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,860
You can't know in a moment that you're not seeing something that you're not seeing it,

345
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,260
of course.

346
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,300
So either you don't see something because you can see it, but you're not seeing it.

347
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,540
And there the internal dialectic is what explains the capacity not being used.

348
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,340
So you must explain that to yourself.

349
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:17,220
The other explanation is you don't see something because you can't.

350
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,660
If you can't see something, the explanation you have to come up with is why can't I see

351
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,700
this thing for what it is?

352
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,500
Or again, it'll have to be historical.

353
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,340
It'll have to do with your memory.

354
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,180
Why didn't I see this for what it was?

355
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,460
Answer, I couldn't.

356
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,780
Question, why couldn't I?

357
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:40,300
And there we recognize that this difficulty has to do with our inability to accurately

358
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,780
understand our past.

359
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,460
And this is something the aesthetic person cannot do at all.

360
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,820
A person in the aesthetic phase of life keeps changing their outer situation because they

361
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,780
think it'll change their internal experience.

362
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,700
But they don't recognize the reason they're changing their outer situation is because their

363
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:03,180
internal experience is the source of their need for change.

364
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,220
When I'm not saying the change is bad, but the change is designed to help you realize

365
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,060
there's something inside of you that is an impulse.

366
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,420
And unless you grapple with that impulse, you can't really understand it.

367
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,460
Pardon me.

368
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:22,820
So this difficulty of grappling with your past is what is going to be the key marker

369
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,980
between both the aesthetic and the ethical phase in the birth of the religious phase.

370
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,060
Now, how does this relate to existence?

371
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:34,260
In the existing phase, you could think of this as all of the phases collapse into a

372
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,320
bimodal distinction, either you're existing or you're not existing.

373
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,220
The aesthetic person thinks that to exist, they have to be extraordinary.

374
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,540
And to be extraordinary, they have to overcome their experience of their environment rather

375
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,300
than understand why they experience their environment the way they do.

376
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,780
This always leads to despair.

377
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,740
The aesthetic always leads to despair.

378
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,860
These two, a type of ennui, a type of a form that can become suicidal, and you see this

379
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,380
very powerfully depicted in either or volume one.

380
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:10,860
Now the ethical by contrast is connected with duty, and duty is connected with the idea

381
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,700
of accepting the reality of freedom, and freedom, as I've explained, has to do with accepting

382
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,060
the claim of existing upon you.

383
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,220
So here's Judge Wilhelm talking about the monastery, which incidentally is obviously

384
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,460
very trendy again, which I've been telling some of my friends and students this was going

385
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
to be happening.

386
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,460
There's been a kind of trendiness of religiosity and fashion for well over 15 years, but it's

387
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,020
become much more noticeable since the Met Gala exhibit.

388
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:44,020
And there's always a turn towards religious symbology and a kind of faux religious practice,

389
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:51,620
which you see in the kind of the trad turn amongst very wealthy, bored people who don't

390
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:56,060
want to be associated with the so-called, well, progressive left as they would describe

391
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,500
it, because they're too good for that shit.

392
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,100
But they also don't want to hang out with the normies.

393
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:08,220
And so they construct this sort of vaguely dystopian, utopian world made out of kind

394
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:14,140
of old internet stuff and the libertarianism connected with it, with a kind of just very

395
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:20,780
common form of revanchist right wing Catholic aesthetics, which is always delicious, Evelyn

396
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,400
Wong, all that, because it has to do with our American fantasies about aristocracy and

397
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,260
Oxbridge and the beauty and glories of the Roman Catholic Church.

398
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:34,300
And there's a lot of legitimacy to all of this, but it's a fundamentally aesthetic phenomenon.

399
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,460
And it's a big part of our current cultural term, which is one of the reasons I thought

400
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,140
this is a great time to teach Kierkegaard, because Kierkegaard really explains a lot

401
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,780
of our culture.

402
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,980
So here's Kierkegaard and the persona of Judge Wilhelm.

403
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,220
So from the ethical stage, he's describing the monastic life.

404
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,420
And he says, in the Middle Ages, the matter was approached in another way.

405
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,700
One suddenly discontinued the course of one's life and entered the monastery.

406
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,780
The mistake surely was not that one entered the monastery, but the wrong idea is associated

407
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,900
with this step.

408
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,380
I, for my part, can very well reconcile myself to a person's deciding to do this.

409
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,580
In fact, I can see it as really beautiful.

410
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:17,700
But on the other hand, I must insist that he realized what it means.

411
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,700
In the Middle Ages, it was thought that in choosing the monastery, one chose the extraordinary

412
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,620
and became an extraordinary person oneself.

413
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,460
From the attitude of the monastery, one looked down proudly, almost pittingly, on the ordinary

414
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,020
people, like the normies today.

415
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,100
No wonder that people flocked into the monastery when they could become extraordinary persons

416
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,380
at such a bargain.

417
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,220
This is basically like joining the Roman Catholic Church today as a fad.

418
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:45,660
But the gods do not sell the extraordinary at a ridiculously low price.

419
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,540
If those who withdrew from life had been honest and frank with themselves and others, if they

420
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,580
had loved being a human being above all else, if they had felt with some enthusiasm all

421
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,940
the beauty there is in being human, if their hearts had not been unacquainted with genuine

422
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:06,900
deep human feelings, they perhaps would have also withdrawn into the solitude of the monastery,

423
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:12,140
but they would not have foolishly deluded themselves into thinking that they had become

424
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:21,580
extraordinary persons, except in the sense that they were more imperfect than others.

425
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:26,980
So Judge Wilhelm here gives a very deep analysis of this phenomenon that we see happening today.

426
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,660
And he says, in our day, the market value of the monastic life has fallen.

427
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,260
We seldom see a person break altogether with existence, with the universally human.

428
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,260
However, anyone with a more intimate knowledge of men will occasionally find in a single

429
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,980
individual a heterodoxy that is vividly reminiscent of the monastic theory.

430
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,140
For the sake of order, I shall here and now promptly state my idea of what an extraordinary

431
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,540
person is.

432
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,940
The genuinely extraordinary person is the genuinely ordinary person.

433
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,820
The genuinely extraordinary person is the genuinely ordinary person.

434
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,420
Now by the time you've gotten to this part of the book, if you haven't then it's fine,

435
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,780
but if you really, it's very important, if you're going to read either or don't read

436
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,820
volume one, volume one doesn't make sense and a lot of people don't finish it as a result.

437
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,500
It's not supposed to make sense.

438
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,460
It's beautiful, but it's not a coherent set of collections.

439
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,700
It's a collected set of writings that make sense in the perspective of volume two.

440
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,860
So you know, I would say read some of it, get a feel for it, and then as soon as your board

441
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,900
start reading either or volume two, and I'll explain more of this in my series when I talk

442
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:36,740
about how to actually engage the authorship, and I'll give a very brief, but I hope illuminating

443
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:43,180
a characterization of a few of the crucial, pseudonymous characters to help people who

444
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,660
are then reading through this on their own, events they want to take a seminar with me

445
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,620
or do further work on Kierkegaard, particularly to use it for yourself, for your business,

446
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,260
for your life.

447
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,780
So the desire to be extraordinary is a feature of the aesthetic person.

448
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,940
The ethical perspective on that is that what's really extraordinary is people who live actual

449
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:08,060
ordinary lives, and we talk about this, and there's actually a lot of really good media

450
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,700
content about it, but they're kind of in different parts of the internet.

451
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,000
So if you're in the aesthetic internet, you might not see this content and you might think

452
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,260
it's cheesy, but if you're in the ethical part of the internet, you might see a lot

453
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:22,500
of this very pro-human content that really is about glorifying ordinary people who maybe

454
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,340
don't look extraordinary or don't have apparently extraordinary distinctions.

455
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,940
So this is part of the inner reality.

456
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,100
Now you could say, how does this connect all of this to the religious?

457
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:44,060
Well, this is the connection, and this explains why either or ends the way it does.

458
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,140
Judge Wilhelm lays out a very beautiful case.

459
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,700
Some of it's very problematic in his own time and in our time, for example, and things

460
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,540
he'll say about gender, and one would have to interpret those things carefully to then

461
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,380
make sense of them, both in their historical context in Denmark, in the 19th century, and

462
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,460
then in our context today.

463
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,660
But there's still very important claims, because whatever you think about so-called gender

464
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,620
dichotomies, you have to think of them at least as conceptual realities, not biological,

465
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,260
but they play a role in the history of the construction of philosophy, and therefore

466
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,100
culture, marketing, everything.

467
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,620
So this element of the ethical that's very important is to recognize if you only come

468
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:28,500
into existence through your free acceptance of a duty to love another person who freely

469
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:35,940
accepts you, which is the ethical ideal, then you will submit yourself to conditions in

470
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:46,380
life that will look painful or boring or silly to a person who can't fathom, because you

471
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:52,380
can't fathom it until you've done it, who can't fathom actually making a lifelong commitment.

472
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:00,140
So the reality is the world has to be a world primarily of things, and people have to be

473
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,700
primarily exciting insofar as they can excite us.

474
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,780
We like exciting things.

475
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:11,300
So when you're full on aesthetic, you're basically full on capitalist, and capitalism is not

476
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,620
materialistic.

477
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,420
This is a major mistake, just like Americans are not materialistic.

478
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,940
Germans are materialistic, which I consider very positive, right?

479
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,100
If you go to Germany, if you go to Switzerland, lots of places in Europe, particularly the

480
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:31,500
northern kind of Germanic world, they like nice things, quality, physical things.

481
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,220
It's very nice to live in a culture that's actually materialistic.

482
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,060
I say this a lot to my students, so pardon me if those of you have heard me say this

483
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,340
a lot, but capitalism, which America is much more capitalistic, for example, than Germany,

484
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,900
capitalism is immaterialistic.

485
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:52,140
Capitalism focuses on the value of spiritual, invisible qualities.

486
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:58,420
Capital is an invisible quality, most obviously, but status, for example, which is so important

487
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,380
in America, is invisible.

488
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,020
It has all these visible signs and tokens, but you get those because of their sacramental

489
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,020
power.

490
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:10,740
They signal you're belonging to the Church of Capital, and what people care about in capitalism

491
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:19,580
is the consumption of invisible, ineffable realities, things like the presence of other

492
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:27,100
people who are important, the being-seen-ness quality that comes with being at a club, having

493
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:35,020
table service, drinking a bottle of pretty shit vodka for $1,000 because your family

494
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,820
has a trust fund.

495
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,580
That's a very different mode of inhabiting, and it has nothing to do with materiality.

496
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:50,180
You're not having great caviar and drinking a 1976 bottle of phenomenal wine with Michelin

497
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,700
3-star dinner, that is not capitalism.

498
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,120
That's like, you could say materialism, let me use my wealth really well.

499
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,180
When you use your wealth, for example, primarily to perform the fact of having the wealth,

500
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,380
you're not performing a physical thing.

501
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,980
If you guys have been at clubs like that or seen this kind of bottle service, and not

502
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,540
just that sort of, let's say not as nice establishments, but an establishment where

503
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:18,140
people really are spending $20,000, one of my friends used to be a manager at a really

504
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:24,100
nice club scene in New York, their club brought in over a full million dollars in revenue.

505
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,940
Just some people buying drinks, essentially, no food, just people buying drinks in a pretty

506
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:36,580
small space, and people might spend $30,000 at a table in a place like that, and there's

507
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,740
places you can spend a lot more.

508
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:45,340
So this is not about materiality, it's about existentiality, it's about existentiality.

509
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,640
So when you're surrounded by things, you're so anxious about existing that you have to

510
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,940
prove you're existing all of the time in the world of things.

511
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:01,620
When you accept the glorious burden from the ethical standpoint of becoming ethical, of

512
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:07,700
accepting the duty to recognize what you owe, what you owe, this is how the ethical

513
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,580
things of freedom begins when you recognize what you owe to the demands that are placed

514
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,380
on you by existing.

515
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:19,620
Then you enter into a world of freedom, now here's the problem.

516
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,340
In this world of freedom, what do you do when you've done something wrong?

517
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,220
And you could say, well, what do you mean?

518
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,020
Well, think about it, we all do bad things.

519
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:35,620
And when we do, if we're decent at all, we might eventually feel bad about it.

520
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,780
Now there's a very big issue here, which is the ethical person is dutiful because it's

521
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,380
important to be good.

522
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:47,100
And an ethical person is marked by the fact that they care about being good.

523
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,220
Whereas an aesthetic person might mock literally the word goodness, they might mock goodness,

524
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,220
they might mock beauty as words.

525
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:58,540
There's a whole range of people in our culture who sometimes take over academia and institutions

526
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,740
for a few generations, they always destroy them like vandals do.

527
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,260
And then the institutions fall apart or they get retaken over by people who actually care

528
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,940
about quality.

529
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,060
But these vandalisms of institutions comes from people who generally will attack beauty.

530
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,140
And you know what?

531
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,700
People who attack beauty tend to produce ugliness, which isn't surprising.

532
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,020
I'm not saying it's good or bad, it's just if in the end you don't want to live in ugly

533
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:27,820
buildings with ugly art, ugly clothes, ugly character, ugly violence, then maybe it's

534
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:34,660
not the wisest idea, this is the way the ethical stage thinks, to valorize ugliness.

535
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:39,140
But there's a reason people valorize ugliness because they hate what they perceive as the

536
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,740
people who valorize beauty, because maybe beauty just means I'm smart and rich enough

537
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,980
to live a certain way, to work out and to look really nice.

538
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,980
And that's true.

539
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:54,740
There's a kind of awful form of class oppression that basically flaunts the dignities that

540
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:59,540
come with privilege of having wealth, having leisure, having the ability to go to a gym,

541
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,340
having the ability to work out, have a trainer, having the ability to eat high quality food.

542
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,620
And then you look down on all of those fat Americans.

543
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,220
And I saw this when I came to Yale.

544
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,300
It took me about three weeks to realize something really weird about New Haven in the Yale bubble

545
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,300
part of it.

546
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,100
And I thought, no one is overweight.

547
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,900
I came from middle America.

548
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,620
It's totally normal that half the people you see or more are not like, they don't look

549
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
like models.

550
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,580
Whereas when you come into the upper classes, you notice even a 75 year old man, you know,

551
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,860
he'll look trimmer than, you know, the average 40 year old who makes $60,000 a year because

552
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:39,540
their lifestyles permit beauty in a way that another lifestyle makes that beauty would

553
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,020
be very expensive or require an enormous amount of discipline and maybe even things

554
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,120
that the person doesn't have to take care of themselves in that way.

555
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,740
So we have to be sensitive to the fact that there's valid reasons that there's always

556
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,140
a type of hatred of what's called the good or the beautiful, but we have to recognize

557
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,980
there's always a class dimension to that.

558
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:02,140
And if you don't have the class existential class analysis as a tool, philosophically

559
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,980
and in your social analysis, then it's hard to do justice to these phenomenon.

560
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,100
But from the ethical standpoint, it's just a valorization of ugliness.

561
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,660
And it's a mistake of not recognizing just because there are bad people who flaunt good

562
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,820
things doesn't mean that things aren't good.

563
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,140
Most of the ethical true materialist would say, but the ethical person therefore has

564
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,460
a real crisis about dealing with evil.

565
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,820
They can't deal with evil.

566
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,940
They cannot deal with it.

567
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,100
Evil is bad and they recognize that and by bad they recognize it's undesirable and it's

568
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,040
shameful and it induces guilt.

569
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,460
You don't want to do evil things if you're an ethical person.

570
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:44,540
So what about the fact that you do ethical things?

571
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:51,380
So here now I'll just end on this fact, which is the last part of either or is a transition.

572
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:57,740
So it goes through all three stages, but incipiently volume one, the aesthetic volume two is predominantly

573
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,140
the ethical.

574
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:04,940
But as you read the last part of Judge Wilhelm's last letter, last discourse, if you will,

575
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,660
it converges towards a sermon.

576
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:13,260
And the title of the sermon says the crucial fact I'm not going to analyze the sermon now,

577
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:21,020
the title of the sermon is that in relationship to God, we are always in the wrong.

578
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,060
So if you've read this, this is one of the very puzzling realities.

579
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:31,260
It's published at the end of the book as a kind of ultimatum it says in the titles,

580
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,900
the upbuilding that lies in the thought that in relation to God, we are always in the wrong.

581
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,260
Now this is where the ethical founders and this is where I might lose some of you as

582
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,060
viewers.

583
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,060
I hope not.

584
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,780
I hope I get more of you and you start to share this with your friends if you haven't.

585
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,860
But this is a really big part.

586
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,780
This is where Kierkegaard loses most readers and most readers don't even really get here.

587
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:57,020
Because this is the part that German idealism fails on German idealism fails utterly and

588
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,980
totally to deal with the problem of evil.

589
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,700
My own view of the history of German idealism is that it is fruitfully narrated and this

590
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:09,380
is how I teach it and how I'm going to narrate it and all of my work is fruitfully depicted

591
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,940
not saying other depictions are wrong but this is the way I think it should be depicted,

592
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:19,060
the way I see it as a the most significant failed attempt to confront the reality of

593
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,700
evil and the history of philosophy.

594
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,740
And as a result, an alternative rupturing tradition opens up, of course, in the work

595
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:31,500
of Kant, but particularly the work of Schelling, whose great Freihide Schrift is essential

596
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,900
for all of this and Kierkegaard and the subsequent history of German idealism Schopenhauer, everything

597
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,100
Nietzsche all the way to Heidegger and beyond.

598
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:45,340
So when evil is not internalized in the ethical house, the ethical house becomes perversely

599
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:51,540
the great source of evil in a very complicated sense.

600
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:56,260
So the dilemma that either or ends on is from the ethical standpoints phase in which the

601
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,260
good is valorized in four good reasons.

602
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,540
If you read Judge Willhelm, he makes a lot of sense.

603
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,980
He's a very compelling rational character.

604
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,340
You don't have to agree with him about everything, but he's smart.

605
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
He's wise.

606
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,340
He's delicious.

607
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,340
He's funny.

608
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,180
He has a lot of insight.

609
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,100
But you know, he's basically good.

610
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,580
How do you make sense of that basic goodness with all of the evil in society?

611
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,580
How do you make sense of that basic goodness with misogyny?

612
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:25,380
How do you make sense of that all all these complicated questions that you could throw

613
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,580
at the person who valorizes goodness is what good is the good a person might ask?

614
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,220
What good is the good?

615
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,620
And that's not an easy question actually to answer, and it's a fair question to ask

616
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,620
in a certain sense.

617
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,900
If a person says they're good and they value goodness, but then their goodness seems compatible

618
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,580
with all of the evil in the world, there's some weird question where we know, okay, yeah,

619
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,980
I should still be good, but what if it's pointless?

620
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,340
And why would we think that?

621
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,840
Well, we think that because evil gnaws at us.

622
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,180
It gnaws at us.

623
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,220
And there is a profound connection between existing and evil.

624
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,220
They're not identical.

625
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:08,660
It's a kind of error in certain forms of so-called Gnosticism, but evil and existing are deeply

626
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,140
connected and becoming human means becoming aware of evil.

627
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,460
That's part of what becoming human means.

628
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:22,340
So in the reality then of Kierkegaard's world, in the authorship, the ethical phase breaks

629
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:27,580
down when it comes to this single word and meaning repentance.

630
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,460
And Kierkegaard was an excellent scholar of Greek.

631
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:35,300
He is thinking of the Greek word for repentance, metanoia, which is a very powerful, powerful

632
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,260
word and concept in the history of human reflection.

633
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:44,380
And the loss of this concept, Kierkegaard rightly sees as a destructive reality of the

634
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:51,260
modern world is the complete destruction of the concept of repentance and what it names.

635
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:59,180
So Kierkegaard is trying to link the stage of the religious with the difficulty of assimilating

636
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:05,100
repentance and evil in relationship to an absolute standard.

637
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,260
And that's the dilemma that doesn't exist for the aesthetic person.

638
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,900
That exists only when a person cares about becoming good and is really working on becoming

639
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,100
good.

640
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,380
Only the person who cares about becoming good and is working on becoming good begins to

641
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,540
confront the reality of the problem of evil.

642
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:24,420
And therefore it is the problem of evil that gives rise to in the authorship the generation

643
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,140
of the religious phase.

644
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:34,460
So the religious phase therefore has to do with existing overcoming through freedom,

645
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:41,200
its enslavement to a reality of things that it doesn't understand, and then the greater

646
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,840
dilemma that arises from the perspective of a free human being who acknowledges the claims

647
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:52,020
of existing to then recognize in the face of the claims of the existing, what do I do

648
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:57,580
with the reality of such great evil, particularly moral evil, and what do I do with the reality

649
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,660
of my own past evil?

650
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,580
And you could say, I don't care about my past evil.

651
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,580
That's fine.

652
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,780
Just means you're in what Kierkegaard says, the aesthetic phase, you know, you know, you

653
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,660
don't have to change if you don't want to.

654
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,980
And just saying this is the way Kierkegaard is presenting it.

655
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:18,460
So ultimately what's at stake in the religious phase is the transition to a true existence

656
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,420
that can deal with evil.

657
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:27,380
Only the religious phase deals with evil, the ethical fails.

658
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,820
So with that said, I'm going to end this episode, and I will continue it quite directly in

659
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,580
the subsequent episode, which will be the last of this series, this first part, and

660
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,180
I would really like to thank you for joining me so far.

661
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,660
I hope this was interesting and maybe even inspiring, and I would encourage you to check

662
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,460
out becoming human series one origins.

663
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,780
Because the origin of all of my work is that series.

664
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,940
I started my work with that, my public philosophy work.

665
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,300
You can listen to the first three episodes for free on my podcast, Becoming Human.

666
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,860
And then if you like that, or if you like what I've done, you can buy the whole thing.

667
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,260
And I'd encourage you to do that.

668
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,140
You can use the Becoming Human Code if you want a 10% discount on that.

669
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,540
So thanks so much for joining me.
