0	16360	Hi, welcome to this episode 7 of my series on Seren Kierkegaard, The Poet of Existence.
16360	21280	This is the third and final episode on Kierkegaard's theory of the stages.
21280	25880	I covered the aesthetic in episode 5, the ethical stage in the last episode, episode
25880	26880	6.
26880	33600	Today I will discuss the complexities of the religious phase, and that will lead into
33600	37960	my concluding lecture, and that concluding lecture, when it publishes, will be the launch
37960	43240	date of my audio course sponsor in Kierkegaard, which is part 2 of this course.
43240	48080	And if you've appreciated this free material, I would encourage you to check out my website
48080	53400	and see where it all started with the Becoming Human Origin series, which lays out my general
53400	58160	vision about philosophy, religion, and science, and why we need a philosophical revolution
58160	59760	in our own time.
59760	64060	And much of that vision that I lay out that came after over a decade of my own work in
64060	69480	graduate school was birthed originally in my study of Seren Kierkegaard.
69480	75160	And so as I've mentioned in this series, Kierkegaard is a personally very important person for my
75160	76520	life as a philosopher.
76520	82320	He changed my life, he transformed my life, and he, in a way, damaged my life.
82320	83760	I don't blame him for it.
83760	89080	It's not his fault, but I had a nervous breakdown connected with his work as the occasion.
89080	93020	There's a lot of, I guess, light changing there.
93020	98280	And the reality of Kierkegaard's importance is why I'm bringing this series to the public
98280	103280	and why I wanted to make this introductory part of it free, because Kierkegaard is someone
103280	107160	who's so important that whether you ever read him or not, I hope you've seen that we can
107160	111040	learn a great deal about our own lives and about the history of philosophy, of religion,
111040	112680	and theology.
112680	117560	And so today we're going to take on this huge topic, and this is a very difficult topic,
117560	120040	which is the religious phase.
120040	121600	And how are we going to approach it?
121600	128160	In the last lecture, I gave a fairly tightly structured presentation of the ethical phase
128160	130680	in relationship to fear and trembling.
130680	135120	And what I want to do in this lecture, and particularly because the nature of this episode
135120	142000	as a transition to the series finale, and that series finale is then the origin of the
142000	148160	new second part of the series in the audio course, is I want to explain what we don't
148160	152400	understand about the religious phase and why we don't understand it.
152400	157200	And that's about as good as one can do with the religious phase.
157200	159520	And I'll explain why that is in the course of it.
159520	163600	So in order to do that, to kind of give this seemingly negative, but I hope it's going
163600	168200	to be very positive and illuminating presentation of the religious stage, we have to understand
168200	171520	why we don't really understand it.
171520	174120	And that should begin to make some sense existentially.
174120	180360	So I want to introduce the framework of the significance of what we don't understand in
180360	184760	relationship to the significance of what we can't understand.
184760	190000	And in order to do that, I'm going to start by characterizing what I would just broadly
190000	193520	call existential ontology.
193520	197720	And that's always one of those $10 philosophy words that just comes from two pretty common
197720	204480	Greek words in philosophy, ontos, which is a word that comes from a participial form
204480	208960	of being refers to existing things, being things.
208960	213840	And so the on top, for example, in ancient Greek philosophy are an existing thing or
213840	217080	the existing thing in the neutral case.
217080	222840	And this is a very important word from which we then get ontology, ontology, which is the
222840	228480	discourse or interlogic or rationale of the things that exist.
228480	232680	And there's a technical distinction that sometimes emerges between metaphysics and ontology,
232680	237480	but I would contend this distinction is either very clear in the minds of the one using it
237480	241320	and useful, or it's not clear at all, and it's usually not clear.
241320	243320	And therefore it's very unproductive.
243320	248320	So when I say ontology, I'm not distinguishing it from metaphysics as a field or a category.
248320	254720	I'm rather referring to a specific heightened focus in metaphysical reflection, which is
254720	260840	on things under the aspect of their being things and of their being existing things.
260840	264280	And what we'll see very briefly, I can't explain this because it's not a metaphysics course,
264280	269560	is there's actually a tension between the idea of a thing and the idea of existing.
269560	275360	And so existing things are a very pregnant philosophical category, and they're very important
275360	277000	to Kierkegaard.
277000	281280	And we may think of existential ontology primarily in terms of Heidegger, but even though as
281280	287160	you know, I have some modest expertise in Heidegger's work, I don't think Heidegger's
287160	290680	a really good ontologist in any sense.
290680	296540	And I don't find his ideas about ontology particularly useful as a framework.
296540	301760	So when I talk about existential ontology, my dad started Kierkegaard into the medieval
301760	306880	tradition, and then to my own development of those ideas.
306880	309600	So you could say, Sam, why does this matter?
309600	311120	Well, let me ask you a question.
311120	314200	Are you an existing thing?
314200	317160	This is a very important question.
317160	321520	And the aesthetic phase and the ethical phase have two very different perspectives on this
321520	326000	question and the sort of question that this is.
326000	329280	Now let me explain what may seem very enigmatic.
329280	334280	First of all, there's a type of perspective in human life that you may live through.
334280	339280	You may be inside of currently, you may know people who are inside of it, or you may read
339280	343040	books that depict it or that portray it unintentionally.
343040	347680	In this perspective, the person looking at the world is a person looking at a world full
347680	349440	of things.
349440	354000	And those things are seen in fundamental contrast with themselves.
354000	360720	They view themselves as fundamentally a viewer, an observer, someone looking in upon something
360720	363040	that they are separate from.
363040	369480	Now this is the perspective of a person who generally considers themselves to be particular,
369480	371960	to be existing.
371960	379800	And an existing is a manner or a mode, but it's not a manner or a mode of equality.
379800	380960	So it's very difficult to describe.
380960	382560	This is the metaphysical part.
382560	388200	In other words, if I say you're running, we understand running as this kind of, it could
388200	392320	be a gerund or participle, but we're using the participle sense in English grammar, the
392320	397120	idea of an active, ongoing, verbal process, something's happening.
397120	402760	This ongoing, active process of running is a process, and we can say what quality it's
402760	403760	a process of.
403760	410720	It's a quality of running or the capacity to run when it's actualized.
410720	416080	You could say it's manifest in this state of existence, which is the process of running.
416080	417680	That's actually very important to understand.
417680	420960	This kind of, you can seem very pedantic, but for example, if you read Plato's great
420960	427320	dialogue, the Euthyphro, this type of apparently subtle and meaningless grammatical distinctions
427320	433280	in language are very important for making clear certain distinctions about existence.
433280	437480	So there's a person who looks on the world as full of things, and they feel themselves
437480	441720	to be in contrast to those things real or existing.
441720	448440	And so here's the initial psychological root of the contrast between existence and thingness.
448440	454400	We feel that there's a difference between an existing and a thing.
454400	457160	Now we would say real things are things that exist.
457160	461280	So I have my copy of either or, which I'm going to talk about today in terms of the
461280	464120	ethical stage and the transition to the villages.
464120	466520	But you could say this is a book.
466520	470640	The book is a thing, but Kierkegaard is not a thing.
470640	472680	But we also know Kierkegaard is a thing.
472680	477080	Kierkegaard as a thing is, for example, a kind of fashionable, pretty cool existentialist
477080	480040	philosopher who it's cool to know something about.
480040	481640	I'm very aware of that.
481640	485880	It wasn't why I studied Kierkegaard, but I'm perfectly aware that Kierkegaard, for example,
485880	492400	has a cachet that someone like Gabriel Marcel doesn't have, even if Gabriel Marcel should
492400	495640	be much better known than he is, which he should be.
495640	500040	He's in a way, I think, a very great disciple of Kierkegaard's existential ontology.
500040	505000	But Kierkegaard has cachet, Heidegger has cachet, right?
505000	509640	And Neil Bruner doesn't have cachet, if you're in theology, compared to Karl Barth.
509640	512640	So there's a thing-ness to this quality of things.
512640	515400	So we know there's a difference between people and things.
515400	519880	We know that some people looking out on the world see the world as primarily things, and
519880	523600	we therefore can now accept something very uncomfortable, which there is a real sense
523600	528840	in which what we call persons have aspects about them that we can't easily separate that
528840	533500	are thing-like, like cool people are a thing.
533500	538620	If you're in a club scene, and you're in LA, or you're in New York, or you're in London,
538620	543700	and you're in society, depending on what that means for you, it means you want to be associated
543700	545820	with whatever the thing is.
545820	549300	If you're in New York and you're part of society, and you don't know what was recently written
549300	553220	in the New York Times, or in the New Yorker, or you're not familiar with what's going on
553220	557620	on Broadway, then you might be considered out of it.
557620	559580	What is a person who's out of it?
559580	563180	They're a person who kind of doesn't know what the things are.
563180	570620	What is the thing in a situation is a sense of where there's some gravitation of energy
570620	575260	and objectivity, and we're excited by things.
575260	579140	I can't get into the economic dimension, but you can immediately, I think, begin to understand
579140	583460	that what we call consumer capitalism, you really have to describe in the standpoint
583460	588180	of existential ontology, consumer capitalism is a state of the human being in which it
588180	593060	is fundamentally oriented towards things, but it does not understand what things are.
593060	597340	That's a very simple way of describing consumer capitalism, simple in the sense it's concise,
597340	601940	it's brief to say, but it's profound and difficult to make sense of philosophically.
601940	606740	Sometimes you know what it means, it can seem just no maker, secretive in that sense, but
606740	607740	it's true.
607740	611980	That is what consumer capitalism is, and you need, therefore, a blend of what in contemporary
611980	617060	academia we would say is a social psychological standpoint in philosophy, what we would say
617060	619100	is a metaphysical standpoint.
619100	624140	You'll see that for me, as a student and disciple in some ways of Kierkegaard's insights and
624140	629420	person who's built on them throughout my work and career, existential ontology is where
629420	636860	metaphysics and history, and metaphysics and sociology, and metaphysics and psychology
636860	638820	converge and are inseparable.
638820	644780	You can't do existential ontology without an actual lived ability to experience and express,
644780	648860	crucially, express the lived experience of the human being.
648860	656900	So the seducer sees the person that they seduce as a thing, but the pleasure of the seduction
656900	660420	is in the existence and the existing of the thing.
660420	665940	And there's, therefore, a profound contradiction in seduction between the pleasure that the
665940	669660	seducer gets from seduction and the act of seducing.
669660	675020	The act of seducing as a category requires the reduction of a human being to a category,
675020	677740	and a category becomes a thing.
677740	682340	You can classify, compare, oh, this person was much better than this person.
682340	683940	That's what I call sex.
683940	688940	And in my philosophy of eros, I always tell people I don't believe in sex.
688940	691740	Sex to me is like a religion, and it's one I don't subscribe to.
691740	697180	Not that I don't enjoy eros or intimacy, but I don't, that's not sex.
697180	699180	Sex is the opposite of intimacy.
699180	703860	So I can't get into this here, but this is connected to a development of the seducer.
703860	709100	The seducer is a person who's interested in sex, and sex is connected to power.
709100	713740	And power is connected in the sexual way, specifically with domination.
713740	717900	And domination and sexuality converges towards the whole categories of crimes for which we
717900	720980	know very well the proper words.
720980	724820	And one of the reasons our culture is very conflicted about how to deal with those horrible
724820	729140	crimes is because in reality, they're so pervasive.
729140	735380	And the pervasiveness has to do with the conjunction of sexual appetite and thinghood.
735380	742500	And if you become erotically attracted to things, when you're with people, the part
742500	746060	of you that's attracted to them will always be in a type of contradiction, because part
746060	749980	of you is attracted to the actual unique individual in front of you.
749980	753980	And to the extent that you're not attracted to them, you're having to ignore their literal
753980	754980	uniqueness.
754980	758940	You have to ignore their person, not look in their eyes, not think about how they're
758940	762620	going to feel the next day, not think about how you know you're going to treat them after
762620	764300	you're done with them.
764300	766680	And so there you have to think of them.
766680	770700	And then you maybe focus exclusively, not that it's not natural to be attracted to a
770700	776780	beautiful body, for example, but the seducer focuses exclusively on the qualities of the
776780	781220	person that can be think of, that they can enjoy, that they can contemplate the person's
781220	785460	social relations, maybe they're from a very wealthy family, and the seducer is excited
785460	792140	to have access to this, or to know that they're in the 19th century, highly gendered form
792140	793140	of seduction.
793140	798180	Kierkegaard is depicting that they're deflowering some daughter of a noble family.
798180	803980	That's a very, you could say, wicked from the Kierkegaard's cultural morals standpoint.
803980	808840	But today, that's less the issue in seduction is not a particular gendered thing.
808840	815560	But seduction is this thingification of the erotic and therefore the sexualization, you
815560	818560	could say, of existing ontology.
818560	823600	So the existing thing distinction actually is organic to everything we've been doing
823600	825080	in the stages.
825080	831320	The aesthetic person desires deeply to be unique.
831320	836240	They consciously feel this desire, and they want to be extraordinary.
836240	841680	And I'll read in a bit of time from this very powerful passage, near the end of either
841680	846880	or by Judge Wilhelm about the desire to be extraordinary, because this sets up the religious
846880	847880	phase.
847880	854160	Now, you said, Sam, okay, you're thinking, why does this have anything to do with understanding
854160	855160	the religious?
855160	859000	Well, I said, I'm going to explain why we can't understand the religious and how that's
859000	862640	related to why we don't understand the religious.
862640	867480	And I said to explain the relationship between things we don't understand and things we can't
867480	870840	understand, we need existential ontology.
870840	877080	And so here's the first reality, a person who sees things exclusively as things cannot
877080	880480	ever interpret or understand their existence.
880480	888360	A person who sees things exclusively as things cannot ever understand or interpret their existence.
888360	893160	Now I can't get into here why this is connected to nominalism, which is the most misunderstood,
893160	895600	misrepresented position in the history of philosophy.
895600	898960	It's kind of made up position by enemies of the position.
898960	904720	But what the position called nominalism for those who know this term in history of philosophy
904720	912760	ultimately has to do with is the attempt to do existential justice to individuality, okay?
912760	913760	That's what it's about.
913760	918160	Plato is actually very concerned about this and his theory of forms is actually about
918160	923200	individuality, but people who don't understand what it's about literally turn it into the
923200	925120	opposite of that.
925120	928960	And they think it's about how everything is common with everything else and that is not
928960	930680	what it's about.
930680	936840	It has to do with how the commonality of everything is real and how through immersion and commonality
936840	939240	you discover the roots of individuality.
939240	943720	That's what the phase is also about, the theory of stages.
943720	950400	So the aesthetic person can't exist unless they're different from the things around them.
950400	954720	But the nature of living with existing things is you have to thinkify them.
954720	957320	You have to regard them as things and treat them as things.
957320	962560	Well, you cannot separate the effects of your actions on yourself from the effects of your
962560	965640	actions on your environment, okay?
965640	969440	Think about that in your own spare time and you can see why it's necessarily true, but
969440	974480	I won't explain it, but it's the case and the aesthetic person does not understand this.
974480	981120	The aesthetic person thinks you can treat people differently than you yourself want to
981120	986240	be treated and they really actually regard this as an unproblematic way of life and they
986240	988760	don't think it's a contradiction.
988760	990600	It existentially is a contradiction.
990600	994560	If you thinkify everyone around you, you thinkify yourself.
994560	999600	In other words, your identity and so far as you perceive it becomes incredibly contingent
999600	1006880	or hinged on external comparisons, but we don't know how other people see us exactly.
1006880	1011480	We only know how they perceive us based on the way we read their social cues, based on
1011480	1013080	the way we're treated.
1013080	1020480	And so an aesthetic person becomes deeply anxious and there's an enormous existential feeling
1020480	1026120	of emptiness or displacement that underlies the aesthetic phase.
1026120	1029800	And therefore the aesthetic person is looking for distinction.
1029800	1034720	They want to stand out amongst all of these damn things.
1034720	1038480	And that's a reasonable human desire, but I'm pointing out Kirchhoff is trying to help
1038480	1042880	us see that in that phase by itself because it doesn't understand itself.
1042880	1047480	Because the aesthetic person doesn't ask, what does it mean that I am existing?
1047480	1051280	And what does it mean for anything that I behold to be existing?
1051280	1056440	They don't regard the existing reality of the thing in front of them.
1056440	1064480	So now the ethical standpoint is completely different seeming with regard to this point.
1064480	1071280	In the ethical standpoint, there is this birth of freedom that Judge Wilhelm is talking
1071280	1075880	about throughout his side of the exchange of letters in either or.
1075880	1080880	And in the birth of existential freedom, what happens is, and this is very important, what
1080880	1086520	I'm about to describe is the ethical standpoint's perspective on itself.
1086520	1087520	Very important.
1087520	1091160	I'm not telling you it's Kirchhoff's standpoint, I'm not telling you it's my standpoint as
1091160	1092160	an interpreter.
1092160	1098040	I'm telling you what I'm about to say is the ethical standpoint on itself.
1098040	1104640	The ethical standpoint on itself is that you only are a mature human being when you embrace
1104640	1108840	the ethical life and you therefore embrace what is universal.
1108840	1114440	And embracing what's universal means embracing things as real, existing things.
1114440	1121840	And what's very important is, for Kierkegaard, the concept of duty and the concept of existence
1121840	1123480	are profoundly connected.
1123480	1128360	And again, existence is not finally a concept, but insofar as we have a word existence and
1128360	1132840	it refers to a concept, the concept existence is trying to get us to grasp something that
1132840	1138920	for Kierkegaard has to do very deeply in the ethical phase with reality itself and therefore
1138920	1141200	with the exercise of freedom.
1141200	1146200	So just as you don't truly become a self in a new particular sense for Kierkegaard until
1146200	1154640	you enter the ethical phase, so too you don't become a free person until you recognize the
1154640	1158920	legitimacy of existence as a claim on you.
1158920	1166000	And because you can't separate ultimately how you treat your environment or people that
1166000	1172360	you think of as not yourself from how you treat yourself, the claim of existing itself
1172360	1177000	is the fundamental claim that is operative in the ethical and it manifests itself under
1177000	1185640	the form of universality or commonality, which is to say, for example, I ought to treat you
1185640	1195040	as another being with the same respect that I myself feel I ought to be treated with regardless
1195040	1197560	of whether I'm treated the way I feel I ought to be.
1197560	1203240	We all know when someone's treating us badly and it incenses us, it outrages us, and we
1203240	1209920	would rightly defend that outrage if someone insults you for no reason, no provocation,
1209920	1216600	they degrade you, they enslave you, they oppress you, they make you feel what they feel about
1216600	1220560	you, which is that you have no value, they make you feel that your existence doesn't
1220560	1221560	have a right to be.
1221560	1226160	I mean, I felt that for lots of complicated psychological reasons I felt the sort of what
1226160	1231640	I would now say is the sense of existential nullification that you have no right to exist.
1231640	1236360	And so for people who have this sense, which is not exclusive to any one group or class,
1236360	1241840	that it is distinctive of oppressed groups in a society, because the nature of systemic
1241840	1247200	oppression is to create this very profound psychological existential feedback cycle where
1247200	1251400	you make the person you're oppressing feel as if their existence doesn't really matter
1251400	1253840	and it only matters for the oppressor.
1253840	1254840	It's optional, essentially.
1254840	1256800	I need my servant when I need service.
1256800	1259360	When I don't need service, I don't need my servants.
1259360	1263200	So you could treat servants really well as humans, and I'm not saying many people haven't
1263200	1264200	done that.
1264200	1268840	Or you could treat servants like slaves, which is the person only matters to you when you
1268840	1271800	need them and you treat them like they're their function.
1271800	1275160	And even if that person is a servant who could quit at any point, you're treating them like
1275160	1280520	a slave in the sense that you're dehumanizing them, you're thingifying them.
1280520	1285400	You're turning them into a thing in your environment that's relevant only to your perception of
1285400	1290040	your own needs, your own value, and you're therefore nullifying the reality that they
1290040	1296520	are existing, even as you are existing, that as you are existing and having occasional
1296520	1300040	needs for them, so they are independently existing.
1300040	1305720	And the aesthetic person does not really recognize the independent value of existing.
1305720	1313080	They don't see the value of other people's existing as a claim upon them.
1313080	1317040	And this is, again, for those of you who are fictitious scholars, that this is very important.
1317040	1323240	This is connected to an idea of a kind of summons that fictive develops deepening Kant,
1323240	1327520	but that you could argue, depending on how you interpret the fact of reason, and I won't
1327520	1328520	get into that.
1328520	1333000	I'm going to do a series on Kant, I think, pretty soon, but you could see it as even
1333000	1335200	in Kant himself.
1335200	1339160	Paul Franks, for example, has an interesting argument about the fact of reason in his book
1339160	1343540	All or Nothing, which would be connected if you're interested in that point.
1343540	1349700	And so, for Kierkegaard, becoming ethical is responding to the summons of freedom.
1349700	1356340	And responding to the summons of freedom is accepting a duty to existing reality.
1356340	1360020	And in particular, it's accepting a duty to freedom.
1360020	1364180	And the result of doing this is you look boring to the aesthetic person.
1364180	1367420	And this perception of boringness is very important.
1367420	1371420	When the aesthetic person sees real existing, they don't recognize it as existing.
1371420	1373020	They recognize it as not existing.
1373020	1377460	They think it's boring because there's nothing to see.
1377460	1378820	There's nothing to see.
1378820	1385420	Maybe you just see a happy couple at a theater, and your eyes look at them, maybe some contempt,
1385420	1388580	like, ah, the bourgeois.
1388580	1395180	And then you notice they're really fashionable or a very interesting dandy or the person who's
1395180	1399660	single and in some fantastically distinctive outfit, or whatever.
1399660	1400860	I'm not saying this is good or bad.
1400860	1405780	I'm just saying there's a perspective in which things that are existing don't perceive to
1405780	1407620	be significant.
1407620	1412140	And things that are only things are everything that you think of as significant.
1412140	1417100	And so the result is when you try to hoard your existing status as if you created it
1417100	1421700	and impose it upon a world of things, what you find is you turn all of your own existing
1421700	1428020	reality into a type of thing that you don't understand and you don't control.
1428020	1431340	So this is key to the religious phase.
1431340	1433460	This is key.
1433460	1437460	So now we're in a position to begin to understand what the religious phase is.
1437460	1441740	Kierkegaard will internal to the religious phase, distinguish religiousness A and B.
1441740	1446340	I will not discuss that because it doesn't make sense until you've transcended the ethical
1446340	1450660	phase, which even just from an intellectual pedagogical standpoint, we need a lot more
1450660	1455180	material to even intellectually pretend we could have done that.
1455180	1459220	So what I'm going to talk about is the transition from the ethical to the religious.
1459220	1464900	And that's what I have been talking about this whole time because when you don't see
1464900	1472940	something for what it is, there's only two reasons that you don't see something for what
1472940	1474220	it is.
1474220	1478580	You don't see it because you can see it.
1478580	1483540	And therefore the explanation you have to come up with is why given my capacity to accurately
1483540	1487980	behold this reality, do I not behold it?
1487980	1492300	Which you recognize if you think about it, you can only do that through reflection on
1492300	1496060	the past, through retrospection and memory.
1496060	1498860	You can't know in a moment that you're not seeing something that you're not seeing it,
1498860	1500260	of course.
1500260	1505300	So either you don't see something because you can see it, but you're not seeing it.
1505300	1509540	And there the internal dialectic is what explains the capacity not being used.
1509540	1512340	So you must explain that to yourself.
1512340	1517220	The other explanation is you don't see something because you can't.
1517220	1521660	If you can't see something, the explanation you have to come up with is why can't I see
1521660	1523700	this thing for what it is?
1523700	1525500	Or again, it'll have to be historical.
1525500	1527340	It'll have to do with your memory.
1527340	1530180	Why didn't I see this for what it was?
1530180	1532460	Answer, I couldn't.
1532460	1534780	Question, why couldn't I?
1534780	1540300	And there we recognize that this difficulty has to do with our inability to accurately
1540300	1542780	understand our past.
1542780	1546460	And this is something the aesthetic person cannot do at all.
1546460	1550820	A person in the aesthetic phase of life keeps changing their outer situation because they
1550820	1554780	think it'll change their internal experience.
1554780	1557700	But they don't recognize the reason they're changing their outer situation is because their
1557700	1563180	internal experience is the source of their need for change.
1563180	1566220	When I'm not saying the change is bad, but the change is designed to help you realize
1566220	1569060	there's something inside of you that is an impulse.
1569060	1573420	And unless you grapple with that impulse, you can't really understand it.
1573420	1575460	Pardon me.
1575460	1582820	So this difficulty of grappling with your past is what is going to be the key marker
1582820	1586980	between both the aesthetic and the ethical phase in the birth of the religious phase.
1586980	1590060	Now, how does this relate to existence?
1590060	1594260	In the existing phase, you could think of this as all of the phases collapse into a
1594260	1598320	bimodal distinction, either you're existing or you're not existing.
1598320	1602220	The aesthetic person thinks that to exist, they have to be extraordinary.
1602220	1606540	And to be extraordinary, they have to overcome their experience of their environment rather
1606540	1610300	than understand why they experience their environment the way they do.
1610300	1611780	This always leads to despair.
1611780	1614740	The aesthetic always leads to despair.
1614740	1619860	These two, a type of ennui, a type of a form that can become suicidal, and you see this
1619860	1624380	very powerfully depicted in either or volume one.
1624380	1630860	Now the ethical by contrast is connected with duty, and duty is connected with the idea
1630860	1634700	of accepting the reality of freedom, and freedom, as I've explained, has to do with accepting
1634700	1639060	the claim of existing upon you.
1639060	1643220	So here's Judge Wilhelm talking about the monastery, which incidentally is obviously
1643220	1647460	very trendy again, which I've been telling some of my friends and students this was going
1647460	1648460	to be happening.
1648460	1653460	There's been a kind of trendiness of religiosity and fashion for well over 15 years, but it's
1653460	1657020	become much more noticeable since the Met Gala exhibit.
1657020	1664020	And there's always a turn towards religious symbology and a kind of faux religious practice,
1664020	1671620	which you see in the kind of the trad turn amongst very wealthy, bored people who don't
1671620	1676060	want to be associated with the so-called, well, progressive left as they would describe
1676060	1679500	it, because they're too good for that shit.
1679500	1682100	But they also don't want to hang out with the normies.
1682100	1688220	And so they construct this sort of vaguely dystopian, utopian world made out of kind
1688220	1694140	of old internet stuff and the libertarianism connected with it, with a kind of just very
1694140	1700780	common form of revanchist right wing Catholic aesthetics, which is always delicious, Evelyn
1700780	1705400	Wong, all that, because it has to do with our American fantasies about aristocracy and
1705400	1709260	Oxbridge and the beauty and glories of the Roman Catholic Church.
1709260	1714300	And there's a lot of legitimacy to all of this, but it's a fundamentally aesthetic phenomenon.
1714300	1717460	And it's a big part of our current cultural term, which is one of the reasons I thought
1717460	1722140	this is a great time to teach Kierkegaard, because Kierkegaard really explains a lot
1722140	1723780	of our culture.
1723780	1726980	So here's Kierkegaard and the persona of Judge Wilhelm.
1726980	1732220	So from the ethical stage, he's describing the monastic life.
1732220	1735420	And he says, in the Middle Ages, the matter was approached in another way.
1735420	1739700	One suddenly discontinued the course of one's life and entered the monastery.
1739700	1744780	The mistake surely was not that one entered the monastery, but the wrong idea is associated
1744780	1746900	with this step.
1746900	1751380	I, for my part, can very well reconcile myself to a person's deciding to do this.
1751380	1753580	In fact, I can see it as really beautiful.
1753580	1757700	But on the other hand, I must insist that he realized what it means.
1757700	1761700	In the Middle Ages, it was thought that in choosing the monastery, one chose the extraordinary
1761700	1764620	and became an extraordinary person oneself.
1764620	1768460	From the attitude of the monastery, one looked down proudly, almost pittingly, on the ordinary
1768460	1771020	people, like the normies today.
1771020	1775100	No wonder that people flocked into the monastery when they could become extraordinary persons
1775100	1776380	at such a bargain.
1776380	1780220	This is basically like joining the Roman Catholic Church today as a fad.
1780300	1785660	But the gods do not sell the extraordinary at a ridiculously low price.
1785660	1789540	If those who withdrew from life had been honest and frank with themselves and others, if they
1789540	1794580	had loved being a human being above all else, if they had felt with some enthusiasm all
1794580	1799940	the beauty there is in being human, if their hearts had not been unacquainted with genuine
1799940	1806900	deep human feelings, they perhaps would have also withdrawn into the solitude of the monastery,
1806900	1812140	but they would not have foolishly deluded themselves into thinking that they had become
1812140	1821580	extraordinary persons, except in the sense that they were more imperfect than others.
1821580	1826980	So Judge Wilhelm here gives a very deep analysis of this phenomenon that we see happening today.
1826980	1831660	And he says, in our day, the market value of the monastic life has fallen.
1831660	1836260	We seldom see a person break altogether with existence, with the universally human.
1836580	1840260	However, anyone with a more intimate knowledge of men will occasionally find in a single
1840260	1845980	individual a heterodoxy that is vividly reminiscent of the monastic theory.
1845980	1850140	For the sake of order, I shall here and now promptly state my idea of what an extraordinary
1850140	1851540	person is.
1851540	1855940	The genuinely extraordinary person is the genuinely ordinary person.
1855940	1859820	The genuinely extraordinary person is the genuinely ordinary person.
1859820	1863420	Now by the time you've gotten to this part of the book, if you haven't then it's fine,
1863500	1866780	but if you really, it's very important, if you're going to read either or don't read
1866780	1871820	volume one, volume one doesn't make sense and a lot of people don't finish it as a result.
1871820	1873500	It's not supposed to make sense.
1873500	1876460	It's beautiful, but it's not a coherent set of collections.
1876460	1880700	It's a collected set of writings that make sense in the perspective of volume two.
1880700	1885860	So you know, I would say read some of it, get a feel for it, and then as soon as your board
1885860	1890900	start reading either or volume two, and I'll explain more of this in my series when I talk
1890900	1896740	about how to actually engage the authorship, and I'll give a very brief, but I hope illuminating
1896740	1903180	a characterization of a few of the crucial, pseudonymous characters to help people who
1903180	1906660	are then reading through this on their own, events they want to take a seminar with me
1906660	1911620	or do further work on Kierkegaard, particularly to use it for yourself, for your business,
1911620	1913260	for your life.
1913260	1918780	So the desire to be extraordinary is a feature of the aesthetic person.
1918780	1922940	The ethical perspective on that is that what's really extraordinary is people who live actual
1922940	1928060	ordinary lives, and we talk about this, and there's actually a lot of really good media
1928060	1930700	content about it, but they're kind of in different parts of the internet.
1930700	1934000	So if you're in the aesthetic internet, you might not see this content and you might think
1934000	1937260	it's cheesy, but if you're in the ethical part of the internet, you might see a lot
1937260	1942500	of this very pro-human content that really is about glorifying ordinary people who maybe
1942500	1948340	don't look extraordinary or don't have apparently extraordinary distinctions.
1948340	1951940	So this is part of the inner reality.
1951940	1956100	Now you could say, how does this connect all of this to the religious?
1956100	1964060	Well, this is the connection, and this explains why either or ends the way it does.
1964060	1967140	Judge Wilhelm lays out a very beautiful case.
1967140	1971700	Some of it's very problematic in his own time and in our time, for example, and things
1971700	1976540	he'll say about gender, and one would have to interpret those things carefully to then
1976660	1981380	make sense of them, both in their historical context in Denmark, in the 19th century, and
1981380	1983460	then in our context today.
1983460	1986660	But there's still very important claims, because whatever you think about so-called gender
1986660	1991620	dichotomies, you have to think of them at least as conceptual realities, not biological,
1991620	1995260	but they play a role in the history of the construction of philosophy, and therefore
1995260	1998100	culture, marketing, everything.
1998100	2002620	So this element of the ethical that's very important is to recognize if you only come
2002700	2008500	into existence through your free acceptance of a duty to love another person who freely
2008500	2015940	accepts you, which is the ethical ideal, then you will submit yourself to conditions in
2015940	2026380	life that will look painful or boring or silly to a person who can't fathom, because you
2026380	2032380	can't fathom it until you've done it, who can't fathom actually making a lifelong commitment.
2033500	2040140	So the reality is the world has to be a world primarily of things, and people have to be
2040140	2043700	primarily exciting insofar as they can excite us.
2043700	2045780	We like exciting things.
2045780	2051300	So when you're full on aesthetic, you're basically full on capitalist, and capitalism is not
2051300	2052620	materialistic.
2052620	2056420	This is a major mistake, just like Americans are not materialistic.
2056420	2059940	Germans are materialistic, which I consider very positive, right?
2059940	2064100	If you go to Germany, if you go to Switzerland, lots of places in Europe, particularly the
2064100	2071500	northern kind of Germanic world, they like nice things, quality, physical things.
2071500	2076220	It's very nice to live in a culture that's actually materialistic.
2076220	2079060	I say this a lot to my students, so pardon me if those of you have heard me say this
2079060	2084340	a lot, but capitalism, which America is much more capitalistic, for example, than Germany,
2084340	2086900	capitalism is immaterialistic.
2086900	2092140	Capitalism focuses on the value of spiritual, invisible qualities.
2092140	2098420	Capital is an invisible quality, most obviously, but status, for example, which is so important
2098420	2100380	in America, is invisible.
2100380	2104020	It has all these visible signs and tokens, but you get those because of their sacramental
2104020	2105020	power.
2105020	2110740	They signal you're belonging to the Church of Capital, and what people care about in capitalism
2110740	2119580	is the consumption of invisible, ineffable realities, things like the presence of other
2119580	2127100	people who are important, the being-seen-ness quality that comes with being at a club, having
2127100	2135020	table service, drinking a bottle of pretty shit vodka for $1,000 because your family
2135020	2136820	has a trust fund.
2136820	2140580	That's a very different mode of inhabiting, and it has nothing to do with materiality.
2141420	2150180	You're not having great caviar and drinking a 1976 bottle of phenomenal wine with Michelin
2150180	2153700	3-star dinner, that is not capitalism.
2153700	2157120	That's like, you could say materialism, let me use my wealth really well.
2157120	2161180	When you use your wealth, for example, primarily to perform the fact of having the wealth,
2161180	2163380	you're not performing a physical thing.
2163380	2167980	If you guys have been at clubs like that or seen this kind of bottle service, and not
2167980	2171540	just that sort of, let's say not as nice establishments, but an establishment where
2171540	2178140	people really are spending $20,000, one of my friends used to be a manager at a really
2178140	2184100	nice club scene in New York, their club brought in over a full million dollars in revenue.
2184100	2188940	Just some people buying drinks, essentially, no food, just people buying drinks in a pretty
2188940	2196580	small space, and people might spend $30,000 at a table in a place like that, and there's
2196580	2198740	places you can spend a lot more.
2198740	2205340	So this is not about materiality, it's about existentiality, it's about existentiality.
2205340	2210640	So when you're surrounded by things, you're so anxious about existing that you have to
2210640	2214940	prove you're existing all of the time in the world of things.
2214940	2221620	When you accept the glorious burden from the ethical standpoint of becoming ethical, of
2221620	2227700	accepting the duty to recognize what you owe, what you owe, this is how the ethical
2227700	2231580	things of freedom begins when you recognize what you owe to the demands that are placed
2231580	2233380	on you by existing.
2233380	2239620	Then you enter into a world of freedom, now here's the problem.
2239620	2244340	In this world of freedom, what do you do when you've done something wrong?
2244340	2247220	And you could say, well, what do you mean?
2247220	2250020	Well, think about it, we all do bad things.
2250020	2255620	And when we do, if we're decent at all, we might eventually feel bad about it.
2255620	2259780	Now there's a very big issue here, which is the ethical person is dutiful because it's
2259780	2262380	important to be good.
2262380	2267100	And an ethical person is marked by the fact that they care about being good.
2267100	2271220	Whereas an aesthetic person might mock literally the word goodness, they might mock goodness,
2271220	2273220	they might mock beauty as words.
2273220	2278540	There's a whole range of people in our culture who sometimes take over academia and institutions
2278540	2282740	for a few generations, they always destroy them like vandals do.
2282740	2286260	And then the institutions fall apart or they get retaken over by people who actually care
2286260	2287940	about quality.
2287940	2292060	But these vandalisms of institutions comes from people who generally will attack beauty.
2292060	2293140	And you know what?
2293140	2295700	People who attack beauty tend to produce ugliness, which isn't surprising.
2295700	2299020	I'm not saying it's good or bad, it's just if in the end you don't want to live in ugly
2299020	2307820	buildings with ugly art, ugly clothes, ugly character, ugly violence, then maybe it's
2307820	2314660	not the wisest idea, this is the way the ethical stage thinks, to valorize ugliness.
2314660	2319140	But there's a reason people valorize ugliness because they hate what they perceive as the
2319140	2323740	people who valorize beauty, because maybe beauty just means I'm smart and rich enough
2323740	2326980	to live a certain way, to work out and to look really nice.
2326980	2327980	And that's true.
2327980	2334740	There's a kind of awful form of class oppression that basically flaunts the dignities that
2334740	2339540	come with privilege of having wealth, having leisure, having the ability to go to a gym,
2339540	2343340	having the ability to work out, have a trainer, having the ability to eat high quality food.
2343340	2346620	And then you look down on all of those fat Americans.
2346620	2348220	And I saw this when I came to Yale.
2348220	2352300	It took me about three weeks to realize something really weird about New Haven in the Yale bubble
2352300	2353300	part of it.
2353300	2356100	And I thought, no one is overweight.
2356100	2357900	I came from middle America.
2357900	2362620	It's totally normal that half the people you see or more are not like, they don't look
2362700	2363700	like models.
2363700	2368580	Whereas when you come into the upper classes, you notice even a 75 year old man, you know,
2368580	2373860	he'll look trimmer than, you know, the average 40 year old who makes $60,000 a year because
2373860	2379540	their lifestyles permit beauty in a way that another lifestyle makes that beauty would
2379540	2384020	be very expensive or require an enormous amount of discipline and maybe even things
2384020	2387120	that the person doesn't have to take care of themselves in that way.
2387120	2390740	So we have to be sensitive to the fact that there's valid reasons that there's always
2390820	2395140	a type of hatred of what's called the good or the beautiful, but we have to recognize
2395140	2396980	there's always a class dimension to that.
2396980	2402140	And if you don't have the class existential class analysis as a tool, philosophically
2402140	2406980	and in your social analysis, then it's hard to do justice to these phenomenon.
2406980	2411100	But from the ethical standpoint, it's just a valorization of ugliness.
2411100	2415660	And it's a mistake of not recognizing just because there are bad people who flaunt good
2415660	2417820	things doesn't mean that things aren't good.
2417820	2422140	Most of the ethical true materialist would say, but the ethical person therefore has
2422140	2424460	a real crisis about dealing with evil.
2424460	2426820	They can't deal with evil.
2426820	2428940	They cannot deal with it.
2428940	2433100	Evil is bad and they recognize that and by bad they recognize it's undesirable and it's
2433100	2436040	shameful and it induces guilt.
2436040	2439460	You don't want to do evil things if you're an ethical person.
2439460	2444540	So what about the fact that you do ethical things?
2444540	2451380	So here now I'll just end on this fact, which is the last part of either or is a transition.
2451380	2457740	So it goes through all three stages, but incipiently volume one, the aesthetic volume two is predominantly
2457740	2459140	the ethical.
2459140	2464940	But as you read the last part of Judge Wilhelm's last letter, last discourse, if you will,
2464940	2467660	it converges towards a sermon.
2467660	2473260	And the title of the sermon says the crucial fact I'm not going to analyze the sermon now,
2473260	2481020	the title of the sermon is that in relationship to God, we are always in the wrong.
2481020	2485060	So if you've read this, this is one of the very puzzling realities.
2485060	2491260	It's published at the end of the book as a kind of ultimatum it says in the titles,
2491260	2496900	the upbuilding that lies in the thought that in relation to God, we are always in the wrong.
2496900	2500260	Now this is where the ethical founders and this is where I might lose some of you as
2500260	2502060	viewers.
2502060	2503060	I hope not.
2503060	2505780	I hope I get more of you and you start to share this with your friends if you haven't.
2505780	2507860	But this is a really big part.
2507860	2511780	This is where Kierkegaard loses most readers and most readers don't even really get here.
2511780	2517020	Because this is the part that German idealism fails on German idealism fails utterly and
2517020	2518980	totally to deal with the problem of evil.
2518980	2523700	My own view of the history of German idealism is that it is fruitfully narrated and this
2523700	2529380	is how I teach it and how I'm going to narrate it and all of my work is fruitfully depicted
2529660	2532940	not saying other depictions are wrong but this is the way I think it should be depicted,
2532940	2539060	the way I see it as a the most significant failed attempt to confront the reality of
2539060	2542700	evil and the history of philosophy.
2542700	2546740	And as a result, an alternative rupturing tradition opens up, of course, in the work
2546740	2551500	of Kant, but particularly the work of Schelling, whose great Freihide Schrift is essential
2551500	2555900	for all of this and Kierkegaard and the subsequent history of German idealism Schopenhauer, everything
2555900	2559100	Nietzsche all the way to Heidegger and beyond.
2559180	2565340	So when evil is not internalized in the ethical house, the ethical house becomes perversely
2565340	2571540	the great source of evil in a very complicated sense.
2571540	2576260	So the dilemma that either or ends on is from the ethical standpoints phase in which the
2576260	2580260	good is valorized in four good reasons.
2580260	2582540	If you read Judge Willhelm, he makes a lot of sense.
2582540	2584980	He's a very compelling rational character.
2584980	2587340	You don't have to agree with him about everything, but he's smart.
2587340	2588340	He's wise.
2588340	2589340	He's delicious.
2589340	2590340	He's funny.
2590340	2592180	He has a lot of insight.
2592180	2595100	But you know, he's basically good.
2595100	2599580	How do you make sense of that basic goodness with all of the evil in society?
2599580	2601580	How do you make sense of that basic goodness with misogyny?
2601580	2605380	How do you make sense of that all all these complicated questions that you could throw
2605380	2610580	at the person who valorizes goodness is what good is the good a person might ask?
2610580	2614220	What good is the good?
2614220	2618620	And that's not an easy question actually to answer, and it's a fair question to ask
2618620	2619620	in a certain sense.
2619620	2622900	If a person says they're good and they value goodness, but then their goodness seems compatible
2622900	2627580	with all of the evil in the world, there's some weird question where we know, okay, yeah,
2627580	2631980	I should still be good, but what if it's pointless?
2631980	2633340	And why would we think that?
2633340	2636840	Well, we think that because evil gnaws at us.
2636840	2639180	It gnaws at us.
2639180	2642220	And there is a profound connection between existing and evil.
2642220	2643220	They're not identical.
2643220	2648660	It's a kind of error in certain forms of so-called Gnosticism, but evil and existing are deeply
2648660	2653140	connected and becoming human means becoming aware of evil.
2653140	2655460	That's part of what becoming human means.
2655460	2662340	So in the reality then of Kierkegaard's world, in the authorship, the ethical phase breaks
2662340	2667580	down when it comes to this single word and meaning repentance.
2667580	2670460	And Kierkegaard was an excellent scholar of Greek.
2670460	2675300	He is thinking of the Greek word for repentance, metanoia, which is a very powerful, powerful
2675300	2679260	word and concept in the history of human reflection.
2679260	2684380	And the loss of this concept, Kierkegaard rightly sees as a destructive reality of the
2684380	2691260	modern world is the complete destruction of the concept of repentance and what it names.
2691260	2699180	So Kierkegaard is trying to link the stage of the religious with the difficulty of assimilating
2699180	2705100	repentance and evil in relationship to an absolute standard.
2705100	2708260	And that's the dilemma that doesn't exist for the aesthetic person.
2708260	2711900	That exists only when a person cares about becoming good and is really working on becoming
2711900	2713100	good.
2713100	2716380	Only the person who cares about becoming good and is working on becoming good begins to
2716380	2719540	confront the reality of the problem of evil.
2719540	2724420	And therefore it is the problem of evil that gives rise to in the authorship the generation
2724420	2726140	of the religious phase.
2726140	2734460	So the religious phase therefore has to do with existing overcoming through freedom,
2734460	2741200	its enslavement to a reality of things that it doesn't understand, and then the greater
2741200	2746840	dilemma that arises from the perspective of a free human being who acknowledges the claims
2746840	2752020	of existing to then recognize in the face of the claims of the existing, what do I do
2752020	2757580	with the reality of such great evil, particularly moral evil, and what do I do with the reality
2757580	2759660	of my own past evil?
2759660	2761580	And you could say, I don't care about my past evil.
2761580	2762580	That's fine.
2762580	2765780	Just means you're in what Kierkegaard says, the aesthetic phase, you know, you know, you
2765780	2767660	don't have to change if you don't want to.
2767660	2769980	And just saying this is the way Kierkegaard is presenting it.
2769980	2778460	So ultimately what's at stake in the religious phase is the transition to a true existence
2778460	2782420	that can deal with evil.
2782420	2787380	Only the religious phase deals with evil, the ethical fails.
2787380	2792820	So with that said, I'm going to end this episode, and I will continue it quite directly in
2792820	2797580	the subsequent episode, which will be the last of this series, this first part, and
2797580	2801180	I would really like to thank you for joining me so far.
2801180	2804660	I hope this was interesting and maybe even inspiring, and I would encourage you to check
2804660	2807460	out becoming human series one origins.
2807460	2810780	Because the origin of all of my work is that series.
2810780	2813940	I started my work with that, my public philosophy work.
2813940	2818300	You can listen to the first three episodes for free on my podcast, Becoming Human.
2818300	2821860	And then if you like that, or if you like what I've done, you can buy the whole thing.
2821860	2823260	And I'd encourage you to do that.
2823260	2827140	You can use the Becoming Human Code if you want a 10% discount on that.
2827140	2828540	So thanks so much for joining me.
2828540	2829740	I'm Samuel Lankar.
2829740	2833860	I'm the founder of the Becoming Human Project, and this was episode seven of Kierkegaard,
2833860	2835060	The Poet of Existence.
