 In this episode, we delve into the concept of "the religious phase" in Søren Kierkegaard's stages of existence as outlined in his works, particularly in "The Ethical and the Ethical in the Ethical." Kierkegaard presents a deep reflection on the nature of goodness, evil, and repentance. The ethical phase, which is characterized by an individual striving to live according to universal moral laws, ultimately faces a crisis when confronted with the reality of evil and personal moral failings.

Kierkegaard emphasizes the Greek term metanoia, or repentance, as central to understanding the religious phase. This phase is marked by an individual's struggle to reconcile with the absolute standard of good and evil, which becomes acutely problematic when one acknowledges their own past wrongdoings and the prevalence of evil in the world.

The religious phase is a transition to a true existence that can authentically confront and deal with the reality of moral evil. It is only within this phase that one grapples with the existential dilemma posed by the problem of evil. Kierkegaard's work invites us to reflect on our own values, actions, and the nature of repentance as we navigate the complexities of human existence.
