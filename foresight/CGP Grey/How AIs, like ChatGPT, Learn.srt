1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
On the internet, the algorithms are all around you.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,000
You are watching this video because an algorithm brought it to you,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
among others, to click, which you did, and the algorithm took note.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,520
When you open the Tweet Book, A, the algorithm decides what you see.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,960
When you search through your photos, A, the algorithm does the finding.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,880
Maybe even makes a little movie for you.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,760
When you buy something, A, the algorithm sets the price,

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
and A, the algorithm is at your bank watching transactions for fraud.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,680
The stock market is full of algorithms trading with algorithms.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,320
Given this, you might want to know how these little algorithmic bots shaping your world work,

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,080
especially when they don't.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,800
In ye olden days, humans built algorithmic bots

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
by giving them instructions the humans could explain.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,760
If this, then that.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,120
But many problems are just too big and hard for a human to write simple instructions for.

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,920
There's a gazillion financial transactions a second.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,600
Which ones are fraudulent?

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
There's octillion videos on NetMeTube,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,960
which eight should the user see as recommendations,

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,600
which shouldn't be allowed on the site at all.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,080
For this airline seat, what is the maximum price this user will pay right now?

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,480
Algorithmic bots give answers to these questions,

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,840
not perfect answers, but much better than a human could do.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,760
But how these bots work exactly more and more no one knows,

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,760
not even the humans who built them, or built them, as we will see.

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,360
Now, companies that use these bots don't want to talk about how they work,

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
because the bots are valuable employees.

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,200
Very, very valuable.

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,720
And how their brains are built is a fiercely guarded trade secret.

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,560
Right now, the cutting edge is most likely very, I hope you like linear algebra,

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,360
but what the current hotness is on any particular site,

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,200
and how the bots work is a bit, I don't know, and a ways will be.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,800
So let's talk about one of the more quaint,

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,320
but understandable ways bots can be built without understanding how their brains work.

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,200
Say you want a bot that can recognize what is in a picture.

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
Is it a B or is it a 3?

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,680
It's easy for humans, even little humans,

38
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,840
but it's impossible to just tell a bot in bot language how to do it,

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
because really we just know that's a B and that's a 3.

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,200
We can say in words what makes them different, but bots don't understand words,

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,040
and it's the wiring in our brains that makes it happen anyway.

42
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,760
While an individual neuron may be understood,

43
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,800
and clusters of neurons general purpose vaguely grasped,

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,480
the whole is beyond.

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,000
Nonetheless, it works.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,440
So to get a bot that can do this sorting, you don't build it yourself.

47
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,200
You build a bot that builds bots and a bot that teaches bots.

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,600
These bots' brains are simpler, something a smart human programmer can make.

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,120
The builder bot builds bots, though it's not very good at it.

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,440
At first it connects the wires and modules in the bot brains almost at random.

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,480
This leads to some very special student bots sent to teacher bot to teach.

52
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,680
Of course, teacher bot can't tell a B from a 3 either.

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,200
If the human could build teacher bot to do that, well then problem solved.

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Instead, the human gives teacher bot a bunch of B photos and 3 photos,

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,040
and an answer key to which is what.

56
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,800
Teacher bot can't teach, but teacher bot can test.

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,920
The adorable student bots stick out their tongues, try very hard,

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,840
but they are bad at what they do.

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,200
Very, very bad.

60
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,960
And it's not their fault really.

61
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,080
They were built that way.

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,600
Grades in hand, the student bots take a march of shame back to builder bot.

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,280
Those that did best are put to one side, the others recycled.

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,760
Builder bot still isn't good at building bots,

65
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,760
but now it takes those left and makes copies with changes and new combinations.

66
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,440
Back to school they go.

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,040
Teacher bot teaches, or tests again, and builder bot builds again.

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,880
And again, and again.

69
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,240
Now, a builder that builds at random and a teacher that doesn't teach just tests,

70
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,640
and students who can't learn, they just are what they are,

71
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,680
in theory shouldn't work, but in practice it does.

72
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,960
Partly because in every iteration, builder bot slaughterhouse keeps the best and discards the rest,

73
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,440
and partly because teacher bot isn't overseeing an old-timey one-room schoolhouse

74
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,400
with a dozen students, but an infinite warehouse with thousands of students.

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
The test isn't 10 questions, but a million questions.

76
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,600
And how many times does the test build test loop repeat?

77
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,920
As many as necessary.

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,560
At first, students that survive are just lucky,

79
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,400
but by combining enough lucky bots and keeping only what works,

80
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
and randomly messing around with new copies of that,

81
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,480
eventually a student bot emerges that isn't lucky,

82
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,520
that can perhaps barely tell bees from threes.

83
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,280
As this bot is copied and changed, slowly the average test score rises,

84
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,600
and thus the grade needed to survive the next round gets higher and higher.

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,040
Keep this up, and eventually from the infinite warehouse slaughterhouse,

86
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,560
a student bot will emerge who can tell a bee from a tree in a photo

87
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
it's never seen before pretty well.

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,760
But how the student bot does this, neither the teacher bot,

89
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,040
nor the builder bot, nor the human overseer can understand.

90
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,440
Nor the student bot itself.

91
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,400
After keeping so many useful random changes,

92
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,360
the wiring in its head is incredibly complicated,

93
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,400
and while an individual line of code may be understood

94
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
and clusters of codes general purpose vaguely grasped,

95
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,960
the whole is beyond.

96
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,640
Nonetheless, it works.

97
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,280
But this is frustrating, especially as the student bot

98
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,000
is very good at exactly only the kinds of questions it's been taught to.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,640
It's great with photos, but useless with videos,

100
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,440
or baffled if the photos are upside down,

101
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,120
or things that are obviously not bees, it's confident are.

102
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,560
Since teacher bot can't teach,

103
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,440
all the human overseer can do is give it more questions

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,120
to make the test even longer,

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,640
to include the kinds of questions the best bots get wrong.

106
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,560
This is important to understand.

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,560
It's a reason why companies are obsessed with collecting data.

108
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,840
More data equals longer tests equals better bots.

109
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
So when you get the are you human test on a website,

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,280
you are not only proving that you are human, hopefully,

111
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,720
but you are also helping to build the test to make bots that can read,

112
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,680
or count, or tell lakes from mountains or horses from humans.

113
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,080
Seeing lots of questions about driving lately,

114
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,880
hmm, what could that be building a test for?

115
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,280
Now figuring out what's in a photo, or on a sign,

116
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,200
or filtering videos requires humans to make correct enough tests,

117
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,400
but there is another kind of test that makes itself.

118
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,560
Tests on the humans.

119
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
For example, say entirely hypothetical NetMeTube

120
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,120
wanted users to keep watching as long as possible.

121
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,480
Well, how long a user stays on the site is easy to measure,

122
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,480
so teacher bot gives each student bot a bunch of NetMeTube users to oversee,

123
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,560
the student bots watch what their user watches,

124
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,520
looks at their files,

125
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,720
and do their best to pick the videos that keep the user on the site,

126
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,280
the longer the average, the higher their test score.

127
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,200
Build, test, repeat.

128
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,320
A million cycles later,

129
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,080
there's a student bot who's pretty good at keeping the users watching,

130
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,560
at least compared to what a human could build.

131
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
But when people ask how does the NetMeTube algorithm select videos,

132
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
once again, there isn't a great answer,

133
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
other than pointing to the bot and the user data it had access to,

134
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,680
and most vitally, how the human overseers direct teacher bot to score the test.

135
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,800
That's what the bot is trying to be good at to survive,

136
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,440
but what the bot is thinking, or how it thinks it, is not really knowable.

137
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,040
All that's knowable is this student bot gets to be the algorithm

138
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,120
because it's 0.1% better than the previous bot at the test the human's design.

139
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,520
So everywhere on the internet, behind the scenes,

140
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,760
there are tests to increase user interaction,

141
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,200
or set prices just right to maximize revenue,

142
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,600
or pick the posts from all your friends you'll like the most,

143
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,080
or articles people will share the most, or whatever.

144
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,760
If it's testable, it's teachable.

145
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,800
Well, teachable.

146
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,200
And a student bot will graduate from the warehouse

147
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,520
to be the algorithm of its domain, at least for a little while.

148
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,680
We're used to the idea that the tools we use,

149
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,320
even if we don't understand them, someone does.

150
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,160
But with our machines that learn,

151
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,400
we are increasingly in a position where we use tools or are used by tools

152
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,680
that no one, not even their creators, understand.

153
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,200
We can only hope to guide them with the tests we make.

154
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,960
And we need to get comfortable with that,

155
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,760
as our algorithmic bot buddies are all around and not going anywhere.

156
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Okay, the bots are watching.

157
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,600
You know what's coming.

158
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,400
This is where I need to ask you to like, comment, and subscribe,

159
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,720
and bell me, and share on the tweet book.

160
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,960
The algorithm is watching.

161
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,120
It won't show people the video unless you do this.

162
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,640
Look what you've reduced me to bots.

163
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,040
What do you want?

164
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,320
Do you want watch time?

165
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,200
Is that what you want?

166
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,480
Fine.

167
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,400
Hey guys, did you know I also have podcasts you can listen to?

168
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,480
Maybe even just in the background,

169
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,640
while you're tidying up your all room for hours or whatever.

170
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,520
