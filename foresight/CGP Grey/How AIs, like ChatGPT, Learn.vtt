00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
On the internet, the algorithms are all around you.

00:02.960 --> 00:06.000
You are watching this video because an algorithm brought it to you,

00:06.000 --> 00:10.080
among others, to click, which you did, and the algorithm took note.

00:10.080 --> 00:13.520
When you open the Tweet Book, A, the algorithm decides what you see.

00:13.520 --> 00:16.960
When you search through your photos, A, the algorithm does the finding.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.880
Maybe even makes a little movie for you.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.760
When you buy something, A, the algorithm sets the price,

00:21.760 --> 00:26.000
and A, the algorithm is at your bank watching transactions for fraud.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.680
The stock market is full of algorithms trading with algorithms.

00:29.680 --> 00:34.320
Given this, you might want to know how these little algorithmic bots shaping your world work,

00:34.320 --> 00:36.080
especially when they don't.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.800
In ye olden days, humans built algorithmic bots

00:38.800 --> 00:42.000
by giving them instructions the humans could explain.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.760
If this, then that.

00:43.760 --> 00:49.120
But many problems are just too big and hard for a human to write simple instructions for.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.920
There's a gazillion financial transactions a second.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.600
Which ones are fraudulent?

00:53.600 --> 00:56.000
There's octillion videos on NetMeTube,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.960
which eight should the user see as recommendations,

00:58.960 --> 01:01.600
which shouldn't be allowed on the site at all.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.080
For this airline seat, what is the maximum price this user will pay right now?

01:06.080 --> 01:08.480
Algorithmic bots give answers to these questions,

01:08.480 --> 01:11.840
not perfect answers, but much better than a human could do.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.760
But how these bots work exactly more and more no one knows,

01:15.760 --> 01:19.760
not even the humans who built them, or built them, as we will see.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.360
Now, companies that use these bots don't want to talk about how they work,

01:23.360 --> 01:25.840
because the bots are valuable employees.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.200
Very, very valuable.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.720
And how their brains are built is a fiercely guarded trade secret.

01:30.720 --> 01:34.560
Right now, the cutting edge is most likely very, I hope you like linear algebra,

01:34.560 --> 01:37.360
but what the current hotness is on any particular site,

01:37.360 --> 01:41.200
and how the bots work is a bit, I don't know, and a ways will be.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.800
So let's talk about one of the more quaint,

01:42.800 --> 01:48.320
but understandable ways bots can be built without understanding how their brains work.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.200
Say you want a bot that can recognize what is in a picture.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.360
Is it a B or is it a 3?

01:53.360 --> 01:55.680
It's easy for humans, even little humans,

01:55.760 --> 01:59.840
but it's impossible to just tell a bot in bot language how to do it,

01:59.840 --> 02:03.600
because really we just know that's a B and that's a 3.

02:03.600 --> 02:07.200
We can say in words what makes them different, but bots don't understand words,

02:07.200 --> 02:11.040
and it's the wiring in our brains that makes it happen anyway.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.760
While an individual neuron may be understood,

02:13.760 --> 02:16.800
and clusters of neurons general purpose vaguely grasped,

02:16.800 --> 02:18.480
the whole is beyond.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.000
Nonetheless, it works.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.440
So to get a bot that can do this sorting, you don't build it yourself.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.200
You build a bot that builds bots and a bot that teaches bots.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.600
These bots' brains are simpler, something a smart human programmer can make.

02:31.600 --> 02:35.120
The builder bot builds bots, though it's not very good at it.

02:35.120 --> 02:39.440
At first it connects the wires and modules in the bot brains almost at random.

02:39.440 --> 02:44.480
This leads to some very special student bots sent to teacher bot to teach.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.680
Of course, teacher bot can't tell a B from a 3 either.

02:47.680 --> 02:51.200
If the human could build teacher bot to do that, well then problem solved.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.800
Instead, the human gives teacher bot a bunch of B photos and 3 photos,

02:54.800 --> 02:57.040
and an answer key to which is what.

02:57.040 --> 03:00.800
Teacher bot can't teach, but teacher bot can test.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.920
The adorable student bots stick out their tongues, try very hard,

03:03.920 --> 03:05.840
but they are bad at what they do.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.200
Very, very bad.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.960
And it's not their fault really.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.080
They were built that way.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.600
Grades in hand, the student bots take a march of shame back to builder bot.

03:13.600 --> 03:17.280
Those that did best are put to one side, the others recycled.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.760
Builder bot still isn't good at building bots,

03:19.760 --> 03:23.760
but now it takes those left and makes copies with changes and new combinations.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.440
Back to school they go.

03:25.440 --> 03:29.040
Teacher bot teaches, or tests again, and builder bot builds again.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.880
And again, and again.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.240
Now, a builder that builds at random and a teacher that doesn't teach just tests,

03:34.240 --> 03:36.640
and students who can't learn, they just are what they are,

03:36.640 --> 03:39.680
in theory shouldn't work, but in practice it does.

03:39.680 --> 03:44.960
Partly because in every iteration, builder bot slaughterhouse keeps the best and discards the rest,

03:44.960 --> 03:49.440
and partly because teacher bot isn't overseeing an old-timey one-room schoolhouse

03:49.440 --> 03:54.400
with a dozen students, but an infinite warehouse with thousands of students.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.760
The test isn't 10 questions, but a million questions.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.600
And how many times does the test build test loop repeat?

04:01.600 --> 04:03.920
As many as necessary.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.560
At first, students that survive are just lucky,

04:06.560 --> 04:10.400
but by combining enough lucky bots and keeping only what works,

04:10.400 --> 04:13.200
and randomly messing around with new copies of that,

04:13.200 --> 04:16.480
eventually a student bot emerges that isn't lucky,

04:16.480 --> 04:19.520
that can perhaps barely tell bees from threes.

04:19.520 --> 04:23.280
As this bot is copied and changed, slowly the average test score rises,

04:23.280 --> 04:27.600
and thus the grade needed to survive the next round gets higher and higher.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.040
Keep this up, and eventually from the infinite warehouse slaughterhouse,

04:31.040 --> 04:34.560
a student bot will emerge who can tell a bee from a tree in a photo

04:34.560 --> 04:36.720
it's never seen before pretty well.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.760
But how the student bot does this, neither the teacher bot,

04:39.760 --> 04:43.040
nor the builder bot, nor the human overseer can understand.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.440
Nor the student bot itself.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.400
After keeping so many useful random changes,

04:48.400 --> 04:51.360
the wiring in its head is incredibly complicated,

04:51.360 --> 04:54.400
and while an individual line of code may be understood

04:54.400 --> 04:57.120
and clusters of codes general purpose vaguely grasped,

04:57.120 --> 04:58.960
the whole is beyond.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.640
Nonetheless, it works.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.280
But this is frustrating, especially as the student bot

05:03.280 --> 05:08.000
is very good at exactly only the kinds of questions it's been taught to.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.640
It's great with photos, but useless with videos,

05:10.640 --> 05:13.440
or baffled if the photos are upside down,

05:13.440 --> 05:17.120
or things that are obviously not bees, it's confident are.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.560
Since teacher bot can't teach,

05:18.560 --> 05:21.440
all the human overseer can do is give it more questions

05:21.440 --> 05:23.120
to make the test even longer,

05:23.120 --> 05:26.640
to include the kinds of questions the best bots get wrong.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.560
This is important to understand.

05:28.560 --> 05:32.560
It's a reason why companies are obsessed with collecting data.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.840
More data equals longer tests equals better bots.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.800
So when you get the are you human test on a website,

05:38.800 --> 05:41.280
you are not only proving that you are human, hopefully,

05:41.280 --> 05:44.720
but you are also helping to build the test to make bots that can read,

05:44.720 --> 05:47.680
or count, or tell lakes from mountains or horses from humans.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.080
Seeing lots of questions about driving lately,

05:50.080 --> 05:52.880
hmm, what could that be building a test for?

05:52.880 --> 05:55.280
Now figuring out what's in a photo, or on a sign,

05:55.280 --> 05:59.200
or filtering videos requires humans to make correct enough tests,

05:59.200 --> 06:02.400
but there is another kind of test that makes itself.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.560
Tests on the humans.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.080
For example, say entirely hypothetical NetMeTube

06:08.080 --> 06:11.120
wanted users to keep watching as long as possible.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.480
Well, how long a user stays on the site is easy to measure,

06:14.480 --> 06:18.480
so teacher bot gives each student bot a bunch of NetMeTube users to oversee,

06:18.480 --> 06:20.560
the student bots watch what their user watches,

06:20.560 --> 06:21.520
looks at their files,

06:21.520 --> 06:24.720
and do their best to pick the videos that keep the user on the site,

06:24.720 --> 06:27.280
the longer the average, the higher their test score.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.200
Build, test, repeat.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.320
A million cycles later,

06:30.320 --> 06:34.080
there's a student bot who's pretty good at keeping the users watching,

06:34.080 --> 06:36.560
at least compared to what a human could build.

06:36.560 --> 06:40.160
But when people ask how does the NetMeTube algorithm select videos,

06:40.160 --> 06:42.160
once again, there isn't a great answer,

06:42.160 --> 06:46.160
other than pointing to the bot and the user data it had access to,

06:46.160 --> 06:51.680
and most vitally, how the human overseers direct teacher bot to score the test.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.800
That's what the bot is trying to be good at to survive,

06:54.800 --> 06:59.440
but what the bot is thinking, or how it thinks it, is not really knowable.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.040
All that's knowable is this student bot gets to be the algorithm

07:03.040 --> 07:09.120
because it's 0.1% better than the previous bot at the test the human's design.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.520
So everywhere on the internet, behind the scenes,

07:11.520 --> 07:13.760
there are tests to increase user interaction,

07:13.760 --> 07:17.200
or set prices just right to maximize revenue,

07:17.200 --> 07:19.600
or pick the posts from all your friends you'll like the most,

07:19.600 --> 07:22.080
or articles people will share the most, or whatever.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.760
If it's testable, it's teachable.

07:23.760 --> 07:24.800
Well, teachable.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.200
And a student bot will graduate from the warehouse

07:27.200 --> 07:31.520
to be the algorithm of its domain, at least for a little while.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.680
We're used to the idea that the tools we use,

07:33.680 --> 07:36.320
even if we don't understand them, someone does.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.160
But with our machines that learn,

07:38.160 --> 07:42.400
we are increasingly in a position where we use tools or are used by tools

07:42.400 --> 07:45.680
that no one, not even their creators, understand.

07:45.680 --> 07:49.200
We can only hope to guide them with the tests we make.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.960
And we need to get comfortable with that,

07:50.960 --> 07:55.760
as our algorithmic bot buddies are all around and not going anywhere.

07:55.920 --> 07:59.920
Okay, the bots are watching.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.600
You know what's coming.

08:02.240 --> 08:08.400
This is where I need to ask you to like, comment, and subscribe,

08:09.440 --> 08:12.720
and bell me, and share on the tweet book.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.960
The algorithm is watching.

08:15.840 --> 08:19.120
It won't show people the video unless you do this.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.640
Look what you've reduced me to bots.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.040
What do you want?

08:25.040 --> 08:26.320
Do you want watch time?

08:26.320 --> 08:27.200
Is that what you want?

08:28.080 --> 08:28.480
Fine.

08:30.480 --> 08:34.400
Hey guys, did you know I also have podcasts you can listen to?

08:34.400 --> 08:36.480
Maybe even just in the background,

08:36.480 --> 08:40.640
while you're tidying up your all room for hours or whatever.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.520
There's hours of audio entertainment for you

08:43.520 --> 08:47.040
and watch time for the bots overseeing your actions.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.800
Go ahead and take a click.

08:48.800 --> 08:53.040
Entertain yourself, help me, help the bots.
