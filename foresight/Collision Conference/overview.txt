============================
Checking Collision Conference/In conversation with the Godfather of AI.txt
1. **Research and Understand the Risks**: Before AI becomes superintelligent, it's crucial to conduct empirical research into how AI might go wrong or attempt to gain control. This understanding is currently lacking compared to the resources dedicated to improving AI capabilities.

2. **Balanced Investment in Development and Safety**: Encourage companies and governments to invest significantly in both improving AI and in understanding its potential risks, aiming for a more balanced investment similar to the current ratio of 99 smart people working on making AI better to one working on how to prevent it from going wrong.

3. **Participate in the Conversation**: Smart individuals should engage in the conversation about AI safety and ethics, ensuring that their perspectives contribute to a more diverse set of voices and concerns in the field.

4. **Tackle Other Risks**: Recognize that AI presents various risks beyond potential existential threats, such as deepfakes and misinformation (commonly known as "fake news"). Governments should consider measures to mark AI-generated content as such, similar to their approach with counterfeit money.

5. **Promote AI for Good**: Continue to develop AI for its numerous positive applications in areas like medicine and climate change, while remaining vigilant about the potential negative consequences.

6. **Engage with the Community**: For the audience, Hinton suggests engaging with the community of AI developers, researchers, and ethicists to contribute to a broader discussion on how to ensure AI remains a force for good in the next generation.

7. **Mitigate Side Effects and Existential Threats**: Worry about and work towards mitigating all the potential bad side effects of AI and the existential threats it might pose, while acknowledging that AI has the potential to be very beneficial.

In summary, Hinton advocates for a balanced approach to AI development, emphasizing the importance of understanding its risks and ensuring it's used for the benefit of humanity. He also highlights the need to address other AI-related issues like misinformation and encourages ongoing dialogue and collaboration among those involved in shaping the future of AI.
