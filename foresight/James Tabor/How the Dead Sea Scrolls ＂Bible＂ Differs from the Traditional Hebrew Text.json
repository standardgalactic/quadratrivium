{"text": " to get started here. Hope everybody can see and hear okay. So today I'm going to talk to you about the Dead Sea Scrolls Bible and I'm using Bible and scare quotes because obviously nobody was carrying around the Dead Sea, you know, a printed Bible or even a handwritten Bible. But the books that are part of the Hebrew Bible, they are represented in the Dead Sea Scroll Library to some extent and that's what I want to talk about. Just as I start I want to introduce you to some resources because I'm teaching a course this semester on the Dead Sea Scrolls so I have everything right here and I know many of you are very interested. I would say the number one book that I would recommend, I got to figure out how to show this at the right angle without the glare, but it's Vander Cam and Flint. I think you all can see that. The meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls, you can get it in paperback. Highly recommended. This is the book on the scrolls. You really need it to be able to talk much about the scrolls or all of their background and to know the history and what they contain and who wrote them and how to date them and all the theories, all the interpretations. That book is a book that I always use and with all of my students. And as far as reading the scrolls, which is also important, I always tell the story in the 90s when I was lecturing here in Charlotte, North Carolina. When the scrolls were on exhibit here in Charlotte and there was this huge exhibit and we had a lecture at the Jewish Community Center. It was standing room only. It was unbelievable. They had to get chairs and open up the side. Everybody's interested in the scrolls and they had just been released through Robert Eisenman's efforts and Herschel Shanks at Bar Magazine and others. I was somewhat involved in that. And after my lecture, a woman came up and she said, oh Dr. Tabor, I'm so glad we have the scrolls finally because about probably a third of the scrolls had not been released until the 90s. So there was a big campaign. Some of you will remember Herschel Shanks really spearheaded it in Bar Magazine, but Robert Eisenman I think was really behind the scenes. And he's the one who actually got the photographs and then had them published. And then they were all public finally. So this is the complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English. It's a penguin paperback. The editor is Geza Vermish, V-E-R-M-E-S. I guess his name is not even on the front, but it's on the side I think. Not even the side. So he didn't write them. He doesn't want his name on, but he's the translator and it's a great addition. It has over a hundred pages of introductory material and then it also has lots of commentary and helps as you read the scrolls. But the main thing is it has the scrolls in English. So I really want to recommend this. So this woman was saying, oh I love the scrolls and I had a version of an earlier version of this and I said, oh have you read them yet? And she goes, oh no I haven't read them, but I just love that we have them. So I think a lot of people are in that situation where we talk about, oh finally we got the scrolls, but then you don't even read them. Maybe kind of like the Bible with people who love that we have the Bible, but they've never read it. Then I want to mention this is the year of the scrolls because here's a life magazine, the Dead Sea Scrolls, after 75 years. The race to solve an ancient mystery. You can get this at newsstands, grocery stores and so forth. I also, I ordered it from Amazon and then this one is very nice. This is the Dead Sea Scrolls. The subtitle is 75 years since their historic discovery. Both of these are worth having, but I would want the VanderKam and Flant the book. Most of the people listening to me in this audience I think are really good students and they like to study. Now that's in English. If you study Hebrew, which I know some of you do, you want to get it. It'll have a different cover. This is an edition I've had for several years. I think it's red now. Anyway, it's called the Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition. Be careful if you order it because there's a study edition that is just English, but as you see when I open this up, get a nice page of Hebrew here to show you. You can see you've got the English on one side and the Hebrew on the other. This is Martinez, the editor. Florentino Martinez. He's a good friend of mine. I see him at conferences. He works in Spain, in Madrid, I think, or maybe Barcelona. Yeah, I think Barcelona, but he's provided this wonderful study edition for students who want to read the Dead Sea Scrolls with Hebrew as well. Let me also mention that's introductory that I've recently put on my YouTube channel, which is, let's see, James Tabor videos. You can find it on YouTube. I've been putting up a lot of things. I've put up some things even this morning, but I've got three recent lectures that I did at the Biblical Archaeology Seminar over the years. One is called, let's see, I wrote this down, the exact names. Who wrote the Scrolls? So you can look at that. Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return. And I didn't tend that title to be kind of shocking or provocative, but at the end, I say, you know, one thing about all Messiahs, they've all died and they haven't come back yet. And I was mainly talking about the Teacher of Righteousness, who's the leader of the Dead Sea Scroll community. And then a third video, the Dead Sea Scroll calendar. You know, there are several Jewish calendars that are being used in the time of the Second Temple period for Christians the time of Jesus. There are three different main calendars, a lunar calendar, a solar lunar calendar, a solar calendar, and then it has to do with how you calculate the months and so forth. And I've got those up. And if you go to my blog, JamesTabor.com, I upload some documents. Here's a sample. These are printed documents that you can look at that go with the videos. So that's enough for education. The only other thing I would mention is the Wikipedia article. I know professors are not supposed to recommend Wikipedia to their students, but you know what, some of the Wikipedia articles are just excellent. If you want to go into some controversial thing or political thing, they can be tough. And I know religion can be controversial, but something like the Dead Sea Scrolls, the videos are, I mean, the articles in Wikipedia are fabulous. They really are. Very, very complete article. So that would be a good thing to read, too. You can print it out and study it if you don't know about the, much about the Dead Sea Scrolls. So I hope this lecture or lesson or class, I guess I could call it, would encourage you to delve into the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves. They certainly are the greatest archaeological discovery in our time. And I want to mention one other book. I think I have it here somewhere. Let's see. I thought I laid it down. It's, I was going to show Ross's book. Yeah, I got it. Because this is about a Dead Sea Scroll as well. The question is, was it a forgery or was it authentic or a genuine scroll? And then when would it date? So if you haven't heard about this, it was featured the other night on Coast to Coast. It's really getting out there and Ross has got a whole slate of interviews set up as a result of this book. So you should, most of you, I think many of you in this audience have heard of this, but in the back, there's a translation of what might be maybe the oldest and most important of all the Dead Sea Scrolls. We haven't been able to find it because it's disappeared, but Ross does a good transcription and translation of it. And I want to include that as well as part of the Dead Sea Scrolls. To read more about that, just go to themosiscroll.com, which is Ross's website. You can order the book through several means, including Amazon. Amazon, I think, is the publisher of it, or not the publisher, but the vehicle through which it was published. And also a blog where Nichols has put up a whole lot of entries about the scroll and everything about it. And in the last issue of Bar Magazine, I wrote an article with Edan Dershowitz, who's also working with us on the Moses Scroll, arguing that it is very likely authentic, that it's an authentic Dead Sea Scroll. But that's not what I'm talking about today. So all of that is plummeting. So what are the Dead Sea Scrolls? We've got 15,000 manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts. That's huge, representing probably 600 different works or books. And yet some of the books that are represented might just have a teeny piece or two that you could fit on just one page and just a fragment. And some of the fragments are the size of like a matchbook cover or even a thumbnail with only a couple of letters. So when we say 15,000 fragments, don't get too excited like you're going to have complete copies of things. However, there are some complete copies of some of the scrolls. They were mostly found in Cave 1 and then Cave 11 and then the Copper Scroll in Cave 3. And Cave 1 was just a treasure because you had something called the Community Rule, which is the charter of the group that wrote the scrolls or wrote the sectarian scrolls. I'll explain that in a minute as to what these 600 books are. Books that they wrote about their own group and their own movement kind of like the Christians have the New Testament as their writings. So the Dead Sea Scroll group had their own writings. And another one is the Thanksgiving Hymns, which some of which were written by the teacher, their leader, we think, like he uses the first person. We think he actually wrote these. So we've got that from Cave 1. You've got as well the War Scroll from Cave 1 and a number of other scrolls that are very complete. So if you break down the scrolls, about 30% of them are written by the group. We call them the sectarian scrolls. These are the scrolls where the group is talking about how they were formed and what they're all about and what their vision of things is and what their history is and so forth. So that's like almost a third are written by the group. And those are the ones I specialize in. And then there's another 30% that are copies of texts that they didn't write, but texts that are not the Hebrew Bible, but books that you would recognize the names of, even if you haven't read them, like Jubilees, the Book of Jubilees. They love the Book of Jubilees. It fits their solar calendar that they used. And Enoch, not all of Enoch because Enoch is an Ethiopic, the complete thing that we now have, but they had of the five parts of Enoch, they had four of them and they did use them. And in fact, some of the Aramaic Enoch texts are the oldest copies of Enoch that we have. And Enoch is quoted in the New Testament in the Book of Jude. And there are a lot of other references in the New Testament, just allusions to some of the language of the Book of Enoch. So people in the Second Temple period from, let's say, about the Maccabees down through Bar Kokba, or down through the destruction of Jerusalem and on to Bar Kokba, 1st century CE, they're making use of these books and using them all during that period. And then what we want to do today, 40% of the Dead Sea Scrolls are copies of books of the Hebrew Bible. So I want to introduce you to a book if you don't know it. I highly, highly recommend this book. I'm going to read you the blurb on it in just a minute, but I want you to be able to see it or get a screenshot of it. The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible, the oldest known Bible translated for the first time into English. And the authors are Abeg, Flint, and Ulrich. And it's really an amazing production. So what is this? Of those 40% of the Dead Sea Scrolls, of the 1500 fragments, 600 volumes, the ones that are copies of the Bible are in this book. So you actually have the Dead Sea Scroll Bible. What it says at the top, over a thousand years older than any previously discovered biblical manuscripts with material never before published or translated, including hundreds of new and different readings and several lost Psalms that actually could conceivably go into the book of Psalms. There's a Psalm 151, for example, that the Oxford Annotated RSV actually includes as well as the new Oxford RSV. So highly recommend this book, because this is what I'm going to talk from today. So who wrote the scrolls just before we start? Who is this group so that we know something about them? I could give a complete lecture on that, and I did. I mentioned I have a lecture on YouTube, and you can find it on YouTube and listen to it with a lot of supplementary material on my blog that goes with it. But usually people say, oh, the S-scenes wrote the scrolls. The Dead Sea Scroll group are the S-scenes. Well, obviously they didn't write all the scrolls, because you've got books like Jubilee's and Enoch that they didn't write, and you've got the Hebrew Bible, which they didn't write. But that 30% is written by the group, and some of those even by the teacher himself. And so we could talk about scrolls that they wrote and who they were. I don't think the word S-scene is very helpful. I think the group that wrote the scrolls is described by Josephus as the S-scenes. So if you go to book two of the Jewish war, you can read his long description of the S-scenes. And he's very positive about them. But remember, he's writing for the impervest patient. He's living in Rome. It's around 75 CE after the destruction of Jerusalem. And he wants to talk about the traditions of the Jewish people and the schools, philosophical schools, as the way he describes them. Pharisees, Sadducees, and S-scenes. And so he presents them in Hellenistic guard. And also he presents them in ways that the emperor would not find objectionable. Now that we have the scrolls, you can call them S-scenes if you want, but don't go to Josephus for your definition of S-scenes because he makes them kind of quietists and pacifists and they're a secluded group. They sound a lot like the Pythagoreans. And then of course he makes the Pharisees sound like Epicureans. And he makes, I'm sorry, the Sadducees. And then the Pharisees he would make, he would describe in ways that would remind you of the Platonists, or particularly the Stoics probably. So you see what he's doing. So to understand the Dead Sea Scroll group, again, it's better to read their own self-description. And what they, what we come up with, if you read the Dead Sea Scrolls, the books that they wrote, I would describe them like this. You ready? An apocalyptic, messianic, new covenant group, baptizing, you have to be baptized, and I'm using, it's a mikvah, it's Jewish mikvah, but probably in a running stream like the Jordan River, or the Dead Sea. You could presumably be baptized in the Dead Sea because you probably want to hold your eyes really tight when you go under, but you could do that. And maybe they did baptize in the Dead Sea. So apocalyptic, messianic, new covenant. They claimed that they were the people of the new covenant. They were, God has established the new covenant. They were the ones separatists, communal living, and preparing the way in the desert, the Aravah, Isaiah 40, verse three. Just as the New Testament opens in the Gospel of Mark, with John the baptizer out in the desert, along the Jordan Valley, preaching and baptizing and people and people say, who are you? And he says, I'm the voice of one calling in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord. So when I say they're people of the way, that might remind you of something in the Book of Acts, the New Testament Book of Acts, because they also pick up the same language. So people of the way means people of the desert way, people that are following the Torah, according to the interpretations of this group, and what we call halakha or interpretations of Torah. So whether you call them messians or not, basically go to the scrolls for a definition. Now, none of those terms would describe the Pharisees. None of those terms would describe the Sadducees. And yet those terms do describe this group. And I would say every one of those terms also describes the Jesus movement. So when the scrolls were discovered, people were very, very excited and keen, but also a little nervous, because it's like we found an apocalyptic messianic group thinking they're preparing the way in the wilderness, saying they're people of the New Covenant, communal living, separatists, baptizing into the group and so forth. They're doing all of these things. And basically my screen went out. I'm going to put it back. It doesn't matter, but I'd rather not talk to a blank screen. So give me just a second. I need to probably, sorry about that. This is probably going to happen over and over. So anyway, where was I? I was talking about the, oh, how people were maybe a bit nervous because they would think, well, you know, is this like a precursor of the Jesus movement? Or, you know, did the Jesus move a kind of copy or did they come from this group or whatever? But we're not going to talk about that today. So, but it is a good topic to talk about the relationship of the Jesus movement, the John the Baptist movement, followers of James the brother of Jesus, how they might have related to the Dead Sea Scroll group. I've written a lot about that in my books, such as the Jesus Diocese. Now, as far as the 40% of the scrolls that do have the Hebrew copies of the Hebrew Bible, there's one book supposedly missing. And it just so happens that it's not missing anymore. Some of you who want to look this up, you could paste the URL maybe in one of the chats on YouTube or Facebook. But recently, just recently, the book of Esther has been identified as fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls. So if you've ever heard, and you still read this, if you look it up, that they had copies of all the books of the Hebrew Bible, except for Esther in the Amaya. Well, Esther has now been located. And it's an article at the website, thetora.com. So if you go to thetora.com, it's called newly deciphered Comron Scroll revealed to be Esther. So it's really easy to find. It's by, let's see, Rabbi Asher Tovlev. And it's a really exciting story because you know why they hadn't identified Esther? Because somebody spilled some wine on it. And it was stained and you couldn't make it out. But now through photographic means, they've been able to make it out, which is really amazing. So what we want to do today, I'm going to switch on my reading light here, where I can see better what I want to do is I want to take this Dead Sea Scroll Bible. And I want to pick five different, let's see, is it five or six, one, two, three, actually, it's four different references, but some of them have more than one. I'm going to pick four or five places within here. You see, I've got a mark here, where the Hebrew Bible that we have, the Masoretic text differs from the readings that are in the scrolls. And that's what I want to talk about. Now, here's the problem with that. Many people talk about the Hebrew Bible. I've got a Hebrew Bible right here. This is the standard scholarly edition of the Hebrew Bible. It's called the BHS, Biblia Hebraica Stuttgart, Densia Stuttgart, the German. It's where it was put out, put in Latin. It's referred to as the BHS. And you can see here on the page, if I put it really close at the bottom, that you've got all of these variant readings. So even though people talk about, I want to go by the Masoretic text, you have to realize even the Masoretic text, the traditional Hebrew text, like some of you use the Koran Bible, K-O-R-E-N. It's a standardized text that's been standardized by the rabbis of hundreds of years ago, but there are variants. And many of you probably remember or know Bart Ehrman, who is the New Testament scholar. And he was trained at Princeton. And when he learned as a student that there are all these variants in the New Testament, it really disturbed him because he was raised as a very conservative Christian and whatever the traditional Byzantine texts of the Greek New Testament said, he just felt it had to be perfect without any kind of mistakes or variants. And then when he began going to graduate school and finding out that there are literally hundreds of variants, now what you'll often hear is, well, the Masoretic text, it doesn't have any variants. You know how people count the letters and they do these Bible code things. But all you need is one variant and the whole Bible code is thrown off, right? Because all the letters would then shift even by one letter. And so I'm not too fond of the Bible code concept because I happen to know that the text you're searching is just one of several copies of the Masoretic text. The one that is used by in the BHS is the Leningrad Codex. It's the oldest copy of the Hebrew Bible Masoretic text, as we call it. The traditional texts is maybe another way to refer to it. That's complete. There's the Aleppo Codex that's a little bit older, but part of it was destroyed by actually anti-Semites who raided the place and tried to burn the scroll. But fortunately, most of it did survive and it's on display in Jerusalem. If you've been there and seen that, it's in the shrine of the book there in Jerusalem. So anyway, when you talk about the Hebrew Bible, here's what we've got. We've got the Masoretic text, but it does have variations. At the bottom of every page, you can see these other readings of other copies of it because copyists make mistakes and variations creep in over the centuries. We've also got what's called the Septuagint, LXX. You'll see it abbreviated. That's a translation of the Hebrew Bible that we think was made in the second century, DCE. And we do have manuscripts of the Septuagint, quite a few that have survived. And it doesn't always read the same as the Hebrew Bible either. So you've got other versions. And then the Samaritan Pentateuch. Now that's only the five books of Moses, but the Samaritan Pentateuch does differ in places with the Masoretic texts. So that would be three different versions of the Torah, at least. And of the Hebrew Bible in general, you would have two versions, the Masoretic texts with its variants, as well as the Septuagint. And of course, the Septuagint would have variants also. And then you add the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is not complete because we don't have absolute copies of every single book of the Hebrew Bible. But it is, in fact, another tradition. And sometimes the readings of the Dead Sea Scrolls agree with this Septuagint. The first or second example we're going to have today, we're going to consider today, actually agrees with the Greek, not the Masoretic texts. And so scholars have been busy now for 75 years doing all of these comparisons and trying to figure it out. This bothers some people. I hope it doesn't bother you who are listening. I don't want it to bother you. Tell my students, I don't want it to bother them either. Because what you don't want to do is trade one fundamentalism for another. Many of, I was raised in a fairly conservative Christian tradition. And the tradition I came out of, the Campbellite or Churches of Christ, they would have said by and large, although they're probably liberalized a little here and there over the years. But they would have said, you know, the Bible is inspired and it's perfect and it has no mistakes. And they just don't like variations. And yet there are variations. When I first took Greek, I've got my Greek New Testament here. This is the Greek New Testament. And you can see it's very, very similar. It's got all of those variations at the bottom of the Greek text. So we shouldn't wish for something that we don't have. We have different versions of the Hebrew Bible, different versions of the New Testament, actually different versions of every single book from antiquity. This is actually a treasure of riches. We want that sort of thing because we want all the possible information we can. Now, when the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, Cave One, there were 10 jars and only one had scrolls. And Cave One in the jar with the seven scrolls that were in that jar was a complete copy of the book of Isaiah. I've got a book over here with the original colored pictures that Trevor did, the scholar Trevor living in Jerusalem at the Albright. Beautiful pictures that are still used today in color. So everybody wondered, well, if you compared the Isaiah of the Masoretic text, the traditional Hebrew text, with the Dead Sea Scroll copy, because the Leningrad Codex, the oldest copy of the Masoretic text, is about a thousand AD CE. And the Dead Sea Scroll Isaiah is probably 150-200 BCE. So you've jumped back over a thousand years, probably 1200 years. It's hard to date exactly. But in that amazing, so you want to kind of compare it. It is our book of Isaiah. It has the same number of sections and chapters and it essentially has the same contents. But there are thousands of variations where it reads differently. And sometimes those variations agree with the Septuagint or the Samaritan penitent. Now usually, people will say, well, it was essentially the same. And that's true. And it's also false. But it probably depends on what you mean essentially. It is essentially the same. But essentially the same doesn't mean you shouldn't notice the differences, as I'm going to show you today, because the differences could be significant. And get ready for this. Some of the readings in the Dead Sea Scrolls parallel the Moses Scroll. And Ross Nichols is currently working on a project to compare all the readings of the Dead Sea Scrolls of Deuteronomy. And did you know some of those are Paleo-Ebru, actually written in the ancient script, with the Moses Scroll transcript that we have. And that's going to be a pretty long project. But he has begun that project. So that's going to be pretty interesting. And I'm going to show you one of those today, one of the parallels, where the Moses Scroll reads the same as one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is very, very interesting. It sounds like maybe it's not a forgery, because I don't think Moses Shapiro had copies of the Comron Scrolls, at least, that were found in 1947. I would encourage you all to, when you think about, you know, fundamentalism and the Hebrew faith, and what it is to follow the God of Israel, and so forth, to have an open view that there are pillars of the faith, the call of Abraham, the Torah given at Sinai, the prophets, and so forth, that seem to be bedrock for all forms of Judaism and Hebrew faith, even Gentiles that adhere to the Hebrew faith. But essentially, you know, you don't have to have a set view of what the text has to be, if it doesn't conform to what we're discovering or what the facts are. And I think most of the people in these particular audiences of the United Israel World Union, which is sponsoring this talk that I'm presenting here, this class, I think most of the people who follow Ross Nichols' teaching week by week, he teaches on this channel every week at the same time. And you're used to this, like you want all the scholarly information possible, and I'm glad that that's the case. It's not a threat, it's a treasure trove of riches to delve into these things. So let's start with Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 12. If you have a Hebrew Bible, whatever translation doesn't matter, because it'll probably be the Messeridic text, go ahead and turn to Deuteronomy 5, and you will then have the standard version of the traditional Hebrew text. So it's on page 154 in this Dead Sea Scrolls Bible. If you have the book, you can follow along with the book. And it has to do with the 10 words. One of the ways of describing people say, what is United Israel World Union? It was formed in 1944 by a Jewish correspondent and Bible student. His name was David Horowitz. And David Horowitz coined the idea of decalogue faith for all nations. And we like that very much. The idea would be the essential faith around the 10 words, the 10 commandments, should be for the whole world, not simply for Jews. And so the decalogue faith. And as you know, one command of the decalogue faith is, in fact, the Sabbath, to keep the Sabbath. Today is the Sabbath. So either remember or observe the Sabbath day. So verse 12 does in fact say, observe the Sabbath day, keep it holy, as the Lord commanded you. And it's actually the divine name, Y-H-V-H, which they write in Paleo Hebrew, by the way. Six days you will labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God, and so forth. You should do no work. Now in Deuteronomy, you have this idea that the reason you do this is because God brought the people of Israel out of Egypt. And that's also in Exodus 31 as the reason. But as you know, there's also the idea that God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day, so that the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it. Now that's not in the Masoretic text at this spot of Deuteronomy. It is in the Moses scroll. So there's the example. And there's one of this, the Dead Sea Scroll copy. It's actually 4Q Deuteronomy. It's called from Cave 4. It's a fragment of Deuteronomy. It has the idea that the Sabbath goes back to the creation. So it's connecting to Genesis 1 and 2 in the same way that the Moses scroll does. And if you compare Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, you can see the two versions. So this could be seen as an attempt to harmonize, like let's give both reasons. But on the other hand, it could also be seen as maybe a tradition that the Dead Sea Scroll group is preserving that would be older than the later tradition that we know as the Masoretic text. So that's the first example I want to give. The second one is a couple of verses. It's in what's called the Song of Moses, and it's Deuteronomy 32. So if you go to Deuteronomy 32, and you can see down at verse 8, a very well-known verse that says, when the Most High separated or gave to the nations their inheritance, he separated humankind, and he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel. That's the Masoretic text. That's probably what the translation says that most of you are reading, depending on which one you're reading. However, in the Dead Sea Scroll portion, it says, according to the sons of Elohim, the children of God, and it uses Elohim. Isn't that interesting? Because Elohim is also used in the Moses Scroll, as you know. Many of you know read about it or read the book. So the sons of Elohim. Now the sons of Elohim could be considered the children of Israel, I suppose, but because of another verse in this same chapter, or in the same song, if you go down to verse 43, it's pretty clear that it's talking about the sons of God, or the Bene Elohim, as it is in Hebrew, that are the hosts that surround God. Did I say Psalm 82? Remember, it talks about how God sits and is surrounded by all of these gods, or Elohim. So here's what verse 43 says in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and this would be a 4-Q Deuteronomy also. K-4, the copy of Deuteronomy. It reads like this. This is going to be different from what you have if you have the Maseridic text. Rejoice, O heavens, together with him, and bow down to him all you gods, for he will avenge the blood of his sons, his children, his banim, and will render vengeance to his enemies, and will recompense those who hate him, and will atone for the land of his people. And so it's actually talking about bow down to him you gods, this reference to you gods, or in the Sattuagen even has sons of God, which seems again to be these ruling powers that are spoken of a number of times in the Hebrew Bible. I think I have this book handy, let's see. If I do have it handy, I recommend. This includes the New Testament too, but the part on the Hebrew Bible is really good. Michael Heiser's book, The Unseen Realm. Michael has an article online. You can look it up called The Bene Elohim, The Sons of God. It's really good. He did his dissertation on that subject, and he's a real expert on it. It's something to really study. So here you have a text in the Dead Sea Scrolls that is talking about the Bene Elohim as seemingly parallel to Psalm 82, meaning these heavenly beings, not simply talking about the flesh and blood Israelites. So I think that's pretty interesting as we go along. Now, Isaiah 53. Isaiah 53 is really, really interesting. It was in Cave One in that jar that had the seven scrolls, and it's a complete copy of Isaiah. Actually, I'm going to pull up my copy here to show you because it's so beautiful. I want you to see, and I think this is the color one. Yep, this is the color one. So you can buy this. These are the photographs that Trevor originally made. You've got the black and white in the color. Absolutely gorgeous photographs. If you've been to Israel and been to the shrine of the book, there's a replica of this scroll wrapped around the central scroll display area where you can see it almost like it's wrapped around like a Torah scroll. And Israelis have fun taking their kids to see the Dead Sea Scrolls because any kid in Israel can just read Isaiah right off the page, even though it's in this Herodian script. So it's pretty amazing how things have not changed. However, does Isaiah have changes? Often, I remember when I first studied this, I was in a more conservative school, Abilene Christian University, and there was more an emphasis on, you know, it's basically the same as the Masoretic Text, and it is. It's basically the same as the Masoretic Text, and it's quite remarkable that Isaiah is preserved to that degree. However, it does have interesting readings that are different. A few of them are pretty minor, but I'm going to mention a few of them, but some of them are quite strikingly different. So Isaiah 53, which is the famous Suffering Servant Hymn of Isaiah, one of the four Suffering Servant Hymns, as they're traditionally known by scholars, Hebrew Bible scholars. And I'm going to read verse three. He was despised and rejected by others, and, I'm reading the Dead Sea version, and a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering, and like one from whom people hide their faces, and we despised him and did not value him. So the footnote explains that he was despised is the Masoretic Text. Remember, he was despised and rejected. Many people have that memorized. Notice this says we despised him, and so in the Dead Sea Squall version of Isaiah, it's in the first person that we, and that would go with verse four. Surely he has borne our sufferings and so forth. If you go on down to, let's see, verse eight, in the middle of verse, just the last part of verse eight, for he was cut off from the land of the living. He was stricken for the transgression of my people, and it's actually his people. Instead of Ami, it's Ammo, his people in the Dead Sea version. Does that make a difference? Does that make a difference? Well, you can write it down and study it and think about it. You have to read the whole chapter and think about it. But this is a version that has some parallels. And remember, some of these are also, these readings that we're going over today, are also paralleled in the Septuagint, the Greek translation, meaning that the Greek translators were also using a copy of the Hebrew Bible that would be closer to what we have in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Verse nine says, And they made his grave with the wicked. I believe the Masoretic text has he made, doesn't it? Let's see. He made maybe? Yeah. They made. So it's plural. They made his grave with the wicked, and with rich people his tomb. And if you remember, the Masoretic text has this strange plural with a rich man in his death's plural. And some people have really gotten off on that and talked to try to apply it to Jesus and say, well, maybe he survived the cross and then died later. So he has deaths, not death and all kinds of ideas people have come up with. But this just says, with rich people was his tomb. As he was buried in a tomb, or this person's buried in a tomb, I'm not talking about Jesus here, although he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth. Yet the Lord, and this is Yodhe Vavhe Hashem, but the Lord was willing to crush him, and he made him suffer. So I think, let's see, he made him suffer, MT. Right. That's, I'm not sure that, I don't have the MT open, so I'm not sure that that's not so significant for us right now. Now here's the one I think is most interesting, verse 11. You ready? Verse 11. When I first studied the Dead Sea Scrolls, I did a number of interviews. I remember Zola Levitt. Any of you remember Zola Levitt? Had that very popular TV program. He was very excited about this reading of the scroll. Because in the Dead Sea copy of the scrolls, it says, out of his suffering, his soul will see light. Out of his suffering, his soul will see light and find satisfaction. The idea of his soul seeing light is not in the Masoretic text. There's nothing like that. It just says he will see the suffering of his soul. But to see light or his very, very diffidence, very clear in the scrolls, what that would mean? It was interpreted probably by second temple groups that might have used a text like this to maybe mean resurrection. Because toward the end, it talks about him seeing his offspring and rejoicing and so forth and dividing the spoil. And so you could see how the Dead Sea Scroll group would think that their teacher, who they felt fulfilled this, the teacher of righteousness they called him, he was their leader, and they saw him as a kind of a new Moses. But they would feel that basically that this person maybe is going to suffer and be buried, but also see light. And I cover that in my lecture, Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return, because they expected him to return and he simply didn't. There's some other things. This book is nice because whenever there's a difference, it puts it in italics. And otherwise, it's the Masoretic Text. So it's really easy to use. And then you look down on the footnote and you see what the Masoretic Text had, what the Septuagint had, and what the Samaritan Pentateuch had. So Isaiah 53 is interesting. There's some differences that might be significant. Finally, and I think this one is really, really interesting, Malachi, the last of the Hebrew prophets, the famous passage in chapter three that is quoted in the New Testament and applied to John the Baptizer, I call him the Baptizer, Yocanon Hamat Ville, John the Dipper. I'll read it to you in the scroll version. You ready? Therefore, behold, I send my messenger and he will prepare the way before me and they will suddenly come to his temple, the Lord whom you seek and the messenger of the covenant whom you desire. Behold, he himself comes, says Hashem of hosts, the Lord of hosts, the Eternal of hosts, but who can endure them? They come, meaning when they come is the idea. Now, did you notice any difference in what you probably have, the Masoretic text? It looks like it's two figures, two messiahs. The Lord here is not the divine name when the Lord comes to his temple. That's Adon, L-O-R-D, the Lord, the master, the Adon of the earth, so to speak, could be a Messiah figure. So let me read it again. Therefore, I will send my messenger, that's one figure, he will prepare the way before me and they will suddenly come to his temple, the Lord whom you seek and the messenger of the covenant. This group believed in two messiahs. They believed in a priestly messiah, this Dead Sea Scroll group, and a Davidic messiah. So they believe that both messiahs were coming, and here you see two are talked about in the Dead Sea Scroll version of Malachi. And then, excuse me, let me get a little drink of water. Who can endure them when they come? Who can endure them when they come? Which is original? I'm just tempted to think that the plural is the more original because we have texts like Zachariah 6 that talks about the two messiahs. Earlier in Zachariah, with the two olive branches and the lamp stand, there are the two sons of fresh oil, one on the right and one on the left. And in Zachariah 6, you talk about the Davidic figure, the branch sitting on his throne, and then a priest standing by his side. So when you read the Dead Sea Scrolls, they believe in the coming of two messiahs. They talk about the coming of the messiahs of Israel and Aaron. Israel would be the messiah of Israel, the Davidic ruler, the king, and the messiah of Aaron would be the priest. So the Dead Sea Scroll group had three figures. I've written a lot about this. I've got articles about it. I've got an article on my blog called 123 messiahs question mark. So you can look that up jamestaber.com if you want to read more about that. But I'm thinking during the Second Temple period, there were expectations for three figures. If you go by the scrolls, here are the figures. A prophet like Moses, a kind of second Moses who would come, sort of middle figure. That would be the lampstand figure who's the adorn of the whole earth, the Lord of the whole earth. And he's able to inaugurate the new covenant. That was their view. And they believe that he had come, the teacher of righteousness. They say things about him that are quite extravagant. For example, they say to him, God has made known all the mysteries of the prophets, all the mysteries of the prophets. Amazing. And we have books like the Habakkuk Peshir. That was also cave one. And that one jar, one of the seven scrolls that was found. It's in the translation. You can read it. And it takes the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible book of Habakkuk and then interprets it verse by verse. But it sees it in the light of the history of the group, the Dead Sea Scroll Group, so that they actually apply it to their teacher. So the lecture I gave or the YouTube video I gave was a bar lecture, biblical archaeology, society lecture. Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return goes into that in great detail, so you can listen to that to get more details. But I'm thinking that essentially they're waiting, they have him, and then they're waiting for the two Messiahs. But I don't see any evidence in any of the scrolls that the two Messiahs ever showed up. And what happens is the teacher's killed. And on Yom Kippur, the priest, the wicked, he's called the wicked priest, because he's the priest they think is illegitimate, the priest in Jerusalem, probably one of the high priests that we know about. Depending on when you date the scrolls, it could go anywhere from the Maccabean period down to even into the first century. I tend to think the teacher thrived in the first century BC. But we have priests all the way through that period that are serving in the temple, and Josephus preserves their names. We have all the names of these priests during this period. Well, this group considers one of them a wicked priest, and he comes down on Yom Kippur. Now, here's a question. How could he travel on Yom Kippur to the desert community at Comronus? I mean, I'm assuming for now that Comronus is where the group was and where the teacher was. And some people would say there's no absolute evidence for that. But I think it's a good possibility. How would he come on Yom Kippur? Isn't the high priest in Jerusalem supposed to go into the temple on Yom Kippur? So he couldn't be traveling down and persecuting this teacher of Comron unless they're using a different calendar. And they are. Constantly on the scrolls, it says over and over again that I'm looking at my text messages. Sorry, getting buzzed, but it's just this, that, and the other. Constantly you read about the idea of the calendar being different in the days, months, seasons, and years being different because they're using a solar calendar. And it's a beautiful calendar. It's a very interesting calendar of, if you take a look at my YouTube lecture on my YouTube channel, it's called the Essene calendar made simple. Believe it or not, you can make it simple and you can even put it on a single page. I've got somewhere a page. I don't know if I have it right here, but I'm going to put it up on my blog with that lecture where you can see what kind of calendar they had. As far as I know, these two messiahs, though, didn't come. So the wicked priest, as his call came down and persecuted the teacher, it's possible the teacher was killed. Maybe we're not absolutely sure about that. And then the group decides that the end will come because remember it's an apocalyptic group. They think they're going to live to see the end just like the followers of Jesus. And it didn't come. And they say it's going to come in about 40 years. And then when 40 years passed, they, instead of losing their faith, they talk about God has prolonged the seasons, has prolonged the time. Very similar to the kind of thing you find, say, in Peter, I think, isn't it? Second Peter, God's long suffering. You know, he doesn't always do things according to what people thought. And they also conclude that all the times predicted by the book of Daniel have been fulfilled, but the end didn't come. Therefore, not that we're wrong, but, you know, that our interpretation is wrong, that they weren't fulfilled, because they haven't been fulfilled. They believe that God is giving more grace, more time, and it's going to be longer. And even though the date was right, God decided not to send the wrath and the judgment and the end of the age on time, which would have been 40 years after the death of the teacher. How did they come up with that 40 years? They believe there's a final cycle of 10 jubilees, 49-year jubilees, 490 years. They interpret Daniel 9, the so-called 70 weeks prophecy, and they've placed their teacher in the 10th week. And then they begin to talk about in the final 49-year period, everything will come, and then it didn't come. It didn't happen. And so they're basically disappointed. And they decide that God has decided to prolong the days. How long did the movement last? It's hard to know, but given this flexibility with the text of Habakkuk, I think we could presume that they went into the first century. I would think some of the followers of John the Baptist and Jesus might have had grandparents and parents that had known the teacher and maybe were kind of part of that general Messianic movement. Eisman calls it the Messianic movement of Palestine. He uses the term Palestine, which the scholars use to describe the Holy Land, but the Messianic movement of the land of Israel. And I would say that there are probably remnants of that, because if you look at the Jesus movement, there's just, as I mentioned, a lot of parallels. Not only the apocalyptic wilderness, new covenant kind of thing, but also the idea of sacred meals, a bread and wine that you couldn't partake of. It's called the pure meal of the saints, the specified ones. They're very separationist in terms of their piety and their idea. They have a council of 12 and an inner council of three. Does that remind you of anything? And yet the Jesus movement is very, very different from what you read in the scrolls in terms of interpreting the Torah. The best example in this lecture is not on that, but I want to kind of close with this, where you get a feeling of what they're all about. In the scrolls, it says that if a beast or animal falls into a pit on the Sabbath, you must not help the animal out, because it's the Sabbath. And there's a command in the Sabbath that you stay in your dwelling. And they took that very literally. Literally, you don't leave the camp. By the way, latrines, they don't even go outside the camp on the Sabbath to go to the toilet. Josephus mentions that about the Essenes. He presents it as something admirable, like, wow, they're so dedicated. They go for 24 hours without going to the toilet. And some of you know that Josephus and I, a few years ago, we think we discovered the latrines that come run exactly as the scrolls describe northwest of the camp, 1,000 cubits to 2,000 cubits away from the camp, hidden from view, is the area where we did soil samples and we think we located their latrines. There's a cemetery nearby with over 1,100 graves, mostly male, and there's some dispute about the female, because there are a few women, and they haven't all been excavated just to sample. But Zias thinks that the women are later burials of veteran women. They just took advantage of a local cemetery. They're not ancient. But by far, most of them are men, and therefore possibly come run as a celibate community. So you do get these parallels, which also get differences. Jesus says, I think it's in Luke, which of you would not take a beast out of a pit on the Sabbath, as if to say, anybody would do that. And believe me, you know, this picking grain on the Sabbath story that's in Mark chapter 2 and Matthew chapter 12, where the disciples picked grain. The scrolls specifically say that you must prepare your meals before the Sabbath. That's in the Torah, right? So you can, that's considered, you didn't prepare that before the Sabbath. Also, it's threshing or harvesting, which is forbidden on the Sabbath. So they, the scroll people back in the days of the teacher in the time when these things were written, the sectarian scrolls, they would just be appalled that the disciples of Jesus are harvesting barley and popping the grain in their mouth when they're famished. And if you remember, the response of Jesus was not like, oh, well, sorry, we broke the law, but it was basically like, well, you know, the Sabbath's made for people, not people for the Sabbath. So the idea of being humane to an animal or taking care of human need on the Sabbath, which the Pharisees also taught, and they made certain allowances to allow you to keep the Sabbath in less of a strict way. Whereas the carites later did not. And I'd have to check with Namia Gordon to see today how they're defining the dwelling. Because if you can't go out of your house during the Sabbath, you're dwelling. Does that mean your literal house you live in, like the rooms you inhabit or apartment? Or does it mean your town? Or does it mean your city? If you're in a large city, all these things are interpreted differently by Judaism over the years. Some of you might know there is around the city of Jerusalem today a wire or thread like element upon poles all the way around the city. And that the rabbis define Jerusalem as the dwelling of the people in Jerusalem. So you don't go out of your dwelling, meaning you don't go out of the city of Jerusalem, but you can go anywhere in the city of Jerusalem. This group would have been horrified at any of those kinds of interpretations. I think they would have been very upset with Jesus for any number of things that he did. So I don't think Jesus is part of this. Some people think John the Baptist is and they try to make him really rigid and conservative. But you know, the only traditions we have of John the Baptist, he's actually pretty accommodating. He talks to Roman soldiers. He talks to tax collectors and blesses them and says, you're fine. You can come in the movement. Of course, everybody has to repent. But I mean, he seems like he's more accepting. I would put John the Baptist Jesus and James sort of on a plane, even though they might have had some differences. So this is an election on the Jesus movement, but because it's another parallel second temple, apocalyptic movement of the time I want to mention it. So they're taking both movements, the Jesus movement and the Dead Sea Scroll movement. They're reading these texts and we have to wonder what version. We know the Qumran group was reading the version that we just studied, but is there evidence that in the New Testament that some of the texts that were being quoted were actually, they're quoting more the Septuagint or the Dead Sea Scrolls and the answer is yes. That's why some of the readings differ quite a bit, because they're quoting a different version. They're not just changing the Bible they're using. I guess you could say a different text of that particular book of the Bible. So I hope that has been interesting to you. You'll get the Dead Sea Scroll Bible, delve into it. I'm particularly excited about what Ross will be able to uncover in looking at all the scrolls of Deuteronomy from the Dead Sea's collection and comparing them to the Shapira Scroll. As I said earlier, that could be quite telling because Shapira would not have known these versions of Deuteronomy in Hebrew if there are parallels and we've already seen a couple. Then how would he have forged the document and made up readings that are later going to be discovered in 1947 in caves? But remember he found the Moses Scroll in a cave wrapped in land with the sticky residue around it. It sounds kind of like the discovery of the Qumran Scrolls. So some of you are going on the trip with us in October and we'll do other trips as well in the future if you can't make this one. But one of the things we're going to do is stay in the desert for three nights I think and we're going to visit Qumran and we're going to visit Masada and we're going to walk around these caves and it's going to be very exciting. Dead Sea Scroll news breaks all the time like that Esther Scroll discovery that I just told you about. During the time I've been teaching my Dead Sea Scroll class this semester we've had several major news stories on the Dead Sea Scrolls break. So it's really an exciting field to be in. I'm really really interested and fascinated with the Dead Sea Scrolls. I've studied them for years and I hope this will encourage all of you to study them too. So Shabbat Shalom and wish you all well. Thank you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 8.040000000000001, "text": " to get started here. Hope everybody can see and hear okay.
