0	8040	to get started here. Hope everybody can see and hear okay. So today I'm going to
8040	14360	talk to you about the Dead Sea Scrolls Bible and I'm using Bible and scare
14360	20760	quotes because obviously nobody was carrying around the Dead Sea, you know,
20760	26600	a printed Bible or even a handwritten Bible. But the books that are part of the
26600	34040	Hebrew Bible, they are represented in the Dead Sea Scroll Library to some extent
34040	39880	and that's what I want to talk about. Just as I start I want to introduce you
39880	45560	to some resources because I'm teaching a course this semester on the Dead Sea Scrolls
45560	50600	so I have everything right here and I know many of you are very interested. I
50600	57400	would say the number one book that I would recommend, I got to figure out how
57400	62920	to show this at the right angle without the glare, but it's Vander Cam and Flint.
62920	68480	I think you all can see that. The meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls, you can get it in
68480	75360	paperback. Highly recommended. This is the book on the scrolls. You really need
75360	80320	it to be able to talk much about the scrolls or all of their background and
80320	85320	to know the history and what they contain and who wrote them and how to date them
85320	90320	and all the theories, all the interpretations. That book is a book
90320	96320	that I always use and with all of my students. And as far as reading the
96320	100800	scrolls, which is also important, I always tell the story in the 90s when I was
100800	105920	lecturing here in Charlotte, North Carolina. When the scrolls were on exhibit
105920	110280	here in Charlotte and there was this huge exhibit and we had a lecture at the
110280	114920	Jewish Community Center. It was standing room only. It was unbelievable. They had
114920	119280	to get chairs and open up the side. Everybody's interested in the scrolls
119280	125120	and they had just been released through Robert Eisenman's efforts and Herschel
125120	131680	Shanks at Bar Magazine and others. I was somewhat involved in that. And after my
131680	135880	lecture, a woman came up and she said, oh Dr. Tabor, I'm so glad we have the
135880	141880	scrolls finally because about probably a third of the scrolls had not been
141880	146080	released until the 90s. So there was a big campaign. Some of you will remember
146080	152280	Herschel Shanks really spearheaded it in Bar Magazine, but Robert Eisenman I think
152280	156360	was really behind the scenes. And he's the one who actually got the photographs
156360	161840	and then had them published. And then they were all public finally. So this is
161840	169560	the complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English. It's a penguin paperback. The editor is
169560	176880	Geza Vermish, V-E-R-M-E-S. I guess his name is not even on the front, but it's on
176880	182520	the side I think. Not even the side. So he didn't write them. He doesn't want his
182520	188080	name on, but he's the translator and it's a great addition. It has over a hundred
188120	195520	pages of introductory material and then it also has lots of commentary and
195520	199560	helps as you read the scrolls. But the main thing is it has the scrolls in
199560	205880	English. So I really want to recommend this. So this woman was saying, oh I love
205880	210840	the scrolls and I had a version of an earlier version of this and I said, oh
210840	216040	have you read them yet? And she goes, oh no I haven't read them, but I just love
216160	220920	that we have them. So I think a lot of people are in that situation where we
220920	224720	talk about, oh finally we got the scrolls, but then you don't even read them.
224720	230080	Maybe kind of like the Bible with people who love that we have the Bible, but
230080	235720	they've never read it. Then I want to mention this is the year of the scrolls
235720	242720	because here's a life magazine, the Dead Sea Scrolls, after 75 years. The race to
242760	248240	solve an ancient mystery. You can get this at newsstands, grocery stores and so
248240	254600	forth. I also, I ordered it from Amazon and then this one is very nice. This is
254600	259920	the Dead Sea Scrolls. The subtitle is 75 years since their historic discovery.
259920	264760	Both of these are worth having, but I would want the VanderKam and Flant the
264760	270960	book. Most of the people listening to me in this audience I think are really good
271000	277280	students and they like to study. Now that's in English. If you study Hebrew,
277280	282240	which I know some of you do, you want to get it. It'll have a different cover.
282240	287480	This is an edition I've had for several years. I think it's red now. Anyway, it's
287480	292560	called the Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition. Be careful if you order it because
292560	296600	there's a study edition that is just English, but as you see when I open this
296640	302880	up, get a nice page of Hebrew here to show you. You can see you've got the
302880	308960	English on one side and the Hebrew on the other. This is Martinez, the editor.
308960	315520	Florentino Martinez. He's a good friend of mine. I see him at conferences. He works
315520	320840	in Spain, in Madrid, I think, or maybe Barcelona. Yeah, I think Barcelona, but
320840	328840	he's provided this wonderful study edition for students who want to read
328840	334960	the Dead Sea Scrolls with Hebrew as well. Let me also mention that's
335000	341720	introductory that I've recently put on my YouTube channel, which is, let's see,
341800	347400	James Tabor videos. You can find it on YouTube. I've been putting up a lot of
347440	351800	things. I've put up some things even this morning, but I've got three recent
351800	360040	lectures that I did at the Biblical Archaeology Seminar over the years. One is
360040	368240	called, let's see, I wrote this down, the exact names. Who wrote the Scrolls? So you
368240	375480	can look at that. Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return. And I didn't tend that title to
375480	380280	be kind of shocking or provocative, but at the end, I say, you know, one thing
380280	385600	about all Messiahs, they've all died and they haven't come back yet. And I was
385600	389640	mainly talking about the Teacher of Righteousness, who's the leader of the
389640	395200	Dead Sea Scroll community. And then a third video, the Dead Sea Scroll calendar.
396000	400680	You know, there are several Jewish calendars that are being used in the
400720	406400	time of the Second Temple period for Christians the time of Jesus. There are
406400	410720	three different main calendars, a lunar calendar, a solar lunar calendar, a
410720	416440	solar calendar, and then it has to do with how you calculate the months and so
416440	424800	forth. And I've got those up. And if you go to my blog, JamesTabor.com, I upload
424800	430640	some documents. Here's a sample. These are printed documents that you can look
430720	435640	at that go with the videos. So that's enough for education. The only other
435640	439880	thing I would mention is the Wikipedia article. I know professors are not
439880	445040	supposed to recommend Wikipedia to their students, but you know what, some of the
445040	450880	Wikipedia articles are just excellent. If you want to go into some controversial
450880	455840	thing or political thing, they can be tough. And I know religion can be
455840	460360	controversial, but something like the Dead Sea Scrolls, the videos are, I mean,
461360	465760	the articles in Wikipedia are fabulous. They really are. Very, very complete
465760	469360	article. So that would be a good thing to read, too. You can print it out and
469360	474280	study it if you don't know about the, much about the Dead Sea Scrolls. So I
474280	481320	hope this lecture or lesson or class, I guess I could call it, would encourage
481320	486280	you to delve into the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves. They certainly are the
486280	493120	greatest archaeological discovery in our time. And I want to mention one
493120	499360	other book. I think I have it here somewhere. Let's see. I thought I laid it
499360	506200	down. It's, I was going to show Ross's book. Yeah, I got it. Because this is
506200	510400	about a Dead Sea Scroll as well. The question is, was it a forgery or was it
510400	514800	authentic or a genuine scroll? And then when would it date? So if you haven't
514800	518680	heard about this, it was featured the other night on Coast to Coast. It's
518680	525760	really getting out there and Ross has got a whole slate of interviews set up as a
525760	530840	result of this book. So you should, most of you, I think many of you in this
530840	535840	audience have heard of this, but in the back, there's a translation of what
535840	540560	might be maybe the oldest and most important of all the Dead Sea Scrolls.
540600	546320	We haven't been able to find it because it's disappeared, but Ross does a good
546320	551480	transcription and translation of it. And I want to include that as well as part
551480	557640	of the Dead Sea Scrolls. To read more about that, just go to themosiscroll.com,
557640	561960	which is Ross's website. You can order the book through several means,
561960	567160	including Amazon. Amazon, I think, is the publisher of it, or not the publisher,
567160	572840	but the vehicle through which it was published. And also a blog where Nichols
572840	578120	has put up a whole lot of entries about the scroll and everything about it. And
578120	583680	in the last issue of Bar Magazine, I wrote an article with Edan Dershowitz,
583680	590120	who's also working with us on the Moses Scroll, arguing that it is very likely
590120	594680	authentic, that it's an authentic Dead Sea Scroll. But that's not what I'm talking
594720	600560	about today. So all of that is plummeting. So what are the Dead Sea Scrolls? We've
600560	608320	got 15,000 manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts. That's huge, representing
608320	615800	probably 600 different works or books. And yet some of the books that are
615800	620480	represented might just have a teeny piece or two that you could fit on just one
620520	624880	page and just a fragment. And some of the fragments are the size of like a
624880	629720	matchbook cover or even a thumbnail with only a couple of letters. So when we say
629720	634520	15,000 fragments, don't get too excited like you're going to have complete
634520	640640	copies of things. However, there are some complete copies of some of the scrolls.
640640	646200	They were mostly found in Cave 1 and then Cave 11 and then the Copper Scroll in
646240	652640	Cave 3. And Cave 1 was just a treasure because you had something called the
652640	658800	Community Rule, which is the charter of the group that wrote the scrolls or wrote
658800	663960	the sectarian scrolls. I'll explain that in a minute as to what these 600 books
663960	668800	are. Books that they wrote about their own group and their own movement kind of
668800	673440	like the Christians have the New Testament as their writings. So the Dead Sea
673480	681680	Scroll group had their own writings. And another one is the Thanksgiving Hymns,
681680	687040	which some of which were written by the teacher, their leader, we think, like he
687040	691480	uses the first person. We think he actually wrote these. So we've got that
691480	698160	from Cave 1. You've got as well the War Scroll from Cave 1 and a number of other
698160	705000	scrolls that are very complete. So if you break down the scrolls, about 30% of
705000	710000	them are written by the group. We call them the sectarian scrolls. These are the
710000	715040	scrolls where the group is talking about how they were formed and what they're
715040	719440	all about and what their vision of things is and what their history is and so
719440	726400	forth. So that's like almost a third are written by the group. And those are the
726440	733000	ones I specialize in. And then there's another 30% that are copies of texts that
733000	738400	they didn't write, but texts that are not the Hebrew Bible, but books that you
738400	742680	would recognize the names of, even if you haven't read them, like Jubilees, the
742680	747040	Book of Jubilees. They love the Book of Jubilees. It fits their solar calendar
747040	754160	that they used. And Enoch, not all of Enoch because Enoch is an Ethiopic, the
754240	759320	complete thing that we now have, but they had of the five parts of Enoch, they
759320	765720	had four of them and they did use them. And in fact, some of the Aramaic Enoch
765720	769880	texts are the oldest copies of Enoch that we have. And Enoch is quoted in
769880	775760	the New Testament in the Book of Jude. And there are a lot of other references
775760	780080	in the New Testament, just allusions to some of the language of the Book of
780080	787600	Enoch. So people in the Second Temple period from, let's say, about the Maccabees
787600	792120	down through Bar Kokba, or down through the destruction of Jerusalem and on to
792120	800560	Bar Kokba, 1st century CE, they're making use of these books and using them
800560	806440	all during that period. And then what we want to do today, 40% of the Dead Sea
806480	813000	Scrolls are copies of books of the Hebrew Bible. So I want to introduce you to a
813000	819520	book if you don't know it. I highly, highly recommend this book. I'm going to
819520	824760	read you the blurb on it in just a minute, but I want you to be able to see it
824760	830440	or get a screenshot of it. The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible, the oldest known Bible
830440	837840	translated for the first time into English. And the authors are Abeg, Flint, and
837840	845960	Ulrich. And it's really an amazing production. So what is this? Of those 40% of
845960	854480	the Dead Sea Scrolls, of the 1500 fragments, 600 volumes, the ones that
854480	859160	are copies of the Bible are in this book. So you actually have the Dead Sea Scroll
859200	865640	Bible. What it says at the top, over a thousand years older than any previously
865640	870800	discovered biblical manuscripts with material never before published or
870800	876600	translated, including hundreds of new and different readings and several lost
876600	887360	Psalms that actually could conceivably go into the book of Psalms. There's a Psalm
887400	892600	151, for example, that the Oxford Annotated RSV actually includes as well as
892600	899480	the new Oxford RSV. So highly recommend this book, because this is what I'm
899480	907240	going to talk from today. So who wrote the scrolls just before we start? Who is
907240	911240	this group so that we know something about them? I could give a complete
911240	915680	lecture on that, and I did. I mentioned I have a lecture on YouTube, and you can
915680	919840	find it on YouTube and listen to it with a lot of supplementary material on my
919840	926040	blog that goes with it. But usually people say, oh, the S-scenes wrote the
926040	931160	scrolls. The Dead Sea Scroll group are the S-scenes. Well, obviously they didn't
931160	934880	write all the scrolls, because you've got books like Jubilee's and Enoch that they
934880	939720	didn't write, and you've got the Hebrew Bible, which they didn't write. But that
939760	946960	30% is written by the group, and some of those even by the teacher himself. And so
946960	953240	we could talk about scrolls that they wrote and who they were. I don't think
953240	958200	the word S-scene is very helpful. I think the group that wrote the scrolls is
958200	964840	described by Josephus as the S-scenes. So if you go to book two of the Jewish
964960	970280	war, you can read his long description of the S-scenes. And he's very positive
970280	975560	about them. But remember, he's writing for the impervest patient. He's living in
975560	984560	Rome. It's around 75 CE after the destruction of Jerusalem. And he wants to
984600	990520	talk about the traditions of the Jewish people and the schools, philosophical
990560	996440	schools, as the way he describes them. Pharisees, Sadducees, and S-scenes. And so
996440	1002080	he presents them in Hellenistic guard. And also he presents them in ways that the
1002080	1009040	emperor would not find objectionable. Now that we have the scrolls, you can call
1009040	1014240	them S-scenes if you want, but don't go to Josephus for your definition of S-scenes
1014960	1020440	because he makes them kind of quietists and pacifists and they're a secluded
1020440	1025600	group. They sound a lot like the Pythagoreans. And then of course he makes
1025600	1033120	the Pharisees sound like Epicureans. And he makes, I'm sorry, the Sadducees. And
1033120	1038400	then the Pharisees he would make, he would describe in ways that would remind
1038400	1042680	you of the Platonists, or particularly the Stoics probably. So you see what he's
1042720	1048640	doing. So to understand the Dead Sea Scroll group, again, it's better to read
1048640	1053640	their own self-description. And what they, what we come up with, if you read the
1053640	1058840	Dead Sea Scrolls, the books that they wrote, I would describe them like this.
1058840	1067640	You ready? An apocalyptic, messianic, new covenant group, baptizing, you have to
1067640	1072560	be baptized, and I'm using, it's a mikvah, it's Jewish mikvah, but probably in
1072560	1078200	a running stream like the Jordan River, or the Dead Sea. You could presumably be
1078200	1082080	baptized in the Dead Sea because you probably want to hold your eyes really
1082080	1086000	tight when you go under, but you could do that. And maybe they did baptize in the
1086000	1092400	Dead Sea. So apocalyptic, messianic, new covenant. They claimed that they were the
1092400	1096760	people of the new covenant. They were, God has established the new covenant. They
1096920	1104560	were the ones separatists, communal living, and preparing the way in the desert, the
1104560	1111120	Aravah, Isaiah 40, verse three. Just as the New Testament opens in the Gospel of
1111120	1120000	Mark, with John the baptizer out in the desert, along the Jordan Valley, preaching
1120000	1125360	and baptizing and people and people say, who are you? And he says, I'm the voice of
1125400	1130080	one calling in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord. So when I say they're
1130080	1134480	people of the way, that might remind you of something in the Book of Acts, the
1134480	1139080	New Testament Book of Acts, because they also pick up the same language. So people
1139080	1145160	of the way means people of the desert way, people that are following the Torah,
1145520	1151640	according to the interpretations of this group, and what we call halakha or
1152640	1159920	interpretations of Torah. So whether you call them messians or not, basically go to
1159920	1165080	the scrolls for a definition. Now, none of those terms would describe the Pharisees.
1165320	1171080	None of those terms would describe the Sadducees. And yet those terms do describe
1171080	1175960	this group. And I would say every one of those terms also describes the Jesus
1175960	1180400	movement. So when the scrolls were discovered, people were very, very
1180400	1186440	excited and keen, but also a little nervous, because it's like we found an
1186440	1190560	apocalyptic messianic group thinking they're preparing the way in the
1190560	1195920	wilderness, saying they're people of the New Covenant, communal living, separatists,
1195960	1201440	baptizing into the group and so forth. They're doing all of these things. And
1202080	1206680	basically my screen went out. I'm going to put it back. It doesn't matter, but I'd
1206680	1212160	rather not talk to a blank screen. So give me just a second. I need to probably,
1213720	1221440	sorry about that. This is probably going to happen over and over. So anyway,
1223360	1229600	where was I? I was talking about the, oh, how people were maybe a bit nervous
1229600	1236440	because they would think, well, you know, is this like a precursor of the
1236440	1243360	Jesus movement? Or, you know, did the Jesus move a kind of copy or did they
1243360	1246280	come from this group or whatever? But we're not going to talk about that
1246280	1251160	today. So, but it is a good topic to talk about the relationship of the
1251160	1254680	Jesus movement, the John the Baptist movement, followers of James the
1254680	1258440	brother of Jesus, how they might have related to the Dead Sea Scroll group.
1258720	1265160	I've written a lot about that in my books, such as the Jesus Diocese. Now, as
1265160	1271560	far as the 40% of the scrolls that do have the Hebrew copies of the Hebrew
1271560	1278400	Bible, there's one book supposedly missing. And it just so happens that it's
1278400	1283080	not missing anymore. Some of you who want to look this up, you could paste the
1283080	1289960	URL maybe in one of the chats on YouTube or Facebook. But recently, just
1289960	1296640	recently, the book of Esther has been identified as fragments of the Dead Sea
1296640	1300280	Scrolls. So if you've ever heard, and you still read this, if you look it up,
1300840	1305680	that they had copies of all the books of the Hebrew Bible, except for Esther in
1305680	1310760	the Amaya. Well, Esther has now been located. And it's an article at the
1310760	1319040	website, thetora.com. So if you go to thetora.com, it's called newly deciphered
1319040	1324680	Comron Scroll revealed to be Esther. So it's really easy to find. It's by, let's
1324680	1330120	see, Rabbi Asher Tovlev. And it's a really exciting story because you know why
1330120	1335560	they hadn't identified Esther? Because somebody spilled some wine on it. And it
1335560	1339840	was stained and you couldn't make it out. But now through photographic means,
1339880	1346360	they've been able to make it out, which is really amazing. So what we want to do
1346360	1351520	today, I'm going to switch on my reading light here, where I can see better what
1351520	1359920	I want to do is I want to take this Dead Sea Scroll Bible. And I want to pick five
1359920	1368040	different, let's see, is it five or six, one, two, three, actually, it's four
1368040	1372040	different references, but some of them have more than one. I'm going to pick four
1372040	1380480	or five places within here. You see, I've got a mark here, where the Hebrew Bible
1380480	1384440	that we have, the Masoretic text differs from the readings that are in the
1384440	1388840	scrolls. And that's what I want to talk about. Now, here's the problem with that.
1388840	1394480	Many people talk about the Hebrew Bible. I've got a Hebrew Bible right here. This
1394600	1399440	is the standard scholarly edition of the Hebrew Bible. It's called the BHS,
1399440	1406280	Biblia Hebraica Stuttgart, Densia Stuttgart, the German. It's where it was put
1406280	1412840	out, put in Latin. It's referred to as the BHS. And you can see here on the page,
1412840	1417440	if I put it really close at the bottom, that you've got all of these variant
1417440	1423200	readings. So even though people talk about, I want to go by the Masoretic text,
1423240	1428480	you have to realize even the Masoretic text, the traditional Hebrew text, like
1428480	1437400	some of you use the Koran Bible, K-O-R-E-N. It's a standardized text that's
1437400	1443440	been standardized by the rabbis of hundreds of years ago, but there are
1443440	1450680	variants. And many of you probably remember or know Bart Ehrman, who is the
1450680	1455920	New Testament scholar. And he was trained at Princeton. And when he learned as a
1455920	1460560	student that there are all these variants in the New Testament, it really
1460560	1464440	disturbed him because he was raised as a very conservative Christian and
1464440	1470840	whatever the traditional Byzantine texts of the Greek New Testament said, he
1470840	1475400	just felt it had to be perfect without any kind of mistakes or variants. And
1475400	1479120	then when he began going to graduate school and finding out that there are
1479160	1483520	literally hundreds of variants, now what you'll often hear is, well, the Masoretic
1483520	1487440	text, it doesn't have any variants. You know how people count the letters and
1487440	1491520	they do these Bible code things. But all you need is one variant and the whole
1491520	1496120	Bible code is thrown off, right? Because all the letters would then shift even by
1496120	1501800	one letter. And so I'm not too fond of the Bible code concept because I happen
1501800	1507480	to know that the text you're searching is just one of several copies of the
1507480	1514800	Masoretic text. The one that is used by in the BHS is the Leningrad Codex. It's
1514800	1520800	the oldest copy of the Hebrew Bible Masoretic text, as we call it. The
1520800	1526720	traditional texts is maybe another way to refer to it. That's complete. There's
1526720	1532440	the Aleppo Codex that's a little bit older, but part of it was destroyed by
1532440	1538040	actually anti-Semites who raided the place and tried to burn the scroll. But
1538320	1543040	fortunately, most of it did survive and it's on display in Jerusalem. If you've
1543600	1549480	been there and seen that, it's in the shrine of the book there in Jerusalem. So
1549480	1552880	anyway, when you talk about the Hebrew Bible, here's what we've got. We've got
1552880	1558080	the Masoretic text, but it does have variations. At the bottom of every page,
1558080	1563400	you can see these other readings of other copies of it because copyists make
1563400	1570240	mistakes and variations creep in over the centuries. We've also got what's
1570240	1577120	called the Septuagint, LXX. You'll see it abbreviated. That's a translation of
1577120	1584000	the Hebrew Bible that we think was made in the second century, DCE. And we do
1584000	1588640	have manuscripts of the Septuagint, quite a few that have survived. And it
1588640	1592240	doesn't always read the same as the Hebrew Bible either. So you've got other
1592240	1598400	versions. And then the Samaritan Pentateuch. Now that's only the five books of
1598400	1604400	Moses, but the Samaritan Pentateuch does differ in places with the Masoretic
1604400	1610200	texts. So that would be three different versions of the Torah, at least. And of
1610200	1614120	the Hebrew Bible in general, you would have two versions, the Masoretic texts
1614120	1618240	with its variants, as well as the Septuagint. And of course, the Septuagint
1618240	1624360	would have variants also. And then you add the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is not
1624360	1630960	complete because we don't have absolute copies of every single book of the
1630960	1638240	Hebrew Bible. But it is, in fact, another tradition. And sometimes the readings of
1638280	1643640	the Dead Sea Scrolls agree with this Septuagint. The first or second
1643640	1648240	example we're going to have today, we're going to consider today, actually agrees
1648240	1656160	with the Greek, not the Masoretic texts. And so scholars have been busy now for
1656160	1662080	75 years doing all of these comparisons and trying to figure it out. This
1662080	1667120	bothers some people. I hope it doesn't bother you who are listening. I don't
1667120	1671120	want it to bother you. Tell my students, I don't want it to bother them either.
1671920	1678680	Because what you don't want to do is trade one fundamentalism for another. Many
1678680	1685480	of, I was raised in a fairly conservative Christian tradition. And the
1685480	1690200	tradition I came out of, the Campbellite or Churches of Christ, they would have
1690200	1694240	said by and large, although they're probably liberalized a little here and
1694280	1698680	there over the years. But they would have said, you know, the Bible is inspired
1698680	1703360	and it's perfect and it has no mistakes. And they just don't like variations. And
1703360	1707480	yet there are variations. When I first took Greek, I've got my Greek New
1707480	1712120	Testament here. This is the Greek New Testament. And you can see it's very,
1712120	1717560	very similar. It's got all of those variations at the bottom of the Greek
1717560	1722360	text. So we shouldn't wish for something that we don't have. We have
1722360	1726400	different versions of the Hebrew Bible, different versions of the New
1726400	1731920	Testament, actually different versions of every single book from antiquity. This
1731920	1740120	is actually a treasure of riches. We want that sort of thing because we want
1740120	1745120	all the possible information we can. Now, when the Dead Sea Scrolls were
1745120	1753520	discovered, Cave One, there were 10 jars and only one had scrolls. And Cave
1753520	1758240	One in the jar with the seven scrolls that were in that jar was a complete copy
1758240	1762320	of the book of Isaiah. I've got a book over here with the original colored
1762320	1768320	pictures that Trevor did, the scholar Trevor living in Jerusalem at the
1768320	1774760	Albright. Beautiful pictures that are still used today in color. So everybody
1774760	1778680	wondered, well, if you compared the Isaiah of the Masoretic text, the
1778680	1783960	traditional Hebrew text, with the Dead Sea Scroll copy, because the Leningrad
1783960	1791920	Codex, the oldest copy of the Masoretic text, is about a thousand AD CE. And the
1791920	1798920	Dead Sea Scroll Isaiah is probably 150-200 BCE. So you've jumped back over a
1798920	1805600	thousand years, probably 1200 years. It's hard to date exactly. But in that
1805600	1809640	amazing, so you want to kind of compare it. It is our book of Isaiah. It has the
1809640	1815320	same number of sections and chapters and it essentially has the same contents. But
1815320	1819880	there are thousands of variations where it reads differently. And sometimes those
1819880	1825640	variations agree with the Septuagint or the Samaritan penitent. Now usually,
1825680	1830120	people will say, well, it was essentially the same. And that's true. And it's also
1830120	1835920	false. But it probably depends on what you mean essentially. It is
1835920	1840520	essentially the same. But essentially the same doesn't mean you shouldn't notice
1840520	1844200	the differences, as I'm going to show you today, because the differences could be
1844200	1850720	significant. And get ready for this. Some of the readings in the Dead Sea Scrolls
1851040	1857400	parallel the Moses Scroll. And Ross Nichols is currently working on a project to
1857400	1862400	compare all the readings of the Dead Sea Scrolls of Deuteronomy. And did you know
1862400	1868040	some of those are Paleo-Ebru, actually written in the ancient script, with the
1868040	1873000	Moses Scroll transcript that we have. And that's going to be a pretty long
1873000	1877440	project. But he has begun that project. So that's going to be pretty interesting.
1877480	1881360	And I'm going to show you one of those today, one of the parallels, where the
1881360	1887160	Moses Scroll reads the same as one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is very,
1887160	1892560	very interesting. It sounds like maybe it's not a forgery, because I don't
1892560	1898160	think Moses Shapiro had copies of the Comron Scrolls, at least, that were
1898160	1907040	found in 1947. I would encourage you all to, when you think about, you know,
1907080	1912360	fundamentalism and the Hebrew faith, and what it is to follow the God of Israel,
1912360	1919600	and so forth, to have an open view that there are pillars of the faith, the
1919600	1926240	call of Abraham, the Torah given at Sinai, the prophets, and so forth, that
1926240	1932240	seem to be bedrock for all forms of Judaism and Hebrew faith, even Gentiles
1932240	1938680	that adhere to the Hebrew faith. But essentially, you know, you don't have
1938680	1944680	to have a set view of what the text has to be, if it doesn't conform to what
1945120	1950360	we're discovering or what the facts are. And I think most of the people in
1950360	1955080	these particular audiences of the United Israel World Union, which is sponsoring
1955080	1962200	this talk that I'm presenting here, this class, I think most of the people who
1962520	1967120	follow Ross Nichols' teaching week by week, he teaches on this channel every
1967560	1973080	week at the same time. And you're used to this, like you want all the
1973080	1977880	scholarly information possible, and I'm glad that that's the case. It's not a
1977880	1984520	threat, it's a treasure trove of riches to delve into these things. So let's
1984520	1991520	start with Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 12. If you have a Hebrew Bible, whatever
1991560	1996960	translation doesn't matter, because it'll probably be the Messeridic text, go
1996960	2003320	ahead and turn to Deuteronomy 5, and you will then have the standard version of
2003320	2009840	the traditional Hebrew text. So it's on page 154 in this Dead Sea Scrolls Bible.
2009840	2016920	If you have the book, you can follow along with the book. And it has to do
2016920	2022000	with the 10 words. One of the ways of describing people say, what is United
2022000	2029640	Israel World Union? It was formed in 1944 by a Jewish correspondent and Bible
2029640	2036840	student. His name was David Horowitz. And David Horowitz coined the idea of
2036840	2042600	decalogue faith for all nations. And we like that very much. The idea would be
2042600	2049040	the essential faith around the 10 words, the 10 commandments, should be for the
2049040	2054880	whole world, not simply for Jews. And so the decalogue faith. And as you know, one
2054880	2061760	command of the decalogue faith is, in fact, the Sabbath, to keep the Sabbath.
2061760	2067760	Today is the Sabbath. So either remember or observe the Sabbath day. So verse 12
2067760	2072800	does in fact say, observe the Sabbath day, keep it holy, as the Lord commanded you.
2072800	2078520	And it's actually the divine name, Y-H-V-H, which they write in Paleo Hebrew, by
2078520	2083200	the way. Six days you will labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a
2083200	2090320	Sabbath to the Lord your God, and so forth. You should do no work. Now in Deuteronomy,
2090320	2097120	you have this idea that the reason you do this is because God brought the people
2097120	2104040	of Israel out of Egypt. And that's also in Exodus 31 as the reason. But as you
2104040	2111080	know, there's also the idea that God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath. For in
2111080	2115880	six days the Lord made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is in them, and
2115880	2121840	rested the seventh day, so that the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.
2122280	2130080	Now that's not in the Masoretic text at this spot of Deuteronomy. It is in the
2130080	2136440	Moses scroll. So there's the example. And there's one of this, the Dead Sea Scroll
2136440	2142160	copy. It's actually 4Q Deuteronomy. It's called from Cave 4. It's a fragment of
2142160	2147560	Deuteronomy. It has the idea that the Sabbath goes back to the creation. So
2147560	2153440	it's connecting to Genesis 1 and 2 in the same way that the Moses scroll does.
2153440	2159280	And if you compare Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, you can see the two
2159280	2165600	versions. So this could be seen as an attempt to harmonize, like let's give
2165600	2172920	both reasons. But on the other hand, it could also be seen as maybe a tradition
2172960	2177040	that the Dead Sea Scroll group is preserving that would be older than
2177040	2182840	the later tradition that we know as the Masoretic text. So that's the first
2182840	2189160	example I want to give. The second one is a couple of verses. It's in what's
2189160	2196120	called the Song of Moses, and it's Deuteronomy 32. So if you go to Deuteronomy
2196160	2206680	32, and you can see down at verse 8, a very well-known verse that says,
2206680	2213920	when the Most High separated or gave to the nations their inheritance, he
2213920	2219960	separated humankind, and he set the bounds of the peoples according to the
2219960	2225560	number of the children of Israel. That's the Masoretic text. That's probably what
2225880	2230520	the translation says that most of you are reading, depending on which one you're
2230520	2239240	reading. However, in the Dead Sea Scroll portion, it says, according to the
2240280	2246680	sons of Elohim, the children of God, and it uses Elohim. Isn't that interesting?
2246680	2251640	Because Elohim is also used in the Moses Scroll, as you know. Many of you know
2251880	2259400	read about it or read the book. So the sons of Elohim. Now the sons of Elohim
2259400	2264040	could be considered the children of Israel, I suppose, but because of another
2264040	2270200	verse in this same chapter, or in the same song, if you go down to verse 43,
2270760	2277640	it's pretty clear that it's talking about the sons of God, or the Bene Elohim,
2277640	2282520	as it is in Hebrew, that are the hosts that surround God.
2284040	2289640	Did I say Psalm 82? Remember, it talks about how God sits and is surrounded
2290600	2299080	by all of these gods, or Elohim. So here's what verse 43 says in the Dead Sea Scrolls,
2299080	2305960	and this would be a 4-Q Deuteronomy also. K-4, the copy of Deuteronomy.
2306520	2310520	It reads like this. This is going to be different from what you have if you have the
2310520	2317880	Maseridic text. Rejoice, O heavens, together with him, and bow down to him all you gods,
2318440	2322520	for he will avenge the blood of his sons, his children, his
2323800	2330280	banim, and will render vengeance to his enemies, and will recompense those who hate him, and will
2330280	2337960	atone for the land of his people. And so it's actually talking about bow down to him you gods,
2337960	2346840	this reference to you gods, or in the Sattuagen even has sons of God, which seems again to be these
2349640	2354760	ruling powers that are spoken of a number of times in the Hebrew Bible. I think I have this
2354840	2362440	book handy, let's see. If I do have it handy, I recommend. This includes the New Testament too,
2362440	2367000	but the part on the Hebrew Bible is really good. Michael Heiser's book, The Unseen Realm.
2368600	2373960	Michael has an article online. You can look it up called The Bene Elohim, The Sons of God. It's
2373960	2378760	really good. He did his dissertation on that subject, and he's a real expert on it. It's
2378760	2385400	something to really study. So here you have a text in the Dead Sea Scrolls that is talking about the
2385400	2394120	Bene Elohim as seemingly parallel to Psalm 82, meaning these heavenly beings, not simply talking
2394120	2399960	about the flesh and blood Israelites. So I think that's pretty interesting as we go along.
2400120	2409160	Now, Isaiah 53. Isaiah 53 is really, really interesting. It was in Cave One in that jar
2409160	2415000	that had the seven scrolls, and it's a complete copy of Isaiah. Actually, I'm going to pull up
2415000	2425080	my copy here to show you because it's so beautiful. I want you to see, and I think this is the color
2425160	2431720	one. Yep, this is the color one. So you can buy this. These are the photographs that Trevor
2431720	2438520	originally made. You've got the black and white in the color. Absolutely gorgeous photographs. If
2438520	2444520	you've been to Israel and been to the shrine of the book, there's a replica of this scroll wrapped
2444520	2452200	around the central scroll display area where you can see it almost like it's wrapped around
2452200	2460040	like a Torah scroll. And Israelis have fun taking their kids to see the Dead Sea Scrolls because
2460040	2466120	any kid in Israel can just read Isaiah right off the page, even though it's in this Herodian script.
2466120	2473400	So it's pretty amazing how things have not changed. However, does Isaiah have changes?
2473400	2479160	Often, I remember when I first studied this, I was in a more conservative school, Abilene
2479160	2484200	Christian University, and there was more an emphasis on, you know, it's basically the same
2484200	2489240	as the Masoretic Text, and it is. It's basically the same as the Masoretic Text, and it's quite
2489240	2495800	remarkable that Isaiah is preserved to that degree. However, it does have interesting readings that are
2495800	2503640	different. A few of them are pretty minor, but I'm going to mention a few of them, but some of them
2503880	2511480	are quite strikingly different. So Isaiah 53, which is the famous Suffering Servant Hymn of Isaiah,
2511480	2518280	one of the four Suffering Servant Hymns, as they're traditionally known by scholars,
2518280	2524760	Hebrew Bible scholars. And I'm going to read verse three. He was despised and rejected by others,
2525720	2533320	and, I'm reading the Dead Sea version, and a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering,
2534280	2545160	and like one from whom people hide their faces, and we despised him and did not value him.
2546200	2553720	So the footnote explains that he was despised is the Masoretic Text. Remember, he was despised and
2553720	2560280	rejected. Many people have that memorized. Notice this says we despised him, and so in the Dead Sea
2560280	2567560	Squall version of Isaiah, it's in the first person that we, and that would go with verse four.
2567560	2575240	Surely he has borne our sufferings and so forth. If you go on down to, let's see, verse eight,
2577080	2582520	in the middle of verse, just the last part of verse eight, for he was cut off from the land of
2582520	2592520	the living. He was stricken for the transgression of my people, and it's actually his people.
2593400	2599720	Instead of Ami, it's Ammo, his people in the Dead Sea version. Does that make a difference? Does
2599720	2604920	that make a difference? Well, you can write it down and study it and think about it. You have to
2604920	2610600	read the whole chapter and think about it. But this is a version that has some parallels. And
2610680	2617960	remember, some of these are also, these readings that we're going over today, are also paralleled in
2617960	2623800	the Septuagint, the Greek translation, meaning that the Greek translators were also using a copy of
2623800	2630760	the Hebrew Bible that would be closer to what we have in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Verse nine says,
2630760	2639800	And they made his grave with the wicked. I believe the Masoretic text has he made, doesn't it? Let's
2639800	2647560	see. He made maybe? Yeah. They made. So it's plural. They made his grave with the wicked,
2647560	2654280	and with rich people his tomb. And if you remember, the Masoretic text has this strange plural
2654920	2662120	with a rich man in his death's plural. And some people have really gotten off on that and talked
2662120	2668440	to try to apply it to Jesus and say, well, maybe he survived the cross and then died later. So he
2668440	2675080	has deaths, not death and all kinds of ideas people have come up with. But this just says,
2675080	2684520	with rich people was his tomb. As he was buried in a tomb, or this person's buried in a tomb,
2684520	2690120	I'm not talking about Jesus here, although he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth.
2692040	2698760	Yet the Lord, and this is Yodhe Vavhe Hashem, but the Lord was willing to crush him,
2699320	2710680	and he made him suffer. So I think, let's see, he made him suffer, MT. Right. That's,
2711640	2717480	I'm not sure that, I don't have the MT open, so I'm not sure that that's not so significant for us
2717480	2724680	right now. Now here's the one I think is most interesting, verse 11. You ready? Verse 11. When
2724680	2730920	I first studied the Dead Sea Scrolls, I did a number of interviews. I remember Zola Levitt.
2730920	2736600	Any of you remember Zola Levitt? Had that very popular TV program. He was very excited about
2736600	2743160	this reading of the scroll. Because in the Dead Sea copy of the scrolls, it says,
2743800	2751720	out of his suffering, his soul will see light. Out of his suffering, his soul will see light
2752680	2758200	and find satisfaction. The idea of his soul seeing light
2759960	2766120	is not in the Masoretic text. There's nothing like that. It just says he will see the suffering of
2766120	2773320	his soul. But to see light or his very, very diffidence, very clear in the scrolls, what that
2773320	2780760	would mean? It was interpreted probably by second temple groups that might have used a text like this
2781560	2786440	to maybe mean resurrection. Because toward the end, it talks about him
2789240	2796280	seeing his offspring and rejoicing and so forth and dividing the spoil. And so you could see how
2796280	2801720	the Dead Sea Scroll group would think that their teacher, who they felt fulfilled this, the teacher
2801720	2807640	of righteousness they called him, he was their leader, and they saw him as a kind of a new Moses.
2808200	2815320	But they would feel that basically that this person maybe is going to suffer and be buried,
2815320	2822360	but also see light. And I cover that in my lecture, Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return,
2823080	2826680	because they expected him to return and he simply didn't.
2829400	2834440	There's some other things. This book is nice because whenever there's a difference,
2834440	2841240	it puts it in italics. And otherwise, it's the Masoretic Text. So it's really easy to use. And
2841240	2847240	then you look down on the footnote and you see what the Masoretic Text had, what the Septuagint had,
2847240	2853640	and what the Samaritan Pentateuch had. So Isaiah 53 is interesting. There's some differences that
2853640	2861640	might be significant. Finally, and I think this one is really, really interesting, Malachi, the
2861640	2871560	last of the Hebrew prophets, the famous passage in chapter three that is quoted in the New Testament
2871560	2879000	and applied to John the Baptizer, I call him the Baptizer, Yocanon Hamat Ville, John the Dipper.
2880840	2888680	I'll read it to you in the scroll version. You ready? Therefore, behold, I send my messenger
2888680	2895640	and he will prepare the way before me and they will suddenly come to his temple, the Lord whom
2895640	2903720	you seek and the messenger of the covenant whom you desire. Behold, he himself comes, says Hashem
2903720	2909720	of hosts, the Lord of hosts, the Eternal of hosts, but who can endure them? They come,
2910840	2916600	meaning when they come is the idea. Now, did you notice any difference in what you probably have,
2916600	2925480	the Masoretic text? It looks like it's two figures, two messiahs. The Lord here is not the divine name
2927000	2932840	when the Lord comes to his temple. That's Adon, L-O-R-D, the Lord, the master, the Adon of the
2932840	2939320	earth, so to speak, could be a Messiah figure. So let me read it again. Therefore, I will send my
2939320	2946440	messenger, that's one figure, he will prepare the way before me and they will suddenly come to
2946440	2953960	his temple, the Lord whom you seek and the messenger of the covenant. This group believed in two
2953960	2960440	messiahs. They believed in a priestly messiah, this Dead Sea Scroll group, and a Davidic messiah.
2961000	2968520	So they believe that both messiahs were coming, and here you see two are talked about
2968520	2975880	in the Dead Sea Scroll version of Malachi. And then, excuse me, let me get a little drink of water.
2979880	2985400	Who can endure them when they come? Who can endure them when they come?
2985720	2996520	Which is original? I'm just tempted to think that the plural is the more original because we have
2996520	3004440	texts like Zachariah 6 that talks about the two messiahs. Earlier in Zachariah, with the two olive
3004440	3012520	branches and the lamp stand, there are the two sons of fresh oil, one on the right and one on the left.
3012520	3019160	And in Zachariah 6, you talk about the Davidic figure, the branch sitting on his throne,
3020040	3025640	and then a priest standing by his side. So when you read the Dead Sea Scrolls, they believe in the
3025640	3034040	coming of two messiahs. They talk about the coming of the messiahs of Israel and Aaron. Israel would
3034040	3041400	be the messiah of Israel, the Davidic ruler, the king, and the messiah of Aaron would be the priest.
3042680	3049240	So the Dead Sea Scroll group had three figures. I've written a lot about this. I've got articles
3049240	3055560	about it. I've got an article on my blog called 123 messiahs question mark. So you can look that up
3055560	3062440	jamestaber.com if you want to read more about that. But I'm thinking during the Second Temple period,
3063240	3069400	there were expectations for three figures. If you go by the scrolls, here are the figures.
3069480	3076040	A prophet like Moses, a kind of second Moses who would come, sort of middle figure. That would be
3076040	3083320	the lampstand figure who's the adorn of the whole earth, the Lord of the whole earth. And he's able
3083320	3090120	to inaugurate the new covenant. That was their view. And they believe that he had come, the teacher
3090120	3096920	of righteousness. They say things about him that are quite extravagant. For example, they say to
3096920	3104520	him, God has made known all the mysteries of the prophets, all the mysteries of the prophets. Amazing.
3105400	3111400	And we have books like the Habakkuk Peshir. That was also cave one. And that one jar, one of the
3111400	3118280	seven scrolls that was found. It's in the translation. You can read it. And it takes the Old Testament
3118280	3126440	or Hebrew Bible book of Habakkuk and then interprets it verse by verse. But it sees it in the light of
3126440	3133560	the history of the group, the Dead Sea Scroll Group, so that they actually apply it to their teacher.
3134200	3141560	So the lecture I gave or the YouTube video I gave was a bar lecture, biblical archaeology,
3141560	3148760	society lecture. Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return goes into that in great detail,
3148760	3158040	so you can listen to that to get more details. But I'm thinking that essentially they're waiting,
3158600	3163400	they have him, and then they're waiting for the two Messiahs. But I don't see any evidence in any
3163400	3168840	of the scrolls that the two Messiahs ever showed up. And what happens is the teacher's killed.
3169960	3176280	And on Yom Kippur, the priest, the wicked, he's called the wicked priest, because he's the priest
3176360	3182120	they think is illegitimate, the priest in Jerusalem, probably one of the high priests that we know about.
3182840	3189240	Depending on when you date the scrolls, it could go anywhere from the Maccabean period down to even
3189240	3198120	into the first century. I tend to think the teacher thrived in the first century BC. But we have priests
3198760	3203560	all the way through that period that are serving in the temple, and Josephus preserves their names.
3203560	3208760	We have all the names of these priests during this period. Well, this group considers one of them
3208760	3214760	a wicked priest, and he comes down on Yom Kippur. Now, here's a question. How could he travel on
3214760	3222120	Yom Kippur to the desert community at Comronus? I mean, I'm assuming for now that Comronus is
3222120	3227720	where the group was and where the teacher was. And some people would say there's no absolute
3227720	3232520	evidence for that. But I think it's a good possibility. How would he come on Yom Kippur?
3232520	3237960	Isn't the high priest in Jerusalem supposed to go into the temple on Yom Kippur? So he couldn't
3237960	3245880	be traveling down and persecuting this teacher of Comron unless they're using a different calendar.
3245880	3252600	And they are. Constantly on the scrolls, it says over and over again that I'm looking at my text
3252680	3262440	messages. Sorry, getting buzzed, but it's just this, that, and the other. Constantly you read about
3262440	3270600	the idea of the calendar being different in the days, months, seasons, and years being different
3270600	3276680	because they're using a solar calendar. And it's a beautiful calendar. It's a very interesting calendar
3276760	3286760	of, if you take a look at my YouTube lecture on my YouTube channel, it's called the Essene calendar
3286760	3291960	made simple. Believe it or not, you can make it simple and you can even put it on a single page.
3291960	3297560	I've got somewhere a page. I don't know if I have it right here, but I'm going to put it up on my
3297560	3303560	blog with that lecture where you can see what kind of calendar they had. As far as I know,
3304520	3309720	these two messiahs, though, didn't come. So the wicked priest, as his call came down and
3309720	3317080	persecuted the teacher, it's possible the teacher was killed. Maybe we're not absolutely sure about
3317080	3322920	that. And then the group decides that the end will come because remember it's an apocalyptic group.
3322920	3327560	They think they're going to live to see the end just like the followers of Jesus. And it didn't
3327560	3332520	come. And they say it's going to come in about 40 years. And then when 40 years passed, they,
3333160	3340920	instead of losing their faith, they talk about God has prolonged the seasons, has prolonged the
3340920	3347480	time. Very similar to the kind of thing you find, say, in Peter, I think, isn't it? Second Peter,
3347480	3351880	God's long suffering. You know, he doesn't always do things according to what people thought.
3352760	3359480	And they also conclude that all the times predicted by the book of Daniel have been
3359480	3367480	fulfilled, but the end didn't come. Therefore, not that we're wrong, but, you know, that our
3367480	3372120	interpretation is wrong, that they weren't fulfilled, because they haven't been fulfilled.
3372120	3378600	They believe that God is giving more grace, more time, and it's going to be longer. And even though
3378600	3386280	the date was right, God decided not to send the wrath and the judgment and the end of the age
3387080	3393160	on time, which would have been 40 years after the death of the teacher. How did they come up
3393160	3400600	with that 40 years? They believe there's a final cycle of 10 jubilees, 49-year jubilees, 490 years.
3401480	3410280	They interpret Daniel 9, the so-called 70 weeks prophecy, and they've placed their teacher in the
3410280	3419640	10th week. And then they begin to talk about in the final 49-year period, everything will come,
3419640	3425560	and then it didn't come. It didn't happen. And so they're basically disappointed. And they decide
3426760	3434360	that God has decided to prolong the days. How long did the movement last? It's hard to know,
3434360	3440520	but given this flexibility with the text of Habakkuk, I think we could presume that they went
3440520	3446680	into the first century. I would think some of the followers of John the Baptist and Jesus might have
3446680	3452920	had grandparents and parents that had known the teacher and maybe were kind of part of that general
3452920	3460600	Messianic movement. Eisman calls it the Messianic movement of Palestine. He uses the term Palestine,
3460680	3467240	which the scholars use to describe the Holy Land, but the Messianic movement of the land of Israel.
3468040	3475800	And I would say that there are probably remnants of that, because if you look at the Jesus movement,
3475800	3482440	there's just, as I mentioned, a lot of parallels. Not only the apocalyptic wilderness, new covenant
3482440	3491080	kind of thing, but also the idea of sacred meals, a bread and wine that you couldn't partake of.
3491080	3497240	It's called the pure meal of the saints, the specified ones. They're very separationist
3498440	3506520	in terms of their piety and their idea. They have a council of 12 and an inner council of three.
3506520	3513080	Does that remind you of anything? And yet the Jesus movement is very, very different from what
3513080	3519880	you read in the scrolls in terms of interpreting the Torah. The best example in this lecture is not
3519880	3523960	on that, but I want to kind of close with this, where you get a feeling of what they're all about.
3525480	3531000	In the scrolls, it says that if a beast or animal falls into a pit on the Sabbath,
3531000	3537160	you must not help the animal out, because it's the Sabbath. And there's a command in the Sabbath
3537160	3542520	that you stay in your dwelling. And they took that very literally. Literally, you don't leave the camp.
3544120	3551240	By the way, latrines, they don't even go outside the camp on the Sabbath to go to the toilet.
3551960	3556840	Josephus mentions that about the Essenes. He presents it as something admirable,
3557480	3562840	like, wow, they're so dedicated. They go for 24 hours without going to the toilet.
3563640	3570040	And some of you know that Josephus and I, a few years ago, we think we discovered the latrines
3570040	3577480	that come run exactly as the scrolls describe northwest of the camp, 1,000 cubits to 2,000
3577480	3585720	cubits away from the camp, hidden from view, is the area where we did soil samples and we think we
3585720	3593800	located their latrines. There's a cemetery nearby with over 1,100 graves, mostly male,
3593800	3597160	and there's some dispute about the female, because there are a few women,
3597800	3602840	and they haven't all been excavated just to sample. But Zias thinks that the women are
3602840	3608840	later burials of veteran women. They just took advantage of a local cemetery. They're not ancient.
3609480	3617880	But by far, most of them are men, and therefore possibly come run as a celibate community.
3618520	3623160	So you do get these parallels, which also get differences. Jesus says, I think it's in Luke,
3624280	3629240	which of you would not take a beast out of a pit on the Sabbath, as if to say,
3629880	3635400	anybody would do that. And believe me, you know, this picking grain on the Sabbath story that's
3635400	3642760	in Mark chapter 2 and Matthew chapter 12, where the disciples picked grain. The scrolls specifically
3642760	3649400	say that you must prepare your meals before the Sabbath. That's in the Torah, right? So you can,
3649400	3655160	that's considered, you didn't prepare that before the Sabbath. Also, it's threshing or harvesting,
3655160	3660600	which is forbidden on the Sabbath. So they, the scroll people back in the days of the teacher
3661400	3667240	in the time when these things were written, the sectarian scrolls, they would just be appalled
3668040	3675000	that the disciples of Jesus are harvesting barley and popping the grain in their mouth when
3675000	3681800	they're famished. And if you remember, the response of Jesus was not like, oh, well, sorry, we broke
3681800	3686920	the law, but it was basically like, well, you know, the Sabbath's made for people, not people for the
3686920	3693800	Sabbath. So the idea of being humane to an animal or taking care of human need on the Sabbath,
3694760	3700280	which the Pharisees also taught, and they made certain allowances to allow you to keep the
3700280	3706280	Sabbath in less of a strict way. Whereas the carites later did not. And I'd have to check with
3706280	3713160	Namia Gordon to see today how they're defining the dwelling. Because if you can't go out of your
3713160	3718200	house during the Sabbath, you're dwelling. Does that mean your literal house you live in,
3718200	3725000	like the rooms you inhabit or apartment? Or does it mean your town? Or does it mean your city?
3725000	3730040	If you're in a large city, all these things are interpreted differently by Judaism over the years.
3730040	3737640	Some of you might know there is around the city of Jerusalem today a wire or thread like
3738120	3745160	element upon poles all the way around the city. And that the rabbis define Jerusalem as the dwelling
3745160	3749720	of the people in Jerusalem. So you don't go out of your dwelling, meaning you don't go out of the
3749720	3754280	city of Jerusalem, but you can go anywhere in the city of Jerusalem. This group would have been
3754280	3761000	horrified at any of those kinds of interpretations. I think they would have been very upset with Jesus
3761960	3767960	for any number of things that he did. So I don't think Jesus is part of this.
3768680	3774040	Some people think John the Baptist is and they try to make him really rigid and conservative.
3774040	3779400	But you know, the only traditions we have of John the Baptist, he's actually pretty accommodating.
3779400	3786760	He talks to Roman soldiers. He talks to tax collectors and blesses them and says,
3786760	3791960	you're fine. You can come in the movement. Of course, everybody has to repent. But I mean,
3791960	3799640	he seems like he's more accepting. I would put John the Baptist Jesus and James sort of on a plane,
3800360	3804920	even though they might have had some differences. So this is an election on the Jesus movement,
3804920	3811640	but because it's another parallel second temple, apocalyptic movement of the time I want to mention
3812600	3816920	it. So they're taking both movements, the Jesus movement and the Dead Sea Scroll movement.
3817800	3823480	They're reading these texts and we have to wonder what version. We know the Qumran group
3823480	3830440	was reading the version that we just studied, but is there evidence that in the New Testament that
3830440	3837160	some of the texts that were being quoted were actually, they're quoting more the Septuagint or
3837160	3843320	the Dead Sea Scrolls and the answer is yes. That's why some of the readings differ quite a bit,
3843320	3847800	because they're quoting a different version. They're not just changing the Bible they're using.
3847800	3851000	I guess you could say a different text of that particular book of the Bible.
3852040	3858120	So I hope that has been interesting to you. You'll get the Dead Sea Scroll Bible, delve into it.
3858120	3865000	I'm particularly excited about what Ross will be able to uncover in looking at all the scrolls of
3865000	3871720	Deuteronomy from the Dead Sea's collection and comparing them to the Shapira Scroll.
3872360	3879320	As I said earlier, that could be quite telling because Shapira would not have known
3880120	3885640	these versions of Deuteronomy in Hebrew if there are parallels and we've already seen a couple.
3886440	3892440	Then how would he have forged the document and made up readings that are later going to be discovered
3892520	3899640	in 1947 in caves? But remember he found the Moses Scroll in a cave wrapped in land with
3899640	3907640	the sticky residue around it. It sounds kind of like the discovery of the Qumran Scrolls.
3908360	3914680	So some of you are going on the trip with us in October and we'll do other trips as well in the
3914680	3919720	future if you can't make this one. But one of the things we're going to do is stay in the desert
3919720	3925160	for three nights I think and we're going to visit Qumran and we're going to visit Masada and we're
3925160	3932360	going to walk around these caves and it's going to be very exciting. Dead Sea Scroll news breaks
3932360	3937640	all the time like that Esther Scroll discovery that I just told you about. During the time I've
3937640	3943400	been teaching my Dead Sea Scroll class this semester we've had several major news stories on the
3943400	3951320	Dead Sea Scrolls break. So it's really an exciting field to be in. I'm really really interested
3951320	3957000	and fascinated with the Dead Sea Scrolls. I've studied them for years and I hope this will
3957000	3973240	encourage all of you to study them too. So Shabbat Shalom and wish you all well.
3973400	3985240	Thank you.
