1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
to get started here. Hope everybody can see and hear okay. So today I'm going to

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,360
talk to you about the Dead Sea Scrolls Bible and I'm using Bible and scare

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,760
quotes because obviously nobody was carrying around the Dead Sea, you know,

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,600
a printed Bible or even a handwritten Bible. But the books that are part of the

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:34,040
Hebrew Bible, they are represented in the Dead Sea Scroll Library to some extent

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,880
and that's what I want to talk about. Just as I start I want to introduce you

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,560
to some resources because I'm teaching a course this semester on the Dead Sea Scrolls

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,600
so I have everything right here and I know many of you are very interested. I

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,400
would say the number one book that I would recommend, I got to figure out how

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,920
to show this at the right angle without the glare, but it's Vander Cam and Flint.

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,480
I think you all can see that. The meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls, you can get it in

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,360
paperback. Highly recommended. This is the book on the scrolls. You really need

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,320
it to be able to talk much about the scrolls or all of their background and

14
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,320
to know the history and what they contain and who wrote them and how to date them

15
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,320
and all the theories, all the interpretations. That book is a book

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,320
that I always use and with all of my students. And as far as reading the

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,800
scrolls, which is also important, I always tell the story in the 90s when I was

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,920
lecturing here in Charlotte, North Carolina. When the scrolls were on exhibit

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,280
here in Charlotte and there was this huge exhibit and we had a lecture at the

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,920
Jewish Community Center. It was standing room only. It was unbelievable. They had

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,280
to get chairs and open up the side. Everybody's interested in the scrolls

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,120
and they had just been released through Robert Eisenman's efforts and Herschel

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,680
Shanks at Bar Magazine and others. I was somewhat involved in that. And after my

24
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,880
lecture, a woman came up and she said, oh Dr. Tabor, I'm so glad we have the

25
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,880
scrolls finally because about probably a third of the scrolls had not been

26
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,080
released until the 90s. So there was a big campaign. Some of you will remember

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,280
Herschel Shanks really spearheaded it in Bar Magazine, but Robert Eisenman I think

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,360
was really behind the scenes. And he's the one who actually got the photographs

29
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,840
and then had them published. And then they were all public finally. So this is

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,560
the complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English. It's a penguin paperback. The editor is

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,880
Geza Vermish, V-E-R-M-E-S. I guess his name is not even on the front, but it's on

32
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,520
the side I think. Not even the side. So he didn't write them. He doesn't want his

33
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,080
name on, but he's the translator and it's a great addition. It has over a hundred

34
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,520
pages of introductory material and then it also has lots of commentary and

35
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,560
helps as you read the scrolls. But the main thing is it has the scrolls in

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,880
English. So I really want to recommend this. So this woman was saying, oh I love

37
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,840
the scrolls and I had a version of an earlier version of this and I said, oh

38
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,040
have you read them yet? And she goes, oh no I haven't read them, but I just love

39
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,920
that we have them. So I think a lot of people are in that situation where we

40
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,720
talk about, oh finally we got the scrolls, but then you don't even read them.

41
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,080
Maybe kind of like the Bible with people who love that we have the Bible, but

42
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,720
they've never read it. Then I want to mention this is the year of the scrolls

43
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:02,720
because here's a life magazine, the Dead Sea Scrolls, after 75 years. The race to

44
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,240
solve an ancient mystery. You can get this at newsstands, grocery stores and so

45
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,600
forth. I also, I ordered it from Amazon and then this one is very nice. This is

46
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,920
the Dead Sea Scrolls. The subtitle is 75 years since their historic discovery.

47
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,760
Both of these are worth having, but I would want the VanderKam and Flant the

48
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,960
book. Most of the people listening to me in this audience I think are really good

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,280
students and they like to study. Now that's in English. If you study Hebrew,

50
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,240
which I know some of you do, you want to get it. It'll have a different cover.

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,480
This is an edition I've had for several years. I think it's red now. Anyway, it's

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,560
called the Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition. Be careful if you order it because

53
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,600
there's a study edition that is just English, but as you see when I open this

54
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,880
up, get a nice page of Hebrew here to show you. You can see you've got the

55
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,960
English on one side and the Hebrew on the other. This is Martinez, the editor.

56
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,520
Florentino Martinez. He's a good friend of mine. I see him at conferences. He works

57
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,840
in Spain, in Madrid, I think, or maybe Barcelona. Yeah, I think Barcelona, but

58
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:28,840
he's provided this wonderful study edition for students who want to read

59
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,960
the Dead Sea Scrolls with Hebrew as well. Let me also mention that's

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,720
introductory that I've recently put on my YouTube channel, which is, let's see,

61
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,400
James Tabor videos. You can find it on YouTube. I've been putting up a lot of

62
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,800
things. I've put up some things even this morning, but I've got three recent

63
00:05:51,800 --> 00:06:00,040
lectures that I did at the Biblical Archaeology Seminar over the years. One is

64
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:08,240
called, let's see, I wrote this down, the exact names. Who wrote the Scrolls? So you

65
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,480
can look at that. Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return. And I didn't tend that title to

66
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,280
be kind of shocking or provocative, but at the end, I say, you know, one thing

67
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,600
about all Messiahs, they've all died and they haven't come back yet. And I was

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,640
mainly talking about the Teacher of Righteousness, who's the leader of the

69
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:35,200
Dead Sea Scroll community. And then a third video, the Dead Sea Scroll calendar.

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,680
You know, there are several Jewish calendars that are being used in the

71
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,400
time of the Second Temple period for Christians the time of Jesus. There are

72
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,720
three different main calendars, a lunar calendar, a solar lunar calendar, a

73
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,440
solar calendar, and then it has to do with how you calculate the months and so

74
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:04,800
forth. And I've got those up. And if you go to my blog, JamesTabor.com, I upload

75
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,640
some documents. Here's a sample. These are printed documents that you can look

76
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,640
at that go with the videos. So that's enough for education. The only other

77
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,880
thing I would mention is the Wikipedia article. I know professors are not

78
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,040
supposed to recommend Wikipedia to their students, but you know what, some of the

79
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,880
Wikipedia articles are just excellent. If you want to go into some controversial

80
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,840
thing or political thing, they can be tough. And I know religion can be

81
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,360
controversial, but something like the Dead Sea Scrolls, the videos are, I mean,

82
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,760
the articles in Wikipedia are fabulous. They really are. Very, very complete

83
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,360
article. So that would be a good thing to read, too. You can print it out and

84
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,280
study it if you don't know about the, much about the Dead Sea Scrolls. So I

85
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:01,320
hope this lecture or lesson or class, I guess I could call it, would encourage

86
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,280
you to delve into the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves. They certainly are the

87
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:13,120
greatest archaeological discovery in our time. And I want to mention one

88
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,360
other book. I think I have it here somewhere. Let's see. I thought I laid it

89
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,200
down. It's, I was going to show Ross's book. Yeah, I got it. Because this is

90
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,400
about a Dead Sea Scroll as well. The question is, was it a forgery or was it

91
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,800
authentic or a genuine scroll? And then when would it date? So if you haven't

92
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,680
heard about this, it was featured the other night on Coast to Coast. It's

93
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:45,760
really getting out there and Ross has got a whole slate of interviews set up as a

94
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,840
result of this book. So you should, most of you, I think many of you in this

95
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,840
audience have heard of this, but in the back, there's a translation of what

96
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,560
might be maybe the oldest and most important of all the Dead Sea Scrolls.

97
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,320
We haven't been able to find it because it's disappeared, but Ross does a good

98
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,480
transcription and translation of it. And I want to include that as well as part

99
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,640
of the Dead Sea Scrolls. To read more about that, just go to themosiscroll.com,

100
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,960
which is Ross's website. You can order the book through several means,

101
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,160
including Amazon. Amazon, I think, is the publisher of it, or not the publisher,

102
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,840
but the vehicle through which it was published. And also a blog where Nichols

103
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,120
has put up a whole lot of entries about the scroll and everything about it. And

104
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,680
in the last issue of Bar Magazine, I wrote an article with Edan Dershowitz,

105
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,120
who's also working with us on the Moses Scroll, arguing that it is very likely

106
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,680
authentic, that it's an authentic Dead Sea Scroll. But that's not what I'm talking

107
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,560
about today. So all of that is plummeting. So what are the Dead Sea Scrolls? We've

108
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,320
got 15,000 manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts. That's huge, representing

109
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,800
probably 600 different works or books. And yet some of the books that are

110
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,480
represented might just have a teeny piece or two that you could fit on just one

111
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,880
page and just a fragment. And some of the fragments are the size of like a

112
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,720
matchbook cover or even a thumbnail with only a couple of letters. So when we say

113
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,520
15,000 fragments, don't get too excited like you're going to have complete

114
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,640
copies of things. However, there are some complete copies of some of the scrolls.

115
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,200
They were mostly found in Cave 1 and then Cave 11 and then the Copper Scroll in

116
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,640
Cave 3. And Cave 1 was just a treasure because you had something called the

117
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,800
Community Rule, which is the charter of the group that wrote the scrolls or wrote

118
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,960
the sectarian scrolls. I'll explain that in a minute as to what these 600 books

119
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,800
are. Books that they wrote about their own group and their own movement kind of

120
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,440
like the Christians have the New Testament as their writings. So the Dead Sea

121
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:21,680
Scroll group had their own writings. And another one is the Thanksgiving Hymns,

122
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,040
which some of which were written by the teacher, their leader, we think, like he

123
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,480
uses the first person. We think he actually wrote these. So we've got that

124
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,160
from Cave 1. You've got as well the War Scroll from Cave 1 and a number of other

125
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:45,000
scrolls that are very complete. So if you break down the scrolls, about 30% of

126
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
them are written by the group. We call them the sectarian scrolls. These are the

127
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,040
scrolls where the group is talking about how they were formed and what they're

128
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,440
all about and what their vision of things is and what their history is and so

129
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,400
forth. So that's like almost a third are written by the group. And those are the

130
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:13,000
ones I specialize in. And then there's another 30% that are copies of texts that

131
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,400
they didn't write, but texts that are not the Hebrew Bible, but books that you

132
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,680
would recognize the names of, even if you haven't read them, like Jubilees, the

133
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,040
Book of Jubilees. They love the Book of Jubilees. It fits their solar calendar

134
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:34,160
that they used. And Enoch, not all of Enoch because Enoch is an Ethiopic, the

135
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,320
complete thing that we now have, but they had of the five parts of Enoch, they

136
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,720
had four of them and they did use them. And in fact, some of the Aramaic Enoch

137
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,880
texts are the oldest copies of Enoch that we have. And Enoch is quoted in

138
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,760
the New Testament in the Book of Jude. And there are a lot of other references

139
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,080
in the New Testament, just allusions to some of the language of the Book of

140
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:07,600
Enoch. So people in the Second Temple period from, let's say, about the Maccabees

141
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,120
down through Bar Kokba, or down through the destruction of Jerusalem and on to

142
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:20,560
Bar Kokba, 1st century CE, they're making use of these books and using them

143
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,440
all during that period. And then what we want to do today, 40% of the Dead Sea

144
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,000
Scrolls are copies of books of the Hebrew Bible. So I want to introduce you to a

145
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,520
book if you don't know it. I highly, highly recommend this book. I'm going to

146
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,760
read you the blurb on it in just a minute, but I want you to be able to see it

147
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,440
or get a screenshot of it. The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible, the oldest known Bible

148
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:57,840
translated for the first time into English. And the authors are Abeg, Flint, and

149
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:05,960
Ulrich. And it's really an amazing production. So what is this? Of those 40% of

150
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:14,480
the Dead Sea Scrolls, of the 1500 fragments, 600 volumes, the ones that

151
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,160
are copies of the Bible are in this book. So you actually have the Dead Sea Scroll

152
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,640
Bible. What it says at the top, over a thousand years older than any previously

153
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,800
discovered biblical manuscripts with material never before published or

154
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,600
translated, including hundreds of new and different readings and several lost

155
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:47,360
Psalms that actually could conceivably go into the book of Psalms. There's a Psalm

156
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,600
151, for example, that the Oxford Annotated RSV actually includes as well as

157
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,480
the new Oxford RSV. So highly recommend this book, because this is what I'm

158
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:07,240
going to talk from today. So who wrote the scrolls just before we start? Who is

159
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,240
this group so that we know something about them? I could give a complete

160
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,680
lecture on that, and I did. I mentioned I have a lecture on YouTube, and you can

161
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,840
find it on YouTube and listen to it with a lot of supplementary material on my

162
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:26,040
blog that goes with it. But usually people say, oh, the S-scenes wrote the

163
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,160
scrolls. The Dead Sea Scroll group are the S-scenes. Well, obviously they didn't

164
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,880
write all the scrolls, because you've got books like Jubilee's and Enoch that they

165
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,720
didn't write, and you've got the Hebrew Bible, which they didn't write. But that

166
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,960
30% is written by the group, and some of those even by the teacher himself. And so

167
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:53,240
we could talk about scrolls that they wrote and who they were. I don't think

168
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,200
the word S-scene is very helpful. I think the group that wrote the scrolls is

169
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:04,840
described by Josephus as the S-scenes. So if you go to book two of the Jewish

170
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,280
war, you can read his long description of the S-scenes. And he's very positive

171
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,560
about them. But remember, he's writing for the impervest patient. He's living in

172
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Rome. It's around 75 CE after the destruction of Jerusalem. And he wants to

173
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,520
talk about the traditions of the Jewish people and the schools, philosophical

174
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,440
schools, as the way he describes them. Pharisees, Sadducees, and S-scenes. And so

175
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,080
he presents them in Hellenistic guard. And also he presents them in ways that the

176
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:49,040
emperor would not find objectionable. Now that we have the scrolls, you can call

177
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,240
them S-scenes if you want, but don't go to Josephus for your definition of S-scenes

178
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,440
because he makes them kind of quietists and pacifists and they're a secluded

179
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,600
group. They sound a lot like the Pythagoreans. And then of course he makes

180
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:13,120
the Pharisees sound like Epicureans. And he makes, I'm sorry, the Sadducees. And

181
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,400
then the Pharisees he would make, he would describe in ways that would remind

182
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,680
you of the Platonists, or particularly the Stoics probably. So you see what he's

183
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,640
doing. So to understand the Dead Sea Scroll group, again, it's better to read

184
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,640
their own self-description. And what they, what we come up with, if you read the

185
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,840
Dead Sea Scrolls, the books that they wrote, I would describe them like this.

186
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:47,640
You ready? An apocalyptic, messianic, new covenant group, baptizing, you have to

187
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,560
be baptized, and I'm using, it's a mikvah, it's Jewish mikvah, but probably in

188
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:58,200
a running stream like the Jordan River, or the Dead Sea. You could presumably be

189
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,080
baptized in the Dead Sea because you probably want to hold your eyes really

190
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,000
tight when you go under, but you could do that. And maybe they did baptize in the

191
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,400
Dead Sea. So apocalyptic, messianic, new covenant. They claimed that they were the

192
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,760
people of the new covenant. They were, God has established the new covenant. They

193
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:24,560
were the ones separatists, communal living, and preparing the way in the desert, the

194
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:31,120
Aravah, Isaiah 40, verse three. Just as the New Testament opens in the Gospel of

195
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:40,000
Mark, with John the baptizer out in the desert, along the Jordan Valley, preaching

196
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,360
and baptizing and people and people say, who are you? And he says, I'm the voice of

197
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,080
one calling in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord. So when I say they're

198
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,480
people of the way, that might remind you of something in the Book of Acts, the

199
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,080
New Testament Book of Acts, because they also pick up the same language. So people

200
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,160
of the way means people of the desert way, people that are following the Torah,

201
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,640
according to the interpretations of this group, and what we call halakha or

202
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:19,920
interpretations of Torah. So whether you call them messians or not, basically go to

203
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,080
the scrolls for a definition. Now, none of those terms would describe the Pharisees.

204
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,080
None of those terms would describe the Sadducees. And yet those terms do describe

205
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,960
this group. And I would say every one of those terms also describes the Jesus

206
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,400
movement. So when the scrolls were discovered, people were very, very

207
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,440
excited and keen, but also a little nervous, because it's like we found an

208
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,560
apocalyptic messianic group thinking they're preparing the way in the

209
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,920
wilderness, saying they're people of the New Covenant, communal living, separatists,

210
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,440
baptizing into the group and so forth. They're doing all of these things. And

211
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,680
basically my screen went out. I'm going to put it back. It doesn't matter, but I'd

212
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,160
rather not talk to a blank screen. So give me just a second. I need to probably,

213
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:21,440
sorry about that. This is probably going to happen over and over. So anyway,

214
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,600
where was I? I was talking about the, oh, how people were maybe a bit nervous

215
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,440
because they would think, well, you know, is this like a precursor of the

216
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:43,360
Jesus movement? Or, you know, did the Jesus move a kind of copy or did they

217
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,280
come from this group or whatever? But we're not going to talk about that

218
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,160
today. So, but it is a good topic to talk about the relationship of the

219
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,680
Jesus movement, the John the Baptist movement, followers of James the

220
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,440
brother of Jesus, how they might have related to the Dead Sea Scroll group.

221
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,160
I've written a lot about that in my books, such as the Jesus Diocese. Now, as

222
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,560
far as the 40% of the scrolls that do have the Hebrew copies of the Hebrew

223
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:18,400
Bible, there's one book supposedly missing. And it just so happens that it's

224
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,080
not missing anymore. Some of you who want to look this up, you could paste the

225
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:29,960
URL maybe in one of the chats on YouTube or Facebook. But recently, just

226
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:36,640
recently, the book of Esther has been identified as fragments of the Dead Sea

227
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,280
Scrolls. So if you've ever heard, and you still read this, if you look it up,

228
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,680
that they had copies of all the books of the Hebrew Bible, except for Esther in

229
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,760
the Amaya. Well, Esther has now been located. And it's an article at the

230
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:59,040
website, thetora.com. So if you go to thetora.com, it's called newly deciphered

231
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,680
Comron Scroll revealed to be Esther. So it's really easy to find. It's by, let's

232
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:10,120
see, Rabbi Asher Tovlev. And it's a really exciting story because you know why

233
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,560
they hadn't identified Esther? Because somebody spilled some wine on it. And it

234
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,840
was stained and you couldn't make it out. But now through photographic means,

235
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:26,360
they've been able to make it out, which is really amazing. So what we want to do

236
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,520
today, I'm going to switch on my reading light here, where I can see better what

237
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:39,920
I want to do is I want to take this Dead Sea Scroll Bible. And I want to pick five

238
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:48,040
different, let's see, is it five or six, one, two, three, actually, it's four

239
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,040
different references, but some of them have more than one. I'm going to pick four

240
00:22:52,040 --> 00:23:00,480
or five places within here. You see, I've got a mark here, where the Hebrew Bible

241
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,440
that we have, the Masoretic text differs from the readings that are in the

242
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,840
scrolls. And that's what I want to talk about. Now, here's the problem with that.

243
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,480
Many people talk about the Hebrew Bible. I've got a Hebrew Bible right here. This

244
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,440
is the standard scholarly edition of the Hebrew Bible. It's called the BHS,

245
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,280
Biblia Hebraica Stuttgart, Densia Stuttgart, the German. It's where it was put

246
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:32,840
out, put in Latin. It's referred to as the BHS. And you can see here on the page,

247
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,440
if I put it really close at the bottom, that you've got all of these variant

248
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,200
readings. So even though people talk about, I want to go by the Masoretic text,

249
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,480
you have to realize even the Masoretic text, the traditional Hebrew text, like

250
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:57,400
some of you use the Koran Bible, K-O-R-E-N. It's a standardized text that's

251
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,440
been standardized by the rabbis of hundreds of years ago, but there are

252
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:10,680
variants. And many of you probably remember or know Bart Ehrman, who is the

253
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,920
New Testament scholar. And he was trained at Princeton. And when he learned as a

254
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,560
student that there are all these variants in the New Testament, it really

255
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,440
disturbed him because he was raised as a very conservative Christian and

256
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:30,840
whatever the traditional Byzantine texts of the Greek New Testament said, he

257
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,400
just felt it had to be perfect without any kind of mistakes or variants. And

258
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,120
then when he began going to graduate school and finding out that there are

259
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,520
literally hundreds of variants, now what you'll often hear is, well, the Masoretic

260
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,440
text, it doesn't have any variants. You know how people count the letters and

261
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,520
they do these Bible code things. But all you need is one variant and the whole

262
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,120
Bible code is thrown off, right? Because all the letters would then shift even by

263
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,800
one letter. And so I'm not too fond of the Bible code concept because I happen

264
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,480
to know that the text you're searching is just one of several copies of the

265
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:14,800
Masoretic text. The one that is used by in the BHS is the Leningrad Codex. It's

266
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,800
the oldest copy of the Hebrew Bible Masoretic text, as we call it. The

267
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,720
traditional texts is maybe another way to refer to it. That's complete. There's

268
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,440
the Aleppo Codex that's a little bit older, but part of it was destroyed by

269
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,040
actually anti-Semites who raided the place and tried to burn the scroll. But

270
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,040
fortunately, most of it did survive and it's on display in Jerusalem. If you've

271
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,480
been there and seen that, it's in the shrine of the book there in Jerusalem. So

272
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,880
anyway, when you talk about the Hebrew Bible, here's what we've got. We've got

273
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,080
the Masoretic text, but it does have variations. At the bottom of every page,

274
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,400
you can see these other readings of other copies of it because copyists make

275
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:10,240
mistakes and variations creep in over the centuries. We've also got what's

276
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:17,120
called the Septuagint, LXX. You'll see it abbreviated. That's a translation of

277
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:24,000
the Hebrew Bible that we think was made in the second century, DCE. And we do

278
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,640
have manuscripts of the Septuagint, quite a few that have survived. And it

279
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,240
doesn't always read the same as the Hebrew Bible either. So you've got other

280
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,400
versions. And then the Samaritan Pentateuch. Now that's only the five books of

281
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,400
Moses, but the Samaritan Pentateuch does differ in places with the Masoretic

282
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,200
texts. So that would be three different versions of the Torah, at least. And of

283
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,120
the Hebrew Bible in general, you would have two versions, the Masoretic texts

284
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,240
with its variants, as well as the Septuagint. And of course, the Septuagint

285
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,360
would have variants also. And then you add the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is not

286
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:10,960
complete because we don't have absolute copies of every single book of the

287
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,240
Hebrew Bible. But it is, in fact, another tradition. And sometimes the readings of

288
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,640
the Dead Sea Scrolls agree with this Septuagint. The first or second

289
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,240
example we're going to have today, we're going to consider today, actually agrees

290
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:36,160
with the Greek, not the Masoretic texts. And so scholars have been busy now for

291
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,080
75 years doing all of these comparisons and trying to figure it out. This

292
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,120
bothers some people. I hope it doesn't bother you who are listening. I don't

293
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,120
want it to bother you. Tell my students, I don't want it to bother them either.

294
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,680
Because what you don't want to do is trade one fundamentalism for another. Many

295
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:05,480
of, I was raised in a fairly conservative Christian tradition. And the

296
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,200
tradition I came out of, the Campbellite or Churches of Christ, they would have

297
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,240
said by and large, although they're probably liberalized a little here and

298
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,680
there over the years. But they would have said, you know, the Bible is inspired

299
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,360
and it's perfect and it has no mistakes. And they just don't like variations. And

300
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,480
yet there are variations. When I first took Greek, I've got my Greek New

301
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,120
Testament here. This is the Greek New Testament. And you can see it's very,

302
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,560
very similar. It's got all of those variations at the bottom of the Greek

303
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,360
text. So we shouldn't wish for something that we don't have. We have

304
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,400
different versions of the Hebrew Bible, different versions of the New

305
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,920
Testament, actually different versions of every single book from antiquity. This

306
00:28:51,920 --> 00:29:00,120
is actually a treasure of riches. We want that sort of thing because we want

307
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,120
all the possible information we can. Now, when the Dead Sea Scrolls were

308
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:13,520
discovered, Cave One, there were 10 jars and only one had scrolls. And Cave

309
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,240
One in the jar with the seven scrolls that were in that jar was a complete copy

310
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,320
of the book of Isaiah. I've got a book over here with the original colored

311
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,320
pictures that Trevor did, the scholar Trevor living in Jerusalem at the

312
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,760
Albright. Beautiful pictures that are still used today in color. So everybody

313
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,680
wondered, well, if you compared the Isaiah of the Masoretic text, the

314
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,960
traditional Hebrew text, with the Dead Sea Scroll copy, because the Leningrad

315
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:51,920
Codex, the oldest copy of the Masoretic text, is about a thousand AD CE. And the

316
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:58,920
Dead Sea Scroll Isaiah is probably 150-200 BCE. So you've jumped back over a

317
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:05,600
thousand years, probably 1200 years. It's hard to date exactly. But in that

318
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,640
amazing, so you want to kind of compare it. It is our book of Isaiah. It has the

319
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,320
same number of sections and chapters and it essentially has the same contents. But

320
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,880
there are thousands of variations where it reads differently. And sometimes those

321
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:25,640
variations agree with the Septuagint or the Samaritan penitent. Now usually,

322
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,120
people will say, well, it was essentially the same. And that's true. And it's also

323
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,920
false. But it probably depends on what you mean essentially. It is

324
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,520
essentially the same. But essentially the same doesn't mean you shouldn't notice

325
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,200
the differences, as I'm going to show you today, because the differences could be

326
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,720
significant. And get ready for this. Some of the readings in the Dead Sea Scrolls

327
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:57,400
parallel the Moses Scroll. And Ross Nichols is currently working on a project to

328
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,400
compare all the readings of the Dead Sea Scrolls of Deuteronomy. And did you know

329
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,040
some of those are Paleo-Ebru, actually written in the ancient script, with the

330
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,000
Moses Scroll transcript that we have. And that's going to be a pretty long

331
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,440
project. But he has begun that project. So that's going to be pretty interesting.

332
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,360
And I'm going to show you one of those today, one of the parallels, where the

333
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,160
Moses Scroll reads the same as one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is very,

334
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,560
very interesting. It sounds like maybe it's not a forgery, because I don't

335
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,160
think Moses Shapiro had copies of the Comron Scrolls, at least, that were

336
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:47,040
found in 1947. I would encourage you all to, when you think about, you know,

337
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,360
fundamentalism and the Hebrew faith, and what it is to follow the God of Israel,

338
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,600
and so forth, to have an open view that there are pillars of the faith, the

339
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,240
call of Abraham, the Torah given at Sinai, the prophets, and so forth, that

340
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,240
seem to be bedrock for all forms of Judaism and Hebrew faith, even Gentiles

341
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,680
that adhere to the Hebrew faith. But essentially, you know, you don't have

342
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,680
to have a set view of what the text has to be, if it doesn't conform to what

343
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,360
we're discovering or what the facts are. And I think most of the people in

344
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,080
these particular audiences of the United Israel World Union, which is sponsoring

345
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:42,200
this talk that I'm presenting here, this class, I think most of the people who

346
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:47,120
follow Ross Nichols' teaching week by week, he teaches on this channel every

347
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:53,080
week at the same time. And you're used to this, like you want all the

348
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,880
scholarly information possible, and I'm glad that that's the case. It's not a

349
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:04,520
threat, it's a treasure trove of riches to delve into these things. So let's

350
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:11,520
start with Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 12. If you have a Hebrew Bible, whatever

351
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,960
translation doesn't matter, because it'll probably be the Messeridic text, go

352
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,320
ahead and turn to Deuteronomy 5, and you will then have the standard version of

353
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,840
the traditional Hebrew text. So it's on page 154 in this Dead Sea Scrolls Bible.

354
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:36,920
If you have the book, you can follow along with the book. And it has to do

355
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,000
with the 10 words. One of the ways of describing people say, what is United

356
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,640
Israel World Union? It was formed in 1944 by a Jewish correspondent and Bible

357
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:56,840
student. His name was David Horowitz. And David Horowitz coined the idea of

358
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,600
decalogue faith for all nations. And we like that very much. The idea would be

359
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:09,040
the essential faith around the 10 words, the 10 commandments, should be for the

360
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,880
whole world, not simply for Jews. And so the decalogue faith. And as you know, one

361
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:21,760
command of the decalogue faith is, in fact, the Sabbath, to keep the Sabbath.

362
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,760
Today is the Sabbath. So either remember or observe the Sabbath day. So verse 12

363
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,800
does in fact say, observe the Sabbath day, keep it holy, as the Lord commanded you.

364
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,520
And it's actually the divine name, Y-H-V-H, which they write in Paleo Hebrew, by

365
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,200
the way. Six days you will labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a

366
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:50,320
Sabbath to the Lord your God, and so forth. You should do no work. Now in Deuteronomy,

367
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:57,120
you have this idea that the reason you do this is because God brought the people

368
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:04,040
of Israel out of Egypt. And that's also in Exodus 31 as the reason. But as you

369
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:11,080
know, there's also the idea that God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath. For in

370
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,880
six days the Lord made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is in them, and

371
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,840
rested the seventh day, so that the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.

372
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:30,080
Now that's not in the Masoretic text at this spot of Deuteronomy. It is in the

373
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,440
Moses scroll. So there's the example. And there's one of this, the Dead Sea Scroll

374
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,160
copy. It's actually 4Q Deuteronomy. It's called from Cave 4. It's a fragment of

375
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,560
Deuteronomy. It has the idea that the Sabbath goes back to the creation. So

376
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,440
it's connecting to Genesis 1 and 2 in the same way that the Moses scroll does.

377
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,280
And if you compare Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, you can see the two

378
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,600
versions. So this could be seen as an attempt to harmonize, like let's give

379
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:12,920
both reasons. But on the other hand, it could also be seen as maybe a tradition

380
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,040
that the Dead Sea Scroll group is preserving that would be older than

381
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,840
the later tradition that we know as the Masoretic text. So that's the first

382
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:29,160
example I want to give. The second one is a couple of verses. It's in what's

383
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:36,120
called the Song of Moses, and it's Deuteronomy 32. So if you go to Deuteronomy

384
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:46,680
32, and you can see down at verse 8, a very well-known verse that says,

385
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,920
when the Most High separated or gave to the nations their inheritance, he

386
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,960
separated humankind, and he set the bounds of the peoples according to the

387
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,560
number of the children of Israel. That's the Masoretic text. That's probably what

388
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,520
the translation says that most of you are reading, depending on which one you're

389
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:19,240
reading. However, in the Dead Sea Scroll portion, it says, according to the

390
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,680
sons of Elohim, the children of God, and it uses Elohim. Isn't that interesting?

391
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,640
Because Elohim is also used in the Moses Scroll, as you know. Many of you know

392
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:39,400
read about it or read the book. So the sons of Elohim. Now the sons of Elohim

393
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,040
could be considered the children of Israel, I suppose, but because of another

394
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,200
verse in this same chapter, or in the same song, if you go down to verse 43,

395
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:57,640
it's pretty clear that it's talking about the sons of God, or the Bene Elohim,

396
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,520
as it is in Hebrew, that are the hosts that surround God.

397
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,640
Did I say Psalm 82? Remember, it talks about how God sits and is surrounded

398
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:19,080
by all of these gods, or Elohim. So here's what verse 43 says in the Dead Sea Scrolls,

399
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:25,960
and this would be a 4-Q Deuteronomy also. K-4, the copy of Deuteronomy.

400
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,520
It reads like this. This is going to be different from what you have if you have the

401
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:37,880
Maseridic text. Rejoice, O heavens, together with him, and bow down to him all you gods,

402
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,520
for he will avenge the blood of his sons, his children, his

403
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:50,280
banim, and will render vengeance to his enemies, and will recompense those who hate him, and will

404
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:57,960
atone for the land of his people. And so it's actually talking about bow down to him you gods,

405
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:06,840
this reference to you gods, or in the Sattuagen even has sons of God, which seems again to be these

406
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,760
ruling powers that are spoken of a number of times in the Hebrew Bible. I think I have this

407
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:22,440
book handy, let's see. If I do have it handy, I recommend. This includes the New Testament too,

408
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,000
but the part on the Hebrew Bible is really good. Michael Heiser's book, The Unseen Realm.

409
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,960
Michael has an article online. You can look it up called The Bene Elohim, The Sons of God. It's

410
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,760
really good. He did his dissertation on that subject, and he's a real expert on it. It's

411
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:45,400
something to really study. So here you have a text in the Dead Sea Scrolls that is talking about the

412
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:54,120
Bene Elohim as seemingly parallel to Psalm 82, meaning these heavenly beings, not simply talking

413
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:59,960
about the flesh and blood Israelites. So I think that's pretty interesting as we go along.

414
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:09,160
Now, Isaiah 53. Isaiah 53 is really, really interesting. It was in Cave One in that jar

415
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:15,000
that had the seven scrolls, and it's a complete copy of Isaiah. Actually, I'm going to pull up

416
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:25,080
my copy here to show you because it's so beautiful. I want you to see, and I think this is the color

417
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,720
one. Yep, this is the color one. So you can buy this. These are the photographs that Trevor

418
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:38,520
originally made. You've got the black and white in the color. Absolutely gorgeous photographs. If

419
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:44,520
you've been to Israel and been to the shrine of the book, there's a replica of this scroll wrapped

420
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:52,200
around the central scroll display area where you can see it almost like it's wrapped around

421
00:40:52,200 --> 00:41:00,040
like a Torah scroll. And Israelis have fun taking their kids to see the Dead Sea Scrolls because

422
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:06,120
any kid in Israel can just read Isaiah right off the page, even though it's in this Herodian script.

423
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:13,400
So it's pretty amazing how things have not changed. However, does Isaiah have changes?

424
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:19,160
Often, I remember when I first studied this, I was in a more conservative school, Abilene

425
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,200
Christian University, and there was more an emphasis on, you know, it's basically the same

426
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,240
as the Masoretic Text, and it is. It's basically the same as the Masoretic Text, and it's quite

427
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:35,800
remarkable that Isaiah is preserved to that degree. However, it does have interesting readings that are

428
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:43,640
different. A few of them are pretty minor, but I'm going to mention a few of them, but some of them

429
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:51,480
are quite strikingly different. So Isaiah 53, which is the famous Suffering Servant Hymn of Isaiah,

430
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:58,280
one of the four Suffering Servant Hymns, as they're traditionally known by scholars,

431
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:04,760
Hebrew Bible scholars. And I'm going to read verse three. He was despised and rejected by others,

432
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:13,320
and, I'm reading the Dead Sea version, and a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering,

433
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:25,160
and like one from whom people hide their faces, and we despised him and did not value him.

434
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:33,720
So the footnote explains that he was despised is the Masoretic Text. Remember, he was despised and

435
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:40,280
rejected. Many people have that memorized. Notice this says we despised him, and so in the Dead Sea

436
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:47,560
Squall version of Isaiah, it's in the first person that we, and that would go with verse four.

437
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:55,240
Surely he has borne our sufferings and so forth. If you go on down to, let's see, verse eight,

438
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,520
in the middle of verse, just the last part of verse eight, for he was cut off from the land of

439
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:12,520
the living. He was stricken for the transgression of my people, and it's actually his people.

440
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,720
Instead of Ami, it's Ammo, his people in the Dead Sea version. Does that make a difference? Does

441
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,920
that make a difference? Well, you can write it down and study it and think about it. You have to

442
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,600
read the whole chapter and think about it. But this is a version that has some parallels. And

443
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:37,960
remember, some of these are also, these readings that we're going over today, are also paralleled in

444
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,800
the Septuagint, the Greek translation, meaning that the Greek translators were also using a copy of

445
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,760
the Hebrew Bible that would be closer to what we have in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Verse nine says,

446
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:59,800
And they made his grave with the wicked. I believe the Masoretic text has he made, doesn't it? Let's

447
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:07,560
see. He made maybe? Yeah. They made. So it's plural. They made his grave with the wicked,

448
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:14,280
and with rich people his tomb. And if you remember, the Masoretic text has this strange plural

449
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:22,120
with a rich man in his death's plural. And some people have really gotten off on that and talked

450
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:28,440
to try to apply it to Jesus and say, well, maybe he survived the cross and then died later. So he

451
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:35,080
has deaths, not death and all kinds of ideas people have come up with. But this just says,

452
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:44,520
with rich people was his tomb. As he was buried in a tomb, or this person's buried in a tomb,

453
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:50,120
I'm not talking about Jesus here, although he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth.

454
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:58,760
Yet the Lord, and this is Yodhe Vavhe Hashem, but the Lord was willing to crush him,

455
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:10,680
and he made him suffer. So I think, let's see, he made him suffer, MT. Right. That's,

456
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,480
I'm not sure that, I don't have the MT open, so I'm not sure that that's not so significant for us

457
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:24,680
right now. Now here's the one I think is most interesting, verse 11. You ready? Verse 11. When

458
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:30,920
I first studied the Dead Sea Scrolls, I did a number of interviews. I remember Zola Levitt.

459
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:36,600
Any of you remember Zola Levitt? Had that very popular TV program. He was very excited about

460
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:43,160
this reading of the scroll. Because in the Dead Sea copy of the scrolls, it says,

461
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:51,720
out of his suffering, his soul will see light. Out of his suffering, his soul will see light

462
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:58,200
and find satisfaction. The idea of his soul seeing light

463
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:06,120
is not in the Masoretic text. There's nothing like that. It just says he will see the suffering of

464
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:13,320
his soul. But to see light or his very, very diffidence, very clear in the scrolls, what that

465
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:20,760
would mean? It was interpreted probably by second temple groups that might have used a text like this

466
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:26,440
to maybe mean resurrection. Because toward the end, it talks about him

467
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:36,280
seeing his offspring and rejoicing and so forth and dividing the spoil. And so you could see how

468
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,720
the Dead Sea Scroll group would think that their teacher, who they felt fulfilled this, the teacher

469
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,640
of righteousness they called him, he was their leader, and they saw him as a kind of a new Moses.

470
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:55,320
But they would feel that basically that this person maybe is going to suffer and be buried,

471
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:02,360
but also see light. And I cover that in my lecture, Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return,

472
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,680
because they expected him to return and he simply didn't.

473
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,440
There's some other things. This book is nice because whenever there's a difference,

474
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:21,240
it puts it in italics. And otherwise, it's the Masoretic Text. So it's really easy to use. And

475
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:27,240
then you look down on the footnote and you see what the Masoretic Text had, what the Septuagint had,

476
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:33,640
and what the Samaritan Pentateuch had. So Isaiah 53 is interesting. There's some differences that

477
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:41,640
might be significant. Finally, and I think this one is really, really interesting, Malachi, the

478
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:51,560
last of the Hebrew prophets, the famous passage in chapter three that is quoted in the New Testament

479
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:59,000
and applied to John the Baptizer, I call him the Baptizer, Yocanon Hamat Ville, John the Dipper.

480
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:08,680
I'll read it to you in the scroll version. You ready? Therefore, behold, I send my messenger

481
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:15,640
and he will prepare the way before me and they will suddenly come to his temple, the Lord whom

482
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:23,720
you seek and the messenger of the covenant whom you desire. Behold, he himself comes, says Hashem

483
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,720
of hosts, the Lord of hosts, the Eternal of hosts, but who can endure them? They come,

484
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:36,600
meaning when they come is the idea. Now, did you notice any difference in what you probably have,

485
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:45,480
the Masoretic text? It looks like it's two figures, two messiahs. The Lord here is not the divine name

486
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,840
when the Lord comes to his temple. That's Adon, L-O-R-D, the Lord, the master, the Adon of the

487
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:59,320
earth, so to speak, could be a Messiah figure. So let me read it again. Therefore, I will send my

488
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:06,440
messenger, that's one figure, he will prepare the way before me and they will suddenly come to

489
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:13,960
his temple, the Lord whom you seek and the messenger of the covenant. This group believed in two

490
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:20,440
messiahs. They believed in a priestly messiah, this Dead Sea Scroll group, and a Davidic messiah.

491
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:28,520
So they believe that both messiahs were coming, and here you see two are talked about

492
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:35,880
in the Dead Sea Scroll version of Malachi. And then, excuse me, let me get a little drink of water.

493
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:45,400
Who can endure them when they come? Who can endure them when they come?

494
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:56,520
Which is original? I'm just tempted to think that the plural is the more original because we have

495
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:04,440
texts like Zachariah 6 that talks about the two messiahs. Earlier in Zachariah, with the two olive

496
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:12,520
branches and the lamp stand, there are the two sons of fresh oil, one on the right and one on the left.

497
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:19,160
And in Zachariah 6, you talk about the Davidic figure, the branch sitting on his throne,

498
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,640
and then a priest standing by his side. So when you read the Dead Sea Scrolls, they believe in the

499
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:34,040
coming of two messiahs. They talk about the coming of the messiahs of Israel and Aaron. Israel would

500
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:41,400
be the messiah of Israel, the Davidic ruler, the king, and the messiah of Aaron would be the priest.

501
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:49,240
So the Dead Sea Scroll group had three figures. I've written a lot about this. I've got articles

502
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:55,560
about it. I've got an article on my blog called 123 messiahs question mark. So you can look that up

503
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:02,440
jamestaber.com if you want to read more about that. But I'm thinking during the Second Temple period,

504
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:09,400
there were expectations for three figures. If you go by the scrolls, here are the figures.

505
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:16,040
A prophet like Moses, a kind of second Moses who would come, sort of middle figure. That would be

506
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:23,320
the lampstand figure who's the adorn of the whole earth, the Lord of the whole earth. And he's able

507
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:30,120
to inaugurate the new covenant. That was their view. And they believe that he had come, the teacher

508
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:36,920
of righteousness. They say things about him that are quite extravagant. For example, they say to

509
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:44,520
him, God has made known all the mysteries of the prophets, all the mysteries of the prophets. Amazing.

510
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:51,400
And we have books like the Habakkuk Peshir. That was also cave one. And that one jar, one of the

511
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:58,280
seven scrolls that was found. It's in the translation. You can read it. And it takes the Old Testament

512
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:06,440
or Hebrew Bible book of Habakkuk and then interprets it verse by verse. But it sees it in the light of

513
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:13,560
the history of the group, the Dead Sea Scroll Group, so that they actually apply it to their teacher.

514
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:21,560
So the lecture I gave or the YouTube video I gave was a bar lecture, biblical archaeology,

515
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:28,760
society lecture. Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return goes into that in great detail,

516
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:38,040
so you can listen to that to get more details. But I'm thinking that essentially they're waiting,

517
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,400
they have him, and then they're waiting for the two Messiahs. But I don't see any evidence in any

518
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,840
of the scrolls that the two Messiahs ever showed up. And what happens is the teacher's killed.

519
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:56,280
And on Yom Kippur, the priest, the wicked, he's called the wicked priest, because he's the priest

520
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:02,120
they think is illegitimate, the priest in Jerusalem, probably one of the high priests that we know about.

521
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:09,240
Depending on when you date the scrolls, it could go anywhere from the Maccabean period down to even

522
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:18,120
into the first century. I tend to think the teacher thrived in the first century BC. But we have priests

523
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,560
all the way through that period that are serving in the temple, and Josephus preserves their names.

524
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:28,760
We have all the names of these priests during this period. Well, this group considers one of them

525
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:34,760
a wicked priest, and he comes down on Yom Kippur. Now, here's a question. How could he travel on

526
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:42,120
Yom Kippur to the desert community at Comronus? I mean, I'm assuming for now that Comronus is

527
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:47,720
where the group was and where the teacher was. And some people would say there's no absolute

528
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,520
evidence for that. But I think it's a good possibility. How would he come on Yom Kippur?

529
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:57,960
Isn't the high priest in Jerusalem supposed to go into the temple on Yom Kippur? So he couldn't

530
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:05,880
be traveling down and persecuting this teacher of Comron unless they're using a different calendar.

531
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:12,600
And they are. Constantly on the scrolls, it says over and over again that I'm looking at my text

532
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:22,440
messages. Sorry, getting buzzed, but it's just this, that, and the other. Constantly you read about

533
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:30,600
the idea of the calendar being different in the days, months, seasons, and years being different

534
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:36,680
because they're using a solar calendar. And it's a beautiful calendar. It's a very interesting calendar

535
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:46,760
of, if you take a look at my YouTube lecture on my YouTube channel, it's called the Essene calendar

536
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,960
made simple. Believe it or not, you can make it simple and you can even put it on a single page.

537
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:57,560
I've got somewhere a page. I don't know if I have it right here, but I'm going to put it up on my

538
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:03,560
blog with that lecture where you can see what kind of calendar they had. As far as I know,

539
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:09,720
these two messiahs, though, didn't come. So the wicked priest, as his call came down and

540
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:17,080
persecuted the teacher, it's possible the teacher was killed. Maybe we're not absolutely sure about

541
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:22,920
that. And then the group decides that the end will come because remember it's an apocalyptic group.

542
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,560
They think they're going to live to see the end just like the followers of Jesus. And it didn't

543
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,520
come. And they say it's going to come in about 40 years. And then when 40 years passed, they,

544
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:40,920
instead of losing their faith, they talk about God has prolonged the seasons, has prolonged the

545
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:47,480
time. Very similar to the kind of thing you find, say, in Peter, I think, isn't it? Second Peter,

546
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,880
God's long suffering. You know, he doesn't always do things according to what people thought.

547
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:59,480
And they also conclude that all the times predicted by the book of Daniel have been

548
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:07,480
fulfilled, but the end didn't come. Therefore, not that we're wrong, but, you know, that our

549
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,120
interpretation is wrong, that they weren't fulfilled, because they haven't been fulfilled.

550
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:18,600
They believe that God is giving more grace, more time, and it's going to be longer. And even though

551
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:26,280
the date was right, God decided not to send the wrath and the judgment and the end of the age

552
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,160
on time, which would have been 40 years after the death of the teacher. How did they come up

553
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:40,600
with that 40 years? They believe there's a final cycle of 10 jubilees, 49-year jubilees, 490 years.

554
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:50,280
They interpret Daniel 9, the so-called 70 weeks prophecy, and they've placed their teacher in the

555
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:59,640
10th week. And then they begin to talk about in the final 49-year period, everything will come,

556
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,560
and then it didn't come. It didn't happen. And so they're basically disappointed. And they decide

557
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:14,360
that God has decided to prolong the days. How long did the movement last? It's hard to know,

558
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:20,520
but given this flexibility with the text of Habakkuk, I think we could presume that they went

559
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:26,680
into the first century. I would think some of the followers of John the Baptist and Jesus might have

560
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:32,920
had grandparents and parents that had known the teacher and maybe were kind of part of that general

561
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:40,600
Messianic movement. Eisman calls it the Messianic movement of Palestine. He uses the term Palestine,

562
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:47,240
which the scholars use to describe the Holy Land, but the Messianic movement of the land of Israel.

563
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:55,800
And I would say that there are probably remnants of that, because if you look at the Jesus movement,

564
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:02,440
there's just, as I mentioned, a lot of parallels. Not only the apocalyptic wilderness, new covenant

565
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:11,080
kind of thing, but also the idea of sacred meals, a bread and wine that you couldn't partake of.

566
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:17,240
It's called the pure meal of the saints, the specified ones. They're very separationist

567
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:26,520
in terms of their piety and their idea. They have a council of 12 and an inner council of three.

568
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:33,080
Does that remind you of anything? And yet the Jesus movement is very, very different from what

569
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:39,880
you read in the scrolls in terms of interpreting the Torah. The best example in this lecture is not

570
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,960
on that, but I want to kind of close with this, where you get a feeling of what they're all about.

571
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:51,000
In the scrolls, it says that if a beast or animal falls into a pit on the Sabbath,

572
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,160
you must not help the animal out, because it's the Sabbath. And there's a command in the Sabbath

573
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:02,520
that you stay in your dwelling. And they took that very literally. Literally, you don't leave the camp.

574
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:11,240
By the way, latrines, they don't even go outside the camp on the Sabbath to go to the toilet.

575
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,840
Josephus mentions that about the Essenes. He presents it as something admirable,

576
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:22,840
like, wow, they're so dedicated. They go for 24 hours without going to the toilet.

577
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:30,040
And some of you know that Josephus and I, a few years ago, we think we discovered the latrines

578
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:37,480
that come run exactly as the scrolls describe northwest of the camp, 1,000 cubits to 2,000

579
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:45,720
cubits away from the camp, hidden from view, is the area where we did soil samples and we think we

580
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:53,800
located their latrines. There's a cemetery nearby with over 1,100 graves, mostly male,

581
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,160
and there's some dispute about the female, because there are a few women,

582
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,840
and they haven't all been excavated just to sample. But Zias thinks that the women are

583
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:08,840
later burials of veteran women. They just took advantage of a local cemetery. They're not ancient.

584
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:17,880
But by far, most of them are men, and therefore possibly come run as a celibate community.

585
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:23,160
So you do get these parallels, which also get differences. Jesus says, I think it's in Luke,

586
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:29,240
which of you would not take a beast out of a pit on the Sabbath, as if to say,

587
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:35,400
anybody would do that. And believe me, you know, this picking grain on the Sabbath story that's

588
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:42,760
in Mark chapter 2 and Matthew chapter 12, where the disciples picked grain. The scrolls specifically

589
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:49,400
say that you must prepare your meals before the Sabbath. That's in the Torah, right? So you can,

590
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:55,160
that's considered, you didn't prepare that before the Sabbath. Also, it's threshing or harvesting,

591
01:00:55,160 --> 01:01:00,600
which is forbidden on the Sabbath. So they, the scroll people back in the days of the teacher

592
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:07,240
in the time when these things were written, the sectarian scrolls, they would just be appalled

593
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:15,000
that the disciples of Jesus are harvesting barley and popping the grain in their mouth when

594
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,800
they're famished. And if you remember, the response of Jesus was not like, oh, well, sorry, we broke

595
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,920
the law, but it was basically like, well, you know, the Sabbath's made for people, not people for the

596
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:33,800
Sabbath. So the idea of being humane to an animal or taking care of human need on the Sabbath,

597
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:40,280
which the Pharisees also taught, and they made certain allowances to allow you to keep the

598
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:46,280
Sabbath in less of a strict way. Whereas the carites later did not. And I'd have to check with

599
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:53,160
Namia Gordon to see today how they're defining the dwelling. Because if you can't go out of your

600
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:58,200
house during the Sabbath, you're dwelling. Does that mean your literal house you live in,

601
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:05,000
like the rooms you inhabit or apartment? Or does it mean your town? Or does it mean your city?

602
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,040
If you're in a large city, all these things are interpreted differently by Judaism over the years.

603
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:17,640
Some of you might know there is around the city of Jerusalem today a wire or thread like

604
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:25,160
element upon poles all the way around the city. And that the rabbis define Jerusalem as the dwelling

605
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,720
of the people in Jerusalem. So you don't go out of your dwelling, meaning you don't go out of the

606
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:34,280
city of Jerusalem, but you can go anywhere in the city of Jerusalem. This group would have been

607
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:41,000
horrified at any of those kinds of interpretations. I think they would have been very upset with Jesus

608
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:47,960
for any number of things that he did. So I don't think Jesus is part of this.

609
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:54,040
Some people think John the Baptist is and they try to make him really rigid and conservative.

610
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:59,400
But you know, the only traditions we have of John the Baptist, he's actually pretty accommodating.

611
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:06,760
He talks to Roman soldiers. He talks to tax collectors and blesses them and says,

612
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,960
you're fine. You can come in the movement. Of course, everybody has to repent. But I mean,

613
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:19,640
he seems like he's more accepting. I would put John the Baptist Jesus and James sort of on a plane,

614
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:24,920
even though they might have had some differences. So this is an election on the Jesus movement,

615
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:31,640
but because it's another parallel second temple, apocalyptic movement of the time I want to mention

616
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,920
it. So they're taking both movements, the Jesus movement and the Dead Sea Scroll movement.

617
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:43,480
They're reading these texts and we have to wonder what version. We know the Qumran group

618
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:50,440
was reading the version that we just studied, but is there evidence that in the New Testament that

619
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:57,160
some of the texts that were being quoted were actually, they're quoting more the Septuagint or

620
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:03,320
the Dead Sea Scrolls and the answer is yes. That's why some of the readings differ quite a bit,

621
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:07,800
because they're quoting a different version. They're not just changing the Bible they're using.

622
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,000
I guess you could say a different text of that particular book of the Bible.

623
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:18,120
So I hope that has been interesting to you. You'll get the Dead Sea Scroll Bible, delve into it.

624
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:25,000
I'm particularly excited about what Ross will be able to uncover in looking at all the scrolls of

625
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:31,720
Deuteronomy from the Dead Sea's collection and comparing them to the Shapira Scroll.

626
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:39,320
As I said earlier, that could be quite telling because Shapira would not have known

627
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:45,640
these versions of Deuteronomy in Hebrew if there are parallels and we've already seen a couple.

628
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:52,440
Then how would he have forged the document and made up readings that are later going to be discovered

629
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:59,640
in 1947 in caves? But remember he found the Moses Scroll in a cave wrapped in land with

630
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:07,640
the sticky residue around it. It sounds kind of like the discovery of the Qumran Scrolls.

631
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:14,680
So some of you are going on the trip with us in October and we'll do other trips as well in the

632
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:19,720
future if you can't make this one. But one of the things we're going to do is stay in the desert

633
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:25,160
for three nights I think and we're going to visit Qumran and we're going to visit Masada and we're

634
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:32,360
going to walk around these caves and it's going to be very exciting. Dead Sea Scroll news breaks

635
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:37,640
all the time like that Esther Scroll discovery that I just told you about. During the time I've

636
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:43,400
been teaching my Dead Sea Scroll class this semester we've had several major news stories on the

637
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:51,320
Dead Sea Scrolls break. So it's really an exciting field to be in. I'm really really interested

638
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:57,000
and fascinated with the Dead Sea Scrolls. I've studied them for years and I hope this will

639
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:13,240
encourage all of you to study them too. So Shabbat Shalom and wish you all well.

640
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:25,240
Thank you.
