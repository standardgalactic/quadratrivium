WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.040
to get started here. Hope everybody can see and hear okay. So today I'm going to

00:08.040 --> 00:14.360
talk to you about the Dead Sea Scrolls Bible and I'm using Bible and scare

00:14.360 --> 00:20.760
quotes because obviously nobody was carrying around the Dead Sea, you know,

00:20.760 --> 00:26.600
a printed Bible or even a handwritten Bible. But the books that are part of the

00:26.600 --> 00:34.040
Hebrew Bible, they are represented in the Dead Sea Scroll Library to some extent

00:34.040 --> 00:39.880
and that's what I want to talk about. Just as I start I want to introduce you

00:39.880 --> 00:45.560
to some resources because I'm teaching a course this semester on the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:45.560 --> 00:50.600
so I have everything right here and I know many of you are very interested. I

00:50.600 --> 00:57.400
would say the number one book that I would recommend, I got to figure out how

00:57.400 --> 01:02.920
to show this at the right angle without the glare, but it's Vander Cam and Flint.

01:02.920 --> 01:08.480
I think you all can see that. The meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls, you can get it in

01:08.480 --> 01:15.360
paperback. Highly recommended. This is the book on the scrolls. You really need

01:15.360 --> 01:20.320
it to be able to talk much about the scrolls or all of their background and

01:20.320 --> 01:25.320
to know the history and what they contain and who wrote them and how to date them

01:25.320 --> 01:30.320
and all the theories, all the interpretations. That book is a book

01:30.320 --> 01:36.320
that I always use and with all of my students. And as far as reading the

01:36.320 --> 01:40.800
scrolls, which is also important, I always tell the story in the 90s when I was

01:40.800 --> 01:45.920
lecturing here in Charlotte, North Carolina. When the scrolls were on exhibit

01:45.920 --> 01:50.280
here in Charlotte and there was this huge exhibit and we had a lecture at the

01:50.280 --> 01:54.920
Jewish Community Center. It was standing room only. It was unbelievable. They had

01:54.920 --> 01:59.280
to get chairs and open up the side. Everybody's interested in the scrolls

01:59.280 --> 02:05.120
and they had just been released through Robert Eisenman's efforts and Herschel

02:05.120 --> 02:11.680
Shanks at Bar Magazine and others. I was somewhat involved in that. And after my

02:11.680 --> 02:15.880
lecture, a woman came up and she said, oh Dr. Tabor, I'm so glad we have the

02:15.880 --> 02:21.880
scrolls finally because about probably a third of the scrolls had not been

02:21.880 --> 02:26.080
released until the 90s. So there was a big campaign. Some of you will remember

02:26.080 --> 02:32.280
Herschel Shanks really spearheaded it in Bar Magazine, but Robert Eisenman I think

02:32.280 --> 02:36.360
was really behind the scenes. And he's the one who actually got the photographs

02:36.360 --> 02:41.840
and then had them published. And then they were all public finally. So this is

02:41.840 --> 02:49.560
the complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English. It's a penguin paperback. The editor is

02:49.560 --> 02:56.880
Geza Vermish, V-E-R-M-E-S. I guess his name is not even on the front, but it's on

02:56.880 --> 03:02.520
the side I think. Not even the side. So he didn't write them. He doesn't want his

03:02.520 --> 03:08.080
name on, but he's the translator and it's a great addition. It has over a hundred

03:08.120 --> 03:15.520
pages of introductory material and then it also has lots of commentary and

03:15.520 --> 03:19.560
helps as you read the scrolls. But the main thing is it has the scrolls in

03:19.560 --> 03:25.880
English. So I really want to recommend this. So this woman was saying, oh I love

03:25.880 --> 03:30.840
the scrolls and I had a version of an earlier version of this and I said, oh

03:30.840 --> 03:36.040
have you read them yet? And she goes, oh no I haven't read them, but I just love

03:36.160 --> 03:40.920
that we have them. So I think a lot of people are in that situation where we

03:40.920 --> 03:44.720
talk about, oh finally we got the scrolls, but then you don't even read them.

03:44.720 --> 03:50.080
Maybe kind of like the Bible with people who love that we have the Bible, but

03:50.080 --> 03:55.720
they've never read it. Then I want to mention this is the year of the scrolls

03:55.720 --> 04:02.720
because here's a life magazine, the Dead Sea Scrolls, after 75 years. The race to

04:02.760 --> 04:08.240
solve an ancient mystery. You can get this at newsstands, grocery stores and so

04:08.240 --> 04:14.600
forth. I also, I ordered it from Amazon and then this one is very nice. This is

04:14.600 --> 04:19.920
the Dead Sea Scrolls. The subtitle is 75 years since their historic discovery.

04:19.920 --> 04:24.760
Both of these are worth having, but I would want the VanderKam and Flant the

04:24.760 --> 04:30.960
book. Most of the people listening to me in this audience I think are really good

04:31.000 --> 04:37.280
students and they like to study. Now that's in English. If you study Hebrew,

04:37.280 --> 04:42.240
which I know some of you do, you want to get it. It'll have a different cover.

04:42.240 --> 04:47.480
This is an edition I've had for several years. I think it's red now. Anyway, it's

04:47.480 --> 04:52.560
called the Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition. Be careful if you order it because

04:52.560 --> 04:56.600
there's a study edition that is just English, but as you see when I open this

04:56.640 --> 05:02.880
up, get a nice page of Hebrew here to show you. You can see you've got the

05:02.880 --> 05:08.960
English on one side and the Hebrew on the other. This is Martinez, the editor.

05:08.960 --> 05:15.520
Florentino Martinez. He's a good friend of mine. I see him at conferences. He works

05:15.520 --> 05:20.840
in Spain, in Madrid, I think, or maybe Barcelona. Yeah, I think Barcelona, but

05:20.840 --> 05:28.840
he's provided this wonderful study edition for students who want to read

05:28.840 --> 05:34.960
the Dead Sea Scrolls with Hebrew as well. Let me also mention that's

05:35.000 --> 05:41.720
introductory that I've recently put on my YouTube channel, which is, let's see,

05:41.800 --> 05:47.400
James Tabor videos. You can find it on YouTube. I've been putting up a lot of

05:47.440 --> 05:51.800
things. I've put up some things even this morning, but I've got three recent

05:51.800 --> 06:00.040
lectures that I did at the Biblical Archaeology Seminar over the years. One is

06:00.040 --> 06:08.240
called, let's see, I wrote this down, the exact names. Who wrote the Scrolls? So you

06:08.240 --> 06:15.480
can look at that. Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return. And I didn't tend that title to

06:15.480 --> 06:20.280
be kind of shocking or provocative, but at the end, I say, you know, one thing

06:20.280 --> 06:25.600
about all Messiahs, they've all died and they haven't come back yet. And I was

06:25.600 --> 06:29.640
mainly talking about the Teacher of Righteousness, who's the leader of the

06:29.640 --> 06:35.200
Dead Sea Scroll community. And then a third video, the Dead Sea Scroll calendar.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.680
You know, there are several Jewish calendars that are being used in the

06:40.720 --> 06:46.400
time of the Second Temple period for Christians the time of Jesus. There are

06:46.400 --> 06:50.720
three different main calendars, a lunar calendar, a solar lunar calendar, a

06:50.720 --> 06:56.440
solar calendar, and then it has to do with how you calculate the months and so

06:56.440 --> 07:04.800
forth. And I've got those up. And if you go to my blog, JamesTabor.com, I upload

07:04.800 --> 07:10.640
some documents. Here's a sample. These are printed documents that you can look

07:10.720 --> 07:15.640
at that go with the videos. So that's enough for education. The only other

07:15.640 --> 07:19.880
thing I would mention is the Wikipedia article. I know professors are not

07:19.880 --> 07:25.040
supposed to recommend Wikipedia to their students, but you know what, some of the

07:25.040 --> 07:30.880
Wikipedia articles are just excellent. If you want to go into some controversial

07:30.880 --> 07:35.840
thing or political thing, they can be tough. And I know religion can be

07:35.840 --> 07:40.360
controversial, but something like the Dead Sea Scrolls, the videos are, I mean,

07:41.360 --> 07:45.760
the articles in Wikipedia are fabulous. They really are. Very, very complete

07:45.760 --> 07:49.360
article. So that would be a good thing to read, too. You can print it out and

07:49.360 --> 07:54.280
study it if you don't know about the, much about the Dead Sea Scrolls. So I

07:54.280 --> 08:01.320
hope this lecture or lesson or class, I guess I could call it, would encourage

08:01.320 --> 08:06.280
you to delve into the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves. They certainly are the

08:06.280 --> 08:13.120
greatest archaeological discovery in our time. And I want to mention one

08:13.120 --> 08:19.360
other book. I think I have it here somewhere. Let's see. I thought I laid it

08:19.360 --> 08:26.200
down. It's, I was going to show Ross's book. Yeah, I got it. Because this is

08:26.200 --> 08:30.400
about a Dead Sea Scroll as well. The question is, was it a forgery or was it

08:30.400 --> 08:34.800
authentic or a genuine scroll? And then when would it date? So if you haven't

08:34.800 --> 08:38.680
heard about this, it was featured the other night on Coast to Coast. It's

08:38.680 --> 08:45.760
really getting out there and Ross has got a whole slate of interviews set up as a

08:45.760 --> 08:50.840
result of this book. So you should, most of you, I think many of you in this

08:50.840 --> 08:55.840
audience have heard of this, but in the back, there's a translation of what

08:55.840 --> 09:00.560
might be maybe the oldest and most important of all the Dead Sea Scrolls.

09:00.600 --> 09:06.320
We haven't been able to find it because it's disappeared, but Ross does a good

09:06.320 --> 09:11.480
transcription and translation of it. And I want to include that as well as part

09:11.480 --> 09:17.640
of the Dead Sea Scrolls. To read more about that, just go to themosiscroll.com,

09:17.640 --> 09:21.960
which is Ross's website. You can order the book through several means,

09:21.960 --> 09:27.160
including Amazon. Amazon, I think, is the publisher of it, or not the publisher,

09:27.160 --> 09:32.840
but the vehicle through which it was published. And also a blog where Nichols

09:32.840 --> 09:38.120
has put up a whole lot of entries about the scroll and everything about it. And

09:38.120 --> 09:43.680
in the last issue of Bar Magazine, I wrote an article with Edan Dershowitz,

09:43.680 --> 09:50.120
who's also working with us on the Moses Scroll, arguing that it is very likely

09:50.120 --> 09:54.680
authentic, that it's an authentic Dead Sea Scroll. But that's not what I'm talking

09:54.720 --> 10:00.560
about today. So all of that is plummeting. So what are the Dead Sea Scrolls? We've

10:00.560 --> 10:08.320
got 15,000 manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts. That's huge, representing

10:08.320 --> 10:15.800
probably 600 different works or books. And yet some of the books that are

10:15.800 --> 10:20.480
represented might just have a teeny piece or two that you could fit on just one

10:20.520 --> 10:24.880
page and just a fragment. And some of the fragments are the size of like a

10:24.880 --> 10:29.720
matchbook cover or even a thumbnail with only a couple of letters. So when we say

10:29.720 --> 10:34.520
15,000 fragments, don't get too excited like you're going to have complete

10:34.520 --> 10:40.640
copies of things. However, there are some complete copies of some of the scrolls.

10:40.640 --> 10:46.200
They were mostly found in Cave 1 and then Cave 11 and then the Copper Scroll in

10:46.240 --> 10:52.640
Cave 3. And Cave 1 was just a treasure because you had something called the

10:52.640 --> 10:58.800
Community Rule, which is the charter of the group that wrote the scrolls or wrote

10:58.800 --> 11:03.960
the sectarian scrolls. I'll explain that in a minute as to what these 600 books

11:03.960 --> 11:08.800
are. Books that they wrote about their own group and their own movement kind of

11:08.800 --> 11:13.440
like the Christians have the New Testament as their writings. So the Dead Sea

11:13.480 --> 11:21.680
Scroll group had their own writings. And another one is the Thanksgiving Hymns,

11:21.680 --> 11:27.040
which some of which were written by the teacher, their leader, we think, like he

11:27.040 --> 11:31.480
uses the first person. We think he actually wrote these. So we've got that

11:31.480 --> 11:38.160
from Cave 1. You've got as well the War Scroll from Cave 1 and a number of other

11:38.160 --> 11:45.000
scrolls that are very complete. So if you break down the scrolls, about 30% of

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
them are written by the group. We call them the sectarian scrolls. These are the

11:50.000 --> 11:55.040
scrolls where the group is talking about how they were formed and what they're

11:55.040 --> 11:59.440
all about and what their vision of things is and what their history is and so

11:59.440 --> 12:06.400
forth. So that's like almost a third are written by the group. And those are the

12:06.440 --> 12:13.000
ones I specialize in. And then there's another 30% that are copies of texts that

12:13.000 --> 12:18.400
they didn't write, but texts that are not the Hebrew Bible, but books that you

12:18.400 --> 12:22.680
would recognize the names of, even if you haven't read them, like Jubilees, the

12:22.680 --> 12:27.040
Book of Jubilees. They love the Book of Jubilees. It fits their solar calendar

12:27.040 --> 12:34.160
that they used. And Enoch, not all of Enoch because Enoch is an Ethiopic, the

12:34.240 --> 12:39.320
complete thing that we now have, but they had of the five parts of Enoch, they

12:39.320 --> 12:45.720
had four of them and they did use them. And in fact, some of the Aramaic Enoch

12:45.720 --> 12:49.880
texts are the oldest copies of Enoch that we have. And Enoch is quoted in

12:49.880 --> 12:55.760
the New Testament in the Book of Jude. And there are a lot of other references

12:55.760 --> 13:00.080
in the New Testament, just allusions to some of the language of the Book of

13:00.080 --> 13:07.600
Enoch. So people in the Second Temple period from, let's say, about the Maccabees

13:07.600 --> 13:12.120
down through Bar Kokba, or down through the destruction of Jerusalem and on to

13:12.120 --> 13:20.560
Bar Kokba, 1st century CE, they're making use of these books and using them

13:20.560 --> 13:26.440
all during that period. And then what we want to do today, 40% of the Dead Sea

13:26.480 --> 13:33.000
Scrolls are copies of books of the Hebrew Bible. So I want to introduce you to a

13:33.000 --> 13:39.520
book if you don't know it. I highly, highly recommend this book. I'm going to

13:39.520 --> 13:44.760
read you the blurb on it in just a minute, but I want you to be able to see it

13:44.760 --> 13:50.440
or get a screenshot of it. The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible, the oldest known Bible

13:50.440 --> 13:57.840
translated for the first time into English. And the authors are Abeg, Flint, and

13:57.840 --> 14:05.960
Ulrich. And it's really an amazing production. So what is this? Of those 40% of

14:05.960 --> 14:14.480
the Dead Sea Scrolls, of the 1500 fragments, 600 volumes, the ones that

14:14.480 --> 14:19.160
are copies of the Bible are in this book. So you actually have the Dead Sea Scroll

14:19.200 --> 14:25.640
Bible. What it says at the top, over a thousand years older than any previously

14:25.640 --> 14:30.800
discovered biblical manuscripts with material never before published or

14:30.800 --> 14:36.600
translated, including hundreds of new and different readings and several lost

14:36.600 --> 14:47.360
Psalms that actually could conceivably go into the book of Psalms. There's a Psalm

14:47.400 --> 14:52.600
151, for example, that the Oxford Annotated RSV actually includes as well as

14:52.600 --> 14:59.480
the new Oxford RSV. So highly recommend this book, because this is what I'm

14:59.480 --> 15:07.240
going to talk from today. So who wrote the scrolls just before we start? Who is

15:07.240 --> 15:11.240
this group so that we know something about them? I could give a complete

15:11.240 --> 15:15.680
lecture on that, and I did. I mentioned I have a lecture on YouTube, and you can

15:15.680 --> 15:19.840
find it on YouTube and listen to it with a lot of supplementary material on my

15:19.840 --> 15:26.040
blog that goes with it. But usually people say, oh, the S-scenes wrote the

15:26.040 --> 15:31.160
scrolls. The Dead Sea Scroll group are the S-scenes. Well, obviously they didn't

15:31.160 --> 15:34.880
write all the scrolls, because you've got books like Jubilee's and Enoch that they

15:34.880 --> 15:39.720
didn't write, and you've got the Hebrew Bible, which they didn't write. But that

15:39.760 --> 15:46.960
30% is written by the group, and some of those even by the teacher himself. And so

15:46.960 --> 15:53.240
we could talk about scrolls that they wrote and who they were. I don't think

15:53.240 --> 15:58.200
the word S-scene is very helpful. I think the group that wrote the scrolls is

15:58.200 --> 16:04.840
described by Josephus as the S-scenes. So if you go to book two of the Jewish

16:04.960 --> 16:10.280
war, you can read his long description of the S-scenes. And he's very positive

16:10.280 --> 16:15.560
about them. But remember, he's writing for the impervest patient. He's living in

16:15.560 --> 16:24.560
Rome. It's around 75 CE after the destruction of Jerusalem. And he wants to

16:24.600 --> 16:30.520
talk about the traditions of the Jewish people and the schools, philosophical

16:30.560 --> 16:36.440
schools, as the way he describes them. Pharisees, Sadducees, and S-scenes. And so

16:36.440 --> 16:42.080
he presents them in Hellenistic guard. And also he presents them in ways that the

16:42.080 --> 16:49.040
emperor would not find objectionable. Now that we have the scrolls, you can call

16:49.040 --> 16:54.240
them S-scenes if you want, but don't go to Josephus for your definition of S-scenes

16:54.960 --> 17:00.440
because he makes them kind of quietists and pacifists and they're a secluded

17:00.440 --> 17:05.600
group. They sound a lot like the Pythagoreans. And then of course he makes

17:05.600 --> 17:13.120
the Pharisees sound like Epicureans. And he makes, I'm sorry, the Sadducees. And

17:13.120 --> 17:18.400
then the Pharisees he would make, he would describe in ways that would remind

17:18.400 --> 17:22.680
you of the Platonists, or particularly the Stoics probably. So you see what he's

17:22.720 --> 17:28.640
doing. So to understand the Dead Sea Scroll group, again, it's better to read

17:28.640 --> 17:33.640
their own self-description. And what they, what we come up with, if you read the

17:33.640 --> 17:38.840
Dead Sea Scrolls, the books that they wrote, I would describe them like this.

17:38.840 --> 17:47.640
You ready? An apocalyptic, messianic, new covenant group, baptizing, you have to

17:47.640 --> 17:52.560
be baptized, and I'm using, it's a mikvah, it's Jewish mikvah, but probably in

17:52.560 --> 17:58.200
a running stream like the Jordan River, or the Dead Sea. You could presumably be

17:58.200 --> 18:02.080
baptized in the Dead Sea because you probably want to hold your eyes really

18:02.080 --> 18:06.000
tight when you go under, but you could do that. And maybe they did baptize in the

18:06.000 --> 18:12.400
Dead Sea. So apocalyptic, messianic, new covenant. They claimed that they were the

18:12.400 --> 18:16.760
people of the new covenant. They were, God has established the new covenant. They

18:16.920 --> 18:24.560
were the ones separatists, communal living, and preparing the way in the desert, the

18:24.560 --> 18:31.120
Aravah, Isaiah 40, verse three. Just as the New Testament opens in the Gospel of

18:31.120 --> 18:40.000
Mark, with John the baptizer out in the desert, along the Jordan Valley, preaching

18:40.000 --> 18:45.360
and baptizing and people and people say, who are you? And he says, I'm the voice of

18:45.400 --> 18:50.080
one calling in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord. So when I say they're

18:50.080 --> 18:54.480
people of the way, that might remind you of something in the Book of Acts, the

18:54.480 --> 18:59.080
New Testament Book of Acts, because they also pick up the same language. So people

18:59.080 --> 19:05.160
of the way means people of the desert way, people that are following the Torah,

19:05.520 --> 19:11.640
according to the interpretations of this group, and what we call halakha or

19:12.640 --> 19:19.920
interpretations of Torah. So whether you call them messians or not, basically go to

19:19.920 --> 19:25.080
the scrolls for a definition. Now, none of those terms would describe the Pharisees.

19:25.320 --> 19:31.080
None of those terms would describe the Sadducees. And yet those terms do describe

19:31.080 --> 19:35.960
this group. And I would say every one of those terms also describes the Jesus

19:35.960 --> 19:40.400
movement. So when the scrolls were discovered, people were very, very

19:40.400 --> 19:46.440
excited and keen, but also a little nervous, because it's like we found an

19:46.440 --> 19:50.560
apocalyptic messianic group thinking they're preparing the way in the

19:50.560 --> 19:55.920
wilderness, saying they're people of the New Covenant, communal living, separatists,

19:55.960 --> 20:01.440
baptizing into the group and so forth. They're doing all of these things. And

20:02.080 --> 20:06.680
basically my screen went out. I'm going to put it back. It doesn't matter, but I'd

20:06.680 --> 20:12.160
rather not talk to a blank screen. So give me just a second. I need to probably,

20:13.720 --> 20:21.440
sorry about that. This is probably going to happen over and over. So anyway,

20:23.360 --> 20:29.600
where was I? I was talking about the, oh, how people were maybe a bit nervous

20:29.600 --> 20:36.440
because they would think, well, you know, is this like a precursor of the

20:36.440 --> 20:43.360
Jesus movement? Or, you know, did the Jesus move a kind of copy or did they

20:43.360 --> 20:46.280
come from this group or whatever? But we're not going to talk about that

20:46.280 --> 20:51.160
today. So, but it is a good topic to talk about the relationship of the

20:51.160 --> 20:54.680
Jesus movement, the John the Baptist movement, followers of James the

20:54.680 --> 20:58.440
brother of Jesus, how they might have related to the Dead Sea Scroll group.

20:58.720 --> 21:05.160
I've written a lot about that in my books, such as the Jesus Diocese. Now, as

21:05.160 --> 21:11.560
far as the 40% of the scrolls that do have the Hebrew copies of the Hebrew

21:11.560 --> 21:18.400
Bible, there's one book supposedly missing. And it just so happens that it's

21:18.400 --> 21:23.080
not missing anymore. Some of you who want to look this up, you could paste the

21:23.080 --> 21:29.960
URL maybe in one of the chats on YouTube or Facebook. But recently, just

21:29.960 --> 21:36.640
recently, the book of Esther has been identified as fragments of the Dead Sea

21:36.640 --> 21:40.280
Scrolls. So if you've ever heard, and you still read this, if you look it up,

21:40.840 --> 21:45.680
that they had copies of all the books of the Hebrew Bible, except for Esther in

21:45.680 --> 21:50.760
the Amaya. Well, Esther has now been located. And it's an article at the

21:50.760 --> 21:59.040
website, thetora.com. So if you go to thetora.com, it's called newly deciphered

21:59.040 --> 22:04.680
Comron Scroll revealed to be Esther. So it's really easy to find. It's by, let's

22:04.680 --> 22:10.120
see, Rabbi Asher Tovlev. And it's a really exciting story because you know why

22:10.120 --> 22:15.560
they hadn't identified Esther? Because somebody spilled some wine on it. And it

22:15.560 --> 22:19.840
was stained and you couldn't make it out. But now through photographic means,

22:19.880 --> 22:26.360
they've been able to make it out, which is really amazing. So what we want to do

22:26.360 --> 22:31.520
today, I'm going to switch on my reading light here, where I can see better what

22:31.520 --> 22:39.920
I want to do is I want to take this Dead Sea Scroll Bible. And I want to pick five

22:39.920 --> 22:48.040
different, let's see, is it five or six, one, two, three, actually, it's four

22:48.040 --> 22:52.040
different references, but some of them have more than one. I'm going to pick four

22:52.040 --> 23:00.480
or five places within here. You see, I've got a mark here, where the Hebrew Bible

23:00.480 --> 23:04.440
that we have, the Masoretic text differs from the readings that are in the

23:04.440 --> 23:08.840
scrolls. And that's what I want to talk about. Now, here's the problem with that.

23:08.840 --> 23:14.480
Many people talk about the Hebrew Bible. I've got a Hebrew Bible right here. This

23:14.600 --> 23:19.440
is the standard scholarly edition of the Hebrew Bible. It's called the BHS,

23:19.440 --> 23:26.280
Biblia Hebraica Stuttgart, Densia Stuttgart, the German. It's where it was put

23:26.280 --> 23:32.840
out, put in Latin. It's referred to as the BHS. And you can see here on the page,

23:32.840 --> 23:37.440
if I put it really close at the bottom, that you've got all of these variant

23:37.440 --> 23:43.200
readings. So even though people talk about, I want to go by the Masoretic text,

23:43.240 --> 23:48.480
you have to realize even the Masoretic text, the traditional Hebrew text, like

23:48.480 --> 23:57.400
some of you use the Koran Bible, K-O-R-E-N. It's a standardized text that's

23:57.400 --> 24:03.440
been standardized by the rabbis of hundreds of years ago, but there are

24:03.440 --> 24:10.680
variants. And many of you probably remember or know Bart Ehrman, who is the

24:10.680 --> 24:15.920
New Testament scholar. And he was trained at Princeton. And when he learned as a

24:15.920 --> 24:20.560
student that there are all these variants in the New Testament, it really

24:20.560 --> 24:24.440
disturbed him because he was raised as a very conservative Christian and

24:24.440 --> 24:30.840
whatever the traditional Byzantine texts of the Greek New Testament said, he

24:30.840 --> 24:35.400
just felt it had to be perfect without any kind of mistakes or variants. And

24:35.400 --> 24:39.120
then when he began going to graduate school and finding out that there are

24:39.160 --> 24:43.520
literally hundreds of variants, now what you'll often hear is, well, the Masoretic

24:43.520 --> 24:47.440
text, it doesn't have any variants. You know how people count the letters and

24:47.440 --> 24:51.520
they do these Bible code things. But all you need is one variant and the whole

24:51.520 --> 24:56.120
Bible code is thrown off, right? Because all the letters would then shift even by

24:56.120 --> 25:01.800
one letter. And so I'm not too fond of the Bible code concept because I happen

25:01.800 --> 25:07.480
to know that the text you're searching is just one of several copies of the

25:07.480 --> 25:14.800
Masoretic text. The one that is used by in the BHS is the Leningrad Codex. It's

25:14.800 --> 25:20.800
the oldest copy of the Hebrew Bible Masoretic text, as we call it. The

25:20.800 --> 25:26.720
traditional texts is maybe another way to refer to it. That's complete. There's

25:26.720 --> 25:32.440
the Aleppo Codex that's a little bit older, but part of it was destroyed by

25:32.440 --> 25:38.040
actually anti-Semites who raided the place and tried to burn the scroll. But

25:38.320 --> 25:43.040
fortunately, most of it did survive and it's on display in Jerusalem. If you've

25:43.600 --> 25:49.480
been there and seen that, it's in the shrine of the book there in Jerusalem. So

25:49.480 --> 25:52.880
anyway, when you talk about the Hebrew Bible, here's what we've got. We've got

25:52.880 --> 25:58.080
the Masoretic text, but it does have variations. At the bottom of every page,

25:58.080 --> 26:03.400
you can see these other readings of other copies of it because copyists make

26:03.400 --> 26:10.240
mistakes and variations creep in over the centuries. We've also got what's

26:10.240 --> 26:17.120
called the Septuagint, LXX. You'll see it abbreviated. That's a translation of

26:17.120 --> 26:24.000
the Hebrew Bible that we think was made in the second century, DCE. And we do

26:24.000 --> 26:28.640
have manuscripts of the Septuagint, quite a few that have survived. And it

26:28.640 --> 26:32.240
doesn't always read the same as the Hebrew Bible either. So you've got other

26:32.240 --> 26:38.400
versions. And then the Samaritan Pentateuch. Now that's only the five books of

26:38.400 --> 26:44.400
Moses, but the Samaritan Pentateuch does differ in places with the Masoretic

26:44.400 --> 26:50.200
texts. So that would be three different versions of the Torah, at least. And of

26:50.200 --> 26:54.120
the Hebrew Bible in general, you would have two versions, the Masoretic texts

26:54.120 --> 26:58.240
with its variants, as well as the Septuagint. And of course, the Septuagint

26:58.240 --> 27:04.360
would have variants also. And then you add the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is not

27:04.360 --> 27:10.960
complete because we don't have absolute copies of every single book of the

27:10.960 --> 27:18.240
Hebrew Bible. But it is, in fact, another tradition. And sometimes the readings of

27:18.280 --> 27:23.640
the Dead Sea Scrolls agree with this Septuagint. The first or second

27:23.640 --> 27:28.240
example we're going to have today, we're going to consider today, actually agrees

27:28.240 --> 27:36.160
with the Greek, not the Masoretic texts. And so scholars have been busy now for

27:36.160 --> 27:42.080
75 years doing all of these comparisons and trying to figure it out. This

27:42.080 --> 27:47.120
bothers some people. I hope it doesn't bother you who are listening. I don't

27:47.120 --> 27:51.120
want it to bother you. Tell my students, I don't want it to bother them either.

27:51.920 --> 27:58.680
Because what you don't want to do is trade one fundamentalism for another. Many

27:58.680 --> 28:05.480
of, I was raised in a fairly conservative Christian tradition. And the

28:05.480 --> 28:10.200
tradition I came out of, the Campbellite or Churches of Christ, they would have

28:10.200 --> 28:14.240
said by and large, although they're probably liberalized a little here and

28:14.280 --> 28:18.680
there over the years. But they would have said, you know, the Bible is inspired

28:18.680 --> 28:23.360
and it's perfect and it has no mistakes. And they just don't like variations. And

28:23.360 --> 28:27.480
yet there are variations. When I first took Greek, I've got my Greek New

28:27.480 --> 28:32.120
Testament here. This is the Greek New Testament. And you can see it's very,

28:32.120 --> 28:37.560
very similar. It's got all of those variations at the bottom of the Greek

28:37.560 --> 28:42.360
text. So we shouldn't wish for something that we don't have. We have

28:42.360 --> 28:46.400
different versions of the Hebrew Bible, different versions of the New

28:46.400 --> 28:51.920
Testament, actually different versions of every single book from antiquity. This

28:51.920 --> 29:00.120
is actually a treasure of riches. We want that sort of thing because we want

29:00.120 --> 29:05.120
all the possible information we can. Now, when the Dead Sea Scrolls were

29:05.120 --> 29:13.520
discovered, Cave One, there were 10 jars and only one had scrolls. And Cave

29:13.520 --> 29:18.240
One in the jar with the seven scrolls that were in that jar was a complete copy

29:18.240 --> 29:22.320
of the book of Isaiah. I've got a book over here with the original colored

29:22.320 --> 29:28.320
pictures that Trevor did, the scholar Trevor living in Jerusalem at the

29:28.320 --> 29:34.760
Albright. Beautiful pictures that are still used today in color. So everybody

29:34.760 --> 29:38.680
wondered, well, if you compared the Isaiah of the Masoretic text, the

29:38.680 --> 29:43.960
traditional Hebrew text, with the Dead Sea Scroll copy, because the Leningrad

29:43.960 --> 29:51.920
Codex, the oldest copy of the Masoretic text, is about a thousand AD CE. And the

29:51.920 --> 29:58.920
Dead Sea Scroll Isaiah is probably 150-200 BCE. So you've jumped back over a

29:58.920 --> 30:05.600
thousand years, probably 1200 years. It's hard to date exactly. But in that

30:05.600 --> 30:09.640
amazing, so you want to kind of compare it. It is our book of Isaiah. It has the

30:09.640 --> 30:15.320
same number of sections and chapters and it essentially has the same contents. But

30:15.320 --> 30:19.880
there are thousands of variations where it reads differently. And sometimes those

30:19.880 --> 30:25.640
variations agree with the Septuagint or the Samaritan penitent. Now usually,

30:25.680 --> 30:30.120
people will say, well, it was essentially the same. And that's true. And it's also

30:30.120 --> 30:35.920
false. But it probably depends on what you mean essentially. It is

30:35.920 --> 30:40.520
essentially the same. But essentially the same doesn't mean you shouldn't notice

30:40.520 --> 30:44.200
the differences, as I'm going to show you today, because the differences could be

30:44.200 --> 30:50.720
significant. And get ready for this. Some of the readings in the Dead Sea Scrolls

30:51.040 --> 30:57.400
parallel the Moses Scroll. And Ross Nichols is currently working on a project to

30:57.400 --> 31:02.400
compare all the readings of the Dead Sea Scrolls of Deuteronomy. And did you know

31:02.400 --> 31:08.040
some of those are Paleo-Ebru, actually written in the ancient script, with the

31:08.040 --> 31:13.000
Moses Scroll transcript that we have. And that's going to be a pretty long

31:13.000 --> 31:17.440
project. But he has begun that project. So that's going to be pretty interesting.

31:17.480 --> 31:21.360
And I'm going to show you one of those today, one of the parallels, where the

31:21.360 --> 31:27.160
Moses Scroll reads the same as one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is very,

31:27.160 --> 31:32.560
very interesting. It sounds like maybe it's not a forgery, because I don't

31:32.560 --> 31:38.160
think Moses Shapiro had copies of the Comron Scrolls, at least, that were

31:38.160 --> 31:47.040
found in 1947. I would encourage you all to, when you think about, you know,

31:47.080 --> 31:52.360
fundamentalism and the Hebrew faith, and what it is to follow the God of Israel,

31:52.360 --> 31:59.600
and so forth, to have an open view that there are pillars of the faith, the

31:59.600 --> 32:06.240
call of Abraham, the Torah given at Sinai, the prophets, and so forth, that

32:06.240 --> 32:12.240
seem to be bedrock for all forms of Judaism and Hebrew faith, even Gentiles

32:12.240 --> 32:18.680
that adhere to the Hebrew faith. But essentially, you know, you don't have

32:18.680 --> 32:24.680
to have a set view of what the text has to be, if it doesn't conform to what

32:25.120 --> 32:30.360
we're discovering or what the facts are. And I think most of the people in

32:30.360 --> 32:35.080
these particular audiences of the United Israel World Union, which is sponsoring

32:35.080 --> 32:42.200
this talk that I'm presenting here, this class, I think most of the people who

32:42.520 --> 32:47.120
follow Ross Nichols' teaching week by week, he teaches on this channel every

32:47.560 --> 32:53.080
week at the same time. And you're used to this, like you want all the

32:53.080 --> 32:57.880
scholarly information possible, and I'm glad that that's the case. It's not a

32:57.880 --> 33:04.520
threat, it's a treasure trove of riches to delve into these things. So let's

33:04.520 --> 33:11.520
start with Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 12. If you have a Hebrew Bible, whatever

33:11.560 --> 33:16.960
translation doesn't matter, because it'll probably be the Messeridic text, go

33:16.960 --> 33:23.320
ahead and turn to Deuteronomy 5, and you will then have the standard version of

33:23.320 --> 33:29.840
the traditional Hebrew text. So it's on page 154 in this Dead Sea Scrolls Bible.

33:29.840 --> 33:36.920
If you have the book, you can follow along with the book. And it has to do

33:36.920 --> 33:42.000
with the 10 words. One of the ways of describing people say, what is United

33:42.000 --> 33:49.640
Israel World Union? It was formed in 1944 by a Jewish correspondent and Bible

33:49.640 --> 33:56.840
student. His name was David Horowitz. And David Horowitz coined the idea of

33:56.840 --> 34:02.600
decalogue faith for all nations. And we like that very much. The idea would be

34:02.600 --> 34:09.040
the essential faith around the 10 words, the 10 commandments, should be for the

34:09.040 --> 34:14.880
whole world, not simply for Jews. And so the decalogue faith. And as you know, one

34:14.880 --> 34:21.760
command of the decalogue faith is, in fact, the Sabbath, to keep the Sabbath.

34:21.760 --> 34:27.760
Today is the Sabbath. So either remember or observe the Sabbath day. So verse 12

34:27.760 --> 34:32.800
does in fact say, observe the Sabbath day, keep it holy, as the Lord commanded you.

34:32.800 --> 34:38.520
And it's actually the divine name, Y-H-V-H, which they write in Paleo Hebrew, by

34:38.520 --> 34:43.200
the way. Six days you will labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a

34:43.200 --> 34:50.320
Sabbath to the Lord your God, and so forth. You should do no work. Now in Deuteronomy,

34:50.320 --> 34:57.120
you have this idea that the reason you do this is because God brought the people

34:57.120 --> 35:04.040
of Israel out of Egypt. And that's also in Exodus 31 as the reason. But as you

35:04.040 --> 35:11.080
know, there's also the idea that God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath. For in

35:11.080 --> 35:15.880
six days the Lord made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is in them, and

35:15.880 --> 35:21.840
rested the seventh day, so that the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.

35:22.280 --> 35:30.080
Now that's not in the Masoretic text at this spot of Deuteronomy. It is in the

35:30.080 --> 35:36.440
Moses scroll. So there's the example. And there's one of this, the Dead Sea Scroll

35:36.440 --> 35:42.160
copy. It's actually 4Q Deuteronomy. It's called from Cave 4. It's a fragment of

35:42.160 --> 35:47.560
Deuteronomy. It has the idea that the Sabbath goes back to the creation. So

35:47.560 --> 35:53.440
it's connecting to Genesis 1 and 2 in the same way that the Moses scroll does.

35:53.440 --> 35:59.280
And if you compare Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, you can see the two

35:59.280 --> 36:05.600
versions. So this could be seen as an attempt to harmonize, like let's give

36:05.600 --> 36:12.920
both reasons. But on the other hand, it could also be seen as maybe a tradition

36:12.960 --> 36:17.040
that the Dead Sea Scroll group is preserving that would be older than

36:17.040 --> 36:22.840
the later tradition that we know as the Masoretic text. So that's the first

36:22.840 --> 36:29.160
example I want to give. The second one is a couple of verses. It's in what's

36:29.160 --> 36:36.120
called the Song of Moses, and it's Deuteronomy 32. So if you go to Deuteronomy

36:36.160 --> 36:46.680
32, and you can see down at verse 8, a very well-known verse that says,

36:46.680 --> 36:53.920
when the Most High separated or gave to the nations their inheritance, he

36:53.920 --> 36:59.960
separated humankind, and he set the bounds of the peoples according to the

36:59.960 --> 37:05.560
number of the children of Israel. That's the Masoretic text. That's probably what

37:05.880 --> 37:10.520
the translation says that most of you are reading, depending on which one you're

37:10.520 --> 37:19.240
reading. However, in the Dead Sea Scroll portion, it says, according to the

37:20.280 --> 37:26.680
sons of Elohim, the children of God, and it uses Elohim. Isn't that interesting?

37:26.680 --> 37:31.640
Because Elohim is also used in the Moses Scroll, as you know. Many of you know

37:31.880 --> 37:39.400
read about it or read the book. So the sons of Elohim. Now the sons of Elohim

37:39.400 --> 37:44.040
could be considered the children of Israel, I suppose, but because of another

37:44.040 --> 37:50.200
verse in this same chapter, or in the same song, if you go down to verse 43,

37:50.760 --> 37:57.640
it's pretty clear that it's talking about the sons of God, or the Bene Elohim,

37:57.640 --> 38:02.520
as it is in Hebrew, that are the hosts that surround God.

38:04.040 --> 38:09.640
Did I say Psalm 82? Remember, it talks about how God sits and is surrounded

38:10.600 --> 38:19.080
by all of these gods, or Elohim. So here's what verse 43 says in the Dead Sea Scrolls,

38:19.080 --> 38:25.960
and this would be a 4-Q Deuteronomy also. K-4, the copy of Deuteronomy.

38:26.520 --> 38:30.520
It reads like this. This is going to be different from what you have if you have the

38:30.520 --> 38:37.880
Maseridic text. Rejoice, O heavens, together with him, and bow down to him all you gods,

38:38.440 --> 38:42.520
for he will avenge the blood of his sons, his children, his

38:43.800 --> 38:50.280
banim, and will render vengeance to his enemies, and will recompense those who hate him, and will

38:50.280 --> 38:57.960
atone for the land of his people. And so it's actually talking about bow down to him you gods,

38:57.960 --> 39:06.840
this reference to you gods, or in the Sattuagen even has sons of God, which seems again to be these

39:09.640 --> 39:14.760
ruling powers that are spoken of a number of times in the Hebrew Bible. I think I have this

39:14.840 --> 39:22.440
book handy, let's see. If I do have it handy, I recommend. This includes the New Testament too,

39:22.440 --> 39:27.000
but the part on the Hebrew Bible is really good. Michael Heiser's book, The Unseen Realm.

39:28.600 --> 39:33.960
Michael has an article online. You can look it up called The Bene Elohim, The Sons of God. It's

39:33.960 --> 39:38.760
really good. He did his dissertation on that subject, and he's a real expert on it. It's

39:38.760 --> 39:45.400
something to really study. So here you have a text in the Dead Sea Scrolls that is talking about the

39:45.400 --> 39:54.120
Bene Elohim as seemingly parallel to Psalm 82, meaning these heavenly beings, not simply talking

39:54.120 --> 39:59.960
about the flesh and blood Israelites. So I think that's pretty interesting as we go along.

40:00.120 --> 40:09.160
Now, Isaiah 53. Isaiah 53 is really, really interesting. It was in Cave One in that jar

40:09.160 --> 40:15.000
that had the seven scrolls, and it's a complete copy of Isaiah. Actually, I'm going to pull up

40:15.000 --> 40:25.080
my copy here to show you because it's so beautiful. I want you to see, and I think this is the color

40:25.160 --> 40:31.720
one. Yep, this is the color one. So you can buy this. These are the photographs that Trevor

40:31.720 --> 40:38.520
originally made. You've got the black and white in the color. Absolutely gorgeous photographs. If

40:38.520 --> 40:44.520
you've been to Israel and been to the shrine of the book, there's a replica of this scroll wrapped

40:44.520 --> 40:52.200
around the central scroll display area where you can see it almost like it's wrapped around

40:52.200 --> 41:00.040
like a Torah scroll. And Israelis have fun taking their kids to see the Dead Sea Scrolls because

41:00.040 --> 41:06.120
any kid in Israel can just read Isaiah right off the page, even though it's in this Herodian script.

41:06.120 --> 41:13.400
So it's pretty amazing how things have not changed. However, does Isaiah have changes?

41:13.400 --> 41:19.160
Often, I remember when I first studied this, I was in a more conservative school, Abilene

41:19.160 --> 41:24.200
Christian University, and there was more an emphasis on, you know, it's basically the same

41:24.200 --> 41:29.240
as the Masoretic Text, and it is. It's basically the same as the Masoretic Text, and it's quite

41:29.240 --> 41:35.800
remarkable that Isaiah is preserved to that degree. However, it does have interesting readings that are

41:35.800 --> 41:43.640
different. A few of them are pretty minor, but I'm going to mention a few of them, but some of them

41:43.880 --> 41:51.480
are quite strikingly different. So Isaiah 53, which is the famous Suffering Servant Hymn of Isaiah,

41:51.480 --> 41:58.280
one of the four Suffering Servant Hymns, as they're traditionally known by scholars,

41:58.280 --> 42:04.760
Hebrew Bible scholars. And I'm going to read verse three. He was despised and rejected by others,

42:05.720 --> 42:13.320
and, I'm reading the Dead Sea version, and a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering,

42:14.280 --> 42:25.160
and like one from whom people hide their faces, and we despised him and did not value him.

42:26.200 --> 42:33.720
So the footnote explains that he was despised is the Masoretic Text. Remember, he was despised and

42:33.720 --> 42:40.280
rejected. Many people have that memorized. Notice this says we despised him, and so in the Dead Sea

42:40.280 --> 42:47.560
Squall version of Isaiah, it's in the first person that we, and that would go with verse four.

42:47.560 --> 42:55.240
Surely he has borne our sufferings and so forth. If you go on down to, let's see, verse eight,

42:57.080 --> 43:02.520
in the middle of verse, just the last part of verse eight, for he was cut off from the land of

43:02.520 --> 43:12.520
the living. He was stricken for the transgression of my people, and it's actually his people.

43:13.400 --> 43:19.720
Instead of Ami, it's Ammo, his people in the Dead Sea version. Does that make a difference? Does

43:19.720 --> 43:24.920
that make a difference? Well, you can write it down and study it and think about it. You have to

43:24.920 --> 43:30.600
read the whole chapter and think about it. But this is a version that has some parallels. And

43:30.680 --> 43:37.960
remember, some of these are also, these readings that we're going over today, are also paralleled in

43:37.960 --> 43:43.800
the Septuagint, the Greek translation, meaning that the Greek translators were also using a copy of

43:43.800 --> 43:50.760
the Hebrew Bible that would be closer to what we have in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Verse nine says,

43:50.760 --> 43:59.800
And they made his grave with the wicked. I believe the Masoretic text has he made, doesn't it? Let's

43:59.800 --> 44:07.560
see. He made maybe? Yeah. They made. So it's plural. They made his grave with the wicked,

44:07.560 --> 44:14.280
and with rich people his tomb. And if you remember, the Masoretic text has this strange plural

44:14.920 --> 44:22.120
with a rich man in his death's plural. And some people have really gotten off on that and talked

44:22.120 --> 44:28.440
to try to apply it to Jesus and say, well, maybe he survived the cross and then died later. So he

44:28.440 --> 44:35.080
has deaths, not death and all kinds of ideas people have come up with. But this just says,

44:35.080 --> 44:44.520
with rich people was his tomb. As he was buried in a tomb, or this person's buried in a tomb,

44:44.520 --> 44:50.120
I'm not talking about Jesus here, although he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth.

44:52.040 --> 44:58.760
Yet the Lord, and this is Yodhe Vavhe Hashem, but the Lord was willing to crush him,

44:59.320 --> 45:10.680
and he made him suffer. So I think, let's see, he made him suffer, MT. Right. That's,

45:11.640 --> 45:17.480
I'm not sure that, I don't have the MT open, so I'm not sure that that's not so significant for us

45:17.480 --> 45:24.680
right now. Now here's the one I think is most interesting, verse 11. You ready? Verse 11. When

45:24.680 --> 45:30.920
I first studied the Dead Sea Scrolls, I did a number of interviews. I remember Zola Levitt.

45:30.920 --> 45:36.600
Any of you remember Zola Levitt? Had that very popular TV program. He was very excited about

45:36.600 --> 45:43.160
this reading of the scroll. Because in the Dead Sea copy of the scrolls, it says,

45:43.800 --> 45:51.720
out of his suffering, his soul will see light. Out of his suffering, his soul will see light

45:52.680 --> 45:58.200
and find satisfaction. The idea of his soul seeing light

45:59.960 --> 46:06.120
is not in the Masoretic text. There's nothing like that. It just says he will see the suffering of

46:06.120 --> 46:13.320
his soul. But to see light or his very, very diffidence, very clear in the scrolls, what that

46:13.320 --> 46:20.760
would mean? It was interpreted probably by second temple groups that might have used a text like this

46:21.560 --> 46:26.440
to maybe mean resurrection. Because toward the end, it talks about him

46:29.240 --> 46:36.280
seeing his offspring and rejoicing and so forth and dividing the spoil. And so you could see how

46:36.280 --> 46:41.720
the Dead Sea Scroll group would think that their teacher, who they felt fulfilled this, the teacher

46:41.720 --> 46:47.640
of righteousness they called him, he was their leader, and they saw him as a kind of a new Moses.

46:48.200 --> 46:55.320
But they would feel that basically that this person maybe is going to suffer and be buried,

46:55.320 --> 47:02.360
but also see light. And I cover that in my lecture, Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return,

47:03.080 --> 47:06.680
because they expected him to return and he simply didn't.

47:09.400 --> 47:14.440
There's some other things. This book is nice because whenever there's a difference,

47:14.440 --> 47:21.240
it puts it in italics. And otherwise, it's the Masoretic Text. So it's really easy to use. And

47:21.240 --> 47:27.240
then you look down on the footnote and you see what the Masoretic Text had, what the Septuagint had,

47:27.240 --> 47:33.640
and what the Samaritan Pentateuch had. So Isaiah 53 is interesting. There's some differences that

47:33.640 --> 47:41.640
might be significant. Finally, and I think this one is really, really interesting, Malachi, the

47:41.640 --> 47:51.560
last of the Hebrew prophets, the famous passage in chapter three that is quoted in the New Testament

47:51.560 --> 47:59.000
and applied to John the Baptizer, I call him the Baptizer, Yocanon Hamat Ville, John the Dipper.

48:00.840 --> 48:08.680
I'll read it to you in the scroll version. You ready? Therefore, behold, I send my messenger

48:08.680 --> 48:15.640
and he will prepare the way before me and they will suddenly come to his temple, the Lord whom

48:15.640 --> 48:23.720
you seek and the messenger of the covenant whom you desire. Behold, he himself comes, says Hashem

48:23.720 --> 48:29.720
of hosts, the Lord of hosts, the Eternal of hosts, but who can endure them? They come,

48:30.840 --> 48:36.600
meaning when they come is the idea. Now, did you notice any difference in what you probably have,

48:36.600 --> 48:45.480
the Masoretic text? It looks like it's two figures, two messiahs. The Lord here is not the divine name

48:47.000 --> 48:52.840
when the Lord comes to his temple. That's Adon, L-O-R-D, the Lord, the master, the Adon of the

48:52.840 --> 48:59.320
earth, so to speak, could be a Messiah figure. So let me read it again. Therefore, I will send my

48:59.320 --> 49:06.440
messenger, that's one figure, he will prepare the way before me and they will suddenly come to

49:06.440 --> 49:13.960
his temple, the Lord whom you seek and the messenger of the covenant. This group believed in two

49:13.960 --> 49:20.440
messiahs. They believed in a priestly messiah, this Dead Sea Scroll group, and a Davidic messiah.

49:21.000 --> 49:28.520
So they believe that both messiahs were coming, and here you see two are talked about

49:28.520 --> 49:35.880
in the Dead Sea Scroll version of Malachi. And then, excuse me, let me get a little drink of water.

49:39.880 --> 49:45.400
Who can endure them when they come? Who can endure them when they come?

49:45.720 --> 49:56.520
Which is original? I'm just tempted to think that the plural is the more original because we have

49:56.520 --> 50:04.440
texts like Zachariah 6 that talks about the two messiahs. Earlier in Zachariah, with the two olive

50:04.440 --> 50:12.520
branches and the lamp stand, there are the two sons of fresh oil, one on the right and one on the left.

50:12.520 --> 50:19.160
And in Zachariah 6, you talk about the Davidic figure, the branch sitting on his throne,

50:20.040 --> 50:25.640
and then a priest standing by his side. So when you read the Dead Sea Scrolls, they believe in the

50:25.640 --> 50:34.040
coming of two messiahs. They talk about the coming of the messiahs of Israel and Aaron. Israel would

50:34.040 --> 50:41.400
be the messiah of Israel, the Davidic ruler, the king, and the messiah of Aaron would be the priest.

50:42.680 --> 50:49.240
So the Dead Sea Scroll group had three figures. I've written a lot about this. I've got articles

50:49.240 --> 50:55.560
about it. I've got an article on my blog called 123 messiahs question mark. So you can look that up

50:55.560 --> 51:02.440
jamestaber.com if you want to read more about that. But I'm thinking during the Second Temple period,

51:03.240 --> 51:09.400
there were expectations for three figures. If you go by the scrolls, here are the figures.

51:09.480 --> 51:16.040
A prophet like Moses, a kind of second Moses who would come, sort of middle figure. That would be

51:16.040 --> 51:23.320
the lampstand figure who's the adorn of the whole earth, the Lord of the whole earth. And he's able

51:23.320 --> 51:30.120
to inaugurate the new covenant. That was their view. And they believe that he had come, the teacher

51:30.120 --> 51:36.920
of righteousness. They say things about him that are quite extravagant. For example, they say to

51:36.920 --> 51:44.520
him, God has made known all the mysteries of the prophets, all the mysteries of the prophets. Amazing.

51:45.400 --> 51:51.400
And we have books like the Habakkuk Peshir. That was also cave one. And that one jar, one of the

51:51.400 --> 51:58.280
seven scrolls that was found. It's in the translation. You can read it. And it takes the Old Testament

51:58.280 --> 52:06.440
or Hebrew Bible book of Habakkuk and then interprets it verse by verse. But it sees it in the light of

52:06.440 --> 52:13.560
the history of the group, the Dead Sea Scroll Group, so that they actually apply it to their teacher.

52:14.200 --> 52:21.560
So the lecture I gave or the YouTube video I gave was a bar lecture, biblical archaeology,

52:21.560 --> 52:28.760
society lecture. Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return goes into that in great detail,

52:28.760 --> 52:38.040
so you can listen to that to get more details. But I'm thinking that essentially they're waiting,

52:38.600 --> 52:43.400
they have him, and then they're waiting for the two Messiahs. But I don't see any evidence in any

52:43.400 --> 52:48.840
of the scrolls that the two Messiahs ever showed up. And what happens is the teacher's killed.

52:49.960 --> 52:56.280
And on Yom Kippur, the priest, the wicked, he's called the wicked priest, because he's the priest

52:56.360 --> 53:02.120
they think is illegitimate, the priest in Jerusalem, probably one of the high priests that we know about.

53:02.840 --> 53:09.240
Depending on when you date the scrolls, it could go anywhere from the Maccabean period down to even

53:09.240 --> 53:18.120
into the first century. I tend to think the teacher thrived in the first century BC. But we have priests

53:18.760 --> 53:23.560
all the way through that period that are serving in the temple, and Josephus preserves their names.

53:23.560 --> 53:28.760
We have all the names of these priests during this period. Well, this group considers one of them

53:28.760 --> 53:34.760
a wicked priest, and he comes down on Yom Kippur. Now, here's a question. How could he travel on

53:34.760 --> 53:42.120
Yom Kippur to the desert community at Comronus? I mean, I'm assuming for now that Comronus is

53:42.120 --> 53:47.720
where the group was and where the teacher was. And some people would say there's no absolute

53:47.720 --> 53:52.520
evidence for that. But I think it's a good possibility. How would he come on Yom Kippur?

53:52.520 --> 53:57.960
Isn't the high priest in Jerusalem supposed to go into the temple on Yom Kippur? So he couldn't

53:57.960 --> 54:05.880
be traveling down and persecuting this teacher of Comron unless they're using a different calendar.

54:05.880 --> 54:12.600
And they are. Constantly on the scrolls, it says over and over again that I'm looking at my text

54:12.680 --> 54:22.440
messages. Sorry, getting buzzed, but it's just this, that, and the other. Constantly you read about

54:22.440 --> 54:30.600
the idea of the calendar being different in the days, months, seasons, and years being different

54:30.600 --> 54:36.680
because they're using a solar calendar. And it's a beautiful calendar. It's a very interesting calendar

54:36.760 --> 54:46.760
of, if you take a look at my YouTube lecture on my YouTube channel, it's called the Essene calendar

54:46.760 --> 54:51.960
made simple. Believe it or not, you can make it simple and you can even put it on a single page.

54:51.960 --> 54:57.560
I've got somewhere a page. I don't know if I have it right here, but I'm going to put it up on my

54:57.560 --> 55:03.560
blog with that lecture where you can see what kind of calendar they had. As far as I know,

55:04.520 --> 55:09.720
these two messiahs, though, didn't come. So the wicked priest, as his call came down and

55:09.720 --> 55:17.080
persecuted the teacher, it's possible the teacher was killed. Maybe we're not absolutely sure about

55:17.080 --> 55:22.920
that. And then the group decides that the end will come because remember it's an apocalyptic group.

55:22.920 --> 55:27.560
They think they're going to live to see the end just like the followers of Jesus. And it didn't

55:27.560 --> 55:32.520
come. And they say it's going to come in about 40 years. And then when 40 years passed, they,

55:33.160 --> 55:40.920
instead of losing their faith, they talk about God has prolonged the seasons, has prolonged the

55:40.920 --> 55:47.480
time. Very similar to the kind of thing you find, say, in Peter, I think, isn't it? Second Peter,

55:47.480 --> 55:51.880
God's long suffering. You know, he doesn't always do things according to what people thought.

55:52.760 --> 55:59.480
And they also conclude that all the times predicted by the book of Daniel have been

55:59.480 --> 56:07.480
fulfilled, but the end didn't come. Therefore, not that we're wrong, but, you know, that our

56:07.480 --> 56:12.120
interpretation is wrong, that they weren't fulfilled, because they haven't been fulfilled.

56:12.120 --> 56:18.600
They believe that God is giving more grace, more time, and it's going to be longer. And even though

56:18.600 --> 56:26.280
the date was right, God decided not to send the wrath and the judgment and the end of the age

56:27.080 --> 56:33.160
on time, which would have been 40 years after the death of the teacher. How did they come up

56:33.160 --> 56:40.600
with that 40 years? They believe there's a final cycle of 10 jubilees, 49-year jubilees, 490 years.

56:41.480 --> 56:50.280
They interpret Daniel 9, the so-called 70 weeks prophecy, and they've placed their teacher in the

56:50.280 --> 56:59.640
10th week. And then they begin to talk about in the final 49-year period, everything will come,

56:59.640 --> 57:05.560
and then it didn't come. It didn't happen. And so they're basically disappointed. And they decide

57:06.760 --> 57:14.360
that God has decided to prolong the days. How long did the movement last? It's hard to know,

57:14.360 --> 57:20.520
but given this flexibility with the text of Habakkuk, I think we could presume that they went

57:20.520 --> 57:26.680
into the first century. I would think some of the followers of John the Baptist and Jesus might have

57:26.680 --> 57:32.920
had grandparents and parents that had known the teacher and maybe were kind of part of that general

57:32.920 --> 57:40.600
Messianic movement. Eisman calls it the Messianic movement of Palestine. He uses the term Palestine,

57:40.680 --> 57:47.240
which the scholars use to describe the Holy Land, but the Messianic movement of the land of Israel.

57:48.040 --> 57:55.800
And I would say that there are probably remnants of that, because if you look at the Jesus movement,

57:55.800 --> 58:02.440
there's just, as I mentioned, a lot of parallels. Not only the apocalyptic wilderness, new covenant

58:02.440 --> 58:11.080
kind of thing, but also the idea of sacred meals, a bread and wine that you couldn't partake of.

58:11.080 --> 58:17.240
It's called the pure meal of the saints, the specified ones. They're very separationist

58:18.440 --> 58:26.520
in terms of their piety and their idea. They have a council of 12 and an inner council of three.

58:26.520 --> 58:33.080
Does that remind you of anything? And yet the Jesus movement is very, very different from what

58:33.080 --> 58:39.880
you read in the scrolls in terms of interpreting the Torah. The best example in this lecture is not

58:39.880 --> 58:43.960
on that, but I want to kind of close with this, where you get a feeling of what they're all about.

58:45.480 --> 58:51.000
In the scrolls, it says that if a beast or animal falls into a pit on the Sabbath,

58:51.000 --> 58:57.160
you must not help the animal out, because it's the Sabbath. And there's a command in the Sabbath

58:57.160 --> 59:02.520
that you stay in your dwelling. And they took that very literally. Literally, you don't leave the camp.

59:04.120 --> 59:11.240
By the way, latrines, they don't even go outside the camp on the Sabbath to go to the toilet.

59:11.960 --> 59:16.840
Josephus mentions that about the Essenes. He presents it as something admirable,

59:17.480 --> 59:22.840
like, wow, they're so dedicated. They go for 24 hours without going to the toilet.

59:23.640 --> 59:30.040
And some of you know that Josephus and I, a few years ago, we think we discovered the latrines

59:30.040 --> 59:37.480
that come run exactly as the scrolls describe northwest of the camp, 1,000 cubits to 2,000

59:37.480 --> 59:45.720
cubits away from the camp, hidden from view, is the area where we did soil samples and we think we

59:45.720 --> 59:53.800
located their latrines. There's a cemetery nearby with over 1,100 graves, mostly male,

59:53.800 --> 59:57.160
and there's some dispute about the female, because there are a few women,

59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.840
and they haven't all been excavated just to sample. But Zias thinks that the women are

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:08.840
later burials of veteran women. They just took advantage of a local cemetery. They're not ancient.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:17.880
But by far, most of them are men, and therefore possibly come run as a celibate community.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:23.160
So you do get these parallels, which also get differences. Jesus says, I think it's in Luke,

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:29.240
which of you would not take a beast out of a pit on the Sabbath, as if to say,

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:35.400
anybody would do that. And believe me, you know, this picking grain on the Sabbath story that's

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:42.760
in Mark chapter 2 and Matthew chapter 12, where the disciples picked grain. The scrolls specifically

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:49.400
say that you must prepare your meals before the Sabbath. That's in the Torah, right? So you can,

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:55.160
that's considered, you didn't prepare that before the Sabbath. Also, it's threshing or harvesting,

01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:00.600
which is forbidden on the Sabbath. So they, the scroll people back in the days of the teacher

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:07.240
in the time when these things were written, the sectarian scrolls, they would just be appalled

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:15.000
that the disciples of Jesus are harvesting barley and popping the grain in their mouth when

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.800
they're famished. And if you remember, the response of Jesus was not like, oh, well, sorry, we broke

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.920
the law, but it was basically like, well, you know, the Sabbath's made for people, not people for the

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:33.800
Sabbath. So the idea of being humane to an animal or taking care of human need on the Sabbath,

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:40.280
which the Pharisees also taught, and they made certain allowances to allow you to keep the

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:46.280
Sabbath in less of a strict way. Whereas the carites later did not. And I'd have to check with

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:53.160
Namia Gordon to see today how they're defining the dwelling. Because if you can't go out of your

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.200
house during the Sabbath, you're dwelling. Does that mean your literal house you live in,

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:05.000
like the rooms you inhabit or apartment? Or does it mean your town? Or does it mean your city?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.040
If you're in a large city, all these things are interpreted differently by Judaism over the years.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:17.640
Some of you might know there is around the city of Jerusalem today a wire or thread like

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:25.160
element upon poles all the way around the city. And that the rabbis define Jerusalem as the dwelling

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.720
of the people in Jerusalem. So you don't go out of your dwelling, meaning you don't go out of the

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:34.280
city of Jerusalem, but you can go anywhere in the city of Jerusalem. This group would have been

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:41.000
horrified at any of those kinds of interpretations. I think they would have been very upset with Jesus

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:47.960
for any number of things that he did. So I don't think Jesus is part of this.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:54.040
Some people think John the Baptist is and they try to make him really rigid and conservative.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.400
But you know, the only traditions we have of John the Baptist, he's actually pretty accommodating.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:06.760
He talks to Roman soldiers. He talks to tax collectors and blesses them and says,

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.960
you're fine. You can come in the movement. Of course, everybody has to repent. But I mean,

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:19.640
he seems like he's more accepting. I would put John the Baptist Jesus and James sort of on a plane,

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.920
even though they might have had some differences. So this is an election on the Jesus movement,

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:31.640
but because it's another parallel second temple, apocalyptic movement of the time I want to mention

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.920
it. So they're taking both movements, the Jesus movement and the Dead Sea Scroll movement.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:43.480
They're reading these texts and we have to wonder what version. We know the Qumran group

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:50.440
was reading the version that we just studied, but is there evidence that in the New Testament that

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:57.160
some of the texts that were being quoted were actually, they're quoting more the Septuagint or

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:03.320
the Dead Sea Scrolls and the answer is yes. That's why some of the readings differ quite a bit,

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:07.800
because they're quoting a different version. They're not just changing the Bible they're using.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.000
I guess you could say a different text of that particular book of the Bible.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:18.120
So I hope that has been interesting to you. You'll get the Dead Sea Scroll Bible, delve into it.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:25.000
I'm particularly excited about what Ross will be able to uncover in looking at all the scrolls of

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.720
Deuteronomy from the Dead Sea's collection and comparing them to the Shapira Scroll.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:39.320
As I said earlier, that could be quite telling because Shapira would not have known

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:45.640
these versions of Deuteronomy in Hebrew if there are parallels and we've already seen a couple.

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:52.440
Then how would he have forged the document and made up readings that are later going to be discovered

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:59.640
in 1947 in caves? But remember he found the Moses Scroll in a cave wrapped in land with

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:07.640
the sticky residue around it. It sounds kind of like the discovery of the Qumran Scrolls.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:14.680
So some of you are going on the trip with us in October and we'll do other trips as well in the

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:19.720
future if you can't make this one. But one of the things we're going to do is stay in the desert

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:25.160
for three nights I think and we're going to visit Qumran and we're going to visit Masada and we're

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:32.360
going to walk around these caves and it's going to be very exciting. Dead Sea Scroll news breaks

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:37.640
all the time like that Esther Scroll discovery that I just told you about. During the time I've

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:43.400
been teaching my Dead Sea Scroll class this semester we've had several major news stories on the

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:51.320
Dead Sea Scrolls break. So it's really an exciting field to be in. I'm really really interested

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:57.000
and fascinated with the Dead Sea Scrolls. I've studied them for years and I hope this will

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:13.240
encourage all of you to study them too. So Shabbat Shalom and wish you all well.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:25.240
Thank you.
