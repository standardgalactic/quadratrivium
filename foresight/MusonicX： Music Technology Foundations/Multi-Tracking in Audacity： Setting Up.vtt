This week we will be looking at the creative practice of sequencing sound using our digital

00:11.280 --> 00:13.180
audio workstation.

00:13.180 --> 00:17.160
This will allow you to order your musical events over time whilst layering and blending

00:17.160 --> 00:20.680
them together to realise your creative project.

00:20.680 --> 00:27.680
The key concepts we will explore are time, sequencing, tracks and channels, volume, panning

00:27.680 --> 00:28.680
and effects.

00:29.200 --> 00:35.840
The first thing I need to do is create, set up and save a project file.

00:35.840 --> 00:39.800
So I will go file, new.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.080
It brings up the familiar project window.

00:42.080 --> 00:47.480
Note, we have used this window before, but before we used it simply to edit, process,

00:47.480 --> 00:49.640
manipulate and export audio.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.680
We never actually saved a project.

00:51.680 --> 00:55.440
This time we are going to save a project file which contains all the various settings

00:55.440 --> 00:58.800
and media that we need to use.

00:58.800 --> 01:11.080
I will go file, save project as, give it a name and click save.

01:11.080 --> 01:16.280
The next thing I need to do is ensure Audacity has the correct settings that I wish to use

01:16.280 --> 01:17.760
for sequencing.

01:17.760 --> 01:26.600
To do this I go to Audacity, Preferences, Quality and make sure it is 48,024 bit.

01:26.600 --> 01:32.680
It is a bit higher than probably what we need, but it will ensure the quality is good.

01:32.680 --> 01:37.440
The other thing I need to do is ensure the tracks are set up to edit in a particular

01:37.440 --> 01:38.440
way.

01:38.440 --> 01:43.480
One of the things that is useful is ensuring when you are sequencing that the various events

01:43.480 --> 01:48.440
or clips don't move about when we edit, add and modify.

01:48.440 --> 01:55.200
So I am going to uncheck this option here, editing a clip can move other clips.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.960
Click OK and we are done.
