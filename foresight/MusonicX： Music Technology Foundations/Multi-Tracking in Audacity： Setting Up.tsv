0	11280	This week we will be looking at the creative practice of sequencing sound using our digital
11280	13180	audio workstation.
13180	17160	This will allow you to order your musical events over time whilst layering and blending
17160	20680	them together to realise your creative project.
20680	27680	The key concepts we will explore are time, sequencing, tracks and channels, volume, panning
27680	28680	and effects.
29200	35840	The first thing I need to do is create, set up and save a project file.
35840	39800	So I will go file, new.
39800	42080	It brings up the familiar project window.
42080	47480	Note, we have used this window before, but before we used it simply to edit, process,
47480	49640	manipulate and export audio.
49640	51680	We never actually saved a project.
51680	55440	This time we are going to save a project file which contains all the various settings
55440	58800	and media that we need to use.
58800	71080	I will go file, save project as, give it a name and click save.
71080	76280	The next thing I need to do is ensure Audacity has the correct settings that I wish to use
76280	77760	for sequencing.
77760	86600	To do this I go to Audacity, Preferences, Quality and make sure it is 48,024 bit.
86600	92680	It is a bit higher than probably what we need, but it will ensure the quality is good.
92680	97440	The other thing I need to do is ensure the tracks are set up to edit in a particular
97440	98440	way.
98440	103480	One of the things that is useful is ensuring when you are sequencing that the various events
103480	108440	or clips don't move about when we edit, add and modify.
108440	115200	So I am going to uncheck this option here, editing a clip can move other clips.
115200	117960	Click OK and we are done.
