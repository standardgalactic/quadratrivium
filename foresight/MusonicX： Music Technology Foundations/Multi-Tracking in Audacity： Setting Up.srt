00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280
This week we will be looking at the creative practice of sequencing sound using our digital

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,180
audio workstation.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,160
This will allow you to order your musical events over time whilst layering and blending

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,680
them together to realise your creative project.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,680
The key concepts we will explore are time, sequencing, tracks and channels, volume, panning

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,680
and effects.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,840
The first thing I need to do is create, set up and save a project file.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,800
So I will go file, new.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,080
It brings up the familiar project window.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,480
Note, we have used this window before, but before we used it simply to edit, process,

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,640
manipulate and export audio.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,680
We never actually saved a project.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,440
This time we are going to save a project file which contains all the various settings

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,800
and media that we need to use.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:11,080
I will go file, save project as, give it a name and click save.

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,280
The next thing I need to do is ensure Audacity has the correct settings that I wish to use

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,760
for sequencing.

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:26,600
To do this I go to Audacity, Preferences, Quality and make sure it is 48,024 bit.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,680
It is a bit higher than probably what we need, but it will ensure the quality is good.

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,440
The other thing I need to do is ensure the tracks are set up to edit in a particular

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
way.

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,480
One of the things that is useful is ensuring when you are sequencing that the various events

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,440
or clips don't move about when we edit, add and modify.

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:55,200
So I am going to uncheck this option here, editing a clip can move other clips.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,960
Click OK and we are done.
