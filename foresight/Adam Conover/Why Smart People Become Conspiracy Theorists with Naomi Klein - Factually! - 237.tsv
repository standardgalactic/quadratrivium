0	4480	Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.
4480	10560	This week, I want to talk about an experience that is both weird and weirdly common in 2023 in
10560	14720	the past couple years. You've probably seen it happen to someone around you. Maybe it was a roommate,
14720	19920	a parent, a family friend, or for me, some comedians I started out with. Whoever it was,
19920	26320	the story is the same. Someone who seemed sane with it and living in the same reality as you did
26320	33280	suddenly lost their mind and went down some rabbit hole to emerge as a fully blown conspiracy
33280	39200	theorist. Now, people have been losing their shit like this from time immemorial. As I've covered
39200	44400	before on this show and on Adam ruins everything, conspiratorial thinking follows from the normal
44400	49920	patterns of human thought that we use to understand the world around us. But it seems that there's
49920	55520	something particular and special about the way that people fall into the trap of conspiratorial
55520	62400	thinking now. Whether it starts on 4chan or Fox News, anti-vaxx or QAnon, there's a mirror world
62400	68560	of socially poisonous conspiracy that people keep falling into. It is incredibly painful when it
68560	74080	happens to someone who you know and love and it's often hard to know how to even understand what
74080	81280	happened. What is it about our world, our media, and our politics today that makes this happen
81360	88320	over and over again, the reasonable people who we love and care about? Well, today I have a truly
88320	94080	brilliant guest to help dig into this issue and into the entire mirror world that our politics
94080	98000	and media ecosystem has become. But before we get into it, I just want to remind you that if you
98000	103200	want to support this show, you can do so on Patreon. Head to patreon.com slash Adam Conover.

111360	115200	And by the way, if you like stand-up comedy, just want to remind you I am a touring stand-up
115200	120400	comedian. I just put a whole bunch of new dates up on my website. In 2024, I am heading to New
120400	126480	York, Boston, Philly, D.C., Portland, Maine, a bunch of other places, Chicago, Nashville,
126480	133040	head to adamconover.net for tickets and tour dates. And now let's get to today's guest because she is
133040	137520	incredible. She's one of the most respected and influential public intellectuals and
137520	143680	nonfiction authors on the left of the past century. Her writings on consumerism, capitalism,
143680	148320	and climate are required reading. And her most recent book is called doppelganger,
148320	153280	a trip into the mirror world. I am, of course, talking about the incredible Naomi Klein and her
153280	158880	new book is a fascinating and personal look into the conspiratorial ways of thinking that are thriving
158880	162880	in the moment we live in today. So without further ado, please welcome Naomi Klein.
165760	169760	Naomi, thank you so much for being on the show. It's a complete thrill to have you.
169760	174880	I'm very happy to be with you. Your books, every time one comes out, they make waves
174880	180800	every single time. This new one, I am so excited about having read the introduction of the first
180800	187120	chapter. It's immediately gripping. You do something that is a form of thinking and communicating
187120	191360	that is very close to my heart. Always interesting to me where you start from
191360	197040	a fascinating personal story and you ladder out from that to a really wide ranging discussion of
197040	201440	the world that we live in today and some really fascinating intellectual issues. It's so cool.
202400	206240	Let's start from the starting point. The book's called doppelganger. Please tell us about your
206240	213200	doppelganger and how it led you on this investigation. Sure. So I do have a doppelganger
214000	219680	by which I mean a person who I am perennially confused and conflated with. Lots of us
219680	225680	have had this experience. I would say mine is more extreme than most. There is another Naomi
225680	234080	nonfiction writer of books who is close to my age and I don't know. We're both Jewish. We're both
234080	243440	named Naomi and we both write books and sort of big ideas, I suppose. You're both cultural critics
243440	249680	as well. Yeah. Her first book, I'm referring to Naomi Wolfe and so lots of viewers, listeners
249680	255920	and viewers might not be familiar with her. She was big in the 90s. She wrote a book called
255920	261440	The Beauty Myth. She worked for Al Gore when he ran for president. She was one of the most
261520	266560	prominent feminists of her generation. She used to be more on the liberal left.
268640	272640	This is why it became a little awkward for me to be confused with her. Now she pales around
272640	277200	with Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson and was a real vector of medical misinformation
277760	288400	during the COVID-19 pandemic. I use her as a case study. We all know people who changed a lot
288400	292720	during COVID. We all know people who we've scratched our heads and gone like, what happened
292720	298320	to that person? Maybe it's like a public figure or maybe it's like a brother or a sister or a
298320	306000	yoga instructor who suddenly is talking about QAnon. I use this experience of identity confusion
306000	310080	because during the pandemic, I would go online and just there would be thousands of people
311040	320960	really angry at me about things that I hadn't done. Because they saw a Naomi on TV saying
320960	324800	something who looks, I mean, if you were next to each other, I could tell the difference,
324800	328080	but if someone hasn't looked at you for a couple years and they see the other,
328080	333600	oh, Brunette, et cetera, same age, et cetera. I always say she has much better hair than me.
334160	336480	It's really important to know.
336480	341120	So people are actually misattributing. Naomi Wolfe was out there saying sometimes horrible
341120	344480	things and they were saying Naomi Klein said this and getting mad at you.
344480	349280	Yeah. Like why is Naomi Klein saying that unvaccinated people have to stay away from
349280	353920	vaccinated people because they might shed vaccine particles onto them and then not be able to have
353920	361680	babies? Things like that. So in the book, I use this identity confusion, which all of us who
361840	367280	have something of a public platform, I think the pandemic had a particular kind of vertigo
367280	373440	because we are used to being in rooms full of other people who help tell us who we are.
373440	377680	Right? Like the last thing, I canceled a book tour. I canceled all these public events.
378240	385600	And so I think that, I think generally we're confused about what our social media avatars are.
385600	393920	Like is that us? Is that really you? It's a sort of an approximation of you.
393920	398640	Like it's a character version of you. It's a branded version of you.
399840	406800	And so I think that I didn't like being confused with her because she was saying a lot of
406800	411360	strange and dangerous things during COVID. But I also think that I was very confused about who
411360	417280	I was during COVID because I wasn't able to do the things that tell me who I am a lot of the time.
417280	424240	Right? So I used it as this kind of portal to get into the weirdness of how we are represented
424240	429280	to the world through our avatars, whether we really believe that each other are real when we
429280	435600	just see these avatar versions of one another. And in a way, that's like she is my doppelganger,
435600	442240	but so is my Twitter avatar. Like that's not really me, whoever that person is performing me on
442240	448320	Twitter. So I think we live in a doppelganger world, especially with AI, where we're not really
448320	456080	sure who and what is real. And so she is a, you know, I guess a kind of a literary device to get
456080	460480	at this hall of mirrors that is contemporary culture. And as soon as you start talking about
460480	468000	that, the number of doppelgangers like starts multiplying in my head because you talk about,
468000	473120	yeah, do you understand yourself, that Twitter avatar as part of you, there's these sort of
473680	478320	strange loss of your own identity you feel when someone confuses you with another person,
478320	482080	you know, when someone, whenever someone says that person looks like you, I'm like,
482080	486880	that's what you think I look like. It's not what I think I look like. Like it's destabilizing just
486880	493200	to be mistaken for another person. In fact, I was once told, I told, this happened to me in
493200	497760	comedy 10 years ago, I told a comic I ran into that she looked like another comic and she said,
497760	504320	no, I don't. And then she said, you should never tell anyone that they look like another person,
504320	508160	because you don't know what the person you're talking to thinks they look like, you know,
508160	512320	you don't know what their self image is and you could be violating their self image in a deep way.
512320	516240	And I always took that to heart and I no longer do that. I no longer say, oh, you kind of look
516240	520800	like this other person because you might be triggering some insecurity the person has or whatever.
521440	525920	It can be very destabilizing to be compared to another person out there.
526400	531360	But, you know, in the end, I decided to embrace it as an unconventional form of,
532640	538480	you know, sort of Zen non-attachment. Because, you know, we live in a culture that is constantly
538480	543520	telling us that we need to perform this perfected version of ourselves and optimize ourselves.
543600	548960	And it's like, you know, it's a kind of our life raft in these extremely competitive waters.
548960	555040	And there's something sort of liberating about realizing that no matter how carefully you tend
555040	561120	to your personal brand and project yourself with the exact right caliber of irony and earnestness,
562160	567680	if thousands of people think that you are somebody totally different, it really is just
567680	575040	telling you like get over yourself, you know. And so I've decided to be grateful for my doppelganger
575040	584400	and to take it as a message to just find other people, find the others, invest in community,
585440	589680	not in personal perfection because people are going to think that you think wild things no
589680	593280	matter what you do. I feel like you've given us the beautiful conclusion of this book at the
593280	597440	beginning of the interview. So maybe we should bleep it for spoilers. I don't know. That's
597440	603440	wonderful. But let's keep exploring. Something else that you said that made me think is, you know,
603440	608640	when our online avatars are those us, are people seeing us when they're looking at us,
608640	614000	that makes me think that when people, you know, lose that screw like Naomi Wolfe did when the
614000	618080	person goes QAnon, when they go anti-vax, when our friend starts behaving in this bizarre way
618880	622960	and starts accusing us of being involved in a conspiracy or seeing those around them,
622960	628080	it often is. Or being a doppelganger of yourself, like stepped for people and stuff.
628080	634240	Yes. Oh, you're not you anymore and they turn it away on you. Well, the pain of that is often
634240	640480	that we no longer feel seen by our friend. The person somehow loses their ability to see us and
640480	645280	to see, you know, when people are really going nuts on Twitter and accusing each other of being,
645280	649760	you know, whatever, vaccine propagandist or whatever, they're not seeing the people they're
649760	654320	talking to as people anymore. And we sort of, it seems like a very modern thing to lose our
654320	660560	ability to see each other as human beings. Yeah. And I mean, it's, it's weird enough when it's
660560	666800	somebody who you don't know, who clearly has you completely wrong. But what's weird as you're saying,
666800	671840	and it's like, when it's somebody who does know you and is suddenly treating you like this,
672480	680560	like entirely two dimensional form. Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of relationships were severed
680560	686240	during during COVID because we were all really stressed out and we were confused. We were anxious.
686880	693040	And so people were disinvited from family dinners and, you know, often for good reasons, you know,
693040	699600	they are immunocompromised and, you know, like, like if you had immunocompromised people in your
699600	704400	family, then you, and you had somebody who was not taking COVID seriously at all, you know,
704400	710240	that's going to create a rift and it created rifts and countless families. But I've also heard some
710240	716000	really nice stories since the book came out of people who, who said that they reached back out
716000	722560	to a sister they lost touch with or, you know, another family member and realized that, you know,
722560	726080	they didn't want to have all these severed connections. And maybe there, there are some
726160	731520	things that they agree on. Maybe they, maybe, maybe you don't like big pharma either for different
731520	736640	reasons, but you might be able to find some common ground and maybe pull them back from what I call
736640	744880	the mirror world. Because, yeah, there's often a, like, you know, I write that conspiracy culture
744880	750640	often gets the facts wrong, but the feelings right. And there's a, there's a way in which there's
750640	757840	always a little bit of truth mixed in with the fantasy in any of the conspiracies. So,
758720	763040	you know, you've got to extend some kind of a bridge where you find, maybe you find some common
763040	767280	ground and give somebody an out because they might be looking for an out. There's a lot of
767280	772160	grifters in there. The fact that you call it the mirror world is just, again, such an evocative
772160	780160	image you found to, that really makes me think about it differently. What, so let's talk about
780160	785920	what is it, do you think that pulls people into that mirror world? Because it's happened with a
785920	792000	lot of events. I saw it happen a friend of mine after 2016, after the pandemic. You know, it seems
792000	797520	like there are these inciting events. And what is it that, that causes this to happen to people?
798240	803360	So I think human beings are creatures of narrative. We like to have stories that,
803360	811680	that tell us who we are and, and where we are. And, and when you have a shock, like a major event
811680	818560	that, that, that scrambles the story of who you thought you were, like 9-11, like a lot of Americans
819280	824080	had no idea who these people were. And that was, that was the question like, why do they hate us?
824080	832480	Like, what is this? You know, we don't do a very good job of teaching what people like geopolitics
832480	837840	in high school, let alone university. So when it turns out that there's like people on the other
837840	843360	side of the planet who are very angry at your country and you, you never learned why, like you
843360	850560	never learned, you didn't even know they were there, right? But after 9-11, I, I wrote a piece,
850560	855120	I remember, I think it was for the LA Times saying, you know, Americans woke up to realize
855120	860960	they were, that they were at war only to find that they had been at war for a long time and no one
860960	869920	told them, you know? So, so I think that we go looking for stories when, when, when our stories
869920	875200	of self fall apart. And, and, and like, I don't know about you, but I've never lived through a
875200	881440	global pandemic before. I've never been told to stay home for months before. This was new terrain.
881440	886720	I've never looked up at the sky and not seen planes of Times Square empty. I mean, these were
886720	893200	shocking events. And so as creatures of story, we go looking for them. And I think what really
893200	899040	derailed us during COVID is that, that search for story intersected with an attention economy.
899040	902240	And it's an economy that means that whoever has the most outrageous
902880	908080	over-claiming story wins the clicks, wins the eyeballs. You know, science takes time.
908080	913280	We were confronting a novel virus. And you had all these scientists saying like, okay, be patient.
913280	917120	We have to go do our research and then we'll get back to you. And then you had a whole bunch of
917120	923840	grifters just rush into that gap saying, we have the story we know come over here. And, you know,
923840	927840	often they were dusting off theories that they had been using in different contexts,
927840	934560	like the anti-vax movement, right? Like they had been spinning stories about childhood vaccines
934560	941680	and autism, which were lies before COVID. But they just needed to kind of do a search and replace
942400	947200	on the COVID vaccines. And they were good to go. Like they didn't have to, you know, so anyway,
947200	952000	so that's some of it. Why do you call, how did you come up with the term the mirror world? And
952000	957360	why do you think of the conspiracy theory world as being a mirror? Well, I was struck, you know,
957360	963440	so I, like, I use my doppelganger as sort of my white rabbit, like in Alice in Wonderland,
963440	969040	to fall down the rabbit hole and really explore the world that she is in now. Because it was either
969040	975840	going to be like, just be horrified by everything she was saying, or, or actually try to understand
975840	981920	like how she could have changed so much. And I'm a researcher. And this is how I understand the
981920	989120	world. Like, you know, when something confounds me, I try to understand it. And so, so I started
989120	994960	listening to a lot of the interviews she was doing with people like Steve Bannon. She was on
994960	1000320	his show almost every day for a while. So I listened to hundreds of hours of Steve Bannon's
1000320	1006560	podcast, The War Room. Wow. And, you know, she was also on like many lesser known.
1006560	1010240	Did you start to like the podcast after a while? Or are you like, okay, these are like my buddies
1010320	1017920	now. You get a parasocial relationship with Steve? I admit that I got his theme song
1017920	1025760	stuck in my head, which is like pretty catchy. It's a very weird anti-China theme song.
1030000	1036160	But it does end with like, let's take down the CCP. And that's when I knew I was in trouble.
1036880	1041520	When I just was like, couldn't get it out of my brain when I was doing, you know, unloading the
1041520	1049600	dishwasher. So, so, but, but I like, I call it the mirror world because I was really struck,
1049600	1056080	particularly listening to Bannon. One time it was, it was, I remember it was Christmas 2021.
1056080	1066720	And he was shilling a new coin called FJB, like fuck Joe Biden. And he was just trying to
1066720	1070800	fleece people before Christmas. He was like, get this for your relatives. And he was making
1070800	1076160	this whole pitch about how you couldn't trust the dollar anymore. So you had to buy these coins and
1076160	1081120	so on. Is this cryptocurrency? It wasn't exactly, it was even like, not even crypto. It was just
1081200	1086560	like literally a coin that said fuck Joe Biden. Like just, like just we made a little, a little
1086560	1092800	piece of metal disc that says FJB on it. Which is why I say you might be able to get some friends
1092800	1096800	and family members back from the mirror world because there are so many drifters there, right?
1096800	1102560	That they might be looking for some kind of help. It's so they're getting fleeced non-stop, right?
1103680	1110720	Right. You know, send that lifeline, see what happens. But, but as he was making his pitch,
1111600	1116480	his pre-Christmas pitch, he was saying, you know, we need to have, this is why we need to have our
1116480	1121680	own money and we need to have our own publishing companies and we need to have our own social
1121680	1127920	media platforms because we will never cancel you. We will never other you. You'll always be welcome
1127920	1134960	here. And so, and he was really talking about a one to one, like, you know, get kicked off Twitter,
1134960	1140160	you can join Getter, which they call themselves the Twitter killer. You know, get kicked off
1140160	1145920	YouTube, you can join Rumble and so on. And there was, there was like an exact mirror of everything,
1145920	1151520	like in the world that I lived in. And I was just really struck that most of the people who I know
1151520	1156880	and hang out with have no idea this world like fully exists. And they actually think that when
1156880	1161200	somebody gets kicked off the social media that site that they're on that they almost like have been
1161200	1167040	deleted from planet Earth. And it's so strangely arrogant because actually they're really good
1167120	1173600	at this. And they are building massive platforms and they're reaching lots of people. And, and
1173600	1177600	that's, you know, that's why I pay attention to them. They're a major political force, you know.
1177600	1180320	Steve Bannon is a strategist. He's trying to get back into power.
1181040	1184640	And these are happening on the public internet. They're not, it's not the dark web. It's like,
1184640	1190720	you can just go to these websites and look at this stuff. How do you, you know, I know you
1190720	1196560	tracked Naomi Wolf's progress through the book. How did she fall into this? Because it's, it's a very
1197440	1201600	even if it weren't for the connection to you, it's a very strange story.
1201600	1207840	Yeah, it's a strange story because she was such a prominent liberal, such a prominent Democrat,
1207840	1215120	feminist. How did she fall into it? You know, I have an, I have an equation in the book that might
1215120	1221440	be useful because I think there's a lot of people who have, who have changed as we, as discussed,
1222240	1233520	which is social media slash grandiosity plus social media addiction. Many of, I think pretty
1233520	1242880	much anybody who we might be thinking of spends way too much time online. And plus midlife crisis
1244880	1250960	divided by public shaming equals right wing meltdown. So I want to talk a bit about the
1250960	1255680	public shaving piece of it because I, you know, I think one of the big drivers for her is that
1255680	1263600	she's one of these people who became a spectacle for liberal left Twitter. And that's because she
1263600	1269520	made a foundational error in a book that she published in 2019. And this error was discovered
1269520	1276080	live on BBC radio. It's every writer's worst nightmare. I mean, I, I sort of remember this
1276080	1280000	as a viral moment. And I didn't, I honestly did not really know who she was or really follow her
1280000	1284000	that much, but I, I sort of remember this. What was the error that was discovered?
1284000	1289920	So she wrote a book called Outrageous. It came out, you know, a few months before the pandemic.
1291040	1298000	And it was a, it was a, it was a historical work. It was actually her PhD thesis. And it told,
1300480	1307680	what she, during this interview, she, she made this claim that gay men had been executed
1308560	1315920	for sodomy long after it was like people thought that they stopped sentencing people to death
1315920	1322400	for being gay. And what happened in the BBC interviewer pointed out that she had misread
1322400	1327520	the historical record. And he said, like in a very polite British way, like, it's just the
1327520	1331520	thing is, is that I think you misunderstood. And then he explained that, and then the bottom
1331520	1337120	falls out of her entire book. And she, and it turns out that those men had actually been released.
1338080	1345040	She misunderstood a term called death recorded, which is what she thought was a death sentence,
1345040	1351840	but it isn't. And so that was just a journalist doing his job. You know, he fact-checked a book
1351840	1355440	that should have been fact-checked by the author and the publisher and found a massive error.
1356080	1363840	But then she becomes a meme, you know, then, then people just cannot get enough of this.
1364800	1368640	And why does she become a meme? Because the, you know, this sounds like
1369360	1372640	an error is an error. That's embarrassing. Maybe people have a little bit of fun,
1372640	1376080	but there has to be something deeper going on for people to really go in on that.
1376080	1384320	You know, I think not really. I mean, I think she was, she was, she was enough of a big deal,
1385200	1387920	you know, enough of a, you know, New York Times bestselling author
1388880	1394720	that to watch this happen live on the air. It was just one of those moments where,
1394720	1398560	because it would be your worst nightmare, and there's a lot of writers on Twitter,
1398560	1402880	the idea that you could point and laugh at it happening to somebody else somehow made you feel
1402880	1410160	safer. And, but also she had been dabbling in conspiracy culture, you know, before that,
1410160	1415280	you know, she had made, she did things like they took pictures of clouds and speculated about
1415280	1422000	government, you know, yeah, you know, chemtrails and things like that. You know,
1422000	1427680	she was a bit of a cloud truther. She's, you know, just a little, just a little spot of cloud
1427680	1431600	truth, just like you're hanging out with her and she might go, Hey, clouds are fake, you know,
1431600	1435120	and you're like, Oh, well, that was weird that Naomi just sort of tossed that on me. But other
1435120	1438800	than that, she's pretty nice. Just a bit of a cloud truth of truth. I mean, I think she thinks
1438800	1447520	birds are real. I'm not sure. So, so, but because there was a little bit of a reservoir of annoyance
1447520	1451520	with her already online, because she was dabbling in other conspiracy theories, that's why people,
1451520	1456560	part of why people really went in, it sounds like. Yeah. And then during COVID, I think she was,
1456560	1463120	we were all bored and at home, and she was like, just endlessly sharing wild theories, like, you
1463120	1468320	know, like she, she'd, you'd log online and you know, she had like, you know, almost 200,000
1468320	1473280	followers, you know, it's not like she's like, it didn't have reach. She has many more now.
1474320	1479200	But she, you know, she'd say that she thinks that children were losing the ability to smile
1479200	1483120	because they were wearing masks, you know, and then that would be days of entertainment,
1483120	1489360	things like that. You know, there was a lot about vaccine shedding onto unvaccinated people.
1489760	1497200	And I mean, but, but I call her a conspiracy influencer, not a conspiracy theorist, because
1497200	1504160	there are often these glaring contradictions in the claims. Like, you know, for a while, she was
1504160	1514400	talking about how COVID was a bot, maybe had been cooked up as a bio weapon. But then she was like,
1514480	1519120	but why wear masks? You know, like, and it's just, it just seems like a bit of a contradiction
1519120	1525840	there. Like, you know, if it's a bio weapon, surely you should try not to, not to get it, you
1525840	1532720	know, she's like, so she's an influence. You should be worried about it. Contradicts the
1532720	1538480	idea that it's not that big a deal. Yeah. So the, the, the story is constantly changing with whatever
1538480	1542240	is going to get more clicks. So if everyone's supposed to get vaccinated, now the vaccines
1542240	1546320	are a bio weapon. If everyone's supposed to get an app on their phone to see if they got
1546320	1550000	vaccinated, well, it's not about the vaccine. It's the app. The app can listen to your phone
1550000	1555600	conversations and things like that. But this is what I mean about how they often get the feeling
1555600	1560720	right and the facts wrong is that, you know, that's where she really took a star turn on the right
1560720	1566320	was when she started talking about those vaccine verification apps, being a covert surveillance
1567040	1575680	plan. So the truth is like, like people are very anxious about surveillance. They're very anxious
1575680	1579600	about what happens with their data. They're anxious about their cell phones. They don't really
1579600	1584480	under, we don't really understand, you know, what is known about our movements, you know,
1585520	1592720	and so she projected all of our collective surveillance fears onto this one app. But the
1592800	1597200	response on liberal Twitter was, wait, oh, they hear about cell phones, which is kind of funny,
1597200	1602240	right? But it's, but the assumption behind that joke is that we all know that our cell phones
1602240	1606880	are listening to us and we're okay with it. But the thing is, people seem not to be okay with it,
1606880	1612320	right? So this is part of the appeal of conspiracy culture is that, you know,
1612320	1616080	they're telling a very simple story. Like if we can just get rid of these apps, then everything
1616080	1620720	will be fine and nobody will be able to track you anymore, right? Or the vaccines or whatever
1620720	1626880	is the kind of boogeyman of surveillance, whereas we actually need policy responses
1626880	1631120	so that we can control these tech companies and they're not able to mine our data endlessly and
1631120	1636240	create more doppelgangers like AI versions of us and so on. Right. The story with a grain of truth,
1636240	1643680	but with a much simpler solution and you can apply it to almost anything. Now, often when someone
1643680	1649040	is a conspiracy influencer like this, there'll be this implication that people will say, oh,
1649040	1654240	they're a grifter and a grifter generally means someone who doesn't believe anything that they say.
1654240	1658160	They're just trying to get the clicks. They're harvesting clicks. They're like following the
1658160	1664160	audience. Did you feel that that was the case in her case? Was she a complete cynic about it? Or
1664160	1668960	do you think she was believing these things and was just not able to sort of connect the dots
1668960	1675360	that they were self contradictory? It's very hard for me to know what she believes, right? And I
1675360	1681360	think that a lot of people who really go all in with conspiracy culture aren't completely cynical.
1681360	1689520	They have to convince themselves of some of it on some level. But that doesn't mean that the primary
1689520	1697200	impulse isn't grifting, isn't ego, isn't getting people to treat you like a savant or whatever.
1698080	1702000	I think she gets a lot out of this, I guess is what I'm saying. I think she lost a lot
1702320	1709840	in the world that she used to travel in. She could no longer get published. After that error on BBC,
1709840	1716240	her publisher dropped her, dumped her book. So she had every reason to move to a new market
1716880	1723920	that is very large. Tucker Carlson, when he had her on Fox, he was getting 3 million viewers a
1723920	1731760	night. There's no show on the left that she had access to that could go near that. So there's
1731760	1740080	every reason. So I don't know what she believes, but I do know that a lot of people who follow this
1740080	1745760	are not just grifting, right? The only reason the grift is successful if it's a grift is because
1745760	1752000	there are lots of customers who sincerely are listening to Steve Bannon and Naomi Wolfe and
1752000	1759920	RFK Jr. and believe it, or else it's not a good grift. You don't have customers. So it's worrying
1759920	1768080	because they're using such apocalyptic language. And if you really are in this battle for humanity
1768080	1774720	against a genocide, that's the kind of language that she uses, good and evil. She's claimed that
1774720	1781040	there is a genocide that has happened because of these vaccines. I think that it, and she also
1781040	1786320	takes pictures of her new gun and says we're at war and post-pictures of her husband doing target
1786320	1793200	practice. So this doesn't end well, I guess is what I'm saying. If you're telling people they are
1793200	1798480	fighting a genocide for good and evil, I think they might take you at your word, whether you're
1798480	1803120	grifting or not, and they might decide to do something about it. And we're seeing lots of
1803120	1808000	examples of that actually. We absolutely are. Well, we have to take a really quick break. When we
1808000	1812160	come back, I want to ask you more about how this has changed your own interaction with your online
1812480	1816320	editing. We'll be right back with more Naomi Klein. You know, the year is never more hectic
1816320	1820240	than during the holiday season with all those travel plans, work projects, wrapping up. And
1820240	1823920	if you run a household, it's sometimes even hard to remember what's for dinner or if anyone's
1823920	1828160	remembered to feed the dog. If this sounds like your home or the home of someone you know,
1828160	1832480	this holiday season is the time for the gift of organization with the skylight calendar.
1832480	1836720	The skylight calendar is a smart touchscreen calendar and organizer for all of your chores,
1836720	1841040	groceries, and to-dos. It automatically syncs all of the different digital calendars and events
1841040	1846160	your family uses and shows them all together on one beautiful touchscreen display. Skylight
1846160	1851200	calendar is the best way to give your family peace of mind to enjoy the things that matter most.
1851200	1855680	It works by syncing events from already existing calendars you have, including Google,
1855680	1859680	Outlook, and Apple calendars. You can also add events directly using the touchscreen
1859680	1865120	or with the free skylight mobile app. And it shows all family events together in one spot
1865120	1869920	so you can see what everyone has going on each week. Families are more likely to actually check
1869920	1875040	it since it's always up to date and so they don't question mom every day about schedules.
1875040	1879840	And additional fun features include dinner planning, grocery list, daily weather display,
1879840	1884320	and weather forecast based on the address of your events. And plus, when it's not in use,
1884320	1890080	you can even turn it into a digital picture frame. And get this, as a special limited time offer for
1890080	1895680	our listeners, you can get $15 off your purchase of a skylight calendar when you go to skylightcal.com

1908080	1911680	Okay, we're back with Naomi Klein talking about online conspiracy theories,
1911680	1916720	the mirror world, doppelgangers. You had this really intriguing idea at the top of the interview
1916720	1922320	about how it made you think about how your own online identity is in some ways a doppelganger.
1922320	1927760	Can you please get into that for us? So, I think when we create an online
1928560	1932640	version of ourselves, when we choose the picture that's going to be our avatar,
1932640	1939920	when we write that sort of like kind of satirical bio, like we are creating a brand.
1941040	1950960	And what is a brand? A brand is a thing version of you, of me. And this is actually
1951680	1957600	the first book I wrote when I was in my 20s was a book called No Logo. And it was about the rise
1957600	1965600	of this idea that companies should first and foremost most be selling an idea, a brand,
1965600	1970160	not that the product was incidental, which was an idea that took root in corporate culture in
1970160	1976240	the 90s, but also that individual celebrities like the first person who called himself,
1976240	1983440	whose agent called him a super brand was Michael Jordan. And he was a mega corporation.
1984400	1992000	And there were others, there was Richard Branson and Oprah, of course. But the idea that regular
1992000	1998880	people could be brands was not possible at that stage, even though there were kind of management
1998880	2002800	consultants saying this is the future and you're not going to get a job, you're just going to have
2002800	2008000	a series of contracts. But if you really want to get ahead, you need to create a brand. And so
2010160	2016800	that didn't become a reality until social media put advertising agencies into all of our back
2016800	2025280	pockets, right? Because suddenly you two can do this for free, like for the price of your phone.
2026240	2032000	And what I'm trying to do in the book is look at it with a little bit of
2033360	2040800	distance, because I think people are often called out for being performative and being
2040800	2048400	inauthentic online and so on. This is like the ultimate smear is like you're just performing,
2048400	2053840	but we're all just performing. And the reason we're doing it is because we have all received
2053840	2061360	this message that the perfected performed self, the brand itself, is really our only hope of
2061360	2072000	survival in these incredibly competitive, shark-fist-laden waters. So yeah, I think we should
2072000	2076720	treat ourselves with a little bit of compassion and thinking about why we build these doppelgangers
2076720	2083200	of ourselves. But a brand is a thing, like humans are not meant to be brands. We've accepted the
2083200	2088320	logic and we're all doing it. And that's why we think we all need to issue press statements
2088320	2094800	whenever anything terrible happens in the world. Right. That is where I went as well, because
2094800	2100480	there's a lot of that happening right now with people saying, you need to post about this. You
2100480	2105040	need to post. You need to speak up. And it's at that moment that the distance between... You don't,
2105040	2110320	by the way. Do you don't. Thank you. I agree. I don't think anyone can force you to post,
2110320	2114720	and I don't think that posting is good by itself. Posting can be something, but it's not...
2114720	2119120	And people will try to shame you into it. Your silence is its own statement and so on.
2119120	2124880	And they're just performing themselves, like that version, whoever those people are who are
2124880	2130080	calling you out for not having issued a press statement about the Middle East.
2132000	2137280	Like unless you are a politician, unless you are a public person with some kind of record,
2137280	2141280	you don't owe that to the world. I think you should read. You should become
2143120	2149200	literate about these issues that are going to impact all of us. But if this is not your area,
2149200	2155360	you do not owe anybody that sort of us versus them performance.
2155360	2160480	Correct. And I felt that really strongly... Well, it made me think about the distance
2160480	2166960	between my brand and my personal self, because I have a large social media presence.
2166960	2171040	There are things that I post about a lot. What I don't post about international affairs,
2171040	2177760	that's not part of my brand. Now, as a person, I have a responsibility to check in on my friends
2177760	2182400	who are affected to learn as much as I can to try to, et cetera, et cetera. But there's a big
2183360	2187600	gap there. And I really was really feeling the gap over those last couple of weeks.
2187600	2191760	Yeah. And I think people feel... You start to feel like somebody's keeping track.
2191840	2196640	Like there's some list somewhere that's keeping track of everybody who has said
2196640	2200400	something, everyone who has said nothing, and we don't want to be on the wrong list.
2200400	2206080	Wait it out is all I can say. Just wait it out. And certainly don't say anything if you don't
2206080	2214400	know what you're talking about. But the point about this idea of that a brand is a thing version
2214400	2221680	of you is a bad way to be human. I have studied what it means to be a good
2221840	2226960	brand. And what it means to be a good brand is to repeat yourself endlessly and have
2226960	2232640	extreme message discipline. So if you are a good brand as a human being, you are incredibly boring.
2233520	2239360	You do not evolve. And you basically are just like a dog chasing its own tail for the rest of your
2239360	2244240	life. You're just Nike. You say, just do it. Just do it. Just do it. Just do it over and over again.
2244240	2247680	Yeah. Yeah. Just change the celebrity, keep the slogan.
2248640	2256560	Yeah. Good branding is all about discipline. And that may work for Nike, but it is
2257360	2263280	really not what one should look for in our attempts to be human, which is to actually evolve and
2263280	2272240	learn from our experiences and reserve the right to change. And it's interesting because it relates
2272240	2280160	to AI because I think the more formulaic we are as people, as artists, as creators of any kind,
2280160	2286960	the easier we are to make a doppelganger of us by AI because AI studies formulas,
2286960	2293680	as you got to keep some machines guessing. Be a bad brand. Break their own formula.
2293680	2299680	But I also think it relates to the cruelty, you know, because a brand is not a human. A brand
2299680	2306640	is a thing. And I think that when we're all out there performing thing versions of ourselves,
2307520	2313600	we start to forget that each other are humans. And then we start to throw very sharp things at one
2313600	2318640	another. And then we're surprised when we hurt each other because things don't bleed, right?
2318640	2322720	You can just, you can hurl anything you want at Nike. That'll be fine.
2322720	2327120	Do you feel that you've created a brand for yourself? Is that, did you say, oh, wait,
2327120	2332640	hold on. I am a brand in a way that I'm no longer comfortable with as you were looking into this?
2332640	2336720	Yeah. I mean, this was a question that came up for me pretty early because my first book,
2336720	2345040	I got really, really fortunate with my first book. And NoLogo became a brand in the world. And it
2345040	2352240	was very awkward because it was this anti-branding book that suddenly, like, there's a NoLogo craft
2352240	2358880	beer in England. There's, there was a whole line of Italian sundries, including some very
2358880	2364880	good olive oil in Italy called NoLogo. And then there was like a restaurant in Geneva called
2364880	2370160	NoLogo, which I went into. I was like, wow, there's a NoLogo restaurant. And I went in and I
2370160	2375040	introduced myself to the owner who ran away. He was so panicked that I was going to stew over
2375040	2381760	something that I had decided not to trademark it because I thought that that compromised my ethics.
2381760	2385280	Anyway, I was like, in my 20s, I could have gotten so rich.
2387920	2391760	Well, yeah, it became a meme, NoLogo. It was everywhere.
2391760	2397920	Yeah. So I, you know, I was confronted with this tension early on of like, okay, so even if I didn't
2397920	2402640	want to be a brand, but I did sort of want to be a brand. And then I just realized it got way
2402640	2407760	beyond my control. So I just decided to try to become a bad brand. And then the next, for me,
2407760	2413920	what that meant was not writing that marketing for another 20 years. So I, you know, my next books,
2413920	2422800	my next books were really not sequels to NoLogo, the shock doctrine, and this changes everything.
2422800	2428240	They were, you know, I just, because I thought to be a good researcher, to be a good investigative
2428240	2433440	journalist, I have to follow my, I have to follow the research and not just chase my tail.
2433440	2437360	And it was very clear to me that some writers just write the same book over and over again
2437360	2441680	and slightly change the title. I mean, they're franchises. It's very popular. But to me,
2442720	2447040	it was never really an option because I don't have the discipline to write about things that
2447040	2452640	are not interesting to me. Like, I'm too lazy for that, you know, it has to interest me.
2453600	2459280	I have to not understand it and have this desire to understand it to keep me working.
2459280	2463200	And the thing about being a good branded author is you've already figured out the formula and then
2463200	2468800	you just have to repeat it. But to me, writing is too hard to do that, you know? Like, if I'm not
2468800	2475520	in a process of discovery, I will just watch television, you know? So it wasn't so much like
2475520	2480000	that I was so pure. It was truly not an option for me. I mean, I guess I could have,
2480000	2482800	now I could have hired an AI to write those books for me.
2482800	2487600	Well, it seems like you also, you had an urge to resist it, which I deal with that in my own work.
2487600	2491920	I have my pet topics I return to again and again, anyone who listens to this show knows
2491920	2497600	what they are. I don't need to list them. But then, you know, I have an urge to get away from
2497600	2501680	that and do something new. But then the problem is, well, how do you sell that? Because people
2501680	2508080	know you for the thing that you just did, right? People know you for that. And so maybe they want
2508080	2511920	more of it. I mean, even this book seems very different that it starts from such a place of
2511920	2514880	personal history of like, hey, this weird thing happened to me compared to...
2514880	2520800	Yeah. Well, I think any kind of success is always going to create its own trap, right? I mean,
2520800	2526480	that's like Dylan, you know, going electric. Like, people didn't want that from him. And
2526480	2535920	then that's why he had to do it, you know? So, but with this book, I, it was similar in the sense
2536000	2543280	that I couldn't bring myself to write a conventional nonfiction book again, because I had lost faith
2543840	2552720	that argument changed minds. I had lost faith in the concept of a linear nonfiction argument
2552720	2559520	based book. Life was just getting too weird. And so I just thought, well, maybe I can write in a
2559520	2563760	complete, in a really different way. And, you know, this book is much straight, it's weirder,
2563760	2568800	but we live in weirder times. And it uses my own double to, to go into a hall of mirrors. And I
2568800	2574800	think that if I had tried to write about this, the weirdness of now, as if I was outside of it,
2574800	2578960	and just be like, I'm now going to make an argument about doppelgangers.
2578960	2584640	No, no, who would want to read that? Like, what's fun is to read about a hurricane from inside its
2584640	2592320	eye, you know? Oh, I love that. I love that. And to explore, yeah, what does this, what does this
2592320	2597520	mean? What does this word mean? And to explore the hall of mirrors from inside the hall of mirrors,
2597520	2601920	like to join you right there and to like try to get out, try to get out, you know,
2602880	2609520	but you got to start inside. Do you have any belief that that project can change minds more
2609520	2616720	than the linear argumentative essay can? You know, I have found that like I've, I've, I have
2617600	2626080	received so many really beautiful responses to this book of people who are grateful to have a kind
2626080	2634000	of a map of, you know, this dynamic with the mirror world where we're defining ourselves against
2634000	2641200	one another and projecting everything we can't stand about ourselves onto them, you know,
2641200	2648960	and then feeling pure because we are not them. And, you know, I think, you know, even something,
2648960	2654960	having a term like the mirror world, I have found like all a writer can do, I always see my role,
2654960	2662560	it's it as helping people read the news better. I know this as a sort of a strange like a job
2662560	2669040	I've assigned, but to myself, but like, I don't, I don't have grand ambitions about what books can
2669040	2676320	do on their own. But I do think that that we can provide a little bit of orientation and some
2676320	2682720	language, right? Like, like with a shock doctrine, I gave people some terms to describe what happens
2682720	2687440	when we're in a state of shock, and people try to take advantage of it. They try to push through a
2687440	2692160	preexisting wish list, right? And so whenever there's a disaster, people, I start hearing people say,
2692160	2696960	well, it's, it's the shock doctrine, it's they're, they're doing disaster capitalism. And I think,
2696960	2703520	okay, I helped people just get oriented a little more quickly. It's not nothing, you know, like,
2703520	2708880	I, yeah, that's, that's all I can do. I think there are more, there's more that we can do
2708880	2714640	that are not books that mostly involve organizing with one another in the real world.
2714640	2720960	Yeah. Well, but to create a piece of language that can help people understand the world more
2720960	2725920	quickly is a powerful thing to do. It's as you say, it's maybe a small contribution in the,
2726000	2732240	in the overall world of language, right, or, or of our concepts, but it, it does give people
2732800	2738960	a new verb almost a new way of, of relating. I want to return to that point of organizing,
2738960	2745920	because I obviously believe that strongly as well. But the online world, I'm curious how you
2746480	2752560	feel about it, because there's a, there's a, just a little aside early in the book,
2752560	2758000	where you say something like, oh, I dismissed that as happening just online and not in the
2758000	2762720	real world. You know, I was so naive back then we were all naive enough to still say things like
2762720	2769760	that. And what's weird to me is I lately have found myself saying, oh, that's just happening online
2769760	2775280	more. You know, I've, I've been on the internet my entire life, literally since I was, you know,
2775280	2781440	very young, I was obsessed with the internet with the computer world and like dwelled there.
2781440	2786480	And now over the last couple of years, I've been like, I want to be on the computer as little as
2786480	2791600	possible. I want to go look at a fucking tree. I want to go like, you know, be, do comedy with
2791600	2795760	people in a room. I want to meet people face to face. I like, I hate zoom meetings. I want to,
2795760	2801040	like, I will go 45 minutes to meet you in person, you know, that's just been my own,
2802720	2808160	my own orientation. And yet we do at the same time live in a world where you can't say, oh,
2808160	2812560	that's just Twitter or you can't. I'm not sure. How do you feel about it?
2813760	2823840	I mean, I think like you, I am drawn to the real to the embodied spaces. You know, I live in an
2823840	2830800	incredibly beautiful part of the world in in coastal British Columbia, where there are many
2830800	2840640	trees to spend time with. And you know, it is really literally grounding. And I don't think
2840640	2846240	that I could do the kind of work that I do if I wasn't able to balance it out with a hike in the
2846240	2855840	forest or some time on the water. And since this book came out, like being in rooms full of other
2855840	2862640	people has felt incredibly nourishing after so much time away. And I think this is how we keep
2862640	2870240	each other sane in these in these very vertiginous times. We are creatures of narrative, like I
2870240	2875520	said, and we we do that work together, you know, we make sense of the world together. And I don't
2875520	2880080	think we can do it just in a zoom meeting. I think there's something irreplaceable about doing it
2880160	2888640	with one another. And so I the way I try to use social media is as a way to get people off social
2888640	2897280	media. So like, come on over, you know, yeah, join the picket line and, you know, and, and, and go to
2897280	2903440	the rally and come to this meeting and come to this event and go to this concert and read this
2903440	2910160	book, you know, and, you know, get wherever the work is deeper than whatever the little box Elon
2910160	2916560	Musk has given us, you know, whatever that little box is or Mark Zuckerberg. So when I see a lot of
2916560	2922560	people using it in that way, right, to bring us to more to to more deeper work that more fully
2922560	2928080	represents us whatever that is. And sometimes it'll be embodied with one another. And sometimes it'll
2928080	2938560	be, you know, just offline. So that's the way I tend to relate to it. I really like that. I, you
2938560	2942720	know, I became well known over the past year for posting from the Writers Guild picket line quite
2942720	2948800	often. And I was that was to me a very beneficial use of social media because people became connected
2948800	2953040	to our struggle and they were able to offer support and and just telling, you know, showing
2953040	2957040	people what was happening was important. But I think it was really important that
2957040	2962000	I was doing it from the picket line. You know, I was like, here I am surrounded by other people
2962000	2967200	and you can see what is happening here in the real world. I'm on the street in front of Netflix.
2967200	2972240	And here's hundreds of people around me or we're at a rally, etc. If I had been doing that from my
2972240	2977520	bedroom, you know, if that if that was where the struggle was taking place, all of us on the internet,
2977520	2982080	it wouldn't, first of all, he wouldn't have won. It wouldn't have been as powerful, but it also
2982080	2987600	wouldn't have, it wouldn't have mattered like the the connecting to, you know, the real life
2987600	2993120	physical organizing mattered so much. And when you're doing that face to face, you see how powerful
2993120	2996960	it is to see someone who you're in, you know, struggle with and you see them face to face and
2996960	3001920	you give them a hug and you say you need some water and you like have a connection. It's just
3001920	3007920	funny though, because so in all this about return to work, so many people make fun of bosses for
3007920	3012400	going, oh, the ineffable synergy of being in the office together and people would make fun of those
3012400	3015680	bosses for requiring people to go back to the office. And part of me would go, I do kind of
3015680	3022640	believe it though a little bit. Like I do agree face to face has something irreplaceable.
3023360	3027120	But talking about nobody wants to go back to their workplaces, it probably means that their
3027120	3031840	workplaces sucked in, you know, they need to change their workplace culture. And that's another
3031840	3037280	argument for organizing, but I love that description because, you know, all of these ways,
3037280	3042880	like ways of building doubles of ourselves, right? Like whether we're optimizing, we're
3042880	3048640	perfecting our brand or we're, you know, I talk about the optimized body as being a kind of
3048640	3054960	doubling, right? Like the idealized form. And this is, you know, part of what pushed a lot of people
3054960	3059520	over the edge during COVID was this idea that they had a strong body, a strong immune system,
3059520	3063680	so they didn't need to worry about other people. And they didn't, you know, they didn't have to
3063680	3069680	think about being in this enmeshed, you know, world of other people. Or they see their kids as
3069680	3075760	their little mini-mes, their little doppelgangers, but all of it is about the self as opposed to
3075760	3085600	building collective power. And, you know, when we are trying to face huge collective problems
3085600	3091520	as individuals, that's when we feel most powerless, right? And we feel ashamed, you know,
3091520	3095200	because we can't seem to make ends meet, despite the fact that we're working so hard,
3095200	3100800	or we're carrying this debt, you know, or we have this terrible boss. And the power of the
3100800	3106720	demonstration, you know, and this is really where the book ends, quoting my friend, Keyanga Yamada
3106720	3112480	Taylor, who teaches history at Princeton, and also quoting the late, great John Berger about
3112480	3120720	the power of the demonstration is not just that you demonstrate to those in power at Netflix
3120720	3126240	or wherever, that there's a lot of you. It's that you demonstrate to one another that you are not
3126240	3134240	alone, that you are, that what felt individual, like an individual crisis for you, because you
3134240	3138560	couldn't pay the bills, is actually a collective crisis. It's actually a crisis for your boss
3139200	3144080	when all, when everybody gets together and withholds their labor or withholds their rent,
3144080	3151200	you know, in a tenants union, or withholds their debt payments in a debtor's union.
3152080	3160080	So that's why we need to get over ourselves, right? That is why I'm grateful to my doppelganger,
3160080	3165920	because I think I care, like all of us, I care too much about my own image. I who the hell cares,
3165920	3171360	you know? So people confuse me with somebody else. And that's that I take that as a message to just
3171360	3174880	get over myself and reach towards other people, build collective power.
3174880	3180240	Oh, I love that. It makes me think of this thought that I've had recurringly over the
3180240	3183840	past couple of years, which is that when you're face to face with other people,
3184560	3189920	they see you in a way that you can't control. I think about this as a stand-up comedian who I
3189920	3193760	perform live in front of other people and I watch other stand-up comedians. And when I think about
3193760	3199520	how the audience regards you on stage, they're looking right at you. You're exposed in front
3199520	3203120	of them. You can try to put up whatever front you want. And a lot of people can put up a front
3203120	3209280	quite well. But the audience is gay is always pierces to something that you don't control,
3209280	3213680	you know? I feel that people are able to, you know, when we're present for each other,
3213680	3219680	we see each other in this sort of like deeper uncontrollable way. And maybe that's why it's a
3219680	3224560	relief to be in person, because we, you know, on the internet, it's all artifice, right? It's all
3224560	3230080	anybody sees as what I control. And it's actually helpful to be in a situation where I'm not totally
3230080	3237360	in control. And then I get, I get seen as a person, which is satisfying and sort of lumpy and weird,
3237360	3242080	even though it's, I don't have control over, it's a little scary, but it is ultimately so much more,
3242080	3246480	there's more fucking going on there. Well, and well, they will also do things you can't control,
3246480	3253440	right? Like, and that's, that's a whole other thing. But it is, it's, I mean, this is the thing
3253440	3258160	about, I think there's certain things about the tools of technology that are habit forming, you
3258160	3264560	know, that when you can mute somebody, you know, and just, or just block, like, like there's something
3264560	3270480	habit forming about the idea that you can just make inconvenient people disappear. Which, look,
3270480	3274800	I'm a muter. I admit it. Like when someone's putting me in a bad mood, I'll mute them. I don't
3274800	3281280	block. It's so much more than the satisfaction. You can't block, but it's so fun to follow someone
3281280	3285920	and then mute them and be like, they don't know that they're muted. They still think I follow them.
3286640	3288880	They're still yelling at me and they think I hear them.
3291520	3298080	But it is, it's a sick thing to take pleasure in. Because when you are in a room with other
3298080	3302720	people, you realize that you can't turn them off. Like they are going to be, they're all fully human
3302720	3306480	selves, right? And this is why we need gun control.
3317760	3323600	I love we're having this very, like, airy philosophical argument about seeing each other
3323600	3328160	and control and identity and persona and you're like, and that's my policy argument for an assault
3328160	3331920	weapons ban. Because I want to have a debate. I just don't want it to end that way. You know what I
3332000	3340960	mean? I love it so much. And this again, it connects to so many things that I've been thinking about
3340960	3345120	who I am and how I move through the world and what I do. It sounds like it's too high and I
3345120	3350640	start wigging out about my online identity and stuff. And this is helping me giving me a framework
3350640	3359040	to think about it, which I think is your goal. So do you have any to bring us in for a landing here?
3359520	3366720	You know, concrete, like, steps that you take away from this journey that you went on with
3366720	3372720	Ms. Wolfe and everything that you learned about the mirror world? Like, how do we, especially
3373360	3376800	if we talk about those people who are really trapped within it and we want to connect back
3376800	3380160	to them? Because I have so many friends who've experienced the pain of that. I have friends
3380160	3386880	who've lost parents to QAnon who they can't speak to anymore. And to that mirror world, what do we
3386880	3397600	do? Well, so all the research shows that if somebody is going to get out of that mirror world,
3397600	3404400	you know, if they're going to get away from Steve Bannon or whoever it is that they have adopted as
3404400	3411280	a guru, it's going to be somebody who they have a preexisting relationship with who will have reached
3411280	3415600	them. And like I said, this world is full of grifters. They're getting fleeced all the time.
3415680	3420000	The stories are changing all the time. They probably have questions. Some people are too
3420000	3425280	far gone, but there may well be people who are looking for an off-ramp. And it's not going to
3425280	3430480	be my book that's going to get them. It's going to be a friend from high school who maybe read my
3430480	3436560	book and had some ideas for how to extend a bridge and find some common ground. Like I said,
3437440	3441680	I don't like Bill Gates. I don't think he's implanting us with chips.
3442240	3449280	I just think he's a fucking asshole who made his billions in a horrible way and then is bad to
3449280	3453600	people and created a propaganda machine about how great he is, where he made his own Netflix
3453600	3458880	documentary about how he's the smartest guy in the world. Exactly. There's so many reasons
3458880	3467280	to hate Bill Gates without making anything up. He's mean to his wife. He's an asshole husband,
3467280	3475120	isn't he? He hangs around with Jeffrey Epstein, if I recall. So I do think that it is worth
3475120	3479200	extending those bridges, but I don't think we're going to solve this one uncle at a time.
3480080	3489360	And I do think if you listen to how these right-wing populists are gaining ground,
3489360	3496080	it's by mixing and matching some true things with some very dangerous and untrue things,
3496480	3503280	great replacement theory. And the immigrants are coming to replace you and teachers are turning
3503280	3511280	your kids' trends. So they'll take something like a fear of surveillance or rightful suspicion of
3511280	3518800	Big Pharma and they'll mix and match it with this much more nefarious agenda. So what we can do is
3518800	3526240	we can take away the true things that they're like, we can take them back and put them to work
3526240	3532240	in a real progressive project. So I don't think we fight conspiracy culture by just like de-platforming
3532240	3538080	and content moderation. And I'm not saying that there's no role for that. But I think that
3538080	3544080	Sean Fain, the head of the UAW, has done more to fight conspiracy culture just being out there in
3544080	3549520	his eat the rich t-shirt and saying, you know, record profits should mean record contracts
3549520	3557040	and like being an actual left populist with a plan, an organizing plan for how to actually
3557040	3561360	meet people's needs. Because what conspiracy culture is, is a distraction machine. It takes
3561360	3569600	people's anger at elites, feeling that they're being screwed over. And it pivots it towards
3569600	3574560	scapegoats, right? So the best way to fight it actually is to give people a real economic project
3574560	3578800	that's going to meet their needs so they are less likely to fall for these counterfeit grifters.
3578800	3585120	Absolutely right. To say, hey, the feeling that you have is real. There needs to be a fight,
3585120	3590160	but to actually wage the right fight and don't just pay it lip service, but organize
3590160	3596720	Marshall the power. I mean, Sean Fain has power in the UAW and he is winning and people can,
3596720	3600960	hey, don't you feel like you're getting screwed? Everybody says, yes, let's fucking do something
3600960	3607040	about it rather than selling you bullshit coins. Fuck Joe Biden coins. He's going after the bosses
3607040	3611760	and that is what they fear most. I mean, there's a reason why some of the richest people on this
3611760	3618400	planet love a good conspiracy theory. Like, why is Elon Musk the single, you know, greatest vector
3618400	3623440	of misinformation right now? Like, if you were the richest man on the planet on a good day,
3623440	3629360	you would want people distracted too. You know, you would want people not looking at systems of
3629360	3635680	economic consolidation that allowed you to get as rich as you are. You would want them talking
3635680	3641840	about the Jews and the CCP and, you know, Anthony Fauci and the rest of it. It's a distraction machine
3641840	3646960	and it serves elites even though they claim to be fighting elites like Rupert Murdoch, right?
3647840	3652160	So we just need to understand this. We need to do a little mapping. That's all. Get order.
3652160	3656960	We need to understand it. And then we need to organize to show the alternative path.
3656960	3660560	And then we need to win, which we are starting to do, I think.
3660560	3664640	I think so too. I think so too. And I want to thank you for all of your organizing in
3664640	3669040	real world action, right? Because this is, that's how, that's how, that's,
3669600	3676000	that's the best way we fight this sort of fake world is by doing real work, real work.
3676000	3680640	That is such a beautiful conclusion to this conversation. Naomi, I'm so thrilled that you
3680640	3685040	came on the show. I can't wait. I'm going to get this book, an audio book, I think,

3696240	3699280	is there anywhere else that people can follow you or your work?
3700880	3704080	Okay, I guess I'm on. I mean, I can't answer the question now.
3704080	3708880	You're right. You're right. After an hour of talking about Twitter and stuff like that,
3708880	3713040	you know what? How about this? I have a website, NaomiCline.org, and you can, you know,
