00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
Hello, and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me once again as

00:05.360 --> 00:10.160
I talk to an incredible expert about all the amazing things that they know that I don't know

00:10.160 --> 00:14.400
and that you might not know. Both of our minds are going to get blown together. We're going to have

00:14.400 --> 00:19.360
so much fun. This week, we're talking about language. You know, people are constantly

00:19.360 --> 00:24.480
arguing about what the right and wrong ways to use language are as though the rules of language

00:24.480 --> 00:30.960
were encoded by some grammar god from on high. But they're not. Language isn't a set of objective

00:30.960 --> 00:37.600
rules like math. No, language is created, changed, and used by people. And that means it will always

00:37.600 --> 00:41.760
resist our attempts to control it. There was actually a funny example of this the other year in the

00:41.760 --> 00:49.040
UK. A London primary school made a bold attempt to ban slang. And by bold, I mean pointless and

00:49.040 --> 00:54.800
stupid. I mean, how are you going to stop teens from beginning sentences with because, like, or

00:54.800 --> 01:00.720
basically this school even tried to ban phrases like he cut his eyes at me, which I mean, come on,

01:00.720 --> 01:06.160
that's not just slang. That's poetry. That sounds like Shakespeare, man. And it's a phrase, along

01:06.160 --> 01:11.440
with many others that were banned that originated among marginalized people. Controlling language

01:11.440 --> 01:16.000
like this seems to be more about limiting the influence of certain people rather than the words

01:16.000 --> 01:22.880
themselves. And at the end of the day, it won't work. Because again, language is created by people

01:22.880 --> 01:27.920
and people are irrepressible. If you set up a linguistic rule, you would better believe some

01:27.920 --> 01:32.560
enterprise and kid is going to come along and break it. And when they do, they are going to use that

01:32.560 --> 01:38.000
new word phrase or sentence structure to mean something new, because that is what language

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
fucking does, bro. Now, none of that stops language from being a constant culture war target from the

01:44.000 --> 01:50.400
battles over ebonics in the 1990s to conflicts today over the use of supposed woke language.

01:50.400 --> 01:55.920
But those battles ignore something fundamental. The way people use language reveals something

01:55.920 --> 02:01.120
about them, about who they are and where they come from and what is happening in their world.

02:01.120 --> 02:06.000
So instead of telling people not to use language a certain way, what if we took the opportunity

02:06.000 --> 02:11.520
to learn from how they actually do use it? Well, fortunately for us, there is an entire field of

02:11.520 --> 02:16.000
study that looks at the relationship between culture and language called sociolinguistics.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.680
And on the show today, we, in fact, have a sociolinguist who has written a fascinating new book

02:21.680 --> 02:26.080
on this very topic. Her name is Valerie Friedland, and she's a professor at the University of Nevada,

02:26.080 --> 02:30.640
Reno, and the author of a new book called Like Literally Dude, arguing for the good

02:30.640 --> 02:34.800
in bad English. And you are going to love this interview with her. But before we get to it,

02:34.800 --> 02:39.040

03:08.000 --> 03:12.720
let's get to my interview with Valerie Friedland. Valerie, thank you so much for being on the show.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.120
Absolutely. I'm excited to be here to talk with you.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.800
So you're a sociolinguist. Tell me very briefly, what does that mean?

03:18.800 --> 03:22.720
Well, first of all, I am impressed with how well you pronounce that. That trips a lot of people

03:22.720 --> 03:27.840
up, which is part of the reason I went for that is my title. I love language. That's how I knew,

03:27.840 --> 03:29.680
that's how I know how to pronounce everything. I love it.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.440
Because I know the English language front to back.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.480
I love it. All right. Well, we're going to test that as we go today.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.080
Okay. I would love to.

03:36.080 --> 03:40.480
I'm a linguist, a theoretical linguist, which means that I study the underlying structure of

03:40.480 --> 03:46.160
language, how languages form in the brain, how your articulatory structure helps get language out.

03:46.160 --> 03:51.200
But my particular interest is how social triggers and these underlying linguistic

03:51.200 --> 03:57.840
tendencies interact and become language changes and evolve over time. So that's why I'm a sociolinguist.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.880
And so give me an example of that. Like I'm sure your book is full of them, but give me an example

04:02.880 --> 04:06.320
of how that social world will affect how language evolves.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.560
Oh, absolutely. So I think a really seminal example is just looking at how

04:11.200 --> 04:15.120
English has come to be the modern English we speak today versus being German

04:16.320 --> 04:21.440
or something more like Icelandic, which hasn't changed much since its proto-Germanic days,

04:21.440 --> 04:27.120
because we all started as a different language. But its social forces that came into the history

04:27.120 --> 04:33.520
of English's development that changed it from a Germanic language, almost 100% Germanic word

04:33.520 --> 04:39.280
stock to a language that has only about 30% Germanic word stock, because we had wars, we had

04:39.280 --> 04:45.200
invasions, we had Vikings, we had all sorts of fun stuff. But we also had class and class plays

04:45.200 --> 04:50.880
a huge role in shaping language. And during the middle English period, class was seminal

04:50.880 --> 04:55.120
in forming the English that we speak today. So the lower class spoke English and the upper

04:55.120 --> 05:00.480
class spoke French. And whenever you have unregulated language change going on without a lot

05:00.480 --> 05:06.640
of upward pressure on keeping it standard or codifying it, natural evolutionary processes

05:06.640 --> 05:11.120
in language, natural cognitive processes in language take place. And they meet with that

05:11.120 --> 05:16.480
social trigger of social class and social standing. And that's really what formed the modern English

05:16.480 --> 05:21.040
of today. So that's a really good example of how language triggers that are always there and social

05:21.040 --> 05:25.760
triggers that come into play at certain times and places, interact and create something new and

05:25.760 --> 05:30.560
novel. You know, an example of this interaction with a class that I heard, and I hesitate to

05:30.560 --> 05:34.080
repeat it because I worry it's like a just so story that I heard, but maybe you can correct me

05:34.080 --> 05:39.120
and tell me if it's real or not, is that the reason we have different words in English for or in

05:39.120 --> 05:44.640
modern American English, at least, for the animal versus the meat that comes from the animal is

05:44.640 --> 05:48.800
because of that class distinction that other languages, they use the same word or many others

05:48.800 --> 05:56.960
they do. But in English cow versus beef, beef is French because it was the cow is the English

05:56.960 --> 06:01.840
because it was the peasants who were dealing with the animal and the lords and ladies who

06:01.840 --> 06:06.640
actually ate the meat. And so we ended up with this French descended word. That's a story I

06:06.640 --> 06:10.720
heard many decades ago. Is that true? It seems to match the front line that you're talking about.

06:10.720 --> 06:15.840
It is true. That's a great story. Actually, you can even read about it in Ivanhoe when they talk

06:15.840 --> 06:21.840
about the peasants and what they called the food and the nobility and what they called the food.

06:21.840 --> 06:28.880
It was very different because English had the words for the animal. So cow and swine, for example,

06:28.880 --> 06:33.920
are the English words. But French was the language of nobility and it was the language of the upper

06:33.920 --> 06:39.520
class at the time. And so the words that were used when you actually served as a servant, when you

06:39.520 --> 06:46.160
served that animal, you used the French word. So cow became labouf. And that is exactly why we have

06:46.160 --> 06:53.280
that two faced way to call animals and meat in English today. Well, now you mentioned the idea

06:53.280 --> 07:01.120
that in the absence of a pressure to standardize the language, these evolutionary things will happen.

07:01.120 --> 07:07.440
But that's also a big feature of languages, especially English. I grew up being told there's

07:07.440 --> 07:12.400
a right way to speak and a wrong way to speak. I used to say, I'm doing good. And my friends would

07:12.400 --> 07:17.840
say, Adam, Superman does good. You're doing well. And I was like, fuck off. You're being an asshole.

07:20.320 --> 07:27.200
We're used to these sort of battles in English. And so in your view, very broadly, what role does

07:27.200 --> 07:33.360
that those standardization forces play? I mean, is that a beneficial effect on languages? Is it

07:33.360 --> 07:36.960
something that we should leave behind? It seems like a battle that never ends.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.920
Well, I think it's actually a fairly new battle, which most people don't realize. What you're talking

07:41.920 --> 07:47.520
about is prescriptivism. And we seem to think prescriptivism has been around forever because

07:47.520 --> 07:52.080
we learned it. And we remember our parents saying, no, it's not him and you that went to the party.

07:52.080 --> 08:00.720
It's he and you that went to the party or he and I went to the party. But reality is that language

08:00.720 --> 08:05.680
has evolved so much since the old English period precisely because there weren't a lot of

08:05.680 --> 08:10.880
codification and standardizations that existed in the Middle English period to tell us how to speak.

08:10.880 --> 08:16.800
And so it was natural evolutionary processes, natural trickulatory forces that led language to

08:16.800 --> 08:22.080
where it is today. And it really wasn't until about the 18th century that we had people that were

08:22.080 --> 08:26.240
like, wow, you know, I like the way I say this better than the way you say it. So let me write it

08:26.240 --> 08:30.640
down. And now everybody's going to say it this way. So these prescriptivist tendencies, these

08:30.640 --> 08:36.400
grammar books, these dictionaries really didn't start being written until about 1700. And that's

08:36.400 --> 08:42.640
where we get this really strong complaint tradition. It's starting about that era where you don't do

08:42.640 --> 08:47.280
it right, but I do it right. And you should do it like me. I think the big question is not whether

08:47.280 --> 08:53.520
one opinion is right and one is wrong, but can they coexist? And we understand where these two

08:53.520 --> 08:58.800
different beliefs about language stem from and what their purpose might be. So a prescriptivist

08:58.800 --> 09:04.800
might say, you should say it this way, because first of all, that's how people in power say it.

09:04.800 --> 09:09.600
And if you want to achieve that kind of economic or political power, you should say it this way

09:09.600 --> 09:16.640
because that will get you in the door. They might also say that this is tradition and tradition

09:16.640 --> 09:22.880
is valuable. So there is some benefit to that kind of speech. A descriptivist or someone who just

09:23.440 --> 09:28.560
language naturally evolved might say, well, almost everything you say that you think is correct today

09:28.560 --> 09:34.560
was wrong at some point in time and is an evolution from some previous point. And if we didn't allow

09:34.560 --> 09:39.280
language to proceed naturally, then we would still have case markers in English. We would still have

09:39.280 --> 09:43.680
grammatical gender in English. We would still have plural marking on every word in English.

09:43.680 --> 09:48.240
We would have strong and weak verb classes, none of which do we have today. And our language is no

09:48.320 --> 09:54.320
less for for for it. In fact, we are as expressive and creative and inventive as ever,

09:54.320 --> 09:58.160
so that there's nothing wrong with natural evolutionary processes. And they're more

09:58.160 --> 10:04.400
authentic to speakers personalities. My answer would be, I think both are right. There are times

10:04.400 --> 10:08.960
in places where prescriptivism might fit. So for example, in writing, it's probably important to

10:08.960 --> 10:14.480
have codification standardization. And even in more formal speaking contexts where I'm giving a

10:14.480 --> 10:19.440
talk or I'm a CEO of a company and I am in a leadership position and I want to make sure

10:19.440 --> 10:25.520
everybody understands me and that I'm a model in some way, that might be an appropriate place

10:25.520 --> 10:32.320
for for prescriptivist notions. But if it's a teenager or somebody talking on the street or

10:32.320 --> 10:36.720
my friend or my neighbor, then if they start using that kind of language, I actually think they're

10:36.720 --> 10:43.600
an asshole. So it doesn't really serve. Yeah, if you're lecturing someone in person,

10:43.680 --> 10:47.120
you're lecturing someone in person on the proper use of the semicolon and they're like,

10:47.120 --> 10:51.360
dude, I was just fucking talking to you. Like I don't, I wasn't using semicolons. Like, well,

10:51.360 --> 10:55.760
you actually raised a really good point that I didn't even think of because I often think of

10:55.760 --> 11:00.640
prescriptivism as being simply wrong, that, you know, people claim that there's a right way to use

11:00.640 --> 11:05.440
language and a wrong way to use language. And I think that's incorrect. I think that languages,

11:05.440 --> 11:10.240
as you say, it's socially determined. And when someone says there's a right and way wrong way,

11:10.240 --> 11:16.320
they're really making a statement about the about society, about, you know, people about the

11:16.320 --> 11:20.480
I'm the right kind of person, and you are the wrong kind of person, and you should be more

11:20.480 --> 11:26.880
like me, I'm standard, I'm normative, I'm dominant, I'm the I'm the rule, and you're the exception.

11:27.760 --> 11:34.880
However, you do make a point that writing is very different from speech, that there are rules that

11:34.880 --> 11:40.960
I do sort of believe are rules in, in writing about, I don't know, I think you need to close

11:40.960 --> 11:46.080
the parentheses, you know, very basic stuff, punctuation marks and things like that. And,

11:46.080 --> 11:50.880
and that made me just you saying that made me realize, oh, wow, yeah, writing just English

11:50.880 --> 11:57.840
writing for someone else to read is far more rule bound than speeches and is actually a completely

11:57.840 --> 12:01.760
different way of using language. They don't, they barely, if you were to write down what I'm

12:01.760 --> 12:07.360
saying to you right now, it would be incoherent because I'm interrupting myself, I'm like inserting

12:07.360 --> 12:11.440
clauses in the middle of sentences and then trailing off, they're completely different ways of using

12:11.440 --> 12:17.040
language. And yet I understand every word that you said because in real speak context where we're

12:17.040 --> 12:23.120
face to face or, you know, television screen to television screen, we, we have context and we

12:23.120 --> 12:28.800
have background knowledge, we also can read other signs from our bodies, eye gaze, various things

12:28.800 --> 12:32.960
like that that allow us to fill in those holes, but in writing, you're absolutely right, we don't

12:32.960 --> 12:39.360
have that contextual information, and it wouldn't make sense. So we need more conventions in writing

12:39.360 --> 12:44.480
than we need in speech. But I want to clarify that speech has a lot of rules. So I think a lot of

12:44.480 --> 12:49.440
times people misconstrued what I'm saying to mean, okay, we don't have to have rules when we talk,

12:49.440 --> 12:54.160
it's not important, because I absolutely agree with you that when we are judging someone on their

12:54.160 --> 12:59.040
speech, because it's different from a prescriptive norm, we're just being prescriptive as assholes

12:59.040 --> 13:04.720
who think we're right and they're not. And that's not an appropriate way to frame someone else's

13:04.720 --> 13:10.880
speech. You can say, I don't like your speech, it's not my preference. But saying something is

13:10.880 --> 13:15.520
disliked is very different than saying something is bad, which makes a moral judgment. And when

13:15.520 --> 13:20.000
I'm telling you that you're not good enough, because of the way your speech, your speeches,

13:20.000 --> 13:24.560
I'm telling you that I'm morally judging you on the basis of something that's just different than

13:24.560 --> 13:30.640
my own views and beliefs. But that doesn't mean that speech is not governed by rules. If we didn't

13:30.640 --> 13:35.520
have rules governing speech, we wouldn't be able to understand each other. We have lots of rules

13:35.520 --> 13:40.320
that govern speech. They're just not the type that appear in a grammar book or a dictionary.

13:40.320 --> 13:45.440
They're the type that we know in here that we learn as babies, that we understand whenever we

13:45.440 --> 13:50.160
have a conversation, no matter who we are and whether we're literate or not. So for example,

13:50.160 --> 13:57.920
if I tell you, Ted thinks that John knows himself well. Well, who does the himself there refer to?

13:58.560 --> 14:04.560
You know, it has to be John. It can't be Ted. Because of the rules that I understand as a

14:04.560 --> 14:09.360
speaker of human language and a two year old, if you give them like two different puppets to

14:10.080 --> 14:16.480
play with and to pick out, you say, Ted knows that John knows himself, and you name one puppet Ted

14:16.480 --> 14:21.280
and the other puppet John, they will always pick the right puppet to refer to himself, because

14:21.280 --> 14:25.920
that's an underlying rule of language that allows them to find the right antecedent. But these are

14:25.920 --> 14:30.400
unspoken rules that we don't need someone to put in a dictionary. And if we did, we'd have to wait

14:30.400 --> 14:35.280
till a kid could read, which would be way too late for language. So language is fundamentally a

14:35.280 --> 14:38.880
different skill than writing, and we shouldn't expect the same rules to apply.

14:38.880 --> 14:44.880
Wow, that is so cool. And my mind is blown whenever I encounter a rule like that one that I learned

14:44.880 --> 14:49.280
a couple of years ago, and you'll tell me the proper version of it. This will be my dumb dumb

14:49.280 --> 14:54.640
recitation of it. But it's that there's a particular order of modifiers or adjectives in

14:54.640 --> 15:03.280
English that if I were to say, you know, the big red scaly British dragon, right, those words all

15:03.280 --> 15:08.960
come in a particular order. If I were to say the scaly red British big dragon, that immediately

15:08.960 --> 15:14.400
sounds wrong to me, and it sounds wrong to you too. And there's like an order of, there's like

15:14.400 --> 15:20.080
quantity, size, where it comes from, what its demeanor is, and those all come in a particular

15:20.080 --> 15:25.440
order that I intuitively know, despite the fact I was never taught this in school. No one ever

15:25.440 --> 15:29.280
sat me down and said, Hey, if you're going to apply eight modifiers in a row to a particular

15:29.280 --> 15:34.320
noun, here's the order they have to come in. And yet I know it. So where do rules like that,

15:34.320 --> 15:40.880
or the himself one that you described, where do they come from? Are they socially determined?

15:40.880 --> 15:45.920
Are they specific to languages or what? Well, you just walked into a big controversy in

15:45.920 --> 15:51.520
logistics. Oh, no. Oh, actually, not, not, oh, no, that's exactly what I love to wander into.

15:51.520 --> 15:55.520
It's an academic controversy. Break it down for us. What is the controversy? Well, if you're a

15:55.520 --> 16:00.800
Chomsky, and meaning someone that follows the syntactic theories of Noam Chomsky, which is,

16:00.800 --> 16:05.600
has been a very influential field of thought in modern American linguistics, you would say,

16:05.600 --> 16:09.600
well, the baby is born with that. It's part of our innate grammar that we're born with. We are

16:09.600 --> 16:14.720
born talking so that we're not not physically talking, but we're born talking in our brain that

16:14.720 --> 16:19.280
we have a specific area of the brain that's devoted to linguistic processing and syntactic

16:19.280 --> 16:24.960
structures. And all it needs is sort of activation or triggering by input from the environment. And

16:24.960 --> 16:30.240
once it hits those triggers, certain, you know, little boxes are checked and it develops language,

16:30.240 --> 16:36.480
this it being the baby. Others are functionalists. And this has become a little more prevalent in

16:36.480 --> 16:42.720
American thinking, I think, in modern eras versus maybe 20 years ago when Chomsky and philosophy

16:42.720 --> 16:47.280
was really the, the only way you would think. And this says that, okay, we are, you know,

16:47.280 --> 16:52.320
born with some capacity for language, there do seem to be some fundamental structures that help

16:52.320 --> 16:57.680
guide the way that baby's brains process for language. But it's not language exclusive,

16:57.680 --> 17:03.920
it's learning exclusive that brains are made to learn in certain ways. And those ways that it

17:03.920 --> 17:10.880
learns interacting with the way the world is certain facts about the world, create a knowledge

17:10.880 --> 17:18.160
form that that is universal. And so I think a good example of this would be when we,

17:18.240 --> 17:26.240
when we have case in the language. So for example, I in English is object K is sorry, subject case,

17:26.240 --> 17:32.640
and him is an object case pronoun, right? So you see that there's changes in the same or I and me

17:32.640 --> 17:39.280
or he and him. What we find is in languages that are subject verb object, like English,

17:39.280 --> 17:43.920
where the subject goes first, and then you have a verb, and then you have an object like I saw him.

17:43.920 --> 17:51.520
Yeah, those languages often don't have case or can lose case without too much difficulty because

17:51.520 --> 17:56.480
the subject and the object are widely separated. And there's a marker in the middle saying, okay,

17:56.480 --> 18:02.160
I'm the verb that acts back on the subject and forward on the the object. So it has a clear

18:02.160 --> 18:07.200
separation between that subject and the object. So it's easy for your brain to process who did

18:07.200 --> 18:11.680
what to whom without case marking, right? That's just a functional fact of the way that that

18:11.680 --> 18:15.680
sentence is structured. But what we find in languages that have the subject and the object

18:15.680 --> 18:20.800
close together like a subject object verb language, I think Japanese is a good example of this.

18:20.800 --> 18:28.000
German is like this, I learned it in college. German is like, you're like, I, him, blah, blah,

18:28.000 --> 18:32.320
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, on Tuesday met. And then you have to wait all the

18:32.320 --> 18:35.520
way into the end of the sentence a lot of the time to find out what the verb is. And to see who

18:35.520 --> 18:40.320
is doing what to whom. Right, exactly. So exactly like German, what you find is if you have the two

18:40.320 --> 18:46.160
subjects and the objects right beside each other, it would be very hard if you didn't mark with case

18:46.160 --> 18:50.400
to understand which was the subject and which was the object because they both precede the verb.

18:50.400 --> 18:55.040
And so we just find as a natural functional tendency languages that have that kind of structure

18:55.600 --> 19:01.760
have case languages that don't have that kind of structure don't have to have case. So these are

19:01.760 --> 19:08.960
functional developments that arise for our brain's ability to process information. So again,

19:09.040 --> 19:12.800
there are two very different arguments about how language occurs in the brain and how we learn

19:12.800 --> 19:18.160
these rules. But fundamentally, it's from the way the brain is structured and how we're

19:18.160 --> 19:24.000
structured as humans to process the world. That's really fascinating because whether you're a

19:24.000 --> 19:29.520
Chomskyite or a functionalist about it, and we could, I don't think we need to dive deeper into

19:29.520 --> 19:35.600
the difference, regardless of which one you are, this is part of the structure of how humans work

19:35.600 --> 19:41.840
rather than something you need to learn in a style manual or that you need to be taught in school.

19:42.960 --> 19:48.400
It's actually absent from the rules that you would learn in a setting like that because it's

19:48.400 --> 19:54.880
sort of built into us, which is really, it's really fascinating that the language pedants

19:54.880 --> 19:59.520
don't even bother to tell you about it. But there's all these other rules that they feel that they

19:59.520 --> 20:03.280
often need to enforce. Never split an infinitive, you know, that kind of thing

20:04.480 --> 20:11.840
is very fascinating to me that we end up, that some folks feel a need to have that kind of rule.

20:12.640 --> 20:16.880
Let's move on from the talk about prescriptivism though. One thing I'd love to ask you about,

20:16.880 --> 20:24.240
I know you write about, you write about interject, I literally put it into that sentence,

20:24.560 --> 20:30.080
interjections like uh or you know, and I would love to talk to you about this because as someone

20:30.080 --> 20:36.480
who talks for a living, I actually happen to use a lot of them because I think a little bit faster

20:36.480 --> 20:42.880
than I talk sometimes. I have a lot of ideas. I tend to use those words. There have been times

20:42.880 --> 20:46.720
that people in the industry have told me, you should really watch yourself for that and make

20:46.720 --> 20:51.040
sure you don't use those that often because they make you sound stupid or whatever. And then I go

20:51.040 --> 20:56.160
through a little period where I try to stop myself from saying you know so much. But it's so much a

20:56.160 --> 21:01.200
feature of my speech that I don't know, I don't know if I'll ever be able to completely eradicate

21:01.200 --> 21:05.200
it. So what is your view as a linguist of where those interjections come from and what purpose

21:05.200 --> 21:09.600
they have? Well, first I want to apologize because after we talk about them, you're going to hear

21:09.600 --> 21:14.560
them every time you say them for the rest of our conversation. So we should have saved this for the

21:14.560 --> 21:19.440
end because people are going to hear me do it for the entire rest of the podcast and it's going to

21:19.520 --> 21:26.400
drive them fucking insane. Exactly, once you hear it once and people talk about it. So I apologize

21:26.400 --> 21:31.200
in advance to everybody listening. But the nice thing is we shouldn't be so upset about it because

21:31.200 --> 21:35.760
those things are doing great work for us. And as you said, you talk for a living. It's different

21:35.760 --> 21:41.280
than writing. If I stuck a lot of you know, and all those things in my writing, then it might be

21:41.280 --> 21:47.040
distracting and it might detract from the purpose. But when we're in conversation, our job is not

21:47.040 --> 21:53.680
only the strict literal semantic information that I'm trying to transmit. It's also the relationship

21:53.680 --> 21:59.200
we have, the ideas we have about it, and also my personal beliefs about what I'm saying,

21:59.840 --> 22:04.720
how I came to that knowledge, whether I'm sure about that knowledge or less sure than that

22:04.720 --> 22:09.600
knowledge, something called epistemics in linguistics. So all these different things are

22:09.600 --> 22:17.760
competing for our ability to phrase them somehow. And so things like, you know, actually well. So

22:17.760 --> 22:23.440
all of those help direct the listener to have certain expectations about what the speaker's

22:23.440 --> 22:29.120
intending. And this is actually very helpful as a listener to have someone point out to you how

22:29.120 --> 22:34.320
you're supposed to take something because we all have been in those situations where we say something

22:34.320 --> 22:41.360
and it's not quite taken like we intended it. A lot of times if you don't sign post or provide these

22:41.360 --> 22:48.400
conversational cohesion markers, then you increase the tendency of other people to misunderstand

22:48.400 --> 22:53.680
where you're headed, your own relationship to what you're saying, or how certain you were about

22:53.680 --> 22:58.960
what you're saying. So when I say something such as like, when I use like as a discourse marker,

22:58.960 --> 23:05.040
what like communicates in many cases is a subjective sensibility. This idea that what I'm

23:05.040 --> 23:11.040
telling you is not precise, but it's sort of the sense that I want you to get from what I'm saying,

23:11.040 --> 23:16.400
or I want to use it for emphasis. So for example, if I said I was waiting like 20 hours for you,

23:16.400 --> 23:22.400
dude, what I probably wasn't doing is waiting 20 hours and I don't intend for you to take it that

23:22.400 --> 23:27.600
way. What I'm emphasizing by putting that like in there is that, hey, asshole, you made me wait

23:27.600 --> 23:32.640
for a really long time and I pissed off about it. So it's communicating that versus saying,

23:32.640 --> 23:37.840
I was waiting for 20 hours, which certainly doesn't complicate the same force, the same

23:37.840 --> 23:43.440
emphatic force. So all of those little markers are extremely meaningful in our everyday speech.

23:43.440 --> 23:47.760
And in fact, if we look at studies that remove those, those discourse markers like you know,

23:47.760 --> 23:53.920
and like, and well, and so from the speech of subjects, and we have other listeners listen

23:53.920 --> 23:59.120
to them and rate them on how sociable they were, how well likable, how likable they were,

23:59.120 --> 24:03.360
those kinds of things, we find that when we remove those discourse markers, people hear

24:03.360 --> 24:09.520
that speech as less friendly and more robotic. So we want them in there. So you're just friendlier

24:09.520 --> 24:17.040
and not a robot. So isn't that good? That is good, except that I often find that other people in

24:17.040 --> 24:22.400
my position, broadcasters, if you watch someone on CNN, you watch a CNN guest, they've likely

24:23.040 --> 24:29.600
trained themselves to remove all the us from their speech. And it's sort of seen as a mark of

24:29.600 --> 24:35.600
professionalism. And but do you think that that maybe that's counterproductive because it's making

24:35.600 --> 24:40.880
those folks less friendly, it makes them seem stiffer or more broadcasty? Or I suppose it depends

24:40.880 --> 24:44.960
on the on the medium, but well, that's actually a really good question, because I think what you're

24:44.960 --> 24:49.040
drawing attention to is two different things than what we were talking about previously. So I was

24:49.120 --> 24:54.320
mentioning discourse markers, like like, you know, some and well, but what you're talking about is

24:54.320 --> 25:00.720
I'm and which are actually filled pauses. So those are fundamentally and functionally different than

25:01.440 --> 25:06.480
filler words, which is what you were talking about previously. And they do very different work. So

25:06.480 --> 25:11.840
we're things like, you know, well, so they, they actually are for conversational cohesion, and they

25:11.840 --> 25:18.560
signpost and provide some epistemic value often. So how someone is to take something. I'm and are

25:18.640 --> 25:24.400
actually markers of speech planning. And they don't don't themselves have any kind of literal

25:24.400 --> 25:29.760
meaning that they contribute to what I'm saying, whereas so does and well does they actually

25:29.760 --> 25:37.040
contribute some sort of meaning. I'm and I in fact, are usually more likely to occur when someone

25:37.040 --> 25:41.040
has not rehearsed what they're going to say when we're in spontaneous discourse, when we're saying

25:41.040 --> 25:47.760
them something that's more abstract, more difficult, less familiar, those kinds of situations will

25:47.760 --> 25:53.760
increase the numbers of us and arms that we use. So when we're in a context like a CNN expert,

25:53.760 --> 25:58.640
and we expect someone to know what they're talking about, I'm and I would signal to us that they

25:58.640 --> 26:03.440
are not practiced, and they are not familiar with what they're saying, and therefore would be taken

26:03.440 --> 26:10.240
as a disfavorable sign of their ability to communicate. In conversation, though, I want to

26:10.240 --> 26:14.720
know people are working hard to come up with interesting things to say. So if we're in a

26:14.720 --> 26:20.560
regular back and forth conversation at a party or at a bar, and you say a couple times what that

26:20.560 --> 26:25.280
tells me is that you're actually spending some cognitive effort on coming up with what to say.

26:25.280 --> 26:29.440
So in those cases, I don't think there's anything wrong with using them. In a case where I'm giving

26:29.440 --> 26:36.000
a public talk, for example, or I'm on television as a host, I would expect it to be more practice,

26:36.000 --> 26:39.920
and therefore it would probably be less valuable to use those in those contexts.

26:39.920 --> 26:45.920
Oh my god, this is that's such an incredible breakdown of when it's useful and when it's not

26:45.920 --> 26:49.600
and when we actually might want to remove those words and when we might not want to.

26:50.800 --> 26:55.120
And I think a lot of my conversation here, part of what I'm doing in conversations like

26:55.120 --> 26:58.880
this with you, I am thinking on my feet because I'm sort of the I'm the interlock you to hear,

26:58.880 --> 27:02.880
I'm not the expert, I'm asking you questions, I'm trying to be surprised by what you're saying,

27:02.880 --> 27:08.080
you know, and so it makes sense for me to be puzzling through my thoughts as I'm talking to

27:08.080 --> 27:11.360
you because that's the sort of conversation I'm trying to have. So in this context, this is a

27:11.360 --> 27:18.480
good context for me to go, oh, that's really interesting, Valerie. But if I'm in the opposite

27:18.480 --> 27:23.920
context, maybe I'm being interviewed about something I know a lot about, then perhaps it

27:23.920 --> 27:27.920
might be better for me to be a little bit more locked and loaded if I'm trying to communicate

27:27.920 --> 27:33.760
more expertise. Also, when you're talking about conversational markers like like,

27:33.760 --> 27:39.200
one that I've heard come up more recently is putting right at the end of a sentence. I find

27:39.200 --> 27:43.840
myself doing that in interviews. Actually, sometimes when I am the expert in a context right

27:43.840 --> 27:49.760
now, I'm being interviewed a lot about union matters because I'm in the leadership of my union

27:49.760 --> 27:53.440
and we're in the news a lot lately because we're on strike. And so something I'll do a lot is I'll

27:53.440 --> 28:00.800
explain, right? And I'll just sort of toss that little right at the end. And it feels like a

28:00.800 --> 28:07.040
similar sort of social lubrication where I'm trying to draw the audience along and

28:07.040 --> 28:12.240
communicate that I'm making an argument that I hope is going down easily. It seems like a cousin

28:12.240 --> 28:17.440
to like rather than a cousin to perhaps. You know, it's funny because I actually have an

28:17.440 --> 28:21.920
anecdote in the book where I was talking to a podcaster and they were so relieved to hear me

28:21.920 --> 28:26.080
talk about all these different features of having a purpose and being useful because they said that

28:26.080 --> 28:31.200
they're often called out for their over frequent use of right in just the same context you talk

28:31.200 --> 28:37.440
about it. So it must be a podcaster right. Another person who is regularly taken to task for their

28:37.440 --> 28:43.120
use of right in that same way is actually Mark Zuckerberg. He uses right a lot in that context.

28:43.120 --> 28:48.640
So see, you're in very good company. That right is. Well, I don't want to be in company with Mark

28:48.640 --> 28:53.360
Zuckerberg personally. That's what we can get. That's a different episode, but you know, I have

28:53.360 --> 28:57.920
my beefs with Mark, but okay, I understand that we might be using it in the same way. Please go on.

28:57.920 --> 29:02.480
Well, so what you're doing there is actually inviting the audience to make inferences. So

29:02.480 --> 29:06.960
when you use right in that context, you're pausing to let them catch up and say, okay,

29:06.960 --> 29:11.120
I'm checking that you're making the right inference and you're keeping up with me. So it's a

29:11.120 --> 29:17.840
licensure device where you're using it to help give them a moment to get up to speed and then

29:18.400 --> 29:24.000
making sure that they're getting the inference you're intending. So a lot of times people have

29:24.000 --> 29:28.960
dislike that because it causes work on the side of the listener. If you're inviting someone to

29:28.960 --> 29:34.400
make inferences, you're asking them to do work and some listeners may feel like that's asking a lot

29:34.400 --> 29:39.680
of them to do actual work. So, you know, I think it's funny that that bothers us, but I've heard

29:39.680 --> 29:44.720
that one in particular, that inferring right to be something that people remark on quite often as

29:44.800 --> 29:49.360
they've noticed more and more in people's speech. But I think what it really is is just the sign

29:49.360 --> 29:54.880
that we're in conversation and we recognize we have a listener in conversation. It's not just us

29:54.880 --> 30:00.000
talking, right? You're actually, and I just used it, we're actually making sure that someone is there

30:00.000 --> 30:05.360
with us and moving along with us. Now, I think where people sometimes get upset is when they're

30:05.360 --> 30:11.520
listening to people on the radio or on a podcast and they're using that right. And maybe the people

30:11.520 --> 30:16.080
are not agreeing or not making that same inference. And that's where they're getting a little tweaked

30:16.080 --> 30:20.560
about it. Yeah, they're like, Oh, no, not right. I disagree with you. Like, I think taxes should be

30:20.560 --> 30:26.480
higher or whatever it is. Yeah, exactly. But no, you're completely correct that I do it because

30:27.600 --> 30:33.200
I am trying to lay out an argument for the person listening and I want them to come along. I was

30:33.200 --> 30:37.440
like, Hey, are you still on the, are you still on the wagon? Like, are we still traveling together

30:37.440 --> 30:44.720
here? We're in this together. I'm not just like blah, blah, blah. I'm trying to lay out a trail

30:44.720 --> 30:48.560
of breadcrumbs for you and hope that you follow it and we're in it together. And I'm trying to

30:48.560 --> 30:53.440
remind them of that. At least that's what I think I'm doing. It is wonderful to talk to you. You are

30:53.440 --> 30:59.840
like a therapist for podcasters. And I honestly think this is a fee that you should offer where

30:59.840 --> 31:04.400
you just talk to people about the linguistic ticks that everyone in the YouTube comments is getting

31:04.400 --> 31:09.920
on their ass about. Cause it does, it is something that happens to us as public speakers is that as

31:09.920 --> 31:14.480
soon as someone comments on something like, Oh, do I need to, do I need to change it? And oh,

31:14.480 --> 31:21.200
God, everything I'm doing is wrong. You know, it's, it's very, uh, you can really get in your own

31:21.200 --> 31:29.520
head. And I guess I wonder what is the value of trying to restrict your own speech in that way,

31:29.520 --> 31:35.440
trying to control your own speech and be rigid with it versus doing what comes naturally. Like a

31:35.440 --> 31:39.680
lot of times on a podcast, I just want to be my natural self a little bit more up and talkative

31:39.680 --> 31:45.040
than my natural self, but I'm not trying to, I worry that if I were to police myself for the

31:45.040 --> 31:49.680
rights and the ums and the us too much that I would become stiff and it wouldn't be as good of a

31:49.680 --> 31:54.160
conversation. What do you think? Well, I think then you'd get angry emails saying that you were too

31:54.160 --> 31:58.480
stiff and, and you know, sounded like a uptight stick in the mud. So you're never going to make

31:58.800 --> 32:03.200
people happy. It doesn't matter what it is. There's always going to be something in your speech

32:03.200 --> 32:09.520
that people will respond to and dislike. And the more that you are not white and male, the more

32:09.520 --> 32:16.240
often that will happen. So women in particular in broadcast settings get a ton of voice hate mail,

32:16.240 --> 32:21.760
much more than men in similar positions and African Americans likewise. So it really,

32:21.760 --> 32:26.000
which really interesting is we have this set belief about here's how someone should talk,

32:26.080 --> 32:31.200
but that belief is actually fairly fluid in the sense that even if someone talked the way we think

32:31.200 --> 32:36.000
we want them to talk, then something else in their speech is going to irritate us. So, you know,

32:36.000 --> 32:42.320
for every like that annoys somebody and someone's speech, then they'll say, I hate how you use like

32:42.320 --> 32:47.600
while they use so a lot, right? And then for every so at the beginning of a sentence that they use

32:47.600 --> 32:54.640
that someone else hates, that person uses well too much or uses okay all the time or uses right

32:54.640 --> 32:58.800
in the middle of their sentences. So there's always going to be something that someone doesn't

32:58.800 --> 33:03.120
like. And if we try to spend most of our time worrying about what people like and dislike in

33:03.120 --> 33:07.840
our speech, then we're not going to be authentic and real and have connections. And that's the

33:07.840 --> 33:13.280
point of speech in the end. And if we can move away from the idea that there is a right way to

33:13.280 --> 33:18.400
talk and a good way to talk, and then there's a bad way to talk, instead, we look at it as

33:18.400 --> 33:25.920
there are ways that we have in common that help bond us as speakers and other ways that help

33:25.920 --> 33:31.120
point to the fact that we are not the same person and that's okay. Then I think we can be a more

33:31.760 --> 33:37.600
connecting empathetic audience and speaker at the same time. It's just getting our head wrapped

33:37.600 --> 33:42.560
around that I can dislike the way that someone talks, but that doesn't mean that the way they

33:42.560 --> 33:47.280
talk is bad. And that's a crucial distinction. That is a wonderful message to take us to break with.

33:47.280 --> 33:51.920
But when we get back, I want to talk to you about teenagers and slang and all these crazy

33:51.920 --> 33:55.200
words that kids are always coming up with. But we have to take a really quick break. We'll be

33:55.200 --> 34:00.080

34:33.600 --> 34:37.760
See you there. And now back to the interview. Okay, we're back with Valerie Friedland before

34:37.760 --> 34:44.080
the break. We were just talking about how women are often criticized excessively for the way that

34:44.080 --> 34:49.280
they speak their use of language when they're speaking publicly. That's certainly true. I want

34:49.280 --> 34:52.640
to talk about another group of people who are often criticized for their language, which is young

34:52.640 --> 34:58.880
people, teenagers or even kids are constantly being told that they're speaking wrong. In my intro,

34:58.880 --> 35:04.400
I talked about this case where a UK school is trying to ban ban the use of slang entirely,

35:05.360 --> 35:12.960
which obviously seems completely excessive. Why is slang such a sore spot for adults?

35:12.960 --> 35:17.760
And what purpose does it serve for young people? Well, first of all, anybody trying to ban slang,

35:17.760 --> 35:23.920
good luck with that one. There's just no way. You know, young people are the innovators in language.

35:23.920 --> 35:29.440
And pretty much we have them to thank for all the features of language we use today without

35:29.440 --> 35:35.040
young people. We would have no linguistic revelations, we would have no innovations,

35:35.040 --> 35:39.920
we would have no new words to describe the experiences that we have in our world. So

35:39.920 --> 35:45.520
it's funny that we want to eradicate what they add to our language instead of embrace it. But

35:45.520 --> 35:50.800
I think a lot of it is because what we notice that young people do is invent novel slang that's

35:50.800 --> 35:58.080
maybe a little counterculture or rebellious or even taboo in some ways. And a lot of what they say

35:58.160 --> 36:03.920
is never going to hit mainstream and become the language of our future. But the more underlying

36:04.480 --> 36:10.320
things that they introduce, the new ways of using language innovatively like saying,

36:10.320 --> 36:17.520
adulting sucks from adult, they follow the pattern that many of us have trod before. So for example,

36:17.520 --> 36:25.040
parent was a noun long before it was a verb. So if I say parenting sucks, nobody blinks an eye and

36:25.040 --> 36:30.320
most of us that are parents would approve of that message. But when I say adulting sucks,

36:30.320 --> 36:35.120
I roll my eyes because teenagers are using language in a bad way. But we didn't really see

36:35.120 --> 36:40.880
the word parenting come into widespread use until the 20th century. It was always a noun before that.

36:41.600 --> 36:47.600
Shakespeare was renowned for using nouns as verbs and verbs as noun. So this is just part of the

36:47.600 --> 36:52.480
natural evolution of language. But it's all in the mouths of the young, the young who are more

36:52.480 --> 36:57.520
creative and innovative and more free to do creative things with language that these types

36:57.520 --> 37:03.360
of forms come forth. And because they're different than what we say, and because we think we say

37:03.360 --> 37:08.080
everything correctly, we judge young people for doing it a lot of times because they are doing

37:08.080 --> 37:12.240
it a little bit to piss us off. I mean, admit it when you were a teenager, you wanted to you

37:12.240 --> 37:15.760
wanted to piss your parents off. And the first thing you want to do is speak differently than

37:15.760 --> 37:20.240
your parents. And that drives a lot of this creativity and innovation. But the thing we

37:20.240 --> 37:26.400
forget is that young people also have more neural plasticity than us old folks, which is really

37:26.400 --> 37:31.440
unfortunate for us. But they can make much quicker neurofiber connections, they have more

37:31.440 --> 37:38.720
more neural connectivity. And they also are able to analyze really underlying distributions,

37:38.720 --> 37:44.400
really subtle variations in things better than adults can. So that primes them for linguistic

37:44.400 --> 37:49.040
innovation, because they notice these low lying tendencies at a rate much higher than old people

37:49.040 --> 37:55.200
do. So then the problem is they start to use it. And it's different than what we say. And then we

37:55.200 --> 38:01.760
hate it. So that's really the cycle of language change. This is just there. They have a special

38:01.760 --> 38:06.000
ability as young people that we have lost and we're angry about it. It's like when you see,

38:07.120 --> 38:14.080
you know, when you're, look, I cannot ski, I'm so bad at it. And now I'm, I also would never do it

38:14.080 --> 38:18.560
because I am too worried about my joints at this point in my life. I'm not going to take that risk

38:18.560 --> 38:24.320
with my body. And when I see a five year old on skis or a four year old on skis and you see them

38:24.320 --> 38:28.400
and you're like, man, when they fall down, they don't even feel it. They bounce, you know,

38:28.400 --> 38:34.480
and I resent them for that because they have this ability of youth that I have lost. Maybe that is

38:34.480 --> 38:38.000
why we get mad at them. We're like, you're coming up with new words. I can't do that anymore.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.080
Exactly. Well, also remember that when you're five, you're only two feet from the ground.

38:42.640 --> 38:47.440
That helps when you fall. But yes, it's, it's partially that. It's partially that we are a

38:47.440 --> 38:53.120
little resentful of their creativity. But I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we see

38:53.120 --> 38:59.280
young people as not quite fully formed. And a lot of times they use language in ways that are

38:59.280 --> 39:04.880
slightly rebellious. I mean, the attraction to new forms of young people is usually because

39:04.880 --> 39:09.920
it's different than what parents do. And it's a little bit rebellious and nonconformist. And

39:09.920 --> 39:15.440
then as adults, we are constantly telling our kids to slow down when they're screaming down the

39:15.440 --> 39:19.760
mountain, right? And we're doing the same thing with language. So even though we might teach them

39:19.760 --> 39:25.040
to ski, we don't teach them to go 100 miles per hour skiing. Same thing with language. We, we give

39:25.040 --> 39:29.200
them the fundamental structure of language. That's our role as parents. And when they're born

39:29.200 --> 39:33.040
and we're, we're giving them input, they're getting our system as the fundamental system.

39:33.040 --> 39:38.400
But then they go to school and they do something called vernacular reorganization, which is just

39:38.400 --> 39:42.640
the fancy linguistic term for they look at their peer group and go, wow, there's so much cooler

39:42.640 --> 39:48.400
than mom. I'm going to be like that. And then they adopt that because that's really who they want

39:48.400 --> 39:54.880
to model themselves after. But I think parents can rest assured that all of that finds its place.

39:54.880 --> 39:59.920
And we, we go through these periods in adolescence where we're really attracted to these rebellious,

39:59.920 --> 40:07.440
nonconformist, maybe even nonstandard, maybe even offensive things at times. But what we find is

40:07.440 --> 40:12.320
something called age grading. As kids get into the professional work world, as they become adults

40:12.320 --> 40:18.080
and become parents, they naturally start to adjust their speech towards those old boring

40:18.080 --> 40:23.840
traditional norms that older speakers adopt. So whatever was coming up as a new feature in their

40:23.840 --> 40:30.400
speech that's not stigmatized will become the new norm. But stigma stigmatized or rebellious

40:30.400 --> 40:35.120
features tend to get dampened in their rate and they don't get used as much. So like use is a

40:35.120 --> 40:39.680
good example. A lot of people hate like they think their kids use it too much. They want to kill,

40:39.680 --> 40:45.680
you know, kill it in their kids speech. But as kids move from being a 17 year old, you know,

40:45.680 --> 40:52.080
like user in every Senate to a 25 year old professional, they will naturally start to use

40:52.080 --> 40:56.000
like less often, even though they want to eradicate it completely from their speech,

40:56.000 --> 41:01.200
but they'll use it at a level that's not highly stigmatized anymore. It's just a natural transition

41:01.280 --> 41:06.560
that happens. That's so cool. Well, one of the things I think is coolest about the way

41:06.560 --> 41:12.720
teenagers or young people use languages, there's like a natural creativity that is so exuberant

41:12.720 --> 41:17.200
that like every school in America has its own slang that no one else has ever heard.

41:17.200 --> 41:23.520
I had a friend who was teaching school at a, you know, at a high school in Brooklyn for just a

41:23.520 --> 41:27.120
couple of years. He's a substitute teacher and he was telling me the kids slang, this is about 10

41:27.120 --> 41:32.560
years ago. He said that kids were using the phrase, it's quiet for that now to mean that

41:32.560 --> 41:38.080
something is boring or that it's like old hat, you know, it's, it's, it's passe or that you

41:38.080 --> 41:42.560
shouldn't do something cause it's the wrong time, you know, like you shouldn't, you know, if you're,

41:42.560 --> 41:46.000
if you're like singing a song during study hall or it's quiet for that now, we're not doing that

41:46.000 --> 41:50.400
right now, you know, and I love that phrase. I just love saying it. I still say it to my

41:50.400 --> 41:54.080
girlfriend around the house as quiet for that now. You know, she's like, you want to watch that

41:54.080 --> 41:58.320
show and ask quiet for that now. I don't like it anymore, you know, but it's like this particular

41:58.320 --> 42:02.480
piece of slang. I mean, maybe people, maybe other people in the comments have heard it. Maybe it was

42:02.480 --> 42:10.800
all over New York city in 2012 or whatever. But, but I never heard it except from my friend

42:10.800 --> 42:15.840
who reported it hearing it, you know, in the wild. And I'm sure that kids in that school are no

42:15.840 --> 42:19.920
longer saying that they're, that they're onto something else new. And that is, I think the

42:20.000 --> 42:25.360
coolest thing. It's, I mean, that's the true folk process. That's people coming up with their own

42:25.360 --> 42:30.080
exuberant uses of language that means something to them. And then it sort of dissipates over time.

42:30.080 --> 42:34.880
I think that's an amazing thing about language. It is. It's remarkable when you watch young people

42:34.880 --> 42:39.680
in language and how they engage with it, create it, innovate it, and then leave it behind or

42:39.680 --> 42:45.520
embrace it for the future. So a lot of the things you're talking about are slang terms or words

42:45.520 --> 42:50.480
themselves. So my daughter's always using the ones like, they're such a pick me. And I'm like,

42:50.480 --> 42:55.360
what a pick me? What do you mean a pick me? But what she meant was they're a remember in school

42:55.360 --> 43:00.000
when you would be the one wanting to be on the volleyball team, he'd like, pick me, pick me.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
Well, now they use that word to mean there's, they're always trying to get out in front and

43:04.000 --> 43:07.680
be the person chosen. So they're always somebody who needs to kind of attention to my daughter's

43:07.680 --> 43:12.560
like, Oh my God, what a pick me. So they've used this creative knowledge of, you know,

43:12.560 --> 43:18.080
this idea of what you do for sports or in gym class to become a descriptor of a person's specific

43:18.080 --> 43:23.360
style of interacting or engaging. Or she'll say, Yeah, I'm so aggressed, which is, you know, I'm

43:23.360 --> 43:27.840
angry. It's just they're really creative and wonderful with language. But those are vocabulary

43:27.840 --> 43:31.920
words, which are actually pretty ephemeral in language, so they can pick them up and use them.

43:31.920 --> 43:35.920
And then when they're not cool anymore, or too many people do it, or especially if adults start to

43:35.920 --> 43:40.800
pick it up, then it's bye bye, right? I'm not interested. But what we don't understand is that

43:40.800 --> 43:47.040
young people are actually the heart of language evolution more generally, so that what they're

43:47.040 --> 43:51.680
doing with language at a much more subtle structural level, the changes that they're making

43:51.680 --> 43:57.440
in very small tweaks and refinements are actually going to be the future of our language in bigger

43:57.440 --> 44:03.200
ways. So let me give you an example that maybe you hadn't noticed. When you're using words like

44:03.280 --> 44:11.200
everybody, somebody, nobody, do you even say buddy anymore? Or do you say everyone, someone, no one?

44:11.760 --> 44:17.360
Everyone. I actually couldn't tell you. I would think I would think I use, let's say everyone was

44:17.360 --> 44:22.560
there, everybody was there. I'm not sure which I'd use more often. To be honest, I'm sorry to not

44:22.560 --> 44:26.000
have a good answer. Well, you probably know it's actually not surprising because people are not

44:26.000 --> 44:30.240
very reflective on that, right? You don't think about everybody or no one. And that's how language

44:30.240 --> 44:36.000
change happens, where one form starts to be used more often by people that are somehow cooler or

44:36.000 --> 44:42.160
hipper or better than you in some way socially, often in adolescence. And what seems to be happening

44:42.160 --> 44:47.440
is buddy is being replaced by one, especially among younger speakers. You see very few younger

44:47.440 --> 44:53.920
speakers say everybody, somebody, nobody. In fact, almost all of them say everyone, someone, no one.

44:53.920 --> 44:58.160
Now that's a much more, that's a much more underlying structural change. It's not a slang

44:58.160 --> 45:03.040
word. It's not a vocabulary word. But when we look now at older speakers, we find that starting

45:03.040 --> 45:07.520
to creep into older speakers speech. So when we do a study and we look at different age groups,

45:07.520 --> 45:13.520
what we find is that everybody, the buddy in those words is losing ground to one,

45:13.520 --> 45:19.680
which will be in 10 years, 15 years, probably the only form that we use anymore and everybody

45:19.680 --> 45:25.760
and nobody will seem very archaic and old. So these are actually the more substantive types

45:25.760 --> 45:30.400
of change that young people bring into our language. Another good example is using weight

45:30.400 --> 45:35.120
as a discourse marker. So I might, if you're, you know, somewhere and I need to go get something,

45:35.120 --> 45:42.560
I might say, could you wait five minutes, meaning physically stand for some time to wait for me.

45:42.560 --> 45:47.120
But what we find now is people are saying, wait, I don't think so, where they're actually using

45:47.120 --> 45:53.200
weight as a discourse marker, which doesn't really mean weight any particular amount of time. When I

45:53.200 --> 45:57.360
say weight, I don't think so. I'm not telling you to physically stop and wait for me. What I'm

45:57.360 --> 46:03.680
saying is a metaphorical pausing. I'm taking a metaphorical pause here. What we find is that's

46:03.680 --> 46:09.520
also a new change coming in young people say, wait a lot more than older speakers who don't

46:09.520 --> 46:15.840
say, wait, they say, wait a minute. And so it went from no discourse marker where weight was only

46:15.840 --> 46:22.000
used as a main verb that actually meant pausing to wait a minute used by older speakers to mean

46:22.000 --> 46:28.800
metaphorical pausing to now younger speakers that only say, wait, not wait a minute. And what we

46:28.800 --> 46:32.640
find is when we look 50 years ago, when we start to study that change, not only was it young

46:32.640 --> 46:38.640
speakers, it was lower class young speakers and lower class and young are the magic sauce to

46:38.640 --> 46:44.240
language change. And that seems to then suggest that that will be what we say going forward that

46:44.240 --> 46:48.640
wait a minute is gone the way of the dodo and weight will be the new discourse marker. So

46:48.640 --> 46:52.640
these are really cool things that we don't even realize we're doing. And then they work their

46:52.640 --> 46:57.600
way into our language because young people started them. Yeah, that is so fascinating. Now I was

46:57.600 --> 47:02.320
about to ask you about race and language because that's, you know, there's a lot of interactions

47:02.320 --> 47:07.120
there in American life. You just brought up class though, class and race often intersect in American

47:07.120 --> 47:14.960
life. So how do those elements come into it? I mean, obviously there's a history of race in

47:14.960 --> 47:19.840
America is very fraught. A lot of our, I think, greatest language innovations come from marginalized

47:19.840 --> 47:24.880
groups throughout American history. How do those things work together? Well, absolutely. Just like

47:24.880 --> 47:31.280
lower class speech features being something that is often a triggering impetus for change.

47:31.280 --> 47:38.320
So is ethnicity. And not only that, but it could also be things like not necessarily ethnicity,

47:38.320 --> 47:42.640
but other subcultures that are marginalized like drag culture. Drag culture is actually

47:42.640 --> 47:47.920
brought a lot of words into our language. So for example, vogue is a word that came from drag

47:47.920 --> 47:53.280
culture. And I think the word of the year this year was a suffix called ussy, which was the

47:53.280 --> 47:59.200
ossification. Who's word of the year? Was that Mariam Webster? That was the American Dialect

47:59.200 --> 48:04.000
Society's word of the year because that was also from drag culture where it was the ossification

48:04.000 --> 48:12.560
of all things could be ossified. The American Dialect Society is cool, man. You're with

48:12.640 --> 48:20.720
it. I assume you're a member. I am a voting member. Yes, I am. You voted for ussy. I did not actually,

48:20.720 --> 48:25.440
there was another word I really wanted. I have to say ussy was a runner up, but I can't remember

48:25.440 --> 48:29.440
what my, see it's gone. I don't even remember it anymore because it didn't win. Oh, wow, because

48:29.440 --> 48:33.440
it's not the word of the year. Well, no, ussy is like, look, all you got to do is look at the

48:33.440 --> 48:37.600
TikTok comments and you'll see that ussy is indeed the word or the suffix of the year.

48:38.560 --> 48:41.840
So yeah, I mean, tell me more about that phenomenon.

48:41.840 --> 48:47.920
Well, you know, what happens is things happen in adolescents that are cool and interesting that

48:47.920 --> 48:52.400
have nothing to do with the types of things that we value as adults, especially standard speaking

48:52.400 --> 48:58.240
adults who disdain anything associated with marginalized groups or groups that we disfavor in

48:58.240 --> 49:02.320
society. But when you're a young person and you're in school or you're in a community,

49:02.880 --> 49:08.480
what you really want to do is stand out in some way. We also want to sort of project these

49:08.480 --> 49:13.040
different kinds of identities. And a lot of times that's tied into these groups that are

49:13.040 --> 49:19.600
marginalized in society, such as African-American culture or drag culture or whatever culture

49:19.600 --> 49:25.200
that you're identifying with, but particularly in inner city schools, if you want to, you know,

49:25.200 --> 49:29.120
not get beaten up for your lunch money every day, one of the ways to do that is project

49:29.120 --> 49:36.400
speech features that signal toughness, nonconformity, physical strength. And one way that particularly

49:36.400 --> 49:43.600
young white men do this is to be adopting the features from groups in school that they identify

49:43.600 --> 49:50.320
as physically tough, as rebellious, as nonconformist, as dangerous in some way. And even though these

49:50.320 --> 49:55.600
are stereotypes about those cultures that are not true to the cultures themselves, they have much

49:55.600 --> 50:00.320
more depth than that. The features that those groups use, so African-American features in

50:00.320 --> 50:07.120
particular, are often then appropriated by these young men to personify those identities, like

50:07.120 --> 50:13.280
being tough, being cool and being macho, to help them fit in in the world. And then these features

50:13.280 --> 50:18.560
then grow up with them. So they become part of the language of the larger mainstream culture,

50:18.560 --> 50:23.840
which is how we get a lot of features, like even the word jazz, which was actually an African-American

50:23.840 --> 50:29.200
word, get into mainstream culture. And I think one way we see it now is woke. The word woke was

50:29.200 --> 50:33.760
actually an African-American English word that now has made it into mainstream culture for better

50:33.760 --> 50:38.800
or worse, depending on how you look at it. Well, then depending on how it's used, I mean, the problem

50:38.800 --> 50:45.920
is that even though these are the folks who are being incredibly innovative with language, right?

50:45.920 --> 50:51.120
As you say, the intersection of youth and class and marginalization that sort of caused the

50:51.120 --> 50:56.960
innovation and also caused it to be adopted by the more, you know, by the dominant, you know,

50:56.960 --> 51:03.040
normative folks, it's the marginalized groups who get criticized for their use of language or

51:03.040 --> 51:08.000
attacked for the use of language. I mean, just, you know, having gone through, you know, in the

51:08.000 --> 51:13.600
90s, growing up in, you know, the war over ebonics as a phrase where that became a punchline, right?

51:13.600 --> 51:22.000
As, you know, a pretty well-meaning linguistic project was turned into a joke that was, you

51:22.000 --> 51:26.960
know, on the everybody in white culture made fun of for a couple of years at the same time

51:26.960 --> 51:31.680
that they were then appropriating those same words and those same speech patterns is like a

51:31.680 --> 51:37.040
really pernicious cycle, is it not? Absolutely. I mean, the funny thing is that we really hate

51:37.040 --> 51:43.040
language change. We think it's somehow bad that it points to some sort of decay in society, but

51:43.040 --> 51:49.360
it's really because language change typically begins in the groups that we have stereotypes

51:49.360 --> 51:55.920
or prejudice against. And because of that association, we dislike it and we try to push it

51:55.920 --> 52:02.960
away. But it is, it's very much the fact that we don't police our language when we are members of

52:02.960 --> 52:08.240
marginalized communities, according to the norms of the dominant society, that we allow in-group

52:08.240 --> 52:12.640
markers to develop, that we allow different linguistic tendencies that are underlying all

52:12.640 --> 52:18.320
language to just affect change in our varieties, that those things come out of those groups rather

52:18.320 --> 52:23.920
than the groups that maintain these standards and forcibly don't let their language adapt.

52:23.920 --> 52:29.360
And then it becomes staid and boring and it doesn't have much life. I mean, look at Latin,

52:29.360 --> 52:33.760
right? We didn't, we don't allow Latin to change and no one's using that to hang out and go to the

52:33.760 --> 52:39.200
bars and form solidarity and connection. But when we allow language to emerge and become

52:39.760 --> 52:45.840
naturally communicative, naturally connection making, naturally part of our identity process,

52:45.840 --> 52:52.880
then it becomes something that other people look at and basically want to take over because

52:52.880 --> 52:58.720
we want what that represents. We want the social connectedness that we feel those features

52:58.720 --> 53:06.400
amplify. So when I hear someone using really low sort of informal, low class speech, it might

53:06.400 --> 53:11.200
seem bad to me as a speaker of standard English, but it also means like they're informal, they're

53:11.200 --> 53:15.760
intimate, they're relaxed, they're familiar, they're friendly, right? It has these other

53:15.760 --> 53:21.440
associations. And when I'm an adolescent, that's really attractive to me. I want that. I want to

53:21.440 --> 53:25.920
have that. And also, even when I'm a standard speaker, when I go home and talk to my kids or

53:25.920 --> 53:30.000
I go home and I talk to my spouse, I don't want to come home talking like the office. I want to

53:30.000 --> 53:35.280
use the speech that's connection, the speech that's familiarity, the speech that's intimacy.

53:35.280 --> 53:42.240
And you can't get that without some emphatic senses, some subjective senses, some natural

53:42.960 --> 53:48.880
laid back kinds of features. And those are what we draw from in marginalized group speech,

53:48.880 --> 53:54.640
because that is what that has come to represent, the connection, the community, the social identity

53:54.880 --> 54:00.720
of friendliness, of companionship, of solidarity. That's something that even the most

54:00.720 --> 54:06.240
priggish people who want to criticize marginalized group... And by the way, when you say we don't

54:06.240 --> 54:11.360
like that speech, I like to think that I do like it. I'm more broad-minded about it.

54:12.240 --> 54:16.480
But even if somebody is that priggish about it and they're like, oh, how dare they talk that way,

54:16.480 --> 54:19.840
they're still hearing that language going, oh, I wish I had that level of community.

54:19.840 --> 54:24.400
I wish I could partake in that a little bit. And they end up adopting those words because

54:24.880 --> 54:32.320
communicates a certain level of informality and ease with other people that we all crave in our

54:32.320 --> 54:38.480
lives to have... Oh, you hear another community talking with that kind of ease. I want to use

54:38.480 --> 54:44.720
those words too, because they communicate comfort and community in a way that I crave. And that I

54:44.720 --> 54:51.600
don't get from my formal, rigid, office, white, affluent talk. And I think there's also, especially

54:51.600 --> 54:56.800
with African American speech, there's an edginess and a counterculture-ness that we tend to

54:57.840 --> 55:02.080
find associated with those kinds of speech forms. And a lot of that has to do with the very fact

55:02.080 --> 55:08.640
that we marginalize those communities. When we push a community to the extremes, to the edges,

55:09.440 --> 55:16.720
then we also create a situation where we almost envy their status as outsiders and as rule breakers

55:16.720 --> 55:23.600
and as sort of being non-traditionalists. And even though they didn't ask for that role, and often

55:23.600 --> 55:30.080
they have traditions of their own, from the perspective of the dominant group, that's the

55:30.080 --> 55:36.320
kinds of qualities that get put on their features of speech, put on their styles of dress, put on

55:36.320 --> 55:42.160
cultural things that they have associated with them. Music. Right. And so then that becomes enviable

55:42.160 --> 55:48.960
because it seems cool and edgy and chill and laid back and whatever qualities, edgy and even

55:48.960 --> 55:53.600
gangster, right? I think a lot of young speakers, young male speakers are attracted to that kind

55:53.600 --> 55:58.240
of dangerous, rebellious sort of sense that it has. And that's really something we put on it

55:58.240 --> 56:02.880
because we pushed it to the outside. But then by doing that, we want to bring it back in and make

56:02.880 --> 56:08.240
it part of our speech so that we can get those qualities that now those features have when they're

56:08.320 --> 56:13.440
used by members of that community. So it's this really interesting cycle of pushing out, pulling

56:13.440 --> 56:19.360
in, pushing out, pulling in. But then, of course, what happens is young speakers adopt it and then

56:19.360 --> 56:26.000
older speakers who don't see the value in it, disdain their speech as well, until those become

56:26.000 --> 56:32.320
more dominant and are used in wider culture. So when words like jazz or woke start to get picked

56:32.320 --> 56:37.520
up and move more mainstream, we almost forget where they came from, which then is a disservice,

56:37.520 --> 56:41.040
of course, to the people that started them. So it's a weird vicious cycle.

56:41.040 --> 56:48.800
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're describing really the structure of how racism and marginalization

56:48.800 --> 56:55.440
eventually leads to appropriation. And in some cases, theft, in some cases, productive borrowing.

56:56.560 --> 57:05.520
But you're just describing the entire problem of American culture and race and it just through

57:05.520 --> 57:11.920
linguistics. I mean, and it really goes to prove the point that you learn so much about

57:11.920 --> 57:17.440
people and the structure of a society through language, which sort of, it gets to my point

57:17.440 --> 57:25.360
that I made in the intro to this episode that we waste so much time criticizing the speech of others,

57:25.360 --> 57:30.800
whether that's marginalized groups or each other or ourselves, when we could be learning from

57:30.800 --> 57:36.320
that speech. We could be understanding, oh, wait, this says something about the speaker,

57:36.320 --> 57:41.600
about the structure of our society that we use language in this way. Does it not?

57:41.600 --> 57:47.040
Absolutely. And I think if we think back to the history of English, one great example of us doing

57:47.040 --> 57:52.000
this and now it's so assimilated into our language that we don't even remember that we did it, is

57:52.000 --> 57:57.520
how many, many of the words that we use in modern English and even our pronouns, for example, come

57:57.520 --> 58:04.000
from the Vikings who were definitely not looked upon favorably when they were pillaging in the

58:04.000 --> 58:09.440
eighth and ninth centuries. But a lot of the words that we have, so for example, the pronoun they

58:09.440 --> 58:15.680
and them, those are Norse, those are Norse words, words like window and sister and skirt,

58:15.680 --> 58:20.720
those are Norse words. And the interesting things about the words that we borrowed from Norse,

58:20.720 --> 58:27.760
from the Vikings, are their everyday words, the words about life. Because when we interacted

58:27.760 --> 58:32.960
with the Vikings, when it wasn't vicious, obviously, when it was, you know, in everyday

58:32.960 --> 58:38.400
interactions, it was about the day to day work of life. It was about seeing each other in the farms

58:38.400 --> 58:43.040
and learning from each other in those casual interactions. But when we interacted with the

58:43.040 --> 58:48.320
French, it was up, right? It was because they were the rulers, it was us as the servants,

58:48.400 --> 58:53.280
them as the rulers. So the types of words that we have from French tend to be the highfalutin

58:53.280 --> 58:59.200
words, words from medicine, words for law, like the word judge, the word prison, the word government,

58:59.200 --> 59:03.520
those are all from French, because that's the kind of interaction we have with them. So when we

59:03.520 --> 59:09.200
look at even the types of words that come in from these different subcultures, we learn a lot about

59:09.200 --> 59:14.720
our relationship with those speakers. Yeah. And man, it's just, as soon as you start looking for

59:14.720 --> 59:20.240
this stuff, you see it everywhere. I mean, even what I do is stand up comedy, right? It has its own

59:20.240 --> 59:24.000
language. It has its own way of speaking. One of my favorite things to do is talk to other stand

59:24.000 --> 59:30.080
up comics in a green room. And we have our own, it's not quite a dialect or even a, you know,

59:30.080 --> 59:34.560
sort of a, you know, Carney language or anything like that. It's just like there's a few,

59:34.560 --> 59:40.800
there's a few unusual words. There's a few unusual ways of speaking. There's extreme casualness that

59:40.800 --> 59:47.840
like connotes a, you know, that we're participants in a certain, in a certain world. And some of those

59:47.840 --> 59:52.800
words, if, but not all have made their way into the, into the broader language. George

59:52.800 --> 59:57.440
Carlin famously did a bit about how you kill, you crush, right? If you did well and you die,

59:57.440 --> 01:00:04.160
if you, if you bomb, you bomb, right? There's all these words about violence. But, you know,

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:10.400
it's like, this is happening in a million subcultures around the world at every single moment. And

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:15.840
it's such a beautiful thing about language. And all we can really do is, is hope to describe it and,

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:20.400
and use it to understand each other rather than make rules around it. I think, I don't know.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:26.080
Absolutely. And I think once you start unraveling that thread, it's so cool where it leads because

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:30.560
you, you have these ideas about language that are formed from this weird thing you do in school,

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.040
right? You go to grammar class and that's really your only knowledge of language. If you think

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.520
about what have I learned about language in my lifetime? It is simply, I have learned that there

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.400
are nouns and there are verbs and how I'm supposed to string them in a sentence and that I'm not

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:49.360
supposed to end my sentences with prepositions or split my infinitives, because I learned this thing

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:54.800
in grammar class from the time I was five to the time I'm, you know, 25 or whenever you finish

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.840
graduate school or whatever you're doing. But we never learn about language as a system. We never

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:05.040
learn about language as a science. We never learn about language as a history. But all of those

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:10.960
things are what brought language to where it is today. They're, they're so much embedded in the

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.360
culture of language and the science of language that we could really learn from. And that's what

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.440
I was trying to do with my book. I'm trying to bring that history and that background and that

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:25.360
science out so that people can understand why we say the things we do. Where does light come from?

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:31.200
Well, like 300 years old. So it's pretty cool that we still use it today and it's not new. It's

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.600
not American. It's actually British. So, you know, these really cool little threads that once you

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.160
untangle them, it opens this whole new way of looking at language. It's very, very cool.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.400
Amazing. Valerie, it's been so incredible talking to you. Tell us once again the name of the book

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.640
and where people can get it. Sure. The name of the book is like literally dude, arguing for the

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:54.320
good and bad English. And you can buy it wherever books are sold, Amazon or your local bookstore.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.760
That's my preference. If you want to go give them some, some money and some book sales,

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.200
that would be great. But anywhere books are sold, you can find it. And of course, if you want to

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.320
buy it through our special bookshop, you can get it at factuallypod.com slash books, factuallypod.com

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.320
slash books. You'll be supporting not just the show, but also your local bookstore as well,

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.160
if you buy it from there. Valerie, we didn't even get to talk about dude. I'm afraid that people

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:24.880
will have to buy the book in order to learn about it. Dude. Well, dude, dude, I can't believe it.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.560
Thank you so much for being here, Valerie. Hope you'll come back again and talk to us about this
