00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me again. You know,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,520
if you're like me, you like to eat. In fact, you have to eat or you'll die. And you might have

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,960
noticed that food has been getting a lot more expensive. Although inflation for food has slowed

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,240
relative to 2022, you have to remember that the effects of inflation are cumulative. And recent

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,440
numbers showed increased prices for everything from frozen juice to ground beef. Eating out is

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,280
more expensive than last year. And even vending machine prices are up. It sucks. Again, we all

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,760
have to eat. And for most of us, living off the grid and growing our own meat and potatoes is not

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,440
an option. So ideally, we'd have a world where different food companies compete to get us the

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,080
lowest price, right? Well, unfortunately, just as with industries like newspapers, internet advertising,

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,080
airlines and athletic shoes, that competition doesn't exist anymore at all. Instead, our food

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,600
system is run by monopolies. And those monopolies have the power to screw us, whether we're their

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,800
customers, their workers or citizens living in places where they exert unfair and undemocratic

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,160
influence over our lives. I mean, I can't believe I have to say this, but food is simply one of the

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,320
necessities of life, which means it's a bad thing that only a few people in this country have control

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,480
over that necessity. You simply cannot explain how we get our beef, pork, grain, how grocery stores

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,840
work, why prices are higher than ever without understanding the influence of these massive

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,200
and manipulative companies. And luckily on the show today, we have a guest who knows everything

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,800
about it. And not only that is from one of the very regions that produces our essential food

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,000
stuffs. He not only knows about this, he has lived it himself. And I cannot wait for you to hear this

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
interview. But before we get to it, I just want to remind you that if you want to support this show

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,720
policy. He's a fellow at Yale and he is born and currently lives in Iowa right here in the United

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,160
States. His fantastic new book is called Barons, Money, Power, and the Corruption of America's

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,880
Food Industry. Please welcome Austin Frarick. Austin, thank you so much for being on the show,

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,920
man. Thanks for having me on, Adam. Okay, so tell me, what is so fucked up about America's Food System?

32
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,120
How radical it's become. You have one man in Iowa as the most powerful political person in the state

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,440
and he does five million hogs a year. I mean, not alone. He does five million hogs a year.

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,760
What do you mean by he does them? That could mean a lot of things, some of which I don't want a picture.

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,800
Yes, so he owns, so he has about 7,000 workers and employees at this point. A lot of them are

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
contractors. You got to be careful with the word workers, but he owns five million hogs. He has

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,280
other people grow them, but he maintains the ownership as they grow them out. But his operation

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,560
produces five million hogs a year. And how much of the American pork supply is that?

39
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,000
So he's the fourth largest pork producer in America. Basically in my lifetime,

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,760
you've seen the hog family farmer die, where you have the 10 largest entities

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,600
do about 70% of the hog market, control it, including the largest owner of hogs is actually

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,680
Chinese multinational, Smithfield. Is there a reason you're saying, by the way, hogs and not pigs?

43
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,760
I'm just very curious. Oh, no, I use them interchangeably.

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,880
Okay, I was like, is pigs wrong? Should I not be saying pigs? Do I look like city folk if I'm

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,120
saying pigs? Okay. Well, and so why is that a problem to have that be so monopolized in

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
so few hands that one person is doing, you know, is doing so many hogs?

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
So let's just take hogs and I, so I open my book opens with a hog Baron, this hog guy.

48
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,440
I know, isn't that first of all, it's not so. I'm sorry. The hog Baron is just, what a great

49
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,960
image. It sounds like an anime character or something like that. I imagine a guy with like a

50
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,520
top hat and there's like a little snout on the front. He's got some goggles and he's like,

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,760
hello, I'm the hog Baron oink oink. Like that's, what a great guy.

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,680
You got to put a little bit more Florida on him. So my hog Baron has like a Florida twist to him.

53
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,720
First of all, I find this campy. That's kind of why I like this framework is it,

54
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,080
you don't feel powerlessness because it's so morally ridiculous. And this whole thing started

55
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,800
because of him. It literally was in a bar in Des Moines, 2018, where someone, a political person

56
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,320
was complaining. I didn't know at the time, but like Iowa doesn't have campaign contribution

57
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,280
limits. So he had given the governor $300,000 for her campaign. Wow. And the thing that caught

58
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,840
my eye was, it was not even that, it was, he has a home in the rich suburb of Des Moines,

59
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,440
he has a home down in Naples, Florida, which says something, but he has a private jet that he flies

60
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,520
back and forth between the two. Wow. And I was like, that's power. That is like that imagery

61
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,240
says everything. But how did Iowa fall apart in my lifetime? And how do I tell this bigger

62
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,200
structural story with this little like trashy Florida man? So there used to be such a thing

63
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:10,320
as a family hog farmer. Now we have a hog baron, but there used to be a hog peasant or a hog,

64
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,440
small landowner, right? A hog family farmer. Yeah. And now those people now are low wage

65
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,800
workers for this baron. And instead of like, you know, having a relationship with the animal,

66
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,640
your job now is about 10% of the pigs die inside these muddle sheds. So you're paid to go in their

67
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,960
hall at the dead bodies to throw them into a dumpster. Wow. I mean, that is, that is where we

68
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,680
are now. But that's also like for those people in erosion in the middle class, right? Because if

69
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,640
you previously, I assume, were a hog farmer, you had some ownership of some land, of the animals,

70
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,360
of your production pipeline. You were a producer selling to somebody. And I imagine that that

71
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,440
you're able to make more money that way than when you're just a surf working for the hog baron.

72
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,160
Yeah. And you're spending your money locally, you're paying taxes, you're sending your kids to

73
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,880
school, and that's all gone. You see the massive consolidation of power. And honestly, the guy's

74
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,640
probably taking his money down the floor to knowing how this game works. And what happens is

75
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,080
it's basically modern day sharecropping. It really comes from chicken. They call it chickenization

76
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,800
and it's happened across the food system and it happened to pork. He saw that coming where I kid

77
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,480
you not a century ago when they wrote the regulations to tackle the main monopolies in

78
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,160
response to Upton's and Clare's the jungle. When they wrote the regulations, they didn't write

79
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,440
chicken into it because there weren't commercial chicken slaughterhouses. You just butchered a

80
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,640
chicken in your backyard. So down south, corporations took that model to black farmers

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,040
that a sharecropping model plighted the chicken. And then what you see is USDA didn't step in

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,720
saying chicken, you can't behave that way. And you see the chickenization of everything else.

83
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,600
Wait, so let's get a little bit of a bird's eye view of the history of American food production

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,960
because you started talking about, you dropped so many little historical bombs there, sharecropping,

85
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:52,160
the regulations in the Upton Sinclair era. So take us to the moment before Upton Sinclair,

86
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,120
what did things look like? Why did the regulations come in and then what did we live in?

87
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,200
What world of food did we live in after those regulations up until the present day?

88
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,800
Yeah, so I think actually meatpacking is a single best way to like talk about all this stuff because

89
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,760
it shows what the system could be and how it all falls apart. But let me also first start with

90
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,760
the notion that I want to be very careful about romanticizing the past in the food system because

91
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,040
in the day it's rooted in genocide and slavery. Yeah. But we did make progress. We really did

92
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,760
and you saw the meatpacking where we as a society were mad and angry at what we saw in the jungle,

93
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,320
the meat quality we were getting, and we made policy choices to break up these meat companies,

94
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,640
to empower the workers, and they got power. That became a solid middle-class job. People on both

95
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,400
sides of my family did that for a living. And then what we've seen since the election of President

96
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,120
Reagan is systematic assault on that industry, massive consolidation, where even in my book,

97
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,480
I have a slaughtering baron, this super corrupt Brazilian family where I would actually argue

98
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,000
they're the closest thing to a criminal organization in modern-day corporate America.

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,360
Wow. Which is saying a lot, but they actually pled guilty to bribing their way to monopoly

100
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,920
level status. And I'm not talking campaign bribes. I'm talking bribery. But they're now the largest

101
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,200
meatpacker in America. They're the largest meatpacker in the world's ever seen. And that's why we

102
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,160
see rampant use of child labor. We see all these bad things we tackled. This regulatory system

103
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,760
collapsed and we shouldn't be shocked that robber barons are filling that void.

104
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,760
So you said members of your family did this kind of work in maybe not the good old days,

105
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,280
but decades ago and made a living that way. So what did their lives look like compared to what

106
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,520
it looks like now? Yeah, I mean, my grandfather. My grandfather was kind of like my idol. He worked

107
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,760
at a hog plant town, the old Wilson's. They bought a home out in the country. He had a little acreage

108
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,680
I grew up. That's kind of actually why I lived farming and gardening is I grew up working his

109
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:46,160
plot with him. He owns his house. And nowadays, I mean, just even where I live, a lot of immigrants

110
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,000
and they live in section 8 housing. They're usually Sudanese and they work at either in

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,800
Tame or Waterloo, Iowa. They live two or three families to a two bedroom. You know what I mean?

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,000
My grandfather could buy a house, lived American dream and now these people are barely getting

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,240
by and where they live is actually most highly impoverished school district, sorry, school,

114
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,800
elementary in the city. It's just, it says so much of where we've become and it's incredibly

115
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,840
dangerous. And you add the whole layer on top of it of a lot of these workers either undocumented

116
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,920
or on the marginal thing of there's just so much abuse going on that we just don't even know about.

117
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,040
So how did this transition take place? How do we go from the world that your grandfather lived

118
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,120
into the world that these folks now inhabit? I mean, I just think we're living in a second

119
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,840
gilded age, just another Lazi Farah thing. And it's such a simple thing, but I realized sitting

120
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,160
in a biz school class a few years ago, the goal of any corporate executive is monopoly.

121
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,720
Period. And so like, you saw what they did regulatory capture, you know, the election

122
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,040
of Reagan was such a game changer of just, I know you had Lena Conn on. I mean,

123
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,960
that's like to me, this best way of hope right now is we're, we're moving away from that model,

124
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,320
but it allowed massive consolidation to occur where my coffee Baron in my book is a secret

125
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,280
German family that now sells more coffee than Starbucks, but didn't even sell it being a coffee

126
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,960
in America till 2012. They bought Panera, Caribou coffee, Ironsigns Bagels, Burgers Bagels, Curie

127
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,480
Cups, Stumptown, Telegencia, Krispy Kreme, you name it. They bought all of the worst bagel chains

128
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,160
as a lifelong New Yorker. They bought all the bagel chains I would never fucking eat at.

129
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,080
In my life, they have spongy bagels. They, they toast every single one of them. And, and along

130
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,800
with all these other chains as well. So, sorry, go on, please. No, I was just laughing because

131
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,080
that's like a hot point in my marriage. My husband agrees with you. I love Panera Crunch,

132
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,440
Panera Bread, Semina Crunch Bagel. My husband's from New York City.

133
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,760
It's fine if you, you know, if you got to eat in a mall, it's completely fine. I get it. But yeah,

134
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,720
please, please go on. Like, how did, yeah, how did this occur?

135
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,520
Robert Bork. I mean, there's always going to be hatchet men for industry. I mean,

136
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,720
there's always going to be academics doing the bidding of the rich. And he basically

137
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
flipped America's antitrust laws upside down. We had all these guardrails. Like,

138
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,480
what the coffee bearing did could not have been done just a few decades ago. You couldn't come

139
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,880
in and roll up a competitive industry. But when these guardrails came away where they came

140
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,600
both with this kind of junk science where consumer welfare standards, what they call it,

141
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
where you can show that prices go lower. For consumers, you can buy a company.

142
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,040
You can hire any economist to produce those numbers. And so you see massive consolidation

143
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,040
in meat packing, in coffee, in grain, in all these different industries. I actually think

144
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,000
food is the most concentrated industry in America because it's that illusion of choice.

145
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,120
You know what I mean? Like, if you look at the peanut butter area, there's actually one company

146
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,960
has about a 60% market share in peanut butter, but they have all these different brands.

147
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,400
Wow. 60% market share in peanut butter. Like, so Laura Scutter is not a real person. That's

148
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,400
what you're telling me. She's just part of some bigger conglomerate. She's actually owned by that

149
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,560
company. I think it's Smuckers. Smuckers invented Laura Scutter. I thought her name

150
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,280
too conveniently rhymed with peanut butter. I was looking at Laura Scutter, peanut butter.

151
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,360
There's no way that this lady was like, you know what? My name sounds like peanut butter.

152
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,040
Let me start an independent peanut butter company. There's a fake lady. This is why my mom hates

153
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,760
grocery shopping with me because I love telling her these little factoids when we shop.

154
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,240
Yeah, in the same way. I think we would have a good time at the grocery store together

155
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
because we'd spend about three hours there and never buy anything. We'd just be pointing at stuff

156
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,320
going, oh, you know what's fucked up about this? About this maple syrup or whatever.

157
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,080
I mean, even my favorite is probably my favorite chapter right was the grocery chapter because

158
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,400
I love them. But I had a grocery guy tell me, you got to think of a grocery store as modern-day

159
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,720
mafioso capitalism because even the shelf space, there is so much shenanigans going on what you

160
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,120
see at the eye level, like the whole slotting fees, all these games going on. It's incredible.

161
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:39,920
Yeah. So what happens? I know about the consumer welfare standard. Robert Bork puts out a very

162
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:47,280
influential paper called I believe the Antitrust Paradox, making the argument that all the antitrust

163
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,640
enforcement that we had for decades and decades in America that broke up monopolies and made

164
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,480
sure monopolies couldn't form actually was bad and that we shouldn't be applying it. And instead,

165
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,760
we should only break up a monopoly when the price is going to go up for consumers. If the price goes

166
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,800
down, it's okay. Yes. And then that has the advantage of being very easy for judges to

167
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,720
adjudicate, right? You just get an economist before a judge and the economist says, oh,

168
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,920
here's some numbers that say the prices go down. Well, the judge isn't an economist.

169
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,880
They're listening to, they're like, oh, you're an economist. All right. So if you say the prices

170
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,800
go down, I guess they'll go down. That's good enough for me. I'm just some fucking judge and

171
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,840
bangs the gavel and they allow the mergers to go through. And that's happened in so many different

172
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,680
industries. It's happened in my industry, the entertainment industry, so many others. But 60%

173
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,880
of peanut butter or all these coffee chains, that's a huge amount of consolidation. That would be

174
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,480
illegal if not for the sea change and antitrust enforcement. It's actually probably higher than

175
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,760
60% because a lot of times they do the store label and you only know as usually when there's a

176
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,680
peanut recall. Okay. You're totally, I mean, when you're explaining that whole

177
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,360
Robert Bork framework is to me, that's the hallmark of this era is big words to hide. I mean,

178
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,040
you're using complex language to keep people out to really hide shenanigans like consumer

179
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,400
welfare at standard. Those words mean nothing, but they sound really smart and it plays into

180
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,840
people's intellectual insecurity because they don't want you to know what they're doing. That's

181
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,160
all that is. Yeah. The consumer welfare standard is like, oh, that sounds like a big important

182
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,960
legal doctrine that very important smart people came up with. And you shouldn't argue with it.

183
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,440
And it gives the decision, the era of legitimacy. When in fact, to what it's much simply, they're

184
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,760
just saying, hey, let's let the mergers go through. It's junk science, masking moral judgments.

185
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,200
In the day, how many logs one man should own? That's a moral question we should wrestle with

186
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,640
as a democracy. Excel can't tell you that answer, but we pretend to do it.

187
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,720
Well, so give me more examples about why this is such a big problem in food. Again,

188
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,600
I know this is a larger economic problem, but what makes it so bad in the food system?

189
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
The workers, the workers are the ones being squeezed here the most.

190
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,200
That, I mean, that is the one that shocks people the most. My book is My Berry Baron,

191
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:57,040
Driscoll's. Your Berry Baron. Oh, Driscoll's. Driscoll's is in. Driscoll's is in my supermarket.

192
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,560
I buy Driscoll's all the time. They sell one in three berries in America.

193
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,120
But they don't grow a single berry, Adam. They sell one in three berries, but they grow zero

194
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,920
berries. Is that what you said? Yes. Yes. How is that possible? Chicken. They chickenized the

195
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,720
berry industry. And it's like a combination of Silicon Valley meets chicken. So they took

196
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,840
the Silicon Valley model of owning the IP. So they own the IP of the berry and then they contract

197
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,760
out production. And part of that chapter is I wanted to tell people a lot of the produce you

198
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,520
consume now is moved offshore because of these trade agreements where you can exploit labor,

199
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,520
exploit the environment. So, you know what I mean? How can you compete on price against

200
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:42,480
a 12 year old picking berries in like Baja, Mexico? Okay. Now I have to dwell on the question of IP.

201
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,800
You said there's IP in the berries, intellectual property. Now I'm used to that in Hollywood,

202
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,600
right? Like Batman is IP, you know? And so if I want to write a Batman movie, well,

203
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,440
guess what? I got to get permission. And also I'm not that important as the screenwriter or

204
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,760
the director. Batman's the star, right? Even the actor isn't that important. So IP is a real problem

205
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:06,800
where I work. What is the IP for the berry? Is the IP the name Driscoll's? Is it the,

206
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,760
or is it the berry itself? What the fuck are you talking about? Both. Because they want a branded

207
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,520
product. I mean, Driscoll's is kind of the first branded produce thing. Like you can't think of

208
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,080
name a branded Apple company. You really can't. But on top of it, I can name Apple varieties.

209
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,200
You're right. I can't, and I know some of those are proprietary, but I can't name

210
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,520
a company. I can name Chiquita Banana. That's one that I can think of that's maybe older.

211
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,360
But the key thing is, it's really about durability. What's really fascinating about Driscoll's,

212
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,960
it's really, you almost kind of have to blame Walmart. Like Walmart is the king of kings

213
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,200
and the creation of one robber baron makes other robber barons where Driscoll's saw the rise of

214
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,080
Walmart coming and realized Walmart wants one company to do four berries year round for 4,000

215
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,040
stores. And so that berry is not engineered for taste. So they patent, they make special types

216
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,280
of berries that either sometimes they're gone to Morocco, sometimes in Baja, sometimes in Chile,

217
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,480
but it's all about durability. How can you make that berry last as long as possible as it goes from

218
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,720
you know, Chile up to Vermont. Right. And those Driscoll's berries, like they taste

219
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,600
not great. I mean, you know, I was lucky enough, my parents gardened when I was a kid and we

220
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,200
would have strawberries fresh from the garden. They taste so strawberry either. Incredible,

221
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,160
you know, Driscoll's berries are like, you're like, I'm getting a, I'm getting a hint of strawberry.

222
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,720
I waft it, a wafting under my nose when I bite into this watery pink white berry, you know,

223
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,480
it's better than nothing. It's okay on corn flakes, but it's not like a berry berry. Right.

224
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,320
But that's the story of the food system is nothing tastes good anymore. I mean, that is like

225
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,560
writing this chapter, you know, I did a little tastings like, so I love milk, shocking.

226
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,200
Sorry, sorry, sorry. No, no, no, no, you look like a milk drinker. You look like a milk guy. I'm

227
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,040
a white boy from Iowa. Yeah, of course I'm gonna love my milk, but like inputs matter,

228
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,880
like inputs matter and like cow and pasture is going to make a very different tasting milk than

229
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,920
like an industrial cow inside a metal shed or in baker's field, you know, eating corn all day.

230
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,000
And that's a story across the food system. And on top of it, industry will love to say this makes

231
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,080
cheap food. That's not factually true. That's like maybe my favorite little factoid writing this

232
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,840
book is, oh, these are concentrated markets, concentrated markets, gouge, that's what they

233
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,320
do and we see rampant gouging across the food system. So we're paying more for garbage. Like

234
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,040
that is what blows my mind. Yeah, those just goes berries are not like cheap. They're still,

235
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,600
you know, berries are expensive to buy in the grocery store still. You don't get many, you know,

236
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,920
you pay, I don't know, like eight bucks a little tiny thing of blueberries last year,

237
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,280
you know, a smoothie and a half. You know, it's not, it's just like, I mean, but the thing is

238
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,880
this system is done by design. Like my maybe the hardest chapter, right? But one of my second

239
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,080
favorites is my farm by grain bearing chapter about the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill heavily

240
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,640
subsidizes grains. So it makes highly processed food cheap. But if you grow produce, you don't get

241
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,360
anything. And it also pushes people to grow grains and not produce. So it pushed produce

242
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,000
off the shore of America to other countries. And when supply chains get long, transparency

243
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,920
collapses. Like it's so stupid, but like part of the reason why I wrote that was I read an article

244
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,840
15 years ago where 70% of apple juice in America comes from China. Really? 70% of apple juice

245
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,480
in America comes from China. But I mean, American apple farming is still big. There's like America

246
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,840
makes a lot of apples. I get them in the grocery store. Many of them are good.

247
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,720
So why would the apple juice be produced in China when we're growing apples here?

248
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,640
Because then the biggest part of apples is labor. It's cheaper to hire someone over there,

249
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,480
ship liquid across the world. I mean, we still produce a lot of apples, but not as much as you

250
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,800
think. I mean, it's kind of, if you go to Trader Joe's, look at the back of every juice. You'll

251
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,160
notice a lot of them will say, Turkey, you know, pick your country. It's a labor component. It's

252
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,440
as we rave standards of living for farm workers here, it undermines, you know, it kind of pushes

253
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,240
people off. And even in Iowa, most of the orchards are gone that I grew up with, but they're not

254
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,200
subdivisions. They're just more corn and soybeans because that's where more of the subsidies are

255
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,200
going to. You know, and I've known for a while that we covered on my Netflix show the G word,

256
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,040
the fact that we subsidize certain foods and not others and that we subsidize these grains.

257
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,160
And the story that we presented is that it's somewhat of a historical accident that we

258
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,320
subsidize those particular grains as opposed to any other crops. And we don't subsidize healthy

259
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,200
fruits and vegetables. This is a very, it's a very simple story. We told it on television,

260
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,320
so it had to be sort of simple and quick. It's one I've read elsewhere. I did not realize that

261
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,520
that story though meant that we were, I thought we were just producing less vegetables, not that it

262
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,840
was getting pushed offshore. That's wild. Like if I'm buying broccoli or whatever, it's like more

263
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,080
likely now to come from a different country entirely. Yes. It took me a while to kind of,

264
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,360
I love, do you know what they're like census for people? Well, USA does its own agriculture

265
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,560
census and every seven years they do it. And you start pulling to the data and you just notice,

266
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,960
oh, there's some weird trend lines going on here. And even something simple as during the new deal,

267
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,360
one of the things they did, the workers progress administration is they commissioned state guides

268
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,680
they called them. I almost think of Wikipedia mixed with like travel. I was reading the Iowa one

269
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,360
and I was reading about all these different regional food productions. You're like, wait,

270
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,240
there used to be tons of peaches in Iowa. There used to be tons of onions. So food supply chains used

271
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,040
to be much more regional. And part of it is, to be fair, part of it is refrigeration. Refrigeration

272
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,000
was a game changer. It extended supply chains. But what this system does is it really pushes

273
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,120
people to specialize, but it makes them incredibly fragile. So like that's what happens is like you

274
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,360
used to just see like Del Mar Peninsula used to do a lot of the produce for the East Coast.

275
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,760
The Delta used to do some produce for the South. Now, ever all your strawberries in America used to

276
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,040
come from California. Well, now it's starting to shift away to Baja. You know what I mean? Like

277
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,840
California is increasingly nuts because that's just pure capital intensive.

278
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,240
Right. Like, sorry, when you say California is nuts, you're not referring to the craziness of

279
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,480
life in California, which I can vouch to. Let me be clear. Things are pretty wild here in the state

280
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,200
of which I live. Now, you're talking about in California, which is a huge agricultural state,

281
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,200
they are now mostly growing nuts. And part of that is because nuts are easily like financialized.

282
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,640
Like you can ship them really easily. They're worth a lot of money. Like almonds are very,

283
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,560
they're calorie dense. They are also money dense per unit of almond, right? Yep, totally. And then

284
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,600
it's easy to harvest. You don't really need people. They just have machines that can do a lot of the

285
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,920
work. So you don't need to pay someone to go up there and pull down the fruit. But that means

286
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,840
that a state like mine that used to have used farming used to be a big part of its economy

287
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,800
that people actually worked in. And that there's the famous farm worker unionization efforts of

288
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,040
the last century. Like it's part of the history of the state, the fucking dust bowl migration,

289
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,720
all this shit. This is like part of what California is. Now it's just the same amount of land,

290
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,840
but it's being used with these giant machines to farm almonds just for a couple of people to

291
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,200
profit at the top rather than something that's benefiting everybody in the economy. Yeah, in

292
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,600
California, speaking of nuts, so it's just, it's a different food system. And it took me as a

293
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,000
Midwesterner a while to get my head around. Like there's a lot of problems with like the

294
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,240
homestead act and stuff, but it established like de concentrated power, especially in land holdings.

295
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,720
California, on the other hand, has always been colonial. Like you drive the central valleys,

296
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,480
you don't see farmhouses in the fields. And like, right, you start, I mean, you write a book like

297
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,600
this, there's so much stuff that ends up in the cutting room floor. I got obsessed with the water

298
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,240
stuff in California. Like the whole Imperial Valley makes no sense to me. Yeah, I mean,

299
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,920
yeah, it's crazy the way water has been redirected across the state, specifically to the in the most

300
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,720
popular state in the country. And by the way, I live in the most populous county in the country

301
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,080
as well, which is enormously thirsty of water, constantly in a drought state. But part of that

302
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,440
is because so much the water is directed to these farms that are owned again by one or two people

303
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,600
as their sort of personal wealth creation. Do you cover the, you cover the Resnicks in the book?

304
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,400
So I knew you're going to say that. I have a whole B list of Barons that didn't make the cut.

305
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,000
There's already been a lot of good. You're calling the Resnicks B list Barons,

306
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,680
the almond and pomegranate Barons of California. You're calling them B list. Hey, screw you,

307
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:17,520
man. These are these are great. These are some of the greatest robber Barons in the American economy.

308
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,880
Stuart Resnick and his wife, whose name I forget, they steal water from all across the state.

309
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,280
They're like making huge amounts of almond milk. Caliphia almond milk is them. Pome wonderful is

310
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,320
them. They've created company towns across of like where they, you know, force people to live

311
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,800
like on their property, right? They're horrible people. And I can't believe they didn't make

312
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,000
your list. I've insulted as someone who lives in California. You want to hear the

313
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,680
Resnick on your list? Have you seen my ass? Have you seen their new product?

314
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,920
What is their new product? Seedless lemons. Seedless lemons?

315
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,520
Because Americans, they're too lazy. They don't like the seed in their lemons. So like,

316
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,680
there's something evil. Like, this is the weirdest thing to say. Some of these Barons,

317
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,440
you have to kind of admire like the bullshit of it all. Like, that's kind of brilliant.

318
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,920
And it's, I mean, that's the funny thing about writing this book. Sorry, I shouldn't say funny,

319
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,920
but people tell me, oh, you got, when I was in Minnesota, like, you got, let me tell you about

320
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,160
this potato baron. When I was in Indianapolis, they told me about this carrot baron. You're just

321
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,480
like, it's so ridiculous that we have this. I mean, the Resnicks are, it sounds weird when I wrote,

322
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,320
when I structured this book, I wanted to mix up the narrative. So I have trashy money, then I go

323
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,680
aristocratic money, then trashy. You know what I mean? Like, you don't want to do the same story

324
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,640
over and over. The Resnicks kind of have this, they're like Cargill to me. They have this like

325
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,880
Greenwich, like they understand image construction in a way that my hog bearing doesn't give a

326
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,760
fuck about. Yeah. Yeah, they're very, they make themselves look good, right? There's a lot of,

327
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,200
they do a lot of donations and things like that. They make themselves look like upstanding pillars

328
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,840
of the community. Even in the products themselves, I mean, these people are one of the pioneers of

329
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:05,200
almond milk. And, you know, almond milk is wildly popular. And it is not great environmentally,

330
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,520
right? Because the almonds take so much water to make. It's like, you know, a bunch of almond,

331
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,200
but then it just, it's just almond plus water. And it took water to grow the almonds.

332
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:20,080
But they have like the, you know, the Caliphia almond bottle. It looks so wholesome and happy.

333
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,480
Oh, there's no, there's no cows involved. So it's good for me. Like it's got a, it's got a halo to

334
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,680
it. Oh, my favorite, I mean, their best product is obviously Fiji water. Oh, they're Fiji water as

335
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,480
well. I forgot about that. Let's ship water from halfway across the world and branded as bougie

336
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,400
and like sell people for like, you know, that's, that's where we are right now.

337
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,520
Hey folks, this week's sponsor is one of my favorites on this show. I endorse them whole

338
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,240
heartedly. And in fact, I have been using their product since long before this podcast even existed.

339
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,680
That's right. I'm talking about delete me. You know, you might not want to hear this,

340
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,800
but it has got to be said, your data is out there. There is a whole thriving ecosystem of

341
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,640
data brokers, people who collect, buy and sell our personal information on the internet right

342
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,720
now. That means your name, your phone number, your home address, the names of your relatives

343
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,200
and your friends is almost certainly out there waiting to be snapped up by anyone with an

344
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,800
internet connection. These sites are real. I have been to them myself and I've seen my own

345
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,520
information on them. And I've talked before about how exposed I felt when I realized that

346
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,680
people were literally buying my home phone number from these data brokers. And frankly,

347
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,080
I wouldn't wish that feeling on anyone. It was after that incident that I signed up for delete

348
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,960
me and I have not regretted it even for an instant ever since. But since then, the prevalence of

349
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,520
harassment and online bullying has only seemed to escalate. It seems like every single week I hear

350
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,840
a story about a real life incident that began as an argument or interaction between two strangers

351
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,520
on the internet or about some kind of stalking that began online. You deserve to feel secure and

352
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,760
anonymous on the internet and not have to be anxious about scammers, finding your phone number,

353
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,760
phishing attempts being sent to your email or strangers, knowing how to find your front door

354
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,160
step. So for that reason, I urge you to check out delete me, not just for your security, but for

355
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,600
your friends and family too. Their teams of experts scour the internet. They remove your and your

356
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,560
family's information from those data broker sites. They send you a report every single 90 days. It

357
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,800
really works. I can tell you it is true. Okay. And get this, you can get 20% off your delete me plan

358
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,920
when you go to join delete me dot com slash Adam and use promo code Adam at checkout. That's join

359
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:28,080
delete me dot com slash Adam promo code Adam. Hey, did you know that learning actually makes a sound?

360
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,160
It's true. Listen, that's the sound of you mastering a new language with Babel. Learning a new language

361
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,080
can be one of the toughest yet most rewarding challenges out there. So if you are ready to

362
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,400
dive in, make sure you're using the right tools to get the job done. A lot of language apps are

363
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,640
really just kind of games that are dressed up to make you feel like you're learning. Babel is

364
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,000
different though. It is the real deal. Lessons in Babel are crafted by real people for real

365
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,880
conversation. They're approachable with tips and tools that are all based in real life and framed

366
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,240
around conversation based teaching from minute one. Babel is concerned with helping you get out there

367
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,960
and put a new language into practice in the real world. I mean, look, I've lived in Los Angeles

368
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,480
for years and a ton of people here speak Spanish and starting Spanish with Babel has been rewarding

369
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,880
to me in ways that I didn't even anticipate. I mean, sure, it's made chatting with neighbors and

370
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,800
ordering food and enjoying cultural events easier to do, but more importantly, it's also just

371
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,840
enriched my experience of living in Los Angeles and has made me feel more connected to my community

372
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,720
in a way I didn't expect. It makes me excited to learn more and see what else it opens up for me.

373
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,200
Now, that's just my experience. But studies from Yale, Michigan State University and others

374
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,560
have shown that Babel is effective. One study even found that using Babel for 15 hours is equivalent

375
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,280
to a full semester of a college language course. And look, I can't promise that it'll be easy,

376
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,720
but I can promise you'll be glad you did it. And get this, here is a special limited time deal

380
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,840
Yeah. And speaking of shipping, you know, these liquids halfway across the world,

381
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,760
I mean, it's ridiculous to be shipping so much food across the country or across the world in

382
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,720
cargo containers, right? I think about this every time I drink a Pellegrino and I like

383
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,240
a Pellegrino. It makes me feel classy, you know, to have a sparkling water at dinner.

384
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,800
But I'm like, a La Croix just comes from Wisconsin. Why do I need it shipped from Italy,

385
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,040
right? That's a lot more fossil fuels to have just like water brought from one place to another.

386
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,760
There's water here, motherfuckers. Like, why do I need it to come on a boat? And the same thing

387
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,440
is, it has to be true of apple juice and all these other products as well, right?

388
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,960
Yeah, because it's all about exploiting labor. I mean, it's this whole neoliberal trade stuff.

389
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,880
I mean, that is the trade component to the food system has been really underappreciated. I mean,

390
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,960
even if you go back to Baja and the berries, these are like, it's hard to use these words,

391
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,600
like almost like plantations, because people don't live a Baja. It's very sparsely populated.

392
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,680
It gets as much rain as Death Valley three inches a year. They bring in indigenous workers from

393
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:13,040
Oaxaca. It's so dangerous to go report this to be a journalist down there. They're plantations,

394
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,680
you know what I mean? They build desolidation plants on the ocean. They pull up the water,

395
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,960
they drain the aquifers. The people there don't eat the berries, they're for rich,

396
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,200
you know, they're for upper class Americans at Costco.

397
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,640
Wow. So they're literally, they're almost like terraforming,

398
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,680
like they're doing it on the surface of Mars or something. I mean, Baja California is a wonderful

399
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,880
place, but it's not suited to this kind of agriculture. They're just like, oh, here's

400
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,040
some cheap land with some cheap people. Let's just like get some water from somewhere else

401
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,920
or drain it out of the aquifer and we can grow our cash crop.

402
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,080
Yeah. It's that financialization, short term, private equity kind of thing where,

403
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,040
I mean, you get a massive amount of pig production in the Oklahoma Panhandle,

404
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,720
where like the dust bowl took place and pigs are thirsty or even you go to fucking,

405
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,240
sorry, you go to baker's field and it's like massive amount of dairy, dairy going on there.

406
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,520
And you're like, this doesn't make sense. I see an oil rig next to a dairy cow standing

407
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:04,480
in sand in the desert. Yeah. I mean, every time, you know, drive that freeway route from LA to

408
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,080
San Francisco, it's like the most, it's the weirdest part of the whole drive. You go through

409
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,120
that sea of cows and it was like something is not right here and also the air smells bad.

410
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,760
Yeah. I mean, like, but people don't realize that is dairy existed in Vermont, Wisconsin,

411
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,400
upstate New York for a reason. It made environmental logical sense. When you put it in the desert,

412
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,320
New Mexico does three times more dairy than Vermont now. And it's all over on the eastern

413
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,360
side by Texas near Clover. And it's just, these are industrial feedlots. And I mean,

414
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,640
dairy's really scary because these guys are kind of like feudal lords too because

415
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,880
they employ, it takes a lot of undocumented men to run these empires. They're usually also the

416
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,000
landlords. So they're both an employer and the landlords are usually the largest employer in the

417
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,240
county. I talked about my dairy bear and created that milk fair life. I don't know if you've ever

418
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,320
seen, it's like that branded milk in the grocery store. Coke just bought it for him. It's twice

419
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,520
the cost, half the volume of normal milk because it has high protein content. So young men love it.

420
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,000
It's, that's where we are. And when you say that, let's talk more about the financialization,

421
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,440
like that this is driven by the market, driven by private equity. How much is that the case?

422
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,680
Is it, yeah, describe how that process might work. I mean, part of it is, so like intellectual,

423
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,600
I came at this of you, to me, I really believe you have to understand how someone amassed power

424
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,960
to deconstruct it. And like, there's this, the simple stupid story is, oh, this was efficiency,

425
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,600
this was technology. But when you actually step back and you dig into it, you're like, no,

426
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,640
this is an old fashioned story of a combination of regulatory capture and access to cheap capital.

427
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,880
My hog Baron, he saw the industrial model taking hold, he was building some of those

428
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,800
metal sheds, he got some Wall Street money, and he was able to essentially get big when you saw

429
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,480
market changing. And then he established his market dominance. And then with that dominance,

430
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,560
he's able to essentially set the regulatory structure. Like he's given that money to the

431
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,640
governor of Iowa, that much money, because his whole empire is Iowa, he needs to control Iowa,

432
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,640
because the second you regulate hog manure, like human manure, his models no longer economically

433
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,440
viable, like, I can't say this, this fact blows my mind where like, I was 25 million hogs now,

434
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,080
and a hog defecates three times more than us. That's the manure of 75 million people. That's

435
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,640
California, Texas, Illinois combined. And that regulatory structure is gutted. Like there's

436
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:18,240
how many people live in Iowa? Three, three million, three million. So you got three million people

437
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,760
doing three million pounds of people shit. And then you've got 25 million hogs doing the equivalent

438
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:31,520
of 75 million pounds of people shit. Yes. So you're saying Iowa is something like what like

439
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:41,040
like, like, like seven eighths shit. Yes. Excuse me, excuse me, Iowans, but like the math there

440
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,400
is boggling my mind. It's the waterways in Iowa and open to her. Wow. No, I was gonna say like

441
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,480
seven percent of the waterways are too toxic to go into. You see these, there's manure lagoons

442
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,760
underneath them, and they occasionally leak, and you're like, no city would occasionally

443
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,360
leak human manure everywhere. And you know what I mean? It's such a fact of life. Yeah. And so you

444
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,560
say that the hog manure, despite there being many times more, we're talking 20 times more of it than

445
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,640
there is a human manure. Human shit is regulated. It can only be put certain places. It has to be

446
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,040
treated certain ways, not the case with hog shit. Yes. I mean, my favorite little example of this is

447
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,920
I go to, I fly a lot. It's like these coasts for like different stuff. And I, there's no

448
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,920
straight flight out of Iowa, shocking. And when I do that flight between Cedar Rapids and Chicago,

449
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,560
you're flying, especially in the winter, you fly over snow fields, fields covered in snow. And

450
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,240
you'll just see hog shit. Because what they do is they, every few months, you have to drain it. And

451
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,960
you're not really supposed to drain it and put it on snow in the winter. Because then when the snow

452
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,800
melts, it goes straight into the water. They do it. It's an, everyone knows they do it, and they

453
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,960
don't get fined for it. It's an open secret. But the worst one's actually in North Carolina,

454
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,600
because this is where the hog model comes out of, was a state senator deregulated this industry

455
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:51,360
in the eighties first. And he did it in the poor black areas. And because of the water table in

456
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,360
North Carolina and Iowa, they injected into the soil they put on top of it. In North Carolina,

457
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:00,720
they spray it into the air, the manure. So there's all these stories of spray it into the air.

458
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,960
Like, like they're watering the land. Wow. And so all the, and so there's stories of,

459
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,080
oh yeah, stories of these poor black churches having to repaint their steeples every few years

460
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:14,960
because they turn brown. Jesus Christ. Just turn brown from the hog shit. Yeah. You can't, I mean,

461
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,960
it's, people don't realize how the, how much destructive the quality of life is. And the way

462
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,040
these things, they're so, these states are so captured, you can't stop the construction of

463
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,720
these confinements when they go up. So your home is your everything in America. It's your wealth.

464
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,520
If one of those metal sheds full of piggies get built, you're fucked. Like, you can't do anything

465
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,280
about it. And it just destroys your wealth, destroys your quality of life. It traps you inside.

466
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:43,200
And one thing that really strikes me is how invisible this has become to mainstream America,

467
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,920
because you've got the destruction of the family farmer. That means that, well, you've got like

468
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,040
one guy owning an entire part of the food system. And then everyone working for him,

469
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,000
as you say, is an undocumented immigrant, someone with, you know, who's maybe here short term,

470
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,840
or maybe they don't speak English. They're, you know, they're not, they're not able to vote.

471
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:07,520
They're not, or they're living on some sort of weird company town, often, you know, the,

472
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,600
the central valley of California or Baja California, well, that's a different, different

473
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,480
country, but you get my point. And the people eating the food have no visibility because

474
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,880
there's been this, like, disconnect between the people making it and the people eating it.

475
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,960
Is that, does that sound right to you? Totally. I mean, like, to me, the bigger

476
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,760
tooth, just to add on to that is like one, you have local news collapse in these, in places

477
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,160
like Iowa. I mean, the one retro got gutted by private equity, Sinclair owns most of the TV stations.

478
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,680
So these stories aren't being told, they're not being reported out. So then the Robert

479
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,280
Barron essentially creates his own narrative. Like, I kind of think of Iowa, rural America,

480
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,600
now is like an extraction colony where the, like, the colonizers set the narrative.

481
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,080
Right. So these stories aren't told. And on top of that, you have a lot of news outlets in New

482
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,920
York City want to talk about what's the new high end restaurant. Like, there's not these structural

483
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,840
undercurrent stories. It's like, what's the new vegan restaurant in Brooklyn, you know?

484
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,480
Yeah, that's food journalism. Yeah. Yes. But it's easy. It's cheap. And on top of it,

485
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,040
my hog baron has his own spokeswoman. So like, there's this whole propaganda apparatus that

486
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,360
just licks them up and down all day. And I mean, my favorite, sorry, my favorite little,

487
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,200
my husband, I have these gay little sassy lines in the book I kind of love. And

488
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,200
in my hog baron chapter, Mike, Mike Rowe did a dirty jobs episode on my hog, my dairy baron.

489
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,240
I love that. By the way, you keep saying my hog baron, my dairy baron. You're really attached

490
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,200
to these people. You love them. I feel like you're, I just imagine you in your home,

491
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,120
like just with their pictures on the wall, like little shrines to them everywhere. Like,

492
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,200
you love these people. Oh, I'm like, I had a, actually a writer buddy of mine called me out on

493
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,680
that a few months ago, too, because it's had, I mean, I spent five years on this and I read

494
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,640
thousands of articles just to kind of get my head around it. Yeah. You get a vibe. You get a flavor

495
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,560
of them. You just kind of get to know what type of person they are. And like, I know that type

496
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,680
of guy, my dairy barons, I call them Bubba's, just that arrogant white guy that thinks they build

497
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,520
everything. I mean, so many of these guys cosplay as farmers, but they're really capital asset

498
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,480
managers. And like, he goes on dirty jobs, sells his narrative of being a farmer. And then I dig

499
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,560
into it and you're like, Oh, you actually claim residency at the Ritz Carlton, Puerto Rico,

500
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,960
probably to evade capital income taxes. And then like, and then my line on that,

501
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,320
my line is Mike Rowe sold his narrative. Like he used to sell products on QVC.

502
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:32,560
Because it's just like, yeah, Mike Rowe, the guy from Dirty Jobs famously, if people don't know,

503
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,000
you know, part of the right wing information machine, like he's, you know, been funded for

504
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,200
years by all the biggest right wing billionaires and, you know, pushing, has always pushed a

505
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,960
really pro corporate message on that show and on his other products, which is, you know,

506
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,920
that's his right to do as a communicator. I push a narrative that I find more true than that. But

507
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,160
that is, that is his ideological and historical role in the world.

508
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,640
Yeah. I mean, I did your thing. I didn't know that though. I just, I was in an Oklahoma watching

509
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,120
a Top Gun a few years ago. I was like there for something. I was at a theater and he cut an

510
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,880
ad before the movie, seeing how great fracking was for Oklahoma. But it was like the most

511
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,520
delusional ad I've ever seen. And you're like, because he's one of those people, my parents

512
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,400
always have them on like, it's like storage or just kind of on in the background.

513
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah. It's a good show. It's got this hidden ideological message that people don't usually

514
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,160
appreciate. That and like, to me, the truth was so obvious. That's what actually bothered me the

515
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,600
most about the Dairy Baron is they got a lot of press for how environmental sustainable they were.

516
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,680
And you just go to their operation. It's about an hour south of Gary, Indiana.

517
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,800
And it's just so obviously wrong. Like, I've never seen a Midwest cornfield with canals around it.

518
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,800
You're like, wait, what's going on here? And you Wikipedia, literally Wikipedia,

519
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,640
and this was an old wetlands. It was Everglades at the North. Teddy Roosevelt used to go hunting

520
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,360
here. This shouldn't be in row cropping production. And to do intensive dairy work,

521
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,400
dairy cows, we talk about hogs maneuvering a lot. Dairy cows do an insane amount more

522
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,920
where that dairy operation he's a part of has about 35,000 cows. Those cows do as much manure

523
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,600
in a day as the city of Austin, Texas. Wow. He's doing that in a wetland.

524
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,400
I mean, well, so let's talk again about the people who are doing the work for these guys.

525
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,800
Because, look, I mean, Trump is out there right now saying he's going to deport every

526
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,040
undocumented immigrant in America. But that's his policy. He wants to deport all of them.

527
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,480
And Biden has moved far to the right on immigration. There's almost a growing consensus

528
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:41,440
about like deportation. At the same time, our food system is built entirely on the backs of

529
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,400
these undocumented workers who are doing work that no middle class American would ever agree to do

530
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,920
at the wages that are being paid. And part of the work was basically invented for undocumented

531
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,240
people to be underpaid doing. And so how does that interact with our politics? I mean, just tell me

532
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,080
about that piece of it. It seems insane to talk about deporting these people when like,

533
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,800
where would you get your fucking driscals? That is the irony of it all. I mean,

534
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,040
my Dairy Baron gave a massive trek to Trump right after the excess Hollywood tape came out.

535
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,920
But it's like, dude, you're all empires and documented workers. I mean, even writing this

536
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,160
book, I discovered a worker died in his manure pit. Wow. It was a Honduras man, had three children,

537
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,960
it was never reported. It took me like two, three years to get the death records on him because

538
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,000
the power he wields in the county. That's the irony of it all. I mean, that's a thing I wrestled

539
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,240
with writing in the coffee chapter was, and I think this has been lost history is

540
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:46,400
the role monopolists play in financing fascists. And I danced around that in the book where Tim

541
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,920
Wu had this good book called Curse of Bigness, where he kind of mentioned it briefly. Yeah,

542
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,440
that book's incredible. Yeah. That's where I got a bunch of the argument that I told you about

543
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,280
Robert Borker from. Yeah. Yeah. And so he, but he had this little nugget in there that I dug

544
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,080
more into. After World War II, a big part of America's reconstruction in Japan and Europe was

545
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,920
trust busting. Like Congress commissioned a report and they're like, how did this happen?

546
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,800
One of the key findings were monopolist finance fascists. Hitler's largest owner was a company

547
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,640
called IG Farben. IG Farben was a chemical company. Hitler comes into a room and goes,

548
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,560
oh, I'll help you sell more chemicals, whatever. I don't mean all the crazy rhetoric. They cut

549
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,120
him a check. They sell him chemicals, including chemicals using gas chambers. That company's

550
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,200
broken up into seven. One of the modern day companies that was broken up into is, is, uh,

551
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,280
Bermont Santo. I just think that history is so important, especially now. And I think

552
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,760
because I'm from Iowa, I kind of saw where it all fell apart. Like Iowa should be the Italy

553
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,200
of North America. It should be the Napa. It should be where you go for food tourism yet

554
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,880
as a second highest cancer rate in America. It's one of the most obese states. The politics of

555
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,880
rage have filled the void of what used to be a solid middle class place of what used to be a

556
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,840
purple state. And we don't have to go down this path, but this is the path we're on. And like,

557
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,320
that is a goal I really wanted to have with this book is here's an honest conversation

558
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:02,960
where we are, but what we could do too. That's amazing how these barons have inflamed our politics

559
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,440
while keeping all the attention away from them, right? Like the, uh, the public, a lot of the

560
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,920
public is so angry about illegal immigration and undocumented immigrants. But like, why are

561
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,400
undocumented immigrants taking those jobs? Because these barons have created a job that

562
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:25,680
only an undocumented immigrant would take. That that is so poor and has done so by, uh,

563
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:31,120
fucking with the food system of the food that we eat. And so this is a problem that's entirely

564
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:36,640
created by them. And yet the public is angry at the victims, at the people who are dying in the

565
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,080
manure pits, uh, so that we can eat worse food, not all so that these guys on top can make more

566
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,600
money. It's insane. The bearing that it's the scariest is because how unknown they are is actually

567
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,160
Cargill. So Cargill is owned by the largest private company in America. They're bigger than the Koch

568
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,400
Brothers, but no one knows who they are. I mean, I didn't even have them in my business. Like when

569
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,480
I laid out the book and I grew up around Cargill. I was born next to a Cargill plant. I played soccer

570
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,040
next to a Cargill plant. My church was next to a Cargill plant. And they're, they're all about

571
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,280
owning the middle because they're not consumer-facing. You don't know who they are, but they have so

572
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,600
much money and power. And what they do is they engage, like I call it, um, they use middle man.

573
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,320
So they never do things overly. They pay these DC groups to do their bidding so they can play,

574
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,400
you know, be ignorant. You don't mean to play, you know, lead, um, what sort I'm looking for,

575
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,880
innocent, but it's currently dark. I mean, that is the fear of concentrated economic power is

576
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,360
you just assume it corrupts the local system. Yeah. Well, let's talk more about how this affects

577
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:37,520
the food that we actually eat in so many ways. Like the financialization, the monopolization

578
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,720
has actually altered the food itself, right? I mean, if I can give you a personal example of this.

579
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,120
I, uh, uh, last year was an upstate New York. I was on a college campus. The college campus had

580
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:53,120
some apple trees. It was like a historic apple orchard on it. And so they had some apples out,

581
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,200
like in the cafeteria, and they were like, Oh, you can have some, here's a Macintosh apple.

582
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,600
And I took the Macintosh apple and I bit it. And I was like, this tastes nothing like a Macintosh

583
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:08,960
apple I've ever had in my life. It was like crisp and juicy and had like, uh, had a complexity

584
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,360
of flavor. It makes me sound like a food nerd. I'm not trying to be snobby about it.

585
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,000
There was literally something going on with this apple I had not tasted before. Whereas every other

586
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,400
Macintosh, one of the most popular apple varieties in America I had had before had tasted almost

587
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,560
exactly the same. And you know, I'm sure this apple was fresher because it was local and da,

588
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,520
da, da. But also I was like something about the genetics seem different. Something like

589
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,560
everything about this apple was different to me. And it made me just reflect on there are all these

590
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,520
ways that the mechanized, financialized food system changes what we actually eat without

591
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:47,040
us realizing it until we finally have the counter example. I mean, but that's, I'm obsessed with

592
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,520
owning the middle with this book is how radical the system has become. And like part of owning the

593
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,040
middle and like, what we're talking about these reforms are like, Oh my God, animals should be

594
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,800
on the land. What a radical concept. Oh, food should be grown near you. Food should taste good.

595
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,680
People should get a decent living wage. We've gone so far off track. And I will say,

596
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,240
as dark as this can be, what gives me hope is everyone's seen it's not working. Like the biggest,

597
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,160
the thing that's kind of shocked me the most is how much the business traveler has taken to my book.

598
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,920
It's like a cliche for upper class Americans to go, Oh, I went to Italy, I ate better food,

599
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,400
I lost weight, you know, it's cheaper. Yeah, I mean, everyone's just kind of seeing it. It's

600
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,720
not working. And yeah, that is like, I mean, I had my one on Glenn Beck's TV network recently.

601
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,080
I mean, there's like this weird, there's this whole weird thing going to on the,

602
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:37,200
on the right right now over food. I mean, it's a little raw, milky RFK.

603
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:44,160
Yeah, no, but they've gotten it's sort of like the crunchy, you know, California hippies who got

604
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,560
kind of right wing have influenced the rest of the right wingers to get a little bit more crunchy.

605
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:54,080
And now they are really obsessed with the food system in a surprising way. I realized this

606
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,280
when I did a segment about for Adam ruins everything. And it was a pretty light segment.

607
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,080
It was just like, Hey, you can eat bugs if you want it, you know, like bugs are not that bad

608
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,600
for you. A lot of cultures eat bugs, there's bugs in the food you already eat. It's a good

609
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:12,960
source of protein, just like a fun light segment. And a bunch of right wingers, a bunch of right

610
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,360
wing blogs freaked out. And we're like, Adam Conover says you should eat bugs. And I realized that

611
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,960
they have some sort of like meme about how in the future we'll all be forced to eat like we're on the

612
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,400
snowpiercer train or something. And we're going to be forced to eat, you know, soylent green or

613
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,600
whatever. Like they're like, they have like a an apocalyptic future in mind. And I accidentally

614
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,400
like triggered them and their fear of being forced to eat bugs. And I wasn't aware of that until

615
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,800
that moment. I've seen ever since that was maybe five years ago, I've seen more and more of this

616
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,560
throughout the right wing. They're like obsession with the food system and purity and back to the

617
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:53,680
land and that kind of thing. Oh, I mean, just two things add on to that. One, I laugh because

618
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,400
Cargill's getting into the bug industry. They're trying to as a protein source to feed industrial

619
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:05,440
animals. So they want to as like soy, they kind of replace soybeans and corn is just feed the pigs

620
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,400
inside these metal sheds bugs, which is like a whole new separate thing. But that's actually why

621
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,560
I like book talks to your point, because you it's pattern recognition. You're like, why am I getting

622
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,840
a lot of questions about raw milk? Why am I getting a lot because people come up to you, they have

623
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,800
this conversation one on one, you're testing your rhetoric. I mean, that's actually where I get the

624
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,200
probably gossip for the book or like tips. It's just people like, oh, you should really look over

625
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,360
here. Like I did a book event in the hometown of my hog Baron. And it was the one time I was actually

626
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:37,040
scared shitless. I put the tracking on my phone. You're scared shitless because there was so much

627
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,480
shit surrounding you. You were ankle deep and shit. That's why you were scared shitless.

628
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,440
Or I could be floating in the next day, you know, like some little Chinatown thing goes down.

629
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:53,760
Please go on. But I was just that night I was the scariest I've been in the book tour because

630
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,520
like, I didn't expect doing this book tour was every place an old lady would always ask me,

631
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,760
are you worried about your safety? And honestly, I'm not in that I can say that it's honestly

632
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,320
the beauty of America is I can write a book like this and not be worried about my safety.

633
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,000
That said that town is like, I'm going into the heart of the beast. I'm going to a town of 5,000

634
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,360
people and I was to do a book talk. I was shocked. We had 50 people show up and to get 50 people at

635
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:24,080
a book talk in 2024 is a big deal. It was just people pissed off. And they were about more than

636
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:30,080
half the room came up to me afterwards. Oh, I knew I knew Jeff and they promised me this. They did

637
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,240
that. They did, you know, you could just see the anger and the sadness and people's face and like

638
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,800
that's also something I've internalized writing this book is there's a degree of Stockholm syndrome

639
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,800
in real America that I don't think urban America appreciates. A lot of people fought power and

640
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,920
they lost and like, you can't afford to leave. It's too depressing to really grapple with this

641
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,480
material. There's still some fighters. I opened with a book of a pissed off old woman fighting it.

642
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,760
Usually the fighters still are pissed off old ladies in rural areas, but it's hard. But it's

643
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,200
a weird, these people are barely getting by and you can just feel the pain. I don't know. I don't

644
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:07,120
know how to describe that, but it's just something I've noticed. Yeah. Well, I think we have all

645
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,240
felt that that there's something is deeply wrong with our food system. And, you know, we had a,

646
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,800
you know, when we cover on the show, what has happened to us health wise because of food,

647
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,800
the blame and to me always falls on the food system, on the capitalist food system that has,

648
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,160
you know, given us all of these foods that are very delicious to us, but are extremely unhealthy.

649
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,240
But more importantly, even the foods that are healthy have gotten less healthy, right? All the

650
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,440
meats have gotten, like they're produced less healthily for the people who produced them, but

651
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,920
also for us. Do you have any particular examples of that? And do you think that the process that

652
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,080
you're talking about here, this baronization, this chickenization of the food system is to

653
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:50,560
blame for our poor health outcomes? Oh, 100%. I mean, it takes money now to be healthy in America.

654
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,680
Yeah. One of the hardest sections where I was actually the obesity section in my green barons

655
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,400
chapter where it all goes back to corn and chicken, I joke. Yeah. But like,

656
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,600
just before corn syrup really took hold in America, we didn't have, I mean, sugar was hard to do.

657
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,640
Sugarcane has a very limited production region like Louisiana and Florida,

658
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,320
and sugar beets actually has this weird new DL supply management system where it's like,

659
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,200
there's quotas basically on how much you can produce. And but then the creation of corn syrup

660
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:22,000
in the 70s and 80s and the highly amount of subsidies going into it just exploded the use of

661
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,040
sugar. Julia Guthman is an academic at the University of Santa Cruz has done a lot of

662
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,680
scholarship on this and really drove that point home. But I mean, I, I see, I mean,

663
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,080
that's why I love going to grocery stores because you can just see the price points.

664
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,680
You see, you walk down the pop aisle and you're like, a two litters of buck 50,

665
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,040
but if I want carrot juice at $6, you're pushing people into it. And I don't want

666
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,560
an interview for this book that got junked. And it's because there's this elitism among

667
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,640
certain people where they blame the lower income person for their obesity. And I was like,

668
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,960
you don't get it. You don't get what it's like to work two jobs, have kids,

669
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:03,040
and this food is easy. It's easy to cook a frozen pizza. I mean, I, I grew up on that stuff. I mean,

670
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,920
it's, it's hard. Yeah, it takes money to eat healthy and it takes time when people are barely

671
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,640
getting by. Also, keep in mind, this stuff is, if you had a rough day, who isn't happy after like

672
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:18,000
a box of cheezus, you know, right? And well, there's, there's a place for that, right? And,

673
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,280
you know, the, there's a lot of concern that this sort of argument leads to a continual

674
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,800
shaming of people eating, you know, processed foods, et cetera. There's a place for processed

675
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,400
foods in the world, but there is also something clearly very wrong with our food system that is

676
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:41,200
like hurting people and that is doing something bad to their health. And you think it's, this is

677
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,960
what it, this is the culprit. Oh, 100%. I mean, the, the farm bill is a reflection of moral values

678
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,960
and our farm bill is now designed for Wall Street. It's designed for PepsiCo to make chips and

679
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,880
pop as cheap as possible at the expense of everything else. So as chips got cheaper,

680
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,160
you know, fresh stuff, stuff got more expensive. And yeah, it's, I mean, also these supply chain

681
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,400
lines, you know, it's even in like a lot of vegetables used to be grown in Iowa and that's

682
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,640
gone. Um, and also when things, my husband and I were just talking about carrots today,

683
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:14,320
how awful baby carrots taste. So like private equity is one of the largest grower carrots in

684
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,200
America. Yeah. I mean, it's really funny. I've had conversations with people before, because,

685
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,040
you know, I'm the kind of guy, I just look stuff up when I'm interacting with it. And I like looked

686
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,600
up baby carrots once and you probably know better than me. But the story that I read was that one

687
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,400
enterprising carrot company figured out, well, if we take the ugly carrots and we whittle them down

688
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,200
into little carrot nubs, then, you know, that's like reproducible. The carrot doesn't need to

689
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,800
be pretty, right? We can do that with any carrot. And then we can take the shavings and we can,

690
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,360
you know, turn it into sugar and use it as an additive in things. And when I try to tell people

691
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,240
this, I'm like, baby carrots are like whittled carrots. Like people will say to me in my life,

692
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,280
they'll go, no, they're, they're baby carrots. They're like little, they're like, the carrot is

693
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,920
a baby. They picked it while it was still a little child. I'm eating a carrot toddler. No,

694
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,120
motherfucker, it's a whittled carrot. Somebody put that on a lathe, you know, and it turned it real

695
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:10,400
fast to like shrink the carrot down. You're eating a mass produced like carrot chunk.

696
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,960
I'm embarrassed to say, Adam, I thought that until very recently.

697
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:19,200
They don't even look like baby carrots. They look like a piece of carpentry. They look like

698
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,280
something you'd use to join two, two by force. I just didn't think we'd be that wasteful. I mean,

699
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,280
that's why I just couldn't believe we would shave down a carrot. And then, but here's the thing,

700
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,840
it makes a bad product. And so like, you turn away from it. You're like, like,

701
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,240
melons is the other one I notice about. You got to put so much hummus on a baby carrot for it to

702
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,920
taste like anything. It's like the saddest experience to eat a baby carrot.

703
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,520
Yes. And so like it pushes, you're like, oh, produce isn't that good anymore, or

704
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,920
these Driscoll berries don't taste that good. So then you start eating more,

705
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,120
well, who isn't, you know, Oreos and stuff. And then on top of it, you go into these grocery stores

706
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,200
and like, you're not seeing innovation. You're not seeing new products because like these stores,

707
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,120
they don't want to deal with some local person doing what you only do two stores at Walmart.

708
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,720
They want to deal in the bisco that can do 4,000 stores. So that's why when you go into a store

709
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,080
now, you just see a new kind of Oreo. You don't see new products. You don't see quality stuff.

710
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:13,520
And it's, on top of it, it's, it skews the system so much where, I mean, so much of that

711
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,760
neoliberal framework of like, change the system with your fork to bifurcate the system even more.

712
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,360
You have like, whatever that fancy LA one's called Aragon for like the rich.

713
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:27,520
Arawan, yeah. Arawan. And then you have like, Walmart is massive. Walmart sells one in three

714
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,920
groceries. Their market share grocery is the same as the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh,

715
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,280
and eighth combined. That is an insane amount of market power.

716
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,640
And as you say, one baron creates more barons because Walmart wants all the food. They want to

717
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,920
buy it in huge tranches. They want to get all their food from one supplier. And so that privileges

718
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,120
the one supplier who's able to grow the exact same thing in huge quantities to sell to every

719
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:56,320
Walmart store simultaneously. And that causes them to buy each other up. Or for one, like if

720
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,440
Walmart's selling one out of three groceries, then pretty soon you're going to have one person

721
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,600
selling one out of three berries and then probably even more than that. You said melons,

722
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,240
though. What's the problem with melons? I wanted to hear it.

723
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,080
I mean, after spending all this time, I mean, feel sorry for my husband because I just vomit

724
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,760
this information I had on all day. And so we got married two years ago.

725
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,680
I'll replace them. I'll marry you. I love hearing this stuff. He doesn't want to hear it anymore.

726
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,240
Okay. Propose. I'm down.

727
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,160
Our one year anniversary, we went to like, like France and Italy. And I'm just,

728
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:29,200
I got to see a food system that worked. And I hate cantaloupe. I just, I see it in the fruit

729
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,720
bowl. I think it tastes awful. But then like, they had it over there and you're like, wait,

730
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,760
this is actually really good. They would sell it on the side of the road. You pull over,

731
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,720
you buy a good cantaloupe and you're like, it's just, it's kind of like when you cut corners

732
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,640
so much, at some point you're cutting bone. Like there's no efficiencies again. You're

733
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,040
cutting quality and it's just so rapid, especially private equity people don't,

734
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,200
they don't understand how to run a business. I mean, the reason the best grocery stores in

735
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,760
America are actually still privately owned, like HGB in Texas, Hive in Iowa, Wegmans on the East

736
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,920
Coast. You know what I mean? There's not this Wall Street financialization because like,

737
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,160
some boy who went to Harvard MBA, who's never worked a grocery store job in his life,

738
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,440
doesn't understand the nuances of this, of these marketplaces. And it's also, it's a profession.

739
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,760
There's a craftsmanship to merchandising. My dad used to be a beer merchandiser. So like,

740
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,600
I noticed that when I go into like, you go into like a Wegmans or whatever, fancy growth, like,

741
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,640
sorry, those type of grocery stores, they merchandise, they care, they're,

742
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,000
it's homecoming weekend. It's gonna be a bunch of homecoming stuff. You go into Walmart and

743
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,400
they just throw the pallet on the shelf and you have to dig for it. Yep. Well, what can,

744
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,120
what can be done about this, right? You had said that maybe there's a positive sign in Lena Kahn's

745
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:39,360
leadership at the FTC. We'll see how long she's there based on what's happening, what's going

746
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:44,640
to happen in November. I kind of don't think Trump will keep her on if he wins. But you know,

747
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:51,040
we have seen a sea change in antitrust enforcement, at least on the Democratic side.

748
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:56,480
And there are occasionally some Republicans who will join in on an antitrust fight here or there.

749
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,720
They do occasionally have an ally. And you're saying that, you know, the right, right side

750
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:07,040
of the aisle is becoming more and more obsessed with food. So is there a growing appetite for

751
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:12,240
change in our food system? Yeah, I mean, I think what Lena is really fascinating is,

752
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,760
I actually think she's one of President Biden's best of local points, because

753
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,200
what says so much was earlier this year, Matt Gaetz went to the Wall Street Journal and praised her.

754
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,560
Wow. That is, they're such a, I'm a big fan of outflanking, like Republicans will talk this

755
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:31,120
big game about me backing, be right there with them. Josh Hawley does a lot of this,

756
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,720
outflank Republicans here, because it's such a, hold their feet to the fire. I mean,

757
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,720
it's also kind of, I'm a big believer too that weird things happen in America when

758
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,640
unique coalitions come together. But what gives me the big most hope and what we can do are like

759
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,360
three things that come to my mind. One is the death of ethanol. The Biden administration has

760
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,360
been incredibly aggressive at transitioning America out of flake to EVs and hybrids. And

761
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,360
people don't realize, but the largest use of corn now in America is ethanol. And it's really,

762
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:03,600
which is used for what? Burning, burning corn in your cars. Like it's truly. Wow. It is the Museum

763
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,480
of Failure included ethanol and it's an exhibit. I, anyone that thinks ethanol is good for the

764
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,680
climate thinks the world is flat in 2024. Also, I think in food, you see one of President Biden's

765
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,000
worst political appointments, Secretary Vilsack. Secretary Vilsack of USDA is a former industrial

766
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,400
dairy lobbyist. His solution to climate change right now is to put ethanol in the airplanes.

767
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:28,480
Wow. And by the way, this is a crazy thing to do because like fossil fuels are bad enough

768
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,560
because you're taking energy out of the ground, putting it into the atmosphere, right? Stored

769
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:37,920
energy out of the ground into the atmosphere. That's bad. That warms the earth de facto, right?

770
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:43,200
But if you're taking energy from the sun and putting it into the atmosphere, right? Like the

771
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,600
sun is hitting the corn, making the corn grow. And then you're burning that. You're releasing,

772
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,040
that's a whole new source of energy to put into the atmosphere to heat the planet up.

773
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,680
It's even worse because you have to use fossil fuels to help grow the corn.

774
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,000
Right. Of course you do. Fertilizer and et cetera. Yeah.

775
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,760
And the other appreciated thing is Koch brothers are actually massive in fertilizer. They have

776
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,320
a massive holding in nitrogen fertilizer. So like there's this whole weird marriage between

777
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,560
big egg and big fossil fuel oil that hasn't been fully, I don't think people realize.

778
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:12,320
But it's just delusional. But you know what? It's like watching Miley Coady chase that

779
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,640
bird off the cliff right now. Ethanol is going to die. I don't care what the industry says.

780
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:21,840
It's going to meet its maker. And my big moment, to me, it's what are we going to do at that moment?

781
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,800
I want to put animals back on land. That is like truly one of my biggest things because it's like,

782
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,360
it takes the temperature down. It makes, who doesn't want more farmers? Here's like,

783
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:35,040
most grain production is going to be robotics. That's not a bad thing. You go to a farm show

784
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:40,080
now. These tractors drive themselves. But there's only so many dairy cow one man or one person could

785
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:46,720
look after. But for these rural areas, it's more jobs. Yeah. So you want to go to a small scale

786
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:54,960
version of dairy farming again, like breaking it up. And rather than one farmer, one quote farmer

787
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,960
owning huge numbers of cows, you've got small scale farms again. You think that's a massive

788
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:04,080
improvement? I just want to go back to that family farmer model. It's also what it does too.

789
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,200
Theory is weird where actually this industrial dairy model is actually even worse for the climate

790
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:14,800
because when a cow is on pasture, when she defecates, she's fertilizing her feet.

791
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,840
When you put them indoors, first of all, you have to use fossil fuels to grow her feet.

792
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:22,800
But when you pull her manure, when it breaks down, it creates additional methane that is not

793
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:28,320
produced when she defecates on land. So it creates additional fossil fuel gas. So like that bakers

794
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:32,960
field dairy production model is actually incredibly more destructive for the environment than

795
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,840
some dairy cow in Wisconsin. So like Bill Sack comes out of that world. So that's why

796
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,600
he has this like bullshit kind of mentality there. But do you think there is an emerging politics

797
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:50,480
that is more populist food politics where we can sort of go across partisan lines?

798
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:59,360
Because if you're looking for rural America is largely red and Republican politicians tend to

799
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,880
have pro-corporate policies. So do Democrats, but these are trends we're talking about.

800
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,720
It does seem like this is an issue that could break some of our political logjam if you have

801
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:15,440
politicians from rural areas say, no, actually, I want to fight for the chicken farmer,

802
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,280
the hog farmer, the small scale pork farmer like these and actually help their folks.

803
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,120
Oh, totally. I mean, keep in mind, I also want to broaden the conversation because it's not just

804
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,640
about the farmer. It's about those who pick it, process it, transport it, cook it, serve it.

805
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:34,160
Of course. People like my mom and dad, that's one in 10 of Americans. And we're obsessed with such

806
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:38,560
a small part of the pie. And once you talk about one in 10, you center that on labor,

807
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:44,240
that's what really matters. And the dirty secret of big ag is it hollowed out its voter base.

808
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,080
You used to have thousands of Iowa hog farms and now you just have a few of our

809
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,840
barons and no one's called bluff on it. Denver has no clothes now and no one's called it.

810
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,600
And that's also my big thing now is I think we should junk the farm bill.

811
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:00,320
The farm bill picks favorites. It heavily subsidizes grains. It's destructive for the climate.

812
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:07,920
It rewards its incentive, this destructive model. On top of it, you have the whole heritage

813
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:13,600
heritage, Kato Institute. They hate that model too. They hate the farm bill.

814
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:18,000
And I think that's a, to me, there's no reason why Democrats should support the modern-day farm

815
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,320
bill. The best example of how rotten the farm bill has gotten is actually crop insurance.

816
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,920
Because when people hear crop insurance, they think it's for a hurricane or rain or whatever.

817
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,920
It's not. It's insurance for low prices where 60% of the premium is paid for by the taxpayer.

818
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,200
And there's no cap at them. So people don't realize Bill Gates has won the largest owner

819
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,440
of farmland in America. If you want to talk about another baron. So he can get as much crop

820
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:47,440
insurance as he wants, as much corn as he wants. And so, you know what I mean? It's so,

821
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,880
I just, I've been telling reformers, don't play, like, the system is so broken. Why

822
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:59,040
back that? Like let's move away from the system. At the same time, use school meals as like the

823
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:04,560
positive structural change vehicle. Who doesn't want all dairy-served Wisconsin come from, you

824
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:08,400
know, pasture family dairy farms instead of like industrial beef in the Brazilian rainforest.

825
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,320
Like it's good politics. It's good tasting. You keep your money local and you're building up a new

826
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,560
system as you phase out an old one. Because I mean, school food's a joke. We all know that.

827
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:22,320
Yeah. But the problem is the farm bill is one of those bills that, you know, no matter how divided

828
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:28,800
Congress is, it flies through every time because it has so many parts of the society are dependent

829
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,800
on it, right? Like it's got something for everybody or it's got something for the voters

830
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,960
in or the constituents or the money constituents in every area, you know. It gives

831
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,920
subsidies to the cities to purchase food, gives subsidies to the, you know, to the barons in the

832
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:50,000
red areas to grow the food. Is there really a chance that it could be, you know, junked, as you say?

833
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,320
I mean, it's actually kind of falling apart. I mean, they couldn't pass. They tried to do

834
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:58,320
basically a copy-paste bill and they had to punt it. So like the rumor on the street is going to try.

835
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,520
Okay. No, no.

836
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,080
Then I'm not up on what's happened. That's amazing.

837
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:06,080
No, but it's part, but it's this weird thing where, so even Republicans find crop insurance

838
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,680
too gluttonous. Like they want more crop insurance. You're right though. I mean,

839
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:15,360
there's this weird coalition of like, it's food stamps in the farm entitlement programs.

840
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:19,520
I'll be frank. I think you can break those apart. Food stamps are going to be okay because

841
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,800
Walmart depends on food stamps. Walmart is the richest family in America. Some days it's the

842
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,440
richest family in the world. So much of their employee and customer base depends on food stamps.

843
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:34,240
It's a waste subsidy. So much of corporate America needs that. I'm feeling comfortable.

844
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,400
No one's going to touch that. I mean, first of all, you just need all Democrats and 10 Republicans

845
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:44,640
to save that. You take away the crop insurance. You do Farm Bill standalone. Half Republicans

846
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:49,200
will flake on that. And if Democrats don't support it, these, these, my hog baron, you know what I

847
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,800
mean? Like they don't have a constituency. Yeah. They're massive amount of welfare they get. It's

848
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,760
just also that coalition was formed in 1960s America. The suburbs were not a part of that

849
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,680
coalition. Right. Like rural America's, there's something. The suburbs. I left the suburbs out

850
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:06,800
of the story. And I mean, this election will come down to a few suburbs in the Midwest states.

851
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:13,360
Yeah. What can the public do about this if there isn't sense about this as I am to take us out?

852
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:18,080
The big thing is I always tell people, buy what you can, buy your values, whatever. But the other

853
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:22,240
thing too is help connect your farmers doing it right with your schools, with your colleges.

854
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,320
Those procurement contracts really stabilize them. Like a lot of farmers will tell you privately,

855
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:30,000
they don't like doing the farmers market. They get rained out, whatever. It's not consistent.

856
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,760
You get that contract with the UC school system, your local school. It's just such a good

857
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,080
stabilizer. And you want to build up the people doing it right. Because writing this book over

858
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:41,920
five years is, yes, I focus on a few bad people, but most people are good. They're trying to do

859
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,480
the right thing. They're just struggling. And so how do you rep? How do you copy and paste them

860
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,280
and help them, you know, not decay, but like actually grow and, and because it's also,

861
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,160
there's no positive vision here. That's why I realized writing this book. No, no,

862
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,040
neither party is articulating that positive vision, especially for rural America.

863
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,320
And I actually think people crave a positiveness. Like they want the opposite of what they have

864
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,560
right now. And the positiveness is inspiring. You're like, okay, it gives people that power

865
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:09,200
to rush the gates to get to that better system. Like that's what gives me hope, I should say.

866
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,840
Yeah. And it sort of seems like all we need is a politician to, or a leader to really run on that

867
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:20,080
stuff, you know, and to say, you know, to find the way that this affects everybody and to speak

868
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,920
to people who haven't been spoken to. It literally is a pinata saying, hit me, hit me. I mean, look,

869
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,720
the meat packing, especially breaking up the meat companies, like these aren't,

870
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,360
these are comically corrupt companies. By the way, they're not even American.

871
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,000
They're like these weird state-backed monopolies. Yeah.

872
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,200
Smithfield's quasi, there's this weird Chinese relationship there.

873
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:41,600
A lot of the beef companies are Brazilian. So it's like, there's good politics there. It's just

874
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,120
something that you're waiting for the right person, vocal courage to take a swing of that

875
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,520
pinata. On God willing, somebody will. And I can't thank you enough for coming on here to make

876
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,600
the case that somebody should. You've certainly convinced me. The name of the book is Barons.
