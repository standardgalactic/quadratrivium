00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
Hello and welcome to Factually, I'm Adam Conover.

00:02.600 --> 00:04.600
Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.800
You know, you may have noticed that I spend a lot of time

00:06.800 --> 00:09.000
talking shit about the wealthy on this show,

00:09.000 --> 00:10.320
how they hoard their wealth,

00:10.320 --> 00:12.120
go to war against their own workers,

00:12.120 --> 00:14.560
and are in the process of destroying the planet

00:14.560 --> 00:16.980
all to protect their precious golden treasure.

00:16.980 --> 00:19.400
And I think a lot of you might feel the same way.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.200
That might be why you watch this show and you're not alone.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.440
The American economy has gotten more and more unfair

00:26.440 --> 00:29.520
and frankly fucked up over the past 50 years

00:29.520 --> 00:32.000
and people have taken notice.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.640
You don't need to be an economist

00:33.640 --> 00:34.960
to know that there's something bad

00:34.960 --> 00:38.680
about the top 10% of a society hoarding 2 thirds of its wealth

00:38.680 --> 00:41.640
or about a country where wages since 1979

00:41.640 --> 00:45.000
have grown over five times faster for the top 1%

00:45.000 --> 00:47.220
than for the bottom 90%.

00:47.220 --> 00:49.220
As a result, in recent years,

00:49.220 --> 00:52.120
we have seen left-leaning social movements coalesce

00:52.120 --> 00:53.960
in order to fight this injustice.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.200
First, during the Occupy Wall Street movement,

00:56.200 --> 00:59.080
then in the 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders

00:59.080 --> 01:00.960
and more recently in the emergence of groups

01:00.960 --> 01:03.280
like the Democratic Socialists of America,

01:03.280 --> 01:05.520
the word socialism is now a part

01:05.520 --> 01:08.160
of our political conversation in a way it simply wasn't

01:08.160 --> 01:11.680
in 2008 or 2000 or 1992.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.040
But while that's true,

01:13.040 --> 01:16.200
it still hasn't fully entered our political mainstream.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.280
You haven't seen a lot of socialist senators

01:18.280 --> 01:20.660
or even many members of the house yet.

01:20.660 --> 01:22.240
And here's the really weird part.

01:22.240 --> 01:26.400
The same is not true for the far right of our politics.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.000
I mean, the current GOP presidential candidate

01:29.000 --> 01:31.880
is open about wanting to cut the modest social safety net

01:31.880 --> 01:34.720
we do have, reducing social security and Medicare,

01:34.720 --> 01:36.840
lowering taxes on the rich incorporations

01:36.840 --> 01:38.980
and gutting environmental regulations,

01:38.980 --> 01:41.280
all while enacting a wildly regressive,

01:41.280 --> 01:43.360
frankly fascist social agenda

01:43.360 --> 01:44.920
that will reduce the rights for women

01:44.920 --> 01:46.940
and target immigrants for deportation.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.720
I mean, I will grant that Bernie Sanders

01:48.720 --> 01:50.440
is very popular for a socialist

01:50.440 --> 01:52.160
in the context of American history,

01:52.160 --> 01:54.600
but there simply isn't a Bernie army

01:54.600 --> 01:57.000
the same way there is a MAGA army.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.640
There are a hundred times as many elected MAGA leaders

01:59.640 --> 02:02.040
as socialists in American government today.

02:02.040 --> 02:05.840
Despite all of the left successes, why is that?

02:05.840 --> 02:07.320
Well, to answer that question,

02:07.320 --> 02:09.280
we have an incredible guest on the show today.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.240
Before we get into it though,

And now let's introduce today's guest.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.120
Bhaskar Sankara is president of the nation magazine,

02:39.120 --> 02:40.880
the founding editor of Jacobin,

02:40.880 --> 02:43.620
and the author of a book called The Socialist Manifesto,

02:43.620 --> 02:45.240
the case for radical politics

02:45.240 --> 02:47.440
and an era of extreme inequality.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.280
Please welcome Bhaskar Sankara.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.240
Bhaskar, thank you so much for being on the show.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.160
Thanks for having me.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.480
I feel like it's long overdue

02:56.480 --> 02:58.800
because a lot of the issues that you write about

02:58.800 --> 03:00.400
in your work and that you cover

03:00.400 --> 03:03.000
are issues we've discussed on this show.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.440
And you identify as a socialist and a leftist.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.720
I think that it's a really interesting time

03:08.720 --> 03:11.360
for those ideas in America because on the one hand,

03:11.360 --> 03:15.600
you see them spreading or becoming more popular

03:15.600 --> 03:17.920
in the public to some degree,

03:17.920 --> 03:22.200
in the policy apparatus to some degree.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.360
And yet the number of people,

03:24.360 --> 03:25.560
I saw a Pew research study,

03:25.600 --> 03:28.600
a number of people who have positive views

03:28.600 --> 03:30.840
of socialism is going down and is much lower

03:30.840 --> 03:33.400
than people have positive views of capitalism.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.160
Take those broad surveys for what they are,

03:37.000 --> 03:40.480
but it's sort of like, is this growing or is it not?

03:40.480 --> 03:43.640
How do you feel about the overall prospects

03:43.640 --> 03:47.200
for leftist politics and these policies

03:47.200 --> 03:48.720
in America right now?

03:48.720 --> 03:49.840
Well, I think 10 years ago,

03:49.840 --> 03:53.000
you could say socialism in America as a current,

03:53.000 --> 03:54.720
even as an opposition movement,

03:54.720 --> 03:56.360
was basically dead.

03:56.360 --> 03:59.280
And now you could say it's on life support.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.360
It depends on your perspective.

04:01.360 --> 04:02.880
I was like, oh, she's doing good.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.400
She's only in a coma now.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.080
So we'll see what happens in a couple of years.

04:07.080 --> 04:07.920
Yeah.

04:07.920 --> 04:08.760
Exactly.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.000
So I think that for me, it feels fantastic.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.840
I became a card-carrying member

04:14.840 --> 04:16.560
of the Democratic Socialist of America.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.640
Not actually card-carrying

04:17.640 --> 04:19.320
because there were two dysfunctional

04:19.320 --> 04:21.640
to actually get me a card at the time.

04:21.680 --> 04:25.960
In April 2007, there was about 5,000 of us

04:25.960 --> 04:28.760
and I was among the youngest members.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.480
I joined right before my 18th birthday.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.080
And today there's around 100,000 members of DSA,

04:36.080 --> 04:38.520
the Democratic Socialist of America.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.280
Jacobin, the Socialist magazine I founded,

04:41.280 --> 04:46.120
has around 66,000 or so subscribers.

04:46.120 --> 04:50.720
There is a base and obviously between having Bernie Sanders

04:50.720 --> 04:53.440
as a self-identified Democratic Socialist,

04:53.440 --> 04:55.960
politicians like Alexander Kasiroportez,

04:55.960 --> 04:59.040
there is a small amount

04:59.040 --> 05:04.040
of highly visible Democratic Socialists in public life.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.360
And that's not something we had in the recent past

05:08.360 --> 05:12.000
in the US and in that sense, it's doing great.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.600
Now, is it ready to storm the barricades

05:14.600 --> 05:17.040
and really change American society

05:17.040 --> 05:18.520
in a fundamental way?

05:18.520 --> 05:21.480
Maybe not, but for a opposition movement

05:21.480 --> 05:26.280
that's just getting its legs, I'm not too disappointed.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.080
Well, let's talk about Bernie Sanders

05:28.080 --> 05:32.480
because when his first few campaigns,

05:33.480 --> 05:37.000
they grew to such size, they ended up powering a movement.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.080
The movement continued in many ways,

05:39.080 --> 05:43.120
which resulted in the growth of the DSA.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.120
But if you contrast that with Donald Trump's movement,

05:46.120 --> 05:48.600
and I don't wanna create an equivalency there,

05:48.600 --> 05:50.600
but there are some similarities,

05:52.320 --> 05:55.640
his movement has taken over an entire party

05:55.640 --> 05:59.520
and has the Democratic Socialist movement,

05:59.520 --> 06:01.360
you can say, oh, there's a mayor over here,

06:01.360 --> 06:03.040
there's some state legislatures over there,

06:03.040 --> 06:06.560
you've got here in LA, we have, I believe,

06:06.560 --> 06:09.080
three city council people out of 15

06:09.080 --> 06:12.400
who are members or at least associated with the DSA.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.880
Hey, yeah, those are successes for the movement,

06:16.880 --> 06:20.600
but the MAGA movement has representatives,

06:20.600 --> 06:22.440
senators, governors, et cetera,

06:22.440 --> 06:24.800
and hey, they don't win every election yada yada,

06:24.800 --> 06:28.320
but in terms of the way that it has been injected

06:28.320 --> 06:32.040
into the mainstream of American politics

06:32.040 --> 06:37.040
in this stunningly swift way is kind of in sharp contrast

06:37.040 --> 06:39.800
to what happened to the Bernie Sanders movement

06:39.800 --> 06:40.840
or the relative success.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.120
So what do you credit that to,

06:44.120 --> 06:46.240
or do you think that the comparison I'm drawing

06:46.240 --> 06:48.640
is false entirely, which you may?

06:48.640 --> 06:50.400
Well, I think that it's always easier

06:50.400 --> 06:55.040
to organize big money and you get some organic backing

06:55.040 --> 06:59.240
from ordinary people in the interests of capital.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.880
So fundamentally, Donald Trump's appeal was,

07:01.880 --> 07:04.760
I'm a businessman, I know what I have, make deals,

07:04.760 --> 07:06.320
I'm gonna cut a better deal for you,

07:06.320 --> 07:09.000
ordinary American, and also for American business

07:09.000 --> 07:10.160
in the world.

07:10.160 --> 07:14.200
And I think that's an easier appeal to make than,

07:14.200 --> 07:17.280
my name is Bernie Sanders, I'm an outsider,

07:17.280 --> 07:19.680
I wanna take on millionaires and billionaires,

07:19.680 --> 07:22.760
can you loan me $27?

07:22.760 --> 07:26.680
And I promise I'll spend your money well, fly economy,

07:26.680 --> 07:29.840
and travel around the country, getting my message out.

07:29.840 --> 07:34.480
And I think that the Sanders route was a lot tougher.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.520
Trump was tapping into, I think,

07:37.520 --> 07:39.880
a continuum of Republican politics.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.240
We don't even think of it that way,

07:41.240 --> 07:45.360
but the Tea Party to Trump, I think had common threads.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.680
And the hysteria that Trump whipped up

07:47.680 --> 07:50.200
around Obama's birth certificate was kind of part

07:50.200 --> 07:52.680
of tapping into that old Tea Party base,

07:52.680 --> 07:54.400
but radicalizing it.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.280
Then he was able to, with his own gifts as an orator,

07:58.280 --> 07:59.880
he might not appeal to everyone,

07:59.880 --> 08:03.000
but he obviously is a skilled communicator

08:03.000 --> 08:06.200
in a certain way, and an entertainer, you know?

08:06.200 --> 08:08.200
I mean, the guy will riff for three hours

08:08.200 --> 08:10.640
and get a stretch about everybody he hates,

08:10.640 --> 08:13.120
and that's, you know, just as a stand-up comic,

08:13.120 --> 08:15.680
like that's impressive, and the guy gets laughs, you know?

08:15.680 --> 08:19.840
It is a feat of oration, what he does.

08:19.840 --> 08:23.080
And he has a cadence, he has, just as a performer,

08:23.080 --> 08:26.280
I think he has his skills, you know?

08:26.280 --> 08:28.960
Bernie always seems like he's a bit tired and fed up,

08:28.960 --> 08:31.760
which he is at this point, he has every right to be,

08:31.760 --> 08:35.080
but Trump was able to combine his natural gifts,

08:35.080 --> 08:37.240
the space that he had cultivated,

08:37.240 --> 08:40.320
and radicalized a bit with the Obama birthday stuff,

08:40.320 --> 08:42.320
with a lot of his own money,

08:42.320 --> 08:45.960
and a very hollowed-out Republican party

08:45.960 --> 08:49.320
that he just knew how to pick apart.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.960
And by the time they realized that it was too late

08:51.960 --> 08:54.920
to, they needed to stop him, it was too late,

08:54.920 --> 08:58.360
whereas the DNC realized they had to stop Bernie,

08:58.360 --> 09:00.560
but it wasn't too late, you know?

09:00.560 --> 09:02.560
That Obama was able to make a few calls,

09:02.560 --> 09:05.160
and Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris,

09:05.160 --> 09:07.720
and others were able to, from their perspective,

09:07.720 --> 09:10.720
did the smart thing, rally behind Joe Biden,

09:10.720 --> 09:12.200
Joe Biden winning the election.

09:12.200 --> 09:16.520
So on their own terms, they made a good decision,

09:16.520 --> 09:18.760
but they were unable to stop Trump.

09:18.760 --> 09:23.760
But I do think that maybe a stronger comparison

09:24.800 --> 09:27.160
to Trump would be, and I say this to someone

09:27.160 --> 09:29.520
who's generally a supporter of a lot of his policies,

09:29.520 --> 09:31.320
would be someone like Amalon, Mexico,

09:31.320 --> 09:34.720
who's been able to combine some of his oratory and charisma,

09:34.720 --> 09:37.560
and somewhat strongman personality,

09:37.560 --> 09:41.880
but combine it with a genuinely progressive agenda.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.920
I think Bernie was always, in the United States,

09:43.920 --> 09:46.160
doing something a little bit different

09:46.160 --> 09:48.960
and a more difficult task, given our context.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.360
Mm, and draw that comparison a little bit more

09:52.360 --> 09:56.080
between Amalon who, in Mexico,

09:56.080 --> 09:57.680
and what Bernie did that's more difficult.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.240
Just pull that out some more.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.480
Yeah, I think that, first of all,

10:01.480 --> 10:05.200
Amal was someone who ran multiple times for president.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.600
He arguably won in 2006.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.040
He had the election, again, some people say,

10:10.040 --> 10:12.000
stolen from him then, but either way,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.200
he was a very well-known national figure.

10:15.600 --> 10:20.280
He is someone who came from a lot of the historical networks

10:20.280 --> 10:22.080
that they left, but he figured out

10:22.080 --> 10:25.320
that he had to leave and abandon some of those networks

10:25.320 --> 10:27.640
and ways of talking and try to articulate

10:27.640 --> 10:30.120
a more populist framework

10:30.120 --> 10:33.760
for explaining who he was to the Mexican people

10:33.760 --> 10:36.920
and what his appeal was about.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.280
It was not just the regular left-wing appeals

10:40.280 --> 10:43.320
about redistribution and taking on the wealthy,

10:43.320 --> 10:47.560
but he combined it with this idea of fighting corruption

10:47.560 --> 10:50.360
and fighting to preserve the sanctity and purity

10:50.360 --> 10:52.200
of Mexican republicanism

10:52.200 --> 10:55.160
in a national, popular sense.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.440
Bernie Sanders, in the same way,

10:57.440 --> 11:00.800
came from the hard left, really, in the United States.

11:00.800 --> 11:04.360
He was a member of the Young People's Socials League,

11:04.360 --> 11:06.680
which just sounds incredibly anachronistic,

11:06.680 --> 11:08.560
as if anyone, all the people I know

11:08.560 --> 11:11.040
who are members of the Young People's Socials League

11:11.040 --> 11:13.200
are, like, 85 years old.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.600
Right, they're not young anymore.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.560
At the reunions, they're all on walkers, yeah.

11:18.560 --> 11:22.720
He joined in the left,

11:22.720 --> 11:24.200
there was before the new left, really.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.520
Like, he was interested in this

11:25.520 --> 11:27.800
when he was at Brooklyn College

11:27.800 --> 11:29.840
and later on at the University of Chicago.

11:29.840 --> 11:32.480
So we're talking about pretty early on in the 1960s.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.800
I actually know a guy,

11:34.880 --> 11:38.880
I'm not sure if he wants me to cite him,

11:38.880 --> 11:41.240
but he's like,

11:41.240 --> 11:43.440
he loves to tell me stories about this period

11:43.440 --> 11:45.920
because he was a leftist in the late 50s and the 60s.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.920
And often, you can't really trust all of his stories

11:48.920 --> 11:50.200
that he once told me.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.200
So then I told the Black Panther Party,

11:53.200 --> 11:56.080
your slogan shouldn't be free Huey Newton,

11:56.080 --> 11:57.800
it should just be free Huey.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.640
But...

12:02.120 --> 12:04.400
So take this with a grain of salt,

12:04.400 --> 12:06.000
but you can tell me,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.480
he recruited Bernie Sanders

12:07.480 --> 12:10.400
to not just the Young People's Socials League.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.160
And that, I think, is the established fact

12:12.160 --> 12:14.400
that he did that in the University of Chicago.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.440
But he recruited him to the,

12:18.440 --> 12:23.440
the Shackmanite kind of Trotsky-oriented fraction

12:24.240 --> 12:26.920
of the Young People's Socials League

12:26.920 --> 12:29.040
in the early 1960s.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.000
So Bernie was very steeply entrenched in the left.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.480
I mean, Bernie, I used to do a joke on stage

12:35.480 --> 12:37.480
about how Bernie came to LA

12:37.480 --> 12:40.240
when he was running the second time.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.720
And he gave a speech about,

12:42.720 --> 12:44.560
you should all be so proud,

12:44.560 --> 12:45.600
you have the dodges,

12:45.600 --> 12:48.400
because we were all so sad in Brooklyn

12:48.400 --> 12:50.440
when the dodges moved to LA.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.520
And I was like, wow,

12:51.520 --> 12:54.480
that's the moment I realized he was too old to be president.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.000
Like you can't go around telling people

12:57.000 --> 12:59.480
that you remember when the Dodgers left Brooklyn.

12:59.480 --> 13:02.800
Like that is the oldest school thing possible.

13:02.800 --> 13:06.760
That's like history books have been written about this.

13:06.760 --> 13:11.440
So he's steeped in that sort of like mid-century America

13:11.440 --> 13:13.200
in this very specific way.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.080
Yeah, and exactly, I think that was part of his strength

13:15.160 --> 13:18.640
because he both left behind that existing laughter.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.240
He moved to Vermont in a place that he could,

13:21.240 --> 13:25.040
he could really find a way to influence politics

13:25.040 --> 13:26.960
at a bigger, bigger scale.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.960
But he kept a lot of its allegiance

13:28.960 --> 13:31.280
to the old bread and butter,

13:31.280 --> 13:32.880
simple way of talking about things.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.840
And often when people say that,

13:34.840 --> 13:36.320
that could be a euphemism for,

13:36.320 --> 13:38.040
let's not talk about gay people.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.760
Let's not talk about racial justice and so on.

13:40.760 --> 13:44.280
But Bernie Sanders is a product of the new left.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.880
He's a product of the civil rights movement.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.120
He's someone who went to Vermont to try to farm,

13:49.120 --> 13:51.760
which is kind of just a crazy thought in and of itself

13:51.760 --> 13:53.160
that kind of back to the land movement.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.880
You would think they would maybe pick somewhere

13:54.880 --> 13:58.240
a little bit more fertile than in his book.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.320
I always wondered how he got to Vermont from Brooklyn.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.080
He literally, it was part of like the back to the land,

14:03.080 --> 14:04.600
like let's start a little homestead

14:04.600 --> 14:06.320
in New England hippie movement.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.920
I'm not sure if he intended to like survive by farming,

14:08.920 --> 14:10.520
but it was definitely let's get a cabin,

14:10.520 --> 14:12.160
let's get a little land.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.000
Wow.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.200
The same book where he talks kind of about,

14:16.200 --> 14:18.640
the New York trolley dodgers or whatever,

14:18.640 --> 14:21.160
the Brooklyn trolley dodgers leave in town

14:21.160 --> 14:23.840
and him getting upset.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.640
He also talks about surviving that first winter,

14:27.640 --> 14:32.640
which was one of the worst winters in modern history

14:33.080 --> 14:34.480
in terms of temperature and whatnot

14:34.480 --> 14:38.440
and not having proper heat and trying to find enough

14:38.440 --> 14:42.160
to burn, to stay warm.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.520
He obviously has a little bit of that hippie-gippy

14:46.520 --> 14:50.360
left in him, but he had a very simple message

14:50.360 --> 14:52.760
and he said the same thing in his first run

14:52.760 --> 14:55.240
in the early 1970s for office,

14:55.240 --> 14:57.480
all the way up to his 2016 run,

14:57.480 --> 15:00.520
which was millionaires control too much

15:00.520 --> 15:02.480
of this country's wealth.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.880
He would give the same percentage,

15:04.880 --> 15:08.600
X percentage of people control Y percentage of the wealth,

15:08.600 --> 15:10.920
same framing, same syntax.

15:10.920 --> 15:15.600
And in a way, I think the very old,

15:15.600 --> 15:19.200
somewhat mid-century New York ethnic accent

15:19.200 --> 15:21.360
combined with that straight talk,

15:21.360 --> 15:25.240
I think it resonated deeply in a lot of people.

15:25.240 --> 15:30.240
It made somewhat radical ideas seem accessible,

15:30.360 --> 15:31.360
comprehensible.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.840
Yeah, and I made him seem authentic.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.120
This guy's been saying the same thing.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.320
It made it clear that he was authentic, honestly.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.920
That this guy has been saying these same things

15:38.920 --> 15:42.520
for the last 50 years, he comes by it honestly

15:42.520 --> 15:45.360
and we can take him at his word.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.680
But to your point about,

15:46.680 --> 15:48.120
and I don't wanna spend the entire time

15:48.120 --> 15:51.000
relitigating the last couple of elections,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.240
but you're correct that there was a concerted effort

15:53.240 --> 15:55.000
by the Democratic Party to beat him

15:55.000 --> 15:56.800
because Obama and that wing of the party

15:56.800 --> 15:58.600
thought that Bernie couldn't win

15:58.600 --> 16:03.600
and they teamed up to consolidate and beat him.

16:04.320 --> 16:05.840
And I've heard that narrative before

16:05.840 --> 16:07.560
talking to folks in the DSA,

16:07.560 --> 16:08.720
folks who are big Bernie supporters,

16:08.720 --> 16:11.040
ah, Bernie got screwed by the Democratic Party,

16:11.040 --> 16:13.840
but there were also people trying to screw Trump,

16:13.840 --> 16:15.480
maybe not as well.

16:15.480 --> 16:19.200
And you do at some point have to win, right?

16:19.200 --> 16:21.560
Like, Bernie's argument or the argument

16:21.560 --> 16:22.720
of a lot of Bernie supporters were,

16:22.720 --> 16:24.360
well, Bernie would have beaten Trump,

16:25.200 --> 16:28.840
but okay, and would have beaten him the first time as well

16:28.840 --> 16:31.000
in the Hillary Clinton election.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.800
And okay, that's a hypothetical,

16:32.800 --> 16:34.960
but a good piece of support for the hypothetical would be

16:34.960 --> 16:36.080
if he had won the primary.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.560
If you want to prove that your political movement

16:38.560 --> 16:42.520
has the goods, has the juice to sweep the entire country,

16:42.520 --> 16:44.920
then it would be helpful to win the primary first.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.160
And Bernie had a lot of support,

16:47.160 --> 16:50.480
but it's like, hey, was it just that Obama screwed it?

16:50.480 --> 16:53.320
Well, Obama might not have been able to do that

16:53.320 --> 16:56.280
if he had had massively more support than he did

16:56.280 --> 17:01.280
versus, whereas Trump, a thought that I have is,

17:01.480 --> 17:03.080
you said Trump is running on the thing

17:03.080 --> 17:04.520
of being a billionaire, et cetera,

17:04.520 --> 17:07.760
or a very wealthy man who can make business deals,

17:07.760 --> 17:10.360
he was also running on pure hate, right?

17:10.360 --> 17:13.640
Just like powering of there are people out there

17:13.640 --> 17:14.480
who are trying to screw you,

17:14.480 --> 17:15.560
there's people coming over the border,

17:15.560 --> 17:18.200
there's people you hate, I'm gonna take vengeance on them.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.920
And so part of what I wondered is like,

17:20.920 --> 17:24.800
is that not currently in where we are in American politics,

17:24.800 --> 17:26.040
maybe just more powerful?

17:26.040 --> 17:29.560
Is there more support for that than for socialism

17:29.560 --> 17:34.440
and what Bernie and folks like you are asking folks to support?

17:34.440 --> 17:36.600
So I think it's worth keeping in mind,

17:36.600 --> 17:38.880
well, first of all, let's concede.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.000
My view is that Bernie lost the election

17:41.000 --> 17:44.720
and he lost because in 2016, he wasn't recognizable,

17:44.720 --> 17:46.040
he wasn't considered credible

17:46.040 --> 17:48.720
until all of a sudden his message resonated

17:48.720 --> 17:50.420
by then it was almost too late.

17:50.420 --> 17:53.720
So I think if he had started with his momentum

17:53.720 --> 17:55.480
against Clinton earlier,

17:55.480 --> 17:57.560
I think he would have credibly won.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.140
There was nothing the DNC could have done to stop him.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.160
He just got out of the gate a little bit slow

18:04.160 --> 18:07.960
in part because this was always meant

18:07.960 --> 18:09.840
to be something of a protest candidacy.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.920
And I think he was surprised by how seriously he took you.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.240
So he went.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.280
If his 2016 campaign had been his second campaign,

18:17.280 --> 18:19.560
not his first, things might have been different.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.640
Yeah, and I think in his second campaign,

18:21.640 --> 18:24.880
I think by then the democratic field was just broken up

18:24.880 --> 18:26.680
into so many different camps.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.120
And it just happened to be that the Bernie camp

18:29.120 --> 18:32.920
was the largest of these many polarized camps.

18:32.920 --> 18:36.320
But the Democrats had something that Obama,

18:36.320 --> 18:38.400
that the Republicans didn't have,

18:38.400 --> 18:40.680
which is a big unifying figure

18:40.680 --> 18:42.900
that could unite the other camps.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.880
And ultimately it wasn't just a backdoor deal

18:44.880 --> 18:47.200
that Obama cut, it was a deal connected

18:47.200 --> 18:49.200
to various constituencies.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.320
And I think for a lot of let's say black voters,

18:52.320 --> 18:55.040
particularly older black voters in the South

18:55.040 --> 18:58.200
and South Carolina, they voted for Biden

18:58.200 --> 19:02.440
because their primary goal was to find someone

19:02.480 --> 19:04.560
who they thought was electable

19:04.560 --> 19:07.040
and find someone who they thought could be Trump.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.920
And I think the rational kernel of it is

19:09.920 --> 19:12.600
not that Biden's policies would have been better

19:12.600 --> 19:14.800
in a vacuum from Bernie's policies,

19:14.800 --> 19:18.000
but that Biden was electable

19:18.000 --> 19:21.360
and they would bear the brunt of another Trump presidency.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.680
So in that case, it's a bunch of different actors

19:24.680 --> 19:26.480
acting pretty rationally.

19:26.480 --> 19:31.480
And I was a Bernie national surrogate in 2020.

19:31.560 --> 19:36.560
I chalk it up as just losing, losing the game of politics.

19:37.800 --> 19:41.480
And if it was a backroom way for the burning crats to win,

19:41.480 --> 19:44.960
I would have loved to pursue that backroom way.

19:44.960 --> 19:48.120
Yeah, that's politics is making the phone calls,

19:48.120 --> 19:50.840
knowing the people, knowing, hey, this person,

19:50.840 --> 19:52.280
we have to gotta get this person

19:52.280 --> 19:53.720
and their constituency on our side.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.080
Like you can't wish that away.

19:56.080 --> 20:00.080
You have to sort of win that process to some degree.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.640
So I mean, do you think that, sorry, please go on.

20:03.640 --> 20:06.000
No, but as far as your question on,

20:07.040 --> 20:10.400
is there a stronger constituency for hate in the US

20:10.400 --> 20:12.640
or for Trump's sort of vitriolic appeals

20:12.640 --> 20:15.360
and for the Bernie appeals?

20:15.360 --> 20:18.000
I would say that when it comes to redistribution,

20:18.000 --> 20:19.520
yeah, it might be a watch.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.320
There might be a lot of half the country hoping

20:22.320 --> 20:25.120
for more redistribution in the abstract,

20:25.120 --> 20:29.600
half the country still bed into they're gonna strike it rich.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.320
So maybe let's hold off this redistribution stuff.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.800
I know I'm way behind on my mortgage and I'm in medical bed,

20:35.800 --> 20:40.120
but I'm one good move away from being wealthy.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.880
Of course, there's some aspect of that.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.640
When you compare America to, let's say Western Europe,

20:45.640 --> 20:47.560
I think you would find that Americans are,

20:47.560 --> 20:49.600
one, more welcoming of immigrants

20:49.600 --> 20:51.280
in a lot of countries in Western Europe.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.680
So Americans, for example,

20:52.680 --> 20:55.040
even a lot of people who vote for Trump,

20:55.040 --> 20:58.120
one, they vastly overestimate the amount of

20:59.120 --> 21:01.840
undocumented immigration the United States has,

21:01.840 --> 21:03.000
but more generally,

21:03.000 --> 21:07.600
therefore higher amounts of legal immigration

21:07.600 --> 21:11.280
and therefore tightening the border at the same time.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.040
So which is very different than some

21:13.040 --> 21:15.720
of these xenophobic appeals in Europe.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.360
A vast majority of Americans are for things

21:18.360 --> 21:19.680
like birthright citizenship.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.160
My parents came to the US in 1988.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.080
I was born in 1989.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.160
I would imagine that maybe not as commanding

21:28.160 --> 21:30.560
of a majority as it was in the past,

21:30.560 --> 21:33.680
but probably a majority of Republicans

21:33.680 --> 21:36.880
would agree that I have a right to be a US citizen.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.520
That's not the case in a lot of European countries.

21:41.560 --> 21:45.240
Most of those countries don't have birthright citizenship

21:45.240 --> 21:48.680
like we have throughout most of the Western hemisphere.

21:48.680 --> 21:49.880
On a host of other issues,

21:49.880 --> 21:53.400
I think you'll find that Americans as a whole,

21:53.400 --> 21:57.080
especially young people, hold more progressive views

21:57.080 --> 22:00.920
than their peers in the advanced capitalist world

22:00.920 --> 22:04.520
in Europe and even Japan, South Korea.

22:05.800 --> 22:10.120
This is a good starting point for us

22:10.120 --> 22:11.840
from progressive politics.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.320
And I think that we shouldn't let Trump's appeal

22:14.320 --> 22:17.760
maybe make us too pessimistic

22:17.760 --> 22:21.920
about where most Americans are on these issues.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.840
Yeah, I agree because and I think

22:24.840 --> 22:27.840
that is what makes this contrast so interesting to me

22:27.840 --> 22:31.600
is that you feel the groundswell of support for these issues.

22:31.600 --> 22:36.160
I mean, it's literally just here on YouTube

22:36.160 --> 22:38.840
when I put in the title of something,

22:38.840 --> 22:40.760
Billionaires Capitalism, right?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.880
I get more views when I do that, right?

22:42.880 --> 22:45.040
Because the audience is like, oh my God,

22:45.040 --> 22:47.040
yes, someone is saying the thing that I wanna hear, right?

22:47.040 --> 22:49.880
Like I can tell that there's an undercurrent.

22:49.880 --> 22:52.040
I guess my job sort of as a comedian and broadcaster

22:52.040 --> 22:53.200
to know how people are feeling

22:53.200 --> 22:54.920
and to make things that speak to that

22:54.920 --> 22:57.800
that also line up with what I personally believe,

22:57.800 --> 23:00.880
I can sense that undercurrent as can so many other people

23:00.880 --> 23:03.040
and the contrast between it

23:03.040 --> 23:06.640
and the electoral success is like somewhat fascinating.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.240
You see all these positive signs,

23:08.240 --> 23:10.440
but you also see, well, hold on a second,

23:10.440 --> 23:13.040
why aren't politicians who espouse

23:13.040 --> 23:14.840
some of these policies doing better?

23:14.840 --> 23:17.480
But before we get deeper into that, I'd love actually,

23:17.480 --> 23:18.760
I think we waited a little too long

23:18.760 --> 23:20.640
in the podcast to do this.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.480
When you talk about socialism and democratic socialism,

23:23.480 --> 23:25.640
do you have a capsule summary of what you mean by that?

23:25.640 --> 23:27.680
Because I don't want to, you know,

23:27.680 --> 23:28.880
people are maybe feeling in the blank

23:28.880 --> 23:33.040
of what they believe that your political beliefs

23:33.040 --> 23:34.800
or project is.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.200
Well, fundamentally to me, socialism is about

23:37.200 --> 23:40.120
at a minimum securing people's social

23:40.120 --> 23:44.280
and economic necessities and saying that people

23:44.280 --> 23:47.040
are entitled to certain things just by virtue of being born.

23:47.040 --> 23:50.600
So at the very least, that means the state

23:50.600 --> 23:55.600
as a provider of last resort for things like healthcare,

23:56.480 --> 23:59.480
childcare, housing, you know, nutrition.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.880
So they're making sure we have that baseline

24:01.880 --> 24:04.120
of a welfare state.

24:05.040 --> 24:08.000
Secondly, to me, it's about extended democracy

24:08.000 --> 24:11.160
from purely the formal political realm

24:11.160 --> 24:13.920
into the economic realm as well.

24:13.920 --> 24:18.280
So if we were to agree that democracy is a good thing

24:18.280 --> 24:21.640
at the ballot box, why shouldn't we have greater degrees

24:21.640 --> 24:23.600
of democracy at our workplace?

24:23.600 --> 24:27.800
And within those two broad sets of principles,

24:27.800 --> 24:30.040
I think you could have a lot of different forms.

24:30.040 --> 24:35.040
So I don't suppose that a centrally planned economy

24:35.040 --> 24:37.720
would be a great system to live under.

24:37.720 --> 24:40.080
You know, I think there's certain both incentive

24:40.080 --> 24:45.080
and informational problems that arise in those systems.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.760
Yeah.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.080
But you could still have markets

24:49.080 --> 24:52.160
where you have an employee owned

24:52.160 --> 24:55.360
or worker owners controlling their workplaces

24:55.360 --> 24:58.240
and competing with each other to produce goods and services

24:58.240 --> 25:02.960
and a private sector for consumer goods and services

25:02.960 --> 25:05.680
while also having a larger state sector

25:05.680 --> 25:08.320
that secures things like healthcare

25:08.320 --> 25:12.040
or some of the big, what economists would call

25:12.040 --> 25:15.440
natural monopolies like our, you know,

25:15.440 --> 25:17.200
railroad network or things like that

25:17.200 --> 25:20.280
where we feel like maybe it would be fine for there

25:20.280 --> 25:23.720
to just be one actor in the sphere.

25:23.720 --> 25:27.920
And we'd rather not be a giant corporate actor.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.720
We'd rather have the state where in theory

25:30.720 --> 25:34.040
we have greater scope to control the realm of state action.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.800
So as a democratic socialist, part of what I believe in

25:36.800 --> 25:41.800
is in a sense a reconciliation of liberalism and socialism.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.640
So for example, I think rights are great.

25:46.640 --> 25:50.360
And it's great to have this idea that yes, democracy

25:50.360 --> 25:52.520
is excellent in most spheres of life,

25:52.520 --> 25:54.960
but there are certain things where I don't want my neighbor

25:54.960 --> 25:57.840
intruding on my personal consumption choice.

25:57.840 --> 26:01.680
I don't want my neighbor or the majority restricting

26:01.680 --> 26:06.160
on my ability to speak freely or to do my own thing.

26:06.160 --> 26:09.120
And I think those are great aspects of liberalism.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.320
And I think they're perfectly reconcilable

26:12.320 --> 26:16.440
with a socialism that tries to secure people's rights

26:16.440 --> 26:21.440
to develop into individuals that can truly,

26:22.560 --> 26:23.920
you know, reach their potentials

26:23.920 --> 26:28.920
and can participate in this, in our society.

26:29.360 --> 26:32.440
Because, you know, right now I think we take for granted

26:32.440 --> 26:35.360
as Americans that a kid born in, you know,

26:35.360 --> 26:39.640
Fairfield, Connecticut is going to have a radically different

26:41.120 --> 26:44.800
life and life outcomes and opportunities as a kid born,

26:44.800 --> 26:48.920
you know, 20, 30 miles away and in Hartford or Waterbury.

26:48.920 --> 26:51.120
And I'm doing very Connecticut example.

26:51.120 --> 26:56.600
Oh, everybody is aware of the socioeconomic strata

26:56.600 --> 26:58.920
of different Connecticut cities and towns.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.440
I think we all know this.

27:00.440 --> 27:01.280
No, I know what you're talking about.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.080
You're talking about like where I grew up on Long Island

27:03.080 --> 27:04.400
versus Brownsville, Brooklyn, right?

27:04.400 --> 27:07.280
Or pick your neighborhood where you're like,

27:07.280 --> 27:08.840
oh, yeah, that's the bad part of town.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.440
And this is the good part of town, right?

27:10.440 --> 27:13.080
We just take for granted that, you know,

27:13.080 --> 27:16.520
some kids going to public schools in some neighborhoods,

27:16.520 --> 27:18.880
we're not even like Britain where, yeah, of course,

27:18.880 --> 27:21.280
we ship people out to fancy boarding schools

27:21.280 --> 27:22.400
are going to have different outcomes.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.680
But public schools, we take for granted

27:24.680 --> 27:26.640
that some of them are going to produce doctors

27:26.640 --> 27:29.680
and lawyers and engineers and other schools

27:29.680 --> 27:31.640
are going to produce dropouts.

27:31.640 --> 27:35.000
And that's not normal for a rich country

27:35.000 --> 27:37.200
where we could easily solve that problem, not even

27:37.200 --> 27:41.480
through socialist revolution, but through tax and transfers

27:41.480 --> 27:43.640
and investments and jobs programs

27:43.640 --> 27:45.200
and a host of other things.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.160
Yeah, I thought your answer was interesting there

27:47.160 --> 27:51.440
because you sort of gave us the entire scope all the way

27:51.440 --> 27:53.600
from the minimal to the maximal version of socialism.

27:53.600 --> 27:58.080
You ended by talking about a substantially different economic

27:58.080 --> 28:01.040
system that has a lot more state action,

28:01.040 --> 28:03.680
worker cooperatives that are competing with each other.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.520
We could dive into that.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.320
But you also had, on the other hand,

28:08.320 --> 28:13.320
talking about simply expanded social welfare programs

28:13.320 --> 28:14.960
of the kind that we're already used to.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.560
Like we already provide in America

28:17.560 --> 28:20.400
many of the types of programs that you're talking about.

28:20.400 --> 28:24.720
We have a somewhat socialized version of education.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.320
We have public school K through 12.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.280
We do not have that for higher education.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.440
And we could talk about ways that we

28:32.440 --> 28:35.960
could expand that for public education

28:35.960 --> 28:39.000
so that your zip code does not determine how much,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.920
that we don't fund public schools via property taxes,

28:41.920 --> 28:45.480
meaning wealthier areas have better schools.

28:45.480 --> 28:48.200
And what I find really interesting

28:48.200 --> 28:50.480
is that in the last couple of years,

28:50.480 --> 28:55.520
we have tested a lot of the most immediate socialist ideas

28:55.520 --> 28:56.800
if we want to label them that way.

28:56.800 --> 29:02.640
During the pandemic, there was massively increased welfare

29:02.640 --> 29:05.480
payment or welfare payments of general kinds

29:05.480 --> 29:07.200
to folks during the pandemic.

29:07.200 --> 29:13.480
We had expanded tax credits, child welfare, et cetera,

29:13.480 --> 29:15.520
unemployment benefits.

29:15.520 --> 29:19.960
And those had huge beneficial impacts on people's lives

29:19.960 --> 29:22.200
that then a couple of years later were removed.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.560
Also, going back to the 2020 election,

29:24.600 --> 29:26.720
when Joe Biden came into office,

29:26.720 --> 29:33.040
he at least acted as though he was going to be much more of a,

29:33.040 --> 29:34.240
I don't want to say a socialist,

29:34.240 --> 29:37.360
but he was proclaiming himself sort

29:37.360 --> 29:39.080
of the next coming of FDR, right?

29:39.080 --> 29:40.920
He was going to do New Deal-style stuff.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.560
And he did some of it, giant infrastructure spending,

29:43.560 --> 29:45.600
et cetera, antitrust enforcement.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.080
Those were all things that I expected an Elizabeth Warren

29:48.080 --> 29:51.880
or a Bernie Sanders president to do, not a Joe Biden.

29:51.880 --> 29:57.000
And so it feels on the policy level, holy shit,

29:57.000 --> 30:00.320
some of these things have become not impossible in America,

30:00.320 --> 30:02.560
even if we're not sure if they're going to stick around.

30:02.560 --> 30:03.720
Do you have any view on that?

30:03.720 --> 30:06.400
Yeah, I think that one interesting, first of all,

30:06.400 --> 30:08.840
I think that the infrastructure bill

30:08.840 --> 30:11.800
was a positive development.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.640
It was over a trillion dollars of funding

30:13.640 --> 30:16.920
for Roadsbridge's mass transit rail service.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.320
Obviously, that's better than what

30:18.320 --> 30:20.520
we would have gotten from a Trump administration.

30:20.520 --> 30:26.320
Obviously, it's a policy success.

30:26.320 --> 30:31.640
But I guess that sometimes the United States,

30:31.640 --> 30:35.720
the reason why a lot of Americans feel like, oh, well,

30:35.720 --> 30:39.320
we're already trying massive socialist-style spending

30:39.320 --> 30:42.800
in the US, and we already have this massive welfare state,

30:42.800 --> 30:46.760
but it just doesn't work, is because we tend

30:46.760 --> 30:49.680
to have quite inefficiently designed programs.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.040
When we do spend money on welfare,

30:53.040 --> 30:57.160
we needlessly mean-tested, and we waste time and resources,

30:57.160 --> 30:59.320
and we weaken these programs by saying,

30:59.320 --> 31:03.040
you have to be this poor to use it.

31:03.040 --> 31:05.720
Not only that, it does create real incentives

31:05.720 --> 31:08.960
and disincentives, and it creates resentment towards,

31:08.960 --> 31:10.640
let's say if you want to use this category,

31:10.640 --> 31:13.120
it's kind of a made-up category, but the lower middle class

31:13.120 --> 31:15.720
feels like, oh, well, I'm struggling,

31:15.720 --> 31:17.680
or the working poor feels like I'm struggling,

31:17.680 --> 31:20.200
but I don't qualify for something that I qualify for

31:20.200 --> 31:22.880
if I just worked a little bit less,

31:22.880 --> 31:27.680
and you end up dividing up working-class people

31:27.680 --> 31:30.040
that have invested interest in protecting

31:30.040 --> 31:33.240
a lot of the same programs, and those people who

31:33.240 --> 31:37.120
might be working and might not qualify, for example,

31:37.120 --> 31:42.080
for Medicaid would benefit from living in a community,

31:42.080 --> 31:44.080
because they already live in these areas,

31:44.080 --> 31:47.280
with their neighbors who are able to access

31:47.280 --> 31:49.360
good health care and things like that.

31:49.360 --> 31:52.360
So it's both the design of the programs isn't great,

31:52.360 --> 31:55.240
and often we tend to create programs

31:55.240 --> 32:00.520
where we allow corporations to push prices sky-high

32:00.520 --> 32:02.240
for certain things like health care,

32:02.240 --> 32:05.800
and our solution to the problem is by subsidizing the poorest

32:05.800 --> 32:07.360
so they're able to access this market,

32:07.360 --> 32:09.600
but we're doing nothing to address the cost of things.

32:09.600 --> 32:13.160
So with education, we're doing this, higher education,

32:13.160 --> 32:15.800
and with health care, whereas in other more

32:15.800 --> 32:20.040
state-ified systems, you're able to find ways

32:20.040 --> 32:23.840
to more radically reduce cost, and that's

32:23.840 --> 32:27.960
a reason why we spend a larger percentage of our GDP

32:27.960 --> 32:31.520
on health care than other countries like even the UK,

32:31.520 --> 32:33.720
which has a system more expensive than Medicare

32:33.720 --> 32:36.840
for all our main demand of the United States,

32:36.840 --> 32:41.080
but an entire national health service.

32:41.080 --> 32:45.160
So I often think that even things that the bill back better

32:45.160 --> 32:47.920
kind of would emerge out of it, and would actually

32:47.920 --> 32:50.160
get passed the infrastructure bill,

32:50.160 --> 32:53.120
I question the design of some of those things.

32:53.120 --> 33:00.000
Are we just subsidizing willy-nilly a lot of green companies?

33:00.000 --> 33:00.560
Sure.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.320
I'd rather subsidize them than other forms of capital,

33:03.320 --> 33:06.360
but are we actually controlling the outcomes of these subsidies

33:06.360 --> 33:08.160
or are we just throwing money at things?

33:08.160 --> 33:08.880
Right.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.440
Are we just giving money to more corporations

33:11.440 --> 33:15.040
that we like maybe a little bit better,

33:15.040 --> 33:18.360
but we're not getting at the root of the problem?

33:18.360 --> 33:19.160
Hey, everybody.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.920
I know we're in the ad break, but we're doing something

33:20.920 --> 33:22.000
a little bit different today.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.600
Today, I'm going to tell you about an amazing group of people

33:24.600 --> 33:26.920
who did not pay us anything to be a part of the show.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.640
We just think they do amazing work,

33:28.640 --> 33:30.720
and we wanted you to know about them.

33:30.720 --> 33:33.600
You might remember back in 2018, those heart-wrenching stories

33:33.600 --> 33:36.720
of families torn apart by border patrol, refugee children

33:36.720 --> 33:38.200
being pulled away from their parents

33:38.200 --> 33:40.880
who were in turn deported to their home countries.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.680
It was devastating then, and it's just as devastating now,

33:43.680 --> 33:46.160
with hundreds of families still not reunited

33:46.160 --> 33:47.680
after all these years.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.360
You know, we discuss so many problems on factually,

33:50.360 --> 33:52.920
but I firmly believe that there is always something

33:52.920 --> 33:54.720
that can be done about those problems.

33:54.720 --> 33:57.120
And recently, I came across an organization

33:57.120 --> 34:00.800
called All Otrolado, which works to reunify families.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.400
They provide holistic legal and humanitarian support

34:03.400 --> 34:05.600
to refugees, deportees, and other migrants

34:05.600 --> 34:08.200
in the US and Tijuana through a multidisciplinary,

34:08.200 --> 34:11.200
client-centered, harm reduction-based practice.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.480
Since 2018, they have successfully brought together

34:13.480 --> 34:16.000
over 100 families torn apart by Trump's

34:16.000 --> 34:17.720
zero-tolerance policy.

34:17.720 --> 34:20.360
But reuniting those families is just the beginning.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.640
All Otrolado continues to support each family

34:22.640 --> 34:24.800
with legal aid, housing, and counseling

34:24.800 --> 34:26.840
to help heal and get back on their feet.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.760
I mean, can you imagine the agony

34:28.760 --> 34:30.480
of having your child ripped from your arms,

34:30.480 --> 34:32.760
unsure of when you'll see them again?

34:32.760 --> 34:35.280
We cannot allow such family separations to continue,

34:35.280 --> 34:37.000
so if you're like me and believe

34:37.000 --> 34:38.640
that all families belong together,

34:38.640 --> 34:42.200
then join me in supporting All Otrolado and Donate Today.

34:42.200 --> 34:44.160
You can find the link to Donate to All Otrolado

34:44.160 --> 34:45.800
in the description of this episode

34:45.800 --> 34:49.560
or go to gum.fm slash charity and Donate Today.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.880
You can also consider volunteering with the organization

34:51.880 --> 34:53.000
which offers opportunities

34:53.000 --> 34:55.080
that are both in-person and virtual.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.320
The best way to get involved

34:56.320 --> 34:58.440
is by filling out an application on their website

34:58.440 --> 35:01.640
at allotrolado.org slash volunteer.

35:01.640 --> 35:02.680
Thank you so much.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.040
Folks, today's sponsor is one

35:04.040 --> 35:06.720
I cannot recommend highly enough, Delete Me.

35:06.720 --> 35:07.840
As a factually listener,

35:07.840 --> 35:09.840
you know how much I value online privacy.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.840
Well, Delete Me has been an indispensable tool for me

35:12.840 --> 35:13.680
for many years.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.120
I've been using them long before

35:15.120 --> 35:17.400
they even started advertising on this show.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.520
This day and age, it is shockingly simple

35:19.520 --> 35:21.720
for data brokers to peddle your personal information

35:21.720 --> 35:22.840
without your consent.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.520
These data brokers may be selling your name,

35:24.520 --> 35:25.720
phone number, and home address,

35:25.720 --> 35:28.160
and you might never even know it's happening.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.720
Trying to locate and remove all this data yourself

35:30.720 --> 35:32.520
can feel like an impossible task,

35:32.520 --> 35:34.600
but that is where Delete Me shines.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.120
Their team of experts tirelessly scour the web

35:37.120 --> 35:39.960
to track down and wipe out your personal data.

35:39.960 --> 35:40.880
In just seven days,

35:40.880 --> 35:43.280
you will receive a detailed report of their findings

35:43.280 --> 35:44.120
and believe it or not,

35:44.120 --> 35:46.280
a whopping 41% of Americans

35:46.280 --> 35:48.160
are vulnerable to online harassment

35:48.160 --> 35:51.040
from doxing to scams and even identity theft.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.120
In some cases, having your info online

35:53.120 --> 35:54.400
can turn cyber stalking

35:54.400 --> 35:57.080
into good old fashioned in-person stalking.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.880
Protect yourself from these threats with Delete Me.

35:59.880 --> 36:00.720
So if you're like me

36:00.720 --> 36:02.280
and you value your personal privacy,

36:02.280 --> 36:04.840
I wanna make sure that your identifying personal details

36:04.840 --> 36:06.160
are not floating around the internet

36:06.160 --> 36:07.520
where anybody can buy them.

36:07.520 --> 36:10.160
Well, you can get 20% off your Delete Me plan

36:10.160 --> 36:12.680

36:12.680 --> 36:15.000
and use promo code adam at checkout.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.240
That's joindeleteme.com slash adam, code adam.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.400
I wholeheartedly recommend this service.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.560
Check out Delete Me.

36:21.560 --> 36:22.400
Folks, you know,

36:22.400 --> 36:24.360
I am all about those little pick-me-ups throughout the day.

36:24.360 --> 36:25.800
Whether it's tackling work tasks

36:25.800 --> 36:27.360
or conquering chores around the house,

36:27.360 --> 36:29.120
treating myself is a must.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.120
And you know what gets me smiling every time?

36:31.120 --> 36:32.240
Japanese snacks.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.960
Not only are they bursting with flavor,

36:33.960 --> 36:35.800
but their cute packaging and quirky vibes

36:35.800 --> 36:37.560
add an extra layer of fun.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.280
That is why teaming up with Bokksu,

36:39.280 --> 36:41.000
a Japanese snack subscription box

36:41.000 --> 36:42.680
has been such an absolute delight

36:42.680 --> 36:43.800
because these are not just

36:43.800 --> 36:45.600
your run-of-the-mill grocery store snacks.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.760
Each month, Bokksu brings you over 20 unique treats

36:48.760 --> 36:51.200
that you can normally find only in Japan.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.720
Plus, they throw in a nifty guide packed with info

36:53.720 --> 36:56.080
about each snack and Japanese culture.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.400
Snacking while learning?

36:57.400 --> 36:58.240
Are you kidding?

36:58.240 --> 37:00.320
It's like this was literally made for me.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.920
Oh, and each box ships free from Japan straight to your door.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.400
I happen to have a box right here

37:05.400 --> 37:06.320
and let me tell you something.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.720
I loved the first box they sent so much.

37:08.720 --> 37:09.640
I told our ad people,

37:09.640 --> 37:11.720
please make sure that Bokksu re-ups

37:11.720 --> 37:14.280
because I gotta get another box of these snacks.

37:14.280 --> 37:17.600
First of all, check out this incredible guide here

37:17.600 --> 37:19.280
full of beautiful photos.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.880
It tells you about all the different snacks.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.280
You know, my girlfriend's gluten-free

37:22.280 --> 37:23.480
so we can find one in here

37:23.480 --> 37:26.920
that makes sure it works for her dietary restrictions.

37:26.920 --> 37:28.040
So, but she's not here right now.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.200
So I'm gonna make sure I eat one of the gluten-y ones.

37:30.200 --> 37:32.040
Ooh, 20th century pear biscuit.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.200
This delicate biscuit is a luxurious blend

37:34.200 --> 37:36.760
of 20th century Asian pear rich cheese

37:36.760 --> 37:38.600
and decadent white chocolate.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.720
Oh, it contains wheat so that means I should eat it.

37:40.720 --> 37:41.720
All right, let me find it here.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.680
20th century pear biscuit.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.000
Okay, here we go, found it.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.720
20th century pear biscuit.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.840
Cute little packaging, let me give it a try.

37:49.920 --> 37:50.760
Oh my gosh.

37:52.440 --> 37:53.600
That is so good.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.120
Oh, the pear flavor is really strong.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.960
Mm, it's like a strong aroma.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.240
Next to this crunchy biscuit,

38:00.240 --> 38:02.320
the textural contrast is really wonderful.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.240
I mean, that is so good.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.080
And guess what?

38:05.080 --> 38:08.400
There are 19 other different snacks in here for me to try.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.760
I love this service so much.

38:10.760 --> 38:11.640
And you know why?

38:11.640 --> 38:13.720
My favorite thing about it is that they support

38:13.720 --> 38:16.000
small family-run businesses in Japan.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.640
Bokksu has sourced these treats

38:17.640 --> 38:20.800
by working with over 245 small makers in Japan,

38:20.800 --> 38:22.160
helping out their businesses

38:22.160 --> 38:23.920
and helping to preserve their traditions.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.960
So if you love Japanese snacks as much as I do

38:25.960 --> 38:27.000
and if you wanna try snacks

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
that you literally cannot get anywhere else

38:29.000 --> 38:30.840
outside of going to Japan yourself,

38:30.840 --> 38:32.600
you have gotta try out Bokksu.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.600
Right now, you can use the code FACTUALLY

38:34.600 --> 38:37.920
for $15 off your first order on bokksu.com.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.480
That's code FACTUALLY for $15 off your first order

38:40.480 --> 38:41.560
on bokksu.com.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.400
Tell them Adam sent you

38:42.400 --> 38:44.160
and now I gotta finish these snacks.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.000
Oh man, that's really good.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.120
I'm glad she's gluten-free, so I could eat this one.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.760
Staying on healthcare for a second,

38:52.760 --> 38:55.720
so much, so many times when we describe,

38:55.720 --> 38:58.400
hey, here's what they do in Europe.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.840
Here's how they organize a system

38:59.840 --> 39:02.440
or here's how we could tweak our current subsidies

39:02.440 --> 39:04.720
to make them better, et cetera.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.680
We're talking about improvements

39:06.680 --> 39:09.600
that just in literal fact would be better, right?

39:09.600 --> 39:12.240
Like when we talk about the American healthcare system,

39:12.240 --> 39:16.080
we can go down this list of it's so expensive,

39:16.080 --> 39:18.120
it's expensive because of multiple insurance companies

39:18.120 --> 39:19.520
and because of the capitalist incentive.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.360
If we had a single-payer system,

39:21.360 --> 39:22.680
we would have better health outcomes,

39:22.680 --> 39:23.800
everything would be cheaper

39:23.800 --> 39:25.520
and this is being done around the globe.

39:25.520 --> 39:29.640
It's sort of like incontrovertibly better in every way

39:29.640 --> 39:31.920
and yet in the United States,

39:31.920 --> 39:34.160
what is, you know, should almost be,

39:34.160 --> 39:35.760
hey, there's an asteroid headed towards Earth,

39:35.760 --> 39:36.960
let's look at it, it's up there,

39:36.960 --> 39:40.240
this is real, you know, we know this for a fact,

39:40.240 --> 39:43.360
becomes a political position that, you know,

39:43.360 --> 39:45.080
rises and falls in popularity

39:45.080 --> 39:47.760
and you know, I'll say right now, Medicare for All,

39:47.760 --> 39:51.560
that is the socialist and the sort of birdie movement ask.

39:51.560 --> 39:55.000
It's also sort of faded in popularity again in our politics.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.200
It is less a part of our politics than it was five years ago.

39:58.200 --> 40:01.920
And so it's such a strange state of affairs

40:01.920 --> 40:04.560
that again, you know, a single-payer system,

40:04.560 --> 40:07.000
better in every way, anyone who dives into the data,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.560
it's very hard to argue that it wouldn't be.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.000
It's very hard to defend the current system

40:11.000 --> 40:14.760
and yet it seems so far from us being able to implement

40:14.760 --> 40:16.840
what's like truly a common sense reform.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.160
Why do you think that is

40:19.160 --> 40:20.160
and what do you think the prospects are

40:20.160 --> 40:22.000
in the future for that kind of program?

40:22.000 --> 40:23.880
Well, I think in this case, what's interesting is

40:23.880 --> 40:25.880
you have a chunk of the American public

40:25.880 --> 40:29.920
that is already covered under a single-payer system,

40:29.920 --> 40:33.640
be it retirees and also the poor,

40:33.640 --> 40:37.400
and veterans as well who are covered through the VA

40:37.400 --> 40:39.080
in an underfunded system,

40:39.080 --> 40:41.720
but a system that's closer to the British NHS

40:41.720 --> 40:43.400
than anything else.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.000
So that chunk of Americans

40:45.000 --> 40:47.480
are already covered by socialized medicine.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.040
Then you have a chunk of Americans

40:49.040 --> 40:51.360
who have stable jobs,

40:51.360 --> 40:55.120
either they're lucky enough to have the old union jobs

40:55.120 --> 40:58.040
and be a part of that 10% of the economy

40:58.040 --> 41:00.520
that's covered under union contracts

41:00.520 --> 41:03.440
or their manager or professionals

41:03.440 --> 41:07.440
or others who have stable healthcare.

41:07.440 --> 41:10.600
So then you have to kind of go down the list

41:10.600 --> 41:13.560
until you find people who are getting really squeezed

41:13.560 --> 41:14.760
by the current system.

41:14.760 --> 41:18.920
Now, the new system would be better for a lot of people.

41:19.920 --> 41:24.920
If we retain current spending for Medicaid and Medicare,

41:27.200 --> 41:31.440
then in a system where we're better able to control costs,

41:31.440 --> 41:34.200
we could actually provide more services

41:34.200 --> 41:37.360
under Medicare, Medicaid.

41:37.360 --> 41:42.360
If we had employers no longer responsible for healthcare,

41:43.840 --> 41:45.360
then workers in America would be able

41:45.360 --> 41:48.120
to use that extra bargaining power to demand

41:48.120 --> 41:51.240
not just the platinum healthcare benefits

41:51.240 --> 41:55.840
or their employers to pay for their HRAs

41:55.840 --> 41:58.000
or these other tax-affirmed programs

41:58.000 --> 42:00.920
like FSAs and HSAs.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.040
If anyone's listened to this from the UK,

42:03.040 --> 42:06.800
they probably just think we're insane with these acronyms,

42:06.800 --> 42:08.880
but this is how complicated our system is,

42:08.880 --> 42:10.680
but they'd be able to use that bargaining power

42:10.680 --> 42:13.000
that's often spent by unions

42:13.000 --> 42:17.160
talking about these private market benefit schemes

42:17.160 --> 42:20.360
and actually use it towards wages or hours worked

42:20.360 --> 42:24.360
or conditions or something more bread and butter.

42:24.360 --> 42:28.600
So a lot of people would benefit from the new system,

42:28.600 --> 42:30.600
but if they feel like they're getting enough

42:30.600 --> 42:32.520
from the current system,

42:32.520 --> 42:35.240
and if they're also in a perverse way,

42:35.240 --> 42:36.840
maybe benefiting from the fact

42:36.840 --> 42:39.360
that there's 20, 25 million people

42:39.360 --> 42:41.960
who are essentially either not insured

42:41.960 --> 42:44.680
or who are unable to access their benefits

42:44.680 --> 42:47.000
because of how high the deductibles are,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.920
they have the advantage of having,

42:49.920 --> 42:54.920
let's say shorter wait times than in other systems.

42:55.120 --> 42:57.560
It doesn't really equal that

42:57.560 --> 42:59.400
because in practice,

43:01.280 --> 43:04.400
you'd always encourage more doctors to join

43:04.400 --> 43:05.560
and if people are worried about,

43:05.560 --> 43:06.960
oh, in single payer systems,

43:06.960 --> 43:09.800
you could see your primary care position right away,

43:09.800 --> 43:13.080
but if you want to see a specialist that's sometimes longer

43:13.080 --> 43:16.280
or sometimes the state kind of does its own triage

43:17.040 --> 43:18.520
if you really need to see a specialist,

43:18.520 --> 43:19.680
you'll see one tomorrow,

43:19.680 --> 43:23.040
but if you need to see a dermatologist

43:23.040 --> 43:25.560
for a cosmetic skin condition,

43:25.560 --> 43:29.360
then you might have to wait three, four weeks.

43:29.360 --> 43:30.240
That sort of thing.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.320
You could just pay specialists more in the system.

43:32.320 --> 43:36.800
You could find ways to fix this,

43:36.800 --> 43:39.040
but I think that the constituency

43:39.040 --> 43:43.360
that really is materially motivated to go out there

43:43.360 --> 43:48.360
and to change US healthcare is actually not that massive

43:48.680 --> 43:51.120
unless we have a politician,

43:51.120 --> 43:54.160
a movement articulating the benefits

43:54.160 --> 43:56.920
in a clear and concise way like Bernie did.

43:56.920 --> 43:58.520
The entire Bernie campaign,

43:58.520 --> 44:02.360
many of the people I know doing work around Medicare for all

44:02.360 --> 44:07.360
were already insured by good employer-sponsored plans.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.960
So it wasn't just self-interest.

44:11.080 --> 44:14.520
I think it was about tying it to a broader vision of change

44:14.520 --> 44:18.440
and taking on a really powerful forces,

44:18.440 --> 44:20.360
that the medical industry.

44:20.360 --> 44:24.400
Well, it's not just the medical industry though,

44:24.400 --> 44:27.440
it's also like a lot of the public

44:27.440 --> 44:29.520
has a vested interest in the current system.

44:29.520 --> 44:33.120
You mentioned unions which would not have,

44:33.120 --> 44:37.600
unions in the United States generally bargain for healthcare

44:37.600 --> 44:40.920
and they have to spend maybe one out of every three

44:40.920 --> 44:41.760
cycles.

44:41.760 --> 44:43.280
We got to make sure we shore up our health insurance plan.

44:43.280 --> 44:45.160
We got to make sure the plan is really good.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.960
And hey, if there was a state-sponsored health insurance,

44:47.960 --> 44:49.400
they wouldn't have to do so, right?

44:49.400 --> 44:51.080
They could just focus on wages instead.

44:51.080 --> 44:54.680
That argument's true and yet many unions

44:54.680 --> 44:56.240
have not supported Medicare for all

44:56.240 --> 44:58.880
because the members think,

44:58.880 --> 45:01.160
well, hold on a second, I have great healthcare now,

45:01.160 --> 45:02.720
I don't know what this plan would be like,

45:02.720 --> 45:03.680
maybe it would be worse.

45:03.680 --> 45:06.440
A, there's a huge education hurdle,

45:06.440 --> 45:08.520
but then also sometimes the leadership of the unions

45:08.560 --> 45:11.160
is like, well, healthcare is what we provide.

45:11.160 --> 45:14.080
Like that is why people are excited to be a member

45:14.080 --> 45:16.920
of the union is because they get the healthcare.

45:16.920 --> 45:18.760
So if we don't give healthcare,

45:18.760 --> 45:21.480
how do we know that we can get our members to show up

45:21.480 --> 45:22.720
if we need to go on strike, et cetera?

45:22.720 --> 45:24.560
Maybe they won't need us as much anymore.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.360
And so those are, and by the way,

45:26.360 --> 45:30.440
those are ways that good people in good faith

45:30.440 --> 45:32.000
in the movement can end up,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.680
the incentives push them in that direction.

45:34.680 --> 45:38.480
And so it seems like there's still,

45:38.480 --> 45:41.440
even though it all pencils outright,

45:41.440 --> 45:44.200
there are sort of institutional barriers,

45:44.200 --> 45:47.720
even in folks who, you would think that as a socialist,

45:47.720 --> 45:50.920
you would be in the movement with,

45:50.920 --> 45:52.520
with folks in the labor movement.

45:52.520 --> 45:55.320
It's like an internal tension there.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.680
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

45:56.680 --> 45:59.400
I think that there's a lot of unions

45:59.400 --> 46:02.880
who basically don't trust the government

46:02.920 --> 46:05.880
to create a plan as good as what their members enjoy now,

46:05.880 --> 46:08.240
or at least they feel like the union members

46:08.240 --> 46:09.960
feel that way in the private sector.

46:09.960 --> 46:12.160
And there's also some other unions that are afraid

46:12.160 --> 46:15.440
that if there's a continued push

46:15.440 --> 46:18.880
to make union membership volunteer,

46:18.880 --> 46:21.400
so kind of open shops instead of closed shops,

46:21.400 --> 46:26.240
that having kind of access to health insurance

46:26.240 --> 46:29.040
and people get accessing those plans

46:29.040 --> 46:30.720
through their union membership

46:30.720 --> 46:33.160
is a potentially really important part

46:33.160 --> 46:35.000
of keeping people in unions.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.840
But I think these are ultimately pretty short-sighted.

46:37.840 --> 46:40.680
I also think it's short-sighted for US industry

46:40.680 --> 46:44.640
as a whole, particularly, let's say the US auto industry

46:44.640 --> 46:49.320
that's competing with, historically competing with

46:49.320 --> 46:53.280
labor in Japan and in Germany,

46:53.280 --> 46:56.320
places that the state plays a much bigger role

46:56.320 --> 47:00.560
in health provision, but are, you know,

47:00.560 --> 47:03.000
kind of at a competitive disadvantage.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
I think the counter is that employers

47:07.040 --> 47:10.320
like having this major benefit

47:10.320 --> 47:12.920
that everybody needs tied to employment

47:12.920 --> 47:15.440
because it keeps people at their firms.

47:15.440 --> 47:18.280
And again, they make the calculation

47:18.280 --> 47:23.280
that it may be the control that they get over workers

47:23.320 --> 47:27.320
and this leverage is more important than the savings.

47:27.320 --> 47:29.800
But I think there's a host of small businesses

47:29.800 --> 47:34.800
and others that would benefit from not having this burden.

47:36.960 --> 47:39.280
Yeah, I mean, I think you're right that it's short-sighted.

47:39.280 --> 47:42.280
It's a sort of short-term or current benefit

47:42.280 --> 47:44.520
that some of these actors currently enjoy,

47:44.520 --> 47:48.520
but that is preventing them from a greater long-term benefit.

47:48.520 --> 47:50.360
And yeah, I'm just curious from your view,

47:50.360 --> 47:51.960
how do we make progress on it?

47:52.000 --> 47:55.320
You said, you know, it sort of needs a leader

47:55.320 --> 47:57.960
like Bernie spreading the message,

47:57.960 --> 47:59.600
but Bernie did the best job of it,

47:59.600 --> 48:01.200
anyone's done in 30 years.

48:01.200 --> 48:04.160
And, you know, again, you know, the wave rolled in,

48:04.160 --> 48:06.840
but then went back.

48:06.840 --> 48:10.520
And so are there, you know, in terms of this,

48:10.520 --> 48:12.280
just looking at socialized medicine,

48:12.280 --> 48:15.520
how does one build progress towards that

48:15.520 --> 48:16.760
over the next few decades?

48:16.760 --> 48:18.520
So the reason why I keep mentioning Bernie

48:18.520 --> 48:20.560
as someone who's obviously my politics

48:20.680 --> 48:24.840
are probably a step or two to Bernie's left in certain ways.

48:24.840 --> 48:27.680
And I was a member of Socialist Movement

48:27.680 --> 48:32.000
way before the first Bernie campaign in 2015, 2016.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.480
But I keep mentioning him because I think

48:35.480 --> 48:38.080
that we're in such a hollowed-out political environment

48:39.560 --> 48:43.720
that we actually need big national politics

48:43.720 --> 48:45.760
and politics at the level of communications

48:45.760 --> 48:47.400
and politics at the level of almost like

48:47.400 --> 48:50.120
a national kind of populist articulation,

48:50.120 --> 48:52.120
the way that Trump provides it on the right.

48:52.120 --> 48:55.120
And I think Bernie for a time was providing on the left

48:55.120 --> 48:59.080
to break through this hollowed-out environment,

48:59.080 --> 49:02.440
to break through and to re-engage people with politics.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.920
So in the 2016 campaign,

49:04.920 --> 49:09.000
you saw for the first time Trump and Bernie both

49:09.000 --> 49:11.480
rallying people by the tens of thousands.

49:11.480 --> 49:13.600
Yeah, it was displays that,

49:13.600 --> 49:17.080
obviously there was a little bit of this in Obama's 2008 run,

49:17.120 --> 49:19.960
but it's something that reminds you of politics

49:19.960 --> 49:22.000
in another country, not politics,

49:22.000 --> 49:26.240
as we've known it growing up in the United States.

49:26.240 --> 49:30.840
Yeah, arena rallies for political candidates.

49:30.840 --> 49:33.640
That's not something that people were doing for Al Gore.

49:33.640 --> 49:36.560
Definitely, it would be like a once a year,

49:36.560 --> 49:39.040
they'll just do it at the DNC.

49:39.040 --> 49:40.280
You remember he did the weird thing

49:40.280 --> 49:44.000
where he kind of rebuffed Bill Clinton a little bit

49:44.000 --> 49:48.120
and aggressively made out with his wife, Al Gore.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.120
I don't remember that,

49:49.120 --> 49:50.960
but I'm gonna look it up after this show.

49:50.960 --> 49:54.440
It was kind of a like, I'm Al Gore and I live my wife.

49:54.440 --> 49:57.840
You know, that guy doesn't love his wife.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.080
I'm a wife guy.

49:59.080 --> 50:01.360
Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

50:01.360 --> 50:04.280
So, you know, I think that in this environment

50:04.280 --> 50:05.160
that's so hollowed out,

50:05.160 --> 50:07.360
one, it means that even a group as small

50:07.360 --> 50:10.840
as Democratic Socialist America or other small groups

50:10.840 --> 50:13.480
like Justice Democrats or Sunrise

50:13.480 --> 50:16.360
can actually make a difference because,

50:16.360 --> 50:18.160
and on the other side,

50:18.160 --> 50:21.280
obviously the anti-abortion activists

50:21.280 --> 50:22.120
and the Christian right

50:22.120 --> 50:23.920
can kind of make a huge difference too.

50:23.920 --> 50:28.000
With a small group of highly motivated organizers

50:28.000 --> 50:29.560
in a hollowed out political environment

50:29.560 --> 50:31.560
can have disproportionate influence.

50:31.560 --> 50:35.000
But I think that the goal of campaigns

50:35.000 --> 50:37.040
like the Sanders campaign has to be

50:37.040 --> 50:39.960
to spur people out of this malaise,

50:39.960 --> 50:42.160
then get them motivated and activated

50:42.160 --> 50:44.600
and give them a language that they could use,

50:44.600 --> 50:45.680
a framework that they could use,

50:45.680 --> 50:48.040
a set of demands that they can identify with.

50:48.040 --> 50:53.040
Where Bernie failed was that he wasn't successfully able

50:53.120 --> 50:57.760
to carry on his campaign even in a limited form

50:57.760 --> 50:59.240
through some permanent organ.

50:59.240 --> 51:02.400
So in other words, he tried to do our revolution

51:02.400 --> 51:03.440
which kind of went nowhere

51:03.440 --> 51:06.000
and he tried to do these other efforts

51:06.000 --> 51:07.480
to make his campaign permanent.

51:07.480 --> 51:09.760
But that's not something he was particularly good at.

51:09.760 --> 51:12.280
So it was up to us on the far left

51:12.280 --> 51:15.920
to build organizations like the Democratic Social for America.

51:15.920 --> 51:19.360
Whereas I think that socials politics in America

51:19.360 --> 51:21.520
is obviously what I believe in, I think it's important.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.960
But I think there's probably a broader base

51:23.960 --> 51:28.440
of for egalitarian, pro-working class politics in America

51:28.440 --> 51:33.080
that uses probably is more ideologically diffuse

51:33.080 --> 51:36.780
and also uses a different sort of language

51:36.780 --> 51:39.600
than the socials left does in the United States.

51:39.600 --> 51:43.160
But that fundamentally stands for a fairer deal

51:43.160 --> 51:46.840
for working class people and stands for defense

51:46.840 --> 51:51.480
and expansion of important social programs

51:51.480 --> 51:53.440
like Medicare for all.

51:53.440 --> 51:55.800
When you say a different sort of language

51:55.800 --> 51:57.080
than the socialists left,

51:57.080 --> 51:59.080
what do you mean than the current socialists left?

51:59.080 --> 52:01.880
Well, I think the socialists left right now,

52:01.880 --> 52:06.720
we are activists but without a huge social base.

52:06.720 --> 52:09.360
So a lot of us come from working class backgrounds

52:09.360 --> 52:12.560
and a lot of us are involved in campaigns

52:12.560 --> 52:15.000
that do connect with a lot of working class people.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.380
Like for example, there's a lot of DSA members

52:18.380 --> 52:20.920
who are actively involved in tenant rights struggles

52:20.920 --> 52:24.360
that do have an important base.

52:24.360 --> 52:29.360
But fundamentally we join DSA in ones and twos.

52:29.800 --> 52:33.960
So we often create a hot house

52:33.960 --> 52:38.700
where certain language and ideological distinctions

52:38.700 --> 52:41.620
that are not really that important or consequential

52:41.620 --> 52:45.660
to people's lives day to day take on greater consequence.

52:45.660 --> 52:47.140
Right.

52:47.140 --> 52:48.740
A lot of people reading books

52:48.740 --> 52:51.500
and getting very heated about them in closed door meetings

52:51.500 --> 52:52.820
is what you're talking about.

52:52.820 --> 52:56.380
Yeah, I wish the meetings were closed doors.

52:56.380 --> 53:00.140
So sometimes they go viral, yeah.

53:00.140 --> 53:02.780
The interesting arguments, yeah.

53:04.260 --> 53:07.180
And again, I think building a base of cadre

53:07.180 --> 53:12.180
to think about some of these more theoretical points

53:12.500 --> 53:15.380
or are committed or keep alive some of this whole language.

53:15.380 --> 53:18.100
I actually think it's useful in certain ways.

53:18.100 --> 53:22.060
But if you're not connected to a real social base,

53:22.060 --> 53:26.020
you're not challenged to try to articulate your ideas

53:26.020 --> 53:28.140
in a way every single day,

53:28.140 --> 53:32.940
in a way that wins over ordinary Americans

53:32.940 --> 53:35.420
and all their complexities.

53:35.860 --> 53:37.820
So I think that's the...

53:40.740 --> 53:44.900
Yang to Trump to back to Yang to now RFK,

53:46.260 --> 53:48.580
junior curious teamster.

53:48.580 --> 53:50.460
Like literally someone I spoke to yesterday.

53:50.460 --> 53:51.300
So...

53:51.300 --> 53:52.140
Right.

53:53.140 --> 53:55.180
And who's a person of color, by the way, which makes it...

53:55.180 --> 53:56.020
Yeah.

53:56.020 --> 53:57.420
I think that's a lot of this election

53:57.420 --> 54:03.420
because even a lot of our priors about Hispanic voters

54:03.620 --> 54:06.900
vis-a-vis Trump is not gonna be true in this election either.

54:06.900 --> 54:08.820
And the RFK junior factor is something

54:08.820 --> 54:11.060
that I personally just have not considered much

54:11.060 --> 54:12.100
until recently.

54:12.100 --> 54:13.940
Now it just seems like he's not gonna go away

54:13.940 --> 54:16.340
and he's gonna get his 15%

54:16.340 --> 54:19.540
and maybe I'm just hoping only eight of those 15

54:19.540 --> 54:22.020
will be from Biden and the rest will be from Trump.

54:22.020 --> 54:23.540
You think he's gonna get 15,

54:23.540 --> 54:26.740
you think RFK is gonna get 15% of the popular vote?

54:26.740 --> 54:29.820
I think that, well, a lot of, I think,

54:29.820 --> 54:31.580
polling would have him close to that.

54:31.580 --> 54:34.420
I think in reality, as we closer to the election,

54:34.420 --> 54:36.300
it'll become more and more polarized.

54:36.300 --> 54:41.300
I think that that RFK vote will dissipate back

54:41.380 --> 54:45.060
to both Trumps, probably 55% of it might go to Biden,

54:45.060 --> 54:46.940
the rest will go to Trump.

54:46.940 --> 54:51.540
And I think that the best bet,

54:51.540 --> 54:52.780
I'm one of the few people,

54:52.780 --> 54:54.740
and I feel like the few people in the world

54:54.740 --> 54:56.420
that just thinks that Biden's gonna win,

54:56.420 --> 55:00.260
if only because I feel like he's been hit so hard

55:00.300 --> 55:02.460
with all these negatives for so many months

55:02.460 --> 55:04.980
that it's only gonna go up from here.

55:04.980 --> 55:07.780
And Trump between his legal trouble

55:07.780 --> 55:11.380
and between just the sheer amount of vitriol

55:11.380 --> 55:13.620
that a portion of Americans have for him,

55:13.620 --> 55:17.460
I just feel like the negative polarization

55:17.460 --> 55:21.420
is people like to call it of the race.

55:21.420 --> 55:24.020
Well, we'll skew in Biden's favor

55:24.020 --> 55:25.820
because we already lived through Trump

55:25.820 --> 55:28.180
and we have, I think, concerns

55:28.180 --> 55:32.860
that the next four years of Trump would be even worse.

55:32.860 --> 55:36.060
And I just feel like that's the thing

55:36.060 --> 55:39.140
that'll motivate people who are quite discontent

55:39.140 --> 55:41.900
with Biden, like myself, to vote for him.

55:41.900 --> 55:44.660
And I would vote for Biden if I was in a swing state.

55:44.660 --> 55:48.380
I'm in New York, so I'll vote for Jill Stein or something.

55:49.940 --> 55:51.580
You know why I vote for Jill Stein?

55:51.580 --> 55:53.020
Because Jill Stein asked me,

55:53.020 --> 55:55.780
hey, Basker, are you gonna vote for me in 2016?

55:55.780 --> 55:56.780
I'm like, when?

55:56.780 --> 55:58.260
No one else hit me up.

55:58.260 --> 55:59.820
I'm not sure if it's an effective way

55:59.820 --> 56:02.660
to win a national campaign.

56:03.820 --> 56:05.700
She personally asked you.

56:05.700 --> 56:06.620
Yeah, yeah.

56:06.620 --> 56:09.820
Well, okay, but some people will say,

56:09.820 --> 56:11.820
and let's go back.

56:11.820 --> 56:13.460
Oh, actually, before I get to that,

56:13.460 --> 56:15.860
I do wanna make one point that you were talking about

56:15.860 --> 56:20.660
somebody who speaks to an actual group of working people

56:20.660 --> 56:22.300
that reminds you of, say, Sean Fain,

56:22.300 --> 56:24.700
who is saying a lot of those ideas,

56:24.700 --> 56:27.420
why do we even have billionaires, et cetera,

56:27.420 --> 56:29.340
things that maybe Bernie could have said,

56:29.340 --> 56:31.380
or that a DSA leader would say,

56:31.380 --> 56:34.420
but he's saying them to his actual members,

56:34.420 --> 56:37.780
who he understands, he knows them well,

56:37.780 --> 56:39.700
and he's trying to get them to go on strike

56:39.700 --> 56:42.820
or sign a union card or whatever it is,

56:42.820 --> 56:45.940
and that's really rooted to their struggle.

56:45.940 --> 56:50.940
It's not someone like myself at a DSA meeting

56:51.260 --> 56:52.580
with a college education saying,

56:52.580 --> 56:53.780
hey, here's what I think would be good

56:53.780 --> 56:56.660
for some people who I haven't met, for example,

56:56.660 --> 57:00.340
and that's a real difference that is meaningful, perhaps.

57:01.660 --> 57:03.820
Going back to the national election, though,

57:03.820 --> 57:08.820
you, there were people who said the same thing

57:09.460 --> 57:11.060
that you just said, I'll vote for Jill Stein

57:11.060 --> 57:14.020
because I'm pretty sure that Biden's gonna win.

57:14.020 --> 57:15.980
You did say you'd vote for him if you lived in a swing state,

57:15.980 --> 57:18.460
but there are people who said similar things in 2016,

57:18.460 --> 57:19.780
and other people are very mad at them

57:19.780 --> 57:21.940
because everyone thought Hillary Clinton was gonna win,

57:22.060 --> 57:23.980
and hey, I can just, you know,

57:23.980 --> 57:26.940
I can do whatever I want, right, for that reason.

57:27.860 --> 57:31.380
And I think this year,

57:31.380 --> 57:34.380
something that is really going to give Biden

57:34.380 --> 57:38.020
a lot of trouble is what's happening in Gaza right now,

57:38.020 --> 57:40.540
the support for Israel, et cetera,

57:40.540 --> 57:42.860
and it strikes me that this has been

57:42.860 --> 57:46.220
such a wedge through the entire left.

57:46.220 --> 57:50.340
The, you know, you had DSA members writing an open letter

57:50.340 --> 57:51.900
about why they're leaving DSA,

57:51.900 --> 57:54.260
because of, da-da-da-da-da-da, go down, you know,

57:54.260 --> 57:56.380
they wrote their DSA national leadership,

57:56.380 --> 58:00.780
put out a message that was, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

58:00.780 --> 58:03.260
You've had this happen at, you know,

58:03.260 --> 58:06.980
leftist groups and meetings throughout the country

58:06.980 --> 58:09.420
in local democratic parties, et cetera.

58:10.860 --> 58:12.780
And, you know, I've heard a lot of people say,

58:12.780 --> 58:16.220
hey, this is, regardless of how you feel about that,

58:16.220 --> 58:18.060
we are talking about, you know,

58:18.060 --> 58:20.320
we're talking about America's economic needs, right,

58:20.320 --> 58:21.960
and building socialism in America.

58:21.960 --> 58:25.080
This is a, you know, maybe this is not a distraction

58:25.080 --> 58:27.000
because we are a part of what's happening in Israel,

58:27.000 --> 58:31.120
but it's a very, you know, it's such a wrench

58:31.120 --> 58:33.640
to be thrown in at such a vulnerable moment.

58:34.560 --> 58:37.200
And so I'm curious to get into that piece of it.

58:37.200 --> 58:40.720
How do you think that the, you know,

58:40.720 --> 58:44.040
Israel's offensive against the civilians in Gaza

58:44.040 --> 58:47.200
has affected your movement?

58:48.200 --> 58:50.800
Well, I think among DSA, if anything,

58:51.840 --> 58:56.560
having the focal point of solidarity work with Palestine

58:56.560 --> 59:01.560
has been a uniting factor in the organization as a whole.

59:01.640 --> 59:03.600
I think there's some older members who objected

59:03.600 --> 59:06.920
to some of the rhetoric used right after

59:06.920 --> 59:09.040
the October 7th attacks.

59:09.040 --> 59:11.640
And I think their argument was basically,

59:11.640 --> 59:16.640
you're using a rhetoric that is preemptively condemning

59:17.880 --> 59:22.880
Israel for the response rather than focusing on

59:23.080 --> 59:26.840
the actual attack in which hundreds of civilians died,

59:26.840 --> 59:29.000
and also using rhetoric in some cases

59:29.000 --> 59:30.880
that maybe it was more appropriate

59:30.880 --> 59:34.720
to national liberation movements in the 60s and 70s

59:34.720 --> 59:39.560
than it is to an Islamist group like Hamas.

59:39.560 --> 59:44.560
I think that obviously I try to aim for some of the,

59:45.440 --> 59:48.680
in general, try to aim for a broad-based rhetoric

59:48.680 --> 59:51.040
that tries to speak beyond the converted.

59:51.040 --> 59:53.160
So I think there's probably some truth in that

59:53.160 --> 59:54.600
and some of the initial communications.

59:54.600 --> 59:57.320
But as a whole, I think in a moral and ethical sense,

59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.120
I think DSA kind of got it right,

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:04.360
which is that there was definitely going to be

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.600
a huge and disproportionate Israeli response

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.040
on a largely civilian population.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:16.040
And I think a lot of the Democratic Party,

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.960
particularly younger Democrats,

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.560
much less the far left, are united in thinking

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.760
that Israel's actions have been disproportionate,

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.040
that it's targeted civilians,

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.960
and that there needs to be an immediate ceasefire.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.000
I think they were even hearing those sorts of things

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.760
in tepid ways from the Biden administration itself

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.600
or firm figures within the State Department,

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.600
which shows a pretty wide spectrum of belief.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.280
So I do think that Biden hasn't exhibited

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.560
the courage that he needed to.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.080
I think he's done just enough

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.240
that history won't say that he was Netanyahu.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.240
And I think that's honestly been his goal.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:06.280
He hasn't been, he's been probably thinking himself,

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.840
well, I don't want to spend enough capital to end this

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.760
because the last time I spent a lot of capital

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.280
on a foreign policy issue,

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.840
his correct decision to withdraw from Afghanistan,

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.360
I got so much flack for it,

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.480
but I also don't want people to think of Netanyahu,

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.720
so I'm going to do the various, the hot mic moment,

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.200
which I actually do as a hot,

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.760
do you think was a hot mic moment,

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.880
but it might as well have been staged

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.120
at the State of the Union?

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.400
This is where he was like,

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.840
ah, man, maybe he's got to cut that out, man,

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.480
or whatever, like to somebody off the mic, yeah.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.840
Well, and he managed to just make it as awkward as possible

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.640
because he's Biden,

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.640
so he's talking about a Jewish Prime Minister.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.240
So he's like, I need to have a come to Jesus moment for Bibi.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:49.840
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.400
Is there a Jewish,

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.320
is there a Jewish counterpart to the phrase come to Jesus?

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.280
Neither of us are the ones to answer that question,

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.240
but I'm curious anyway, please go on.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.480
No, but I think, I think,

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:04.800
I think that that hopefully, as time goes on,

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:12.760
that those efforts accelerate and there is some sort of resolution. But I think this is something

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:17.640
that history will really condemn Biden and his administration for. I think that you can count

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:23.480
in the thousands of lives the amount of people that would have been saved if Biden has had acted

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:31.240
sooner. And again, even from the narrow standpoint of Israeli defense, I don't think there's a

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:38.600
credible argument that killing several thousand more civilians in the operation is going to make

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:49.880
Israel safer as opposed to continuing the conflict and perpetuity. And that being said,

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:55.880
I actually am not of the opinion that Biden's actions will be a decisive

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:08.840
factor in the race in November 2024, I think. Really? And I say this with using my words

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:13.080
carefully. I don't think this is a good thing, but I do think that a lot of voters,

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:22.040
if the Israeli assault ends in the next month or two, a lot of voters will move on by then.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:29.720
And again, I don't think they should, especially with 30 plus thousand people dead. But I think

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:35.640
they will move on for them. The news cycle will move on like we've seen time and time again in

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:44.840
these sorts of cases. And also the real politic will overwhelm people. And some of this is very

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:51.640
rational. We choose once over four years not who we want to be in charge in a positive sense,

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:56.840
but we often have to choose who we are on the far left, who we want to be in opposition to,

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:04.360
or for ordinary people like who's the lesser evil. And I think that for a lot of people,

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:12.520
that's going to be Joe Biden. And I think among a lot of voters in places like Michigan,

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:20.680
I think they're going to feel the pressure to vote for Biden. I think given the constraints of our

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:27.000
of our political system, it makes perfect sense that those people would vote for Biden.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:34.600
Then again, I do feel like the credible threat of exit is an important way to actually influence

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:39.960
mainstream Democratic Party politicians. And that's attention. That's a balancing act between

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:45.480
listening to people's concerns about a Trump, a second presidency, but also wanting to be

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:50.440
oppositional enough that we could actually be a pressure group from the outside.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.840
And I think that DSA members at an individual level in the organization has tried to do that

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:08.600
balancing act. And sometimes I think they don't get enough credit for how well they're doing that.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:16.360
I think the DSA, no endorsement is in and of itself not allowing members to do what they want

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.960
and to make their own decisions. And the vast majority of those members will vote for Biden

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:26.040
in swing states, but it also maintains DSA as a credible oppositional force in a Democratic Party

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.800
that really does need one in an American civil society that does need one.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:36.760
I really appreciate your description of it as a balancing act, because there's a constant tension

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:43.080
between, you know, when folks say, I can never vote for Biden because of his support for Netanyahu

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.480
or the United States' material support to Israel. Well, that's something that you have to accept.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.280
And yet you're like, well, hold on a second, there are two alternatives here. And, you know,

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:59.320
we don't want the worse of the two. But if you go vote blue, no matter who, then you remove the

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:06.760
ability to put any pressure on. And so you do need to find, like both things are true at once,

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:15.240
and you need to find a middle between them. And I agree that I have seen some DSA groups,

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:21.160
I think, being sophisticated politically in how they handle it. I guess my broader concern

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:29.000
when, you know, apart from my deep concern for everybody in that region and for the citizens

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.280
of Gaza, when all of that went down, and my concern about those specific policies was

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.720
the left has a reputation and a history of splintering throughout groups, not limited to DSA,

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:47.960
throughout its history. And I saw splintering happen just in my own political waters here in

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:52.920
Los Angeles, splintering occurred. People who had previously been in coalition in the movement

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:58.520
with each other suddenly said, I can never fuck with those people again. And, you know, on both

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:03.720
sides of that. And, you know, if you are interested in political change and you understand, hey, that

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:10.280
requires everyone to get on the same side, or everyone to push in the same direction, regardless

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:15.560
of your feelings of the actual policy, like to see the splintering can be difficult and lamentable.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:21.960
And so I'm curious how you think about that broader issue within left politics of, you know,

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.600
backbiting, people will complain about purity testing. I don't really like that phrase, but

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:32.120
that's a common complaint that you hear, etc. That sort of perennial problem and how can the

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:38.680
left overcome it? Well, I think that the splintering is pretty common in a lot of

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.120
of like-minded ideological groups or even just groups in general. We just happen to live in

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:53.240
society where there isn't that much organized activity anymore. This is the old kind of Putnam,

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:59.720
like bowling alone description of how it out or our socialized and our socialized.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:04.840
This book has come up on this show so many times. At some point, I got to get, he's not dead, is he?

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.560
I got to get him on the show to talk about it, because it's come up over and over again.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.440
I think Robert Putnam is still around, but he must be pretty old by this point.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:20.520
He's around. I take credit. I don't take credit. Jackabin, I think, should take some credit for

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:25.480
its resurrection because we published a few articles about it a couple of years ago. So I

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:32.600
think we got some of the left talking about it. But if you look at the history of the American

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:37.160
political right, if you look at the history of religious groups, especially a lot of the words

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:45.320
we use to describe the left, like sectarianism, where does this come from? This comes from the

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:51.640
million different splits of religious groups into sectarian groups. I think in general,

01:08:52.680 --> 01:09:00.680
it's something that I personally like to avoid. I like to try to be one ecumenical, but have my

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:05.880
beliefs, but figure out how do you create a box where we could have different ideas and have

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:10.520
contestation within that box. But like you said, still move together in the same direction,

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:18.680
and that's different than a line. A box has room for eclectic decisions and debates

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:24.280
over tactics and strategy. But as long as you figure out here are five core principles,

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:28.440
here's where we're aligned on, then we can move forward. I think sometimes when it comes to

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:34.920
an issue like Israel, Palestine, I think if our demand right now is ceasefire now,

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:39.160
I think that is a pretty broad demand that can incorporate a lot of different voices,

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:47.000
including liberal Zionists and others. Everyone from liberal Zionists to revolutionaries to

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.080
people who believe in democratic one state, I think we can all be in that tent together and we

01:09:53.080 --> 01:10:06.600
can decide, debate 67 versus 48 versus one state solution some other time or within that tent.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:12.760
So I actually think that the left in general has done a pretty good job in being led by groups,

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:18.040
like the solidarity movement. A lot of the great actions have been by groups like Jewish

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.880
voices for peace that have abused, I think really inclusive rhetoric and have talked about the fact

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:30.600
that their core members are Jewish Americans and here's why they're concerned by Israel's

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:37.640
actions. And I think, again, that's different than having a left that was so pure that said,

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:44.280
you can't say one word about Israeli civilians or you can't say one word about

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:52.280
two states or whatever. And if you say that, you can't be part of our ceasefire now movement.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:57.400
If it was like that, then I would say that we're in a moment that's too sectarian.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:04.840
I think that for now, the rhetoric I think is very good, the demand is broad and also the

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:11.160
rhetoric is about our basic human values. It's about the right of children to have access to

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:17.480
nutrition and people to not be under siege and against collective punishment, things that I

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:21.080
think are really broad. But going back to you mentioned Sean Finn before, and I think that

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:28.440
part of his appeal is that he's both a leader in the labor movement. He's both someone with a huge

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:35.800
base of support through the UAW with ordinary working class people, but also he draws on his

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:41.400
Christian values when he talks about his socialist values, when he talks about being an egalitarian

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:49.800
and when he talks about where wealth comes from and how the fruits of one's labor should be

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:55.480
distributed. And I think that's really powerful. And when I think about what kind of left wing

01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.560
rhetoric can actually reach 100, 200 million Americans, I would imagine that sounds something

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:09.320
like that. I agree with that. And looking forward is how I'd like to end here. You opened by saying

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:15.240
over the last 10 years, moved from socialism being dead to being on life support. First of all,

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:19.000
that's pretty impressive because a resurrection happened in the middle there, which is a miracle.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.320
So let's say that's an accomplishment for your movement. I would love you for you to paint a

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:29.400
picture of 10 years from now, right? Because you've said, hey, we need these charismatic leaders.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:34.680
I don't see someone stepping up in electoral politics to take the Bernie Sanders crown currently.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:42.200
No one is running for president this year with that sort of overtly socialist politics.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:50.680
By the way, DSA membership I've read has slightly declined or at least plateaued for a little bit.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.200
In terms of growth, after we've seen a lot of growth in the last 10 years,

01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:01.320
how does the movement continue growing and where do you see it in your rosiest view?

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:08.040
Well, my rosiest view, I think that a lot of the younger people who move left on key issues,

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.960
we could connect with them and get them to engage in politics. And we connect with them. We tell them

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:22.760
engaging with politics isn't just about having a persona online or having a set of likes and

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:28.280
dislikes, but actually being involved in a union. And if you're in a workplace that is

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:33.640
unionized or can't be unionized, it's getting involved in your local community. It's either

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:40.040
connecting with groups like DSA or Jewish Worship Peace, some of the far left groups that I mentioned.

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:45.160
But it also means for people who maybe have different persuasions politically,

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:52.600
connecting with the local, even becoming a delegate at the DNC, something I wouldn't do

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:57.720
in a thousand years. And my mind isn't worth my time. But for other people, that might be how

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:03.240
they connect with politics. Look, taking over your local chapter of your local party is very

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.640
powerful politically. You have to sit through a lot of really shitty meetings. But you show up

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.280
to another of those meetings, you could be running the place within a couple of years.

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:21.880
Yeah, or getting involved with your local abortion access campaign or a host of things,

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:27.080
but still identifying broadly as being on the left or being part of any egalitarian

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:34.680
current. And a current that basically says we don't want a world where people get by and get ahead

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:42.440
through bullying or where we allow people to achieve exalted positions by being bullied.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.320
We want a world in which ordinary people can work hard and be able to take care of themselves

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:58.200
and their families. And to me, like Trump embodies the very worst of Americans. One is like personally

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:05.240
pretty detestable. Even though he's occasionally funny, we could acknowledge. He's someone who just

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:13.080
constantly brags about being a bully. And his version of dealmaking is zero sum. Whereas I think

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:20.280
our vision for the United States, for the world is a very positive sum vision of expanding justice

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:26.120
and expanding prosperity and the world being a better place. And I think that's a message that

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.800
60 percent of the United States and 60 percent of the world can get behind. I don't think we'll

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:37.720
ever get a full 100. But I think that that appeal for that is far greater than where their DSA,

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:43.320
I think we have declined about 85,000 or 100,000. Either way, it's a country of 330 million people.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:48.440
So I think this broad based movement in which I think socialists have a really important role to

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:57.800
play. Connecting, I think, these values, which are really commonly shared with the idea of struggle.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:03.560
Because struggle means that it's not just we have this nice set of shared values we can all

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:10.040
march towards. But there is a small minority of people who do have a vested interest in keeping

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:16.280
people divided and keeping everything from our workplaces structured as undemocratically as they

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:23.240
are to our tax code written in the way it's written. And that's I think what liberalism is

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:30.360
often missed, this theory of politics and these theories of conflict. So I would love socialism

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:36.760
to be a complementary piece of the puzzle, changing liberalism. And then in turn, being

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:42.600
shaped by the people we're interacting with who aren't socialists, I think there's really a broad

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:48.360
movement that we can build in the here and now. Yeah. And I've seen that happen. I mean, in the

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:54.440
writer's guild, in the writer's strike, we have 10,000 to 12,000 members, depending on how you

01:16:54.440 --> 01:17:00.760
want to count. And there are genuinely folks from all political persuasions. There are Republicans

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:06.360
and Democrats and all other sorts of folks in the union. But the one thing that almost everyone in

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:13.240
the union 95%, 99% of people in the union agree on is that the bosses are trying to screw us and

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:18.920
then if we fight back, we can win. And so there's people who I know I disagree with them politically

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:23.720
on many things, but we march together in solidarity and we know that we stand there going, hey, but

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:29.800
we're doing this together right now. And that feels more important, more powerful and separate

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:38.440
from who we voted for for governor or whatever. Or what cable news channel we watch. It's a

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:47.400
politics that we live rather than simply identify with and click a button about. And the fact that

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:54.520
so many people responded to it around the country. And in my view, the reason our strike went viral

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:59.160
nationally was people watched it and said, I want to do that too. I faced that in my job. How do I

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:06.520
do that in my life? That to me was really evidence. These are ideas and a struggle with a broad appeal

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:11.000
if we can fucking figure out how to harness it. Yeah, I think you, you proved it through practice

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.240
too. You had your theory that we can make change. You brought together a diverse coalition to make

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:22.120
change and people saw the results. So now it's going to be easier the next time around. Now,

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:28.920
with the Bernie campaign, with all these other struggles, the key is to actually rack up victories

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:33.560
and to give people a sense that politics isn't just something I'm going to do for fun

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:40.280
when I have free time between the ages of 18 and 26, the time in our lives where we have the,

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:46.200
for many of us, the most free time, but that it's actually an important route to achieve tangible

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:51.080
victories. And it's something that we can continue in various forms throughout our lives. And I think

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:58.440
that's the goal of any broad left movement is to achieve some victories and then add on to the

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.960
victories. Well, I feel badly that we have talked for over an hour and I haven't even gotten into

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:10.200
your publishing work. So let's end there and tell me a little bit about where people can find the

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:15.640
work that you do at The Nation and at Jacobin and, you know, the importance of that work as your

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:22.440
final plug and telling us about what you do. Well, I'm the president of The Nation magazine,

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:26.280
which is kind of a ridiculous title, but basically the publisher of The Nation.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:32.920
You're literally, it's called The Nation. You're the president. You're the potus.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.760
You're the panodist. I don't know, there's something in there.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:43.560
And The Nation has been around since 1865. So it was founded by abolitionists in 1865. It's a

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:48.680
longest standing, you know, liberal left publication in this country. It's been

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:56.040
generally on the right side of history. All those years, 165 years on questions of

01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:02.680
one piece in the like 159 years. That was pretty bad. I'm still living in the past. In my mind,

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:10.680
it's, you know, it's not 2024. But I'm also the founding editor of Jack from Magazine,

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:15.480
which is a quarterly magazine. I think for my money, it's the best looking publication in the

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.400
entire country. The design is incredible of this magazine. Like, it's like, you want to cut the

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:24.280
pages out and put them on the wall. I subscribed for one year just to get the print product and

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:30.840
it truly is beautiful. And yeah, I'm also working on a few books, but my last one was The Socialist

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:39.320
Manifesto, which yeah, as I work on my second book now, I'm not sure how I managed to write a book

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:44.680
in the past. Like, this is like, you know, five, six years ago. So there were still smartphones

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:49.160
and all these distractions. But for some reason, it was a lot easier than now.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:54.200
Well, I look forward to the new book. And thank you so much for coming on this show,

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.960
