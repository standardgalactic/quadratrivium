00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Hello and welcome to Factually, I'm Adam Conover.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,760
Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,720
I am so excited for today's episode.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,440
We have on the show today a guest I have wanted to have

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,720
on the show for years.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,480
And frankly, one of the people I most admire

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,520
working on the internet or really in all of media today.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,800
I first saw a video from the YouTube channel ContraPoints

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,240
five years ago in my trailer while I was working

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,800
on one of the last seasons of Adam Ruins Everything.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,120
And this video blew me the fuck away.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,320
It was brilliant, it was fiendishly funny, it was stylish,

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
and it was unlike anything I had ever seen

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,400
on the platform before.

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,760
In just 30 minutes, Natalie Wynn, the host of ContraPoints,

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,720
explained the right-wing psychologist

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,760
and self-help guru, Jordan Peterson,

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,040
better than any piece of media I had ever come across.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,880
And from then on, every single one of her videos

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,800
became a must-watch for me.

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,240
What is so impressive about Natalie's work

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,960
is that she doesn't just repackage other people's thoughts

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,600
like so many people do on YouTube.

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,000
No, she delivers original philosophical insight

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,800
and analysis that is genuinely new.

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,080
But rather than deliver that in a lecture room or a book,

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,800
she puts them into video essays on YouTube

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,560
that are watched massively.

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,160
Her work has won her nearly 1.8 million YouTube followers

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,920
and she has also won a Peabody Award.

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,880
Her work is genuinely a new form of media,

32
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,360
serious philosophical work watched by millions

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,480
on the biggest platform imaginable.

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,200
And I could not be more excited to have her

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,560
on the show today.

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,360
But before we get into it, I just wanna remind you

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,920

And now let's get to my interview

49
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,520
with the writer, thinker, philosopher and YouTuber,

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,360
Natalie Nguyen, also known as ContraPoints.

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,800
Natalie, thank you so much for being on the show.

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,200
I'm thrilled to have you.

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,040
Thank you so much.

54
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,240
I am very happy to be here.

55
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,000
I've wanted to have you on the show for years.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,560
You're probably one of my favorite,

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,480
what do I call you, internet public intellectuals?

58
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,760
Like, what do you call yourself?

59
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,360
I guess I worry that public intellectuals

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,680
sets me up for failure.

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,760
But I'm gonna call myself a YouTuber

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,000
because why get more complicated than it needs to be?

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,120
But yeah, I make video essays on YouTube.

64
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,040
I've been doing that since 2016 or so.

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,040
And cover a lot of topics from politics to sexuality

66
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,720
to psychology, I guess I'll even cover.

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,560
So it's pretty broad, I guess,

68
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,520
in terms of what I'll go into.

69
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,200
But yeah, the channel is called ContraPoints.

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,640
And I feel like we have something in common in that.

71
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,160
I have said many times on this show,

72
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,160
I intended to go to grad school for philosophy.

73
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
I never did.

74
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,280
And it's been a thorn in my side ever since.

75
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,080
I have a shameful bachelor's.

76
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,720
You went for a number of years and left.

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
And now both here we are on YouTube,

78
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,560
trying to maybe use some of these ideas

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,880
in the public sphere,

80
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,240
but you do it on such an incredibly deep level.

81
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,400
Your new video, which has the title Twilight,

82
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
that's the entire title.

83
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,280
But in the video, you cover everything

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,640
from the nature of desire to sadomasochism,

85
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,200
to radical feminism,

86
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,280
and you end with this incredible insight

87
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,280
about the nature of the masculine and feminine,

88
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,520
and then containing each other.

89
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,760
And watching it, I'm like,

90
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,960
having every single sentence in the video,

91
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,600
it gives me a little mind explosion

92
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,120
of a new insider thought

93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,160
that I'm processing with everything else.

94
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,080
They're incredibly dense.

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,160
It's just such an amazing work

96
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,760
to go all the way from Twilight to that big concept.

97
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,240
Like, how do you even begin to put together

98
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
a video like that?

99
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,560
What's the first germ of it?

100
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,720
Well, I think with this video,

101
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,760
I knew I wanted to make a video about sexuality,

102
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,960
but to do that on YouTube,

103
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,280
I was in search of a PG-13 framing device.

104
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,880
And so Twilight kind of became,

105
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
I was like, okay, if I want to talk about sexuality,

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,120
but I want to do it on YouTube,

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,000
the community guidelines will just love

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,440
if this video is about Twilight

109
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,360
instead of being about something more explicit.

110
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,920
So, and also, I've been alive long enough

111
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,480
to have sat through, at this point,

112
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,200
20 years of discourse about the Twilight series.

113
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,240
So it's something that I'm very familiar with.

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,920
A lot of the complicated conversations

115
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,840
people have about sexuality

116
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,640
have been sort of magnetized to this topic in particular.

117
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,040
So, you know, a lot of the things

118
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,600
that people worry about with Twilight,

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,240
the kind of power dynamics and the sort of,

120
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,840
I guess, people worry about misogyny and all this,

121
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,720
I guess, stuff I wanted to go into in the video.

122
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,640
And so for me, Twilight was just like,

123
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,880
I just felt this was like the right case study

124
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,480
that I could attach all these wider issues to.

125
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,960
That's amazing.

126
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,720
And one of the things that's amazing about this video

127
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,320
is it has almost four million views on YouTube.

128
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,080
And, you know, some of your previous works,

129
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,800
you know, say you did a video about Jordan Peterson, right?

130
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,520
That's a wonderful, I think, philosophical,

131
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,200
that's the first thing I ever saw of yours.

132
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,400
And it was really influenced the way that I think about

133
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,600
that guy and that entire movement in, you know,

134
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,680
pseudo-intellectual circles.

135
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,720
But, you know, that's a hot topic for the algorithm, right?

136
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,400
Jordan Peterson does well.

137
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,240
Twilight, if the words Jordan Peterson

138
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,120
are in the title of the video, it'll do well.

139
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
This video is about a, you know,

140
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,120
a couple decade old romance series.

141
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,720
And the topic ranges so widely

142
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,200
from the nature of romance fiction all the way to, you know,

143
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,680
the nature of desire and sexuality itself.

144
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,200
And people are watching it in such huge numbers.

145
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,880
What do you, like, attribute that to?

146
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,120
Because, again, it's a really dense,

147
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,240
like truly philosophical work.

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,760
Well, I think people are curious about these topics.

149
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,880
And I feel like a lot of times the discourse about them

150
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,000
is of a pretty low quality.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,720
So I feel like this is another thing

152
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,120
that attracted me to this topic is that I felt like,

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,480
I feel like that there's stuff

154
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,920
that's not being said about this that I can say.

155
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,760
So, you know, I try to look for something like that

156
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,240
when I'm deciding on a video topic.

157
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,800
If it's something that I feel like a lot of people

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,280
are covering really, really well, then I'll, like,

159
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,400
well, I don't know if I can add anything to this,

160
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,840
but with this, I felt like I had something to add.

161
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,800
And yeah, I mean, I guess one reason

162
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,920
I decided to make this video is as a LGBT person,

163
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,040
I feel like, well, I'm a trans woman.

164
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,040
I'm not LGBT and T, but you know what I mean.

165
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,720
I feel like people like me were very frequently

166
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,920
asked these days to, like, provide, like,

167
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,200
to explain ourselves, like, explain your sexuality.

168
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,680
Why are people gay? Why are people trans?

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,400
Why are people, and, like, I've spent some time on YouTube

170
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,080
trying to do exactly that.

171
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,800
But I feel like, what I came to realize is, like,

172
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,840
we're trying to understand,

173
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,680
is people are trying to understand why people are gay

174
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
or why people are trans.

175
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,440
And no one even really understands

176
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,240
heterosexuality very well yet.

177
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
So it's like, why are we trying to do calculus

178
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,160
before we've figured out arithmetic?

179
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,320
So, in a way, I think the, which,

180
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,280
finally, I want to do a video about heterosexuality, right?

181
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,560
It's like, before we start talking,

182
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,960
before we get really complicated with this

183
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,320
and start talking about the sexuality of, you know,

184
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,400
trans people, like, why don't we figure out how, like,

185
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,400
this, the, you know, a Mormon housewife's sexuality works

186
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,720
in the case of Stephanie Meyer, right?

187
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,800
Because I feel like we haven't even kind of cracked that code.

188
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,680
So I guess I felt this was, like,

189
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,960
maybe a better introductory place for people

190
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,280
to start thinking about sexuality

191
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,160
than for, like, demanding that marginalized people

192
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,840
explain themselves to, to people who kind of

193
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,120
don't even have the tools needed to,

194
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
to understand it in the first place.

195
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,640
That's so funny.

196
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,680
Well, it's such a funny flip of the request too.

197
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,240
Hey, a queer person, explain yourselves to us.

198
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,040
Well, no, how about me, a queer person,

199
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,880
ask what the hell is up with you people?

200
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Yeah, exactly.

201
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,280
What is up with, your media is really weird.

202
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,160
I mean, because heterosexuality, I mean, sometimes,

203
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,960
you know, people might frame heterosexuality

204
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,640
as like boring or vanilla or whatever.

205
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,320
I mean, heterosexuality is actually extremely complicated,

206
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,160
right?

207
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,560
And you notice this, like, and it's also

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,440
something that I think most queer people,

209
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,320
we, you know, we all kind of grew up

210
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,680
being taught how to do heterosexuality in a way, right?

211
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,320
So it's kind of the default that all of us are sort of used to.

212
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,880
And most, I think, a lot of gay people, even,

213
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,240
like, we kind of form our sexuality in response

214
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,920
to heterosexuality, in a sense, or sort of as a modification

215
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,000
of tropes that come from heterosexuality.

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,120
So I don't know whether you're taught.

217
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,720
Obviously, this all gets pretty controversial

218
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,320
with in-community stuff that we probably

219
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
don't want to get into here.

220
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,240
But, you know, with terms like top and bottom

221
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,880
and or butch and femme, like, these terms are not

222
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,400
the same as heterosexuality, right?

223
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,000
These dynamics are not literally heterosexuality,

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,080
but they obviously have some kind of resemblance

225
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,680
to the kind of tropes that we sort of expect

226
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,360
of a, you know, a kind of dominant active man

227
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,840
and sort of submissive, maybe passive woman.

228
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,400
That's kind of the stereotype of heterosexuality.

229
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,800
It certainly comes up a lot in romance fiction,

230
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,640
including Twilight.

231
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,760
So I felt like that was kind of an interesting place

232
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,160
to start with discussing sexuality as just like,

233
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,840
well, let's look at what's considered to be normal

234
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,920
and see how actually complicated and strange

235
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,240
the normal thing is.

236
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,840
Well, I found that fascinating because I am heterosexual,

237
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,480
or at least mostly heterosexual.

238
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,640
We're all a work in progress.

239
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,920
But, you know, heterosexuality, also all of those norms

240
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,000
and tropes were like imposed upon me.

241
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And sometimes, you know, I found myself,

242
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,560
especially in the part of life I am now going like,

243
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,520
wait, what are those things?

244
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,320
What, you know, are those part of me?

245
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,960
Or were those things that were imposed, right?

246
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,720
And so hearing you unpack desire, the nature of desire,

247
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,360
submission, dominance, masculinity, femininity

248
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,640
is incredibly fascinating.

249
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,400
You have this concept that you keep going back to DHSM

250
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,720
in the video over and over again.

251
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,360
Can you tell us a little bit about what you mean by that?

252
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,600
And for folks who haven't seen the video, go watch it.

253
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,240
But, you know, I'd love to give them a little bit of taste

254
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,480
of what the themes are here.

255
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,320
Sure, yeah.

256
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
DHSM is an acronym that I made up

257
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,880
for default heterosexual satomasticism.

258
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,560
I was thinking of like BDSM and then I'll just make a,

259
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,760
you know, corresponding acronym that describes what I see

260
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,360
as the kind of assumed satomasticism

261
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
of normative heterosexuality.

262
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,720
So, you know, we're all familiar with,

263
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,280
with like heterosexual dating rituals, basically,

264
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,160
where it's kind of expected that a man is going

265
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,440
to take initiative and that a man is going to be more dominant

266
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,040
is going to kind of, you know, lead in the dance of dating,

267
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,280
right, essentially, and also of sex.

268
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,040
And I think that there's a whole complicated series

269
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,520
of power dynamics baked into these assumptions,

270
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,360
where it's assumed that sort of, you know,

271
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,920
you could take things like voyeurism, exhibitionism.

272
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,640
It's assumed that men like to look

273
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,360
and women like to be looked at.

274
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,120
It's assumed that, you know, men pursue

275
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
and women are pursued.

276
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,920
All kinds of dynamics like that, you know,

277
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,760
in the video I have a whole list of these,

278
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,160
these binaries that basically are included.

279
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,080
But I guess one of the questions is like, well,

280
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,320
why is this, is this the, is this the project,

281
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,280
basically, of patriarchal conditioning?

282
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,560
Or is there something inherent to human sexuality itself

283
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,280
that involves these binaries?

284
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,560
And so all of that stuff that I try to explore.

285
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,240
And explore through the lens of Twilight,

286
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,280
where all of these things are present,

287
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,640
which is part of the controversy about Twilight, right?

288
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,840
That it's putatively for children,

289
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,360
or at least for young adults.

290
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,960
And yet it has these themes of dominant submission,

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
sadism, masochism, which feel like really inherently sexual

292
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,680
and confusing to a lot of people,

293
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,160
especially when it's like in the form

294
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,680
of very popular fiction.

295
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,680
And watching it, I literally just watched Twilight

296
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,080
last night, unrelatedly, it was not quite researched,

297
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,080
but it certainly served well as it.

298
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,720
And yeah, I mean, that stuff is in the movie

299
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,480
and in a very like stark, almost blunt way.

300
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
Yeah, I think it's interesting how,

301
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,200
because heterosexuality is considered so socially normal,

302
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,000
like you can get away with like a shocking amount

303
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,240
of like weird sex stuff in like young adult media,

304
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,840
as long as you keep it as you keep it hetero, right?

305
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,200
And Twilight definitely pushes that as far as it can.

306
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,360
Obviously, like there was a decade ago,

307
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,920
a controversy erupted around the Twilight fan fiction,

308
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,560
50 Shades of Grey, which is explicitly

309
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,760
a kind of sadomasochistic romance novel

310
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,120
where, I mean, what E.L. James, the author of 50 Shades did,

311
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,320
basically is just pick up on all those themes

312
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,640
that are already present in Twilight

313
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,720
and kind of make explicit what was implicit in Twilight.

314
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,680
So in Twilight, the plot is about a male vampire, Edward,

315
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,440
who falls in love with a human girl, Bella,

316
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,440
and obviously part of the kind of sex appeal of vampires

317
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,600
does have to do with this hierarchical dominance, right?

318
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,120
The vampire is usually old,

319
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,320
is usually there's undertones of violence

320
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,120
with the fangs and blood drinking.

321
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,920
Rich lives in a big castle, right?

322
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,240
Wearing cloaks everywhere, wealthy man.

323
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,400
Yeah, it's inherently associated with like,

324
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,520
there's a few working class vampires, Lost Boys,

325
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,800
but usually it's, we're talking about an aristocrat, right?

326
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,640
Yeah.

327
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,280
Someone who's sort of overwhelmingly powerful

328
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,600
and that seems to be intertwined with why people find

329
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,280
something sort of sexually enticing about vampires.

330
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,600
It is the danger and the power itself.

331
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,080
So the question is like, isn't it kind of disturbing, right?

332
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,000
That like, we have millions of teenage readers

333
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,520
who seem to be so attracted to this

334
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,320
and like, what kind of message is this sending?

335
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,040
Well, before we can even answer that,

336
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,120
you have to unpack why this kind of thing is appealing

337
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
to so many people in the first place.

338
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,480
And why do you think it's appealing

339
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,800
to so many people in the first place?

340
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,560
I think for a bunch of different reasons.

341
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,600
I definitely, I'm certainly not dismissive

342
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,320
of the feminist arguments about this,

343
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,880
which are that, you know, if you are a woman or a girl

344
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,160
and you're raised in this society,

345
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,360
where you're kind of conditioned almost to like romanticize

346
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,120
a certain type of dynamic between men and women,

347
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,880
that sort of is the result of a long history

348
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,080
of men having social power over women.

349
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,880
So even in historical romance novels,

350
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,240
like Pride and Prejudice, right?

351
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,920
In Pride and Prejudice, you have Darcy,

352
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,720
this like extremely wealthy man who's,

353
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,120
at first he's kind of an asshole,

354
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,720
and then Elizabeth who needs, you know,

355
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,200
because of the situation of her family, she needs the money,

356
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000
but she also wants a marriage of love.

357
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,080
And so in Pride and Prejudice, you know,

358
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,040
the appeal of this power dynamic seems to derive in part

359
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,240
from like the economics of the situation,

360
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,480
where it's like as a woman in the early 19th century,

361
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,160
you kind of have your economic fate

362
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,560
is intertwined with who you marry.

363
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,120
So it's not just, it's not,

364
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,680
it's hard to look at something like that

365
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,240
and be like, oh, this is just nature, right?

366
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,320
Women are just naturally attracted to powerful men.

367
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,400
It's like, well, women have always been put

368
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,000
in these situations where they kind of need men

369
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,960
to provide for them.

370
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,160
So yeah, under those conditions, obviously,

371
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,720
most women are going to do the rationally self-interested thing

372
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,840
of pursuing a man who is the only plausible route

373
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,840
that they have to economic stability

374
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,640
and to any kind of power, right?

375
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,680
But I also think that, you know,

376
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,320
the kind of SM, pseudo-masochistic dynamic

377
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
has something to it that kind of transcends

378
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,280
just the economic appeal, which is,

379
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,600
I think that there's something about sexuality,

380
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,360
about desire in general,

381
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,360
that kind of likes sort of barriers and overcoming,

382
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,480
you know, overcoming barriers.

383
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,480
So I think one thing that I think about a lot with Twilight

384
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,000
is, you know, when you have this like hunter and prey,

385
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,160
predator-prey dynamic, I think that, you know,

386
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,880
poetry is often described as love, as like a hunt, right?

387
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,320
And there's, you know, it's a motif

388
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,760
that goes like way back into the ancient world.

389
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,480
You know, you can think of myths like Hades and Persephone,

390
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,080
where, you know, you have, I think that when you,

391
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,440
desire often feels like pursuit, right?

392
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,440
And so I think that the metaphor goes kind of,

393
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,600
deeper than just economic imbalance.

394
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,680
I do think that the reason why it's so disproportionately

395
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,280
seems to be, you know, when people create romantic fantasies,

396
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,560
the reason why it's usually a man pursuing a woman,

397
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,600
I think that is largely social and economic,

398
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,240
but I think that someone pursuing someone,

399
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,440
that I think goes deeper, yeah.

400
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,960
Right, there's a deeper like pattern

401
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,520
in human sexuality or psychology or behavior

402
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,160
that needs some kind of disparity,

403
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,320
some kind of block in the way.

404
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,080
I mean, you talk in the video about how, you know,

405
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,480
desire, you can specifically only desire something

406
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,200
that you do not have, that once you acquire it,

407
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,120
the desire dissipates to some degree,

408
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,640
that that's the nature of it.

409
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,600
And so you need those impediments.

410
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,000
You also say that, I just wrote down this quote

411
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,640
from the video, equality like wisdom is not exciting.

412
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,680
That if Twilight had been a, there's a power dynamic,

413
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,360
oh no, we don't want power dynamics

414
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,120
in our real relationships, one might say.

415
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,520
But a perfectly equal relationship

416
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,680
between Edward and Bella would not be necessarily

417
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,760
worth writing a book about,

418
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,600
nor might it be sexy to encounter in real life,

419
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,120
like that sort of perfect, what do you,

420
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,200
could you expand on that?

421
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,440
Well, I think that you could certainly make,

422
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,480
you know, a egalitarian relationship exciting in fiction,

423
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,560
but the way that you do that was be to put

424
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,920
other kinds of barriers in the way.

425
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,600
So, I mean, I guess you, you look at something

426
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,920
like Romeo and Juliet was an obvious example

427
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,200
where Romeo and Juliet are, I guess,

428
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,320
more or less socially equal, although, you know,

429
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,240
as like medieval man and woman, not really,

430
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,040
but still like there's not quite the class element

431
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,800
that there is in, say, Pride and Prejudice or in Twilight,

432
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,480
but as a result of that, other barriers

433
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,400
have to be involved, right?

434
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,640
Their families are feuding and that as this dangerous,

435
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,960
almost like in this case, deadly element to their romance,

436
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,480
right, is that they are kind of risking everything

437
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,880
for each other.

438
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,720
There's different ways, I think,

439
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,120
for an artist to accomplish that,

440
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,320
but people do seem to find the danger of it exciting, right?

441
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,840
And you can, and you can create that through

442
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,880
the kind of vampire hierarchy, whereas like one person

443
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,680
is sort of overwhelmingly dangerous to the other person,

444
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,000
or you can create it through like social circumstances

445
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,760
where for whatever reason, this romance is forbidden, right?

446
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,600
But speaking more generally about equality,

447
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,640
yeah, I do think that, you know, even outside of fantasy,

448
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,720
if you look at like role play

449
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,000
and the kinds of like scenarios that, you know,

450
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,200
if you look at like the fan fiction people, right,

451
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,800
or erotica, like it's very common

452
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,640
to have situations of power imbalance.

453
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,080
So I think that, I don't think it's impossible

454
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,640
to make equality sexy, but I think that for a lot of people,

455
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,700
a kind of fantasy scenario gets more exciting

456
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,260
with the addition of some kind of power play.

457
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,020
Right, and the nature of fantasy and sexual fantasy

458
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,060
is something that you go into a great deal of detail

459
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,260
about, you have a lot of insight into,

460
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,620
that fantasy is some way of like licensing ourselves

461
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,460
to enjoy that thing while, can you complete my thought?

462
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,100
Yeah, I think that human sexuality

463
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,740
needs fantasy to function, like I think that we all,

464
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,980
well, I don't want to over generalize,

465
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,940
but I think that for most people,

466
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,740
they don't experience, I don't know, sexuality

467
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,380
as this kind of purely animalistic thing, right?

468
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,780
It's usually sustained by some kind of fantasy content,

469
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,820
you know, whether that's, I mean,

470
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,900
I think the best way to encounter a lot of this

471
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,500
is just to read a lot of like erotic fan fiction,

472
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,900
for example, or to like, I don't know,

473
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,700
I mean, you can also like, you know,

474
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,420
if you have the stomach for it,

475
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,100
you can look at pornography and, you know,

476
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,540
I mean, it's the variety of situations

477
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,780
that people can caught in their fantasies.

478
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,140
I feel like speaks to something in human sexuality

479
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,140
that kind of needs something more than just sex, right?

480
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,580
Sex, sexuality is more than just sex.

481
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,140
Even the bluntest, you know, porn hub video,

482
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,020
that's just a video of two people going at it,

483
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,060
at least the title will be like, you know,

484
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,660
stepmother, blah, blah, blah, there's a scenario,

485
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,860
like in the title of the video,

486
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,100
at least to just like give you a frame

487
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,780
of who these people are to each other,

488
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,380
what they might have in common, and, you know,

489
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,580
that might draw one person to the video more than another,

490
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,900
depending on what you're into.

491
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,540
And there has to be a reason for that, right?

492
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,780
Like, I think if people,

493
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,540
they wouldn't be, they wouldn't be so many stepbrothers

494
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,140
in pornography if it wasn't appealing to people

495
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,980
for some reason, right?

496
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,540
That is generating clicks.

497
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,540
Why is that?

498
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,460
Well, I mean, we can analyze why.

499
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,060
I don't think it's because, I don't think it is

500
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,320
because most people have like some kind of secret,

501
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,020
unconscious longing for incest.

502
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,860
I don't think that's why.

503
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,860
I think the taboo is being used in this case,

504
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,660
where incest is a taboo, is being used,

505
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,980
although it's kind of hedged with the like step thing, right?

506
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,140
To, you know, we don't want to go too far,

507
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,940
but like this element of like taboo is another factor

508
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,620
that kind of increases the excitement

509
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,300
by putting an additional barrier, right?

510
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,740
Where like social norms are being shattered

511
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,060
and desires in some way like pushing through the norm,

512
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,980
and that element of like overcoming a barrier

513
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,660
always seems to be what's exciting.

514
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,500
And I think that goes back to like this idea

515
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,780
that desire is lack or that you want what you don't have

516
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,340
or want what you're not supposed to be able to have.

517
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,460
You know, in a way, it's like the harder you have to,

518
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,460
the more obstacles you have to overcome

519
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,460
to get what you want in a way the more you want it

520
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,740
or the more exciting that it seems, yeah.

521
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,220
You also talk about fantasy.

522
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,060
This is the most interesting part to me

523
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:14,060
as being a way of, okay, so people say about Twilight a lot.

524
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,940
Why is this the fantasy?

525
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,540
This is a dangerous situation for, you know,

526
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,980
Bella to want someone who might want to kill her

527
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,980
or hurt her and is barely holding back.

528
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,180
Isn't that frightening?

529
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,300
But you talk about fantasy as being a way

530
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,300
of almost creating a safe place for the female character

531
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,820
to enjoy a certain type of desire

532
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,380
that would otherwise be dangerous.

533
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,740
I might be mutilating the point.

534
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,500
Could you, you know what I'm talking about?

535
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,740
Yeah, well, I think that, you know,

536
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,460
look at the kinds of media that people consume all the time.

537
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,020
Like the popularity of movies about the apocalypse

538
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,100
or about, you know, all kinds of horrible things happening.

539
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,460
People like to experience things in fantasy,

540
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,700
in art, in general,

541
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,660
that obviously we don't want to experience in reality.

542
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,860
Yeah, we crave the apocalypse

543
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,580
even though we don't want to live within it.

544
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,460
Most of us do not want the apocalypse to happen,

545
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,700
but there's, you know,

546
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
there's something that just is endlessly fascinating

547
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,100
to people about watching a movie

548
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,740
where like New York City is destroyed.

549
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,660
We just, we're obsessed

550
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,860
because we just want to see it again and again.

551
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,620
And that's not, I don't think

552
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,260
because we actually want New York City to be destroyed, right?

553
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,460
It's because there's, I don't know,

554
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,220
there's some, there's some part of it

555
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,460
that's part of us that's sort of fascinated

556
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,500
with at least the idea of destruction, right?

557
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,340
Yeah.

558
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,540
And or like the fantasy of it, even though we, you know,

559
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,580
and I think for mentally stable people,

560
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,660
those two things are securely separated.

561
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,740
You know, I do think that there's like a validity

562
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,300
to the objection that, you know,

563
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,580
people who worry about media like Twilight

564
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,780
being so popular or normal among teenagers, you know,

565
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,700
do teenagers have the media skills is the question, right?

566
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,460
To understand, okay, like this is not

567
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,540
depicting an actual relationship, right?

568
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,580
Like this is not depicting an ideal.

569
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,140
Like we don't, we don't want a real relationship

570
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,620
with a vampire that that's not, that's, you know,

571
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,620
this type of relationship is disastrous.

572
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,100
If you're actually in a relationship

573
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,420
with someone who wants to, you know, drink your blood

574
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,500
or who wants to kill you or whatever, that's, you know,

575
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,100
that's a catastrophe if it actually happens.

576
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,220
But in fantasy, again, these things kind of become exciting

577
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,180
and the danger as to the excitement.

578
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,540
But, and I think that most readers of these things know that,

579
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,380
right?

580
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,300
I think most readers of dark romance novels are aware

581
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,700
that what they're not, they're not consuming content

582
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,500
that's like, ooh, this is a blueprint

583
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,700
for how to live your life.

584
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,460
Like most people know that when,

585
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,060
when you read escapist fantasy, you're not,

586
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,700
you don't actually want that to happen.

587
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,100
But of course, you know, you can't always point to

588
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,860
some people who don't have, who, who aren't so good

589
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,820
at making those distinctions between fantasy

590
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,660
and what they really want.

591
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,540
But I do think that it's unfair to malign the fantasy itself

592
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,540
because some people are sort of don't have like a good grip

593
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,580
on the difference between fantasy and reality.

594
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,140
Yeah, we all engage in fantasy.

595
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,180
And yet, because it's a human thing to do.

596
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,700
And yet there's this constant push to criticize the fantasies

597
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,980
that other people have as being harmful

598
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,580
while engaging in our own.

599
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,540
Yeah, absolutely.

600
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,100
And I mean, that's one reason why you have, you know,

601
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,420
so slogans like, don't yuck my yum

602
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,180
or like the discourse about kink shaming.

603
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,780
I mean, obviously these that, you know,

604
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,540
that those kinds of slogans are relative

605
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,020
to a particular context where, you know,

606
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,380
you've, you've agreed on in advance that, okay,

607
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,340
this is a space where we're, where we're going

608
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,740
to openly discuss sexuality.

609
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,020
And, and so like within certain reasonable limits,

610
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,300
I think we, you know, you say like, we appreciate

611
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,060
that people have like a very diverse range of, you know,

612
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,060
turn-ons basically, right?

613
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,900
And so what other, what someone else might be into

614
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,620
might seem like completely disgusting to you,

615
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,340
but like, yeah, that's just, that's just how it is.

616
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,140
Like, I don't know, the humans are very diverse.

617
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,580
And human sexuality is like,

618
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,540
is that kind of amazingly diverse in a way?

619
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,900
Because the sense, obviously this is something that does

620
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,900
at some point have some kind of biological evolutionary

621
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,740
history, but the psychology of it has, is like,

622
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,860
well, is a significantly more complicated

623
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,340
than biological function.

624
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,740
Yeah, and a big theme in the video is

625
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,860
how our sexuality is more flexible or more, you know,

626
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,740
less determined biologically than a lot of people think.

627
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,900
You're pushing back against the idea

628
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,660
of default heterosexual sadomasochism.

629
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,260
A point that really spoke to me was,

630
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,060
you noted how a lot of men who are, you know,

631
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
socialized to be dominant or to, you know,

632
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,980
to be the Edward in the situation, right?

633
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,460
And to pursue and to be the desirer

634
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,700
have like a latent wish to be desired.

635
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,140
And I'll just say I related to this.

636
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,220
I was like, you know, a little ping went off in my head.

637
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
Ah, yes, I have felt that way

638
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,780
and never quite had language for it,

639
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,300
which I think is a wonderful thing

640
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,820
that media like yours can do.

641
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,420
Can you talk a little bit more about that idea

642
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,140
and where that came from?

643
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,260
Yeah, this is something I've heard

644
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,740
from a lot of individual men.

645
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,580
I mean, I also think that when I'm doing research

646
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,340
on videos like this, I will kind of browse

647
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,380
across social media in search of relevant discussions.

648
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,180
And I remember one time, I think it was like

649
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,220
the ask men subreddit, someone asked something

650
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,820
along the lines of, you know, what is one thing

651
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,180
that you want from relationships with women

652
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,620
that you feel like you don't often get?

653
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,700
And I think the most upvoted response to that question

654
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,220
was I want to feel like I am desired.

655
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,540
So I think that, you know, I think that both men

656
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,260
and women are in a way not served well

657
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,700
by being forced to conform to a default

658
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,580
heterosexual sadomasochism where it's only the man

659
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,060
who's supposed to desire and the woman only

660
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,820
is supposed to want to be desired.

661
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,900
I think that puts people in boxes

662
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,780
where there's certain desires that don't get acknowledged

663
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,620
or met.

664
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,540
And as you say, often people don't have the words for it.

665
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,140
So I think that a woman who kind of wants to that more

666
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,140
like, quote unquote, virile, like pursuing a desiring rule,

667
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,260
you know, we'll feel like she, there's something sort

668
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,340
of masculine about inherent to that

669
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,100
or something even sort of shamefully unfeminine about it.

670
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,260
And likewise, I think that men are put in this situation

671
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,940
where they, because they need to be the dominant

672
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,620
active pursuers, there's part of them

673
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,220
that maybe wants to be, you know, that you,

674
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,500
you want to be pursued, right?

675
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,460
You want to also feel that, you know,

676
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,420
someone you're attracted to is attracted to you

677
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,900
and will is kind of active in that.

678
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
And it's not just like a passive participant

679
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,540
for you to do things too, right?

680
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,140
Like I think that, but I think that, you know,

681
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,980
there's often some, there's often a kind of shame

682
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,100
that comes with that where I think it, you know,

683
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,740
it's sort of, it feels unmanly maybe.

684
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,500
I think even to kind of want to be wanted.

685
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,660
But there are times that, you know,

686
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,340
I think you have some examples of this.

687
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,340
If you look through the behaviors of actual men

688
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,820
in real life, you know, they will betray that desire

689
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,660
or there's certain features of masculine,

690
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,060
well, I mean, you saw it for yourself on a Reddit page.

691
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,180
These things are real and an acknowledgement

692
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,340
of them can lead to a more functional sexuality.

693
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,620
I mean, you, you had a, what's the word?

694
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,540
It's not variability, something like that.

695
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,460
Flexibility that you say, maybe rather than equality,

696
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,380
we can strive for, what is the word you use?

697
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,220
Versatility.

698
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,620
Versatility, thank you.

699
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,900
Just talk about that a little bit.

700
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,420
Well, I guess, I mean, the word comes from,

701
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,340
from gay culture where, you know,

702
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,540
people will use terms like top and bottom

703
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,220
or, you know, Dom and sub.

704
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,580
And then the word verse means that you are someone

705
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,660
who's interested in, or who likes,

706
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,740
basically occupying either role.

707
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,020
So verse, just sort of for versatile.

708
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,940
But I think like most straight people do not use terms

709
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,540
like top and bottom and, you know,

710
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,180
there's a question of whether straight people should use them

711
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,620
because it's something that comes from gay culture.

712
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,460
But I do think that most people,

713
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,180
gay or straight or bi or whatever you are,

714
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,260
like would benefit from this concept,

715
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,780
from being a little bit more open to versatility

716
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,900
and relationships and in sexuality.

717
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,780
I think that, I think a lot of people have like, you know,

718
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,260
by putting themselves in one box or the other,

719
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,540
kind of are closing off some part of their own desire.

720
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,380
And it's something that you kind of discover

721
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,180
by opening yourself up to it.

722
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,580
Whereas I think most people tend to, you know,

723
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,460
all of us are kind of on some level,

724
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,720
the products of the social conditioning.

725
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,060
And so there's a implicit value, I think,

726
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,620
placed on a man being active or a woman being passive

727
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,300
or a man being the one who desires,

728
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,660
a woman who's sort of being desirable.

729
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,180
And I think that for most people,

730
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,620
if you want to get outside of those boxes,

731
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,460
it involves navigating a certain level of shame

732
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,380
and overcome and also like conceptually the confusion

733
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,940
that comes with what I'm calling default,

734
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,700
heterosexual masculinity, right?

735
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,060
Where I think so many, this idea is like so deep

736
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,020
that a lot of people think that what it is to be masculine

737
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:23,660
or to be male even is to be active and to be, right?

738
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,420
It's often like assumed to map on to anatomy in some way,

739
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,260
right?

740
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,540
That it's just assumed that like a male sexual role is active

741
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,980
and a female sexual role is passive.

742
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,820
But I don't think that's,

743
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,100
I don't think that's psychologically the case.

744
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,460
And I think that it comes across in things like,

745
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,900
well, even if you just like look at like,

746
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,820
manosphere like incel culture, for example,

747
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,580
a lot of these, you know, so if you read incel forms,

748
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,740
they get really upset when someone suggests

749
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,180
like just hire a sex worker.

750
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,220
Well, they don't want to do that.

751
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,420
They don't want to hire a sex worker.

752
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,260
Why?

753
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,900
Because it's not really just about sex for them.

754
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,700
They haven't really analyzed this maybe,

755
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,660
but they want a woman to want them, right?

756
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,980
They don't want to pay for it, right?

757
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,140
They don't want this transaction because,

758
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,460
because, you know, and maybe they feel like

759
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,100
they can't say that and they don't know how to say it,

760
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,500
but it's like, they want to feel desirable

761
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,020
and that's something that they're sort of

762
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,780
almost confused about, it seems.

763
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,980
And likewise with, you know, romance novels,

764
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,780
a very feminine genre, you know, a lot of romance novels

765
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,620
are written with a very strong male perspective in them.

766
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,220
And one thing that I kind of speculate about

767
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,340
is I do think that a lot of women read romance novels

768
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,860
and identify with the man, right?

769
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,740
So, I mean, for example, and you know,

770
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,900
Twilight, Stephanie Meyer has rewritten

771
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,540
in this 2020 book, Midnight Sun,

772
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,020
which is just the Twilight story,

773
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,060
but told from Edward's perspective.

774
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,300
It's common in mainstream romance novels,

775
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,100
even for the male's perspective to be included,

776
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,460
I think because women have the kind of versatility,

777
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,940
a lot of female readers have like the versatility of that,

778
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,780
right?

779
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,620
They like being able to identify

780
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,300
with either side of this dynamic.

781
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,980
Yeah, and I mean, that's in Twilight a little bit itself

782
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,900
that, you know, Edward has some,

783
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,860
I think you would call,

784
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,780
typically feminine qualities.

785
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,580
That's what, you know, a lot of teenage boys

786
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,700
were pissed about when the book came out that like,

787
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,340
oh, he's kind of like a feminized vampire in some way.

788
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,460
There's parts where Bella becomes a vampire,

789
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,420
becomes stronger than him and maybe dominates him

790
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,980
a little bit, like it's almost modeling

791
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,620
a healthy, versatile like switch that they're able to do.

792
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,140
Is that the case?

793
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,620
Well, I think that if by the end of the series, right,

794
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,180
that the dynamic between them does kind of equalize,

795
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,220
which I do think is another thing that people do tend

796
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,620
to neglect when they discuss this story,

797
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,740
is that it starts out with this massive power imbalance.

798
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,660
But by the end of the series,

799
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,620
Bella has also become a vampire

800
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,380
and she's kind of like risen to Edward's level

801
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,140
and their dynamic is much more equal.

802
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,420
And that's pretty explicitly something that's explored

803
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,980
and breaking down at the last of those novels.

804
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,460
Yeah, and even in the first film,

805
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,380
which is the only one that I've seen, you know,

806
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,420
yes, there's a dominant and submissive relationship

807
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,220
to some degree, but also, you know,

808
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,580
Edward is like almost driven mad by his desire.

809
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,380
He can't stay away and I'm watching it going like,

810
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,140
Bella doesn't feel like unpowerful.

811
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,060
She feels like she has, you know,

812
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,220
there is a power in the being chased, right?

813
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,780
In being desired, like every single time

814
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,460
one of these ideas arises,

815
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,340
the opposite is buried just under the surface,

816
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,660
like ready to come out and flip over in some way.

817
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,220
And that sort of leads me to the end of the video.

818
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,140
I think one of the most powerful ideas

819
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,660
that when you got to this point, again,

820
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,180
I was like, how did we get here in a video about Twilight?

821
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,980
The idea that, you know, we do not have a,

822
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,300
I'm gonna mangle again what you said,

823
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,940
but, you know, we do not have a gender binary,

824
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,180
we have a gender yin yang,

825
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,500
where the masculine and feminine are counterparts

826
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,860
and contain each other

827
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,700
and are constantly undermining or replacing each other

828
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,580
and that containing each other and nested, nested levels.

829
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,460
How did you come to that idea?

830
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,300
Was that through the examination of Twilight?

831
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,020
Or was that an idea that you had had before

832
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,380
that you expressed via Twilight?

833
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,620
Well, I like the idea that this was some like deep truth

834
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,780
that I discovered by reading Twilight.

835
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,540
In reality, no, I don't think that was exactly how it happened.

836
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,460
But yeah, I was actually thinking about the concept

837
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,460
of yin yang and I like this kind of as a more,

838
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,820
what I think is a deeper way of thinking about

839
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,940
what people often think of as a binary.

840
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,140
So a binary is just one and zero,

841
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:38,420
but oftentimes binaries like masculine and feminine,

842
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,740
that they sort of are mutually constitutive, right?

843
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,420
Where like part of what it means to be,

844
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,100
you can't really understand what we mean by masculinity

845
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,220
unless it's complimented by this concept of femininity.

846
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,180
And I think that when you appreciate that,

847
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,500
you also kind of see the transformative capacity

848
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,860
that exists in this where, you know,

849
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,820
there is something feminine about the masculine

850
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,820
and there's something masculine about the feminine.

851
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,220
And one person is not just masculine or feminine.

852
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,820
I think that, you know, we all have these sides to ourself

853
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,300
and over time these can change

854
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,900
and one or the other can be more dominant

855
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,340
at different times.

856
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,540
At least that's how I think about,

857
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,900
that's how I think about masculinity and femininity,

858
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,700
not as like, oh, either you're masculine or you're feminine

859
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,620
and that's like an essential thing about yourself.

860
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,340
Like, no, I think we each contain the whole dynamic

861
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,780
in a way.

862
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,620
So I think that that is something that,

863
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,740
I mean, you don't have to explore this through Twilight,

864
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,580
but I think that it's something

865
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,140
that Twilight does ultimately explore.

866
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,660
And not just Twilight, I mean, often romance novels,

867
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,580
you know, they get a lot of criticism

868
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,820
for being sort of, you know, masochistic,

869
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,940
that is for having disempowered female protagonists,

870
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,380
which a lot of them do,

871
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,380
but a lot of those disempowered female protagonists

872
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,980
also kind of end the novel powerful.

873
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,500
And so I think in a way, the inequality,

874
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,420
you know, I mean, it's complicated,

875
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,460
where you could argue that the inequality

876
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,900
is being romanticized and often it is,

877
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,860
but also a lot of times the inequality

878
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,460
is there as an obstacle to be overcome, right?

879
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,140
The inequality is the driver of a conflict

880
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,660
where the end of the fantasy,

881
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,380
like the consummation of the fantasy

882
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,140
is in a way overcoming the inequality

883
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,220
and, you know, achieving an equal relationship.

884
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,500
Right, the separation ending,

885
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,900
the separation of desire ending and the becoming one,

886
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,860
which brings us back to the yin-yang.

887
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,660
And it's also a, I see how this works in sex, right?

888
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,940
That if you are beginning in a masculine way,

889
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,340
but there's the seeds of femininity within, right?

890
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,740
And when that comes out, that is a sexy reversal, right?

891
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,420
It makes me think a little bit in,

892
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,740
this is a very strange comparison,

893
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,020
but in comedy writing,

894
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,780
something that we do a lot is hiring and lowering.

895
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,380
You know, you want to see the low become high

896
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,220
and the high become low.

897
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,940
The Lord becomes the peasant,

898
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,300
the dog starts walking around and giving orders, you know,

899
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,980
like the dog and family guy or whatever, right?

900
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,420
It's fun to see the flip

901
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,660
and you wanna see it happen over and over, right?

902
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,980
You wanna see in trading places,

903
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,580
you wanna see them go up and down and down and up.

904
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,260
It's the transition between the two that is enjoyable.

905
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,380
It's not like the static nature of staying in one place,

906
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,660
which I don't know, that's life, right?

907
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,340
That's what is fulfilling,

908
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,660
is to experience that going back and forth.

909
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,300
I think there's so many odd connections

910
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,220
between comedy and sexuality.

911
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,700
There's, I like what you're saying about like high and low,

912
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,020
sort of, you know, becoming each other.

913
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,140
There's also the tension and release theme

914
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,740
that I think I talk about a bit in the Twilight video.

915
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,580
And obviously this is the thing that comics

916
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,420
will talk about, right?

917
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,380
You know, building tension,

918
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,900
a joke often starts by building tension

919
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,220
and then a punchline will be a release of that tension

920
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,620
and the audience laughs.

921
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,820
I mean, I think sexuality works that way too.

922
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,380
The reason our romance novel usually has a kind of,

923
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,460
I mean, there's a reason people like

924
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,260
the historical romance novel, right?

925
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,740
And part of it has to do with tension.

926
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,500
There's more tension in historical romance,

927
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,180
oftentimes because of the barriers

928
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,960
that that setting involves, right?

929
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,900
Everyone's wearing so many clothes.

930
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,460
I mean, to be very literal about it,

931
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,660
but also there's all, there's like social,

932
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,300
there's social, it's not just the bodice,

933
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,900
it's the social bodice, right?

934
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,060
There's rules about who can have a romantic relationship

935
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,300
with whom and those rules create a kind of,

936
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,380
they add to the tension between characters.

937
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,140
As the sort of stakes are higher,

938
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,940
there's more that's key,

939
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,860
the situation is high, strong, right?

940
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,860
It's tense and that I think people find sexy,

941
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,140
obviously hoping that eventually the tension is released,

942
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,620
but in a way that it just kind of similar to a joke.

943
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,420
Yeah, I mean, I love how comedy is similar

944
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,980
to other genres, I have to think about comedy

945
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,380
is similar to horror in a lot of ways.

946
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,740
I've never considered how it's similar to romance,

947
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,740
but it really is, that's so funny and surprising to me.

948
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,100
Folks, did you know that learning actually makes a sound?

949
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,260
It's true, listen to this.

950
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,700
That is the sound of you learning a new language with Babbel.

951
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,620
Learning a new language can be one of the toughest,

952
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,860
yet most rewarding challenges out there.

953
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,640
So if you are ready to dive in,

954
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,480
make sure you are using the right tools

955
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,800
to get the job done.

956
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,640
See, Babbel isn't just a game masquerading

957
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,280
as a learning app, it is crafted by real people

958
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,080
for real conversations.

959
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,880
With Babbel, you get tips and tools

960
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,560
that are approachable and rooted in real life situations,

961
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,920
delivered through conversation-based teaching.

962
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,320
This means that you'll be ready to put

963
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,760
what you have learned into practice in the real world.

964
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,600
And let me tell you something,

965
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,000
the real world is where you want to put the language

966
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,120
you learned through Babbel into use.

967
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,280
I live in Los Angeles,

968
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,880
a huge number of my fellow Angelenos speak Spanish,

969
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,640
and that means because I am studying Spanish with Babbel,

970
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,040
I can actually improve my daily life

971
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,880
and the communication with people around me.

972
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,360
It has really enriched my experience of the city I live in

973
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,640
because now words that used to mean nothing to me

974
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,320
mean something, I can speak to people,

975
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,480
I wasn't able to before, even just a little bit,

976
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,080
it really makes a big difference.

977
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,920
But you know what?

978
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,560
You don't have to take my word for it.

979
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,800
Studies from Yale, Michigan State University,

980
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,280
and others show that Babbel is effective.

981
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,440
One study even found that using Babbel for 15 hours

982
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,880
is equivalent to a full semester of college.

983
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,440
And look, I can't promise that it'll be easy,

984
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,080
but you'll be glad you did it.

985
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,920
And guess what?

986
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,740

992
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,760
rules and restrictions may apply.

993
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,800
You also come to this point though,

994
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,320
about human sexuality, I think it's so beautiful.

995
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:58,320
You're talking about, again, SNM and fantasy and desire,

996
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
but you come to this point about masculine and feminine

997
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,160
containing each other.

998
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,520
And one of the things I love that you say is,

999
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,640
someone who is a masculine acting man or a trans person

1000
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,560
is not appropriating someone else's sexuality.

1001
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,680
Masculinity and femininity are like,

1002
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,080
we all have them as humans.

1003
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,680
We are all, and they're all our, you don't say birthright,

1004
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,720
but they're all something that we are entitled to

1005
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,360
by virtue of our humanity.

1006
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,000
And that's such a, I don't know,

1007
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,720
that's such a powerful point that spirals off

1008
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,480
in so many other directions, philosophical, political,

1009
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,680
and to get there from this place

1010
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,360
where you're talking about SNM and Twilight

1011
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,760
is fascinating to me.

1012
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,200
Yeah, I think that, I mean,

1013
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,280
people will often say, oh, genders differ from race,

1014
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,960
but then without really specifying what that difference is.

1015
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,680
I mean, I think one of them has to do with the fact that,

1016
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,760
you know, gender exists in some form

1017
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,120
in pretty much every human society that I'm aware of.

1018
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,480
I guess, you know, I think gender does,

1019
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,680
in some ancestral way, of course,

1020
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,680
derive from the kind of generally dimorphic reproductive roles,

1021
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,440
but obviously there's a lot more to gender than that.

1022
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,760
And in a lot of ways, gender has become,

1023
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,560
and for a long time, you know, quite unhinged,

1024
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,600
I think, from directly being about reproduction.

1025
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,600
But I think that, you know, unlike race or ethnicity,

1026
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,400
like within every human family, there is a man and a woman.

1027
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,080
Well, actually, not every human family, right?

1028
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,880
We can...

1029
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,160
Of course.

1030
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,000
But again, I think that the origin of,

1031
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,080
most people have a mother and a father,

1032
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,920
and I think that's the sort of origin of a lot of ideas

1033
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,960
about masculinity and femininity.

1034
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,280
And I think that no one person is like,

1035
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,080
you know, just the result of,

1036
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,440
I mean, I guess, I don't know,

1037
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,480
I guess there's probably some like monk somewhere

1038
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,840
who has never met a woman, but I don't know.

1039
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,280
I do feel that most people contain

1040
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,920
some masculine and feminine element.

1041
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,880
And I think that to me,

1042
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,440
I see some level of androgyny as being,

1043
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,600
I mean, I guess I'm kind of getting this

1044
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,640
from Virginia Woolf, right?

1045
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,960
Who says like, oh, a great writer is always androgynous,

1046
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,800
right?

1047
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,320
And the idea seeming to be that like,

1048
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,560
to kind of fully perfect yourself as an artist,

1049
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,560
you need to be in touch with both the masculine

1050
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,080
and the feminine within yourself.

1051
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,360
And, you know, if things get too unbalanced,

1052
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,840
it leads to problems.

1053
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,360
So I think that that applies not just to art,

1054
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,800
but also kind of to sexuality,

1055
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,640
where I guess I've tried it at times

1056
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,560
to force myself into one box or another.

1057
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,760
I've tried to be, you know,

1058
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,200
to make myself more masculine

1059
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,440
or try to conform to like a very strict idea of femininity.

1060
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,000
And neither of those has ever worked for me.

1061
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,040
So maybe this is just me, you know,

1062
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,360
in a way, philosophy is autobiography.

1063
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,880
In a way, maybe this is me just working

1064
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,840
for my own personal thing

1065
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,240
and then making sweeping generalizations about human nature.

1066
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,400
Well, lots of people do that.

1067
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,200
So I guess, you know, guilty.

1068
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,800
But I think it's, you know,

1069
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,080
there's sweeping generalizations

1070
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,960
that other people seem to relate to.

1071
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,480
So I think it's probably not just me

1072
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,800
that finds that only being strictly masculine

1073
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,560
or strictly feminine doesn't really,

1074
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,000
hasn't really worked out well for me.

1075
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,800
And I think it probably doesn't work out well

1076
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,040
for a lot of people.

1077
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,240
Yeah, I've often felt that in my own life,

1078
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,600
that that's a box that I was placed in

1079
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,840
and I have a constant sort of desire to undermine it

1080
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,440
or to find, you know, more richness in it

1081
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,160
or to find what I'm missing.

1082
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,720
And I think that's probably part of why this

1083
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,360
was a popular video is because it expresses that.

1084
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,720
You said philosophy, I want to talk more

1085
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,280
about how you think about this video

1086
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,320
as a work of philosophy.

1087
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,040
I mean, at one point, I believe there's a graphic

1088
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,680
on the screen that says, or maybe you say this out loud,

1089
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,000
that you made this video

1090
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,960
instead of writing a PhD dissertation.

1091
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,280
And at that moment, I realized, wait, this, yeah,

1092
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,720
that is this dense of a philosophical work.

1093
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,800
There is that many citation of other thinkers.

1094
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,200
You're doing that much original thinking.

1095
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,080
I mean, there's a huge number of videos

1096
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,400
that are, you know, philosophy videos on YouTube

1097
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,600
that are just summarizing.

1098
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,520
And that's wonderful for them to summarize.

1099
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,360
That's essentially what I feel I do as a comic.

1100
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,960
I read a bunch of ideas and I summarize them for you

1101
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,600
in a way that is funny and intelligible.

1102
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
I make it go down easy.

1103
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,120
And hopefully I get a couple of my own ideas in there too,

1104
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,640
because I'm a smart person and I like to think I am.

1105
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,960
And I have my own thoughts about the world.

1106
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,560
But I mean, at the end of this video,

1107
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,600
I was like, put this in a fucking library somewhere

1108
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,120
because people need to like keep watching it

1109
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,960
and understanding exactly what point you're making

1110
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,240
and put it into dialogue with other philosophers

1111
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,440
or psychologists or thinkers.

1112
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,320
I mean, how do you think about the work in that way?

1113
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,600
Well, I think unlike, I mean, this video,

1114
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,160
more than my other videos was like,

1115
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,960
I did so much research for this.

1116
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,800
I think I read at least 100 books for this.

1117
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,760
And then it also like a lot of articles and things.

1118
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,400
And so I tried to get like very familiar

1119
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,360
with like a wide range of thinking

1120
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,520
about the topics that I wanted to cover

1121
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,640
and use that to build what's basically a three hour argument

1122
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,320
of what I wanted to say.

1123
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,360
So that I think is more academic

1124
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,880
than most of the stuff I do on YouTube

1125
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,960
in the sense that the citations are very wide

1126
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,400
and there's a lot of them.

1127
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,280
But also, yeah, I am trying to make an argument

1128
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,240
that I think is my own argument.

1129
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,280
And then the citations are just sort of ways

1130
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,960
of like bringing in other people's ideas.

1131
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,400
You know, it's always tricky with a video essay.

1132
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,400
You wanna balance like the kind of academic side

1133
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,920
with the entertainment side.

1134
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,640
You can't just sit in front of a camera

1135
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,600
and like read your, you know, master's thesis or whatever.

1136
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,800
Because I think people will find that boring.

1137
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,120
But, you know, the hope anyway with this video

1138
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,640
was that I was gonna be able to balance

1139
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,920
what are my sincere ideas in my academic reading?

1140
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,680
I'm hoping that I presented this in a way

1141
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,560
that was not just kind of for an academic audience

1142
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,440
but would be for a popular audience.

1143
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,920
And people have watched the videos, I guess,

1144
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,960
on some level that has succeeded.

1145
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,680
I know you left the world of academia years ago

1146
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,760
after spending some time there.

1147
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,800
But it really struck me with this video

1148
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,320
that you are doing work that one would strive to do

1149
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,320
in an academic setting.

1150
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,600
I have to imagine that there are people, you know,

1151
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,320
in grad school or philosophy professors themselves

1152
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,280
who are thinking, my God, I wish my ideas, you know,

1153
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,920
we're able to get 3.7 million views on YouTube.

1154
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,920
Are you, is that a world that you still want to interact with

1155
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,160
or that you hope this video interacts with?

1156
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,520
Have you had outreach from, you know,

1157
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,480
people who are working on similar ideas and issues

1158
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,360
in the world of the Academy?

1159
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,400
I have, yeah.

1160
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,480
And I, it's been long enough now that I do sometimes miss

1161
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,200
the academic context.

1162
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,480
I mean, I think I kind of overdosed on it a bit

1163
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,320
when I was in my 20s.

1164
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,240
Like, I, you know, getting a, I got half of a philosophy,

1165
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,760
PhD, basically, and ended up quitting with a master's

1166
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,640
before writing a dissertation.

1167
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,880
But I think that I kind of coasted for a few years

1168
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,720
afterwards.

1169
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,800
I was like, well, I've basically spent most of my 20s

1170
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,960
with my face in a book.

1171
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,080
So now, you know, I want to like say things with that

1172
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,760
to an actual audience.

1173
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,840
And I felt that I found the audience on YouTube.

1174
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,400
But I think a few years ago, I started worrying.

1175
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,520
I was like, it's been years now since I was in,

1176
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,200
since I was taking classes or going to seminars,

1177
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,680
getting feedback from professors.

1178
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,720
I sort of started to worry.

1179
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,880
I was like, I'm going to get some,

1180
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,520
I'm going to start getting sloppy and boring.

1181
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,720
In a sense, if I don't, well, not boring,

1182
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,000
but I guess I worried that I was going to get a little too

1183
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,440
detached from that like research foundation.

1184
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,920
So I, with this project, I really wanted to make myself

1185
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,720
like go back to school in a way.

1186
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,160
And so I read a lot of like pretty dense texts

1187
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,160
from psychoanalysis to feminist theory to, you know,

1188
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
kind of a wide source of commentary on sexuality

1189
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,640
or on gender.

1190
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,640
So I tried to kind of bolster the substance of this video

1191
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,640
by using academic texts again.

1192
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,440
And that's such a, it's such a project to do that.

1193
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,080
Like as somebody who builds arguments myself

1194
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,960
and my own work done so on TV, I do so on YouTube now.

1195
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,920
It's a big lift for me to do 20 minutes, right?

1196
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,800
To make a 20 minute argument.

1197
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,360
You're doing a three hour argument

1198
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,960
where you're doing a vast amount of reading

1199
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,480
and also original thought.

1200
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,160
And I just would, I'm dying to know like

1201
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,760
a little bit about your process.

1202
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,520
Like when you're reading a hundred books, right?

1203
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,560
And you are trying to get your head around this argument

1204
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,920
that you want to make.

1205
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,480
What are you then doing with the book?

1206
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,560
Are you, do you have a note taking process?

1207
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,480
Like how are you assembling this argument as you go?

1208
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,120
Yeah, my methods for making this video

1209
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,720
were actually like so crazy that I can never do this again

1210
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,080
because it took so long.

1211
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,680
Like I have, okay.

1212
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,520
I have a dog here.

1213
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,840
How long did it take you all together by the way?

1214
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,000
Just how long were you working on this?

1215
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,160
I mean, I think I started it,

1216
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,680
I think I started it in like June, 2022

1217
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,720
and then published like March, 2024.

1218
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,120
So more than a year and a half.

1219
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,360
I mean, I was working on other things in between

1220
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,200
but I think that, when I say reading a hundred books,

1221
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,280
how long did it take me to read a hundred books?

1222
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,200
Well, usually it takes me more than one day

1223
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,800
to read one book.

1224
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,200
So, you know, there were a lot of reading days.

1225
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,080
And I had, I was writing down the quotes

1226
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,160
that I thought were interesting.

1227
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,760
I have a document on my computer

1228
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,320
that has more than a hundred thousand words

1229
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,720
of quotes and notes stuffed into it,

1230
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,600
which is just an insane, I mean, that's,

1231
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,920
that's, you know, at least novel length

1232
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,080
as just a notes document.

1233
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,800
And then most of that, obviously I didn't use

1234
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,520
because I way overdid the note taking.

1235
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,160
I'm not, that's why I say I'm not doing that again

1236
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,480
because there's probably a more efficient way to use time,

1237
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,440
which I'm trying to do

1238
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,920
because I don't want to just make one video

1239
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,040
every year and a half.

1240
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,960
So I've got to find ways to be a little more efficient

1241
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,840
than that.

1242
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,640
But for this one project, I was like,

1243
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,160
oh, I just, I just felt like really committing

1244
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,280
to the bookish element of it.

1245
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,280
So I, I made, you know, I guess a one time commitment

1246
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,920
to just to put in basically a year's worth of research.

1247
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,200
I really feel that making YouTube videos myself,

1248
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,520
the pull between spending as much time

1249
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,800
as you want on something

1250
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,200
and getting things out more quickly.

1251
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,440
I'm constantly trying to evaluate that myself

1252
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,320
with the work that I make.

1253
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,600
How do you think about, you know,

1254
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,240
pace and, you know, nurturing your audience on YouTube?

1255
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,920
Because as you say, you are a YouTuber.

1256
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,600
Being a YouTuber puts you at the mercy of the algorithm,

1257
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,400
at the, of the audience of these sort of, you know,

1258
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,720
very mechanized processes that determine success or failure.

1259
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,200
It seems like it would take a lot of trust

1260
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,360
to spend a year and a half on something

1261
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,520
and know that it will be watched on the other end

1262
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,920
and not be anxious about, ah, shouldn't I have put out,

1263
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,920
you know, 12 more videos in that period of time?

1264
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,560
Wouldn't that be better for my numbers?

1265
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,400
Like that's sort of thinking.

1266
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,240
How do you think about that?

1267
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,640
Oh, well, it definitely would be better for you

1268
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,360
for my numbers if I had made 12 videos

1269
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,520
instead of one three-hour video.

1270
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,080
I mean, I think that for me.

1271
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,280
Really? Because the three-hour video does well, you know.

1272
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,400
Yeah, well, okay, that's, I mean,

1273
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,880
I do think that long videos are,

1274
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,880
do seem to be doing well on YouTube lately.

1275
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,320
I think that when I was building an audience,

1276
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,320
I would never have been able,

1277
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,240
I don't think to do something like this.

1278
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,880
This is, this is kind of the like,

1279
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,600
the like luxury stuff you get to do

1280
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,080
if you have, you have already like built that foundation.

1281
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:35,920
Yeah.

1282
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,760
I definitely think there was like a period

1283
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,760
of having to grind a little bit to get, you know,

1284
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,640
videos that have at least every couple of months.

1285
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,120
And because, you know, at first you worry,

1286
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,800
we worry, you do worry a lot about like,

1287
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,520
oh, is the audience even going to still be there?

1288
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,560
I feel at this point, like I have built enough

1289
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,640
of a long-term audience that will kind of trust

1290
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,200
the process a little bit.

1291
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,960
And, you know, they will,

1292
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,840
I can, I feel like I can count on them

1293
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,040
to watch when I come up with a new thing,

1294
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,040
even if it's been a while.

1295
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,600
So I tend to worry about that a little less,

1296
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,240
though I do also think that, you know,

1297
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,640
a year and a half is too long.

1298
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,240
And I think that I benefit from a little bit

1299
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,800
because at a certain point with the research,

1300
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,840
there's, there are diminishing returns

1301
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,080
to spending more than a year on researching a video.

1302
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,880
I think at a certain point, you know,

1303
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,000
you have to say, okay, that's enough,

1304
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,160
like save the rest of the research for another video.

1305
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,760
So that's, that's from now on, I'm trying to do that

1306
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,800
because I do, I do want to make videos

1307
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,640
a little more frequently than once a year.

1308
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,480
Well, it's fascinating because you could have made

1309
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,200
just a video about, hey, I've been reading Twilight

1310
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,640
and there was a moral panic about this series

1311
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,680
and that misunderstands the nature of fantasy.

1312
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,040
And that would have been one great video

1313
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,440
that could have gotten a million views on its own,

1314
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,040
but that is one point within this massive edifice

1315
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,760
that you built.

1316
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,320
And so yeah, I'm curious about,

1317
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,640
is there some value to you in your creative process

1318
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,760
of exploring so much in a single video

1319
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,960
rather than chunking it up or making a more,

1320
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,920
you know, I often look to make one discrete point, maybe two.

1321
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,360
And if I do more than that, I start going,

1322
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,040
ah, maybe I'm getting too over ambitious

1323
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,760
and I need to scale it back.

1324
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,280
Whereas this video is so incredibly maximalist

1325
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,640
in its conception and design,

1326
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,080
is there something about that that draws you?

1327
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:19,920
Yes, there is.

1328
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,560
And it's hard for me to explain what it is,

1329
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,040
but I do think that that I am sort of ambitiously drawn

1330
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,840
towards like more and more elaborate projects.

1331
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,960
It's something that I have to like fight in myself

1332
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,640
to not, to make every video not be three hours long,

1333
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,200
but I do think that I like,

1334
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,040
I don't know, there's something,

1335
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,760
there's something fun to me to be exploring one topic

1336
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,640
from like every possible angle.

1337
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,600
And I don't know, there seems to be an audience

1338
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,040
that is appreciative of that kind of like

1339
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,240
extremely thorough deep dive.

1340
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,440
You know, I think that,

1341
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,520
there was a time I remember when YouTubers

1342
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,640
were basically giving the advice,

1343
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,160
like go no more than 10 minutes,

1344
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,600
like no one has an attention span anymore in this day.

1345
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,760
And now like people just regularly watch content

1346
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,720
that's hours long.

1347
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,040
I think part of it has to do with, you know,

1348
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,040
the way that people watch videos has changed.

1349
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,440
I think a lot of people, you know,

1350
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,440
they watch a video kind of like,

1351
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,120
kind of like they listen to a podcast, right?

1352
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,520
It's kind of on, you know, maybe, you know,

1353
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,080
I'm not so, I'm not so arrogant

1354
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,920
that I think everyone who watches my videos

1355
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,360
has to sit down at the TV with a full thing of popcorn

1356
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,920
and give me their undivided attention.

1357
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,600
I mean, I guess I'd be flattered if people do that,

1358
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,480
but I'm sure, I mean, that's not how I watch video essays.

1359
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,320
I mean, I'm doing the laundry.

1360
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,840
YouTube is also the most popular streaming service

1361
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,680
on television.

1362
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,880
Like it is more popular than Netflix.

1363
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,080
And so surely some people are doing that.

1364
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,160
They're loading it up.

1365
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,320
They're no longer just, you know,

1366
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,560
clicking on a link at work, you know, in a browser tab.

1367
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,600
And so there's been a lot of changes.

1368
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,800
Yeah, and I do try to, I mean,

1369
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,200
I do put effort into like visuals and things.

1370
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,600
I do want to reward the people who have taken, you know,

1371
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,120
who have put the video up on their TV

1372
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,600
and are sitting down to watch it.

1373
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,800
I do want it to make that worth people's while,

1374
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,000
but I also know that, you know,

1375
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,560
some people are cooking dinner and that's fine too.

1376
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,720
You make almost every element of these videos yourself, right?

1377
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,360
In addition to writing them, you also,

1378
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,200
my understanding is you're your own DP.

1379
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,040
You do your own lighting.

1380
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,000
You do your own editing.

1381
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,240
I believe you have other folks do the music.

1382
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,600
Do I have that basically right?

1383
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,240
Yeah, that's right.

1384
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,440
I definitely, people always ask me like,

1385
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,200
why are you doing this to yourself?

1386
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,840
Like, why don't you hire more people to do it?

1387
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,200
That was my next question now.

1388
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,760
You have the money to do it.

1389
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,600
Yeah, I feel like, well,

1390
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,640
I think I've just gotten so used to doing it

1391
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,440
in this kind of solitary way

1392
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,240
that now it kind of feels like I would be like,

1393
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,080
I don't know, I would be taking my own,

1394
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,680
I feel like what people like about my videos

1395
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,160
probably is that I made them on some level.

1396
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,320
And so, I think there's something that sort of comes across

1397
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,320
from like one person's like manic project.

1398
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,800
Like, even, I mean, I don't know,

1399
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,320
even if there's imperfections,

1400
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,480
which I'm sure there are, right?

1401
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,440
Like, there are ways that a professional

1402
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,240
could probably like do better lighting or something.

1403
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,760
But I don't know, there's like,

1404
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,000
I have like the way that I do it

1405
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,280
and I think it gives the videos

1406
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,800
kind of a distinctive feel.

1407
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,320
I just think it's something that people pick up on.

1408
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,480
And also maybe it's just me being like a reclusive loner

1409
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,800
or whatever and not wanting to deal

1410
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,960
with the social element of having up.

1411
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,160
No, that's such a great answer.

1412
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,640
I mean, I've learned in my own work

1413
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,480
how much the process is the product

1414
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,560
and I actually experienced, you know,

1415
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,040
I came from doing videos on a website called College Humor.

1416
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,320
We had our low budget way of doing things

1417
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,720
and I experienced later on

1418
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,480
when I was doing work on Netflix,

1419
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,160
there were things that I wanted to do

1420
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,760
that were actually harder to do with more resources

1421
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,560
than when I had less.

1422
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,160
And I would try to get certain sort of gags done,

1423
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,200
certain sort of visual effects,

1424
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,920
try to use things on a certain timeline.

1425
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,640
And the more expensive crews that we had to work with said,

1426
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,760
we don't know how to do it that way.

1427
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,040
I was like, oh, well, the 25 year old I used to work with

1428
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,880
like could help me do it that way, right?

1429
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,960
And so the process is the product.

1430
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,800
The way you make the thing is how the thing comes out.

1431
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,360
And so I understand, yeah,

1432
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,120
if that's how you got started doing it all yourself,

1433
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,200
that's what the audience likes.

1434
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,200
That's the way you do it.

1435
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,640
You maybe don't wanna fuck with something that's working

1436
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,880
because what the audience likes

1437
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,920
partially is the feeling of watching this lady go crazy

1438
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,120
in her own house at 4 a.m.

1439
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,680
You know, they like a little bit of that feeling.

1440
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,000
I think that's exactly what it is.

1441
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,320
Cause I think there's a certain vibe

1442
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,040
for you for a better term

1443
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,360
to a person like manically recording a video

1444
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,240
in a room alone at four in the morning.

1445
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,080
Like, I don't know.

1446
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,800
I don't know if that could be replicated

1447
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,920
if I weren't literally doing that.

1448
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,160
Yeah. So I don't know.

1449
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,000
So in terms of your audience,

1450
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,960
you are entirely audience supported.

1451
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,600
I don't think you take ads of any kind.

1452
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,960
There is, that's a wonderful thing that's possible now

1453
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,640
in today's internet media ecosystem.

1454
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,640
It's also, there's a hazard of audience capture

1455
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,360
of your audience driving what you're doing too much

1456
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,000
or of feeling at the whim of your audience.

1457
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,840
What has your experience been with that

1458
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,440
and how do you resist that affecting your work?

1459
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,520
Well, I am very grateful to Patreon

1460
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,920
for allowing me to like have a financially viable career

1461
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,440
without filling the videos with ads.

1462
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,320
That it's a good model.

1463
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,480
I do think that as you say,

1464
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,240
there's a hazardous side to it,

1465
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,160
which is that, you know, it's not the,

1466
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,640
in a way you don't have a boss,

1467
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,160
but in another way your boss is like this mob, right?

1468
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,960
This group of a few thousand people

1469
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,560
who are funding your project.

1470
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,240
So you do, you are kind of accountable to them in a way.

1471
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,080
So how do you not just become a people pleaser?

1472
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:24,920
Yeah.

1473
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:25,760
Well, I think, I mean, I've been,

1474
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,320
lately I've been doing these like Patreon only videos

1475
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,520
that, you know, I'm just charging people two months,

1476
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,920
two dollars a month or whatever to watch them.

1477
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,560
And then our people can pay more to vote on the topic.

1478
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,200
And I do think that people who vote on topics

1479
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,480
that are sort of, that are different than what I would,

1480
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,120
I don't think anyone would have voted for Twilight,

1481
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,560
for example, right?

1482
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,080
I don't think that if I had had a poll

1483
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,760
to decide what my next video was going to be,

1484
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,560
I don't think Twilight would have gotten a lot of votes.

1485
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,880
You know, people tend to vote for things,

1486
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,120
well, one things they've heard of.

1487
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,600
So it has to be something familiar.

1488
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,440
It has to be often something topical.

1489
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,280
We'll get more votes than something that's, you know,

1490
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,000
kind of outdated or that doesn't seem particularly relevant

1491
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,840
to the moment.

1492
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,280
But yeah, I do think that there's something to be said

1493
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,120
for me trying, you know,

1494
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,800
using that kind of voting feedback

1495
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,560
so that I kind of keep in touch

1496
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,040
with what people care about.

1497
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,000
But I do think that it's also good

1498
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,880
for the main channel videos

1499
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,480
that I'm not just taking,

1500
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,400
that I'm not just having the topic dictated to me

1501
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,760
by the audience demand.

1502
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,760
Because I think a lot of times people don't know

1503
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,880
what they want or, you know,

1504
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,840
the most exciting content I feel like comes from,

1505
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,400
I had no idea that I wanted this, right?

1506
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,400
Like, I would not have asked someone to make a three hour

1507
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,560
video analyzing Twilight from every imaginable

1508
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,600
philosophical angle, but hopefully now that it's here,

1509
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,640
they like it.

1510
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,240
I think also, you know, a lot of times what you think

1511
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,080
you want is more of what you've liked in the past,

1512
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,920
which I think can kind of stifle,

1513
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,800
it can stifle innovation or change where,

1514
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,920
well, I mean, look what's happened with movies

1515
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,880
where everything's a sequel now, right?

1516
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,080
I think that you can become too conservative

1517
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,640
in terms of what you are willing to experiment

1518
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,280
with creatively if the way that you choose

1519
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,800
what projects to work on is just informed

1520
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,760
by what has succeeded in the past.

1521
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,480
Well, then you just make the same thing again and again,

1522
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,680
and no innovation ever happens.

1523
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,320
Yeah, and if you just make the thing

1524
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,080
that the audience says that they want,

1525
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,360
there is some value in that.

1526
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,400
That is something that the,

1527
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,240
there's an value in pleasing the audience.

1528
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,840
But if that's all that you do,

1529
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,920
the audience is never surprised.

1530
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,040
That's what always bothers me so much about,

1531
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:38,200
you know, it's a cliche, but fans of IP media,

1532
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,600
of superhero media or whatever, being like,

1533
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,920
we didn't want this, this isn't what the fans asked for,

1534
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,120
sort of discourse, why didn't they ask us

1535
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,920
before they made the new Star Wars?

1536
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,600
Like, well, is that what you want?

1537
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,920
Like you didn't know, you wouldn't have known

1538
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,400
to ask for the first Star Wars movie before it came out,

1539
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,680
because it was a unique act of creativity

1540
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,040
on the part of this weird dude, George Lucas.

1541
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,160
And in fact, that was what we liked about it.

1542
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,280
And the reappraisal of the Star Wars prequels

1543
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,680
is exactly about that, that George was just being weird.

1544
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,080
And that was kind of more interesting

1545
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,760
than some mega corporation trying to give people

1546
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,360
exactly what they wanted.

1547
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,440
We don't get serendipity and surprise in media that way.

1548
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,720
Yeah, I completely agree with that.

1549
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,600
And I do think that it's too bad that,

1550
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,800
well, I do think that I have an increasing sense,

1551
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,120
I mean, Star Wars is probably literally the case

1552
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,240
that a lot of creative decisions

1553
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,920
are basically being made in corporate boardrooms.

1554
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,880
And, yeah, I mean, it seemed, that's how it feels.

1555
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,200
It comes across, like I liked your slogan

1556
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,840
about the process as a product.

1557
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,120
It comes across, right, week we can tell.

1558
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:46,200
And, yeah, totally, you could just basically remake

1559
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,680
the first Star Wars movie now,

1560
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,640
but it wouldn't have the same impact that it had initially,

1561
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:53,560
because we've already seen Star Wars make a new thing, right?

1562
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,880
Yeah, yeah.

1563
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,960
You are diagnosing the exact problem with my business.

1564
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,680
Yeah, that nobody is making new things currently.

1565
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,240
Everybody was trying to figure out,

1566
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,880
this has worked in the past,

1567
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,280
so let's make another one of those.

1568
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,840
What is working and nobody is taking a chance

1569
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,000
on the new thing.

1570
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,080
And one of the real ironies of creative work in Hollywood,

1571
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,040
at least, is even the executives don't know what they want,

1572
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,680
because if they did, they would be writers and directors,

1573
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,360
but they aren't, because they are not the creative people.

1574
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:27,840
You at some point need to trust a creative person saying,

1575
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,280
I think this is a good idea, I just wanna make it,

1576
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,680
you should believe in me.

1577
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:36,240
If you wanna get the thing that is a surprise hit,

1578
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,640
that changes the culture or makes things go in a new way.

1579
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,280
Yeah, it requires you to take chances,

1580
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,880
which means that sometimes you'll lose,

1581
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,720
but I also think that the super conservative approach to,

1582
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,240
oh, just keep making the same thing that worked in the past.

1583
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,520
I think that's a very short-term way of thinking,

1584
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,960
where people will eventually get bored,

1585
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,840
of you making the exact same superhero movie again and again.

1586
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:00,520
And I think that, even economically,

1587
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,160
that will eventually cost you,

1588
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,760
it's worth it, I think,

1589
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,720
to take chances on someone who's trying something new.

1590
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,920
Sometimes it won't work, but when it does,

1591
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,800
it really pays off.

1592
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,080
Yeah, and that's why some of the best media brands

1593
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,920
are the ones that you get used to

1594
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,480
taking an interesting chance,

1595
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,920
where, oh, if this came out, HBO used to be like this,

1596
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,520
oh, they put a lot of money into something,

1597
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,360
I don't know if it's for me.

1598
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,560
You know what, I'll watch a couple,

1599
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,400
just because I have a certain expectation.

1600
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,760
I think people have that same expectation of your work.

1601
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,240
Normally, I had no interest in Twilight, right?

1602
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,400
It was not particularly on my radar,

1603
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,360
but, oh, Natalie has a new video out

1604
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,560
that's three hours of Natalie talking about Twilight.

1605
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,560
I am interested in that,

1606
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,960
because I have seen your past work,

1607
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:47,120
and I know that you are going to surprise and delight me.

1608
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,880
I love your approach of your slaking the audience's thirst

1609
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,600
to have a say with your Patreon videos,

1610
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,760
and then you are separately using that

1611
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:58,840
to be able to fund your crazy passion products,

1612
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,680
which are the things that people actually want of you.

1613
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,680
That's a wonderful audience expectation to set.

1614
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,760
Yeah, and it does require me

1615
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,440
to have a level of trust in my own audience.

1616
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,120
I'm trusting them to trust me, in a way.

1617
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,960
Like, I know you probably don't think

1618
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,240
you want a three-hour video about Twilight,

1619
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,800
but I have an idea for one that I think you probably do want.

1620
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,200
Just let me do it, and then we'll see.

1621
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,320
I'm sure I will occasionally do projects that don't hit,

1622
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,560
because no one has all hits,

1623
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,760
but I think it's worth it to me to take the risk,

1624
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:30,440
because I don't want to stultify, you know?

1625
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,160
Do you have bigger aspirations in media?

1626
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,240
Because, look, again, in the field I'm in,

1627
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,000
I'm always like, my instinct is how is that a TV show?

1628
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,240
Or how is that a movie?

1629
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,960
Or how is that just what's the bigger version of the thing?

1630
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:49,960
Which is a very capitalist fueled impulse

1631
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,320
that comes from the media environment

1632
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:55,480
that I have to work in, because that's the life I live.

1633
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,480
Whereas you have absolute freedom,

1634
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,760
where you're able to make a living and do what you want.

1635
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,560
And yet, you know, this video is so ambitious.

1636
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,880
I'm curious if you just, you know,

1637
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,680
is there more that you want to do and in what direction?

1638
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,000
Well, I'm pretty happy with the current process.

1639
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,360
I mean, is there more that I want to do?

1640
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,400
Yes, but I feel like the more that I want to do

1641
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,280
is not necessarily what most people imagine I would want to do.

1642
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,240
People ask me all the time,

1643
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,960
like, aren't you going to have like a Netflix show

1644
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,240
or something at some point?

1645
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,560
Or, you know, when are you going to like have a,

1646
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,360
I mean, they don't say when you're going to have a real job,

1647
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,920
but there's some, there's some of these things

1648
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,760
like a little bit of an implication of that.

1649
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,440
When are you going to make it big, right?

1650
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,680
That's the idea, that's the implication.

1651
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,840
Yeah, when are you going to make it big?

1652
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,840
I'm pretty happy making it medium, actually, at the moment.

1653
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,560
Like, I think that I like the independence

1654
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:45,600
and I like the fact that I can do like weird experimental things.

1655
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,240
And I like the kind of direct relationship to the audience

1656
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,040
that I feel like I have through Patreon,

1657
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,600
where it's not mediated by a studio.

1658
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,440
I don't know.

1659
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,480
There's not to say that I will never try, you know,

1660
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:02,760
doing something that is with a more conventional,

1661
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,720
you know, production approach.

1662
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,960
But I feel like for the time being,

1663
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,560
I'm pretty happy with the way that this works out

1664
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,800
with Patreon and with the audience on YouTube.

1665
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,760
And so I'm not like itching to change it up in that sense.

1666
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,000
Yeah, I would also ask,

1667
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,600
oh, would you ever want to write a book?

1668
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,200
Except that again, the video to me has the density of a book.

1669
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,920
Every sentence is something that I want to pause and unpack

1670
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,720
and reread, and yet is being seen by more people.

1671
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,760
You are able to, I think, probably make a better living at it

1672
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,360
than you would if you were to publish it as a book.

1673
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:40,000
Is there, it seems kind of perfect

1674
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,720
for getting the ideas that you want to get out out.

1675
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,920
And yet I think there's maybe a YouTube stench

1676
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:48,600
that I feel as well of, isn't there some

1677
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,920
more legitimate place to go?

1678
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,920
No, I mean, people asked that too, right?

1679
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,160
When are you going to write a book?

1680
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,680
Well, I don't know, I might write a book.

1681
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,000
I may well write a book someday,

1682
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,920
probably when I get tired of looking

1683
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,200
at my face on the screen.

1684
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:05,200
But I think that I feel like I've put so much time

1685
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,720
into learning the skills of doing video essays

1686
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,240
that I feel like I may still continue doing the thing

1687
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,360
that I know I'm good at.

1688
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,880
I mean, part of that, of course, is writing.

1689
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,400
And I'm sure that that skill would transfer over

1690
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,320
to writing a book.

1691
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,880
So again, I think I haven't ruled that out.

1692
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:23,840
I imagine myself writing a book someday,

1693
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,440
but for the time being, all the ideas that I have

1694
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,520
for books, I feel like I end up making them into videos.

1695
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:32,160
So it's not, it doesn't seem like a super pressing need

1696
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,120
for me to switch media.

1697
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,080
I don't feel that you'll ever get sick

1698
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:37,960
of looking at your own face.

1699
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,360
If you spent this long doing it,

1700
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,920
you have the same sickness that I do where...

1701
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,120
If the narcissism has lasted this long,

1702
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,080
I should be in the clear, right?

1703
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,760
Yeah, if you want this many people,

1704
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,960
if you have spent this much time

1705
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,080
trying to get people to look at you,

1706
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,520
you must want people to do it.

1707
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,120
That's never gonna leave you.

1708
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:57,560
Yeah, it's a long-term personality defect.

1709
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,560
What have you been thinking about

1710
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,120
or reading more recently that is...

1711
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,320
I mean, this video took you a year and a half.

1712
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,840
It came out a few months ago.

1713
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,040
What directions do you find yourself being pulled now

1714
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,240
in terms of your interests?

1715
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,200
Well, I spent so much time on this Twilight video

1716
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,960
that I net like for the last few months,

1717
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,800
I just avoid anything romance fiction.

1718
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,840
I'm like, I thought about it for a year and a half.

1719
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:19,680
I can't stand it.

1720
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,600
In another year, I'm sure it'll interest me again

1721
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,800
and I'll go back to it.

1722
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,280
But yeah, I definitely will do something

1723
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,800
completely different next.

1724
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,040
Obviously, well, I'm very anxious

1725
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,080
about American politics this year.

1726
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,120
So I think probably I'll get something

1727
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,040
sort of a little bit more directly political,

1728
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,520
politically engaging next.

1729
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,080
I've been doing research for most of my adult life

1730
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,480
on conspiracy theories.

1731
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,800
So that's something that definitely interests me

1732
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,480
as a possible topic.

1733
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,320
And those go together.

1734
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,320
I mean, American politics this year

1735
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,400
and conspiracy theories, it feels like we're living

1736
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,080
in a more conspiratorial politics than ever.

1737
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,240
I remember a time when conspiracism

1738
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,800
was this kind of counter-cultural thing

1739
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,560
like in the Bush era or early Obama years.

1740
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,160
But now, yeah, it's fun.

1741
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:07,600
It was like, you know, Men in Black was a movie, right?

1742
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,880
It wasn't something that people actually believed in.

1743
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,960
Right, or it was, I mean,

1744
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,920
I guess there was always the 9-11 truth stuff and that.

1745
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,680
But even that, it never seemed very threatening to me.

1746
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,600
I guess, I don't know, but maybe it should have

1747
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,800
because now, I mean, at this stage,

1748
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,000
like the Republican Party may as well be

1749
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,000
a conspiracist party where like central ideas of Trump

1750
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,480
include the idea that the elections are rigged.

1751
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:38,320
So that's not, you know, this is not counter-culture anymore.

1752
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,680
This guy was president.

1753
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,040
He's friends with Alex Jones,

1754
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,440
or at least they're in communication.

1755
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,520
So this is, you know,

1756
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,640
I've been talking with some people lately

1757
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,680
about whether QAnon is totally irrelevant now.

1758
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,080
And I think that it's not irrelevant.

1759
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,600
But the reason that it's not irrelevant

1760
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,640
is that it's actually, a lot of the pieces of QAnon

1761
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:03,640
have just become incorporated into the main of the Republican Party.

1762
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:08,480
So, you know, yeah, we're not talking about Q,

1763
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:12,880
but the idea that the deep state is rigging elections,

1764
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,640
for example, or the idea, like all this stuff

1765
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,840
is basically just mainstream American political ideas now.

1766
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:24,680
So it's, you know, it's a long-standing tendency,

1767
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,880
I guess, in American politics.

1768
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,520
Like there's that essay from the 60s

1769
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,960
on the paranoid style in American politics

1770
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,200
about like the Goldwater campaign, I guess.

1771
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,960
And, you know, in the 50s and 60s,

1772
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,800
there was like the John Birch Society

1773
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,440
and all this idea of, you know,

1774
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,160
like you see in Dr. Strangelove,

1775
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,080
where there's this character ranting about

1776
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,080
the fluoridation of water being a communist plot.

1777
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,080
So it's not like this is new.

1778
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,080
Yeah, I guess our vital fluids, yeah.

1779
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:50,480
Yeah, the pressure is bodily fluids,

1780
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,520
which I guess is kind of like a,

1781
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,800
this kind of like a predecessor to the anti-vax movement.

1782
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,400
This is the stuff I'm thinking about lately.

1783
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,280
Like I would have been an RFK voter.

1784
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,120
Yeah, completely.

1785
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:04,040
Have you, and yeah, the conspiracy mindset,

1786
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,480
it's not just that the literal conspiracy theories

1787
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,640
have infected the Republican Party,

1788
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,440
but the sort of behavior of conspiracy hunting

1789
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,200
has infected almost everybody.

1790
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,320
You see Democrats or, you know,

1791
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,880
people who don't call themselves political at all,

1792
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,200
just go down these rabbit holes constantly

1793
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,920
of and undermine everything that they think they know,

1794
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,280
et cetera, with that type of thinking,

1795
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:30,240
even when it isn't specifically a right-wing conspiracy theory

1796
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,920
of the type that we're most used to.

1797
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,880
Yeah, it's really a style,

1798
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,080
maybe a style of, I mean, paranoid style, right?

1799
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,280
It's a style of thinking more than anything

1800
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,640
that can be applied to like literally anything.

1801
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,320
I mean, I feel like it's gotten to a point

1802
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,680
where any significant event that happens in American

1803
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:50,680
or world politics or news will be kind of,

1804
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,000
it will have like a host of theories around it

1805
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,360
about how it's an inside job,

1806
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,400
or it's a hoax, or it's this and that, right?

1807
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,920
I think it's just become a kind of-

1808
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,680
The Kate Middleton photo is a perfect example of that, right?

1809
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,360
I mean, Taylor Swift will drop an album and there's people

1810
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,400
theorizing about how she's just secretly gay,

1811
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,840
and she's like, I mean, it's everything.

1812
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,200
Yeah, my friend, the very funny comedian, Sammi Mauri,

1813
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,440
said that Taylor Swift is queuing on for girls.

1814
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,720
That's their joke.

1815
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,880
Yeah, it's a truth.

1816
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,360
And people are like connecting the red string,

1817
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,040
like between Taylor Swift songs.

1818
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,600
That is the accepted mode of consumption

1819
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,680
for the biggest mainstream pop artist in America,

1820
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,480
is to treat her like you are uncovering a vast conspiracy.

1821
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,640
Right, and she's dropping these like cryptic clues,

1822
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,240
and it's your job to like to go down the rabbit hole

1823
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,120
and figure out the truth.

1824
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,360
It's, yeah, I mean, people seem to find this way

1825
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:46,080
of engaging with anything very, very exciting, right?

1826
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,120
I think it kind of, it puts you in the role

1827
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,720
of an investigator, right?

1828
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,360
Everyone thinks they're Sherlock Holmes,

1829
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,640
and you feel like you can find some kind of truth

1830
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,000
that has been hidden.

1831
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,200
I think that there's something,

1832
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,600
I mean, maybe this takes us back

1833
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,040
to the romance topic, actually,

1834
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:05,040
because in a way, that desire to like find what is concealed,

1835
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,240
or like overcome some kind of veil of illusion,

1836
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,720
I feel that that in itself is a kind of like,

1837
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,800
you know, tension and release type thing,

1838
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,360
where, you know, why is a hidden truth

1839
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,200
is more exciting than an open truth, right?

1840
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,040
Yeah.

1841
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,440
Because there's this element of pursuit of search involved.

1842
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,400
So it's exciting to discover a secret, I guess.

1843
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,560
And so people go looking for secrets anywhere.

1844
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,400
I mean, I literally have just been playing a video game

1845
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,040
called Animal Well that is entirely built

1846
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,640
around the search for secrets.

1847
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,240
And that's like the, there's the motivating factor

1848
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,760
in the game, and that's sort of an odd thing to bring up,

1849
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,160
but it's literally what it reminded me of.

1850
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,520
Oh, I was doing this for fun just last week

1851
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,800
of like hunting, hunting.

1852
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,640
What does this mean?

1853
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,960
What does that mean?

1854
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,800
I love the connection, though, to,

1855
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,920
I believe you said in the video,

1856
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,920
this is just written in my list of quotes.

1857
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,360
You wrote philosophical questions

1858
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,440
that would never be definitively answered

1859
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,120
as being part of their allure, I think,

1860
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,200
and like our desire to answer them.

1861
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,000
They can't be definitively answered.

1862
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,360
So we're always questing after them.

1863
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,200
Is that correct?

1864
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,040
Am I misrepresenting you?

1865
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,720
Yeah, I think that's part of the appeal of philosophy

1866
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,200
is that there's, you know, we're asking these big questions

1867
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,960
that seem to defy definitive solution.

1868
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:21,760
Yeah.

1869
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,600
And so I think that is part of what's exciting about it

1870
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,160
is the desire to find out something

1871
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,120
that is, that seems like it's always eluding us.

1872
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,640
So I wanted to ask,

1873
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,120
because this is a question of perpetual fascination for me,

1874
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,640
what do you think it is that philosophy does?

1875
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,720
Because there's often, you know,

1876
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,160
a realization I had after being very, very intent

1877
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,960
and fascinated by philosophy for many years,

1878
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,520
I realized, hold on a second, exactly this,

1879
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,520
none of these questions are ever answered, you know?

1880
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,960
People are still arguing with Plato and Descartes

1881
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,360
and every philosopher for hundreds of years.

1882
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,640
And so isn't that shameful

1883
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,760
that philosophy never makes progress

1884
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,800
in the way that science does?

1885
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,000
Ever had essays to that effect?

1886
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,680
I was talking to the philosopher Quill Kukla about this

1887
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:07,120
and they said that what they think it indicates

1888
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,240
is that philosophy is more of an art than a science

1889
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,760
or a practice.

1890
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,320
I'm just curious how you think of it.

1891
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,680
Like what is the thing that you are trying to do

1892
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,280
when you are answering these questions

1893
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,760
if they can never be definitively answered?

1894
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,560
Well, I think it does a lot of different things.

1895
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,480
One thing it maybe does is take a mystery

1896
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,440
and then clarify the mystery

1897
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,360
so that even if you don't have a definitive answer,

1898
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,080
you at least have a better understanding

1899
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,400
of what it is that you don't understand.

1900
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,400
I think another thing I can do is kind of,

1901
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,000
again, like sort of clarify concepts that are kind of murky

1902
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
or sort of bring out something that's sort of implicit

1903
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,800
and make it explicit in a discourse.

1904
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,200
So I mean, this I think has a potential

1905
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,960
to be useful to science, right?

1906
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,840
At least in certain fields where maybe there's a question of,

1907
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,600
I guess psychology comes to mind where,

1908
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,400
what are we talking about?

1909
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,840
When we talk about consciousness

1910
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,880
versus being unconscious,

1911
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,800
that the question actually kind of

1912
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,000
is conceptually complicated in a way

1913
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,080
that is not clear to me,

1914
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:20,400
that it's easily solved just through experimentation.

1915
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,760
Before doing an experiment,

1916
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,360
you have to have a conceptual framework

1917
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,040
for what it is that you're testing.

1918
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,960
Yeah, and in fact, on this show in recent months,

1919
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,320
we've had on different neuroscientists

1920
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,560
who are arguing between themselves

1921
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,400
about whether humans have free will, et cetera.

1922
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,480
And my reaction to all of them is you have committed

1923
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,480
a philosophical error in that you don't know

1924
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,000
what you mean by the phrase free will yet,

1925
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,240
or that's the disagreement and you won't acknowledge it.

1926
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:49,600
Like that sort of problem is a classic one

1927
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,200
that can only be addressed by philosophy.

1928
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,440
Yeah, I don't think the question of,

1929
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,760
do humans have free will and in what sense, if so,

1930
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,920
or if not, I don't think that's a question

1931
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:03,480
that's going to be answered by doing functional MRI scans

1932
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,320
of the brain.

1933
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,960
There's a certain type of evidence

1934
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,240
that MRI studies are going to supply,

1935
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,600
and that certain type of evidence

1936
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,000
is always going to have to do with what amount of blood

1937
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,880
is flowing to which brain region,

1938
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,760
which is not gonna really answer your free will question.

1939
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,200
You kind of need to like to transform that

1940
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,280
into something that can be empirically verified.

1941
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,840
I think so, but yeah, the question about free will

1942
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,640
is what do we mean by free will

1943
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,600
and what is the relationship between free will

1944
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:37,600
and say chemistry or these seemingly deterministic

1945
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,600
levels of analysis?

1946
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,680
Yeah, we might not get a final understand,

1947
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,120
we might not get a final answer to that question,

1948
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,360
but if we actually examine it,

1949
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:49,400
we might understand a lot more about ourselves

1950
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,600
than like all of these other things.

1951
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,280
In the same way that you're exploring twilight

1952
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,840
and you are coming to what I found fascinating conclusions

1953
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:00,400
about human sexuality, fantasy, genre fiction,

1954
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,880
you know, gender itself, I mean,

1955
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:07,800
it's just such an incredible tour de force, I don't know.

1956
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,360
Are you happy with a response to the video?

1957
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,000
Like are people, are they taking it in the way

1958
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:13,920
that you hoped that they would?

1959
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,240
Yeah, I'm very happy with it.

1960
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,400
I think that a lot of people have given it a chance

1961
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:22,280
and I'm always very appreciative of the kinds of comments

1962
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,800
that people leave on my videos.

1963
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,920
I feel like I am proud to have a better

1964
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,640
than average YouTube comments section.

1965
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,200
People often like write paragraphs of texts

1966
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,680
and some of it is very, very interesting.

1967
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,560
People have their own ideas and insights

1968
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:38,000
where people will challenge a certain point I made.

1969
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,680
I'm always very appreciative of people

1970
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,600
taking the time to do that

1971
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,480
because I know these comments just get lost

1972
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,520
in a sea of comments, but I do try,

1973
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,360
I do read a lot of them and a lot of them,

1974
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,080
unfortunately, are actually worth reading.

1975
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,640
So yeah, I'm happy about that.

1976
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,600
I mean, you really like strike me as a,

1977
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,520
a philosopher from a few hundred years ago,

1978
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,120
like reading your correspondences,

1979
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,200
you know, you publish your monograph

1980
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,800
and then you get all the responses back

1981
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,040
and people debate and et cetera.

1982
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:09,360
It's just fascinating to see work of this caliber

1983
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,600
come across on a platform that most people to write

1984
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,160
as being really superficial and stupid

1985
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,920
and you're one of the most, you know,

1986
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,200
successful and popular YouTubers

1987
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,760
and you're doing honest to God philosophy

1988
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,280
and psychology and analysis on there.

1989
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:25,080
It's, I don't know, it's, it's incredible to see.

1990
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,400
Yeah, sorry, go.

1991
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,440
Yeah, the feedback is definitely one of the things

1992
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,520
I like about YouTube.

1993
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,160
As you say, a YouTube comment section has a reputation

1994
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:36,000
as being like the worst of what the internet has to offer.

1995
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,880
It certainly can be, but I think that I also, you know,

1996
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:40,880
it's a mix of things.

1997
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,920
Like some people just say that I'm ugly or whatever.

1998
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,080
So, okay, thank you.

1999
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,760
But, you know, I think that mixed in with that

2000
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,280
is a lot of people who are leaving

2001
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,000
actually very thoughtful ideas

2002
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,960
and it's actually something I look forward to

2003
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,000
whenever I publish a video

2004
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,600
is like seeing what people will say in response.

2005
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,520
It's almost like I want people to like challenge me back.

2006
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,520
Like, I want people to engage with what I'm thinking about

2007
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,760
because I know they'll come up, you know,

2008
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,920
people have different experiences,

2009
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,520
they have different expertise and I do,

2010
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,640
they'll come up with a bunch of stuff

2011
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,640
that I didn't occur to me.

2012
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,640
And it's always very interesting to,

2013
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,720
to see like how other people react

2014
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,920
to like the incomplete ideas that I've had.

2015
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,880
Well, I've given you a lot of reaction here.

2016
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,400
We've been talking for quite a while.

2017
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,320
I could talk to you all day,

2018
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,160
but I should probably let you get back to it.

2019
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,400
So, yeah, I mean, thank you so much for being here, Natalie.

2020
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,960
Where else, I mean, we're talking here on YouTube,

2021
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,560
which is the platform where you're at.

2022
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,480
So I think people will be able to find you,

2023
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,400
but where else can they find the rest of your work?

2024
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,160
You can find me on Twitter and on Instagram

2025
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,400
and Patreon of course,

2026
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,680
but, you know, watch my videos for a society if you like them.

2027
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,840
On all platforms, I'm just contra points.

2028
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:50,640
So that's, should be pretty easy.

2029
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,920
Well, thank you so much for being here.

2030
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,400
It's been such a thrill to talk to you.

2031
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,760
Yeah, thank you so much for having me.

2032
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:57,040
This was a great conversation.

2033
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,720
Well, thank you once again and Natalie Wynn
