00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me on the show

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,320
again. You know, the climate situation is very bad. In order to stop a laundry list of dire

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,360
consequences, we need to keep the rise in temperature to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,440
higher than pre-industrial times. And currently, we're on track for warming by almost 2.7 degrees

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:28,160
by 2100. Like I said, that is bad. And given this situation, given the stunning inaction we

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,600
have seen for decades, you could be forgiven for writing it all off and finding a nice hole to

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,320
bury yourself in as things get worse until you die. There's an attitude a lot of people have

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,440
right now that basically says the world is ending and there's nothing we can do about it. So let's

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,320
all give up. But guess what? That is not true. The world is not ending. It is going to exist

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,520
tomorrow, whether it's better or worse, and you are going to have to live in it. And personally,

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm too much of a fan of my life and of planet Earth itself to give up. I don't think it's an

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,880
environmental position to say, oh, we're fucked. There's nothing we can do because there is always

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,720
something we can do. The problem is figuring out what that is. And to answer that question,

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,440
we need to understand clearly where we are, how we got here, and just what is actually possible.

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,400
It's not about optimism and it's not about pessimism. It's about understanding the reality

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,480
of the world we live in and what we can actually do about it. And you know what?

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,160
The best cure for despair is to grab a shovel and pitch the fuck in. And our guest today

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,800
is going to help us do that. She is deep in the weeds on all of the data and she has written

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,640
a deeply data-informed book that we can use as a baseline to help us attack the challenges we face

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,560
in creating a sustainable future. But before we get into it, I just want to remind you

28
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,920
researcher and deputy editor of the indispensable website Our World in Data, a researcher in

29
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,720
global development at Oxford. And she's the author of the new book, Not the End of the World,

30

How We Can Be the First Generation to Build a Sustainable Planet.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,280
I know you're going to love this conversation. Please welcome Dr. Hannah Richie.

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,080
Hannah, thank you so much for being on the show.

33
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,720
No, thanks very much for having me. Looking forward to the conversation.

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,880
Yeah. So you have a new book out called Not the End of the World. We're at a time where

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,600
so many people talk about the world that we live in as though it's about to end.

36
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,680
Oh, who knows if there'll even be another presidential election? Oh, who knows if

37
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,840
a retirement? Oh, the world's not even going to be around that long. We have this fatalism

38
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,400
about almost everything, which is, I think, a very odd viewpoint to have.

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,720
It's a very interesting thing about our time that so many people feel that way.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,840
But it really seems to stem, first of all, from the climate crisis that we've, you know,

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,160
I was brought up knowing, you know, watching kids' cartoons about how climate change is

42
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,080
coming and we're ruining the planet and we have to do something. And then for the last,

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,360
you know, 30 plus years of my life, I've watched very little be done.

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,880
And so I understand why people would say, OK, well, that means we're screwed because I was

45
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,240
told about this crisis as a kid and we're still not doing as much as we should be. And therefore,

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,600
you know, we're going to be a member of the last generation, you hear people say.

47
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,480
You have a new book out called Not the End of the World, which takes the opposite viewpoint

48
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,600
in its title. I love that. Tell me about it. Why do you have that view, that it's not the end of

49
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,240
the world? Yeah, I mean, the title is called Not the End of the World. And I think it matters how

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,880
you say it. I mean, the book tackles seven big environmental problems, like I think climate

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,000
change is the big one that we think of, but we face a range of other big environmental problems

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,320
as well. And I think the title is not, you know, oh, it's not the end of the world. This is not a

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,600
big deal. No, it's a definitive, these are massive problems, but we're going to make sure that this

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,400
is not the end of the world because there are solvable problems. I mean, if we, even if we just

55
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,960
focus on the issue of climate change, I think, you know, coming from an environmental background,

56
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,520
working in this area for years, and, you know, also speaking to other climate scientists in this

57
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,640
area feels like we've done a very fast 180 from, you know, not that long ago, you know, the discussion

58
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,360
around this was, you know, is it actually happening? Are humans actually causing it? We seem to have

59
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,840
done like a 180 towards, oh, it's too late and now there's nothing we can do. And I think, you know,

60
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,520
I think we're kind of suffering from this kind of whiplash of, you know, what happened in the last

61
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,280
five to 10 years that we've done a complete 180 from almost semi-denial to it's too late and there's

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,080
nothing we can do. So, you know, what I try to do in the book is lay out, yes, these are, you know,

63
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,200
massive and urgent problems. And if we don't get our act together, the consequences will be really,

64
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,640
really catastrophic. But there is someone we can do about it. And although we aren't making progress

65
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,800
as fast as we would want, and we're not on track for where we need to be, we are actually making

66
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,040
progress. And we can massively accelerate that if we make the right decisions now.

67
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you think the view that it's too late, there's nothing we can do about it, is that, you know,

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,800
another form of climate denialism? You say we've made a 180 from, oh, we're not doing it at all to

69
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,480
it's too late. Is that just the new form of climate change denialism?

70
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,200
I mean, I think, I mean, I think maybe some people try to push that message because they

71
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,600
they think that it's helpful for the kind of climate denial message. I mean, I think for some

72
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,800
people that's not their motivation. I think they generally just feel, you know, paralyzed and helpless

73
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,160
in the massive problem. So I don't think it comes from the same place. I think the actions or the

74
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,920
outcomes are very similar, right? Both extremes of it's not a problem or it's too late to do

75
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,120
anything about it. Both lead to the outcome of inaction, right? They both lead us to, you know,

76
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,880
what on one side you don't take action because there's not a problem to deal with in the first

77
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,120
place. At the other extreme, you don't take action because it's pointless. And if we're screwed,

78
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,280
then what's the point of doing anything anyway? So I think the outcomes of these two extremes

79
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,240
can be the same even if the intent behind them is not.

80
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,280
Yeah. So you say we are making progress. What are examples of that? Let's try to front load the

81
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,760
podcast episode with some good news. How about that? What is a reason for an optimistic viewpoint?

82
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,560
So I think if you look at the trajectory we're currently on on climate change, it's not where

83
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,960
we need to be. Like we're on track for between two and a half to three degrees of warming. Now,

84
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,360
that's way above our 1.5 degrees or two degrees target. But if you are looking at where we were

85
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,760
talking about where we were headed a decade ago, you know, it was three and a half to four degrees.

86
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,120
So that's like a degree lower than trajectory we thought we were on a decade ago. Now, it's where

87
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,240
we are is not acceptable. But if we can make that progress in a decade, why can we not make more

88
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,840
progress to pull two and a half degrees down to two degrees? So I think there is a bit of a good

89
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,880
news story there. I mean, I think the most dramatic and positive change for me has been that if you

90
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,480
look a decade ago, I was really pessimistic about where we were, because if you looked at any of the

91
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,280
solutions we need to tackle climate change, I mean, fundamentally is we need to move away from

92
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,840
fossil fuels to low carbon energy. The problem a decade ago is that the forms of low carbon

93
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,680
energy we had were way more expensive than fossil fuels. So no one was going to deploy this at scale

94
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,600
because it was way, way too expensive. Over the last 10 years or so, you know, the price of solar

95
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,720
has fallen by 90 percent, the price of wind has fallen by 70 percent, the price of batteries and

96
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,720
electric vehicles has fallen by about 90 percent, which means that the low carbon energy sources

97
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,080
we need are now cheaper than fossil fuels. So you don't no longer have this, you know, this tradeoff

98
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,760
of, you know, should we sacrifice the economy to tackle climate change? Because they're now aligned.

99
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,600
It's actually just in our short term economic interest as well to go for the low carbon option.

100
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,000
And I think for me, that's been the most dramatic change and the most dramatic progress we've made.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,920
Now it's really about building the stuff, right? We've pulled the prices down.

102
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,800
Now it's about building this stuff out as quickly as we can.

103
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,120
What I think is interesting about the answer, and you hear that a lot from,

104
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,320
you know, folks who are really following what's happening with the climate, that the price of

105
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,400
renewable or non-fossil fuel energy has gone down so much, that's hugely good news.

106
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,200
What I think is interesting about that is it really is relying on, you know, the market,

107
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,880
on capitalism, right? The price is low and therefore the good thing is going to happen.

108
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,200
I guess what I'm curious about is what is our ability to do things that the market does not

109
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,880
demand? You know, for instance, if I look at transportation here in the U.S., let me just

110
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,760
give you a pessimistic case or a pessimistic example. You know, a huge amount of our emissions

111
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,400
come from transportation. And a huge of that is because of, you know, single occupancy,

112
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,240
passenger cars, people driving two and four in these giant pieces of metal. And, you know,

113
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,480
if we had, for instance, you know, massively expanded public transportation in the United

114
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:26,480
States, high-speed rail, passenger rail, you know, subways, etc., even just increased buses,

115
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,720
we could massively reduce emissions. But instead, we're putting all of our change

116
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,520
into electric vehicles, which are a marginal improvement. We're changing the engine of the car,

117
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,040
right? And we're pushing the emissions to the power plant. But that'll be an improvement.

118
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:49,200
However, even that has stalled in the last year because, A, the government has not built a massive

119
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,640
series of electric vehicle chargers everywhere. But B, you know, the car industry is kind of like,

120
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,680
ah, sure looks like consumers love the giant gas guzzling SUVs. That's what they prefer to buy.

121
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,080
And who are we to tell them to buy something different? People want to buy giant, people

122
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,320
don't even want small electric cars. When they're buying electric cars, they're buying fucking huge

123
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,760
ones that, like, take massively more energy to move around, massively more energy to build, etc.

124
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,240
And so, you know, reducing the price and hoping, all right, if we just make the slip go in the

125
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
right direction, all the water will run the right way and we'll be moving in the right direction.

126
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,120
That's great. But it also seems there, we have to have an ability to do things that are,

127
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,760
that are counter to what is cheap and available, right? And do we have the ability to do that?

128
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,160
I know that's a big question to land on you early in the podcast, but it's,

129
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,800
it's what you made me think of. No, it's, and I largely agree with you. I think there's a couple

130
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,080
of points there. I think I disagree that an electric car is just like a marginal improvement on a

131
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,080
petrol or diesel one. I mean, even a big electric car, if you look at, I mean, what's, what, there's

132
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,800
always a debate of, is an electric car actually better on carbon than a petrol or diesel? I

133
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,600
think what's true there is that the manufacturing of the car emits more carbon, right? Because it

134
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,720
takes more energy to build the battery than you would have on a petrol or diesel car. But once

135
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,240
you start driving it, the, you, you pay off the carbon debt very quickly. So in the UK, for example,

136
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,000
it pays off within two years for the average driver. And then from then on, the carbon emissions of the

137
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
car are much lower. So you're talking about like a too far, up to too far reduction. And as, and

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,640
that's great, but I do just want to toss in that almost everyone I know in the United States buys

139
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,600
a new car every three years. So if you're paying it back in two years, or at least they're on a

140
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,280
lease where they renew it every three years, so there, there's that still, still that consumer

141
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:45,920
behavior problem. But please keep going. I think on that, but I think the, I'm free years seems

142
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,040
very, very short. I mean, I think most people in the UK, at least by secondhand cars, I mean,

143
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,480
the key point is that if they're buying a new car, their car they're selling will go to someone else

144
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,480
that will be might be replacing a petrol or diesel car. So I think at the system level, it'll be

145
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,680
better. If you look at the emissions of an electric car, you know, you're talking about

146
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,040
around a too farge reduction in emissions. And actually that will get better over time, right?

147
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,640
Countries are decarbonizing the electricity grid so that, you know, by hopefully by 2035, for

148
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,680
example, actually the running emissions of your electric car might be zero because the US has

149
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,200
decarbonized its electricity grid. But I take your point that I think, you know, just leaving this

150
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,760
for the markets to run, you know, won't get us there. I think what's also really key is the

151
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,880
time scale on which this is needed. I think, I think the economics of the energy transition

152
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,080
are now just so good that, you know, we would just do this anyway, but we might do this over 60 or

153
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,280
70 years and we don't have 60 or 70 years. We need to do this in a much faster timeframe,

154
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,480
which means you do need to combine, you know, take the advantages of the free market economics,

155
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,000
but also impose policy on top of that. I mean, even if you're looking at the really dramatic

156
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,760
declines in the prices of solar, for example, over the last 10 or 15 years, they were initially

157
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:12,000
pushed by policy, right? Some countries very early on, you know, set up R&D, set up, you know,

158
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,920
it schemes to do this at a very high cost. And that has been like the first, you know, push

159
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,080
that we needed in order to get these emissions out. So I think you do need this combination of

160
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,840
policy to put, you know, accelerate these timescales. And you can also take advantage of

161
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:37,440
the free market economics of it as well. I really appreciate you pushing back my rant about cars

162
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,120
with the data that you have. And that was what I was hoping you would do, because, you know,

163
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,440
I think you sort of, I found a little bit of my own built-in pessimism and I loved the way that

164
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,680
you spoke to it. Do you often get a lot of pushback when you are spreading these messages?

165
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,600
Is there a way in which, you know, the people that you're talking to, myself included,

166
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,520
sometimes seem like we almost want to be pessimistic about this topic? Like we have a,

167
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,880
maybe a built-in cynicism about it? A little bit. I think what I sometimes find is that

168
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,200
for every solution we come up with, there's a, yes, but there's always a counter of like,

169
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,880
why that solution won't work or why that solution is not good. And I think that's very healthy.

170
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,960
Like I think if we want to find good solutions, we need to be highly critical of them.

171
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,280
Right. We need to work out what is the good solution, what's effective, what's not effective.

172
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,240
So we're putting our priorities and money and investment in the right places. So I think we

173
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,600
really need this kind of critical lens to these solutions. I think what, I think for me of what's

174
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,440
really critical in this energy transition and tackling climate change is that I think we're

175
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,680
always hunting for the absolute perfect solution. We're looking for the solution that has no land

176
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,760
juice, no minerals, and that's zero carbon. You know, there's zero negative impacts whatsoever.

177
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,480
And I think the reality is that those solutions just don't exist. What we're looking for,

178
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,240
and we need to do this quickly, we need to move away from fossil fuels quickly. So what we're

179
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,080
looking for are solutions that are orders of magnitude better than fossil fuels. And we're

180
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,480
having them, we have them, and we're developing them. And we need to work on the downsides of

181
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,520
those and make sure we're not creating more damage by the solutions that we're bringing in.

182
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,480
I think if we are to wait for the absolute perfect solution to come along, we'll just maintain our

183
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,080
the state's quo, right? We'll just keep burning fossil fuels, and we won't be willing to move

184
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,640
to anything else. I think we need to get a bit of the balance there where we acknowledge the

185
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:43,040
downsides to some of these other technologies or other alternatives, but we try to make the most

186
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,200
of them and we go for this transition anyway. I think that's a really good point. And it's

187
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,480
something I think about a lot is when we are trying to change the world for the better,

188
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,560
not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good, but while at the same time, maintaining a little

189
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,040
bit of skepticism and criticality, because there are also folks who will sell a solution as being

190
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,800
better than it is when we could be asking for a little bit more. And that's why, look, I'm a

191
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,000
transportation wonk, I care about that a lot. And in my view, if we're rethinking, especially the US's

192
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,280
transportation system, if we only change the engines that are in the vehicles, that's a missed

193
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,000
opportunity because there's a much bigger win to be had. There's a better society to be built,

194
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,600
and we shouldn't expect, we shouldn't accept, hey, there's a lot of people who want to sell us

195
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,080
a bunch of fancy new cars. And if we do more, we will have an even better outcome. But at the same

196
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,480
time, I'm not one of those people who's like, ah, it costs a lot of carbon to build the battery,

197
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,160
so fuck it. I don't think there's a medium to be found there. I don't think everyone should go out

198
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,160
and buy a brand new electric car every three years. I think that's excessive. But I do think, hey,

199
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,320
if you can get a used electric car and you've driven your previous car into the ground and it's

200
00:16:52,320 --> 00:17:02,000
time to go ahead, et cetera, there is that medium. I'm very curious, though, you talk about how we

201
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,480
need to find new forms of energy that are many orders of magnitude better than fossil fuels.

202
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,400
There are some who would say, well, what if instead of finding a great new form of energy,

203
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,680
what if we cut back? What if we just didn't waste so much? What if we didn't use so much? What if we

204
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,080
didn't insist on so much growth, et cetera? This is sort of the degrowth movement. There's a lot

205
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:31,360
of folks who have that sort of perspective, what if rather than more, we had less? And I'm curious

206
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,280
what you think about that point of view. I mean, I think there is some room for that. I think

207
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,760
where I'm skeptical is, I mean, trying to convince people to do that is very, very difficult.

208
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,800
And I think we would struggle with that type of message. I mean, to come back to the policy

209
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,760
point earlier, of course, there are things that you could do to put a cap on what we would consider

210
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:03,280
a very excessive consumption. If massive SUVs are a problem, tax really big SUVs. If really

211
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,400
frequent flying is a challenge, then set a tax on really frequent flying. I think you need to

212
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,960
be quite careful with those policies that you don't get lots of pushback. You might get pushback

213
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,760
if you were to put high tax on the first flight that someone takes in a given year.

214
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,920
But you might be able to do it at much higher levels of consumption. Someone's fifth flight

215
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:31,440
of the year, you start to put high tax on. I'm a stand-up comedian. I fly, I take maybe 40 flights

216
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,640
a year. That was that last year. I easily am on the highest level of frequent flyer loyalty bonuses

217
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,840
because it's what I do for a living. And you know what? I think I would be okay being taxed

218
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,320
on that because I'm doing it to make money. That's how I make a living. And if I'm using the system

219
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,840
that much, I would be happy if I knew that some amount of money that I was spending was going

220
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,840
towards ameliorating the climate harms of the flying. But you're right. I cannot just say,

221
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,080
hey, what if I cut back in flying a little bit? Because it's literally how I make a living.

222
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,000
And I think a lot of folks are in the same situation. It's very difficult to ask people,

223
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,600
hey, what if you just cut back? What if we all just cut back and have smaller lives

224
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,240
where we're less prosperous, having less fun, enjoying life less? That's just sort of not a

225
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,720
great pitch to people for how to solve a problem. Yeah, I don't think it's a great pitch. And I

226
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,640
think if that's going to be your message, I don't think we'll get very far, very quickly.

227
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,320
I mean, I'm not against the reductions in what we make called excess consumption. I think there

228
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,240
are potential ways to do that. I think what would be difficult is how do we agree on what a

229
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,360
level of what excessive is, right? What excessive is to you is not the same as what excessive is

230
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,880
to me. I think there is another key part of this, which is that if we want to reduce energy

231
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,960
consumption, a really good way to do that is just to decarbonise. I think we can talk about

232
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,800
behaviour change and that's fine. But I think we're also underestimating how much we can reduce

233
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,720
energy use just by getting rid of fossil fuels and by electrifying our energy systems. So if you

234
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,640
look at, you know, if you blow up like a diagram of the US energy system today from like the fossil

235
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,320
fuels that are burned and where that actually goes towards providing people what we call energy

236
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,160
services. So that's like heating your home or lighting your home or, you know, the wheels turning

237
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,840
in your car. The majority of that energy is wasted along the way. And that's because when you burn

238
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,120
fossil fuels, most of it goes to waste heat. It doesn't actually go towards, you know, actually

239
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,640
giving you the power that you need. Right. Which means that if you were to take fossil fuels out

240
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,120
of the system, you would get rid of a lot of the energy use without taking anything away from the

241
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,320
energy services or the final consumption. So your behaviours could stay exactly the same

242
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,440
if you wanted to, but you would need much, much less energy in the system. And that just comes

243
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,080
from getting rid of fossil fuels and then electrifying stuff like transport, for example.

244
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,800
So if you take your gasoline car, for every dollar of gasoline you put in it,

245
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,840
only 20 cents actually goes towards turning the wheels and moving you. The other 80 cents is just

246
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,560
wasted. Whereas an electric car is almost the opposite. So every dollar of electricity you put

247
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:30,720
in, only 20 cents is wasted. And around 80 cents goes towards turning the wheels. So actually to

248
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,240
drive the same distance in an electric car of the same size, you might need three to four times less

249
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,920
energy. So your behaviour hasn't changed, but you've actually massively reduced your energy

250
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,560
consumption. So I think we also underestimate our ability to reduce energy use just by doing the

251
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,000
decarbonisation bit. And then you can talk about individual behaviour change as a way to also supplement

252
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,200
Okay, you're really smacking down my argument again about electric cars being a marginal

253
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,760
improvement. It's still marginal, but it's a very large margin. I absolutely grant you that.

254
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,280
And I agree. It's really important to look at where the actual waste is. If we're talking about

255
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,800
flying, rather than me flying around to make a living, we could look at, for instance, private

256
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:19,440
jets or that kind of thing. We could look at where the largest waste is. Maybe certain celebrities

257
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,200
don't need to take a 15 minute flight from one airport to another. They could take a goddamn cap,

258
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,720
you know, etc. You know, I got to confess, I have always been a sucker for Japanese treats. I love

259
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,520
going down a little Tokyo, heading to a convenience store and grabbing all those brightly coloured,

260
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,000
fun packaged boxes off of the shelf. But you know what? I don't get the chance to go down there

261
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,480
as often as I would like to. And that is why I am so thrilled that Bokksu, a Japanese snack

262
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,280
subscription box, chose to sponsor this episode. What's got me so excited about Bokksu is that

263
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,840
these aren't just your run-of-the-mill grocery store finds. Each box comes packed with 20 unique

264
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,120
snacks that you can only find in Japan itself. Plus, they throw in a handy guide filled with

265
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,200
info about each snack and about Japanese culture. And let me tell you something. You are going to

266
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,360
need that guide because this box comes with a lot of snacks. I just got this one today,

267
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,360
direct from Bokksu, and look at all of these things. We got some sort of seaweed snack here.

268
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,760
We've got a buttercream cookie. We've got a dolce. I'm going to have to read the guide to

269
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,000
figure out what this one is. It looks like some sort of sponge cake. Oh my gosh. This one is,

270
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,200
I think it's some kind of maybe fried banana chip. Let's try it out and see. Is that what it is?

271
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Nope. It's not banana. Maybe it's a cassava potato chip. I should have read the guide. Ah,

272
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,880
here they are. Iburigako smoky chips. Potato chips made with rice flour, providing a lighter

273
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,680
texture and satisfying crunch. Oh my gosh. This is so much fun. You got to get one of these for

274
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,400
themselves and get this for the month of March. Bokksu has a limited edition cherry blossom box

275
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,040
and 12 month subscribers get a free kimono style robe and get this while you're wearing your new

276
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,600
duds learning fascinating things about your tasty snacks. You can also rest assured that you have

277
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,200
helped to support small family run businesses in Japan because Bokksu works with 200 plus

278
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,760
small makers to get their snacks delivered straight to your door. So if all of that sounds good,

279
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,160
if you want a big box of delicious snacks like this for yourself, use the code factually for

280
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:23,040
$15 off your first order at Bokksu.com. That's code factually for $15 off your first order on Bokksu.com.

281
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,880
Okay. I want to talk about some of the other crises that you mentioned. I just want to ask

282
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,560
you one more question on this first about the price going down because there's also a phenomenon

283
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,200
when things get more efficient and the price goes down, we do tend to use more of them. I think about

284
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,720
LED lights, which are massively more efficient than every other form of light ever made,

285
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,680
but the result is that people are using, and businesses especially are using a lot more

286
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,240
LED lights because, hey, guess what? We can now have 10 times the lights for the same cost or

287
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:04,800
whatever. So why not leave them running all the time because they're just LEDs? Is that at all an

288
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,960
issue in, hey, the price of moving, the price of heating your home goes down, the price of lighting

289
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,360
goes down, the price of all these things go down? Does that just mean we'll use more of them, not less?

290
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,120
I think there's two angles to this. I think one angle is looking at a large part of the world

291
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,320
where a big constraint is just they cannot afford energy. People that don't have much heating or

292
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,160
lighting or air con, and actually just a big everyday struggle for them is, how do I get

293
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,320
access to energy? And for those people, a reduction in energy prices is a massive benefit. They might

294
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,760
get energy for the first time. They might get vital energy services that we have enjoyed for a long

295
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,520
time. So I think for them, low energy prices is just a benefit. And actually, we should be supportive

296
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,480
of the fact that their energy use might increase because it will mask the increase.

297
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,120
That is a great point. That's a great point. Thank you.

298
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,080
And then I think when we're talking about, for example, people in the US or the UK,

299
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,600
like richer countries, I think this effect that you describe is what we call the Jevons paradox,

300
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,840
whereas the price of something falls or as efficiency improves, you use more of it.

301
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,160
Now, there are a range of studies trying to look at how big this, we call it the rebound effect,

302
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,960
how big the rebound is. And most tend to find that there is some rebound, right? So you do

303
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,440
undo some of the improvements that you get in efficiency, for example, but they rarely rebound

304
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,160
more than 100%, right? So they might rebound 50%. So rather than getting the full 100% of the

305
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,760
efficiency gains, because you use more, you might only get 50%. So it's not as good as you might

306
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,680
initially expect just from the numbers, but it's often not so much that you use more energy

307
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:58,800
than you did before. So LEDs is a good example where people after getting LEDs, you did just use

308
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,680
more lights or you left them on or you might have installed more in your home. But actually,

309
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,800
energy use for lighting in the US has still gone down so that the rebound wasn't 100%,

310
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,760
but we did undo some of those gains because we use more.

311
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,880
Yeah. Well, and I was thinking about reading studies about light pollution that like light

312
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,160
pollution has, if you're an astronomer or someone who cares about bats,

313
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,280
like you might not be happy about LEDs because we're using more, but I'm glad to hear that the

314
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,320
energy use has gone down. I love knowing the name of that, the Jervins paradox. I hadn't heard

315
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:40,720
that before. Oh, Jevins. Yeah, Jevins paradox. That's really cool. This is great. I love that I

316
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,360
keep standing up these arguments for you and you keep knocking them down so ably. You're my

317
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,120
favorite kind of guest. You say that climate change is only one of many types of environmental

318
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,080
problem that we have facing us. What are some of the others?

319
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,800
I mean, I think another big one is air pollution where globally estimates, there are a range of

320
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,600
estimates of how many people die prematurely from air pollution every year, but they're all in the

321
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,000
millions. And the World Health Organization, for example, estimates that around 7 million premature

322
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
deaths every year from air pollution, which is a massive deal. And there's two problems of air

323
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,560
pollution there. One is what we call indoor air pollution. And that's people typically on much

324
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,840
lower incomes, where actually the only sources of energy they have are like wood or charcoal.

325
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,000
And they burn leaves in their home for heating or cooking fuels, and then they inhale the smoke.

326
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,920
And that's really, really bad for human health. So they have millions of deaths from that.

327
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,360
And then we have millions of deaths from outdoor air pollution. So that's stuff from our cars,

328
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,880
power plants, for example, industry. And again, millions of people die there prematurely every

329
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,360
year from that source of pollution. So for me, you were to quantify deaths from environmental

330
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,560
problems today, like air pollution would be very much top of the list. And it's something we

331
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,440
can have in the back of our mind, but don't really think about. Yeah. I mean, it's completely insane

332
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,080
that when we look at the toll of our energy system, it's one that we don't often keep in mind,

333
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,320
because it's sort of like an invisible death toll. Again, transportation causing emissions,

334
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,320
even if you just look at deaths from our transportation system, we think of car crashes,

335
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,120
people being hit by buses or whatever. We don't think about the number of people who

336
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,800
are dying of respiratory illnesses that they got because they live 800 feet from a freeway,

337
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,800
as many people do here in Los Angeles where I live. I mean, there's like some federal regulation

338
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,400
that says you're not supposed to build a home within X number of feet of a freeway.

339
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,640
And in Los Angeles, something like, I don't know, a huge percentage, like 40% of homes

340
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,600
are in violation of this because we have freeways everywhere. There's just so much air pollution.

341
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,440
And so people are dying left and right of respiratory diseases, but that doesn't hit the

342
00:29:53,440 --> 00:30:00,880
news. It doesn't say, hey, a five-year-old child with asthma killed or a person dies at 65 when

343
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,480
they would have died at 90 because of air pollution in the same way that a car crash does.

344
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,000
And yet, those deaths are caused by the same thing. Yeah, exactly. And I mean, this is another

345
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
what we call an externality of burning fossil fuels. And that works in the same way as climate.

346
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,160
The CO2 emissions and the damages from climate change are like an externality, a kind of cost to

347
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,200
society, a social cost and environmental cost that isn't factored into the price of fossil fuels

348
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,120
when you burn them. And it's the same for air pollution. That's exactly the same thing. This

349
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,920
is a kind of hidden externality that we just don't really think about. I mean, again, I like to

350
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,960
highlight that these problems are solvable problems. They're tractable problems. I mean,

351
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,120
if you were to look across a range of especially high-income countries, we have actually made

352
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,400
progress on reducing air pollution over the last few decades. The US Clean Air Act has been really

353
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,920
successful in reducing emissions of these gases. The same in the UK. We've seen a really rapid

354
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:10,560
decline. There's still an unacceptable number of people dying from this, but we can make progress

355
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,840
when we put the right policies in place and we make these transitions. I guess the key challenge

356
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,240
there is that most people dying from air pollution today live kind of in middle-income

357
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,280
countries that have industrialized very, very quickly, but they've done that by burning fuels,

358
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:32,080
especially very close to city centers. So Delhi, for example, Beijing was one where if you were to

359
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,400
go to Beijing a decade or so ago, really, really heavily polluted. Over the last decade, it's made

360
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:44,080
amazing progress in reducing air pollution and added years onto the lives of its citizens.

361
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,120
So I like to highlight that these are massive problems, but they are also tractable ones and

362
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,000
they are ones that we can make progress on. And what are some of the other environmental

363
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,520
challenges? I love hearing this. I love hearing a problem and then a solution right after it.

364
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,640
I mean, I think a big one is our food systems. I think people massively underestimate the

365
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,360
environmental impacts of our food systems. I mean, I think there's almost no environmental problem

366
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,800
where food isn't either a big player or completely dominates the impacts. I mean,

367
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:20,080
it contributes around between a quarter and a third of greenhouse gas emissions for climate change.

368
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,680
It's the leading driver of deforestation. It's the leading driver of biodiversity loss.

369
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,400
It's the biggest user of fresh water. I mean, I think when we think about fresh water,

370
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,240
we think about taking a shower or brushing our teeth. It's farming is the biggest user of water.

371
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,120
It's the leading driver of water pollution. So there's a really long list of environmental

372
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,240
problems where food and what we eat and how we produce it really sits at the center of that.

373
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:53,920
Yeah. And so how do we solve this? Because some people are watching this or listening to this

374
00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:00,320
going, vegan, we should all be vegan. And what a wonderful world that would be. And I've eaten

375
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:07,040
vegan for long periods for many times in my life. And yet I do not believe that we are going to solve

376
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:14,880
this problem by convincing every single person to go vegan one by one in the way that a religious

377
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,760
proselytizer might, that folks who are doing that are doing the Lord's work good on you. But I don't

378
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,520
think we're going to solve the problem that way. And I also think that eating organic,

379
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:31,040
eating local, small scale farms, very nice for folks who can afford it. But we need a system,

380
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,880
a food system that can feed what seven billion people at this point, eight billion we're on our

381
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,240
way to. Eight, excuse me, thank you. I always forget how many billions. Because when I was a kid,

382
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,280
let me just say, one of the fucking weirdest things in my entire life is I remember being in

383
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,800
high school and being told there are six billion people on earth. And then I remember 10 years

384
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,040
later, it was like, hey, now it's seven. And I was like, how there's a billion more people

385
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,280
when I was just like, you know, when I was like watching DVDs and, you know, like taking the

386
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:10,000
bus home from school, like how did what a massive change. And yet everything looks the same to me

387
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,280
when I'm walking down the street. It's bizarre. And now we're now we have eight. So we've added

388
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,440
a quarter as many people or third as many people has already existed when I was a kid.

389
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,080
In the last couple of decades, we got to feed all of them. So, you know, how the hell can we

390
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,480
have a food system that feeds these people food that they want to eat without destroying the environment?

391
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,840
So I think there's, I think there's two big solutions or things we need to do here.

392
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,040
I think the very first, the first one is we just, we need to produce food very, very efficiently.

393
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:47,840
And by that, we need high crop yields. Now, if you go back to, you know, the 1960s or the 1970s,

394
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,400
you know, the big crisis at that point, and what people were talking about was the world running

395
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,720
out of food, right? We saw this really rapid increase in the global population. And basically,

396
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,600
conclusion was, there's no way that we will be able to feed everyone. And then, you know, there

397
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:10,560
was the, the population bomb was the book that came out in 1968 by Paul R. Erlich. And that predicted,

398
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,280
you know, just, we're just going to have so many millions of people dying from famine and just

399
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,360
wouldn't be able to feed everyone. And that hasn't come true. And that hasn't come true because we

400
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:25,120
had what we call the Green Revolution, where we just see crop yields across the world just skyrocket.

401
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,520
You know, you're getting doubling, tripling, quadrupling of crop yields, which means that

402
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,240
despite having, you know, billions more people, the amount of food we produce per person has

403
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,800
still gone up. You know, we've seen a massive increase. I mean, going forward, that's also

404
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,680
really key. What happens if you increase crop yields is you obviously get more food. But the

405
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,280
key point is you, you grow it on less land, which means you need to cut down less forests. You need

406
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,040
to, you know, go into less wild habitats. You can, you can use much less land for farming. So that's

407
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,440
number one. And then number two is just, we just need to see massive global dietary change.

408
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,480
The biggest impact by far of our food systems is, is, is meat and dairy consumption. And we do need

409
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,400
to find a way of reducing that. But I, I completely agree with you that I think the, the message of

410
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,360
we just all need to go vegan tomorrow is just like not going to work. Yeah. And actually,

411
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,840
how do we, I'm fascinated to hear you say that then because I, I agree. I agree with both points,

412
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:31,120
right? And so how do we square that circle? How do we reduce, and by the way, in the last couple

413
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,960
years, there's been a huge amount of interest in meat replacement foods. There was like a brief

414
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,200
fad for them in the United States. For a couple of years, I was buying impossible burgers and

415
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,960
beyond burgers. And now I never want to eat one of those things for as long as I live. Like I,

416
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:54,240
I ate so many impossible burgers that I can like picture the taste like, and it repulses me at

417
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,800
this point. And, you know, God willing, they come up with a different version that, that tastes a

418
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,400
little different and is a little bit more of an actual replacement. But, you know, unfortunately,

419
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,800
that industry turned out to not have the results that it promised investors and the public. So

420
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,920
what, yeah, what do we do to reduce meat consumption if all those things we sort of

421
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,560
are agreed might not be the answer? I mean, I think the, I mean, I think I should say that I think,

422
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,920
I think food is way harder to tackle than energy. I think on energy, I think people,

423
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,360
for the most part, they just want, you know, cheap energy coming out of the socket, right? And if

424
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,400
you can provide that for them, they don't really care where it comes from. For food, people really

425
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,960
care about what they eat. And it's like a such a strong part of the identity and their freedom,

426
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,120
right? Try to tell someone what to eat and they will immediately push back, which is why I think

427
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,000
this is a much harder problem to tackle. Yeah. I mean, I think the, I mean, I think the key thing

428
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,440
there is trying to sell it to someone is all or nothing. Like you either eat meat or you don't

429
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,480
eat meat is not going to work, right? I think you need to find a way of reducing meat consumption

430
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,200
or giving people options to reduce meat consumption and starting there. And then they might progress

431
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,360
towards, you know, a more and more plant-based diet over time. I think you're not going to get that

432
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:15,040
overnight. I mean, I think for me, I think we will need to rely on solutions that produce

433
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,760
almost complete mimics of meat that we're currently eating. I guess I'm probably pretty

434
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,880
pessimistic that people just accept, you know, we'll just eat beans and lentils and that'll be fine.

435
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,800
I think for most people, they basically want a substitute for meat, which means we need to

436
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,440
produce meat without the animal. And there are innovations coming through on this. The problem

437
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,800
is that they are currently too expensive and we haven't scaled them yet. Are you correct?

438
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,240
Yeah. I've read accounts of the current state of lab-grown meat where they're like

439
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:51,280
sort of making like a lattice of animal cells, like very painstakingly in a lab and like one on

440
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,160
top of the other and like, okay, we've made the perfect artificial steak and it only costs

441
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:04,000
$100,000 a pound or whatever. It's like encouraging work, but it's not really close to market yet.

442
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,640
Is that right? Yeah. I mean, I think the costs are falling pretty rapidly still. I mean, yeah,

443
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,280
$100,000 would have been, you know, the price, you know, maybe a decade or so ago, but they've

444
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,720
fallen quite fast since then. And actually, I think on cost, they might be competitive,

445
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,160
you know, in the next five or so years. Really? I mean, the scalability will be the problem. It's

446
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,920
like how you then take that, you know, really fine, your created process and scale that up,

447
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,760
you know, to produce hundreds of millions of tons of meat. I mean, that will be the big problem

448
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,160
rather than the economics of it. Yeah. And we also have the problem with the food system of

449
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,920
people's health. I mean, as you say, since, you know, the population bomb was written in the last

450
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,440
50 years, there's been this enormous explosion of food production, which is great sort of

451
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,200
demographically, right? If you're looking at, okay, we produced enough food for all of these

452
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:03,040
8 billion people. But if you look at at least, you know, the dietary health of people in the

453
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,360
United States, it is poor. And you have to lay some of that at the feet of our food system.

454
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,840
It's not people need to make better choices. It's people need better choices in the supermarket.

455
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:19,360
The food that is being rammed down people's throats is not what it should be because of,

456
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,520
I would say the pressures of capitalism on these food producers to make food more cheaply and etc.

457
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,560
And so, you know, we have this explosion in the number of calories we're creating, but there

458
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,880
may be not the calories that are best for people's health. And I could imagine something similar

459
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,240
happening if we have our meat substituted, like we probably need, you know, some amount

460
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,120
of regulations in place or somebody thinking about like, let's make sure we shape this system

461
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,880
so that we're not producing, you know, we're feeding people and we're also not feeding them

462
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,080
shit, right? Yeah, no, I agree. I think the quality of the meat substitutes or, you know,

463
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:04,480
whatever we replace it with will be really important. And to some extent, that could be

464
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:12,400
another lever to encourage people to move away from particular products. Like I think as I was

465
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,440
saying, I think the transition in food is a much harder sell for people. But what people really

466
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,560
care about is their health. So if we can produce products that are one more environmentally friendly

467
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,320
and also better for people's health, that could be another lever to encourage people to make that

468
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,240
transition. I mean, I think there are a range of studies looking at, you know, the health benefits

469
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,000
of moving to a more plant-based diet doesn't necessarily mean a completely plant-based

470
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,080
diet, but a more plant-based diet. And they tend to result in slightly better health outcomes

471
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,280
for people. And that might not be because necessarily they're eating less meat. But I think

472
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,080
often when people transition to a more plant-based diet, they automatically increase the diversity

473
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,720
of foods that they're eating, right? Like they diversify different meals, they eat a bit more

474
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,000
veg, a bit more fruit, a bit more of various different foods. So overall, the quality of

475
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,640
their diet might improve and diversify. So I think that the health lens of this is also really,

476
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:16,160
really critical. Yeah. And when I think you can make the argument to people, hey, if you eat less

477
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,520
meat, if you diversify your diet, you're going to be healthier. That is an appealing message to

478
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:29,200
people, you know, people want to feel better about what they eat. And I think if we sort of

479
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:38,400
abandon the monkish devotion to, I never again shall meat pass my lips. And that's fine for those

480
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,920
who want to make that moral commitment. I think that's a wonderful moral commitment to make and

481
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,400
I support it. But if we can focus on reducing, diversifying for everybody in general, we can

482
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,800
make huge, huge gains without requiring people to, without requiring people to give up so much if

483
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,360
they don't want to. Is that sort of what it is? Yeah, exactly. I think for a lot of people,

484
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,440
even that first step would seem overwhelming. You know, how on earth do I eat a vegan diet?

485
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,040
Like what do I eat? And I actually think as you graduate, as people are gradually exposed

486
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,760
towards, you know, eating a bit less meat or substituting, you know, one meal, you know,

487
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,000
a day or a day a week for a more plant-based diet, they then start to learn stuff that they can eat.

488
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,640
And oh, I actually quite like this substitute or I like this different meal that I've made.

489
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,120
I think then they become more comfortable with it over time and might be able to take it further.

490
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,840
But I think the overwhelm initially of, okay, I suddenly have to eat a completely vegan diet,

491
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,680
you know, really puts people off. So I think we need to take people on baby steps along the way.

492
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,480
And then they might end up a vegan diet at the end of the road. But I think most people will not

493
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:53,200
jump immediately to that. Yeah. I mean, my own thing was like 10 years ago, I read a book by

494
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,400
the cookbook author, Mark Bitman, called Vegan Before Six, where he had, he's like,

495
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,240
here's my diet plan. I eat vegan before 6 p.m. and then I have whatever I want for dinner.

496
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,120
And I did that for a year or two. And then I just sort of learned, oh, here's a bunch of vegan

497
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:12,080
meals I can make myself. And so now I eat vegan quite often. Not, I'm not a permanent vegan,

498
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,240
but like, you know, more often than not, I'm like, oh, let me try to have a vegan meal today.

499
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,520
And I think getting that sort of muscle memory into people so that they know how to do it enables

500
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,760
them to make those choices, et cetera. Now, vegans in the comments, I know you're yelling,

501
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,840
everyone should just go vegan. It's fine. Like keep doing what you're doing. But we are trying to

502
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,560
get as many people under the tent as possible. And having a little bit of allowance for where

503
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,120
people are currently at, I think, helps us do that, right? Yeah, exactly. I mean, I've had this

504
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:50,640
dilemma myself. So I'm now a vegan. And I wasn't, you know, three years or so ago. And I've actually

505
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,480
questioned over the years, am I more effective in this role as a vegan, or as someone that's not a

506
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,040
vegan, but strongly encourages, you know, meat reduction? Like I sometimes have this kind of

507
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,240
block of if I, you know, people find out I'm a vegan, you know, they don't take my message

508
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,680
seriously, or they think I'm like way too extreme. Or, you know, they can't visualize how they would

509
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,040
get from where they are to where I am. Whereas if I was someone that, you know, didn't eat meat that

510
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,320
often, maybe didn't eat beef, ate some chicken or fish, they might find that more relatable. And

511
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:28,720
therefore they might actually feel like there was a shorter gap between where they are and where I am.

512
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,440
I mean, in the end, I just went vegan anyway. But I have questioned, you know, what's the most

513
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:40,480
effective, you know, communication strategy there or where to place yourself to reach a bigger cohort

514
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,080
of people? Yeah, it does. It is funny that if you're talking to a vegan, and you're feeling bad about

515
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:52,240
yourself, and then they reveal, I eat fish sometimes, and you're like, Oh, oh, thank God. Oh, okay,

516
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,080
all right, okay. So there's, there's some hope for me yet, you know, like it, it's just having,

517
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:04,000
having a little bit of flex, like makes people a little bit relieved. So I really love that

518
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,760
we're making progress in so many areas. I am curious, though, are there any areas where we're

519
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:16,000
putting a lot of effort into reducing our carbon emissions that are not so effective? That, you

520
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,640
know, are things that, you know, hey, we should direct our efforts elsewhere? Are there any

521
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,320
current initiatives that you are a skeptic about? I mean, I think the, I think on, on climate change

522
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,440
specifically, I mean, I think the, the issue there is that I think there's a lot of people that are

523
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,320
really well intentioned. They want to make a difference. They want to cut their carbon footprint,

524
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,880
but they don't have good information to base that on. And they often misplace their effort.

525
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,160
And the issue there is that they do the stuff that has a really tiny impact or sometimes a negative

526
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,280
impact. And then they miss the really big stuff. So when you look, for example, if you look at

527
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,280
surveys, you know, asking people, you know, what's the best thing you can do for the environment,

528
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,440
or the best thing you can do to cut your carbon footprint, they mentioned stuff like recycling,

529
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:05,440
or, you know, reusing a plastic bag or turning off the lights. And, and these are, you know,

530
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,240
fine to do, do them, but they're small in the magnitude of things. And actually they miss the

531
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:15,600
stuff, like adopting a more plant based diet, or, or they even miss stuff like, you know,

532
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,160
switching to the electric car. So they, they're focusing on the really tiny stuff and putting

533
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,120
effort in there, and then missing the really big stuff. And what I think was really key is if we're

534
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:30,240
to have a hope of tackling this, you know, we're past the stage of the little stuff, right? We need

535
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,080
to be focusing on the big stuff. So I think that's the issue that people have is also often

536
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,720
misplaced effort, when there's actually a list of, you know, maybe five big things that really

537
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:47,680
matter. And then the rest is more like a rounding error. Yeah. Well, recycling is such a contentious

538
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:54,400
one, because a lot of people have an awareness that, you know, recycling, at least how it's

539
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:02,480
practiced in the US is, in many ways, a bit of a PR attempt by the plastics industry to,

540
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,280
you know, distract from the waste that they caused. Hey, if we put that little triangle on

541
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,600
the thing and say it's recyclable, then people will think, Oh, it's not so bad to buy one,

542
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,760
and it'll remove the guilt from them. And then we'll shift the burden of being responsible

543
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,480
onto the consumer. Now, I don't, I believe all that is true. I know all that is true. I've,

544
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,640
I've studied it and done content on it myself. But that doesn't stop me from throwing all that

545
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,320
shit in the blue bin, blue bin, because, Hey, why not? If some of us being recycled, whatever,

546
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:35,040
I don't stress out about it too much. But I think that that breeds a cynicism in people that, Hey,

547
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,600
these solutions that we're being presented are capitalist schemes by people who are trying

548
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:46,080
to get us to buy more. And I don't know. I think that is what leads a lot of people to say, Oh,

549
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,640
we're never going to solve this problem unless we do something about our economic system overall,

550
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:56,240
that we change its structure. And, you know, that we have a rapacious economic system that is

551
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,920
gobbling everything up, that always wants more demands, endless growth, mines the planet for

552
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:09,040
resources, mines our labor to reduce it to its lowest possible cost, and is just, you know,

553
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,960
a fire that's consuming the planet until it's all gone. That's a very apocalyptic view. But I'm

554
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,560
curious what you think about, you know, our economic system itself and how it contributes to the

555
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:28,080
problem or if we can actually solve it under capitalism? I mean, I think that was a lot.

556
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,680
I like to give a lot at this point in the conversation. I'm sensing you're a big fan of

557
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,760
capitalism. No, I think, I think, I think those are all very valid points. I mean, I think it's

558
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,320
very fair to say that capitalism has got us into this mess. Release has played a massive role in

559
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:55,200
getting us into this mess. I think you can still make the argument that it can play some role in

560
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:01,520
getting us out of it now. Or at least another way I'd frame it is that to me, I'm not sure we have

561
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:09,280
a choice at this stage of trying to utilize some of the positives of capitalism, which, you know,

562
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,120
we discussed earlier, the kind of free market economics of energy costs and technological

563
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,320
change. I think that's like one benefit of this. There are obviously still massive downsides. The

564
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:28,720
question is, can you garner the benefits of the system, but also try to address and pull down

565
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:35,360
some of the downsides of the system? Right. To me, that seems more realistic than deciding,

566
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,520
we're just going to rip up the system and build a new one, especially on the timescales that we're

567
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,280
talking about here, right? We're talking about tackling this, you know, we need to really get

568
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,040
moving on. I mean, we should have got moving on this 20 years ago, but now we really need to get

569
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,320
moving on this. And we're talking about, you know, decarbonizing our electricity grids in the UK

570
00:50:52,320 --> 00:51:00,640
or the US in five to 10 years. And I'm skeptical that we can tear down an economic system and

571
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,000
build a new one on that timescale. Maybe if we're talking about this over 70 years, then we might

572
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,120
have a way of, you know, working on our economic system first, and then deciding how we tackle our

573
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,800
environmental problems later. So I think we, in some sense, are stuck in the economic system

574
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,600
that we're in. But that doesn't mean we need to accept all of the, all of the aspects of it,

575
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:26,400
or just accept it as the status quo. I think there are things we can do within that system

576
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,840
to, to utilize the benefits and try to push down some of the major downsides of it.

577
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,960
I agree with you entirely. I mean, I'm a critic of our economic system. And I agree that capitalism

578
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,880
has gotten us into this mess. And I'm a person who is constantly wanting to envision something

579
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:51,280
better. However, I don't think that we can, we have time to wait, you know, I don't think we

580
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,680
have time to say, Hey, let's, let's figure out the economic system first and then deal with climate

581
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,520
change. We can do both things at once. And, you know, we can be realists about the world that

582
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,480
we live in and try to make, you know, the changes that we need to make in that world under the

583
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:13,280
system that we're in, as we also try to envision a better system and, and build it. And, you know,

584
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,160
I do take issue when people say, Ah, that's, you know, as people are probably going to say in the

585
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,880
comments of this video when we posted on YouTube, capitalism did this, we need to uproot capitalism.

586
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,760
Yes. And we also need to, we need to actually solve the problem that we actually face in the

587
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,160
limited amount of time that we have. And it is not an either or a problem. It is an and, and,

588
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:41,520
and, and problem. So thank you so much for that. Yeah, I agree. And I think, I mean, I think the,

589
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,320
I think the argument is often, well, we're just going to take the current system,

590
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,200
energy system, for example, that we're in, and we're just solving it for a different one. And,

591
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,440
and it's just going to be just as bad, and it's going to be so as extractive as it was before.

592
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,280
And again, I think this comes a little bit back to these kinds of perfect solutions,

593
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,640
this hunt for perfect solutions. I mean, I think we need to be real realistic that, you know,

594
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,640
this is not about maintaining the status quo, but like this, the rebuilding our energy system is,

595
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,280
you know, the biggest, ultimately, one of the biggest challenges we're going to face. And we're

596
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,480
just going to see really dramatic changes here. So I don't think we should underestimate how,

597
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,400
you know, big this transformation is that we're asking even in the food system, right? We're

598
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,840
trying to completely transform our food system, completely transform our energy system or industry,

599
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:35,840
you know, transport systems. So these are really kind of revolutionary changes. I think we should

600
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,160
underplay that. But on the kind of extractive component, I think, you know, we're trying to move

601
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:45,520
away from a fossil fuel system, which is just take, take, take, right? When you extract fossil

602
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,400
fuels, you burn them, they're done, right? You need to extract more, you do this every, every year.

603
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,920
And there we're talking about, you know, extracting 15 billion tons of fossil fuels every year.

604
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,120
Now, we move to low carbon energy, for example, we will also need to extract minerals. That's

605
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,600
completely true. And we need to be conscious of the environmental impact of that. But what's key

606
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:10,400
is that we are talking about, you know, orders of magnitude, less minerals, you know, talking about

607
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:16,960
tens to hundreds of millions of tons compared to 15 billion tons of fossil fuels every single year.

608
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,160
I think the key point of this transition as well is that you don't need to extract this year after

609
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,960
year after year, right? You can start to then recycle those minerals, you know, at the end of

610
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,560
a solar panel's life for a wind turbine and put that back into the system. So we will need a ramp

611
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,720
up period initially, because we just need to build lots of new stuff. But we'll hopefully

612
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:42,560
reach a position where a lot of that can be recycled. And we get to more of a, you know, circular

613
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:47,760
economy approach that people discuss, rather than just an extractive take, take, take one.

614
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,800
Yeah. And what I love about that is that you're depicting us as taking a step towards the world

615
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,360
we want. If you're someone listening to or watching this podcast who says capitalism is

616
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:04,480
extractive and I, that's something I hate about it, well, you're describing an energy system that

617
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:10,880
is far less extractive, right, that is pulling less out of the earth, ultimately, especially if

618
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:18,400
we're able to, as you say, reuse some of the minerals that we extract. And so that is addressing

619
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,120
part of the problem that you are trying to address. We're not ripping out the whole thing and replacing

620
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:29,600
it in a day, but we are taking a step towards the world that we want, which I think is really

621
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,080
important. And we talk about many issues on this show, whether we're talking about the criminal

622
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,320
justice system, right? Some folks are prison abolitionists, police abolitionists. I'm like,

623
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:45,440
hey, I don't disagree with the world that you're envisioning. Let's take steps in the meantime

624
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:52,560
to build forms of justice that are alternatives to policing, so we can show people how it works

625
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:57,600
and reduce our reliance on a day-to-day basis, rather than just focusing on the far-off horizon.

626
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:02,640
We also need to take steps towards that world today under the system that we live in. And that's

627
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:10,000
what you're talking about doing, which is why I love it so much. Are you ever, though, like,

628
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:20,880
is there ever a pessimist bone in your body about it? Is there a world that you see us

629
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,120
possibly heading towards that you're trying to steer us away from? Because sometimes I do know

630
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:31,280
that the optimist's point of view, especially for a climate activist, it can be a little bit of a

631
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,440
strategic choice, right? We need to be optimistic in order to do these things, and therefore it

632
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:42,240
makes sense to take a strategy of optimism and not be public about the fear that's in the back

633
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:48,480
of your head of like, oh, what if we don't do these things, right? So are you still powered by fear

634
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,760
to some degree, or are you really like confident, hey, all of these great things are going to happen

635
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:00,000
if we all keep pulling? No, definitely. Like, the fear is still there. Like, I still lose a lot of

636
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:08,320
sleep over climate change. I guess I just try to balance that fear, and in some sense, anxiety

637
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:14,160
with also with the optimism that there is something we can do about it. Like, I'm very clear always on

638
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,560
my messaging and also in the book that, you know, the changes I describe in the book are not

639
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:24,560
inevitable in any way, right? I don't know if we will do it. I can't force us to do it, but they

640
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:29,440
are possible. And I think there's a massive opportunity there. And I think what we need at

641
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:36,880
the moment is a positive vision of the world we could live in as almost as a North Star. I think

642
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,800
there's a lot of the environmental messaging is almost built around damage limitation. And it's,

643
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,600
you know, you know, the world will inevitably be worse in the future. We just decide how bad it's

644
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:53,200
going to be. And I think actually we need a bit more of a positive vision of, no, actually, the

645
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,160
future can be better. It will not inevitably be better, but there is something better that we

646
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,680
can work towards. How do we go from where we are now to where we would want to be? So that's what

647
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:09,760
I try to do with my messaging is try to present, you know, a bit more of a positive vision of where

648
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,720
we're trying to go to, but also make clear that, you know, none of this inevitable. And, you know,

649
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,960
if we stay on our current path, you know, I'm very scared about what the future will look like,

650
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,080
because we're not on a good one. But I just have some level of optimism that we can get our act

651
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:29,360
together and bend that curve closer to, you know, the temperature changes that we want and are

652
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:35,520
achievable. So give me a little bit of that positive version of the or vision of the future,

653
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:42,560
right? Like paying us a little bit of a picture of, you know, here I am. Like I said, I, you know,

654
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,760
30 years ago, I was watching those cartoons, right? Captain Planet and whatnot. Today,

655
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,120
I'm in my 40s. I'm like, hey, we didn't do as much as I feel like we should have done.

656
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:59,600
But, you know, what is the world that I could live in when I'm 80 if we do all the things that

657
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,400
you say are possible? So if we, you know, get our act together and tackle this, you know, we won't,

658
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,600
I don't think we'll limit, you know, warming to 1.5 degrees. I think, you know, that's,

659
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:15,200
you know, a very laudable goal. But I think, you know, we have kind of left it too late to

660
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,480
achieve that. But I think the key point there is, you know, 1.5 degrees is not a cliff, right?

661
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:25,280
Like we are, we need to fight for temperature ranges above that because with each incremental

662
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,480
rising temperature, we increase risks. So I think 2 degrees is still within our grasp if we really

663
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,520
get our act together. So we could limit warming to below 2 degrees. We will see, you know, increased

664
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:41,440
impacts there, you know, but there are things that we can do to limit a lot of those impacts.

665
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:47,680
So we'll live in a world where hopefully the majority of the world have access to energy.

666
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,480
They have higher standards of living than they do today. Energy is very cheap.

667
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,840
We don't have these, you know, massive energy price shocks, you know, that we have in a fossil

668
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:03,600
fuel system because, you know, Putin invades Ukraine, like we've seen in the last few years.

669
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:10,560
So we have more stable and low energy prices. People who have access to the energy services

670
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:14,640
they need, you know, we have much more livable cities that aren't, you know, completely governed

671
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:20,720
by cars on the road. There are, you know, better communities where we can interact. You know, we

672
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:25,120
have cycle lanes, public transport, you know, people are walking, people can sit outdoors,

673
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:31,200
they can dine outdoors. We have clean air to breathe so people aren't dying from air pollution.

674
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,400
You know, we don't kill, you know, more than 70 billion animals every year for food, but we still

675
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:42,320
have, you know, really tasty nutritious diets. We've got zero deforestation because we've brought

676
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:48,640
that to an end. And we have, you know, these amazing wild landscapes coming back and wild

677
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:55,280
animals coming back. That is a beautiful vision. And you feel very confident that we can get there.

678
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:00,720
You at least feel optimistic that we can get there. Yeah, these goals are completely achievable.

679
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:06,240
Whether we do them is up to us. And I mean, us, you know, at a very large collective level,

680
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,680
but they're there for us. And I think the key point and what I try to communicate in my messaging

681
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:17,840
is that this transition is not a sacrifice. I mean, often this environmental stuff is posed as

682
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,720
a sacrifice. It's, you know, oh, we'll just have to cut back or we'll just have to sacrifice this

683
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:28,640
in order to preserve the future. And that's fine. Actually, that messaging is fine if that's the

684
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:34,080
correct, you know, notation and the correct idea and correct message there. And maybe we should

685
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,920
just sacrifice, but we actually don't need to sacrifice because the changes we're making are

686
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:43,680
opportunities. So we have opportunities in the short term and it also leads to good benefits

687
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:49,680
over the long term. And I think we need to reframe our messaging here away from, you know,

688
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:56,560
sacrifice towards one of opportunity and abundance. Yeah, that it's the classic scarcity

689
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:05,680
mentality versus abundance mentality that we do not have to have worse lives. We do not have to

690
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,640
live in a worse world in order to prevent these outcomes. Actually, everything will be better.

691
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:18,240
We will all have more, more healthy, more vibrant, more prosperous lives if we were to make this

692
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:24,640
transition. I also, I love the name of your book so much, not the end of the world because it is such

693
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:33,040
a deep philosophical thing that people think the world is ending. And like it's, it's not possible

694
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:39,120
for it to end, right? Like you are, unless you personally die, right, you are going to wake up

695
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:44,240
in a world that exists and it is going to be better or worse, you know, and you are going

696
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:49,840
to have to live in it and you have some amount of control. We all have some amount of control over

697
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:54,880
what that world is based on our actions today. And no matter how bad things are, we have the

698
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:01,040
opportunity to do something that is going to make the world that we're going to wake up in tomorrow

699
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:06,960
a little bit better, a little bit worse. And so when I think about it that way, it makes me realize

700
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:13,200
this mentality that like the world is ending is nothing but a cop-out. It's, it's, it's false and

701
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:20,400
all it does is absolve you fictionally of that, of that power. It takes power away from you to

702
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,760
say that about the world. Yeah, I think that's the high extreme again. If you, you know, tell yourself

703
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,920
that the world is doomed and it's too late to tackle these problems and it is the end of the

704
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,280
world, then yeah, your reaction to that is, well, if it's over, then, you know, why, why, why should

705
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,680
I take action anyway? You know, it won't make a difference. Maybe we should just, you know,

706
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,600
enjoy the remaining of our lives that we have left because nothing we do now is going to change

707
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:48,720
things. And that, again, I think that's a cop-out because that's just not the reality. And that

708
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,600
type of approach and that, you know, messaging is not going to get us to where we need to be. I

709
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:58,960
think we need to reframe our discussions around this of, yes, these are very serious problems.

710
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:03,760
For some people, these actually are existential problems. Like people will die. People are dying

711
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,320
from air pollution. People are dying from climate change and people will die from climate change.

712
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:15,120
So for some people, this is really an existential threat. But we have the capacity to reduce those

713
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:20,000
risks, to reduce those dangers and actually not just, you know, have this damage limitation

714
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,760
vision, but also a better vision of actually improving the world going forward rather than

715
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:32,320
just trying to stop some of the damage. Yeah. And I mean, once you start thinking about that way,

716
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:39,680
it makes you realize how big of an opportunity you have because it's sort of, you go from thinking,

717
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,320
ah, what can I do to fight climate change or to fight these problems to thinking, oh,

718
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:51,760
everything that I do can be a solution. You know, like, whether it's eating vegan or it's,

719
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,720
you know, getting the electric car or it's doing policy work or whatever, like every single thing

720
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:03,280
that you do is a move in the right direction if you choose for it to be. And it can be massively

721
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:08,400
empowering to think about it that way. Yeah, exactly. And I think the, as I was saying earlier, I

722
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,800
think, I mean, these are, you know, massive transitions that we're doing and they touch

723
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:18,320
on basically every sector, which means that, you know, regardless of, you know, what you're working

724
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:24,720
in or where you're working or what you're doing, you know, these issues are touching you and you

725
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:30,720
can have a positive impact on that. Like, I think we often think of what you can do in environmentalism

726
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:37,360
as just, you know, how do I reduce my carbon footprint? And that's fine. And I give recommendation

727
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:42,160
of how people can do that most effectively. But I think we should also be more ambitious about

728
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:47,120
that. You know, my contribution is not just going to be how do I limit my footprint as much as

729
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:52,000
possible. I actually want to offset that and more by the positive impacts that I make, whether it's,

730
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,920
you know, communicating to others, whether it's someone, you know, working in politics, working

731
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:04,000
in engineering or finance or, you know, we all play a role in trying to shift all of these systems

732
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,280
into a more sustainable path. And actually, you know, regardless of what you do, you're probably

733
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:17,760
hitting on those every day. Yes. And this is why I'm so against people putting themselves in a

734
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,360
position of powerlessness. And a lot of times when I'm arguing with what I think people are

735
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:25,120
going to write in the comments, it's me arguing with that. People say, oh, we can't do anything

736
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:31,280
because capitalism. No, you can do a hell of a lot. And it's not only your responsibility,

737
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:37,280
it's your opportunity to do so. And if you don't take it, you are, you're putting yourself in a

738
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,720
position you're declaring that you have no power when the opposite is true. I so appreciate you

739
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,760
coming on today to dispel some of my lingering pessimism and tell me why I'm wrong about it.

740
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,760
I absolutely loved it. The name of the book is not the end of the world. People can, of course,

741
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:58,160
get it at our special bookshop, factuallypod.com slash books. But where can people find you online,

742
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:04,720
Hannah? And how can they get involved in this fight? Yeah, so I, maybe one of the best places is

743
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:10,480
I work for a project called Our World in Data. And that's a website. And we have data and research

744
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,800
on not just climate change and environment, but what we frame as the world's largest problems.

745
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:19,360
So you can go on there and look at all the data to try to understand what's going on in the world.

746
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:23,360
It's an incredible resource. It's really an amazing site. People should go check it out,

747
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:30,320
Our World in Data. Yeah, I have a substack called Sustainability by Numbers, where I try to understand

748
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:35,600
these problems on environment and climate through numbers. So not about like gut feelings or, you

749
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:41,040
know, intuitions or anecdotes. We're actually looking at the data on electric vehicles, for example.

750
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,320
I was really going based on gut feelings and anecdotes. And so you bringing numbers was an

751
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:52,640
important corrective to that. I love that. Sustainability in Numbers. Yeah. And I think how

752
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,600
people can contribute this like in so many ways. I think there is the, you know, reducing your

753
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:03,200
personal carbon footprint bit, which is important. But I think much more wider than that. I think a key

754
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:07,600
one is just, you know, how do you contribute, you know, from your career, for example, a lot of people,

755
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,920
especially younger people are deciding, you know, what should I do with my life? If you're

756
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,960
interested in this area, there are so many areas that you can get involved and make a positive

757
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,000
difference, whether that's in engineering, whether that's becoming an electricity into, you know,

758
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,120
massively enhance the grid or install heat pumps, whether it's spreading the message

759
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:31,360
through art. I mean, there's so many ways that you can do this in a much more positive way.

760
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:37,200
And then obviously also really key to that is trying to influence politics. And as we discussed

761
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:42,160
markets, I think you also have an impact on the market by the stuff that you buy. When you're

762
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:46,080
buying an EV, you're signaling, you know, we're done with petrol and diesel cars.

763
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:51,600
The world is moving towards electric cars. I think we can also have an impact politically and

764
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,320
on our market systems. Thank you so much for coming on, Hannah. I can't thank you enough.
