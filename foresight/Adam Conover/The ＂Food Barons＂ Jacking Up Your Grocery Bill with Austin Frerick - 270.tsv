0	4480	Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me again. You know,
4480	9520	if you're like me, you like to eat. In fact, you have to eat or you'll die. And you might have
9520	14960	noticed that food has been getting a lot more expensive. Although inflation for food has slowed
14960	20240	relative to 2022, you have to remember that the effects of inflation are cumulative. And recent
20240	25440	numbers showed increased prices for everything from frozen juice to ground beef. Eating out is
25520	31280	more expensive than last year. And even vending machine prices are up. It sucks. Again, we all
31280	35760	have to eat. And for most of us, living off the grid and growing our own meat and potatoes is not
35760	41440	an option. So ideally, we'd have a world where different food companies compete to get us the
41440	48080	lowest price, right? Well, unfortunately, just as with industries like newspapers, internet advertising,
48080	54080	airlines and athletic shoes, that competition doesn't exist anymore at all. Instead, our food
54080	59600	system is run by monopolies. And those monopolies have the power to screw us, whether we're their
59600	64800	customers, their workers or citizens living in places where they exert unfair and undemocratic
64800	70160	influence over our lives. I mean, I can't believe I have to say this, but food is simply one of the
70160	76320	necessities of life, which means it's a bad thing that only a few people in this country have control
76320	82480	over that necessity. You simply cannot explain how we get our beef, pork, grain, how grocery stores
82480	87840	work, why prices are higher than ever without understanding the influence of these massive
87840	93200	and manipulative companies. And luckily on the show today, we have a guest who knows everything
93200	98800	about it. And not only that is from one of the very regions that produces our essential food
98800	104000	stuffs. He not only knows about this, he has lived it himself. And I cannot wait for you to hear this
104000	107600	interview. But before we get to it, I just want to remind you that if you want to support this show

138960	144720	policy. He's a fellow at Yale and he is born and currently lives in Iowa right here in the United
144720	150160	States. His fantastic new book is called Barons, Money, Power, and the Corruption of America's
150160	156880	Food Industry. Please welcome Austin Frarick. Austin, thank you so much for being on the show,
156880	161920	man. Thanks for having me on, Adam. Okay, so tell me, what is so fucked up about America's Food System?
162480	167120	How radical it's become. You have one man in Iowa as the most powerful political person in the state
167120	173440	and he does five million hogs a year. I mean, not alone. He does five million hogs a year.
173440	177760	What do you mean by he does them? That could mean a lot of things, some of which I don't want a picture.
177760	182800	Yes, so he owns, so he has about 7,000 workers and employees at this point. A lot of them are
182800	186800	contractors. You got to be careful with the word workers, but he owns five million hogs. He has
186800	191280	other people grow them, but he maintains the ownership as they grow them out. But his operation
191280	196560	produces five million hogs a year. And how much of the American pork supply is that?
196560	200000	So he's the fourth largest pork producer in America. Basically in my lifetime,
200000	203760	you've seen the hog family farmer die, where you have the 10 largest entities
203760	207600	do about 70% of the hog market, control it, including the largest owner of hogs is actually
207600	211680	Chinese multinational, Smithfield. Is there a reason you're saying, by the way, hogs and not pigs?
211680	213760	I'm just very curious. Oh, no, I use them interchangeably.
214400	220880	Okay, I was like, is pigs wrong? Should I not be saying pigs? Do I look like city folk if I'm
220880	227120	saying pigs? Okay. Well, and so why is that a problem to have that be so monopolized in
227120	231360	so few hands that one person is doing, you know, is doing so many hogs?
231360	235120	So let's just take hogs and I, so I open my book opens with a hog Baron, this hog guy.
236880	241440	I know, isn't that first of all, it's not so. I'm sorry. The hog Baron is just, what a great
241440	244960	image. It sounds like an anime character or something like that. I imagine a guy with like a
244960	249520	top hat and there's like a little snout on the front. He's got some goggles and he's like,
249520	253760	hello, I'm the hog Baron oink oink. Like that's, what a great guy.
253760	257680	You got to put a little bit more Florida on him. So my hog Baron has like a Florida twist to him.
259120	262720	First of all, I find this campy. That's kind of why I like this framework is it,
262720	268080	you don't feel powerlessness because it's so morally ridiculous. And this whole thing started
268080	272800	because of him. It literally was in a bar in Des Moines, 2018, where someone, a political person
272800	276320	was complaining. I didn't know at the time, but like Iowa doesn't have campaign contribution
276320	281280	limits. So he had given the governor $300,000 for her campaign. Wow. And the thing that caught
281280	285840	my eye was, it was not even that, it was, he has a home in the rich suburb of Des Moines,
285840	289440	he has a home down in Naples, Florida, which says something, but he has a private jet that he flies
289440	293520	back and forth between the two. Wow. And I was like, that's power. That is like that imagery
293520	298240	says everything. But how did Iowa fall apart in my lifetime? And how do I tell this bigger
298240	303200	structural story with this little like trashy Florida man? So there used to be such a thing
303200	310320	as a family hog farmer. Now we have a hog baron, but there used to be a hog peasant or a hog,
311200	317440	small landowner, right? A hog family farmer. Yeah. And now those people now are low wage
317440	320800	workers for this baron. And instead of like, you know, having a relationship with the animal,
320800	324640	your job now is about 10% of the pigs die inside these muddle sheds. So you're paid to go in their
324640	328960	hall at the dead bodies to throw them into a dumpster. Wow. I mean, that is, that is where we
328960	333680	are now. But that's also like for those people in erosion in the middle class, right? Because if
333680	340640	you previously, I assume, were a hog farmer, you had some ownership of some land, of the animals,
340640	345360	of your production pipeline. You were a producer selling to somebody. And I imagine that that
345360	349440	you're able to make more money that way than when you're just a surf working for the hog baron.
349440	352160	Yeah. And you're spending your money locally, you're paying taxes, you're sending your kids to
352160	356880	school, and that's all gone. You see the massive consolidation of power. And honestly, the guy's
356880	360640	probably taking his money down the floor to knowing how this game works. And what happens is
360640	366080	it's basically modern day sharecropping. It really comes from chicken. They call it chickenization
366080	370800	and it's happened across the food system and it happened to pork. He saw that coming where I kid
370800	374480	you not a century ago when they wrote the regulations to tackle the main monopolies in
374480	378160	response to Upton's and Clare's the jungle. When they wrote the regulations, they didn't write
378160	381440	chicken into it because there weren't commercial chicken slaughterhouses. You just butchered a
381440	386640	chicken in your backyard. So down south, corporations took that model to black farmers
386800	391040	that a sharecropping model plighted the chicken. And then what you see is USDA didn't step in
391040	394720	saying chicken, you can't behave that way. And you see the chickenization of everything else.
395760	399600	Wait, so let's get a little bit of a bird's eye view of the history of American food production
399600	404960	because you started talking about, you dropped so many little historical bombs there, sharecropping,
405920	412160	the regulations in the Upton Sinclair era. So take us to the moment before Upton Sinclair,
412160	417120	what did things look like? Why did the regulations come in and then what did we live in?
417120	421200	What world of food did we live in after those regulations up until the present day?
421200	424800	Yeah, so I think actually meatpacking is a single best way to like talk about all this stuff because
424800	429760	it shows what the system could be and how it all falls apart. But let me also first start with
429760	433760	the notion that I want to be very careful about romanticizing the past in the food system because
433760	439040	in the day it's rooted in genocide and slavery. Yeah. But we did make progress. We really did
439040	443760	and you saw the meatpacking where we as a society were mad and angry at what we saw in the jungle,
443760	448320	the meat quality we were getting, and we made policy choices to break up these meat companies,
448320	454640	to empower the workers, and they got power. That became a solid middle-class job. People on both
454640	458400	sides of my family did that for a living. And then what we've seen since the election of President
458400	463120	Reagan is systematic assault on that industry, massive consolidation, where even in my book,
463120	468480	I have a slaughtering baron, this super corrupt Brazilian family where I would actually argue
468480	472000	they're the closest thing to a criminal organization in modern-day corporate America.
472000	475360	Wow. Which is saying a lot, but they actually pled guilty to bribing their way to monopoly
475360	479920	level status. And I'm not talking campaign bribes. I'm talking bribery. But they're now the largest
479920	483200	meatpacker in America. They're the largest meatpacker in the world's ever seen. And that's why we
483200	488160	see rampant use of child labor. We see all these bad things we tackled. This regulatory system
488160	491760	collapsed and we shouldn't be shocked that robber barons are filling that void.
491760	497760	So you said members of your family did this kind of work in maybe not the good old days,
497760	503280	but decades ago and made a living that way. So what did their lives look like compared to what
503280	507520	it looks like now? Yeah, I mean, my grandfather. My grandfather was kind of like my idol. He worked
507520	513760	at a hog plant town, the old Wilson's. They bought a home out in the country. He had a little acreage
513760	517680	I grew up. That's kind of actually why I lived farming and gardening is I grew up working his
517680	526160	plot with him. He owns his house. And nowadays, I mean, just even where I live, a lot of immigrants
526160	530000	and they live in section 8 housing. They're usually Sudanese and they work at either in
530000	534800	Tame or Waterloo, Iowa. They live two or three families to a two bedroom. You know what I mean?
534800	538000	My grandfather could buy a house, lived American dream and now these people are barely getting
538000	542240	by and where they live is actually most highly impoverished school district, sorry, school,
542240	546800	elementary in the city. It's just, it says so much of where we've become and it's incredibly
546800	551840	dangerous. And you add the whole layer on top of it of a lot of these workers either undocumented
551840	555920	or on the marginal thing of there's just so much abuse going on that we just don't even know about.
556000	561040	So how did this transition take place? How do we go from the world that your grandfather lived
561040	565120	into the world that these folks now inhabit? I mean, I just think we're living in a second
565120	569840	gilded age, just another Lazi Farah thing. And it's such a simple thing, but I realized sitting
569840	574160	in a biz school class a few years ago, the goal of any corporate executive is monopoly.
575200	580720	Period. And so like, you saw what they did regulatory capture, you know, the election
580720	585040	of Reagan was such a game changer of just, I know you had Lena Conn on. I mean,
585040	590960	that's like to me, this best way of hope right now is we're, we're moving away from that model,
590960	596320	but it allowed massive consolidation to occur where my coffee Baron in my book is a secret
596320	601280	German family that now sells more coffee than Starbucks, but didn't even sell it being a coffee
601280	606960	in America till 2012. They bought Panera, Caribou coffee, Ironsigns Bagels, Burgers Bagels, Curie
606960	612480	Cups, Stumptown, Telegencia, Krispy Kreme, you name it. They bought all of the worst bagel chains
612480	616160	as a lifelong New Yorker. They bought all the bagel chains I would never fucking eat at.
616720	622080	In my life, they have spongy bagels. They, they toast every single one of them. And, and along
622080	626800	with all these other chains as well. So, sorry, go on, please. No, I was just laughing because
626800	630080	that's like a hot point in my marriage. My husband agrees with you. I love Panera Crunch,
630080	635440	Panera Bread, Semina Crunch Bagel. My husband's from New York City.
635440	639760	It's fine if you, you know, if you got to eat in a mall, it's completely fine. I get it. But yeah,
639760	642720	please, please go on. Like, how did, yeah, how did this occur?
643840	647520	Robert Bork. I mean, there's always going to be hatchet men for industry. I mean,
647520	650720	there's always going to be academics doing the bidding of the rich. And he basically
650720	654720	flipped America's antitrust laws upside down. We had all these guardrails. Like,
654720	658480	what the coffee bearing did could not have been done just a few decades ago. You couldn't come
658480	662880	in and roll up a competitive industry. But when these guardrails came away where they came
662880	667600	both with this kind of junk science where consumer welfare standards, what they call it,
667600	670720	where you can show that prices go lower. For consumers, you can buy a company.
670720	675040	You can hire any economist to produce those numbers. And so you see massive consolidation
675040	679040	in meat packing, in coffee, in grain, in all these different industries. I actually think
679040	684000	food is the most concentrated industry in America because it's that illusion of choice.
684000	687120	You know what I mean? Like, if you look at the peanut butter area, there's actually one company
687120	690960	has about a 60% market share in peanut butter, but they have all these different brands.
690960	696400	Wow. 60% market share in peanut butter. Like, so Laura Scutter is not a real person. That's
696400	700400	what you're telling me. She's just part of some bigger conglomerate. She's actually owned by that
700400	706560	company. I think it's Smuckers. Smuckers invented Laura Scutter. I thought her name
706560	711280	too conveniently rhymed with peanut butter. I was looking at Laura Scutter, peanut butter.
711280	715360	There's no way that this lady was like, you know what? My name sounds like peanut butter.
715360	719040	Let me start an independent peanut butter company. There's a fake lady. This is why my mom hates
719040	721760	grocery shopping with me because I love telling her these little factoids when we shop.
723520	726240	Yeah, in the same way. I think we would have a good time at the grocery store together
726240	729120	because we'd spend about three hours there and never buy anything. We'd just be pointing at stuff
729120	734320	going, oh, you know what's fucked up about this? About this maple syrup or whatever.
734320	738080	I mean, even my favorite is probably my favorite chapter right was the grocery chapter because
738080	742400	I love them. But I had a grocery guy tell me, you got to think of a grocery store as modern-day
742400	746720	mafioso capitalism because even the shelf space, there is so much shenanigans going on what you
746720	751120	see at the eye level, like the whole slotting fees, all these games going on. It's incredible.
751120	759920	Yeah. So what happens? I know about the consumer welfare standard. Robert Bork puts out a very
759920	767280	influential paper called I believe the Antitrust Paradox, making the argument that all the antitrust
767280	770640	enforcement that we had for decades and decades in America that broke up monopolies and made
770640	776480	sure monopolies couldn't form actually was bad and that we shouldn't be applying it. And instead,
776480	781760	we should only break up a monopoly when the price is going to go up for consumers. If the price goes
781760	786800	down, it's okay. Yes. And then that has the advantage of being very easy for judges to
786800	790720	adjudicate, right? You just get an economist before a judge and the economist says, oh,
790720	793920	here's some numbers that say the prices go down. Well, the judge isn't an economist.
793920	796880	They're listening to, they're like, oh, you're an economist. All right. So if you say the prices
796880	800800	go down, I guess they'll go down. That's good enough for me. I'm just some fucking judge and
800800	805840	bangs the gavel and they allow the mergers to go through. And that's happened in so many different
807040	811680	industries. It's happened in my industry, the entertainment industry, so many others. But 60%
811680	816880	of peanut butter or all these coffee chains, that's a huge amount of consolidation. That would be
816880	820480	illegal if not for the sea change and antitrust enforcement. It's actually probably higher than
820480	823760	60% because a lot of times they do the store label and you only know as usually when there's a
823760	829680	peanut recall. Okay. You're totally, I mean, when you're explaining that whole
830720	835360	Robert Bork framework is to me, that's the hallmark of this era is big words to hide. I mean,
835360	841040	you're using complex language to keep people out to really hide shenanigans like consumer
841040	844400	welfare at standard. Those words mean nothing, but they sound really smart and it plays into
844400	847840	people's intellectual insecurity because they don't want you to know what they're doing. That's
847840	852160	all that is. Yeah. The consumer welfare standard is like, oh, that sounds like a big important
852160	856960	legal doctrine that very important smart people came up with. And you shouldn't argue with it.
856960	861440	And it gives the decision, the era of legitimacy. When in fact, to what it's much simply, they're
861440	865760	just saying, hey, let's let the mergers go through. It's junk science, masking moral judgments.
865760	869200	In the day, how many logs one man should own? That's a moral question we should wrestle with
869200	872640	as a democracy. Excel can't tell you that answer, but we pretend to do it.
872640	876720	Well, so give me more examples about why this is such a big problem in food. Again,
876720	881600	I know this is a larger economic problem, but what makes it so bad in the food system?
881600	883680	The workers, the workers are the ones being squeezed here the most.
885200	889200	That, I mean, that is the one that shocks people the most. My book is My Berry Baron,
890080	897040	Driscoll's. Your Berry Baron. Oh, Driscoll's. Driscoll's is in. Driscoll's is in my supermarket.
897040	900560	I buy Driscoll's all the time. They sell one in three berries in America.
902240	907120	But they don't grow a single berry, Adam. They sell one in three berries, but they grow zero
907120	911920	berries. Is that what you said? Yes. Yes. How is that possible? Chicken. They chickenized the
911920	918720	berry industry. And it's like a combination of Silicon Valley meets chicken. So they took
918720	923840	the Silicon Valley model of owning the IP. So they own the IP of the berry and then they contract
923840	927760	out production. And part of that chapter is I wanted to tell people a lot of the produce you
927760	931520	consume now is moved offshore because of these trade agreements where you can exploit labor,
931520	935520	exploit the environment. So, you know what I mean? How can you compete on price against
935520	942480	a 12 year old picking berries in like Baja, Mexico? Okay. Now I have to dwell on the question of IP.
942480	946800	You said there's IP in the berries, intellectual property. Now I'm used to that in Hollywood,
946880	951600	right? Like Batman is IP, you know? And so if I want to write a Batman movie, well,
951600	955440	guess what? I got to get permission. And also I'm not that important as the screenwriter or
955440	959760	the director. Batman's the star, right? Even the actor isn't that important. So IP is a real problem
959760	966800	where I work. What is the IP for the berry? Is the IP the name Driscoll's? Is it the,
966800	971760	or is it the berry itself? What the fuck are you talking about? Both. Because they want a branded
971760	975520	product. I mean, Driscoll's is kind of the first branded produce thing. Like you can't think of
976000	982080	name a branded Apple company. You really can't. But on top of it, I can name Apple varieties.
982080	985200	You're right. I can't, and I know some of those are proprietary, but I can't name
985200	989520	a company. I can name Chiquita Banana. That's one that I can think of that's maybe older.
990320	995360	But the key thing is, it's really about durability. What's really fascinating about Driscoll's,
995360	998960	it's really, you almost kind of have to blame Walmart. Like Walmart is the king of kings
998960	1003200	and the creation of one robber baron makes other robber barons where Driscoll's saw the rise of
1003200	1008080	Walmart coming and realized Walmart wants one company to do four berries year round for 4,000
1008080	1013040	stores. And so that berry is not engineered for taste. So they patent, they make special types
1013040	1017280	of berries that either sometimes they're gone to Morocco, sometimes in Baja, sometimes in Chile,
1017280	1022480	but it's all about durability. How can you make that berry last as long as possible as it goes from
1022480	1026720	you know, Chile up to Vermont. Right. And those Driscoll's berries, like they taste
1027600	1033600	not great. I mean, you know, I was lucky enough, my parents gardened when I was a kid and we
1033600	1037200	would have strawberries fresh from the garden. They taste so strawberry either. Incredible,
1037200	1042160	you know, Driscoll's berries are like, you're like, I'm getting a, I'm getting a hint of strawberry.
1042160	1048720	I waft it, a wafting under my nose when I bite into this watery pink white berry, you know,
1048720	1054480	it's better than nothing. It's okay on corn flakes, but it's not like a berry berry. Right.
1054480	1058320	But that's the story of the food system is nothing tastes good anymore. I mean, that is like
1058320	1062560	writing this chapter, you know, I did a little tastings like, so I love milk, shocking.
1064720	1069200	Sorry, sorry, sorry. No, no, no, no, you look like a milk drinker. You look like a milk guy. I'm
1069200	1073040	a white boy from Iowa. Yeah, of course I'm gonna love my milk, but like inputs matter,
1073040	1076880	like inputs matter and like cow and pasture is going to make a very different tasting milk than
1076880	1081920	like an industrial cow inside a metal shed or in baker's field, you know, eating corn all day.
1081920	1086000	And that's a story across the food system. And on top of it, industry will love to say this makes
1086000	1090080	cheap food. That's not factually true. That's like maybe my favorite little factoid writing this
1090080	1093840	book is, oh, these are concentrated markets, concentrated markets, gouge, that's what they
1093840	1098320	do and we see rampant gouging across the food system. So we're paying more for garbage. Like
1098320	1103040	that is what blows my mind. Yeah, those just goes berries are not like cheap. They're still,
1103040	1107600	you know, berries are expensive to buy in the grocery store still. You don't get many, you know,
1107600	1111920	you pay, I don't know, like eight bucks a little tiny thing of blueberries last year,
1111920	1117280	you know, a smoothie and a half. You know, it's not, it's just like, I mean, but the thing is
1117280	1122880	this system is done by design. Like my maybe the hardest chapter, right? But one of my second
1122880	1128080	favorites is my farm by grain bearing chapter about the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill heavily
1128080	1132640	subsidizes grains. So it makes highly processed food cheap. But if you grow produce, you don't get
1132640	1137360	anything. And it also pushes people to grow grains and not produce. So it pushed produce
1137360	1142000	off the shore of America to other countries. And when supply chains get long, transparency
1142000	1145920	collapses. Like it's so stupid, but like part of the reason why I wrote that was I read an article
1145920	1151840	15 years ago where 70% of apple juice in America comes from China. Really? 70% of apple juice
1151840	1158480	in America comes from China. But I mean, American apple farming is still big. There's like America
1158560	1161840	makes a lot of apples. I get them in the grocery store. Many of them are good.
1162880	1166720	So why would the apple juice be produced in China when we're growing apples here?
1166720	1170640	Because then the biggest part of apples is labor. It's cheaper to hire someone over there,
1170640	1174480	ship liquid across the world. I mean, we still produce a lot of apples, but not as much as you
1174480	1178800	think. I mean, it's kind of, if you go to Trader Joe's, look at the back of every juice. You'll
1178800	1184160	notice a lot of them will say, Turkey, you know, pick your country. It's a labor component. It's
1184800	1189440	as we rave standards of living for farm workers here, it undermines, you know, it kind of pushes
1189440	1194240	people off. And even in Iowa, most of the orchards are gone that I grew up with, but they're not
1194240	1197200	subdivisions. They're just more corn and soybeans because that's where more of the subsidies are
1197200	1203200	going to. You know, and I've known for a while that we covered on my Netflix show the G word,
1203200	1207040	the fact that we subsidize certain foods and not others and that we subsidize these grains.
1208000	1212160	And the story that we presented is that it's somewhat of a historical accident that we
1212160	1218320	subsidize those particular grains as opposed to any other crops. And we don't subsidize healthy
1218320	1223200	fruits and vegetables. This is a very, it's a very simple story. We told it on television,
1223200	1228320	so it had to be sort of simple and quick. It's one I've read elsewhere. I did not realize that
1228320	1233520	that story though meant that we were, I thought we were just producing less vegetables, not that it
1233520	1239840	was getting pushed offshore. That's wild. Like if I'm buying broccoli or whatever, it's like more
1239840	1246080	likely now to come from a different country entirely. Yes. It took me a while to kind of,
1247200	1251360	I love, do you know what they're like census for people? Well, USA does its own agriculture
1251360	1256560	census and every seven years they do it. And you start pulling to the data and you just notice,
1256560	1260960	oh, there's some weird trend lines going on here. And even something simple as during the new deal,
1262000	1265360	one of the things they did, the workers progress administration is they commissioned state guides
1265360	1269680	they called them. I almost think of Wikipedia mixed with like travel. I was reading the Iowa one
1269680	1273360	and I was reading about all these different regional food productions. You're like, wait,
1273360	1278240	there used to be tons of peaches in Iowa. There used to be tons of onions. So food supply chains used
1278240	1283040	to be much more regional. And part of it is, to be fair, part of it is refrigeration. Refrigeration
1283040	1288000	was a game changer. It extended supply chains. But what this system does is it really pushes
1288000	1293120	people to specialize, but it makes them incredibly fragile. So like that's what happens is like you
1293120	1297360	used to just see like Del Mar Peninsula used to do a lot of the produce for the East Coast.
1297360	1301760	The Delta used to do some produce for the South. Now, ever all your strawberries in America used to
1301760	1305040	come from California. Well, now it's starting to shift away to Baja. You know what I mean? Like
1305040	1307840	California is increasingly nuts because that's just pure capital intensive.
1307840	1312240	Right. Like, sorry, when you say California is nuts, you're not referring to the craziness of
1312240	1318480	life in California, which I can vouch to. Let me be clear. Things are pretty wild here in the state
1318560	1323200	of which I live. Now, you're talking about in California, which is a huge agricultural state,
1323200	1329200	they are now mostly growing nuts. And part of that is because nuts are easily like financialized.
1329200	1332640	Like you can ship them really easily. They're worth a lot of money. Like almonds are very,
1332640	1338560	they're calorie dense. They are also money dense per unit of almond, right? Yep, totally. And then
1338560	1341600	it's easy to harvest. You don't really need people. They just have machines that can do a lot of the
1341600	1345920	work. So you don't need to pay someone to go up there and pull down the fruit. But that means
1345920	1351840	that a state like mine that used to have used farming used to be a big part of its economy
1351840	1356800	that people actually worked in. And that there's the famous farm worker unionization efforts of
1356800	1363040	the last century. Like it's part of the history of the state, the fucking dust bowl migration,
1363040	1368720	all this shit. This is like part of what California is. Now it's just the same amount of land,
1368720	1373840	but it's being used with these giant machines to farm almonds just for a couple of people to
1373840	1377200	profit at the top rather than something that's benefiting everybody in the economy. Yeah, in
1377200	1381600	California, speaking of nuts, so it's just, it's a different food system. And it took me as a
1381600	1386000	Midwesterner a while to get my head around. Like there's a lot of problems with like the
1386000	1390240	homestead act and stuff, but it established like de concentrated power, especially in land holdings.
1390240	1394720	California, on the other hand, has always been colonial. Like you drive the central valleys,
1394720	1400480	you don't see farmhouses in the fields. And like, right, you start, I mean, you write a book like
1400480	1403600	this, there's so much stuff that ends up in the cutting room floor. I got obsessed with the water
1403600	1408240	stuff in California. Like the whole Imperial Valley makes no sense to me. Yeah, I mean,
1409120	1415920	yeah, it's crazy the way water has been redirected across the state, specifically to the in the most
1415920	1420720	popular state in the country. And by the way, I live in the most populous county in the country
1420720	1426080	as well, which is enormously thirsty of water, constantly in a drought state. But part of that
1426080	1431440	is because so much the water is directed to these farms that are owned again by one or two people
1431440	1437600	as their sort of personal wealth creation. Do you cover the, you cover the Resnicks in the book?
1437600	1442400	So I knew you're going to say that. I have a whole B list of Barons that didn't make the cut.
1442400	1446000	There's already been a lot of good. You're calling the Resnicks B list Barons,
1446000	1451680	the almond and pomegranate Barons of California. You're calling them B list. Hey, screw you,
1451680	1457520	man. These are these are great. These are some of the greatest robber Barons in the American economy.
1457600	1462880	Stuart Resnick and his wife, whose name I forget, they steal water from all across the state.
1462880	1469280	They're like making huge amounts of almond milk. Caliphia almond milk is them. Pome wonderful is
1469280	1474320	them. They've created company towns across of like where they, you know, force people to live
1475120	1480800	like on their property, right? They're horrible people. And I can't believe they didn't make
1480800	1484000	your list. I've insulted as someone who lives in California. You want to hear the
1484000	1487680	Resnick on your list? Have you seen my ass? Have you seen their new product?
1488480	1493920	What is their new product? Seedless lemons. Seedless lemons?
1493920	1497520	Because Americans, they're too lazy. They don't like the seed in their lemons. So like,
1498080	1501680	there's something evil. Like, this is the weirdest thing to say. Some of these Barons,
1501680	1505440	you have to kind of admire like the bullshit of it all. Like, that's kind of brilliant.
1506000	1509920	And it's, I mean, that's the funny thing about writing this book. Sorry, I shouldn't say funny,
1509920	1513920	but people tell me, oh, you got, when I was in Minnesota, like, you got, let me tell you about
1513920	1518160	this potato baron. When I was in Indianapolis, they told me about this carrot baron. You're just
1518160	1524480	like, it's so ridiculous that we have this. I mean, the Resnicks are, it sounds weird when I wrote,
1524480	1528320	when I structured this book, I wanted to mix up the narrative. So I have trashy money, then I go
1528320	1531680	aristocratic money, then trashy. You know what I mean? Like, you don't want to do the same story
1531680	1536640	over and over. The Resnicks kind of have this, they're like Cargill to me. They have this like
1536640	1540880	Greenwich, like they understand image construction in a way that my hog bearing doesn't give a
1540880	1547760	fuck about. Yeah. Yeah, they're very, they make themselves look good, right? There's a lot of,
1547760	1553200	they do a lot of donations and things like that. They make themselves look like upstanding pillars
1553200	1557840	of the community. Even in the products themselves, I mean, these people are one of the pioneers of
1557840	1565200	almond milk. And, you know, almond milk is wildly popular. And it is not great environmentally,
1565200	1569520	right? Because the almonds take so much water to make. It's like, you know, a bunch of almond,
1569520	1573200	but then it just, it's just almond plus water. And it took water to grow the almonds.
1574560	1580080	But they have like the, you know, the Caliphia almond bottle. It looks so wholesome and happy.
1580080	1584480	Oh, there's no, there's no cows involved. So it's good for me. Like it's got a, it's got a halo to
1584480	1589680	it. Oh, my favorite, I mean, their best product is obviously Fiji water. Oh, they're Fiji water as
1589680	1594480	well. I forgot about that. Let's ship water from halfway across the world and branded as bougie
1594480	1598400	and like sell people for like, you know, that's, that's where we are right now.
1599120	1603520	Hey folks, this week's sponsor is one of my favorites on this show. I endorse them whole
1603520	1608240	heartedly. And in fact, I have been using their product since long before this podcast even existed.
1608240	1611680	That's right. I'm talking about delete me. You know, you might not want to hear this,
1611680	1616800	but it has got to be said, your data is out there. There is a whole thriving ecosystem of
1616800	1622640	data brokers, people who collect, buy and sell our personal information on the internet right
1622640	1626720	now. That means your name, your phone number, your home address, the names of your relatives
1626720	1631200	and your friends is almost certainly out there waiting to be snapped up by anyone with an
1631200	1634800	internet connection. These sites are real. I have been to them myself and I've seen my own
1634800	1639520	information on them. And I've talked before about how exposed I felt when I realized that
1639520	1643680	people were literally buying my home phone number from these data brokers. And frankly,
1643680	1648080	I wouldn't wish that feeling on anyone. It was after that incident that I signed up for delete
1648080	1652960	me and I have not regretted it even for an instant ever since. But since then, the prevalence of
1652960	1657520	harassment and online bullying has only seemed to escalate. It seems like every single week I hear
1657520	1661840	a story about a real life incident that began as an argument or interaction between two strangers
1661840	1667520	on the internet or about some kind of stalking that began online. You deserve to feel secure and
1667520	1671760	anonymous on the internet and not have to be anxious about scammers, finding your phone number,
1671760	1675760	phishing attempts being sent to your email or strangers, knowing how to find your front door
1675760	1680160	step. So for that reason, I urge you to check out delete me, not just for your security, but for
1680160	1685600	your friends and family too. Their teams of experts scour the internet. They remove your and your
1685600	1690560	family's information from those data broker sites. They send you a report every single 90 days. It
1690560	1696800	really works. I can tell you it is true. Okay. And get this, you can get 20% off your delete me plan
1696800	1701920	when you go to join delete me dot com slash Adam and use promo code Adam at checkout. That's join
1701920	1708080	delete me dot com slash Adam promo code Adam. Hey, did you know that learning actually makes a sound?
1708080	1714160	It's true. Listen, that's the sound of you mastering a new language with Babel. Learning a new language
1714160	1718080	can be one of the toughest yet most rewarding challenges out there. So if you are ready to
1718080	1722400	dive in, make sure you're using the right tools to get the job done. A lot of language apps are
1722400	1726640	really just kind of games that are dressed up to make you feel like you're learning. Babel is
1726640	1732000	different though. It is the real deal. Lessons in Babel are crafted by real people for real
1732000	1736880	conversation. They're approachable with tips and tools that are all based in real life and framed
1736880	1742240	around conversation based teaching from minute one. Babel is concerned with helping you get out there
1742240	1746960	and put a new language into practice in the real world. I mean, look, I've lived in Los Angeles
1746960	1752480	for years and a ton of people here speak Spanish and starting Spanish with Babel has been rewarding
1752480	1756880	to me in ways that I didn't even anticipate. I mean, sure, it's made chatting with neighbors and
1756880	1760800	ordering food and enjoying cultural events easier to do, but more importantly, it's also just
1760800	1765840	enriched my experience of living in Los Angeles and has made me feel more connected to my community
1765840	1770720	in a way I didn't expect. It makes me excited to learn more and see what else it opens up for me.
1770720	1775200	Now, that's just my experience. But studies from Yale, Michigan State University and others
1775200	1780560	have shown that Babel is effective. One study even found that using Babel for 15 hours is equivalent
1780560	1785280	to a full semester of a college language course. And look, I can't promise that it'll be easy,
1785280	1790720	but I can promise you'll be glad you did it. And get this, here is a special limited time deal
1790720	1795200	for factually listeners. Right now you can get up to 60% off your Babel subscription,
1795200	1800960	but only for our listeners at babel.com slash factually. That's right. Get up to 60% off at

1808400	1811840	Yeah. And speaking of shipping, you know, these liquids halfway across the world,
1811840	1817760	I mean, it's ridiculous to be shipping so much food across the country or across the world in
1819200	1824720	cargo containers, right? I think about this every time I drink a Pellegrino and I like
1824720	1828240	a Pellegrino. It makes me feel classy, you know, to have a sparkling water at dinner.
1828320	1832800	But I'm like, a La Croix just comes from Wisconsin. Why do I need it shipped from Italy,
1832800	1837040	right? That's a lot more fossil fuels to have just like water brought from one place to another.
1837040	1841760	There's water here, motherfuckers. Like, why do I need it to come on a boat? And the same thing
1841760	1845440	is, it has to be true of apple juice and all these other products as well, right?
1845440	1848960	Yeah, because it's all about exploiting labor. I mean, it's this whole neoliberal trade stuff.
1848960	1852880	I mean, that is the trade component to the food system has been really underappreciated. I mean,
1853360	1858960	even if you go back to Baja and the berries, these are like, it's hard to use these words,
1858960	1863600	like almost like plantations, because people don't live a Baja. It's very sparsely populated.
1863600	1867680	It gets as much rain as Death Valley three inches a year. They bring in indigenous workers from
1867680	1873040	Oaxaca. It's so dangerous to go report this to be a journalist down there. They're plantations,
1873040	1875680	you know what I mean? They build desolidation plants on the ocean. They pull up the water,
1875680	1878960	they drain the aquifers. The people there don't eat the berries, they're for rich,
1878960	1881200	you know, they're for upper class Americans at Costco.
1881200	1884640	Wow. So they're literally, they're almost like terraforming,
1884640	1889680	like they're doing it on the surface of Mars or something. I mean, Baja California is a wonderful
1889680	1892880	place, but it's not suited to this kind of agriculture. They're just like, oh, here's
1892880	1897040	some cheap land with some cheap people. Let's just like get some water from somewhere else
1897040	1899920	or drain it out of the aquifer and we can grow our cash crop.
1899920	1904080	Yeah. It's that financialization, short term, private equity kind of thing where,
1904080	1907040	I mean, you get a massive amount of pig production in the Oklahoma Panhandle,
1907040	1910720	where like the dust bowl took place and pigs are thirsty or even you go to fucking,
1910720	1914240	sorry, you go to baker's field and it's like massive amount of dairy, dairy going on there.
1914240	1917520	And you're like, this doesn't make sense. I see an oil rig next to a dairy cow standing
1917520	1924480	in sand in the desert. Yeah. I mean, every time, you know, drive that freeway route from LA to
1924480	1928080	San Francisco, it's like the most, it's the weirdest part of the whole drive. You go through
1928080	1933120	that sea of cows and it was like something is not right here and also the air smells bad.
1933120	1937760	Yeah. I mean, like, but people don't realize that is dairy existed in Vermont, Wisconsin,
1937760	1942400	upstate New York for a reason. It made environmental logical sense. When you put it in the desert,
1943520	1948320	New Mexico does three times more dairy than Vermont now. And it's all over on the eastern
1948320	1953360	side by Texas near Clover. And it's just, these are industrial feedlots. And I mean,
1953360	1956640	dairy's really scary because these guys are kind of like feudal lords too because
1956640	1960880	they employ, it takes a lot of undocumented men to run these empires. They're usually also the
1960880	1964000	landlords. So they're both an employer and the landlords are usually the largest employer in the
1964000	1968240	county. I talked about my dairy bear and created that milk fair life. I don't know if you've ever
1968240	1974320	seen, it's like that branded milk in the grocery store. Coke just bought it for him. It's twice
1974320	1979520	the cost, half the volume of normal milk because it has high protein content. So young men love it.
1981360	1986000	It's, that's where we are. And when you say that, let's talk more about the financialization,
1986000	1991440	like that this is driven by the market, driven by private equity. How much is that the case?
1991440	1995680	Is it, yeah, describe how that process might work. I mean, part of it is, so like intellectual,
1995680	1999600	I came at this of you, to me, I really believe you have to understand how someone amassed power
1999600	2004960	to deconstruct it. And like, there's this, the simple stupid story is, oh, this was efficiency,
2004960	2009600	this was technology. But when you actually step back and you dig into it, you're like, no,
2009600	2014640	this is an old fashioned story of a combination of regulatory capture and access to cheap capital.
2014640	2018880	My hog Baron, he saw the industrial model taking hold, he was building some of those
2018880	2022800	metal sheds, he got some Wall Street money, and he was able to essentially get big when you saw
2022800	2026480	market changing. And then he established his market dominance. And then with that dominance,
2026480	2030560	he's able to essentially set the regulatory structure. Like he's given that money to the
2030560	2034640	governor of Iowa, that much money, because his whole empire is Iowa, he needs to control Iowa,
2034640	2038640	because the second you regulate hog manure, like human manure, his models no longer economically
2038640	2043440	viable, like, I can't say this, this fact blows my mind where like, I was 25 million hogs now,
2043440	2048080	and a hog defecates three times more than us. That's the manure of 75 million people. That's
2048080	2052640	California, Texas, Illinois combined. And that regulatory structure is gutted. Like there's
2052640	2058240	how many people live in Iowa? Three, three million, three million. So you got three million people
2058240	2063760	doing three million pounds of people shit. And then you've got 25 million hogs doing the equivalent
2063760	2071520	of 75 million pounds of people shit. Yes. So you're saying Iowa is something like what like
2071840	2081040	like, like, like seven eighths shit. Yes. Excuse me, excuse me, Iowans, but like the math there
2081040	2086400	is boggling my mind. It's the waterways in Iowa and open to her. Wow. No, I was gonna say like
2086400	2090480	seven percent of the waterways are too toxic to go into. You see these, there's manure lagoons
2090480	2093760	underneath them, and they occasionally leak, and you're like, no city would occasionally
2093760	2097360	leak human manure everywhere. And you know what I mean? It's such a fact of life. Yeah. And so you
2097360	2102560	say that the hog manure, despite there being many times more, we're talking 20 times more of it than
2102560	2108640	there is a human manure. Human shit is regulated. It can only be put certain places. It has to be
2108640	2113040	treated certain ways, not the case with hog shit. Yes. I mean, my favorite little example of this is
2113680	2117920	I go to, I fly a lot. It's like these coasts for like different stuff. And I, there's no
2117920	2121920	straight flight out of Iowa, shocking. And when I do that flight between Cedar Rapids and Chicago,
2122480	2126560	you're flying, especially in the winter, you fly over snow fields, fields covered in snow. And
2126640	2130240	you'll just see hog shit. Because what they do is they, every few months, you have to drain it. And
2130240	2132960	you're not really supposed to drain it and put it on snow in the winter. Because then when the snow
2132960	2136800	melts, it goes straight into the water. They do it. It's an, everyone knows they do it, and they
2136800	2140960	don't get fined for it. It's an open secret. But the worst one's actually in North Carolina,
2140960	2145600	because this is where the hog model comes out of, was a state senator deregulated this industry
2145600	2151360	in the eighties first. And he did it in the poor black areas. And because of the water table in
2151360	2155360	North Carolina and Iowa, they injected into the soil they put on top of it. In North Carolina,
2155360	2160720	they spray it into the air, the manure. So there's all these stories of spray it into the air.
2160720	2164960	Like, like they're watering the land. Wow. And so all the, and so there's stories of,
2164960	2168080	oh yeah, stories of these poor black churches having to repaint their steeples every few years
2168080	2174960	because they turn brown. Jesus Christ. Just turn brown from the hog shit. Yeah. You can't, I mean,
2174960	2180960	it's, people don't realize how the, how much destructive the quality of life is. And the way
2180960	2185040	these things, they're so, these states are so captured, you can't stop the construction of
2185040	2188720	these confinements when they go up. So your home is your everything in America. It's your wealth.
2188720	2193520	If one of those metal sheds full of piggies get built, you're fucked. Like, you can't do anything
2193520	2197280	about it. And it just destroys your wealth, destroys your quality of life. It traps you inside.
2197840	2203200	And one thing that really strikes me is how invisible this has become to mainstream America,
2203200	2207920	because you've got the destruction of the family farmer. That means that, well, you've got like
2207920	2213040	one guy owning an entire part of the food system. And then everyone working for him,
2213040	2218000	as you say, is an undocumented immigrant, someone with, you know, who's maybe here short term,
2218000	2221840	or maybe they don't speak English. They're, you know, they're not, they're not able to vote.
2221840	2227520	They're not, or they're living on some sort of weird company town, often, you know, the,
2227520	2231600	the central valley of California or Baja California, well, that's a different, different
2231600	2236480	country, but you get my point. And the people eating the food have no visibility because
2236480	2240880	there's been this, like, disconnect between the people making it and the people eating it.
2241760	2244960	Is that, does that sound right to you? Totally. I mean, like, to me, the bigger
2244960	2249760	tooth, just to add on to that is like one, you have local news collapse in these, in places
2249760	2254160	like Iowa. I mean, the one retro got gutted by private equity, Sinclair owns most of the TV stations.
2254160	2257680	So these stories aren't being told, they're not being reported out. So then the Robert
2257680	2261280	Barron essentially creates his own narrative. Like, I kind of think of Iowa, rural America,
2261280	2265600	now is like an extraction colony where the, like, the colonizers set the narrative.
2266560	2270080	Right. So these stories aren't told. And on top of that, you have a lot of news outlets in New
2270080	2273920	York City want to talk about what's the new high end restaurant. Like, there's not these structural
2273920	2277840	undercurrent stories. It's like, what's the new vegan restaurant in Brooklyn, you know?
2278640	2282480	Yeah, that's food journalism. Yeah. Yes. But it's easy. It's cheap. And on top of it,
2282480	2287040	my hog baron has his own spokeswoman. So like, there's this whole propaganda apparatus that
2287040	2291360	just licks them up and down all day. And I mean, my favorite, sorry, my favorite little,
2291360	2295200	my husband, I have these gay little sassy lines in the book I kind of love. And
2297200	2303200	in my hog baron chapter, Mike, Mike Rowe did a dirty jobs episode on my hog, my dairy baron.
2304240	2308240	I love that. By the way, you keep saying my hog baron, my dairy baron. You're really attached
2308240	2313200	to these people. You love them. I feel like you're, I just imagine you in your home,
2313200	2317120	like just with their pictures on the wall, like little shrines to them everywhere. Like,
2317120	2321200	you love these people. Oh, I'm like, I had a, actually a writer buddy of mine called me out on
2321200	2325680	that a few months ago, too, because it's had, I mean, I spent five years on this and I read
2325680	2330640	thousands of articles just to kind of get my head around it. Yeah. You get a vibe. You get a flavor
2330640	2334560	of them. You just kind of get to know what type of person they are. And like, I know that type
2334560	2339680	of guy, my dairy barons, I call them Bubba's, just that arrogant white guy that thinks they build
2339680	2343520	everything. I mean, so many of these guys cosplay as farmers, but they're really capital asset
2343520	2348480	managers. And like, he goes on dirty jobs, sells his narrative of being a farmer. And then I dig
2348480	2352560	into it and you're like, Oh, you actually claim residency at the Ritz Carlton, Puerto Rico,
2352560	2358960	probably to evade capital income taxes. And then like, and then my line on that,
2360000	2364320	my line is Mike Rowe sold his narrative. Like he used to sell products on QVC.
2365040	2372560	Because it's just like, yeah, Mike Rowe, the guy from Dirty Jobs famously, if people don't know,
2373520	2378000	you know, part of the right wing information machine, like he's, you know, been funded for
2378000	2383200	years by all the biggest right wing billionaires and, you know, pushing, has always pushed a
2383200	2386960	really pro corporate message on that show and on his other products, which is, you know,
2386960	2393920	that's his right to do as a communicator. I push a narrative that I find more true than that. But
2394000	2398160	that is, that is his ideological and historical role in the world.
2398160	2404640	Yeah. I mean, I did your thing. I didn't know that though. I just, I was in an Oklahoma watching
2404640	2409120	a Top Gun a few years ago. I was like there for something. I was at a theater and he cut an
2409120	2412880	ad before the movie, seeing how great fracking was for Oklahoma. But it was like the most
2412880	2417520	delusional ad I've ever seen. And you're like, because he's one of those people, my parents
2417520	2420400	always have them on like, it's like storage or just kind of on in the background.
2421040	2426000	Yeah. It's a good show. It's got this hidden ideological message that people don't usually
2426000	2430160	appreciate. That and like, to me, the truth was so obvious. That's what actually bothered me the
2430160	2435600	most about the Dairy Baron is they got a lot of press for how environmental sustainable they were.
2436160	2439680	And you just go to their operation. It's about an hour south of Gary, Indiana.
2439680	2444800	And it's just so obviously wrong. Like, I've never seen a Midwest cornfield with canals around it.
2444800	2448800	You're like, wait, what's going on here? And you Wikipedia, literally Wikipedia,
2448800	2452640	and this was an old wetlands. It was Everglades at the North. Teddy Roosevelt used to go hunting
2452640	2457360	here. This shouldn't be in row cropping production. And to do intensive dairy work,
2457360	2462400	dairy cows, we talk about hogs maneuvering a lot. Dairy cows do an insane amount more
2462400	2467920	where that dairy operation he's a part of has about 35,000 cows. Those cows do as much manure
2467920	2471600	in a day as the city of Austin, Texas. Wow. He's doing that in a wetland.
2471600	2476400	I mean, well, so let's talk again about the people who are doing the work for these guys.
2477280	2482800	Because, look, I mean, Trump is out there right now saying he's going to deport every
2483520	2489040	undocumented immigrant in America. But that's his policy. He wants to deport all of them.
2489040	2494480	And Biden has moved far to the right on immigration. There's almost a growing consensus
2494480	2501440	about like deportation. At the same time, our food system is built entirely on the backs of
2501440	2508400	these undocumented workers who are doing work that no middle class American would ever agree to do
2508400	2515920	at the wages that are being paid. And part of the work was basically invented for undocumented
2515920	2522240	people to be underpaid doing. And so how does that interact with our politics? I mean, just tell me
2522240	2526080	about that piece of it. It seems insane to talk about deporting these people when like,
2526080	2530800	where would you get your fucking driscals? That is the irony of it all. I mean,
2530800	2535040	my Dairy Baron gave a massive trek to Trump right after the excess Hollywood tape came out.
2535040	2537920	But it's like, dude, you're all empires and documented workers. I mean, even writing this
2537920	2544160	book, I discovered a worker died in his manure pit. Wow. It was a Honduras man, had three children,
2544160	2548960	it was never reported. It took me like two, three years to get the death records on him because
2548960	2554000	the power he wields in the county. That's the irony of it all. I mean, that's a thing I wrestled
2554000	2558240	with writing in the coffee chapter was, and I think this has been lost history is
2558480	2566400	the role monopolists play in financing fascists. And I danced around that in the book where Tim
2566400	2569920	Wu had this good book called Curse of Bigness, where he kind of mentioned it briefly. Yeah,
2569920	2573440	that book's incredible. Yeah. That's where I got a bunch of the argument that I told you about
2573440	2577280	Robert Borker from. Yeah. Yeah. And so he, but he had this little nugget in there that I dug
2577280	2582080	more into. After World War II, a big part of America's reconstruction in Japan and Europe was
2582080	2585920	trust busting. Like Congress commissioned a report and they're like, how did this happen?
2586640	2590800	One of the key findings were monopolist finance fascists. Hitler's largest owner was a company
2590800	2594640	called IG Farben. IG Farben was a chemical company. Hitler comes into a room and goes,
2594640	2598560	oh, I'll help you sell more chemicals, whatever. I don't mean all the crazy rhetoric. They cut
2598560	2603120	him a check. They sell him chemicals, including chemicals using gas chambers. That company's
2603120	2607200	broken up into seven. One of the modern day companies that was broken up into is, is, uh,
2607200	2611280	Bermont Santo. I just think that history is so important, especially now. And I think
2611280	2615760	because I'm from Iowa, I kind of saw where it all fell apart. Like Iowa should be the Italy
2615760	2619200	of North America. It should be the Napa. It should be where you go for food tourism yet
2619200	2622880	as a second highest cancer rate in America. It's one of the most obese states. The politics of
2622880	2626880	rage have filled the void of what used to be a solid middle class place of what used to be a
2626880	2631840	purple state. And we don't have to go down this path, but this is the path we're on. And like,
2631840	2636320	that is a goal I really wanted to have with this book is here's an honest conversation
2636320	2642960	where we are, but what we could do too. That's amazing how these barons have inflamed our politics
2642960	2647440	while keeping all the attention away from them, right? Like the, uh, the public, a lot of the
2647440	2653920	public is so angry about illegal immigration and undocumented immigrants. But like, why are
2653920	2658400	undocumented immigrants taking those jobs? Because these barons have created a job that
2658400	2665680	only an undocumented immigrant would take. That that is so poor and has done so by, uh,
2666320	2671120	fucking with the food system of the food that we eat. And so this is a problem that's entirely
2671120	2676640	created by them. And yet the public is angry at the victims, at the people who are dying in the
2676640	2682080	manure pits, uh, so that we can eat worse food, not all so that these guys on top can make more
2682080	2687600	money. It's insane. The bearing that it's the scariest is because how unknown they are is actually
2687680	2692160	Cargill. So Cargill is owned by the largest private company in America. They're bigger than the Koch
2692160	2696400	Brothers, but no one knows who they are. I mean, I didn't even have them in my business. Like when
2696400	2700480	I laid out the book and I grew up around Cargill. I was born next to a Cargill plant. I played soccer
2700480	2705040	next to a Cargill plant. My church was next to a Cargill plant. And they're, they're all about
2705040	2709280	owning the middle because they're not consumer-facing. You don't know who they are, but they have so
2709280	2713600	much money and power. And what they do is they engage, like I call it, um, they use middle man.
2713600	2718320	So they never do things overly. They pay these DC groups to do their bidding so they can play,
2718320	2722400	you know, be ignorant. You don't mean to play, you know, lead, um, what sort I'm looking for,
2722400	2726880	innocent, but it's currently dark. I mean, that is the fear of concentrated economic power is
2726880	2731360	you just assume it corrupts the local system. Yeah. Well, let's talk more about how this affects
2731360	2737520	the food that we actually eat in so many ways. Like the financialization, the monopolization
2737520	2742720	has actually altered the food itself, right? I mean, if I can give you a personal example of this.
2743840	2749120	I, uh, uh, last year was an upstate New York. I was on a college campus. The college campus had
2749120	2753120	some apple trees. It was like a historic apple orchard on it. And so they had some apples out,
2753120	2757200	like in the cafeteria, and they were like, Oh, you can have some, here's a Macintosh apple.
2757200	2761600	And I took the Macintosh apple and I bit it. And I was like, this tastes nothing like a Macintosh
2761600	2768960	apple I've ever had in my life. It was like crisp and juicy and had like, uh, had a complexity
2769040	2773360	of flavor. It makes me sound like a food nerd. I'm not trying to be snobby about it.
2773360	2778000	There was literally something going on with this apple I had not tasted before. Whereas every other
2778000	2782400	Macintosh, one of the most popular apple varieties in America I had had before had tasted almost
2782400	2786560	exactly the same. And you know, I'm sure this apple was fresher because it was local and da,
2786560	2791520	da, da. But also I was like something about the genetics seem different. Something like
2791520	2796560	everything about this apple was different to me. And it made me just reflect on there are all these
2796560	2801520	ways that the mechanized, financialized food system changes what we actually eat without
2801520	2807040	us realizing it until we finally have the counter example. I mean, but that's, I'm obsessed with
2807040	2811520	owning the middle with this book is how radical the system has become. And like part of owning the
2811520	2815040	middle and like, what we're talking about these reforms are like, Oh my God, animals should be
2815040	2818800	on the land. What a radical concept. Oh, food should be grown near you. Food should taste good.
2818800	2823680	People should get a decent living wage. We've gone so far off track. And I will say,
2823680	2828240	as dark as this can be, what gives me hope is everyone's seen it's not working. Like the biggest,
2828240	2832160	the thing that's kind of shocked me the most is how much the business traveler has taken to my book.
2833440	2837920	It's like a cliche for upper class Americans to go, Oh, I went to Italy, I ate better food,
2837920	2842400	I lost weight, you know, it's cheaper. Yeah, I mean, everyone's just kind of seeing it. It's
2842400	2848720	not working. And yeah, that is like, I mean, I had my one on Glenn Beck's TV network recently.
2848720	2852080	I mean, there's like this weird, there's this whole weird thing going to on the,
2852080	2857200	on the right right now over food. I mean, it's a little raw, milky RFK.
2857840	2864160	Yeah, no, but they've gotten it's sort of like the crunchy, you know, California hippies who got
2864160	2868560	kind of right wing have influenced the rest of the right wingers to get a little bit more crunchy.
2868560	2874080	And now they are really obsessed with the food system in a surprising way. I realized this
2874080	2879280	when I did a segment about for Adam ruins everything. And it was a pretty light segment.
2879280	2884080	It was just like, Hey, you can eat bugs if you want it, you know, like bugs are not that bad
2884080	2887600	for you. A lot of cultures eat bugs, there's bugs in the food you already eat. It's a good
2887600	2892960	source of protein, just like a fun light segment. And a bunch of right wingers, a bunch of right
2892960	2897360	wing blogs freaked out. And we're like, Adam Conover says you should eat bugs. And I realized that
2897360	2902960	they have some sort of like meme about how in the future we'll all be forced to eat like we're on the
2904160	2908400	snowpiercer train or something. And we're going to be forced to eat, you know, soylent green or
2908400	2913600	whatever. Like they're like, they have like a an apocalyptic future in mind. And I accidentally
2913600	2918400	like triggered them and their fear of being forced to eat bugs. And I wasn't aware of that until
2918400	2922800	that moment. I've seen ever since that was maybe five years ago, I've seen more and more of this
2922800	2928560	throughout the right wing. They're like obsession with the food system and purity and back to the
2928560	2933680	land and that kind of thing. Oh, I mean, just two things add on to that. One, I laugh because
2933680	2938400	Cargill's getting into the bug industry. They're trying to as a protein source to feed industrial
2938400	2945440	animals. So they want to as like soy, they kind of replace soybeans and corn is just feed the pigs
2945440	2950400	inside these metal sheds bugs, which is like a whole new separate thing. But that's actually why
2950400	2954560	I like book talks to your point, because you it's pattern recognition. You're like, why am I getting
2954560	2957840	a lot of questions about raw milk? Why am I getting a lot because people come up to you, they have
2957840	2962800	this conversation one on one, you're testing your rhetoric. I mean, that's actually where I get the
2963120	2967200	probably gossip for the book or like tips. It's just people like, oh, you should really look over
2967200	2971360	here. Like I did a book event in the hometown of my hog Baron. And it was the one time I was actually
2971360	2977040	scared shitless. I put the tracking on my phone. You're scared shitless because there was so much
2977040	2980480	shit surrounding you. You were ankle deep and shit. That's why you were scared shitless.
2980480	2985440	Or I could be floating in the next day, you know, like some little Chinatown thing goes down.
2986080	2993760	Please go on. But I was just that night I was the scariest I've been in the book tour because
2993760	2999520	like, I didn't expect doing this book tour was every place an old lady would always ask me,
2999520	3003760	are you worried about your safety? And honestly, I'm not in that I can say that it's honestly
3004560	3008320	the beauty of America is I can write a book like this and not be worried about my safety.
3008320	3012000	That said that town is like, I'm going into the heart of the beast. I'm going to a town of 5,000
3012000	3017360	people and I was to do a book talk. I was shocked. We had 50 people show up and to get 50 people at
3017360	3024080	a book talk in 2024 is a big deal. It was just people pissed off. And they were about more than
3024080	3030080	half the room came up to me afterwards. Oh, I knew I knew Jeff and they promised me this. They did
3030080	3034240	that. They did, you know, you could just see the anger and the sadness and people's face and like
3034240	3038800	that's also something I've internalized writing this book is there's a degree of Stockholm syndrome
3038800	3042800	in real America that I don't think urban America appreciates. A lot of people fought power and
3042800	3047920	they lost and like, you can't afford to leave. It's too depressing to really grapple with this
3047920	3052480	material. There's still some fighters. I opened with a book of a pissed off old woman fighting it.
3052480	3057760	Usually the fighters still are pissed off old ladies in rural areas, but it's hard. But it's
3057760	3061200	a weird, these people are barely getting by and you can just feel the pain. I don't know. I don't
3061200	3067120	know how to describe that, but it's just something I've noticed. Yeah. Well, I think we have all
3067120	3072240	felt that that there's something is deeply wrong with our food system. And, you know, we had a,
3072240	3076800	you know, when we cover on the show, what has happened to us health wise because of food,
3076800	3082800	the blame and to me always falls on the food system, on the capitalist food system that has,
3082800	3088160	you know, given us all of these foods that are very delicious to us, but are extremely unhealthy.
3089040	3094240	But more importantly, even the foods that are healthy have gotten less healthy, right? All the
3094240	3097440	meats have gotten, like they're produced less healthily for the people who produced them, but
3097440	3101920	also for us. Do you have any particular examples of that? And do you think that the process that
3101920	3106080	you're talking about here, this baronization, this chickenization of the food system is to
3106080	3110560	blame for our poor health outcomes? Oh, 100%. I mean, it takes money now to be healthy in America.
3111440	3115680	Yeah. One of the hardest sections where I was actually the obesity section in my green barons
3115680	3120400	chapter where it all goes back to corn and chicken, I joke. Yeah. But like,
3120400	3125600	just before corn syrup really took hold in America, we didn't have, I mean, sugar was hard to do.
3125600	3128640	Sugarcane has a very limited production region like Louisiana and Florida,
3128640	3132320	and sugar beets actually has this weird new DL supply management system where it's like,
3133120	3137200	there's quotas basically on how much you can produce. And but then the creation of corn syrup
3137840	3142000	in the 70s and 80s and the highly amount of subsidies going into it just exploded the use of
3142000	3147040	sugar. Julia Guthman is an academic at the University of Santa Cruz has done a lot of
3147120	3151680	scholarship on this and really drove that point home. But I mean, I, I see, I mean,
3151680	3154080	that's why I love going to grocery stores because you can just see the price points.
3154080	3157680	You see, you walk down the pop aisle and you're like, a two litters of buck 50,
3157680	3163040	but if I want carrot juice at $6, you're pushing people into it. And I don't want
3163040	3168560	an interview for this book that got junked. And it's because there's this elitism among
3168560	3172640	certain people where they blame the lower income person for their obesity. And I was like,
3173280	3176960	you don't get it. You don't get what it's like to work two jobs, have kids,
3177760	3183040	and this food is easy. It's easy to cook a frozen pizza. I mean, I, I grew up on that stuff. I mean,
3183040	3187920	it's, it's hard. Yeah, it takes money to eat healthy and it takes time when people are barely
3187920	3192640	getting by. Also, keep in mind, this stuff is, if you had a rough day, who isn't happy after like
3192640	3198000	a box of cheezus, you know, right? And well, there's, there's a place for that, right? And,
3198720	3203280	you know, the, there's a lot of concern that this sort of argument leads to a continual
3203280	3208800	shaming of people eating, you know, processed foods, et cetera. There's a place for processed
3208800	3214400	foods in the world, but there is also something clearly very wrong with our food system that is
3214400	3221200	like hurting people and that is doing something bad to their health. And you think it's, this is
3221200	3226960	what it, this is the culprit. Oh, 100%. I mean, the, the farm bill is a reflection of moral values
3226960	3230960	and our farm bill is now designed for Wall Street. It's designed for PepsiCo to make chips and
3230960	3234880	pop as cheap as possible at the expense of everything else. So as chips got cheaper,
3234880	3240160	you know, fresh stuff, stuff got more expensive. And yeah, it's, I mean, also these supply chain
3240160	3244400	lines, you know, it's even in like a lot of vegetables used to be grown in Iowa and that's
3244400	3248640	gone. Um, and also when things, my husband and I were just talking about carrots today,
3248640	3254320	how awful baby carrots taste. So like private equity is one of the largest grower carrots in
3254400	3259200	America. Yeah. I mean, it's really funny. I've had conversations with people before, because,
3259200	3263040	you know, I'm the kind of guy, I just look stuff up when I'm interacting with it. And I like looked
3263040	3267600	up baby carrots once and you probably know better than me. But the story that I read was that one
3267600	3272400	enterprising carrot company figured out, well, if we take the ugly carrots and we whittle them down
3272960	3277200	into little carrot nubs, then, you know, that's like reproducible. The carrot doesn't need to
3277200	3280800	be pretty, right? We can do that with any carrot. And then we can take the shavings and we can,
3280800	3285360	you know, turn it into sugar and use it as an additive in things. And when I try to tell people
3285360	3290240	this, I'm like, baby carrots are like whittled carrots. Like people will say to me in my life,
3290240	3295280	they'll go, no, they're, they're baby carrots. They're like little, they're like, the carrot is
3295280	3299920	a baby. They picked it while it was still a little child. I'm eating a carrot toddler. No,
3299920	3305120	motherfucker, it's a whittled carrot. Somebody put that on a lathe, you know, and it turned it real
3305120	3310400	fast to like shrink the carrot down. You're eating a mass produced like carrot chunk.
3310400	3312960	I'm embarrassed to say, Adam, I thought that until very recently.
3314800	3319200	They don't even look like baby carrots. They look like a piece of carpentry. They look like
3319200	3323280	something you'd use to join two, two by force. I just didn't think we'd be that wasteful. I mean,
3323280	3327280	that's why I just couldn't believe we would shave down a carrot. And then, but here's the thing,
3327280	3331840	it makes a bad product. And so like, you turn away from it. You're like, like,
3331840	3336240	melons is the other one I notice about. You got to put so much hummus on a baby carrot for it to
3336240	3339920	taste like anything. It's like the saddest experience to eat a baby carrot.
3339920	3343520	Yes. And so like it pushes, you're like, oh, produce isn't that good anymore, or
3343520	3345920	these Driscoll berries don't taste that good. So then you start eating more,
3345920	3351120	well, who isn't, you know, Oreos and stuff. And then on top of it, you go into these grocery stores
3351120	3355200	and like, you're not seeing innovation. You're not seeing new products because like these stores,
3355200	3359120	they don't want to deal with some local person doing what you only do two stores at Walmart.
3359120	3362720	They want to deal in the bisco that can do 4,000 stores. So that's why when you go into a store
3362720	3368080	now, you just see a new kind of Oreo. You don't see new products. You don't see quality stuff.
3368080	3373520	And it's, on top of it, it's, it skews the system so much where, I mean, so much of that
3373520	3377760	neoliberal framework of like, change the system with your fork to bifurcate the system even more.
3377760	3381360	You have like, whatever that fancy LA one's called Aragon for like the rich.
3381360	3387520	Arawan, yeah. Arawan. And then you have like, Walmart is massive. Walmart sells one in three
3387520	3391920	groceries. Their market share grocery is the same as the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh,
3391920	3395280	and eighth combined. That is an insane amount of market power.
3395280	3400640	And as you say, one baron creates more barons because Walmart wants all the food. They want to
3400640	3405920	buy it in huge tranches. They want to get all their food from one supplier. And so that privileges
3405920	3411120	the one supplier who's able to grow the exact same thing in huge quantities to sell to every
3411120	3416320	Walmart store simultaneously. And that causes them to buy each other up. Or for one, like if
3416400	3419440	Walmart's selling one out of three groceries, then pretty soon you're going to have one person
3419440	3423600	selling one out of three berries and then probably even more than that. You said melons,
3423600	3426240	though. What's the problem with melons? I wanted to hear it.
3426240	3430080	I mean, after spending all this time, I mean, feel sorry for my husband because I just vomit
3430080	3433760	this information I had on all day. And so we got married two years ago.
3433760	3437680	I'll replace them. I'll marry you. I love hearing this stuff. He doesn't want to hear it anymore.
3437680	3440240	Okay. Propose. I'm down.
3440240	3444160	Our one year anniversary, we went to like, like France and Italy. And I'm just,
3444160	3449200	I got to see a food system that worked. And I hate cantaloupe. I just, I see it in the fruit
3449200	3452720	bowl. I think it tastes awful. But then like, they had it over there and you're like, wait,
3452720	3455760	this is actually really good. They would sell it on the side of the road. You pull over,
3455760	3460720	you buy a good cantaloupe and you're like, it's just, it's kind of like when you cut corners
3460720	3464640	so much, at some point you're cutting bone. Like there's no efficiencies again. You're
3464640	3469040	cutting quality and it's just so rapid, especially private equity people don't,
3469680	3473200	they don't understand how to run a business. I mean, the reason the best grocery stores in
3473200	3477760	America are actually still privately owned, like HGB in Texas, Hive in Iowa, Wegmans on the East
3477760	3481920	Coast. You know what I mean? There's not this Wall Street financialization because like,
3481920	3486160	some boy who went to Harvard MBA, who's never worked a grocery store job in his life,
3486160	3491440	doesn't understand the nuances of this, of these marketplaces. And it's also, it's a profession.
3491440	3495760	There's a craftsmanship to merchandising. My dad used to be a beer merchandiser. So like,
3495760	3499600	I noticed that when I go into like, you go into like a Wegmans or whatever, fancy growth, like,
3499600	3502640	sorry, those type of grocery stores, they merchandise, they care, they're,
3502640	3506000	it's homecoming weekend. It's gonna be a bunch of homecoming stuff. You go into Walmart and
3506000	3510400	they just throw the pallet on the shelf and you have to dig for it. Yep. Well, what can,
3510400	3515120	what can be done about this, right? You had said that maybe there's a positive sign in Lena Kahn's
3515120	3519360	leadership at the FTC. We'll see how long she's there based on what's happening, what's going
3519360	3524640	to happen in November. I kind of don't think Trump will keep her on if he wins. But you know,
3524640	3531040	we have seen a sea change in antitrust enforcement, at least on the Democratic side.
3531040	3536480	And there are occasionally some Republicans who will join in on an antitrust fight here or there.
3536480	3540720	They do occasionally have an ally. And you're saying that, you know, the right, right side
3540720	3547040	of the aisle is becoming more and more obsessed with food. So is there a growing appetite for
3547040	3552240	change in our food system? Yeah, I mean, I think what Lena is really fascinating is,
3552240	3555760	I actually think she's one of President Biden's best of local points, because
3556480	3561200	what says so much was earlier this year, Matt Gaetz went to the Wall Street Journal and praised her.
3561200	3566560	Wow. That is, they're such a, I'm a big fan of outflanking, like Republicans will talk this
3566560	3571120	big game about me backing, be right there with them. Josh Hawley does a lot of this,
3571760	3576720	outflank Republicans here, because it's such a, hold their feet to the fire. I mean,
3576720	3580720	it's also kind of, I'm a big believer too that weird things happen in America when
3580720	3584640	unique coalitions come together. But what gives me the big most hope and what we can do are like
3584640	3589360	three things that come to my mind. One is the death of ethanol. The Biden administration has
3589360	3593360	been incredibly aggressive at transitioning America out of flake to EVs and hybrids. And
3593360	3597360	people don't realize, but the largest use of corn now in America is ethanol. And it's really,
3597360	3603600	which is used for what? Burning, burning corn in your cars. Like it's truly. Wow. It is the Museum
3603600	3608480	of Failure included ethanol and it's an exhibit. I, anyone that thinks ethanol is good for the
3608480	3613680	climate thinks the world is flat in 2024. Also, I think in food, you see one of President Biden's
3613680	3618000	worst political appointments, Secretary Vilsack. Secretary Vilsack of USDA is a former industrial
3618000	3622400	dairy lobbyist. His solution to climate change right now is to put ethanol in the airplanes.
3622400	3628480	Wow. And by the way, this is a crazy thing to do because like fossil fuels are bad enough
3628480	3632560	because you're taking energy out of the ground, putting it into the atmosphere, right? Stored
3632560	3637920	energy out of the ground into the atmosphere. That's bad. That warms the earth de facto, right?
3637920	3643200	But if you're taking energy from the sun and putting it into the atmosphere, right? Like the
3643200	3647600	sun is hitting the corn, making the corn grow. And then you're burning that. You're releasing,
3647600	3651040	that's a whole new source of energy to put into the atmosphere to heat the planet up.
3651040	3653680	It's even worse because you have to use fossil fuels to help grow the corn.
3653680	3656000	Right. Of course you do. Fertilizer and et cetera. Yeah.
3656000	3659760	And the other appreciated thing is Koch brothers are actually massive in fertilizer. They have
3659760	3664320	a massive holding in nitrogen fertilizer. So like there's this whole weird marriage between
3664400	3668560	big egg and big fossil fuel oil that hasn't been fully, I don't think people realize.
3668560	3672320	But it's just delusional. But you know what? It's like watching Miley Coady chase that
3672320	3676640	bird off the cliff right now. Ethanol is going to die. I don't care what the industry says.
3676640	3681840	It's going to meet its maker. And my big moment, to me, it's what are we going to do at that moment?
3683040	3686800	I want to put animals back on land. That is like truly one of my biggest things because it's like,
3687360	3691360	it takes the temperature down. It makes, who doesn't want more farmers? Here's like,
3691360	3695040	most grain production is going to be robotics. That's not a bad thing. You go to a farm show
3695040	3700080	now. These tractors drive themselves. But there's only so many dairy cow one man or one person could
3700080	3706720	look after. But for these rural areas, it's more jobs. Yeah. So you want to go to a small scale
3706720	3714960	version of dairy farming again, like breaking it up. And rather than one farmer, one quote farmer
3714960	3718960	owning huge numbers of cows, you've got small scale farms again. You think that's a massive
3719040	3724080	improvement? I just want to go back to that family farmer model. It's also what it does too.
3725760	3729200	Theory is weird where actually this industrial dairy model is actually even worse for the climate
3729200	3734800	because when a cow is on pasture, when she defecates, she's fertilizing her feet.
3734800	3737840	When you put them indoors, first of all, you have to use fossil fuels to grow her feet.
3737840	3742800	But when you pull her manure, when it breaks down, it creates additional methane that is not
3742800	3748320	produced when she defecates on land. So it creates additional fossil fuel gas. So like that bakers
3748320	3752960	field dairy production model is actually incredibly more destructive for the environment than
3752960	3757840	some dairy cow in Wisconsin. So like Bill Sack comes out of that world. So that's why
3757840	3763600	he has this like bullshit kind of mentality there. But do you think there is an emerging politics
3763600	3770480	that is more populist food politics where we can sort of go across partisan lines?
3771200	3779360	Because if you're looking for rural America is largely red and Republican politicians tend to
3779920	3784880	have pro-corporate policies. So do Democrats, but these are trends we're talking about.
3784880	3788720	It does seem like this is an issue that could break some of our political logjam if you have
3789760	3795440	politicians from rural areas say, no, actually, I want to fight for the chicken farmer,
3795440	3801280	the hog farmer, the small scale pork farmer like these and actually help their folks.
3801280	3805120	Oh, totally. I mean, keep in mind, I also want to broaden the conversation because it's not just
3805120	3808640	about the farmer. It's about those who pick it, process it, transport it, cook it, serve it.
3808640	3814160	Of course. People like my mom and dad, that's one in 10 of Americans. And we're obsessed with such
3814160	3818560	a small part of the pie. And once you talk about one in 10, you center that on labor,
3819120	3824240	that's what really matters. And the dirty secret of big ag is it hollowed out its voter base.
3824240	3828080	You used to have thousands of Iowa hog farms and now you just have a few of our
3828080	3831840	barons and no one's called bluff on it. Denver has no clothes now and no one's called it.
3831840	3835600	And that's also my big thing now is I think we should junk the farm bill.
3835600	3840320	The farm bill picks favorites. It heavily subsidizes grains. It's destructive for the climate.
3840880	3847920	It rewards its incentive, this destructive model. On top of it, you have the whole heritage
3848480	3853600	heritage, Kato Institute. They hate that model too. They hate the farm bill.
3853600	3858000	And I think that's a, to me, there's no reason why Democrats should support the modern-day farm
3858000	3862320	bill. The best example of how rotten the farm bill has gotten is actually crop insurance.
3862320	3865920	Because when people hear crop insurance, they think it's for a hurricane or rain or whatever.
3865920	3871920	It's not. It's insurance for low prices where 60% of the premium is paid for by the taxpayer.
3873600	3877200	And there's no cap at them. So people don't realize Bill Gates has won the largest owner
3877200	3881440	of farmland in America. If you want to talk about another baron. So he can get as much crop
3881440	3887440	insurance as he wants, as much corn as he wants. And so, you know what I mean? It's so,
3887920	3892880	I just, I've been telling reformers, don't play, like, the system is so broken. Why
3892880	3899040	back that? Like let's move away from the system. At the same time, use school meals as like the
3899040	3904560	positive structural change vehicle. Who doesn't want all dairy-served Wisconsin come from, you
3904560	3908400	know, pasture family dairy farms instead of like industrial beef in the Brazilian rainforest.
3908400	3912320	Like it's good politics. It's good tasting. You keep your money local and you're building up a new
3912320	3916560	system as you phase out an old one. Because I mean, school food's a joke. We all know that.
3916560	3922320	Yeah. But the problem is the farm bill is one of those bills that, you know, no matter how divided
3922320	3928800	Congress is, it flies through every time because it has so many parts of the society are dependent
3928800	3932800	on it, right? Like it's got something for everybody or it's got something for the voters
3932800	3936960	in or the constituents or the money constituents in every area, you know. It gives
3937920	3943920	subsidies to the cities to purchase food, gives subsidies to the, you know, to the barons in the
3943920	3950000	red areas to grow the food. Is there really a chance that it could be, you know, junked, as you say?
3950000	3954320	I mean, it's actually kind of falling apart. I mean, they couldn't pass. They tried to do
3954320	3958320	basically a copy-paste bill and they had to punt it. So like the rumor on the street is going to try.
3958320	3959520	Okay. No, no.
3959520	3962080	Then I'm not up on what's happened. That's amazing.
3962080	3966080	No, but it's part, but it's this weird thing where, so even Republicans find crop insurance
3966080	3969680	too gluttonous. Like they want more crop insurance. You're right though. I mean,
3969680	3975360	there's this weird coalition of like, it's food stamps in the farm entitlement programs.
3975360	3979520	I'll be frank. I think you can break those apart. Food stamps are going to be okay because
3979520	3984800	Walmart depends on food stamps. Walmart is the richest family in America. Some days it's the
3984800	3989440	richest family in the world. So much of their employee and customer base depends on food stamps.
3990080	3994240	It's a waste subsidy. So much of corporate America needs that. I'm feeling comfortable.
3994240	3998400	No one's going to touch that. I mean, first of all, you just need all Democrats and 10 Republicans
3998400	4004640	to save that. You take away the crop insurance. You do Farm Bill standalone. Half Republicans
4004640	4009200	will flake on that. And if Democrats don't support it, these, these, my hog baron, you know what I
4009200	4012800	mean? Like they don't have a constituency. Yeah. They're massive amount of welfare they get. It's
4012800	4017760	just also that coalition was formed in 1960s America. The suburbs were not a part of that
4017760	4021680	coalition. Right. Like rural America's, there's something. The suburbs. I left the suburbs out
4021680	4026800	of the story. And I mean, this election will come down to a few suburbs in the Midwest states.
4027680	4033360	Yeah. What can the public do about this if there isn't sense about this as I am to take us out?
4033360	4038080	The big thing is I always tell people, buy what you can, buy your values, whatever. But the other
4038080	4042240	thing too is help connect your farmers doing it right with your schools, with your colleges.
4042240	4046320	Those procurement contracts really stabilize them. Like a lot of farmers will tell you privately,
4046320	4050000	they don't like doing the farmers market. They get rained out, whatever. It's not consistent.
4050000	4053760	You get that contract with the UC school system, your local school. It's just such a good
4054400	4058080	stabilizer. And you want to build up the people doing it right. Because writing this book over
4058080	4061920	five years is, yes, I focus on a few bad people, but most people are good. They're trying to do
4061920	4066480	the right thing. They're just struggling. And so how do you rep? How do you copy and paste them
4066480	4071280	and help them, you know, not decay, but like actually grow and, and because it's also,
4071280	4074160	there's no positive vision here. That's why I realized writing this book. No, no,
4074160	4077040	neither party is articulating that positive vision, especially for rural America.
4077040	4080320	And I actually think people crave a positiveness. Like they want the opposite of what they have
4080320	4084560	right now. And the positiveness is inspiring. You're like, okay, it gives people that power
4084560	4089200	to rush the gates to get to that better system. Like that's what gives me hope, I should say.
4089200	4093840	Yeah. And it sort of seems like all we need is a politician to, or a leader to really run on that
4093840	4100080	stuff, you know, and to say, you know, to find the way that this affects everybody and to speak
4100080	4103920	to people who haven't been spoken to. It literally is a pinata saying, hit me, hit me. I mean, look,
4103920	4106720	the meat packing, especially breaking up the meat companies, like these aren't,
4106720	4109360	these are comically corrupt companies. By the way, they're not even American.
4109360	4112000	They're like these weird state-backed monopolies. Yeah.
4112000	4115200	Smithfield's quasi, there's this weird Chinese relationship there.
4115920	4121600	A lot of the beef companies are Brazilian. So it's like, there's good politics there. It's just
4121600	4125120	something that you're waiting for the right person, vocal courage to take a swing of that
4125120	4129520	pinata. On God willing, somebody will. And I can't thank you enough for coming on here to make
4129520	4133600	the case that somebody should. You've certainly convinced me. The name of the book is Barons.
