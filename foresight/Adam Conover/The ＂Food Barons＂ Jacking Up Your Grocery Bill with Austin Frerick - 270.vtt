00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me again. You know,

00:04.480 --> 00:09.520
if you're like me, you like to eat. In fact, you have to eat or you'll die. And you might have

00:09.520 --> 00:14.960
noticed that food has been getting a lot more expensive. Although inflation for food has slowed

00:14.960 --> 00:20.240
relative to 2022, you have to remember that the effects of inflation are cumulative. And recent

00:20.240 --> 00:25.440
numbers showed increased prices for everything from frozen juice to ground beef. Eating out is

00:25.520 --> 00:31.280
more expensive than last year. And even vending machine prices are up. It sucks. Again, we all

00:31.280 --> 00:35.760
have to eat. And for most of us, living off the grid and growing our own meat and potatoes is not

00:35.760 --> 00:41.440
an option. So ideally, we'd have a world where different food companies compete to get us the

00:41.440 --> 00:48.080
lowest price, right? Well, unfortunately, just as with industries like newspapers, internet advertising,

00:48.080 --> 00:54.080
airlines and athletic shoes, that competition doesn't exist anymore at all. Instead, our food

00:54.080 --> 00:59.600
system is run by monopolies. And those monopolies have the power to screw us, whether we're their

00:59.600 --> 01:04.800
customers, their workers or citizens living in places where they exert unfair and undemocratic

01:04.800 --> 01:10.160
influence over our lives. I mean, I can't believe I have to say this, but food is simply one of the

01:10.160 --> 01:16.320
necessities of life, which means it's a bad thing that only a few people in this country have control

01:16.320 --> 01:22.480
over that necessity. You simply cannot explain how we get our beef, pork, grain, how grocery stores

01:22.480 --> 01:27.840
work, why prices are higher than ever without understanding the influence of these massive

01:27.840 --> 01:33.200
and manipulative companies. And luckily on the show today, we have a guest who knows everything

01:33.200 --> 01:38.800
about it. And not only that is from one of the very regions that produces our essential food

01:38.800 --> 01:44.000
stuffs. He not only knows about this, he has lived it himself. And I cannot wait for you to hear this

01:44.000 --> 01:47.600
interview. But before we get to it, I just want to remind you that if you want to support this show

02:18.960 --> 02:24.720
policy. He's a fellow at Yale and he is born and currently lives in Iowa right here in the United

02:24.720 --> 02:30.160
States. His fantastic new book is called Barons, Money, Power, and the Corruption of America's

02:30.160 --> 02:36.880
Food Industry. Please welcome Austin Frarick. Austin, thank you so much for being on the show,

02:36.880 --> 02:41.920
man. Thanks for having me on, Adam. Okay, so tell me, what is so fucked up about America's Food System?

02:42.480 --> 02:47.120
How radical it's become. You have one man in Iowa as the most powerful political person in the state

02:47.120 --> 02:53.440
and he does five million hogs a year. I mean, not alone. He does five million hogs a year.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.760
What do you mean by he does them? That could mean a lot of things, some of which I don't want a picture.

02:57.760 --> 03:02.800
Yes, so he owns, so he has about 7,000 workers and employees at this point. A lot of them are

03:02.800 --> 03:06.800
contractors. You got to be careful with the word workers, but he owns five million hogs. He has

03:06.800 --> 03:11.280
other people grow them, but he maintains the ownership as they grow them out. But his operation

03:11.280 --> 03:16.560
produces five million hogs a year. And how much of the American pork supply is that?

03:16.560 --> 03:20.000
So he's the fourth largest pork producer in America. Basically in my lifetime,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.760
you've seen the hog family farmer die, where you have the 10 largest entities

03:23.760 --> 03:27.600
do about 70% of the hog market, control it, including the largest owner of hogs is actually

03:27.600 --> 03:31.680
Chinese multinational, Smithfield. Is there a reason you're saying, by the way, hogs and not pigs?

03:31.680 --> 03:33.760
I'm just very curious. Oh, no, I use them interchangeably.

03:34.400 --> 03:40.880
Okay, I was like, is pigs wrong? Should I not be saying pigs? Do I look like city folk if I'm

03:40.880 --> 03:47.120
saying pigs? Okay. Well, and so why is that a problem to have that be so monopolized in

03:47.120 --> 03:51.360
so few hands that one person is doing, you know, is doing so many hogs?

03:51.360 --> 03:55.120
So let's just take hogs and I, so I open my book opens with a hog Baron, this hog guy.

03:56.880 --> 04:01.440
I know, isn't that first of all, it's not so. I'm sorry. The hog Baron is just, what a great

04:01.440 --> 04:04.960
image. It sounds like an anime character or something like that. I imagine a guy with like a

04:04.960 --> 04:09.520
top hat and there's like a little snout on the front. He's got some goggles and he's like,

04:09.520 --> 04:13.760
hello, I'm the hog Baron oink oink. Like that's, what a great guy.

04:13.760 --> 04:17.680
You got to put a little bit more Florida on him. So my hog Baron has like a Florida twist to him.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.720
First of all, I find this campy. That's kind of why I like this framework is it,

04:22.720 --> 04:28.080
you don't feel powerlessness because it's so morally ridiculous. And this whole thing started

04:28.080 --> 04:32.800
because of him. It literally was in a bar in Des Moines, 2018, where someone, a political person

04:32.800 --> 04:36.320
was complaining. I didn't know at the time, but like Iowa doesn't have campaign contribution

04:36.320 --> 04:41.280
limits. So he had given the governor $300,000 for her campaign. Wow. And the thing that caught

04:41.280 --> 04:45.840
my eye was, it was not even that, it was, he has a home in the rich suburb of Des Moines,

04:45.840 --> 04:49.440
he has a home down in Naples, Florida, which says something, but he has a private jet that he flies

04:49.440 --> 04:53.520
back and forth between the two. Wow. And I was like, that's power. That is like that imagery

04:53.520 --> 04:58.240
says everything. But how did Iowa fall apart in my lifetime? And how do I tell this bigger

04:58.240 --> 05:03.200
structural story with this little like trashy Florida man? So there used to be such a thing

05:03.200 --> 05:10.320
as a family hog farmer. Now we have a hog baron, but there used to be a hog peasant or a hog,

05:11.200 --> 05:17.440
small landowner, right? A hog family farmer. Yeah. And now those people now are low wage

05:17.440 --> 05:20.800
workers for this baron. And instead of like, you know, having a relationship with the animal,

05:20.800 --> 05:24.640
your job now is about 10% of the pigs die inside these muddle sheds. So you're paid to go in their

05:24.640 --> 05:28.960
hall at the dead bodies to throw them into a dumpster. Wow. I mean, that is, that is where we

05:28.960 --> 05:33.680
are now. But that's also like for those people in erosion in the middle class, right? Because if

05:33.680 --> 05:40.640
you previously, I assume, were a hog farmer, you had some ownership of some land, of the animals,

05:40.640 --> 05:45.360
of your production pipeline. You were a producer selling to somebody. And I imagine that that

05:45.360 --> 05:49.440
you're able to make more money that way than when you're just a surf working for the hog baron.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.160
Yeah. And you're spending your money locally, you're paying taxes, you're sending your kids to

05:52.160 --> 05:56.880
school, and that's all gone. You see the massive consolidation of power. And honestly, the guy's

05:56.880 --> 06:00.640
probably taking his money down the floor to knowing how this game works. And what happens is

06:00.640 --> 06:06.080
it's basically modern day sharecropping. It really comes from chicken. They call it chickenization

06:06.080 --> 06:10.800
and it's happened across the food system and it happened to pork. He saw that coming where I kid

06:10.800 --> 06:14.480
you not a century ago when they wrote the regulations to tackle the main monopolies in

06:14.480 --> 06:18.160
response to Upton's and Clare's the jungle. When they wrote the regulations, they didn't write

06:18.160 --> 06:21.440
chicken into it because there weren't commercial chicken slaughterhouses. You just butchered a

06:21.440 --> 06:26.640
chicken in your backyard. So down south, corporations took that model to black farmers

06:26.800 --> 06:31.040
that a sharecropping model plighted the chicken. And then what you see is USDA didn't step in

06:31.040 --> 06:34.720
saying chicken, you can't behave that way. And you see the chickenization of everything else.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.600
Wait, so let's get a little bit of a bird's eye view of the history of American food production

06:39.600 --> 06:44.960
because you started talking about, you dropped so many little historical bombs there, sharecropping,

06:45.920 --> 06:52.160
the regulations in the Upton Sinclair era. So take us to the moment before Upton Sinclair,

06:52.160 --> 06:57.120
what did things look like? Why did the regulations come in and then what did we live in?

06:57.120 --> 07:01.200
What world of food did we live in after those regulations up until the present day?

07:01.200 --> 07:04.800
Yeah, so I think actually meatpacking is a single best way to like talk about all this stuff because

07:04.800 --> 07:09.760
it shows what the system could be and how it all falls apart. But let me also first start with

07:09.760 --> 07:13.760
the notion that I want to be very careful about romanticizing the past in the food system because

07:13.760 --> 07:19.040
in the day it's rooted in genocide and slavery. Yeah. But we did make progress. We really did

07:19.040 --> 07:23.760
and you saw the meatpacking where we as a society were mad and angry at what we saw in the jungle,

07:23.760 --> 07:28.320
the meat quality we were getting, and we made policy choices to break up these meat companies,

07:28.320 --> 07:34.640
to empower the workers, and they got power. That became a solid middle-class job. People on both

07:34.640 --> 07:38.400
sides of my family did that for a living. And then what we've seen since the election of President

07:38.400 --> 07:43.120
Reagan is systematic assault on that industry, massive consolidation, where even in my book,

07:43.120 --> 07:48.480
I have a slaughtering baron, this super corrupt Brazilian family where I would actually argue

07:48.480 --> 07:52.000
they're the closest thing to a criminal organization in modern-day corporate America.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.360
Wow. Which is saying a lot, but they actually pled guilty to bribing their way to monopoly

07:55.360 --> 07:59.920
level status. And I'm not talking campaign bribes. I'm talking bribery. But they're now the largest

07:59.920 --> 08:03.200
meatpacker in America. They're the largest meatpacker in the world's ever seen. And that's why we

08:03.200 --> 08:08.160
see rampant use of child labor. We see all these bad things we tackled. This regulatory system

08:08.160 --> 08:11.760
collapsed and we shouldn't be shocked that robber barons are filling that void.

08:11.760 --> 08:17.760
So you said members of your family did this kind of work in maybe not the good old days,

08:17.760 --> 08:23.280
but decades ago and made a living that way. So what did their lives look like compared to what

08:23.280 --> 08:27.520
it looks like now? Yeah, I mean, my grandfather. My grandfather was kind of like my idol. He worked

08:27.520 --> 08:33.760
at a hog plant town, the old Wilson's. They bought a home out in the country. He had a little acreage

08:33.760 --> 08:37.680
I grew up. That's kind of actually why I lived farming and gardening is I grew up working his

08:37.680 --> 08:46.160
plot with him. He owns his house. And nowadays, I mean, just even where I live, a lot of immigrants

08:46.160 --> 08:50.000
and they live in section 8 housing. They're usually Sudanese and they work at either in

08:50.000 --> 08:54.800
Tame or Waterloo, Iowa. They live two or three families to a two bedroom. You know what I mean?

08:54.800 --> 08:58.000
My grandfather could buy a house, lived American dream and now these people are barely getting

08:58.000 --> 09:02.240
by and where they live is actually most highly impoverished school district, sorry, school,

09:02.240 --> 09:06.800
elementary in the city. It's just, it says so much of where we've become and it's incredibly

09:06.800 --> 09:11.840
dangerous. And you add the whole layer on top of it of a lot of these workers either undocumented

09:11.840 --> 09:15.920
or on the marginal thing of there's just so much abuse going on that we just don't even know about.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.040
So how did this transition take place? How do we go from the world that your grandfather lived

09:21.040 --> 09:25.120
into the world that these folks now inhabit? I mean, I just think we're living in a second

09:25.120 --> 09:29.840
gilded age, just another Lazi Farah thing. And it's such a simple thing, but I realized sitting

09:29.840 --> 09:34.160
in a biz school class a few years ago, the goal of any corporate executive is monopoly.

09:35.200 --> 09:40.720
Period. And so like, you saw what they did regulatory capture, you know, the election

09:40.720 --> 09:45.040
of Reagan was such a game changer of just, I know you had Lena Conn on. I mean,

09:45.040 --> 09:50.960
that's like to me, this best way of hope right now is we're, we're moving away from that model,

09:50.960 --> 09:56.320
but it allowed massive consolidation to occur where my coffee Baron in my book is a secret

09:56.320 --> 10:01.280
German family that now sells more coffee than Starbucks, but didn't even sell it being a coffee

10:01.280 --> 10:06.960
in America till 2012. They bought Panera, Caribou coffee, Ironsigns Bagels, Burgers Bagels, Curie

10:06.960 --> 10:12.480
Cups, Stumptown, Telegencia, Krispy Kreme, you name it. They bought all of the worst bagel chains

10:12.480 --> 10:16.160
as a lifelong New Yorker. They bought all the bagel chains I would never fucking eat at.

10:16.720 --> 10:22.080
In my life, they have spongy bagels. They, they toast every single one of them. And, and along

10:22.080 --> 10:26.800
with all these other chains as well. So, sorry, go on, please. No, I was just laughing because

10:26.800 --> 10:30.080
that's like a hot point in my marriage. My husband agrees with you. I love Panera Crunch,

10:30.080 --> 10:35.440
Panera Bread, Semina Crunch Bagel. My husband's from New York City.

10:35.440 --> 10:39.760
It's fine if you, you know, if you got to eat in a mall, it's completely fine. I get it. But yeah,

10:39.760 --> 10:42.720
please, please go on. Like, how did, yeah, how did this occur?

10:43.840 --> 10:47.520
Robert Bork. I mean, there's always going to be hatchet men for industry. I mean,

10:47.520 --> 10:50.720
there's always going to be academics doing the bidding of the rich. And he basically

10:50.720 --> 10:54.720
flipped America's antitrust laws upside down. We had all these guardrails. Like,

10:54.720 --> 10:58.480
what the coffee bearing did could not have been done just a few decades ago. You couldn't come

10:58.480 --> 11:02.880
in and roll up a competitive industry. But when these guardrails came away where they came

11:02.880 --> 11:07.600
both with this kind of junk science where consumer welfare standards, what they call it,

11:07.600 --> 11:10.720
where you can show that prices go lower. For consumers, you can buy a company.

11:10.720 --> 11:15.040
You can hire any economist to produce those numbers. And so you see massive consolidation

11:15.040 --> 11:19.040
in meat packing, in coffee, in grain, in all these different industries. I actually think

11:19.040 --> 11:24.000
food is the most concentrated industry in America because it's that illusion of choice.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.120
You know what I mean? Like, if you look at the peanut butter area, there's actually one company

11:27.120 --> 11:30.960
has about a 60% market share in peanut butter, but they have all these different brands.

11:30.960 --> 11:36.400
Wow. 60% market share in peanut butter. Like, so Laura Scutter is not a real person. That's

11:36.400 --> 11:40.400
what you're telling me. She's just part of some bigger conglomerate. She's actually owned by that

11:40.400 --> 11:46.560
company. I think it's Smuckers. Smuckers invented Laura Scutter. I thought her name

11:46.560 --> 11:51.280
too conveniently rhymed with peanut butter. I was looking at Laura Scutter, peanut butter.

11:51.280 --> 11:55.360
There's no way that this lady was like, you know what? My name sounds like peanut butter.

11:55.360 --> 11:59.040
Let me start an independent peanut butter company. There's a fake lady. This is why my mom hates

11:59.040 --> 12:01.760
grocery shopping with me because I love telling her these little factoids when we shop.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.240
Yeah, in the same way. I think we would have a good time at the grocery store together

12:06.240 --> 12:09.120
because we'd spend about three hours there and never buy anything. We'd just be pointing at stuff

12:09.120 --> 12:14.320
going, oh, you know what's fucked up about this? About this maple syrup or whatever.

12:14.320 --> 12:18.080
I mean, even my favorite is probably my favorite chapter right was the grocery chapter because

12:18.080 --> 12:22.400
I love them. But I had a grocery guy tell me, you got to think of a grocery store as modern-day

12:22.400 --> 12:26.720
mafioso capitalism because even the shelf space, there is so much shenanigans going on what you

12:26.720 --> 12:31.120
see at the eye level, like the whole slotting fees, all these games going on. It's incredible.

12:31.120 --> 12:39.920
Yeah. So what happens? I know about the consumer welfare standard. Robert Bork puts out a very

12:39.920 --> 12:47.280
influential paper called I believe the Antitrust Paradox, making the argument that all the antitrust

12:47.280 --> 12:50.640
enforcement that we had for decades and decades in America that broke up monopolies and made

12:50.640 --> 12:56.480
sure monopolies couldn't form actually was bad and that we shouldn't be applying it. And instead,

12:56.480 --> 13:01.760
we should only break up a monopoly when the price is going to go up for consumers. If the price goes

13:01.760 --> 13:06.800
down, it's okay. Yes. And then that has the advantage of being very easy for judges to

13:06.800 --> 13:10.720
adjudicate, right? You just get an economist before a judge and the economist says, oh,

13:10.720 --> 13:13.920
here's some numbers that say the prices go down. Well, the judge isn't an economist.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.880
They're listening to, they're like, oh, you're an economist. All right. So if you say the prices

13:16.880 --> 13:20.800
go down, I guess they'll go down. That's good enough for me. I'm just some fucking judge and

13:20.800 --> 13:25.840
bangs the gavel and they allow the mergers to go through. And that's happened in so many different

13:27.040 --> 13:31.680
industries. It's happened in my industry, the entertainment industry, so many others. But 60%

13:31.680 --> 13:36.880
of peanut butter or all these coffee chains, that's a huge amount of consolidation. That would be

13:36.880 --> 13:40.480
illegal if not for the sea change and antitrust enforcement. It's actually probably higher than

13:40.480 --> 13:43.760
60% because a lot of times they do the store label and you only know as usually when there's a

13:43.760 --> 13:49.680
peanut recall. Okay. You're totally, I mean, when you're explaining that whole

13:50.720 --> 13:55.360
Robert Bork framework is to me, that's the hallmark of this era is big words to hide. I mean,

13:55.360 --> 14:01.040
you're using complex language to keep people out to really hide shenanigans like consumer

14:01.040 --> 14:04.400
welfare at standard. Those words mean nothing, but they sound really smart and it plays into

14:04.400 --> 14:07.840
people's intellectual insecurity because they don't want you to know what they're doing. That's

14:07.840 --> 14:12.160
all that is. Yeah. The consumer welfare standard is like, oh, that sounds like a big important

14:12.160 --> 14:16.960
legal doctrine that very important smart people came up with. And you shouldn't argue with it.

14:16.960 --> 14:21.440
And it gives the decision, the era of legitimacy. When in fact, to what it's much simply, they're

14:21.440 --> 14:25.760
just saying, hey, let's let the mergers go through. It's junk science, masking moral judgments.

14:25.760 --> 14:29.200
In the day, how many logs one man should own? That's a moral question we should wrestle with

14:29.200 --> 14:32.640
as a democracy. Excel can't tell you that answer, but we pretend to do it.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.720
Well, so give me more examples about why this is such a big problem in food. Again,

14:36.720 --> 14:41.600
I know this is a larger economic problem, but what makes it so bad in the food system?

14:41.600 --> 14:43.680
The workers, the workers are the ones being squeezed here the most.

14:45.200 --> 14:49.200
That, I mean, that is the one that shocks people the most. My book is My Berry Baron,

14:50.080 --> 14:57.040
Driscoll's. Your Berry Baron. Oh, Driscoll's. Driscoll's is in. Driscoll's is in my supermarket.

14:57.040 --> 15:00.560
I buy Driscoll's all the time. They sell one in three berries in America.

15:02.240 --> 15:07.120
But they don't grow a single berry, Adam. They sell one in three berries, but they grow zero

15:07.120 --> 15:11.920
berries. Is that what you said? Yes. Yes. How is that possible? Chicken. They chickenized the

15:11.920 --> 15:18.720
berry industry. And it's like a combination of Silicon Valley meets chicken. So they took

15:18.720 --> 15:23.840
the Silicon Valley model of owning the IP. So they own the IP of the berry and then they contract

15:23.840 --> 15:27.760
out production. And part of that chapter is I wanted to tell people a lot of the produce you

15:27.760 --> 15:31.520
consume now is moved offshore because of these trade agreements where you can exploit labor,

15:31.520 --> 15:35.520
exploit the environment. So, you know what I mean? How can you compete on price against

15:35.520 --> 15:42.480
a 12 year old picking berries in like Baja, Mexico? Okay. Now I have to dwell on the question of IP.

15:42.480 --> 15:46.800
You said there's IP in the berries, intellectual property. Now I'm used to that in Hollywood,

15:46.880 --> 15:51.600
right? Like Batman is IP, you know? And so if I want to write a Batman movie, well,

15:51.600 --> 15:55.440
guess what? I got to get permission. And also I'm not that important as the screenwriter or

15:55.440 --> 15:59.760
the director. Batman's the star, right? Even the actor isn't that important. So IP is a real problem

15:59.760 --> 16:06.800
where I work. What is the IP for the berry? Is the IP the name Driscoll's? Is it the,

16:06.800 --> 16:11.760
or is it the berry itself? What the fuck are you talking about? Both. Because they want a branded

16:11.760 --> 16:15.520
product. I mean, Driscoll's is kind of the first branded produce thing. Like you can't think of

16:16.000 --> 16:22.080
name a branded Apple company. You really can't. But on top of it, I can name Apple varieties.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.200
You're right. I can't, and I know some of those are proprietary, but I can't name

16:25.200 --> 16:29.520
a company. I can name Chiquita Banana. That's one that I can think of that's maybe older.

16:30.320 --> 16:35.360
But the key thing is, it's really about durability. What's really fascinating about Driscoll's,

16:35.360 --> 16:38.960
it's really, you almost kind of have to blame Walmart. Like Walmart is the king of kings

16:38.960 --> 16:43.200
and the creation of one robber baron makes other robber barons where Driscoll's saw the rise of

16:43.200 --> 16:48.080
Walmart coming and realized Walmart wants one company to do four berries year round for 4,000

16:48.080 --> 16:53.040
stores. And so that berry is not engineered for taste. So they patent, they make special types

16:53.040 --> 16:57.280
of berries that either sometimes they're gone to Morocco, sometimes in Baja, sometimes in Chile,

16:57.280 --> 17:02.480
but it's all about durability. How can you make that berry last as long as possible as it goes from

17:02.480 --> 17:06.720
you know, Chile up to Vermont. Right. And those Driscoll's berries, like they taste

17:07.600 --> 17:13.600
not great. I mean, you know, I was lucky enough, my parents gardened when I was a kid and we

17:13.600 --> 17:17.200
would have strawberries fresh from the garden. They taste so strawberry either. Incredible,

17:17.200 --> 17:22.160
you know, Driscoll's berries are like, you're like, I'm getting a, I'm getting a hint of strawberry.

17:22.160 --> 17:28.720
I waft it, a wafting under my nose when I bite into this watery pink white berry, you know,

17:28.720 --> 17:34.480
it's better than nothing. It's okay on corn flakes, but it's not like a berry berry. Right.

17:34.480 --> 17:38.320
But that's the story of the food system is nothing tastes good anymore. I mean, that is like

17:38.320 --> 17:42.560
writing this chapter, you know, I did a little tastings like, so I love milk, shocking.

17:44.720 --> 17:49.200
Sorry, sorry, sorry. No, no, no, no, you look like a milk drinker. You look like a milk guy. I'm

17:49.200 --> 17:53.040
a white boy from Iowa. Yeah, of course I'm gonna love my milk, but like inputs matter,

17:53.040 --> 17:56.880
like inputs matter and like cow and pasture is going to make a very different tasting milk than

17:56.880 --> 18:01.920
like an industrial cow inside a metal shed or in baker's field, you know, eating corn all day.

18:01.920 --> 18:06.000
And that's a story across the food system. And on top of it, industry will love to say this makes

18:06.000 --> 18:10.080
cheap food. That's not factually true. That's like maybe my favorite little factoid writing this

18:10.080 --> 18:13.840
book is, oh, these are concentrated markets, concentrated markets, gouge, that's what they

18:13.840 --> 18:18.320
do and we see rampant gouging across the food system. So we're paying more for garbage. Like

18:18.320 --> 18:23.040
that is what blows my mind. Yeah, those just goes berries are not like cheap. They're still,

18:23.040 --> 18:27.600
you know, berries are expensive to buy in the grocery store still. You don't get many, you know,

18:27.600 --> 18:31.920
you pay, I don't know, like eight bucks a little tiny thing of blueberries last year,

18:31.920 --> 18:37.280
you know, a smoothie and a half. You know, it's not, it's just like, I mean, but the thing is

18:37.280 --> 18:42.880
this system is done by design. Like my maybe the hardest chapter, right? But one of my second

18:42.880 --> 18:48.080
favorites is my farm by grain bearing chapter about the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill heavily

18:48.080 --> 18:52.640
subsidizes grains. So it makes highly processed food cheap. But if you grow produce, you don't get

18:52.640 --> 18:57.360
anything. And it also pushes people to grow grains and not produce. So it pushed produce

18:57.360 --> 19:02.000
off the shore of America to other countries. And when supply chains get long, transparency

19:02.000 --> 19:05.920
collapses. Like it's so stupid, but like part of the reason why I wrote that was I read an article

19:05.920 --> 19:11.840
15 years ago where 70% of apple juice in America comes from China. Really? 70% of apple juice

19:11.840 --> 19:18.480
in America comes from China. But I mean, American apple farming is still big. There's like America

19:18.560 --> 19:21.840
makes a lot of apples. I get them in the grocery store. Many of them are good.

19:22.880 --> 19:26.720
So why would the apple juice be produced in China when we're growing apples here?

19:26.720 --> 19:30.640
Because then the biggest part of apples is labor. It's cheaper to hire someone over there,

19:30.640 --> 19:34.480
ship liquid across the world. I mean, we still produce a lot of apples, but not as much as you

19:34.480 --> 19:38.800
think. I mean, it's kind of, if you go to Trader Joe's, look at the back of every juice. You'll

19:38.800 --> 19:44.160
notice a lot of them will say, Turkey, you know, pick your country. It's a labor component. It's

19:44.800 --> 19:49.440
as we rave standards of living for farm workers here, it undermines, you know, it kind of pushes

19:49.440 --> 19:54.240
people off. And even in Iowa, most of the orchards are gone that I grew up with, but they're not

19:54.240 --> 19:57.200
subdivisions. They're just more corn and soybeans because that's where more of the subsidies are

19:57.200 --> 20:03.200
going to. You know, and I've known for a while that we covered on my Netflix show the G word,

20:03.200 --> 20:07.040
the fact that we subsidize certain foods and not others and that we subsidize these grains.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.160
And the story that we presented is that it's somewhat of a historical accident that we

20:12.160 --> 20:18.320
subsidize those particular grains as opposed to any other crops. And we don't subsidize healthy

20:18.320 --> 20:23.200
fruits and vegetables. This is a very, it's a very simple story. We told it on television,

20:23.200 --> 20:28.320
so it had to be sort of simple and quick. It's one I've read elsewhere. I did not realize that

20:28.320 --> 20:33.520
that story though meant that we were, I thought we were just producing less vegetables, not that it

20:33.520 --> 20:39.840
was getting pushed offshore. That's wild. Like if I'm buying broccoli or whatever, it's like more

20:39.840 --> 20:46.080
likely now to come from a different country entirely. Yes. It took me a while to kind of,

20:47.200 --> 20:51.360
I love, do you know what they're like census for people? Well, USA does its own agriculture

20:51.360 --> 20:56.560
census and every seven years they do it. And you start pulling to the data and you just notice,

20:56.560 --> 21:00.960
oh, there's some weird trend lines going on here. And even something simple as during the new deal,

21:02.000 --> 21:05.360
one of the things they did, the workers progress administration is they commissioned state guides

21:05.360 --> 21:09.680
they called them. I almost think of Wikipedia mixed with like travel. I was reading the Iowa one

21:09.680 --> 21:13.360
and I was reading about all these different regional food productions. You're like, wait,

21:13.360 --> 21:18.240
there used to be tons of peaches in Iowa. There used to be tons of onions. So food supply chains used

21:18.240 --> 21:23.040
to be much more regional. And part of it is, to be fair, part of it is refrigeration. Refrigeration

21:23.040 --> 21:28.000
was a game changer. It extended supply chains. But what this system does is it really pushes

21:28.000 --> 21:33.120
people to specialize, but it makes them incredibly fragile. So like that's what happens is like you

21:33.120 --> 21:37.360
used to just see like Del Mar Peninsula used to do a lot of the produce for the East Coast.

21:37.360 --> 21:41.760
The Delta used to do some produce for the South. Now, ever all your strawberries in America used to

21:41.760 --> 21:45.040
come from California. Well, now it's starting to shift away to Baja. You know what I mean? Like

21:45.040 --> 21:47.840
California is increasingly nuts because that's just pure capital intensive.

21:47.840 --> 21:52.240
Right. Like, sorry, when you say California is nuts, you're not referring to the craziness of

21:52.240 --> 21:58.480
life in California, which I can vouch to. Let me be clear. Things are pretty wild here in the state

21:58.560 --> 22:03.200
of which I live. Now, you're talking about in California, which is a huge agricultural state,

22:03.200 --> 22:09.200
they are now mostly growing nuts. And part of that is because nuts are easily like financialized.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.640
Like you can ship them really easily. They're worth a lot of money. Like almonds are very,

22:12.640 --> 22:18.560
they're calorie dense. They are also money dense per unit of almond, right? Yep, totally. And then

22:18.560 --> 22:21.600
it's easy to harvest. You don't really need people. They just have machines that can do a lot of the

22:21.600 --> 22:25.920
work. So you don't need to pay someone to go up there and pull down the fruit. But that means

22:25.920 --> 22:31.840
that a state like mine that used to have used farming used to be a big part of its economy

22:31.840 --> 22:36.800
that people actually worked in. And that there's the famous farm worker unionization efforts of

22:36.800 --> 22:43.040
the last century. Like it's part of the history of the state, the fucking dust bowl migration,

22:43.040 --> 22:48.720
all this shit. This is like part of what California is. Now it's just the same amount of land,

22:48.720 --> 22:53.840
but it's being used with these giant machines to farm almonds just for a couple of people to

22:53.840 --> 22:57.200
profit at the top rather than something that's benefiting everybody in the economy. Yeah, in

22:57.200 --> 23:01.600
California, speaking of nuts, so it's just, it's a different food system. And it took me as a

23:01.600 --> 23:06.000
Midwesterner a while to get my head around. Like there's a lot of problems with like the

23:06.000 --> 23:10.240
homestead act and stuff, but it established like de concentrated power, especially in land holdings.

23:10.240 --> 23:14.720
California, on the other hand, has always been colonial. Like you drive the central valleys,

23:14.720 --> 23:20.480
you don't see farmhouses in the fields. And like, right, you start, I mean, you write a book like

23:20.480 --> 23:23.600
this, there's so much stuff that ends up in the cutting room floor. I got obsessed with the water

23:23.600 --> 23:28.240
stuff in California. Like the whole Imperial Valley makes no sense to me. Yeah, I mean,

23:29.120 --> 23:35.920
yeah, it's crazy the way water has been redirected across the state, specifically to the in the most

23:35.920 --> 23:40.720
popular state in the country. And by the way, I live in the most populous county in the country

23:40.720 --> 23:46.080
as well, which is enormously thirsty of water, constantly in a drought state. But part of that

23:46.080 --> 23:51.440
is because so much the water is directed to these farms that are owned again by one or two people

23:51.440 --> 23:57.600
as their sort of personal wealth creation. Do you cover the, you cover the Resnicks in the book?

23:57.600 --> 24:02.400
So I knew you're going to say that. I have a whole B list of Barons that didn't make the cut.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.000
There's already been a lot of good. You're calling the Resnicks B list Barons,

24:06.000 --> 24:11.680
the almond and pomegranate Barons of California. You're calling them B list. Hey, screw you,

24:11.680 --> 24:17.520
man. These are these are great. These are some of the greatest robber Barons in the American economy.

24:17.600 --> 24:22.880
Stuart Resnick and his wife, whose name I forget, they steal water from all across the state.

24:22.880 --> 24:29.280
They're like making huge amounts of almond milk. Caliphia almond milk is them. Pome wonderful is

24:29.280 --> 24:34.320
them. They've created company towns across of like where they, you know, force people to live

24:35.120 --> 24:40.800
like on their property, right? They're horrible people. And I can't believe they didn't make

24:40.800 --> 24:44.000
your list. I've insulted as someone who lives in California. You want to hear the

24:44.000 --> 24:47.680
Resnick on your list? Have you seen my ass? Have you seen their new product?

24:48.480 --> 24:53.920
What is their new product? Seedless lemons. Seedless lemons?

24:53.920 --> 24:57.520
Because Americans, they're too lazy. They don't like the seed in their lemons. So like,

24:58.080 --> 25:01.680
there's something evil. Like, this is the weirdest thing to say. Some of these Barons,

25:01.680 --> 25:05.440
you have to kind of admire like the bullshit of it all. Like, that's kind of brilliant.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.920
And it's, I mean, that's the funny thing about writing this book. Sorry, I shouldn't say funny,

25:09.920 --> 25:13.920
but people tell me, oh, you got, when I was in Minnesota, like, you got, let me tell you about

25:13.920 --> 25:18.160
this potato baron. When I was in Indianapolis, they told me about this carrot baron. You're just

25:18.160 --> 25:24.480
like, it's so ridiculous that we have this. I mean, the Resnicks are, it sounds weird when I wrote,

25:24.480 --> 25:28.320
when I structured this book, I wanted to mix up the narrative. So I have trashy money, then I go

25:28.320 --> 25:31.680
aristocratic money, then trashy. You know what I mean? Like, you don't want to do the same story

25:31.680 --> 25:36.640
over and over. The Resnicks kind of have this, they're like Cargill to me. They have this like

25:36.640 --> 25:40.880
Greenwich, like they understand image construction in a way that my hog bearing doesn't give a

25:40.880 --> 25:47.760
fuck about. Yeah. Yeah, they're very, they make themselves look good, right? There's a lot of,

25:47.760 --> 25:53.200
they do a lot of donations and things like that. They make themselves look like upstanding pillars

25:53.200 --> 25:57.840
of the community. Even in the products themselves, I mean, these people are one of the pioneers of

25:57.840 --> 26:05.200
almond milk. And, you know, almond milk is wildly popular. And it is not great environmentally,

26:05.200 --> 26:09.520
right? Because the almonds take so much water to make. It's like, you know, a bunch of almond,

26:09.520 --> 26:13.200
but then it just, it's just almond plus water. And it took water to grow the almonds.

26:14.560 --> 26:20.080
But they have like the, you know, the Caliphia almond bottle. It looks so wholesome and happy.

26:20.080 --> 26:24.480
Oh, there's no, there's no cows involved. So it's good for me. Like it's got a, it's got a halo to

26:24.480 --> 26:29.680
it. Oh, my favorite, I mean, their best product is obviously Fiji water. Oh, they're Fiji water as

26:29.680 --> 26:34.480
well. I forgot about that. Let's ship water from halfway across the world and branded as bougie

26:34.480 --> 26:38.400
and like sell people for like, you know, that's, that's where we are right now.

26:39.120 --> 26:43.520
Hey folks, this week's sponsor is one of my favorites on this show. I endorse them whole

26:43.520 --> 26:48.240
heartedly. And in fact, I have been using their product since long before this podcast even existed.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.680
That's right. I'm talking about delete me. You know, you might not want to hear this,

26:51.680 --> 26:56.800
but it has got to be said, your data is out there. There is a whole thriving ecosystem of

26:56.800 --> 27:02.640
data brokers, people who collect, buy and sell our personal information on the internet right

27:02.640 --> 27:06.720
now. That means your name, your phone number, your home address, the names of your relatives

27:06.720 --> 27:11.200
and your friends is almost certainly out there waiting to be snapped up by anyone with an

27:11.200 --> 27:14.800
internet connection. These sites are real. I have been to them myself and I've seen my own

27:14.800 --> 27:19.520
information on them. And I've talked before about how exposed I felt when I realized that

27:19.520 --> 27:23.680
people were literally buying my home phone number from these data brokers. And frankly,

27:23.680 --> 27:28.080
I wouldn't wish that feeling on anyone. It was after that incident that I signed up for delete

27:28.080 --> 27:32.960
me and I have not regretted it even for an instant ever since. But since then, the prevalence of

27:32.960 --> 27:37.520
harassment and online bullying has only seemed to escalate. It seems like every single week I hear

27:37.520 --> 27:41.840
a story about a real life incident that began as an argument or interaction between two strangers

27:41.840 --> 27:47.520
on the internet or about some kind of stalking that began online. You deserve to feel secure and

27:47.520 --> 27:51.760

27:51.760 --> 27:55.760
phishing attempts being sent to your email or strangers, knowing how to find your front door

27:55.760 --> 28:00.160

28:28.080 --> 28:34.160
It's true. Listen, that's the sound of you mastering a new language with Babel. Learning a new language

28:34.160 --> 28:38.080
can be one of the toughest yet most rewarding challenges out there. So if you are ready to

28:38.080 --> 28:42.400
dive in, make sure you're using the right tools to get the job done. A lot of language apps are

28:42.400 --> 28:46.640
really just kind of games that are dressed up to make you feel like you're learning. Babel is

28:46.640 --> 28:52.000
different though. It is the real deal. Lessons in Babel are crafted by real people for real

28:52.000 --> 28:56.880
conversation. They're approachable with tips and tools that are all based in real life and framed

28:56.880 --> 29:02.240
around conversation based teaching from minute one. Babel is concerned with helping you get out there

29:02.240 --> 29:06.960
and put a new language into practice in the real world. I mean, look, I've lived in Los Angeles

29:06.960 --> 29:12.480
for years and a ton of people here speak Spanish and starting Spanish with Babel has been rewarding

29:12.480 --> 29:16.880
to me in ways that I didn't even anticipate. I mean, sure, it's made chatting with neighbors and

29:16.880 --> 29:20.800
ordering food and enjoying cultural events easier to do, but more importantly, it's also just

29:20.800 --> 29:25.840
enriched my experience of living in Los Angeles and has made me feel more connected to my community

29:25.840 --> 29:30.720
in a way I didn't expect. It makes me excited to learn more and see what else it opens up for me.

29:30.720 --> 29:35.200
Now, that's just my experience. But studies from Yale, Michigan State University and others

29:35.200 --> 29:40.560
have shown that Babel is effective. One study even found that using Babel for 15 hours is equivalent

29:40.560 --> 29:45.280
to a full semester of a college language course. And look, I can't promise that it'll be easy,

29:45.280 --> 29:50.720
but I can promise you'll be glad you did it. And get this, here is a special limited time deal

29:50.720 --> 29:55.200

30:08.400 --> 30:11.840
Yeah. And speaking of shipping, you know, these liquids halfway across the world,

30:11.840 --> 30:17.760
I mean, it's ridiculous to be shipping so much food across the country or across the world in

30:19.200 --> 30:24.720
cargo containers, right? I think about this every time I drink a Pellegrino and I like

30:24.720 --> 30:28.240
a Pellegrino. It makes me feel classy, you know, to have a sparkling water at dinner.

30:28.320 --> 30:32.800
But I'm like, a La Croix just comes from Wisconsin. Why do I need it shipped from Italy,

30:32.800 --> 30:37.040
right? That's a lot more fossil fuels to have just like water brought from one place to another.

30:37.040 --> 30:41.760
There's water here, motherfuckers. Like, why do I need it to come on a boat? And the same thing

30:41.760 --> 30:45.440
is, it has to be true of apple juice and all these other products as well, right?

30:45.440 --> 30:48.960
Yeah, because it's all about exploiting labor. I mean, it's this whole neoliberal trade stuff.

30:48.960 --> 30:52.880
I mean, that is the trade component to the food system has been really underappreciated. I mean,

30:53.360 --> 30:58.960
even if you go back to Baja and the berries, these are like, it's hard to use these words,

30:58.960 --> 31:03.600
like almost like plantations, because people don't live a Baja. It's very sparsely populated.

31:03.600 --> 31:07.680
It gets as much rain as Death Valley three inches a year. They bring in indigenous workers from

31:07.680 --> 31:13.040
Oaxaca. It's so dangerous to go report this to be a journalist down there. They're plantations,

31:13.040 --> 31:15.680
you know what I mean? They build desolidation plants on the ocean. They pull up the water,

31:15.680 --> 31:18.960
they drain the aquifers. The people there don't eat the berries, they're for rich,

31:18.960 --> 31:21.200
you know, they're for upper class Americans at Costco.

31:21.200 --> 31:24.640
Wow. So they're literally, they're almost like terraforming,

31:24.640 --> 31:29.680
like they're doing it on the surface of Mars or something. I mean, Baja California is a wonderful

31:29.680 --> 31:32.880
place, but it's not suited to this kind of agriculture. They're just like, oh, here's

31:32.880 --> 31:37.040
some cheap land with some cheap people. Let's just like get some water from somewhere else

31:37.040 --> 31:39.920
or drain it out of the aquifer and we can grow our cash crop.

31:39.920 --> 31:44.080
Yeah. It's that financialization, short term, private equity kind of thing where,

31:44.080 --> 31:47.040
I mean, you get a massive amount of pig production in the Oklahoma Panhandle,

31:47.040 --> 31:50.720
where like the dust bowl took place and pigs are thirsty or even you go to fucking,

31:50.720 --> 31:54.240
sorry, you go to baker's field and it's like massive amount of dairy, dairy going on there.

31:54.240 --> 31:57.520
And you're like, this doesn't make sense. I see an oil rig next to a dairy cow standing

31:57.520 --> 32:04.480
in sand in the desert. Yeah. I mean, every time, you know, drive that freeway route from LA to

32:04.480 --> 32:08.080
San Francisco, it's like the most, it's the weirdest part of the whole drive. You go through

32:08.080 --> 32:13.120
that sea of cows and it was like something is not right here and also the air smells bad.

32:13.120 --> 32:17.760
Yeah. I mean, like, but people don't realize that is dairy existed in Vermont, Wisconsin,

32:17.760 --> 32:22.400
upstate New York for a reason. It made environmental logical sense. When you put it in the desert,

32:23.520 --> 32:28.320
New Mexico does three times more dairy than Vermont now. And it's all over on the eastern

32:28.320 --> 32:33.360
side by Texas near Clover. And it's just, these are industrial feedlots. And I mean,

32:33.360 --> 32:36.640
dairy's really scary because these guys are kind of like feudal lords too because

32:36.640 --> 32:40.880
they employ, it takes a lot of undocumented men to run these empires. They're usually also the

32:40.880 --> 32:44.000
landlords. So they're both an employer and the landlords are usually the largest employer in the

32:44.000 --> 32:48.240
county. I talked about my dairy bear and created that milk fair life. I don't know if you've ever

32:48.240 --> 32:54.320
seen, it's like that branded milk in the grocery store. Coke just bought it for him. It's twice

32:54.320 --> 32:59.520
the cost, half the volume of normal milk because it has high protein content. So young men love it.

33:01.360 --> 33:06.000
It's, that's where we are. And when you say that, let's talk more about the financialization,

33:06.000 --> 33:11.440
like that this is driven by the market, driven by private equity. How much is that the case?

33:11.440 --> 33:15.680
Is it, yeah, describe how that process might work. I mean, part of it is, so like intellectual,

33:15.680 --> 33:19.600
I came at this of you, to me, I really believe you have to understand how someone amassed power

33:19.600 --> 33:24.960
to deconstruct it. And like, there's this, the simple stupid story is, oh, this was efficiency,

33:24.960 --> 33:29.600
this was technology. But when you actually step back and you dig into it, you're like, no,

33:29.600 --> 33:34.640
this is an old fashioned story of a combination of regulatory capture and access to cheap capital.

33:34.640 --> 33:38.880
My hog Baron, he saw the industrial model taking hold, he was building some of those

33:38.880 --> 33:42.800
metal sheds, he got some Wall Street money, and he was able to essentially get big when you saw

33:42.800 --> 33:46.480
market changing. And then he established his market dominance. And then with that dominance,

33:46.480 --> 33:50.560
he's able to essentially set the regulatory structure. Like he's given that money to the

33:50.560 --> 33:54.640
governor of Iowa, that much money, because his whole empire is Iowa, he needs to control Iowa,

33:54.640 --> 33:58.640
because the second you regulate hog manure, like human manure, his models no longer economically

33:58.640 --> 34:03.440
viable, like, I can't say this, this fact blows my mind where like, I was 25 million hogs now,

34:03.440 --> 34:08.080
and a hog defecates three times more than us. That's the manure of 75 million people. That's

34:08.080 --> 34:12.640
California, Texas, Illinois combined. And that regulatory structure is gutted. Like there's

34:12.640 --> 34:18.240
how many people live in Iowa? Three, three million, three million. So you got three million people

34:18.240 --> 34:23.760
doing three million pounds of people shit. And then you've got 25 million hogs doing the equivalent

34:23.760 --> 34:31.520
of 75 million pounds of people shit. Yes. So you're saying Iowa is something like what like

34:31.840 --> 34:41.040
like, like, like seven eighths shit. Yes. Excuse me, excuse me, Iowans, but like the math there

34:41.040 --> 34:46.400
is boggling my mind. It's the waterways in Iowa and open to her. Wow. No, I was gonna say like

34:46.400 --> 34:50.480
seven percent of the waterways are too toxic to go into. You see these, there's manure lagoons

34:50.480 --> 34:53.760
underneath them, and they occasionally leak, and you're like, no city would occasionally

34:53.760 --> 34:57.360
leak human manure everywhere. And you know what I mean? It's such a fact of life. Yeah. And so you

34:57.360 --> 35:02.560
say that the hog manure, despite there being many times more, we're talking 20 times more of it than

35:02.560 --> 35:08.640
there is a human manure. Human shit is regulated. It can only be put certain places. It has to be

35:08.640 --> 35:13.040
treated certain ways, not the case with hog shit. Yes. I mean, my favorite little example of this is

35:13.680 --> 35:17.920
I go to, I fly a lot. It's like these coasts for like different stuff. And I, there's no

35:17.920 --> 35:21.920
straight flight out of Iowa, shocking. And when I do that flight between Cedar Rapids and Chicago,

35:22.480 --> 35:26.560
you're flying, especially in the winter, you fly over snow fields, fields covered in snow. And

35:26.640 --> 35:30.240
you'll just see hog shit. Because what they do is they, every few months, you have to drain it. And

35:30.240 --> 35:32.960
you're not really supposed to drain it and put it on snow in the winter. Because then when the snow

35:32.960 --> 35:36.800
melts, it goes straight into the water. They do it. It's an, everyone knows they do it, and they

35:36.800 --> 35:40.960
don't get fined for it. It's an open secret. But the worst one's actually in North Carolina,

35:40.960 --> 35:45.600
because this is where the hog model comes out of, was a state senator deregulated this industry

35:45.600 --> 35:51.360
in the eighties first. And he did it in the poor black areas. And because of the water table in

35:51.360 --> 35:55.360
North Carolina and Iowa, they injected into the soil they put on top of it. In North Carolina,

35:55.360 --> 36:00.720
they spray it into the air, the manure. So there's all these stories of spray it into the air.

36:00.720 --> 36:04.960
Like, like they're watering the land. Wow. And so all the, and so there's stories of,

36:04.960 --> 36:08.080
oh yeah, stories of these poor black churches having to repaint their steeples every few years

36:08.080 --> 36:14.960
because they turn brown. Jesus Christ. Just turn brown from the hog shit. Yeah. You can't, I mean,

36:14.960 --> 36:20.960
it's, people don't realize how the, how much destructive the quality of life is. And the way

36:20.960 --> 36:25.040
these things, they're so, these states are so captured, you can't stop the construction of

36:25.040 --> 36:28.720
these confinements when they go up. So your home is your everything in America. It's your wealth.

36:28.720 --> 36:33.520
If one of those metal sheds full of piggies get built, you're fucked. Like, you can't do anything

36:33.520 --> 36:37.280
about it. And it just destroys your wealth, destroys your quality of life. It traps you inside.

36:37.840 --> 36:43.200
And one thing that really strikes me is how invisible this has become to mainstream America,

36:43.200 --> 36:47.920
because you've got the destruction of the family farmer. That means that, well, you've got like

36:47.920 --> 36:53.040
one guy owning an entire part of the food system. And then everyone working for him,

36:53.040 --> 36:58.000
as you say, is an undocumented immigrant, someone with, you know, who's maybe here short term,

36:58.000 --> 37:01.840
or maybe they don't speak English. They're, you know, they're not, they're not able to vote.

37:01.840 --> 37:07.520
They're not, or they're living on some sort of weird company town, often, you know, the,

37:07.520 --> 37:11.600
the central valley of California or Baja California, well, that's a different, different

37:11.600 --> 37:16.480
country, but you get my point. And the people eating the food have no visibility because

37:16.480 --> 37:20.880
there's been this, like, disconnect between the people making it and the people eating it.

37:21.760 --> 37:24.960
Is that, does that sound right to you? Totally. I mean, like, to me, the bigger

37:24.960 --> 37:29.760
tooth, just to add on to that is like one, you have local news collapse in these, in places

37:29.760 --> 37:34.160
like Iowa. I mean, the one retro got gutted by private equity, Sinclair owns most of the TV stations.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.680
So these stories aren't being told, they're not being reported out. So then the Robert

37:37.680 --> 37:41.280
Barron essentially creates his own narrative. Like, I kind of think of Iowa, rural America,

37:41.280 --> 37:45.600
now is like an extraction colony where the, like, the colonizers set the narrative.

37:46.560 --> 37:50.080
Right. So these stories aren't told. And on top of that, you have a lot of news outlets in New

37:50.080 --> 37:53.920
York City want to talk about what's the new high end restaurant. Like, there's not these structural

37:53.920 --> 37:57.840
undercurrent stories. It's like, what's the new vegan restaurant in Brooklyn, you know?

37:58.640 --> 38:02.480
Yeah, that's food journalism. Yeah. Yes. But it's easy. It's cheap. And on top of it,

38:02.480 --> 38:07.040
my hog baron has his own spokeswoman. So like, there's this whole propaganda apparatus that

38:07.040 --> 38:11.360
just licks them up and down all day. And I mean, my favorite, sorry, my favorite little,

38:11.360 --> 38:15.200
my husband, I have these gay little sassy lines in the book I kind of love. And

38:17.200 --> 38:23.200
in my hog baron chapter, Mike, Mike Rowe did a dirty jobs episode on my hog, my dairy baron.

38:24.240 --> 38:28.240
I love that. By the way, you keep saying my hog baron, my dairy baron. You're really attached

38:28.240 --> 38:33.200
to these people. You love them. I feel like you're, I just imagine you in your home,

38:33.200 --> 38:37.120
like just with their pictures on the wall, like little shrines to them everywhere. Like,

38:37.120 --> 38:41.200
you love these people. Oh, I'm like, I had a, actually a writer buddy of mine called me out on

38:41.200 --> 38:45.680
that a few months ago, too, because it's had, I mean, I spent five years on this and I read

38:45.680 --> 38:50.640
thousands of articles just to kind of get my head around it. Yeah. You get a vibe. You get a flavor

38:50.640 --> 38:54.560
of them. You just kind of get to know what type of person they are. And like, I know that type

38:54.560 --> 38:59.680
of guy, my dairy barons, I call them Bubba's, just that arrogant white guy that thinks they build

38:59.680 --> 39:03.520
everything. I mean, so many of these guys cosplay as farmers, but they're really capital asset

39:03.520 --> 39:08.480
managers. And like, he goes on dirty jobs, sells his narrative of being a farmer. And then I dig

39:08.480 --> 39:12.560
into it and you're like, Oh, you actually claim residency at the Ritz Carlton, Puerto Rico,

39:12.560 --> 39:18.960
probably to evade capital income taxes. And then like, and then my line on that,

39:20.000 --> 39:24.320
my line is Mike Rowe sold his narrative. Like he used to sell products on QVC.

39:25.040 --> 39:32.560
Because it's just like, yeah, Mike Rowe, the guy from Dirty Jobs famously, if people don't know,

39:33.520 --> 39:38.000
you know, part of the right wing information machine, like he's, you know, been funded for

39:38.000 --> 39:43.200
years by all the biggest right wing billionaires and, you know, pushing, has always pushed a

39:43.200 --> 39:46.960
really pro corporate message on that show and on his other products, which is, you know,

39:46.960 --> 39:53.920
that's his right to do as a communicator. I push a narrative that I find more true than that. But

39:54.000 --> 39:58.160
that is, that is his ideological and historical role in the world.

39:58.160 --> 40:04.640
Yeah. I mean, I did your thing. I didn't know that though. I just, I was in an Oklahoma watching

40:04.640 --> 40:09.120
a Top Gun a few years ago. I was like there for something. I was at a theater and he cut an

40:09.120 --> 40:12.880
ad before the movie, seeing how great fracking was for Oklahoma. But it was like the most

40:12.880 --> 40:17.520
delusional ad I've ever seen. And you're like, because he's one of those people, my parents

40:17.520 --> 40:20.400
always have them on like, it's like storage or just kind of on in the background.

40:21.040 --> 40:26.000
Yeah. It's a good show. It's got this hidden ideological message that people don't usually

40:26.000 --> 40:30.160
appreciate. That and like, to me, the truth was so obvious. That's what actually bothered me the

40:30.160 --> 40:35.600
most about the Dairy Baron is they got a lot of press for how environmental sustainable they were.

40:36.160 --> 40:39.680
And you just go to their operation. It's about an hour south of Gary, Indiana.

40:39.680 --> 40:44.800
And it's just so obviously wrong. Like, I've never seen a Midwest cornfield with canals around it.

40:44.800 --> 40:48.800
You're like, wait, what's going on here? And you Wikipedia, literally Wikipedia,

40:48.800 --> 40:52.640
and this was an old wetlands. It was Everglades at the North. Teddy Roosevelt used to go hunting

40:52.640 --> 40:57.360
here. This shouldn't be in row cropping production. And to do intensive dairy work,

40:57.360 --> 41:02.400
dairy cows, we talk about hogs maneuvering a lot. Dairy cows do an insane amount more

41:02.400 --> 41:07.920
where that dairy operation he's a part of has about 35,000 cows. Those cows do as much manure

41:07.920 --> 41:11.600
in a day as the city of Austin, Texas. Wow. He's doing that in a wetland.

41:11.600 --> 41:16.400
I mean, well, so let's talk again about the people who are doing the work for these guys.

41:17.280 --> 41:22.800
Because, look, I mean, Trump is out there right now saying he's going to deport every

41:23.520 --> 41:29.040
undocumented immigrant in America. But that's his policy. He wants to deport all of them.

41:29.040 --> 41:34.480
And Biden has moved far to the right on immigration. There's almost a growing consensus

41:34.480 --> 41:41.440
about like deportation. At the same time, our food system is built entirely on the backs of

41:41.440 --> 41:48.400
these undocumented workers who are doing work that no middle class American would ever agree to do

41:48.400 --> 41:55.920
at the wages that are being paid. And part of the work was basically invented for undocumented

41:55.920 --> 42:02.240
people to be underpaid doing. And so how does that interact with our politics? I mean, just tell me

42:02.240 --> 42:06.080
about that piece of it. It seems insane to talk about deporting these people when like,

42:06.080 --> 42:10.800
where would you get your fucking driscals? That is the irony of it all. I mean,

42:10.800 --> 42:15.040
my Dairy Baron gave a massive trek to Trump right after the excess Hollywood tape came out.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.920
But it's like, dude, you're all empires and documented workers. I mean, even writing this

42:17.920 --> 42:24.160
book, I discovered a worker died in his manure pit. Wow. It was a Honduras man, had three children,

42:24.160 --> 42:28.960
it was never reported. It took me like two, three years to get the death records on him because

42:28.960 --> 42:34.000
the power he wields in the county. That's the irony of it all. I mean, that's a thing I wrestled

42:34.000 --> 42:38.240
with writing in the coffee chapter was, and I think this has been lost history is

42:38.480 --> 42:46.400
the role monopolists play in financing fascists. And I danced around that in the book where Tim

42:46.400 --> 42:49.920
Wu had this good book called Curse of Bigness, where he kind of mentioned it briefly. Yeah,

42:49.920 --> 42:53.440
that book's incredible. Yeah. That's where I got a bunch of the argument that I told you about

42:53.440 --> 42:57.280
Robert Borker from. Yeah. Yeah. And so he, but he had this little nugget in there that I dug

42:57.280 --> 43:02.080
more into. After World War II, a big part of America's reconstruction in Japan and Europe was

43:02.080 --> 43:05.920
trust busting. Like Congress commissioned a report and they're like, how did this happen?

43:06.640 --> 43:10.800
One of the key findings were monopolist finance fascists. Hitler's largest owner was a company

43:10.800 --> 43:14.640
called IG Farben. IG Farben was a chemical company. Hitler comes into a room and goes,

43:14.640 --> 43:18.560
oh, I'll help you sell more chemicals, whatever. I don't mean all the crazy rhetoric. They cut

43:18.560 --> 43:23.120
him a check. They sell him chemicals, including chemicals using gas chambers. That company's

43:23.120 --> 43:27.200
broken up into seven. One of the modern day companies that was broken up into is, is, uh,

43:27.200 --> 43:31.280
Bermont Santo. I just think that history is so important, especially now. And I think

43:31.280 --> 43:35.760
because I'm from Iowa, I kind of saw where it all fell apart. Like Iowa should be the Italy

43:35.760 --> 43:39.200
of North America. It should be the Napa. It should be where you go for food tourism yet

43:39.200 --> 43:42.880
as a second highest cancer rate in America. It's one of the most obese states. The politics of

43:42.880 --> 43:46.880
rage have filled the void of what used to be a solid middle class place of what used to be a

43:46.880 --> 43:51.840
purple state. And we don't have to go down this path, but this is the path we're on. And like,

43:51.840 --> 43:56.320
that is a goal I really wanted to have with this book is here's an honest conversation

43:56.320 --> 44:02.960
where we are, but what we could do too. That's amazing how these barons have inflamed our politics

44:02.960 --> 44:07.440
while keeping all the attention away from them, right? Like the, uh, the public, a lot of the

44:07.440 --> 44:13.920
public is so angry about illegal immigration and undocumented immigrants. But like, why are

44:13.920 --> 44:18.400
undocumented immigrants taking those jobs? Because these barons have created a job that

44:18.400 --> 44:25.680
only an undocumented immigrant would take. That that is so poor and has done so by, uh,

44:26.320 --> 44:31.120
fucking with the food system of the food that we eat. And so this is a problem that's entirely

44:31.120 --> 44:36.640
created by them. And yet the public is angry at the victims, at the people who are dying in the

44:36.640 --> 44:42.080
manure pits, uh, so that we can eat worse food, not all so that these guys on top can make more

44:42.080 --> 44:47.600
money. It's insane. The bearing that it's the scariest is because how unknown they are is actually

44:47.680 --> 44:52.160
Cargill. So Cargill is owned by the largest private company in America. They're bigger than the Koch

44:52.160 --> 44:56.400
Brothers, but no one knows who they are. I mean, I didn't even have them in my business. Like when

44:56.400 --> 45:00.480
I laid out the book and I grew up around Cargill. I was born next to a Cargill plant. I played soccer

45:00.480 --> 45:05.040
next to a Cargill plant. My church was next to a Cargill plant. And they're, they're all about

45:05.040 --> 45:09.280
owning the middle because they're not consumer-facing. You don't know who they are, but they have so

45:09.280 --> 45:13.600
much money and power. And what they do is they engage, like I call it, um, they use middle man.

45:13.600 --> 45:18.320
So they never do things overly. They pay these DC groups to do their bidding so they can play,

45:18.320 --> 45:22.400
you know, be ignorant. You don't mean to play, you know, lead, um, what sort I'm looking for,

45:22.400 --> 45:26.880
innocent, but it's currently dark. I mean, that is the fear of concentrated economic power is

45:26.880 --> 45:31.360
you just assume it corrupts the local system. Yeah. Well, let's talk more about how this affects

45:31.360 --> 45:37.520
the food that we actually eat in so many ways. Like the financialization, the monopolization

45:37.520 --> 45:42.720
has actually altered the food itself, right? I mean, if I can give you a personal example of this.

45:43.840 --> 45:49.120
I, uh, uh, last year was an upstate New York. I was on a college campus. The college campus had

45:49.120 --> 45:53.120
some apple trees. It was like a historic apple orchard on it. And so they had some apples out,

45:53.120 --> 45:57.200
like in the cafeteria, and they were like, Oh, you can have some, here's a Macintosh apple.

45:57.200 --> 46:01.600
And I took the Macintosh apple and I bit it. And I was like, this tastes nothing like a Macintosh

46:01.600 --> 46:08.960
apple I've ever had in my life. It was like crisp and juicy and had like, uh, had a complexity

46:09.040 --> 46:13.360
of flavor. It makes me sound like a food nerd. I'm not trying to be snobby about it.

46:13.360 --> 46:18.000
There was literally something going on with this apple I had not tasted before. Whereas every other

46:18.000 --> 46:22.400
Macintosh, one of the most popular apple varieties in America I had had before had tasted almost

46:22.400 --> 46:26.560
exactly the same. And you know, I'm sure this apple was fresher because it was local and da,

46:26.560 --> 46:31.520
da, da. But also I was like something about the genetics seem different. Something like

46:31.520 --> 46:36.560
everything about this apple was different to me. And it made me just reflect on there are all these

46:36.560 --> 46:41.520
ways that the mechanized, financialized food system changes what we actually eat without

46:41.520 --> 46:47.040
us realizing it until we finally have the counter example. I mean, but that's, I'm obsessed with

46:47.040 --> 46:51.520
owning the middle with this book is how radical the system has become. And like part of owning the

46:51.520 --> 46:55.040
middle and like, what we're talking about these reforms are like, Oh my God, animals should be

46:55.040 --> 46:58.800
on the land. What a radical concept. Oh, food should be grown near you. Food should taste good.

46:58.800 --> 47:03.680
People should get a decent living wage. We've gone so far off track. And I will say,

47:03.680 --> 47:08.240
as dark as this can be, what gives me hope is everyone's seen it's not working. Like the biggest,

47:08.240 --> 47:12.160
the thing that's kind of shocked me the most is how much the business traveler has taken to my book.

47:13.440 --> 47:17.920
It's like a cliche for upper class Americans to go, Oh, I went to Italy, I ate better food,

47:17.920 --> 47:22.400
I lost weight, you know, it's cheaper. Yeah, I mean, everyone's just kind of seeing it. It's

47:22.400 --> 47:28.720
not working. And yeah, that is like, I mean, I had my one on Glenn Beck's TV network recently.

47:28.720 --> 47:32.080
I mean, there's like this weird, there's this whole weird thing going to on the,

47:32.080 --> 47:37.200
on the right right now over food. I mean, it's a little raw, milky RFK.

47:37.840 --> 47:44.160
Yeah, no, but they've gotten it's sort of like the crunchy, you know, California hippies who got

47:44.160 --> 47:48.560
kind of right wing have influenced the rest of the right wingers to get a little bit more crunchy.

47:48.560 --> 47:54.080
And now they are really obsessed with the food system in a surprising way. I realized this

47:54.080 --> 47:59.280
when I did a segment about for Adam ruins everything. And it was a pretty light segment.

47:59.280 --> 48:04.080
It was just like, Hey, you can eat bugs if you want it, you know, like bugs are not that bad

48:04.080 --> 48:07.600
for you. A lot of cultures eat bugs, there's bugs in the food you already eat. It's a good

48:07.600 --> 48:12.960
source of protein, just like a fun light segment. And a bunch of right wingers, a bunch of right

48:12.960 --> 48:17.360
wing blogs freaked out. And we're like, Adam Conover says you should eat bugs. And I realized that

48:17.360 --> 48:22.960
they have some sort of like meme about how in the future we'll all be forced to eat like we're on the

48:24.160 --> 48:28.400
snowpiercer train or something. And we're going to be forced to eat, you know, soylent green or

48:28.400 --> 48:33.600
whatever. Like they're like, they have like a an apocalyptic future in mind. And I accidentally

48:33.600 --> 48:38.400
like triggered them and their fear of being forced to eat bugs. And I wasn't aware of that until

48:38.400 --> 48:42.800
that moment. I've seen ever since that was maybe five years ago, I've seen more and more of this

48:42.800 --> 48:48.560
throughout the right wing. They're like obsession with the food system and purity and back to the

48:48.560 --> 48:53.680
land and that kind of thing. Oh, I mean, just two things add on to that. One, I laugh because

48:53.680 --> 48:58.400
Cargill's getting into the bug industry. They're trying to as a protein source to feed industrial

48:58.400 --> 49:05.440
animals. So they want to as like soy, they kind of replace soybeans and corn is just feed the pigs

49:05.440 --> 49:10.400
inside these metal sheds bugs, which is like a whole new separate thing. But that's actually why

49:10.400 --> 49:14.560
I like book talks to your point, because you it's pattern recognition. You're like, why am I getting

49:14.560 --> 49:17.840
a lot of questions about raw milk? Why am I getting a lot because people come up to you, they have

49:17.840 --> 49:22.800
this conversation one on one, you're testing your rhetoric. I mean, that's actually where I get the

49:23.120 --> 49:27.200
probably gossip for the book or like tips. It's just people like, oh, you should really look over

49:27.200 --> 49:31.360
here. Like I did a book event in the hometown of my hog Baron. And it was the one time I was actually

49:31.360 --> 49:37.040
scared shitless. I put the tracking on my phone. You're scared shitless because there was so much

49:37.040 --> 49:40.480
shit surrounding you. You were ankle deep and shit. That's why you were scared shitless.

49:40.480 --> 49:45.440
Or I could be floating in the next day, you know, like some little Chinatown thing goes down.

49:46.080 --> 49:53.760
Please go on. But I was just that night I was the scariest I've been in the book tour because

49:53.760 --> 49:59.520
like, I didn't expect doing this book tour was every place an old lady would always ask me,

49:59.520 --> 50:03.760
are you worried about your safety? And honestly, I'm not in that I can say that it's honestly

50:04.560 --> 50:08.320
the beauty of America is I can write a book like this and not be worried about my safety.

50:08.320 --> 50:12.000
That said that town is like, I'm going into the heart of the beast. I'm going to a town of 5,000

50:12.000 --> 50:17.360
people and I was to do a book talk. I was shocked. We had 50 people show up and to get 50 people at

50:17.360 --> 50:24.080
a book talk in 2024 is a big deal. It was just people pissed off. And they were about more than

50:24.080 --> 50:30.080
half the room came up to me afterwards. Oh, I knew I knew Jeff and they promised me this. They did

50:30.080 --> 50:34.240
that. They did, you know, you could just see the anger and the sadness and people's face and like

50:34.240 --> 50:38.800
that's also something I've internalized writing this book is there's a degree of Stockholm syndrome

50:38.800 --> 50:42.800
in real America that I don't think urban America appreciates. A lot of people fought power and

50:42.800 --> 50:47.920
they lost and like, you can't afford to leave. It's too depressing to really grapple with this

50:47.920 --> 50:52.480
material. There's still some fighters. I opened with a book of a pissed off old woman fighting it.

50:52.480 --> 50:57.760
Usually the fighters still are pissed off old ladies in rural areas, but it's hard. But it's

50:57.760 --> 51:01.200
a weird, these people are barely getting by and you can just feel the pain. I don't know. I don't

51:01.200 --> 51:07.120
know how to describe that, but it's just something I've noticed. Yeah. Well, I think we have all

51:07.120 --> 51:12.240
felt that that there's something is deeply wrong with our food system. And, you know, we had a,

51:12.240 --> 51:16.800
you know, when we cover on the show, what has happened to us health wise because of food,

51:16.800 --> 51:22.800
the blame and to me always falls on the food system, on the capitalist food system that has,

51:22.800 --> 51:28.160
you know, given us all of these foods that are very delicious to us, but are extremely unhealthy.

51:29.040 --> 51:34.240
But more importantly, even the foods that are healthy have gotten less healthy, right? All the

51:34.240 --> 51:37.440
meats have gotten, like they're produced less healthily for the people who produced them, but

51:37.440 --> 51:41.920
also for us. Do you have any particular examples of that? And do you think that the process that

51:41.920 --> 51:46.080
you're talking about here, this baronization, this chickenization of the food system is to

51:46.080 --> 51:50.560
blame for our poor health outcomes? Oh, 100%. I mean, it takes money now to be healthy in America.

51:51.440 --> 51:55.680
Yeah. One of the hardest sections where I was actually the obesity section in my green barons

51:55.680 --> 52:00.400
chapter where it all goes back to corn and chicken, I joke. Yeah. But like,

52:00.400 --> 52:05.600
just before corn syrup really took hold in America, we didn't have, I mean, sugar was hard to do.

52:05.600 --> 52:08.640
Sugarcane has a very limited production region like Louisiana and Florida,

52:08.640 --> 52:12.320
and sugar beets actually has this weird new DL supply management system where it's like,

52:13.120 --> 52:17.200
there's quotas basically on how much you can produce. And but then the creation of corn syrup

52:17.840 --> 52:22.000
in the 70s and 80s and the highly amount of subsidies going into it just exploded the use of

52:22.000 --> 52:27.040
sugar. Julia Guthman is an academic at the University of Santa Cruz has done a lot of

52:27.120 --> 52:31.680
scholarship on this and really drove that point home. But I mean, I, I see, I mean,

52:31.680 --> 52:34.080
that's why I love going to grocery stores because you can just see the price points.

52:34.080 --> 52:37.680
You see, you walk down the pop aisle and you're like, a two litters of buck 50,

52:37.680 --> 52:43.040
but if I want carrot juice at $6, you're pushing people into it. And I don't want

52:43.040 --> 52:48.560
an interview for this book that got junked. And it's because there's this elitism among

52:48.560 --> 52:52.640
certain people where they blame the lower income person for their obesity. And I was like,

52:53.280 --> 52:56.960
you don't get it. You don't get what it's like to work two jobs, have kids,

52:57.760 --> 53:03.040
and this food is easy. It's easy to cook a frozen pizza. I mean, I, I grew up on that stuff. I mean,

53:03.040 --> 53:07.920
it's, it's hard. Yeah, it takes money to eat healthy and it takes time when people are barely

53:07.920 --> 53:12.640
getting by. Also, keep in mind, this stuff is, if you had a rough day, who isn't happy after like

53:12.640 --> 53:18.000
a box of cheezus, you know, right? And well, there's, there's a place for that, right? And,

53:18.720 --> 53:23.280
you know, the, there's a lot of concern that this sort of argument leads to a continual

53:23.280 --> 53:28.800
shaming of people eating, you know, processed foods, et cetera. There's a place for processed

53:28.800 --> 53:34.400
foods in the world, but there is also something clearly very wrong with our food system that is

53:34.400 --> 53:41.200
like hurting people and that is doing something bad to their health. And you think it's, this is

53:41.200 --> 53:46.960
what it, this is the culprit. Oh, 100%. I mean, the, the farm bill is a reflection of moral values

53:46.960 --> 53:50.960
and our farm bill is now designed for Wall Street. It's designed for PepsiCo to make chips and

53:50.960 --> 53:54.880
pop as cheap as possible at the expense of everything else. So as chips got cheaper,

53:54.880 --> 54:00.160
you know, fresh stuff, stuff got more expensive. And yeah, it's, I mean, also these supply chain

54:00.160 --> 54:04.400
lines, you know, it's even in like a lot of vegetables used to be grown in Iowa and that's

54:04.400 --> 54:08.640
gone. Um, and also when things, my husband and I were just talking about carrots today,

54:08.640 --> 54:14.320
how awful baby carrots taste. So like private equity is one of the largest grower carrots in

54:14.400 --> 54:19.200
America. Yeah. I mean, it's really funny. I've had conversations with people before, because,

54:19.200 --> 54:23.040
you know, I'm the kind of guy, I just look stuff up when I'm interacting with it. And I like looked

54:23.040 --> 54:27.600
up baby carrots once and you probably know better than me. But the story that I read was that one

54:27.600 --> 54:32.400
enterprising carrot company figured out, well, if we take the ugly carrots and we whittle them down

54:32.960 --> 54:37.200
into little carrot nubs, then, you know, that's like reproducible. The carrot doesn't need to

54:37.200 --> 54:40.800
be pretty, right? We can do that with any carrot. And then we can take the shavings and we can,

54:40.800 --> 54:45.360
you know, turn it into sugar and use it as an additive in things. And when I try to tell people

54:45.360 --> 54:50.240
this, I'm like, baby carrots are like whittled carrots. Like people will say to me in my life,

54:50.240 --> 54:55.280
they'll go, no, they're, they're baby carrots. They're like little, they're like, the carrot is

54:55.280 --> 54:59.920
a baby. They picked it while it was still a little child. I'm eating a carrot toddler. No,

54:59.920 --> 55:05.120
motherfucker, it's a whittled carrot. Somebody put that on a lathe, you know, and it turned it real

55:05.120 --> 55:10.400
fast to like shrink the carrot down. You're eating a mass produced like carrot chunk.

55:10.400 --> 55:12.960
I'm embarrassed to say, Adam, I thought that until very recently.

55:14.800 --> 55:19.200
They don't even look like baby carrots. They look like a piece of carpentry. They look like

55:19.200 --> 55:23.280
something you'd use to join two, two by force. I just didn't think we'd be that wasteful. I mean,

55:23.280 --> 55:27.280
that's why I just couldn't believe we would shave down a carrot. And then, but here's the thing,

55:27.280 --> 55:31.840
it makes a bad product. And so like, you turn away from it. You're like, like,

55:31.840 --> 55:36.240
melons is the other one I notice about. You got to put so much hummus on a baby carrot for it to

55:36.240 --> 55:39.920
taste like anything. It's like the saddest experience to eat a baby carrot.

55:39.920 --> 55:43.520
Yes. And so like it pushes, you're like, oh, produce isn't that good anymore, or

55:43.520 --> 55:45.920
these Driscoll berries don't taste that good. So then you start eating more,

55:45.920 --> 55:51.120
well, who isn't, you know, Oreos and stuff. And then on top of it, you go into these grocery stores

55:51.120 --> 55:55.200
and like, you're not seeing innovation. You're not seeing new products because like these stores,

55:55.200 --> 55:59.120
they don't want to deal with some local person doing what you only do two stores at Walmart.

55:59.120 --> 56:02.720
They want to deal in the bisco that can do 4,000 stores. So that's why when you go into a store

56:02.720 --> 56:08.080
now, you just see a new kind of Oreo. You don't see new products. You don't see quality stuff.

56:08.080 --> 56:13.520
And it's, on top of it, it's, it skews the system so much where, I mean, so much of that

56:13.520 --> 56:17.760
neoliberal framework of like, change the system with your fork to bifurcate the system even more.

56:17.760 --> 56:21.360
You have like, whatever that fancy LA one's called Aragon for like the rich.

56:21.360 --> 56:27.520
Arawan, yeah. Arawan. And then you have like, Walmart is massive. Walmart sells one in three

56:27.520 --> 56:31.920
groceries. Their market share grocery is the same as the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh,

56:31.920 --> 56:35.280
and eighth combined. That is an insane amount of market power.

56:35.280 --> 56:40.640
And as you say, one baron creates more barons because Walmart wants all the food. They want to

56:40.640 --> 56:45.920
buy it in huge tranches. They want to get all their food from one supplier. And so that privileges

56:45.920 --> 56:51.120
the one supplier who's able to grow the exact same thing in huge quantities to sell to every

56:51.120 --> 56:56.320
Walmart store simultaneously. And that causes them to buy each other up. Or for one, like if

56:56.400 --> 56:59.440
Walmart's selling one out of three groceries, then pretty soon you're going to have one person

56:59.440 --> 57:03.600
selling one out of three berries and then probably even more than that. You said melons,

57:03.600 --> 57:06.240
though. What's the problem with melons? I wanted to hear it.

57:06.240 --> 57:10.080
I mean, after spending all this time, I mean, feel sorry for my husband because I just vomit

57:10.080 --> 57:13.760
this information I had on all day. And so we got married two years ago.

57:13.760 --> 57:17.680
I'll replace them. I'll marry you. I love hearing this stuff. He doesn't want to hear it anymore.

57:17.680 --> 57:20.240
Okay. Propose. I'm down.

57:20.240 --> 57:24.160
Our one year anniversary, we went to like, like France and Italy. And I'm just,

57:24.160 --> 57:29.200
I got to see a food system that worked. And I hate cantaloupe. I just, I see it in the fruit

57:29.200 --> 57:32.720
bowl. I think it tastes awful. But then like, they had it over there and you're like, wait,

57:32.720 --> 57:35.760
this is actually really good. They would sell it on the side of the road. You pull over,

57:35.760 --> 57:40.720
you buy a good cantaloupe and you're like, it's just, it's kind of like when you cut corners

57:40.720 --> 57:44.640
so much, at some point you're cutting bone. Like there's no efficiencies again. You're

57:44.640 --> 57:49.040
cutting quality and it's just so rapid, especially private equity people don't,

57:49.680 --> 57:53.200
they don't understand how to run a business. I mean, the reason the best grocery stores in

57:53.200 --> 57:57.760
America are actually still privately owned, like HGB in Texas, Hive in Iowa, Wegmans on the East

57:57.760 --> 58:01.920
Coast. You know what I mean? There's not this Wall Street financialization because like,

58:01.920 --> 58:06.160
some boy who went to Harvard MBA, who's never worked a grocery store job in his life,

58:06.160 --> 58:11.440
doesn't understand the nuances of this, of these marketplaces. And it's also, it's a profession.

58:11.440 --> 58:15.760
There's a craftsmanship to merchandising. My dad used to be a beer merchandiser. So like,

58:15.760 --> 58:19.600
I noticed that when I go into like, you go into like a Wegmans or whatever, fancy growth, like,

58:19.600 --> 58:22.640
sorry, those type of grocery stores, they merchandise, they care, they're,

58:22.640 --> 58:26.000
it's homecoming weekend. It's gonna be a bunch of homecoming stuff. You go into Walmart and

58:26.000 --> 58:30.400
they just throw the pallet on the shelf and you have to dig for it. Yep. Well, what can,

58:30.400 --> 58:35.120
what can be done about this, right? You had said that maybe there's a positive sign in Lena Kahn's

58:35.120 --> 58:39.360
leadership at the FTC. We'll see how long she's there based on what's happening, what's going

58:39.360 --> 58:44.640
to happen in November. I kind of don't think Trump will keep her on if he wins. But you know,

58:44.640 --> 58:51.040
we have seen a sea change in antitrust enforcement, at least on the Democratic side.

58:51.040 --> 58:56.480
And there are occasionally some Republicans who will join in on an antitrust fight here or there.

58:56.480 --> 59:00.720
They do occasionally have an ally. And you're saying that, you know, the right, right side

59:00.720 --> 59:07.040
of the aisle is becoming more and more obsessed with food. So is there a growing appetite for

59:07.040 --> 59:12.240
change in our food system? Yeah, I mean, I think what Lena is really fascinating is,

59:12.240 --> 59:15.760
I actually think she's one of President Biden's best of local points, because

59:16.480 --> 59:21.200
what says so much was earlier this year, Matt Gaetz went to the Wall Street Journal and praised her.

59:21.200 --> 59:26.560
Wow. That is, they're such a, I'm a big fan of outflanking, like Republicans will talk this

59:26.560 --> 59:31.120
big game about me backing, be right there with them. Josh Hawley does a lot of this,

59:31.760 --> 59:36.720
outflank Republicans here, because it's such a, hold their feet to the fire. I mean,

59:36.720 --> 59:40.720
it's also kind of, I'm a big believer too that weird things happen in America when

59:40.720 --> 59:44.640
unique coalitions come together. But what gives me the big most hope and what we can do are like

59:44.640 --> 59:49.360
three things that come to my mind. One is the death of ethanol. The Biden administration has

59:49.360 --> 59:53.360
been incredibly aggressive at transitioning America out of flake to EVs and hybrids. And

59:53.360 --> 59:57.360
people don't realize, but the largest use of corn now in America is ethanol. And it's really,

59:57.360 --> 01:00:03.600
which is used for what? Burning, burning corn in your cars. Like it's truly. Wow. It is the Museum

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.480
of Failure included ethanol and it's an exhibit. I, anyone that thinks ethanol is good for the

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.680
climate thinks the world is flat in 2024. Also, I think in food, you see one of President Biden's

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.000
worst political appointments, Secretary Vilsack. Secretary Vilsack of USDA is a former industrial

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.400
dairy lobbyist. His solution to climate change right now is to put ethanol in the airplanes.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:28.480
Wow. And by the way, this is a crazy thing to do because like fossil fuels are bad enough

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:32.560
because you're taking energy out of the ground, putting it into the atmosphere, right? Stored

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:37.920
energy out of the ground into the atmosphere. That's bad. That warms the earth de facto, right?

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:43.200
But if you're taking energy from the sun and putting it into the atmosphere, right? Like the

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.600
sun is hitting the corn, making the corn grow. And then you're burning that. You're releasing,

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.040
that's a whole new source of energy to put into the atmosphere to heat the planet up.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.680
It's even worse because you have to use fossil fuels to help grow the corn.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.000
Right. Of course you do. Fertilizer and et cetera. Yeah.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.760
And the other appreciated thing is Koch brothers are actually massive in fertilizer. They have

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.320
a massive holding in nitrogen fertilizer. So like there's this whole weird marriage between

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.560
big egg and big fossil fuel oil that hasn't been fully, I don't think people realize.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.320
But it's just delusional. But you know what? It's like watching Miley Coady chase that

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.640
bird off the cliff right now. Ethanol is going to die. I don't care what the industry says.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.840
It's going to meet its maker. And my big moment, to me, it's what are we going to do at that moment?

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:26.800
I want to put animals back on land. That is like truly one of my biggest things because it's like,

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.360
it takes the temperature down. It makes, who doesn't want more farmers? Here's like,

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.040
most grain production is going to be robotics. That's not a bad thing. You go to a farm show

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:40.080
now. These tractors drive themselves. But there's only so many dairy cow one man or one person could

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:46.720
look after. But for these rural areas, it's more jobs. Yeah. So you want to go to a small scale

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:54.960
version of dairy farming again, like breaking it up. And rather than one farmer, one quote farmer

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.960
owning huge numbers of cows, you've got small scale farms again. You think that's a massive

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:04.080
improvement? I just want to go back to that family farmer model. It's also what it does too.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.200
Theory is weird where actually this industrial dairy model is actually even worse for the climate

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:14.800
because when a cow is on pasture, when she defecates, she's fertilizing her feet.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.840
When you put them indoors, first of all, you have to use fossil fuels to grow her feet.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:22.800
But when you pull her manure, when it breaks down, it creates additional methane that is not

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:28.320
produced when she defecates on land. So it creates additional fossil fuel gas. So like that bakers

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.960
field dairy production model is actually incredibly more destructive for the environment than

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.840
some dairy cow in Wisconsin. So like Bill Sack comes out of that world. So that's why

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:43.600
he has this like bullshit kind of mentality there. But do you think there is an emerging politics

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:50.480
that is more populist food politics where we can sort of go across partisan lines?

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:59.360
Because if you're looking for rural America is largely red and Republican politicians tend to

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:04.880
have pro-corporate policies. So do Democrats, but these are trends we're talking about.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.720
It does seem like this is an issue that could break some of our political logjam if you have

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.440
politicians from rural areas say, no, actually, I want to fight for the chicken farmer,

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:21.280
the hog farmer, the small scale pork farmer like these and actually help their folks.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:25.120
Oh, totally. I mean, keep in mind, I also want to broaden the conversation because it's not just

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.640
about the farmer. It's about those who pick it, process it, transport it, cook it, serve it.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:34.160
Of course. People like my mom and dad, that's one in 10 of Americans. And we're obsessed with such

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.560
a small part of the pie. And once you talk about one in 10, you center that on labor,

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.240
that's what really matters. And the dirty secret of big ag is it hollowed out its voter base.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.080
You used to have thousands of Iowa hog farms and now you just have a few of our

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.840
barons and no one's called bluff on it. Denver has no clothes now and no one's called it.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.600
And that's also my big thing now is I think we should junk the farm bill.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.320
The farm bill picks favorites. It heavily subsidizes grains. It's destructive for the climate.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:07.920
It rewards its incentive, this destructive model. On top of it, you have the whole heritage

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.600
heritage, Kato Institute. They hate that model too. They hate the farm bill.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.000
And I think that's a, to me, there's no reason why Democrats should support the modern-day farm

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.320
bill. The best example of how rotten the farm bill has gotten is actually crop insurance.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.920
Because when people hear crop insurance, they think it's for a hurricane or rain or whatever.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:31.920
It's not. It's insurance for low prices where 60% of the premium is paid for by the taxpayer.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.200
And there's no cap at them. So people don't realize Bill Gates has won the largest owner

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.440
of farmland in America. If you want to talk about another baron. So he can get as much crop

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:47.440
insurance as he wants, as much corn as he wants. And so, you know what I mean? It's so,

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.880
I just, I've been telling reformers, don't play, like, the system is so broken. Why

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:59.040
back that? Like let's move away from the system. At the same time, use school meals as like the

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:04.560
positive structural change vehicle. Who doesn't want all dairy-served Wisconsin come from, you

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.400
know, pasture family dairy farms instead of like industrial beef in the Brazilian rainforest.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.320
Like it's good politics. It's good tasting. You keep your money local and you're building up a new

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.560
system as you phase out an old one. Because I mean, school food's a joke. We all know that.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:22.320
Yeah. But the problem is the farm bill is one of those bills that, you know, no matter how divided

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:28.800
Congress is, it flies through every time because it has so many parts of the society are dependent

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.800
on it, right? Like it's got something for everybody or it's got something for the voters

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.960
in or the constituents or the money constituents in every area, you know. It gives

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:43.920
subsidies to the cities to purchase food, gives subsidies to the, you know, to the barons in the

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:50.000
red areas to grow the food. Is there really a chance that it could be, you know, junked, as you say?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.320
I mean, it's actually kind of falling apart. I mean, they couldn't pass. They tried to do

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:58.320
basically a copy-paste bill and they had to punt it. So like the rumor on the street is going to try.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.520
Okay. No, no.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:02.080
Then I'm not up on what's happened. That's amazing.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:06.080
No, but it's part, but it's this weird thing where, so even Republicans find crop insurance

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.680
too gluttonous. Like they want more crop insurance. You're right though. I mean,

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:15.360
there's this weird coalition of like, it's food stamps in the farm entitlement programs.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:19.520
I'll be frank. I think you can break those apart. Food stamps are going to be okay because

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.800
Walmart depends on food stamps. Walmart is the richest family in America. Some days it's the

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:29.440
richest family in the world. So much of their employee and customer base depends on food stamps.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:34.240
It's a waste subsidy. So much of corporate America needs that. I'm feeling comfortable.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.400
No one's going to touch that. I mean, first of all, you just need all Democrats and 10 Republicans

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:44.640
to save that. You take away the crop insurance. You do Farm Bill standalone. Half Republicans

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:49.200
will flake on that. And if Democrats don't support it, these, these, my hog baron, you know what I

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.800
mean? Like they don't have a constituency. Yeah. They're massive amount of welfare they get. It's

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.760
just also that coalition was formed in 1960s America. The suburbs were not a part of that

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.680
coalition. Right. Like rural America's, there's something. The suburbs. I left the suburbs out

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.800
of the story. And I mean, this election will come down to a few suburbs in the Midwest states.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:13.360
Yeah. What can the public do about this if there isn't sense about this as I am to take us out?

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.080
The big thing is I always tell people, buy what you can, buy your values, whatever. But the other

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:22.240
thing too is help connect your farmers doing it right with your schools, with your colleges.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.320
Those procurement contracts really stabilize them. Like a lot of farmers will tell you privately,

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:30.000
they don't like doing the farmers market. They get rained out, whatever. It's not consistent.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.760
You get that contract with the UC school system, your local school. It's just such a good

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.080
stabilizer. And you want to build up the people doing it right. Because writing this book over

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.920
five years is, yes, I focus on a few bad people, but most people are good. They're trying to do

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.480
the right thing. They're just struggling. And so how do you rep? How do you copy and paste them

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.280
and help them, you know, not decay, but like actually grow and, and because it's also,

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.160
there's no positive vision here. That's why I realized writing this book. No, no,

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.040
neither party is articulating that positive vision, especially for rural America.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.320
And I actually think people crave a positiveness. Like they want the opposite of what they have

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.560
right now. And the positiveness is inspiring. You're like, okay, it gives people that power

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.200
to rush the gates to get to that better system. Like that's what gives me hope, I should say.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:13.840
Yeah. And it sort of seems like all we need is a politician to, or a leader to really run on that

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:20.080
stuff, you know, and to say, you know, to find the way that this affects everybody and to speak

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.920
to people who haven't been spoken to. It literally is a pinata saying, hit me, hit me. I mean, look,

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.720
the meat packing, especially breaking up the meat companies, like these aren't,

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.360
these are comically corrupt companies. By the way, they're not even American.

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:32.000
They're like these weird state-backed monopolies. Yeah.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.200
Smithfield's quasi, there's this weird Chinese relationship there.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:41.600
A lot of the beef companies are Brazilian. So it's like, there's good politics there. It's just

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.120
something that you're waiting for the right person, vocal courage to take a swing of that

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:49.520
pinata. On God willing, somebody will. And I can't thank you enough for coming on here to make

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.600
the case that somebody should. You've certainly convinced me. The name of the book is Barons.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:58.080

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.200
