0	3520	Have you noticed that lately Google sucks ass?
3520	7440	It was supposed to be the greatest information retrieval tool in history.
7440	9920	But now, even when you search for something basic,
9920	13520	the results are full of AI garbage, fake product reviews,
13520	17760	and so many ads you might as well send your search query straight to the spam bots.
17760	22000	It's gotten so bad that now I literally add a Reddit to my search terms
22000	26080	because at least that way the garbage I get back was written by actual human dorks.
26720	28880	Well, you're not making it up.
28880	33520	A recent study found that higher ranked pages aren't on average more search engine optimized,
33520	38080	more monetized with affiliate marketing and show signs of lower text quality.
38080	43280	That means the higher a page is ranked on Google, the worse it literally is.
43280	44080	But you know what?
44080	46640	According to the study, it's not just Google.
46640	48160	It's every search engine,
48160	53280	which means the internet itself is actually getting worse right before our eyes.
53280	56000	So what the hell happened?
56000	59920	How did the internet turn from the modern library of Alexandria
59920	63120	into a free little library full of dog dookie?
63120	66640	Well, the answer is that it's all Google's fault.
66640	70800	In this video, I'm going to tell the story of how a scrappy little search engine that pledged
70800	75920	not to be evil became a ruthless monopoly that not only ruined their own core product,
75920	79360	but turned the entire internet into an endless river of shit.
80000	83360	But first, I'd like to thank DeleteMe for sponsoring this video.
83360	87840	And second, I know one corner of the internet that isn't shit, our Patreon community.
87840	92720	Head to Patreon.com slash Adam Conover, and you can support this show and join a community
92720	96880	of smart, curious people who love to talk about how screwed up the world is.
96880	101040	Plus, you get every monologue and podcast episode I put out ad free.
101040	103680	Head to Patreon.com slash Adam Conover to join us.
103680	104880	We'd love to have you.
104880	108160	And as always, if you want to come see me do stand up comedy on the road,
108160	111280	head to AdamConover.net for tickets and tour dates.
111280	115200	You know, I'm old enough to remember the magical early years of the internet.
115200	118880	You'd wait for your mom to hang up on Aunt Barbara, fire up your compact
118880	124320	Presario's 2400 Bod modem, and boom, you'd be on the worldwide web.
124320	128560	An entire new digital universe full of people from all over the globe,
128560	130240	publishing fascinating things.
130800	135040	Just one problem, there was no way to find any of it because search engines back then
135040	137040	did not work at all.
137040	141760	Altavista, Lycos, that fancy pants butler with the shitting smirk on his face.
142320	145360	The results they'd give you were useless and random.
145360	149520	You'd type Stone Cold Steve Austin and it'd give you the weather report for Texas.
149520	155120	One time I searched how to tie a tie on Lycos and the little dog took a dump on my desktop.
155120	157600	I'm not kidding. That really happened to me.
157600	163440	But then in 1998, two engineers named Sergei Brin and Larry Page came up with an amazing
163440	167040	new invention, a search engine that actually worked.
167040	169040	It was called Back Rub.
169680	172560	And then when they realized that sounded a little bit too much like low-grade sexual
172560	174800	harassment, they changed the name to Google.
174800	179840	Google used the fundamental structure of the web itself, the links between pages,
179840	183760	to figure out with e-reaccuracy which pages were the most relevant.
183760	190400	And I really cannot overemphasize what a big deal it was in 1998 to get real information this quickly.
190480	194560	It was the second best form of Instagramification a teenage boy could get his hands on.
194560	196400	And it helped you find the first a lot more quickly.
199280	202800	Even better, Google pledged that they were a new kind of tech company,
202800	206320	one that actually wanted to make the internet a better place.
206320	210640	In fact, their company motto was literally don't be evil.
210640	214880	Oh look, they even put it on the wall so employees could walk up and stare at it.
214880	219040	Well, someone should warn Mr. Shorts and Sandals at work there because in the years since,
219280	220800	it's gotten pretty evil.
220800	224160	Over the past two decades, Google results have gone from this,
224160	228880	simple, streamlined, as clean and clear as the acne face wash I was using back then,
228880	234000	to an oily, disgusting mess covered with ads, shopping referral links,
234000	238160	and YouTube videos that, surprise, surprise, also play ads.
238160	242800	Google's interface is now so crammed with advertising that a Washington Post report
242800	247920	found you now have to scroll six times further down the page to get to the first real unpaid
247920	249520	link to an outside website.
249520	253760	It's like if in order to cross a bridge, you first had to drive your car into sh** river.
253760	257360	So why would Google purposefully make their revolutionary
257360	260480	industry defining search engine worse and harder to use?
261200	261920	Simple.
261920	265680	It's because at the end of the day, Google isn't a search company at all.
265680	269920	It's also not an email company, a video company, or a smartphone company.
269920	272240	It's an advertising company.
272240	276720	See, Google could have come up with a business model that put our needs first.
276720	279600	They could have allowed us to pay them for a better class of service,
279600	282960	or sold autograph prints of the Google Doodle or whatever.
282960	288800	But no, they chose a different path, one in which you are not the customer at all.
288800	291040	Instead, you are the product.
291040	298080	Because Google's real revenue source is selling you and all the data they have on you to advertisers.
298080	302240	Google themselves say that we earn most of our money by showing ads.
302880	305440	Huh, I think most might be a little bit of an understatement.
305440	307040	Let's check the actual number.
307040	308240	Oh, okay.
308240	313760	In 2023, advertisers paid Google $237 billion.
313760	317120	Is your broke a**pan Google $237 billion a year?
317120	318400	Mine sure isn't.
318400	324640	That means that Google's real job is keeping Pfizer and Johnny Spamalot happy, not you.
324640	328240	And that objectively makes Google worse.
328240	330400	According to two researchers at Stanford,
330400	335280	advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.
335360	339920	And we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased
339920	343280	towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.
343280	344800	You know who wrote those words?
344800	349520	It was Sergei Brin and Larry Page, the founders of Google.
349520	354880	They wrote those words in 1998 in the famous paper that introduced Google.
354880	358880	These motherf**kers knew the entire time that selling ads was the original
358880	361280	sin of search engines and would ruin their product.
361280	362320	But you know what they did?
362320	369040	They backed up the money truck anyway and buried their principles in a giant pile of cash.
369040	374400	In the years since, Google has steadily worked to make their search engine better for advertisers
374400	376080	and worse for you.
376080	380320	They made it harder to tell the difference between an ad and a real link.
380320	385440	They cut thousands of search quality raters whose job it was to make sure Google's results
385440	388800	are high quality and they demoted their head of search.
388800	392880	An original engineer who helped build the search engine and spent decades
392880	398400	making sure it was fast and effective and replaced him with the head of the advertising department.
398400	403120	That's right, the most important widely used information retrieval tool on earth
403120	406480	is now being run by the guy from the f**king spam department.
406480	411120	The fact that as citizens, the main tool we use to get information about the world,
411120	416080	our political system, about our own health, is an algorithm run by the world's largest
416080	419440	advertising company is supremely f**ked up.
419440	423120	It's like getting nutrition tips from Ronald f**king McDonald.
423120	424240	Google tracks you.
424240	428080	They monitor what you do on the internet and then they sell all the data they have on you
428080	429120	to advertisers.
429120	435040	And the worst part is they then use all that money to make sure you have no other choice.
435600	438800	Now, before we get into that, if you want to keep your personal information
438800	442000	off of search engines, you absolutely need to check out delete me.
442720	443440	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
443440	444880	I didn't say delete me.
444880	446720	I'm talking about delete me.
446720	451280	If you've watched this channel before, you know how important information privacy is.
451280	454320	Big tech companies aren't the only ones hoovering up your data.
454320	458960	There are bad actors out there called data brokers who make a living buying and selling
458960	459920	your information.
459920	465680	Delete me's teams of experts scour the web to find and remove your personal information for you
465680	470000	to keep your info out of the clutches of data brokers and keep you safe.
470000	470560	And you know what?
470560	473600	Because I also want to keep my family safe from data brokers.
473600	477440	I am thrilled that delete me now offers family account management.
477440	481200	You can seamlessly add your family members and loved ones to your account,
481200	484400	creating a unified hub for family privacy protection,
484400	487120	complete with unique data sheets per family member.
487120	490800	That means you can keep your family members safe no matter what their age is,
490800	493440	whether you're looking to protect your parents or your children,
493440	497040	or maybe parents who behave like children when they get calls from a scammer.
497040	498080	And best of all,
498080	503520	now you can get 20% off your delete me plan when you go to join delete me dot com slash
503520	506400	Adam and use the promo code Adam at checkout.
506400	510800	That's joined delete me dot com slash Adam and use promo code Adam.
510800	512000	Okay, take me back now.
512640	517280	You know, it wouldn't be that big a deal for Google to suck as hard as it does if there
517280	518640	were another option.
518640	523760	But here's the worst part, Google uses the massive resources they get from selling you
523760	527760	to advertisers to make sure that you have nowhere else to go.
527840	528480	Sure.
528480	533040	At first, Google won the search market fair and square by having the best product.
533040	535120	Altavista went Asta Lavista.
535120	539520	The light ghost dog was sent to a nice farm family upstate and asked Jeeves.
539520	543520	Well, he's not even the logo anymore because he killed himself.
544480	549200	But once they achieved dominance, Google started using their advertising billions
549200	554240	to buy their way to a monopoly so that no one could do to them what they did to poor Jeeves.
554800	560880	Google pays Mozilla upwards of $450 million a year to be the primary search engine in
560880	562240	the Firefox browser.
562240	568160	And they pay Apple as much as $15 billion a year to be the default search engine in Safari.
568160	572560	That's right, the fruit company is getting more than the entire GDP of Laos just to stop
572560	574160	you from binging shit.
574160	578080	Of course, Google doesn't have to pay anyone to be the default for the most popular phone
578080	579200	and web browser.
579200	582880	That's because their monopolistic asses already own them.
582880	587520	It can take 15 clicks to change your default search engine on a Google browser.
587520	589440	So most people never bother.
590000	596000	These defaults are so powerful in shaping user behavior that Google now owns 90 percent
596000	597120	of the search market.
597120	602400	And it is almost impossible for new search engines to break in, even if they're actually
602400	602960	better.
602960	609120	In 2018, two former Google employees left the company to build a new, better search engine.
609120	610080	And you know what?
610080	611040	They actually did it.
611600	614560	Their site, Neva, had no ads.
614560	619520	Instead, it focused on getting you actual results as quickly as possible.
619520	624000	And almost everyone who tried it thought it was better than Google in every way.
624560	629120	But when you're fighting against a monopolist, being the best isn't good enough.
629120	634880	Neva found that Google's default position in almost every browser was so entrenched and
634880	640720	powerful, it was impossible to get people to switch to or even try their search engine.
640720	644400	And since they didn't have 15 billion dollars to pay off Tim Cook,
644960	650160	after a few years, they shut down just another corpse buried in Google's basement.
650880	652240	So why does Google suck now?
652800	655920	Well, why would they bother to make their search engine work better
655920	659760	when they can just buy their way to being the only search engine?
659760	661360	But hey, I know what you're thinking.
661360	663840	There's a couple other teeny tiny search engines out there.
663840	664400	There's Bing.
664400	665760	There's DuckDuckGo.
665760	667360	And hey, you're a tech savvy millennial.
667360	671840	You'll just change your default search engine and go back to petting doggos laughing emoji.
672480	673920	But here's the real problem.
673920	679040	No matter what search engine you use, your search results are still going to suck.
679040	686400	Because Google is now so dominant, so powerful that their choices shape the very internet itself.
687360	690720	See, if you're not in the top Google results for a certain search term,
690720	693200	your website is basically invisible.
693280	698000	So a powerful industry of search engine optimization, or SEO,
698000	702320	has sprung up to help publishers sleaze their way to the top of the results.
703040	706800	SEO is the process of gaming Google search algorithm,
706800	711040	giving it exactly what it wants so that it always displays your page first,
711040	713520	regardless of whether or not it's actually the best.
714080	718000	Google actually encourages publishers to use SEO techniques.
718000	723120	The problem, though, is that using these techniques generally makes your website suck ass.
723760	728880	So there's this website called HouseFresh where experts rigorously test air purifiers
728880	730320	and then publish the results.
730320	732160	That's literally all they do.
732160	735120	They're an example of what the internet was supposed to be.
735120	740880	An independent site run by real experts writing reliable articles that are actually useful.
740880	744000	And Google is slowly murdering them.
744000	747760	In a blog post earlier this year, HouseFresh revealed how they were being
747760	751920	massacred in the Google rankings by SEO optimized content farms
751920	756000	that just pretend to review air purifiers to game the algorithm.
756000	759920	The purifiers these sites recommend suck so hard,
759920	761200	actually they don't suck hard.
761200	763760	They suck poorly, that's the point of an air purifier,
763760	766960	that it is obvious that no one involved with these sites
766960	769680	has even seen them in person, much less tested them.
769680	772160	But that doesn't matter because all Google cares about
772160	778000	is that these sites use the keywords rigorous testing and lab team and expert on their pages.
778000	781840	Why spend the money to actually do those things or even buy an air purifier
781840	785760	when you can just tell Google's idiot algorithm the magic fucking words?
785760	789760	Let's be clear, Google's only actual job as a search engine
789760	794560	is to send me to good sites like HouseFresh rather than bullshit spam sites.
794560	798800	But no, Google says here's a piece of shit site that lists some piece of shit products
798800	800080	and it's number one.
800080	801280	Aren't you feeling lucky?
801840	804960	Optimizing your site for Google's algorithm doesn't make it better,
804960	809360	it makes it worse, less readable, less useful, and less honest.
809920	813840	But a site's Google rank has become so existentially important
813840	819760	that now at least 80% of all websites use SEO in some form, 80%.
820560	822880	That's why every time you look up a recipe now,
822880	825680	it starts with when I started best cooking blog,
825680	828080	I never thought it would really be best cooking blog.
828160	830000	But now people come up to me and say,
830000	833520	wow, you really do have the best cooking blog for best recipes,
833520	835600	tasty recipes, go-to recipes,
835600	838960	and also the best tasty go-to recipes for hungry daughters.
838960	842160	Anyway, I'm going to be sharing my best tasty go-to recipe
842160	844320	for how to hard boil an egg.
844320	845680	First, buy an egg.
845680	848720	When online shopping for best deals on tasty eggs, I...
852800	854960	This fucking sucks.
855520	857760	It doesn't matter what search engine you use
857760	860800	because the entire internet is now just an endless stream
860800	864080	of generic, content-free SEO barf.
864080	866960	And it's all Google's goddamn fault.
866960	870480	They threw up in the pool and we're all swimming in it.
870480	873040	I mean, the internet was supposed to be
873040	876800	the greatest source of information in the history of humankind.
876800	880400	But Google's monopoly has created a world in which real sites
880400	882720	that employ real journalists, real reviewers,
882720	885440	and real experts shut down every day
885440	888640	because they can't compete with the bullshit content farms
888640	891120	that Google's algorithm promotes instead.
891120	894240	And now, that so-called artificial intelligence
894240	897600	is about to flood the internet with even more dumbass spam?
897600	898880	What is Google doing?
898880	902560	They're jamming AI into the fucking search engine itself.
902560	904800	So now, instead of just serving you the barf,
904800	907280	Google's AI is going to ingest the barf for you,
907280	910560	then barf it back at you in hopes that you'll swallow it down
910560	912480	like some kind of vomit oroborus.
913040	915120	I mean, what the fuck happened to Don't Be Evil?
915120	917440	Did they just take that sign off the wall?
917440	918960	Oh, yeah, they did.
918960	920480	And then they shot that dude in the head.
921200	924720	Google built its fortune on the forest of links,
924720	928080	the deep structure of an internet created by humans.
928640	932080	But after they won, they used their money and power
932080	935040	to destroy that forest and make sure nothing else
935040	936960	could ever grow in its place.
936960	939600	And nothing is more evil than that.
940720	943280	Now, I know that all sounds pretty bleak,
943280	945280	but there is a way to fix it.
945840	948560	And in fact, the phrase Don't Be Evil
948560	951520	is itself a reference to the last tech monopoly
951520	954640	that we needed to cut down to size, Microsoft.
955200	958400	See, back in the 90s, Microsoft was a ruthless giant
958400	960720	that sought to dominate the computer industry
960720	962560	and the internet itself.
962560	964080	Everyone hated them.
964080	966800	They were using their monopoly over the operating system,
966800	970080	Windows, to gain an unfair advantage over the internet,
970080	972800	bundling their crappy web browser internet explorer
972800	974960	as the default so that competitors
974960	976400	couldn't break into the market.
976400	978640	And the fear was that if Microsoft was allowed
978640	981280	to establish monopoly control over the software
981280	982880	we used to connect to the web,
982880	984560	they'd be able to kill competition
984560	986560	across the entire internet.
986560	989040	Microsoft even had internal conversations
989040	990800	in which they discussed directing users
990800	994240	to Microsoft search sites if they typed in Google.com.
995040	997120	Well, you know what happened next?
997120	999360	The federal government sued them
999360	1001440	for violating antitrust law.
1001440	1003920	And even though that case was eventually settled,
1003920	1006480	just the threat of federal enforcement
1006480	1010000	actually caused Microsoft to change their business practices.
1010000	1011840	Microsoft's own lawyers admitted
1011840	1014240	that the constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper
1014240	1017040	all the time actually made them behave differently
1017040	1020080	because no one wanted to test the regulators anymore.
1020080	1022880	Microsoft stopped trying to monopolize the internet,
1022880	1024640	giving new startups like Google
1024640	1026880	the space they needed to grow and flourish.
1027440	1028560	That's right.
1028560	1031280	Google, the biggest of all big tech companies
1031280	1034160	only exists because the government was willing to step in
1034160	1036560	and kick some big tech ass.
1036560	1039680	This is why we need antitrust enforcement.
1039680	1041360	If monopolistic companies
1041360	1043920	are allowed to strangle their competitors in the crib
1043920	1046880	like Microsoft used to do and like Google does today,
1046880	1048560	they'll never be able to grow up
1048560	1051120	into those energetic idealistic teenagers
1051120	1052080	that change the world.
1052800	1053760	So you know what?
1053760	1055040	If we want to fix this,
1055040	1057440	our government needs to get off of its ass
1057440	1059440	enforce our antitrust laws
1059440	1061760	and start punishing the assholes who...
1062640	1063840	Oh, never mind.
1063840	1065360	I'm seeing that the Department of Justice
1065360	1067120	actually sued Google months ago.
1068080	1069200	Sorry, force of habit.
1069200	1071920	I'm just not used to the government like doing its job ever.
1072880	1074000	Hope they win.
1074000	1075280	And you should too.
1075280	1075920	Because you know what?
1075920	1077440	There's tech pundits out there
1077440	1080080	who will try to tell you that this is government overreach,
1080080	1083040	that the government shouldn't meddle in big tech.
1083040	1086800	And that's a lie that we all need to start pushing back on.
1086800	1088000	Because if we don't,
1088000	1091360	well, we better all start learning to boil an egg in barf.
