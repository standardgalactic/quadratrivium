00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
Have you noticed that lately Google sucks ass?

00:03.520 --> 00:07.440
It was supposed to be the greatest information retrieval tool in history.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.920
But now, even when you search for something basic,

00:09.920 --> 00:13.520
the results are full of AI garbage, fake product reviews,

00:13.520 --> 00:17.760
and so many ads you might as well send your search query straight to the spam bots.

00:17.760 --> 00:22.000
It's gotten so bad that now I literally add a Reddit to my search terms

00:22.000 --> 00:26.080
because at least that way the garbage I get back was written by actual human dorks.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.880
Well, you're not making it up.

00:28.880 --> 00:33.520
A recent study found that higher ranked pages aren't on average more search engine optimized,

00:33.520 --> 00:38.080
more monetized with affiliate marketing and show signs of lower text quality.

00:38.080 --> 00:43.280
That means the higher a page is ranked on Google, the worse it literally is.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.080
But you know what?

00:44.080 --> 00:46.640
According to the study, it's not just Google.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.160
It's every search engine,

00:48.160 --> 00:53.280
which means the internet itself is actually getting worse right before our eyes.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.000
So what the hell happened?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.920
How did the internet turn from the modern library of Alexandria

00:59.920 --> 01:03.120
into a free little library full of dog dookie?

01:03.120 --> 01:06.640
Well, the answer is that it's all Google's fault.

01:06.640 --> 01:10.800
In this video, I'm going to tell the story of how a scrappy little search engine that pledged

01:10.800 --> 01:15.920
not to be evil became a ruthless monopoly that not only ruined their own core product,

01:15.920 --> 01:19.360
but turned the entire internet into an endless river of shit.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.360
But first, I'd like to thank DeleteMe for sponsoring this video.

01:23.360 --> 01:27.840
And second, I know one corner of the internet that isn't shit, our Patreon community.

01:27.840 --> 01:32.720
Head to Patreon.com slash Adam Conover, and you can support this show and join a community

01:32.720 --> 01:36.880
of smart, curious people who love to talk about how screwed up the world is.

01:36.880 --> 01:41.040
Plus, you get every monologue and podcast episode I put out ad free.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.680
Head to Patreon.com slash Adam Conover to join us.

01:43.680 --> 01:44.880
We'd love to have you.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.160
And as always, if you want to come see me do stand up comedy on the road,

01:48.160 --> 01:51.280
head to AdamConover.net for tickets and tour dates.

01:51.280 --> 01:55.200
You know, I'm old enough to remember the magical early years of the internet.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.880
You'd wait for your mom to hang up on Aunt Barbara, fire up your compact

01:58.880 --> 02:04.320
Presario's 2400 Bod modem, and boom, you'd be on the worldwide web.

02:04.320 --> 02:08.560
An entire new digital universe full of people from all over the globe,

02:08.560 --> 02:10.240
publishing fascinating things.

02:10.800 --> 02:15.040
Just one problem, there was no way to find any of it because search engines back then

02:15.040 --> 02:17.040
did not work at all.

02:17.040 --> 02:21.760
Altavista, Lycos, that fancy pants butler with the shitting smirk on his face.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.360
The results they'd give you were useless and random.

02:25.360 --> 02:29.520
You'd type Stone Cold Steve Austin and it'd give you the weather report for Texas.

02:29.520 --> 02:35.120
One time I searched how to tie a tie on Lycos and the little dog took a dump on my desktop.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.600
I'm not kidding. That really happened to me.

02:37.600 --> 02:43.440
But then in 1998, two engineers named Sergei Brin and Larry Page came up with an amazing

02:43.440 --> 02:47.040
new invention, a search engine that actually worked.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.040
It was called Back Rub.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.560
And then when they realized that sounded a little bit too much like low-grade sexual

02:52.560 --> 02:54.800
harassment, they changed the name to Google.

02:54.800 --> 02:59.840
Google used the fundamental structure of the web itself, the links between pages,

02:59.840 --> 03:03.760
to figure out with e-reaccuracy which pages were the most relevant.

03:03.760 --> 03:10.400
And I really cannot overemphasize what a big deal it was in 1998 to get real information this quickly.

03:10.480 --> 03:14.560
It was the second best form of Instagramification a teenage boy could get his hands on.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.400
And it helped you find the first a lot more quickly.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.800
Even better, Google pledged that they were a new kind of tech company,

03:22.800 --> 03:26.320
one that actually wanted to make the internet a better place.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.640
In fact, their company motto was literally don't be evil.

03:30.640 --> 03:34.880
Oh look, they even put it on the wall so employees could walk up and stare at it.

03:34.880 --> 03:39.040
Well, someone should warn Mr. Shorts and Sandals at work there because in the years since,

03:39.280 --> 03:40.800
it's gotten pretty evil.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.160
Over the past two decades, Google results have gone from this,

03:44.160 --> 03:48.880
simple, streamlined, as clean and clear as the acne face wash I was using back then,

03:48.880 --> 03:54.000
to an oily, disgusting mess covered with ads, shopping referral links,

03:54.000 --> 03:58.160
and YouTube videos that, surprise, surprise, also play ads.

03:58.160 --> 04:02.800
Google's interface is now so crammed with advertising that a Washington Post report

04:02.800 --> 04:07.920
found you now have to scroll six times further down the page to get to the first real unpaid

04:07.920 --> 04:09.520
link to an outside website.

04:09.520 --> 04:13.760
It's like if in order to cross a bridge, you first had to drive your car into sh** river.

04:13.760 --> 04:17.360
So why would Google purposefully make their revolutionary

04:17.360 --> 04:20.480
industry defining search engine worse and harder to use?

04:21.200 --> 04:21.920
Simple.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.680
It's because at the end of the day, Google isn't a search company at all.

04:25.680 --> 04:29.920
It's also not an email company, a video company, or a smartphone company.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.240
It's an advertising company.

04:32.240 --> 04:36.720
See, Google could have come up with a business model that put our needs first.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.600
They could have allowed us to pay them for a better class of service,

04:39.600 --> 04:42.960
or sold autograph prints of the Google Doodle or whatever.

04:42.960 --> 04:48.800
But no, they chose a different path, one in which you are not the customer at all.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.040
Instead, you are the product.

04:51.040 --> 04:58.080
Because Google's real revenue source is selling you and all the data they have on you to advertisers.

04:58.080 --> 05:02.240
Google themselves say that we earn most of our money by showing ads.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.440
Huh, I think most might be a little bit of an understatement.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.040
Let's check the actual number.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.240
Oh, okay.

05:08.240 --> 05:13.760
In 2023, advertisers paid Google $237 billion.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.120
Is your broke a**pan Google $237 billion a year?

05:17.120 --> 05:18.400
Mine sure isn't.

05:18.400 --> 05:24.640
That means that Google's real job is keeping Pfizer and Johnny Spamalot happy, not you.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.240
And that objectively makes Google worse.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.400
According to two researchers at Stanford,

05:30.400 --> 05:35.280
advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.

05:35.360 --> 05:39.920
And we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased

05:39.920 --> 05:43.280
towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.800
You know who wrote those words?

05:44.800 --> 05:49.520
It was Sergei Brin and Larry Page, the founders of Google.

05:49.520 --> 05:54.880
They wrote those words in 1998 in the famous paper that introduced Google.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.880
These motherf**kers knew the entire time that selling ads was the original

05:58.880 --> 06:01.280
sin of search engines and would ruin their product.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.320
But you know what they did?

06:02.320 --> 06:09.040
They backed up the money truck anyway and buried their principles in a giant pile of cash.

06:09.040 --> 06:14.400
In the years since, Google has steadily worked to make their search engine better for advertisers

06:14.400 --> 06:16.080
and worse for you.

06:16.080 --> 06:20.320
They made it harder to tell the difference between an ad and a real link.

06:20.320 --> 06:25.440
They cut thousands of search quality raters whose job it was to make sure Google's results

06:25.440 --> 06:28.800
are high quality and they demoted their head of search.

06:28.800 --> 06:32.880
An original engineer who helped build the search engine and spent decades

06:32.880 --> 06:38.400
making sure it was fast and effective and replaced him with the head of the advertising department.

06:38.400 --> 06:43.120
That's right, the most important widely used information retrieval tool on earth

06:43.120 --> 06:46.480
is now being run by the guy from the f**king spam department.

06:46.480 --> 06:51.120
The fact that as citizens, the main tool we use to get information about the world,

06:51.120 --> 06:56.080
our political system, about our own health, is an algorithm run by the world's largest

06:56.080 --> 06:59.440
advertising company is supremely f**ked up.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.120
It's like getting nutrition tips from Ronald f**king McDonald.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.240
Google tracks you.

07:04.240 --> 07:08.080
They monitor what you do on the internet and then they sell all the data they have on you

07:08.080 --> 07:09.120
to advertisers.

07:09.120 --> 07:15.040
And the worst part is they then use all that money to make sure you have no other choice.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.800
Now, before we get into that, if you want to keep your personal information

07:18.800 --> 07:22.000
off of search engines, you absolutely need to check out delete me.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.880
I didn't say delete me.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.720
I'm talking about delete me.

07:26.720 --> 07:31.280
If you've watched this channel before, you know how important information privacy is.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.320
Big tech companies aren't the only ones hoovering up your data.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.960
There are bad actors out there called data brokers who make a living buying and selling

07:38.960 --> 07:39.920
your information.

07:39.920 --> 07:45.680
Delete me's teams of experts scour the web to find and remove your personal information for you

07:45.680 --> 07:50.000
to keep your info out of the clutches of data brokers and keep you safe.

07:50.000 --> 07:50.560
And you know what?

07:50.560 --> 07:53.600
Because I also want to keep my family safe from data brokers.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.440
I am thrilled that delete me now offers family account management.

07:57.440 --> 08:01.200
You can seamlessly add your family members and loved ones to your account,

08:01.200 --> 08:04.400
creating a unified hub for family privacy protection,

08:04.400 --> 08:07.120
complete with unique data sheets per family member.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.800
That means you can keep your family members safe no matter what their age is,

08:10.800 --> 08:13.440
whether you're looking to protect your parents or your children,

08:13.440 --> 08:17.040
or maybe parents who behave like children when they get calls from a scammer.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.080
And best of all,

08:18.080 --> 08:23.520
now you can get 20% off your delete me plan when you go to join delete me dot com slash

08:23.520 --> 08:26.400
Adam and use the promo code Adam at checkout.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.800
That's joined delete me dot com slash Adam and use promo code Adam.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.000
Okay, take me back now.

08:32.640 --> 08:37.280
You know, it wouldn't be that big a deal for Google to suck as hard as it does if there

08:37.280 --> 08:38.640
were another option.

08:38.640 --> 08:43.760
But here's the worst part, Google uses the massive resources they get from selling you

08:43.760 --> 08:47.760
to advertisers to make sure that you have nowhere else to go.

08:47.840 --> 08:48.480
Sure.

08:48.480 --> 08:53.040
At first, Google won the search market fair and square by having the best product.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.120
Altavista went Asta Lavista.

08:55.120 --> 08:59.520
The light ghost dog was sent to a nice farm family upstate and asked Jeeves.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.520
Well, he's not even the logo anymore because he killed himself.

09:04.480 --> 09:09.200
But once they achieved dominance, Google started using their advertising billions

09:09.200 --> 09:14.240
to buy their way to a monopoly so that no one could do to them what they did to poor Jeeves.

09:14.800 --> 09:20.880
Google pays Mozilla upwards of $450 million a year to be the primary search engine in

09:20.880 --> 09:22.240
the Firefox browser.

09:22.240 --> 09:28.160
And they pay Apple as much as $15 billion a year to be the default search engine in Safari.

09:28.160 --> 09:32.560
That's right, the fruit company is getting more than the entire GDP of Laos just to stop

09:32.560 --> 09:34.160
you from binging shit.

09:34.160 --> 09:38.080
Of course, Google doesn't have to pay anyone to be the default for the most popular phone

09:38.080 --> 09:39.200
and web browser.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.880
That's because their monopolistic asses already own them.

09:42.880 --> 09:47.520
It can take 15 clicks to change your default search engine on a Google browser.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.440
So most people never bother.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
These defaults are so powerful in shaping user behavior that Google now owns 90 percent

09:56.000 --> 09:57.120
of the search market.

09:57.120 --> 10:02.400
And it is almost impossible for new search engines to break in, even if they're actually

10:02.400 --> 10:02.960
better.

10:02.960 --> 10:09.120
In 2018, two former Google employees left the company to build a new, better search engine.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.080
And you know what?

10:10.080 --> 10:11.040
They actually did it.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.560
Their site, Neva, had no ads.

10:14.560 --> 10:19.520
Instead, it focused on getting you actual results as quickly as possible.

10:19.520 --> 10:24.000
And almost everyone who tried it thought it was better than Google in every way.

10:24.560 --> 10:29.120
But when you're fighting against a monopolist, being the best isn't good enough.

10:29.120 --> 10:34.880
Neva found that Google's default position in almost every browser was so entrenched and

10:34.880 --> 10:40.720
powerful, it was impossible to get people to switch to or even try their search engine.

10:40.720 --> 10:44.400
And since they didn't have 15 billion dollars to pay off Tim Cook,

10:44.960 --> 10:50.160
after a few years, they shut down just another corpse buried in Google's basement.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.240
So why does Google suck now?

10:52.800 --> 10:55.920
Well, why would they bother to make their search engine work better

10:55.920 --> 10:59.760
when they can just buy their way to being the only search engine?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.360
But hey, I know what you're thinking.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.840
There's a couple other teeny tiny search engines out there.

11:03.840 --> 11:04.400
There's Bing.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.760
There's DuckDuckGo.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.360
And hey, you're a tech savvy millennial.

11:07.360 --> 11:11.840
You'll just change your default search engine and go back to petting doggos laughing emoji.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.920
But here's the real problem.

11:13.920 --> 11:19.040
No matter what search engine you use, your search results are still going to suck.

11:19.040 --> 11:26.400
Because Google is now so dominant, so powerful that their choices shape the very internet itself.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.720
See, if you're not in the top Google results for a certain search term,

11:30.720 --> 11:33.200
your website is basically invisible.

11:33.280 --> 11:38.000
So a powerful industry of search engine optimization, or SEO,

11:38.000 --> 11:42.320
has sprung up to help publishers sleaze their way to the top of the results.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.800
SEO is the process of gaming Google search algorithm,

11:46.800 --> 11:51.040
giving it exactly what it wants so that it always displays your page first,

11:51.040 --> 11:53.520
regardless of whether or not it's actually the best.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.000
Google actually encourages publishers to use SEO techniques.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.120
The problem, though, is that using these techniques generally makes your website suck ass.

12:03.760 --> 12:08.880
So there's this website called HouseFresh where experts rigorously test air purifiers

12:08.880 --> 12:10.320
and then publish the results.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.160
That's literally all they do.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.120
They're an example of what the internet was supposed to be.

12:15.120 --> 12:20.880
An independent site run by real experts writing reliable articles that are actually useful.

12:20.880 --> 12:24.000
And Google is slowly murdering them.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.760
In a blog post earlier this year, HouseFresh revealed how they were being

12:27.760 --> 12:31.920
massacred in the Google rankings by SEO optimized content farms

12:31.920 --> 12:36.000
that just pretend to review air purifiers to game the algorithm.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.920
The purifiers these sites recommend suck so hard,

12:39.920 --> 12:41.200
actually they don't suck hard.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.760
They suck poorly, that's the point of an air purifier,

12:43.760 --> 12:46.960
that it is obvious that no one involved with these sites

12:46.960 --> 12:49.680
has even seen them in person, much less tested them.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.160
But that doesn't matter because all Google cares about

12:52.160 --> 12:58.000
is that these sites use the keywords rigorous testing and lab team and expert on their pages.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.840
Why spend the money to actually do those things or even buy an air purifier

13:01.840 --> 13:05.760
when you can just tell Google's idiot algorithm the magic fucking words?

13:05.760 --> 13:09.760
Let's be clear, Google's only actual job as a search engine

13:09.760 --> 13:14.560
is to send me to good sites like HouseFresh rather than bullshit spam sites.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.800
But no, Google says here's a piece of shit site that lists some piece of shit products

13:18.800 --> 13:20.080
and it's number one.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.280
Aren't you feeling lucky?

13:21.840 --> 13:24.960
Optimizing your site for Google's algorithm doesn't make it better,

13:24.960 --> 13:29.360
it makes it worse, less readable, less useful, and less honest.

13:29.920 --> 13:33.840
But a site's Google rank has become so existentially important

13:33.840 --> 13:39.760
that now at least 80% of all websites use SEO in some form, 80%.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.880
That's why every time you look up a recipe now,

13:42.880 --> 13:45.680
it starts with when I started best cooking blog,

13:45.680 --> 13:48.080
I never thought it would really be best cooking blog.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.000
But now people come up to me and say,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.520
wow, you really do have the best cooking blog for best recipes,

13:53.520 --> 13:55.600
tasty recipes, go-to recipes,

13:55.600 --> 13:58.960
and also the best tasty go-to recipes for hungry daughters.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.160
Anyway, I'm going to be sharing my best tasty go-to recipe

14:02.160 --> 14:04.320
for how to hard boil an egg.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.680
First, buy an egg.

14:05.680 --> 14:08.720
When online shopping for best deals on tasty eggs, I...

14:12.800 --> 14:14.960
This fucking sucks.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.760
It doesn't matter what search engine you use

14:17.760 --> 14:20.800
because the entire internet is now just an endless stream

14:20.800 --> 14:24.080
of generic, content-free SEO barf.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.960
And it's all Google's goddamn fault.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.480
They threw up in the pool and we're all swimming in it.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.040
I mean, the internet was supposed to be

14:33.040 --> 14:36.800
the greatest source of information in the history of humankind.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.400
But Google's monopoly has created a world in which real sites

14:40.400 --> 14:42.720
that employ real journalists, real reviewers,

14:42.720 --> 14:45.440
and real experts shut down every day

14:45.440 --> 14:48.640
because they can't compete with the bullshit content farms

14:48.640 --> 14:51.120
that Google's algorithm promotes instead.

14:51.120 --> 14:54.240
And now, that so-called artificial intelligence

14:54.240 --> 14:57.600
is about to flood the internet with even more dumbass spam?

14:57.600 --> 14:58.880
What is Google doing?

14:58.880 --> 15:02.560
They're jamming AI into the fucking search engine itself.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.800
So now, instead of just serving you the barf,

15:04.800 --> 15:07.280
Google's AI is going to ingest the barf for you,

15:07.280 --> 15:10.560
then barf it back at you in hopes that you'll swallow it down

15:10.560 --> 15:12.480
like some kind of vomit oroborus.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.120
I mean, what the fuck happened to Don't Be Evil?

15:15.120 --> 15:17.440
Did they just take that sign off the wall?

15:17.440 --> 15:18.960
Oh, yeah, they did.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.480
And then they shot that dude in the head.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.720
Google built its fortune on the forest of links,

15:24.720 --> 15:28.080
the deep structure of an internet created by humans.

15:28.640 --> 15:32.080
But after they won, they used their money and power

15:32.080 --> 15:35.040
to destroy that forest and make sure nothing else

15:35.040 --> 15:36.960
could ever grow in its place.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.600
And nothing is more evil than that.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.280
Now, I know that all sounds pretty bleak,

15:43.280 --> 15:45.280
but there is a way to fix it.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.560
And in fact, the phrase Don't Be Evil

15:48.560 --> 15:51.520
is itself a reference to the last tech monopoly

15:51.520 --> 15:54.640
that we needed to cut down to size, Microsoft.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.400
See, back in the 90s, Microsoft was a ruthless giant

15:58.400 --> 16:00.720
that sought to dominate the computer industry

16:00.720 --> 16:02.560
and the internet itself.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.080
Everyone hated them.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.800
They were using their monopoly over the operating system,

16:06.800 --> 16:10.080
Windows, to gain an unfair advantage over the internet,

16:10.080 --> 16:12.800
bundling their crappy web browser internet explorer

16:12.800 --> 16:14.960
as the default so that competitors

16:14.960 --> 16:16.400
couldn't break into the market.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.640
And the fear was that if Microsoft was allowed

16:18.640 --> 16:21.280
to establish monopoly control over the software

16:21.280 --> 16:22.880
we used to connect to the web,

16:22.880 --> 16:24.560
they'd be able to kill competition

16:24.560 --> 16:26.560
across the entire internet.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.040
Microsoft even had internal conversations

16:29.040 --> 16:30.800
in which they discussed directing users

16:30.800 --> 16:34.240
to Microsoft search sites if they typed in Google.com.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.120
Well, you know what happened next?

16:37.120 --> 16:39.360
The federal government sued them

16:39.360 --> 16:41.440
for violating antitrust law.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.920
And even though that case was eventually settled,

16:43.920 --> 16:46.480
just the threat of federal enforcement

16:46.480 --> 16:50.000
actually caused Microsoft to change their business practices.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.840
Microsoft's own lawyers admitted

16:51.840 --> 16:54.240
that the constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper

16:54.240 --> 16:57.040
all the time actually made them behave differently

16:57.040 --> 17:00.080
because no one wanted to test the regulators anymore.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.880
Microsoft stopped trying to monopolize the internet,

17:02.880 --> 17:04.640
giving new startups like Google

17:04.640 --> 17:06.880
the space they needed to grow and flourish.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.560
That's right.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.280
Google, the biggest of all big tech companies

17:11.280 --> 17:14.160
only exists because the government was willing to step in

17:14.160 --> 17:16.560
and kick some big tech ass.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.680
This is why we need antitrust enforcement.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.360
If monopolistic companies

17:21.360 --> 17:23.920
are allowed to strangle their competitors in the crib

17:23.920 --> 17:26.880
like Microsoft used to do and like Google does today,

17:26.880 --> 17:28.560
they'll never be able to grow up

17:28.560 --> 17:31.120
into those energetic idealistic teenagers

17:31.120 --> 17:32.080
that change the world.

17:32.800 --> 17:33.760
So you know what?

17:33.760 --> 17:35.040
If we want to fix this,

17:35.040 --> 17:37.440
our government needs to get off of its ass

17:37.440 --> 17:39.440
enforce our antitrust laws

17:39.440 --> 17:41.760
and start punishing the assholes who...

17:42.640 --> 17:43.840
Oh, never mind.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.360
I'm seeing that the Department of Justice

17:45.360 --> 17:47.120
actually sued Google months ago.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.200
Sorry, force of habit.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.920
I'm just not used to the government like doing its job ever.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.000
Hope they win.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.280
And you should too.

17:55.280 --> 17:55.920
Because you know what?

17:55.920 --> 17:57.440
There's tech pundits out there

17:57.440 --> 18:00.080
who will try to tell you that this is government overreach,

18:00.080 --> 18:03.040
that the government shouldn't meddle in big tech.

18:03.040 --> 18:06.800
And that's a lie that we all need to start pushing back on.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.000
Because if we don't,

18:08.000 --> 18:11.360
well, we better all start learning to boil an egg in barf.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.040
