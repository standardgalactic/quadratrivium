0	4640	Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.
4640	9120	You know, we all know that poverty is a bad thing and I think most of us agree
9120	14240	that the world would be a better place if poverty didn't exist or at least were greatly reduced.
14240	19200	It's not just the human suffering that makes poverty bad. It's also bad for an entire society
19200	25600	if a large group of people can barely survive. That's why LBJ waged a war on poverty and in the
25600	33040	booming 1960s, the poverty rate indeed went down a huge 39%. But if we won a couple battles on
33040	40400	poverty back then, we have lost the war since. You know, we had a 13% poverty rate in 1980
40400	48320	and an 11.5% poverty rate in 2000. But that rate was basically the same last year, 23 years later.
48320	52320	And you know, we talked to some extent in this country about how poverty is bad. We should
52320	58320	talk about it more. But you know what we almost never discuss? How bad extreme wealth is. The
58320	65440	super wealthy are bad for our society. America has 800 billionaires. They're mainly men and it is
65440	70560	obviously bad that these people have so much money because just as being poor makes you less
70560	76080	likely to be able to participate in society as a citizen. Huge amounts of wealth give you a gross
76080	81520	and unfair amount of political power. And you know what? Since we live in a democracy, I think
81600	86000	that's a bad thing. You know, we're happy to have conversations about getting rid of poverty,
86000	91040	but why are we so much less comfortable talking about eradicating extreme wealth? Because if
91040	96640	extreme wealth is just as damaging to our society as poverty, why can't we imagine waging a war on
96640	101360	that too? It's not just a foregone conclusion that we live in a society where some people are
101360	106720	unelected god emperors with treasure palaces and apocalypse bunkers and unilateral control over
106720	112640	our political system. It is not right or natural that unearned hereditary wealth can be passed down
112640	117920	for centuries. Last time I checked, we had a couple revolutions to end that sort of thing and then
117920	123440	we were all taught in school that it's bad. So concentration of wealth and power is simply
123440	128640	undemocratic. And if you think democracy is the right system to decide how we run our society
128640	134560	collectively, well, I think you'd have to say that that concentration is bad. So what kind of
134560	139760	arguments can we actually make against the existence of the wealthy? What limits should
139760	145840	be placed on wealth and why? This is a radical conversation to have, but it gets less radical
145840	150400	the more you consider it. There's a name for the philosophical view that wealth should be
150400	155920	drastically limited. It's called libertarianism. And my guest today came up with this view and
155920	160000	has advanced the very best arguments for it. But before we get into the argument,
160000	163120	which I know you're going to love, I just want to remind you that if you want to support this

184000	189040	is the political philosopher Ingrid Robins. She holds the chair in ethics of institutions at the
189040	194640	Ethics Institute of Utrecht University and her new book is called Limiterianism, The Case Against
194640	201840	Extreme Wealth. Please welcome Ingrid Robins. Ingrid, thank you so much for being on the show with us
201840	206320	today. Thank you for having me. So tell me a little bit about your background, the work that you do
206320	211600	and why you have concluded that it is a bad thing for us to have billionaires striding around the
211600	217440	earth. Yes. So I'm actually going to argue that it's not just bad to have billionaires, but that
217440	224880	it's bad to have deca millionaires, people who have more than 10 million euros, pounds, dollars
224880	230720	in a context such as the Netherlands. But I'm sure we will get to that later. So I'm a professor
230720	237280	of political philosophy. I'm also trained as an economist and I have been working in my academic
237280	244640	research for the last 20 years on questions of inequality. And often when we think about inequality,
244720	249520	especially economists, they focus on the poor. They think we should solve poverty. But I think
249520	256240	we've now entered a phase in the history of human societies where we should also really
256240	261520	increasingly worry about wealth and wealth concentration. Of course, I'm not the first
261520	266400	to say this. I'm not the last to say this. But what I've tried to do is to write a book where
266400	270160	I focused on the moral arguments. Why shouldn't we have people that are too rich?
270800	273280	And so tell me what some of those arguments are. Why shouldn't we?
274000	280320	Yeah. So it's actually, I have a number of them. There are different types. One is that often the
280320	286160	money is earned in a way that makes it stained. So people should not have gotten it in the first
286160	292960	place. An important argument is that it's too much wealth harm societies, either because it
292960	299280	undermines democracy or because it's incompatible with principles of ecological sustainability.
299280	304480	And then there is the fundamental philosophical argument that I think nobody can say they deserve
305520	309760	to be super rich and deserve in a moral sense. And there's a final argument which
310560	314720	some people don't take too serious, which is that it's actually not good for the super rich
314720	324320	themselves because it doesn't make them happy. I'm sorry, that's the funniest argument. To go
324320	330560	up to Jeff Bezos and be like, yeah, dude, but you're sad. I saw you crying. You are not a happy man.
331200	336560	The thing is, there is actually some evidence that wealth accumulation works as an addiction.
336560	342880	So if we are worried as human beings, that our fellow human beings can be addicted to any type
342880	348960	of drugs, and we see that also in the brain accumulating money works in the same way,
348960	354480	then we should probably also feel some empathy for those who are just locked up in this,
354480	359520	not just desire, but this compulsion to just keep accumulating money. It does change the
359520	366320	character of the super rich. That is basically the argument. And let me put it politely, not
366320	372400	necessarily for the better. Yeah, it must be a compulsion to keep accumulating money because
372400	377120	there is a point, I think we know from social science, very soon where you earn a certain
377200	383680	amount of money and your happiness tops out. You don't get happier if you have $11 million
383680	389520	versus $10 million, but there is a compulsion to keep earning more and to keep growing and growing.
390640	395040	I feel it myself sometimes too when I'm making this podcast, I'm touring around doing stand-up
395040	399840	comedy, and then I'm spending my nights writing a new YouTube video because I want to get a couple
399840	405600	more views. And sometimes I go, wait, why am I doing this? Does it match my goals? And I look
405600	410240	through, yeah, I think it does right now, but it also might just be that compulsion to do more,
410240	414960	more, more all the time. And I could see that really, if you're a banker on Wall Street or
414960	419600	something like that, and your entire job is that number at the bottom of your spreadsheet,
419600	423200	there would be a compulsion to have more and more all the time, and there would be nothing else
423200	428640	behind it. Yeah, so talking about Wall Street, there was a Wall Street trader, I can't remember
428640	433680	the exact year, but I mean, about 10 years ago, who wrote a piece in the New York Times, and then
433680	440560	later also a book where he mentioned that he was a Wall Street trader, he had no kids, no philanthropic
441280	448960	goal to work for, no debts. And still he was angry because his annual bonus had only been like
448960	454320	3 million, and why wasn't it more? And then he realized this was really like an addiction he
454320	462400	had earlier, had some, some alcohol addiction, I think. And so that's really the idea of the
462480	469600	addiction is, it's not an idea, there is really some, some evidence in how it works. And there's
469600	474800	also an interesting little book written called The Psychology of Money by somebody who advises,
474800	481360	who's a financial advisor, who also says, the only way to really not start to do kind of crazy
481360	486880	things or criminal things or to let it take over your life is by just saying, okay, until here,
486880	492160	and not further. This is my goal. And then that's all I need. That's all I want. And it,
492160	498560	it, it liberates people to not want to want to have more. It gives peace of mind. But anyway,
498560	503600	I actually think this argument for the super rich themselves, I mentioned it as the last one,
503600	508800	because I think the really important ones are that it harms us and that it's undeserved. These
508800	512480	are the fundamental ones. Well, let's get to those first. I mean, that was a very good piece of
512480	516720	practical advice for Jeff Bezos, if he's listening to the show, set a limit, and then just
516720	523600	stop Jeff and get some sleep. But you can look at what his ex-wife did. I know. She's giving it
523600	530480	all away. And she's giving it away in a very interesting manner, because she, she's not like
530480	535760	deciding what the money must go to, but she's giving it to organizations who within themselves
535760	540080	take control and can decide what to do with it. Yeah. And we've talked about that in a, in a past
540080	544560	episode of the show on billionaire philanthropy and the problems with it. And she's perhaps doing,
544560	551120	there's still problems with philanthropy at that level, but she is sort of the least bad
551840	558720	someone is giving money away for that reason. If you want to commend that at all. Let's talk,
558720	563600	though, about this very enticing argument you make that no one deserves that amount of money.
563600	567760	You say no one can really argue that they deserve that amount of money. I have to say,
567760	572560	I live in the United States. I hear people make that argument every day. I mean, I've made,
572640	576720	every time I make a video about Elon Musk, people say, Oh, well, you know, why don't you have all
576720	580720	that money? It's because you suck. That's the only reason you don't have it. If you were as good
580720	585520	and smart and wonderful a person as Elon, you would have earned the money because he deserved it,
585520	589920	and you didn't. So what is your counter argument to that? Yeah. So, I mean, what you're just
589920	595440	describing is really the way this, I mean, I think the word we should really use is ideology,
595440	601920	this meritocrats, neoliberal ideology that, that puts always the focus on the individual
601920	606640	and thinks that the individual deserves something. And if they are economically successful, it's
606640	611680	because of their own something to do with themselves. If they're miserable, they can be blamed.
611680	617680	That kind of framework, that kind of ideology, which we have increasingly come to think
618560	623760	is not the only way to look at human beings. And actually, once upon a time, we looked
623760	629840	differently at human beings. This way of thinking has, has also not fallen from the sky. It has come
629840	636400	from a deliberate movement of first thinkers and then politicians who increasingly made us
636400	641040	think like this. So this is just by way of background. So what do I think is based on
641040	649120	what I've been reading in, in various types of scientific fields? What do I think is the real
649120	655360	way we should look at human beings? I think we should put luck central. And luck comes in different
655360	662080	forms. The first form is what you could call biological luck or the natural lottery. The
662080	668720	genes you have are not of your own choice. So you can't say I chose my genes. The credits for my
668720	676240	good genes are mine because you didn't choose your genes, your talents, your creativity. Also,
676240	683120	the stamina, are you able to work really hard? Are you able to, to do long days,
683120	687600	difference quite radically between people? There is only so much of this that can be really trained
687600	693600	and learned. It is also just kind of difference between people. And if you happen to have what we
693600	698960	philosophers call drone, a good, a good ticket from the natural lottery, you should count your
698960	703760	blessings rather than saying, look what a fantastic human person I am. So that is the first type of
703760	710560	luck. And the problem and why I focus on luck is because luck can never be the basis for dessert.
710560	715840	That is the fundamental equation in this argument that if you want to say that you deserve
715840	721040	something, you must always trace your achievement back to something for which you can take credit.
721040	726480	And you can't, by definition, take credit for luck. So the first type of luck is natural luck.
726480	732080	The second type is social luck. The parents you were born with, the social class, the city,
732080	738320	the country. If you're born in the US, your opportunities are vastly bigger than if you're
738880	745040	born in, say, Afghanistan. And we don't choose where we are born. We don't choose our parents,
745040	749680	which also means we don't choose our inheritance, if any, because that's also a type of luck.
750240	758080	And then the last type of luck is what economists call market luck. So if you have two entrepreneurs
758080	763840	who are equally willing to really go the extra mile, put in all the hours, take the risks,
763840	769520	then it can still be the case that one of them, because of the way markets work and they often
769520	776960	allocate the big prices to one winner, its winner takes all markets, that their luck also plays a
776960	786240	role. And while luck may only play a small role in deciding who takes the big price and who
786240	795520	basically disappears or takes a smaller role, say, as an artist, luck sometimes is really the
795520	802320	pivotal thing. So there is an interesting book written by an economist called Robert Frank,
802320	808240	an American economist. It's called Success and Luck. I think that's the title. And he explains
808240	814640	based on studies that, for example, if companies have to decide which CEO they need to hire,
815360	821360	all these CEOs are extremely talented, they're very skilled, they are experienced.
822320	827520	What then makes the difference? It's this tiny little bit of luck. So even though luck may not
827520	834000	play in absolute numbers, a very big role in deciding who becomes very wealthy and who doesn't,
834000	840640	it is the factor that makes a difference. So if we then embrace this view that luck plays
840640	846480	such a big role in our lives, then I think the right attitude, if we're economically successful,
846480	852400	if we become rich, is really to be generous towards those that were less lucky. And that,
852400	858160	I totally agree, is really fundamentally at odds with the prevailing view in society.
859520	864560	Yeah, with entrepreneurs so much of the time, it matters to be in the right place at the right
864560	870800	time that if you were selling masks or video conference software in early 2020,
871440	876560	something very lucky happened to you that March, that caused your business to skyrocket.
876560	881600	It wasn't because of your great intelligence, you didn't know what was going to happen, etc.
881600	885920	Or if you were, I don't know, making steel at the right time during World War II or whatever
885920	892160	it was, that these things happen that we can't take personal responsibility for.
892720	898640	I used to, one of the first philosophical questions I can remember asking myself as a child was,
899520	903760	why am I here in the United States? Why is my consciousness here in the United States?
903760	908000	And this body as opposed to any other. And it's still something that I find fundamentally
908000	913200	mysterious. The fact that there's many humans and I am but one of them and I happen to be this one,
913200	918240	and why am I not a different one? And it's a cosmic dice roll.
918960	927120	Yeah, absolutely. And once you start to really realize the enormous luck we have to be born in
927120	934480	a country where I feel still every day blessed that I'm also in a country, so I prefer countries that
934480	942560	have decent social security systems. I mean, decent welfare states also for the compatriots
942560	946640	that are less lucky, people who are disabled or who become unemployed or whatever.
947600	952880	Yeah, I still feel lucky that I happened to be here. I could also have been somewhere else.
953600	958880	And I think once you realize this, I mean, so it's really, so it's both like, how do we treat
958880	967360	each other? How do we allocate kind of, yeah, not just financial rewards, but also, I guess,
967360	971760	empathy to other people because it's not just this works, not just towards those that are
971920	977760	extremely successful. I think we should still congratulate people. So you can congratulate
977760	984640	me with my book. I will take the congratulations. I can congratulate you with your show. I still,
984640	989600	all of that is fine because in the end, we do, we do put in an effort and it would be kind of
989600	995440	strange to treat each other as determinist robots. That's not what I'm arguing for,
995440	1002480	but I still kind of a bit of modesty would really, I think, change the way we
1004560	1008560	are generous or not, but also the way we organize society.
1008560	1013520	Yeah. Well, let's talk about some of the other reasons for that humility in a little bit, but I
1013520	1019280	want to get to first what I think is your main argument, which is that billionaires and people
1019280	1024880	who are overdecor millionaires are bad for the rest of society, that this sort of concentration
1024960	1029680	is a bad thing in and of itself, even if one were to think one deserves it.
1030720	1035280	It's even if a very deserving billionaire were to exist and we're all to say, yes,
1035280	1039440	very good job. We have no problems with how you did it and with you having this money,
1039440	1042320	that would still be bad. And tell me why you think that is.
1042320	1048560	Yeah. So I think the case of how well concentration undermines democracy,
1048560	1052320	so the principle of political equality is the clearest and especially in the US.
1053040	1060160	I mean, American political scientists have written papers and books where they argue that
1060160	1066720	the US is actually no longer a democracy, but an oligarchy or plutocracy because of the way
1066720	1072080	money influences politics. And money can influence politics in different ways.
1072720	1077360	The most obvious is donations, donations to political parties or to candidates.
1077920	1083440	And I mean, that is, I think, a significant difference between the US and Europe because
1083440	1089600	we have quite strict rulings on how much you can donate to a political candidate.
1089600	1097440	Actually, in my country, in the Netherlands, the last government made that rule even more
1097440	1103360	stricter. They decided that each person can give a maximum of 100,000 euros per person
1103360	1109200	per year to politics. Of course, those who want to really have a bigger influence on politics
1109200	1113920	will still try to find a way around, but it's difficult. And also, all the donations to political
1113920	1117200	parties are in an open register, so everybody can see what happens.
1118320	1125040	In the US, as you know, much better than I do. I mean, money can really buy politics quite
1125840	1131680	significantly. And it's also quite difficult to stand for political office if you don't have what
1131760	1139280	they call a war chest. So that is unfortunately the reality. So that's one... And then what political
1139280	1146400	scientists have shown is that the policies that follow are really skewed towards the interests
1146400	1152560	of the rich. And that is the first problem. The second problem is... Or the second mechanism
1152560	1156720	in which this happens is... Let me just dwell on the first problem a little bit, if that's okay.
1157680	1164160	That... I think we sort of don't talk enough about what we mean by democracy and political
1164160	1168320	equality, which is that it's the ability of average people to have a say in how the country
1168320	1175200	is run and for there to be some level of equality there. And if a small number of people have a
1175200	1181280	vast amount more power than everybody else, that's a major step back towards a monarchy or
1181360	1187600	towards a aristocracy where a small number of people are literally running the society that
1187600	1192800	we live in. And it's one of those things where I was like, oh, I was just brought up being told
1192800	1199200	that's what the American Revolution was about. That's not American values is for a small number
1199200	1204000	of people to lord over the rest of us. But that's what inevitably happens when there's too much
1204000	1212720	concentrated wealth. Yes. And I really think it is... I mean, the book that I wrote, when I
1212720	1217680	talk about it in continental Europe, I often get the reaction, yeah, yeah, but you know, this is
1217680	1223120	really an American problem, what you're describing. And it's not true. I mean, I have also lots of
1224080	1228800	scientific studies that show and also arguments that show that some of the problems are also really
1228880	1234400	universal problems and they play in Europe too. But the problem about how money translates,
1234400	1240880	so basically financial power, translating political power, is everywhere. But it's
1240880	1246560	especially, I think, a problem in the US because the walls that you have to build between the sphere
1246560	1254240	of money and the sphere of politics in the US are, they're very weak. Yeah. Also because, I mean,
1254240	1260320	if you say that companies that give money is a form of speech, yeah, then of course, I mean,
1260320	1269920	what is this kind of reasoning? And that is, I guess, a very specific problem for the US.
1269920	1274720	It's funny that you mentioned monarchies because I've lived all my life in monarchies,
1274720	1279920	first in Belgium and then in the Netherlands. But you know, our monarchs have like almost no power.
1279920	1285440	Yeah. In Belgium, they say that actually the monarch keeps the country together.
1286640	1290560	That's the main role they play. They're kept in such a little box. I mean,
1291520	1295600	I knew some people who are a little mad about all the gossip about the British royal family.
1296320	1301440	And I'm like, that is all they're for at this point. They're just there for everyone else
1301440	1308640	to gossip about. This is the only purpose. They have no other role. Yeah, they play different
1308880	1313520	role. They have in any case very little political power. I think the question you asked about what
1313520	1319040	is democracy really is a fundamental one. So it is not just having the right to vote.
1319040	1325840	It's also being able to vote. So for example, not having you be hindered from voting. It's also,
1325840	1333280	I mean, all the other factors that can prevent people from voting, but also political participation.
1333280	1338320	In the end, the ideal democracy, which will of course, which is an ideal, so we will never be
1338400	1345760	able to fully reach that is that we govern ourselves together. That means that everybody who wants to
1345760	1351760	and has an interest has an equal potential influence on society. And we are very far from this.
1352320	1359040	And the influence of the disproportionate influence of the very rich on politics
1359040	1363840	is not just directly via politics, but also for example, because of the way they influence the
1363840	1369520	public sphere. So if you have somebody like Rupert Murdoch, who just kind of buys up first in
1369520	1377520	Australia, then in the UK and now in the US, who buys up media power and really becomes a very
1377520	1386320	important factor that shapes the public discourse, then you create, from money, you create power
1386320	1391440	that is a form of political power. Politics is not just about voting. I mean, this is an open door
1391440	1397040	we all know this, but we have to then really think like, what are the preconditions for robust
1397040	1404800	democracy? And I think that having, for example, also public institutions that are outside the sphere
1404800	1411280	of money, like have education outside, so no, to have basically high quality public education,
1412080	1418640	high quality public universities, high quality public media, these are all, I think,
1418640	1425280	very important to get a kind of political ecosystem that protects democracy. And the problem is that
1425280	1430800	money undermines this. There's a broader vision of democracy that I'm always trying to promote on
1430800	1435920	this show, which is because the one that we're brought up with is so limited to you vote, you
1435920	1441440	donate, maybe you protest and hold a sign, that's it. And that's all democracy is. But no, democracy
1441440	1447840	is having participation in all of how your society is run and making sure that it reflects the will
1447840	1454160	of all of the people. And that includes things like media or the conditions under which you work
1454160	1459600	or the town that you live in. So if a billionaire is so powerful that they can buy an entire
1459600	1463680	communications media and start bending it to their will, like Elon Musk did with Twitter,
1463680	1470640	or if a billionaire is so powerful that they can buy your entire town and control the
1472400	1476880	buildings that you live in, like, I forget the name of the guy, but the Warren Buffett's partner,
1476880	1482800	who's a billionaire, you know, designed his own dorm room for like a thousand students in, I believe
1482800	1487680	UC Berkeley, that's like a horrible jail. But he was able to do it because he had so much money,
1487680	1491280	he could donate and donate it and say, build a building like this, because it's my idea and
1491280	1494240	they're doing it. And it's going to be horrible. Everyone who lives there is going to be miserable.
1494240	1499600	But the only reason it happened is because this man had so much power, that kind of power over
1499600	1505120	the world, the rest of us live in is undemocratic, even when it doesn't touch our political system
1505120	1510880	properly conceived, you know, narrowly conceived. It's, it's, we don't want to live in a society
1510880	1515840	where one or two people are able to control the rest of us like that. That's not the fucking
1515840	1521520	point of this. Yeah. And there's actually two things that make it even worse. One is that once,
1522640	1530880	so often, the super rich, the multimillionaires, they also kind of, they used politics, then
1530880	1538720	basically politicians for their own purposes. So they, I mean, they, so Abigail Disney made
1538720	1547360	a film about her, her, the company of her, her grandfather. And she talks about the Disney
1547360	1554560	Park in, in, in California. In Anaheim. Yes, exactly. I was, I was trying to find a word.
1554560	1558240	Thanks for having me. I'm an expert in Southern California geography. If I have any questions
1558240	1563680	for you about Utrecht, you'll let me know. Yes, that's a good, that's a deal. So,
1565040	1570080	so she, and the movie is actually very, so it's a documentary, and it's very revealing because
1570080	1576080	it doesn't, it really shows how like they, they also, because they become so important and so
1576080	1582560	influential, the local government also just starts to do stuff for the company that makes
1582560	1588560	it even richer. Yes. And this mechanism where really you see the, I mean, I described in the book
1588560	1592960	a couple of really, really bad cases, like the kleptocrats, which we have in, I mean,
1592960	1596800	Putin is a good example, Berlusconi in Italy was a good example we had,
1597920	1603600	but you have them everywhere. And, and so it becomes really bad at all levels. So that's an
1603600	1610000	additional problem. But another problem is that the super rich, the billionaires, also no longer
1610000	1615840	become so rich that they kind of almost no longer need democracy. So we ordinary folks,
1615840	1620720	we need each other, we need each other to survive, to have good lives. But if you look at what people
1620720	1627200	like Peter Thiel does, so I don't know whether how much this has been discussed in the US, but
1627200	1634880	and I'm sure I don't know all the details myself, but he took on additional citizenship in New
1634960	1641600	Zealand, which is very, very difficult to get. The reason he could get it was because of some
1641600	1648080	contributions to the to the economy of New Zealand. And then he needed that because he wanted to buy
1648080	1654960	some unsupported lands. And that lands, which is close to a lake that is actually sacred for the
1654960	1661120	local indigenous people, the Maori, he can go there and live there with his friends when the
1661120	1666880	apocalypse hits US. And then you also, of course, have the super rich with their bunkers. So they
1666880	1672960	have all these strategies, I mean, Musk going to space is another example, rather than trying to fix
1672960	1678880	the problems that we have collectively on this planet. Yes, they have these escape fantasies.
1678880	1683520	But some of them, it's not just fantasies. I mean, if you, if you, if you have a private
1683520	1689440	jet or you have multiple private jets, and you just have bought a really nice piece of land in
1689440	1694640	New Zealand, and you just say, okay, when shit hits the fan, I just take my friends and we fly
1694640	1700560	there. Yeah. Well, this is a fantasy that so many people have. I think it's not just a fantasy of
1700560	1705600	the wealthy. The average people have the fantasy of I want a little compound out in the middle
1705600	1711040	of nowhere. I want to just, you know, have some goats and, you know, not need anyone and have a
1711040	1715920	safe place for me and my polycule or whatever it is, people want to, you know, get together.
1716880	1721920	But, you know, I think for average people, well, we can't really do it because we're so dependent
1721920	1727120	on others. Ultimately, at the end of the day, billionaires are able to live in the fantasy
1727120	1733280	world where their dependency on others is so abstracted away from them is so small, you know.
1733280	1739200	They don't see the, you know, Amazon factory workers, you know, making minimum wage, 12-hour
1739200	1743920	days, you know, peeing in bottles that they are actually dependent on for their wealth.
1743920	1749440	They have the ideology they did it themselves and that, you know, they can go sequester themselves
1749440	1756080	separately away from everyone. I'd like to get into the economic argument. What is bad about
1756640	1761920	having a small number of people with incredible concentrations of wealth for the economy and
1761920	1769040	for, you know, everyone else's earnings? Yes. So I actually don't, in my book, I don't spend a lot
1769040	1775280	of time talking about the economic argument because as a, as a philosopher, for me, the economy
1775280	1780400	is a means to enhance. And the answer is the things that are valuable. It is our well-being,
1780400	1785840	our flourishing, our freedoms, our possibility to shape the life, how we want it to have.
1785840	1791600	So the economy is a means to that. Still, I understand that you want to have a flourishing
1791600	1796880	economy because it really helps us to have these good lives. And so many people are actually
1796880	1804720	primarily moved by the economic arguments for limiting inequality. And the argument is that
1804720	1812400	increasingly the, the rhetorics that we've been told since the 80s, namely that if you allow
1812400	1818240	the rich to become as rich as they can and inequality is like a price to pay for them
1818240	1824880	becoming so rich, everybody will benefit. So that's trickle-down theory. Trickle-down theory is just
1824880	1831200	a piece of, a piece of theory. It's actually proven not to be true. Has that ever happened? I don't
1831200	1838720	think so. No, so the Australian economist, John Quiggin has a really nice term for this.
1838720	1845520	He calls them, he has written a book called Zombie Economics. And so basically he says
1845520	1849760	there's a couple of ideas. Actually, they're dead, but once in a while they keep coming back.
1849760	1854880	And of course, with trickle-down economics, we've seen in the UK that this trust,
1854880	1860640	who was the prime minister for what, like 80 days, that she really believed in trickle-down
1860640	1868400	economics. Trickle-down economics is kind of a, it's like a pretext to be able to let the rich
1868400	1874800	pay fewer taxes because we see that this doesn't work. If you want to grow the economy, you need
1874800	1882000	to invest in the human capital of everybody. That means make sure people are healthy, that the
1882000	1888960	communities are safe, and that they have good education and decent housing. And then you really
1888960	1894880	release the potential of people. And then of course, you need not too much bureaucracy and all that
1894880	1900640	kind of stuff. And that is, so that means that if you reduce inequality, it actually has a positive
1900640	1907280	effect on economic growth. And the opposite, so the idea that inequality is kind of the price to
1907280	1915360	pay for overall more economic growth, was the view that neoliberal economists have been pushing in
1915360	1924240	the 70s and the 80s. And that was standard, standardly believed to be true until, I don't know the
1924240	1931840	exact year, but at some point, some years ago, even the IMF, which is seen as the headquarters of
1932560	1937280	this kind of neoliberal thinking, at some point said, no, inequality can really become too big.
1937280	1942880	And then it just, independent of all the other factors, it hurts the economy. So there's even
1942880	1947600	no longer even a business case for inequality. There is however a case for those that are super
1947600	1951680	rich, because they can still become more richer and richer and richer.
1951760	1957440	Right. They can say, oh, it's working great for me. We can say, hey, we've been trying your strategy
1957440	1962960	of inequality fueling the economy for the past 50 years at least, doesn't seem like it's going
1962960	1967680	that great, right? Nobody thinks the world economy is in very healthy shape right now, nor has it
1967680	1973200	has, nor has it been since the 90s, I would say, that people were like, oh, things are going great.
1974320	1979760	And inequality has skyrocketed. It seems like these two things have gone together. And that,
1980240	1984640	might be time to try something new in terms of macroeconomics.
1984640	1992160	So I really think the problem is that we, and then when I say we, I mean ordinary folks,
1992160	1999920	we like not to talk about economics. We think economics is complicated. We think it's boring.
1999920	2005440	So we leave all of that to other people. And then of course, when politicians tell us something
2005440	2010960	about the economy, yeah, we have no idea what, so we basically believe them because they have
2010960	2015680	beautiful eyes or because we think they're a guy with whom we cannot go and have a beer at the
2015680	2024480	barbecue. You mean listen to the economists because they have beautiful eyes? I don't know what the
2024480	2031440	reason is, but I think we have, we should really empower ourselves in terms of economic literacy
2031440	2037440	so that we are able to really question what politicians are telling us when they propose
2037440	2042160	economic policies. Well, I've heard this argument and I actually would really like to get someone
2042160	2047600	on the show to dive into it. The argument that economics has been treated as perhaps too hard
2047600	2052960	of a science for the past few decades and that politicians will tend to listen to economists.
2052960	2056160	The economist says, blah, blah, blah. And so, oh, well, the economist said it. We must do it
2056160	2062160	without realizing that economics is a very interpretive field, that there's a lot of
2062160	2069040	ideology in it, and that we've been listening to a field that's been dominated by a certain
2069040	2074880	ideology of economics for a very long time without really questioning it, which is not the case in
2074880	2082480	sciences such as physics, climatology, et cetera. These are sciences that have a lot more objective
2082480	2087520	reality to it, but economics is a social science. And it's as though we were all listening to Freudian
2087520	2092000	psychoanalysts as though they were telling us the truth. Well, there's a lot of truth in it,
2092000	2096080	but we know that that's one school among many, and that's sort of the same thing that's happened
2096080	2102240	with economics. Yeah, no, that's absolutely true. Yeah, so basically, you hit the nail. Yeah, that's
2102240	2109920	just true. But I should also say, I think the politicians, when they talk about economics,
2110000	2114720	they really cherry pick what they like. And they also cherry pick, of course, the economists they
2114720	2122080	will put into their advisors, because economists, although I also really have a lot of criticism
2122080	2128320	on economics as an academic discipline, I also think, for example, economists have been arguing
2128320	2135440	for pricing the damage we do to the environment for as long as I can remember. I remember when I
2135440	2142000	was an economic student, and that's like more than 30 years ago, that we had a professor already
2142000	2149200	having a whole team of researchers talking about what economists then call internalizing
2149200	2153920	the negative externalities into the price. So basically, how can you make sure that if somebody
2153920	2159920	sells a product, that the harm to the environment is actually factored into the price so that
2159920	2164720	they will sell less and that there will be some compensation. And there you just see that we
2164720	2171760	are still ruining the environment. So I think it's a mixed thing about how much we should blame
2171760	2178080	economists as a profession. But I do think it's definitely the case that they have become very,
2179680	2187040	yeah, they've weeded out all the heterodox, what we tend to call heterodox schools. And they've also,
2187040	2191680	and then I'm talking really as somebody who first studied economics and then studied philosophy,
2191680	2199120	they have tried to pretend to be like physics. Some economic methodologies call this the physics
2199120	2208720	envy among economists. And there's papers written about this. But economics, because it's about
2208720	2214480	society ultimately, is also about what we owe to each other. And that is the core of
2214480	2221600	ethics and political philosophy. So you can't separate economics from normative questions,
2221600	2228160	what is good, what is desirable, what is better. And that for me is really where I like to make a
2228160	2234720	contribution. And economics is built on, it's a human thing, right? Money is something that humans
2234720	2242240	invented, right? I love the writer, Yvonne O'Hurrari, who I don't always agree with,
2242320	2247120	but has a wonderful argument about poverty is imaginary. We made it up. It's not a feature of
2247120	2251520	the natural universe. It's a human thing that we created that some people have a lot of money and
2251520	2255920	some people don't. And people tomorrow could decide to do something different and different rules
2255920	2259840	would apply. And that's a fundamental way that economics is different from physics, because
2259840	2265280	the same is not true. But this is, here, you're talking about poverty. I mean, this is really a
2265280	2271360	very, very interesting example of how economics is not just economics, but also economic policy
2271360	2277280	judgments are ideological, because one of the arguments that have been made in favor of capitalism
2277280	2282480	in the form that we have it is look at what capitalism did with the global poor. The number
2282480	2288640	of people living in absolute poverty has really plummeted. And it's true. And then people looking
2288640	2293600	at those data will say, yeah, capitalism, no other system has ever done this. So capitalism is the
2293600	2298880	best system we have for the poor. And that's where their argument ends. And then basically,
2298880	2304080	we have to start to ask questions. What is that poverty line? It turns out that poverty line is
2304080	2312960	$2.2 per chasing power parity per day. That means what you can buy with $2.2 in the US per day.
2313680	2321600	It's not what you can buy with $2.2 in Antananarivo or a Kabul or wherever. So that means that line
2321600	2326160	is way too low. So you should have, like, say $11. And then you still see that there are still many,
2326160	2330960	many people in poverty. But I think the much more fundamental question that economists
2330960	2337040	and politicians should ask themselves is, all right, it's true. The number of people that live
2337040	2345440	in absolute poverty has become much, much smaller. But what had been alternative scenarios that would
2345440	2350480	also have been economically feasible? And are there scenarios in which that number would have
2350480	2357520	gone down much more? And I think the answer is yes. Because if you look at what we created,
2357520	2363440	all of us together with the global economy over the last couple of decades, and if you look at
2363440	2368560	the absolute shares that went to the global north and then mainly to shareholders in the
2368560	2374960	global north and what went to the garment workers in the global south, we've given them breadcrumbs.
2375760	2381760	We have taken really the vast share for ourselves. And that means that everything in the end is also
2381760	2388160	a question about how do you distribute what you produce together. And that means that
2390560	2395520	it's true that poverty is in that sense, well, imaginary, I think, I don't know what
2395520	2401760	I would use that word, but it is to some extent what we choose, because we could have chosen for
2401840	2408480	a different division of the economic gains in which we would have much fewer people in poverty.
2408480	2414000	So people say, hey, look at this, a whole lot of people used to make $1 a day. Now they make $2
2414000	2420320	a day. Capitalism is a big success. They don't point out that a bunch of other people who used to,
2420320	2426400	I don't know, make $1 million, now make $10 million. And that's where most of the gains went.
2426400	2430880	And like, well, hey, those people who make $2 now, they could have had five or 10 or 20
2430960	2436240	under a different system. You're ignoring the fact that we still have kept most of it for ourselves.

2632800	2636240	I think though that we've gone too deep in this interview without getting to the most radical
2636240	2641920	party or argument because we've set the stage for it. As a result of all this, you argue that we
2641920	2648240	literally should not allow the ultra wealthy to be so wealthy that we should put a cap on the amount
2648240	2652720	that people can. Is it earn or is it the amount of wealth that they can have? What is it?
2652720	2659200	It's half its wealth. So it's what we have. But let me just give you a bit of context.
2660080	2666720	So I say that we should strive to have a world so it's an ideal. It's not something we're going
2666720	2673760	to implement like tomorrow. I say that we should strive to have a world in which nobody is super
2673760	2681760	rich. And I propose two caps. And one is the higher is what you could call the political
2681760	2687600	or the institutional. And we should reorganize society and the economy in such a way that we
2687600	2692320	keep inequality within bounds. Now then obviously the question is where do you put that cap?
2693200	2699280	And the exact answer should be something like it should be at a level where the damages
2699280	2705360	to the political system and to the environment of the super wealthy are minimized, but there's
2705360	2712080	still enough room to let people who are motivated by financial gain do their thing. So those who
2712080	2716080	really only will work because they want to become rich, they should have enough space.
2716800	2722640	And then that's basically the tradeoff that you try to make. We got to let those sickos cook.
2723600	2728400	They're so motivated by money. There's people who are born like that every day. We got to give them
2728400	2733280	something to do or they're going to go nuts. Yes, but the question is, so some people say to me,
2733280	2738640	oh, but actually there was a book review in The Economist that says, no, this is crazy because
2738640	2743760	if people do not know that they could become super, super, super rich, they will no longer become
2743760	2750400	entrepreneurs. And then my answer is, how? Why do you think this is the case? There's no evidence.
2750400	2756000	So I think if people could become very well off, they could become really rich, but not extremely
2756000	2762800	rich. I think they would still try to be successful entrepreneurs. So I think this is again a kind
2762800	2769920	of almost an exchange of rhetorics. But what you should then do is to organize society in such a
2769920	2778960	way that, of course, the taxation would be much more progressive, that there would be taxation on
2778960	2786480	capital gains and on income from entrepreneurship at the same level as on income from labor,
2786480	2792320	which we don't have now because now we tax labor much more than we tax capital.
2796640	2803280	And then if you ask what would be the number, I think it would also depend on how society looks
2803280	2812160	like. So the more you have in a society, public goods, a decent health care system, public education
2812160	2818640	and so forth, things outside of the sphere of the market and profit making capitalism,
2819280	2826640	the more you have those things, the lower that level can be. So I suggest, but this is really
2826640	2833040	like a ballpark figure and as a start for the debate on this, that in a country such as the one
2833040	2838800	as where I live, the Netherlands, where we do have a public pension system, all of us are entitled
2838800	2844240	to public pension, which is roughly around the poverty line. And then we try to save for having
2844240	2851360	additional pension. And we have high quality public education. And we have a health care system for
2851360	2857520	all, which is it's like not like the British system, which is completely public, it's a regulated
2858320	2866400	more mixed system. I say for a society like this, 10 million. I know in the US people would say 10
2866400	2872240	million, 10 million. That's not enough. I can't even, I can't even send my kid to private school
2872240	2877600	and like fuel my private jet for 10 million. Exactly, you know, we don't need private school.
2880400	2884480	So that is the thing, of course, that you could say, well, I mean, I don't mind if people say,
2884480	2889840	well, you know, in the US, perhaps in current circumstances, make it, I don't know, 20 or 50
2889840	2896400	or even if you want 100 million, but definitely not a billion. You don't need a billion. Nobody
2896400	2901600	needs a billion. So I think the idea that that you hear in American politics that we shouldn't
2901600	2907120	have any billionaires is just not ambitious enough. So that is the political limit. Wow.
2908160	2912080	And then there is a second limit, which is really just the answer to the question,
2912080	2919200	how much do I as an individual need? Yeah. And there I did some research together with
2919200	2927040	colleagues from economic sociology, and we asked representative survey, a sample of Dutch people
2927040	2933600	where they say, so we gave them descriptions of the material quality of life of imaginary families,
2933600	2940080	and we asked to give them a label. Is this person poor, reasonably well off, well off, very well
2940080	2948320	off, rich, so rich, nobody, the phrasing was, nobody needs so much money, this is too much.
2949120	2956480	And then so we increasingly made the descriptions more affluent, and we were able then to make an
2956480	2963440	estimate of where the Dutch would draw that line. And for a family of two parents, two children,
2964320	2974320	data for 2018, so that's pre-inflation, we found that they said that around 2.2 million euros,
2974320	2978720	people say, okay, now it's enough for this family. So I think I therefore say in the book,
2978720	2983680	I think if you have as an individual, if you have one million in a country such as the Netherlands,
2983680	2990320	I have to repeat this, you have enough. And I should say, I often give lectures to citizens
2990320	2996720	where I'm in a debate. And then I'm sometimes challenged that somebody says, but why a million,
2996720	3002720	why not much, isn't that too low? And then I just ask people in the room, okay, who here in this
3002720	3008720	room has less than a million and still feels they have everything they need, and then all those hands
3008720	3014560	go up. I just think we don't need, I mean, also you should know, if you just look at the data,
3014560	3021520	the vast majority of people do not have so much money. So it is just this fixation with always
3021520	3026800	having more and more and more that has become this almost like ideological thing that has spread
3026800	3032800	throughout the world. And I think we should get that back into the bottle. The argument that
3032800	3037680	you're making, I'm imagining you arguing with a billionaire, right, who says, well, hold on a
3037680	3043680	second, you can't do this, I need this money. And then you're like, okay, who here is happy
3043760	3047760	with their, you know, much less than a billion dollars and thinks they have everything that they
3047760	3052560	need in the world. And 99% of the hands go up. And then you go back to this billionaire, okay,
3052560	3058640	why do you need the money? Like, what do you, what do you need it for? Like, what is it, what is it
3058640	3066160	for other than, you know, building monuments to yourself, you know, donating to your favorite
3066160	3070080	causes. Okay, that's fine. But everyone has a favorite cause. Why should you get to choose
3070080	3074080	your favorite cause versus anybody else? It's a status and a power thing. It's really status and
3074080	3080000	power. And that is really where I think, okay, status and power, there are many, there are
3080000	3086640	different ways in which we can try to acquire status and power. But the problem with money is that if
3086640	3091120	money becomes a thing by which you try to acquire status and power, it harms the rest of us.
3092160	3097760	Because of the reasons we discussed and also because it deprives money to the government
3097760	3102880	who needs that money to alleviate poverty, to build roads and all that other stuff.
3103440	3107840	You can also have, you can also have status and power with 10 million dollars. You don't
3107840	3113200	need a billion dollars to do it. I agree. I agree. Like, you know, I'm lucky enough that
3113200	3118480	I've been able to donate to a local politician who I care about well enough that I get to go to a
3118480	3122320	little event and shake their hand, you know, and they say thank you. That makes me feel good and
3122320	3126560	also it's someone I believe in. And it's within, you know, it's like a, it's a legal limit, right?
3126560	3133120	It's like, it's like 800 dollars here in LA. And you know what? That's, that's plenty. You know what
3133120	3137280	I mean? Get to feel a little bit special, get to help out. I could donate more than that to a local
3137280	3141200	nonprofit and then, you know, maybe they put my name in the newsletter or whatever it is.
3141920	3147120	That's a, that's a healthy version of this dynamic that people want. It's when you,
3147680	3153680	it's when you inflate it to the, the 100 million or the billion level that it becomes toxic, that,
3153680	3158720	that no one needs quite that much data. Exactly. So the, the funny thing is that,
3158720	3163280	that with, with donations and philanthropy. So I have a chapter in the book that's called
3166160	3171760	now I forgot the title. It's something like, oh yes, it is philanthropy is not the solution.
3171760	3178320	That's the title of that chapter. And, and the problem. And so basically it, the, there's something
3178320	3183520	paradoxical almost that I do in that chapter, because on the one hand I argue that I think
3183600	3188240	all of us should really consider whether we may have too much because we have, for example,
3189520	3194560	I mean, say upper middle class people who just were lucky in the, what, because their houses,
3195200	3201520	they bought the house in say the nineties for just very little money. And then the housing,
3201520	3206880	there was a boom in housing prices and now they're old and they're sitting on this house that is
3206880	3213360	worth more than a million. Well, I think should they give a million to their kids? I'm not sure.
3214240	3220720	Um, so, um, and, or there couldn't be other reasons. So I think the question, do I have,
3220720	3225680	can I give more is a question that I think many more people can ask themselves and only those
3225680	3230640	that have more than, than a million or 10 million. Yeah. So that is where I think actually giving is
3230640	3237840	a good thing. But the problem is, uh, when the giving comes with power, then it's problematic.
3237920	3243840	So I think small money donations, small money philanthropy, what everybody can do is very good
3243840	3250720	because it doesn't have any power. But as soon as the donations really entail a form of power,
3251520	3256960	or are really wasteful, um, and actually sometimes philanthropy, I mean, you've had an,
3256960	3262800	an, uh, a whole, uh, episode on this, but philanthropy is also a way to really, uh,
3262800	3266960	engage in tax avoidance and tax evasion. So there, there's also really dirty forms of
3266960	3270640	philanthropy. Uh, that's what you should try to avoid. Power hoarding. People,
3270640	3276240	people build power for themselves via philanthropy, uh, you know, through family foundations. Uh,
3276240	3278960	you can't donate the money to your kids without paying a lot of taxes. Instead,
3278960	3283200	you create a foundation and give that to your kids. And now your kids wield political power
3283200	3288240	because they're distributing billions of dollars or, or millions of dollars for the rest of their
3288240	3292480	lives. The, um, the, the Patagonia founder did this to much greater claim. And I made a video
3292480	3296720	that was very critical of him for essentially hoarding that kind of political power for his
3296720	3303680	family. Um, I mean, this is such a radical proposal. I'm, I'm curious, and I love that you say
3303680	3309600	the American call that only the far left has in the United States to ban billionaires, right?
3309600	3314960	You'll hear Bernie Sanders, who's on the left of our acceptable, you know, political Overton
3314960	3318800	window, um, in American politics. We'll say there should be no such thing as billionaires,
3318800	3322080	a couple other people as well. That's already a fringe position. You say that doesn't even go
3322080	3328560	far enough and that we need to ban 100 millionaires, sent to millionaires. Um, yes. So what would
3328560	3335600	society look like? Were we to do so? Can you paint us a little bit of a picture of, you know,
3335600	3341040	it's, it's almost like an Ursula K. Le Guin novel. Like what is this? What is this fantastical world
3341040	3345760	that you're describing? But I'd love to hear a little bit about it. Yeah. So I mean, I, I really
3345760	3350640	think that should be the next book, right? And it's also the last chapter I say, okay, what does this
3350640	3356560	now demand? It demands a different way of organizing the society. I don't know exactly
3356560	3362720	how this would look like, but what I think we should do is, um, to, so we had in the, in the
3362720	3370320	post-war years, so the fifties and the sixties, we had a much better mix of what the government did
3370320	3375600	for us, not just for capital, but for us, for ordinary people. And then the entrepreneurs
3375600	3381600	that also saw themselves really much more as stewards towards the communities. And we had,
3382480	3387280	so we had a mix of different things. And also the, the government actually was much more,
3387280	3392400	a much more important force for innovation. The self governments in those years were very
3392400	3396960	important for innovations that actually are now part of what makes the billionaires billionaires.
3396960	3402960	So there's something deeply ironic there. And that economy, which I, when I studied economics,
3402960	3407520	was told is called the mixed economy. I think we should have the mixed economy,
3407520	3412800	but we will have it with all the technological advances that we currently have. So basically,
3412800	3418160	it's really, uh, and then it should, of course, be in a way that keeps also the economy and the
3418160	3424000	way we produce stuff within planetary boundaries. Now, if you ask me what, how does it look like?
3424000	3429200	There are people who are doing research on this. So for example, in the UK, you have, um, Kate
3429200	3434720	Rayward, who's argued for the donut economy, donut in the, which is the metaphor for you
3434720	3440240	stay within the planetary boundaries. You don't, um, what we are currently doing, we're basically,
3441440	3447200	overusing the planet. It's not, we're going to be to the same degree habitable for our children
3447200	3452720	and grandchildren. And you also try to make sure that everybody has their minimum social needs met.
3453440	3461840	And, uh, I think such a world is possible, but it requires, I guess it requires not just, uh,
3461840	3466240	much better international cooperation, but also really a different ideology.
3467520	3474320	I think the, the, the, the feasibility problem in terms of, say, getting it organized is not
3474320	3479840	a question. The question is, do we want this? Yeah. And, and there, I think the U S really is
3479840	3486800	again in a, in a very particular position because, uh, not only because the ideology of, I mean,
3486800	3491760	what we tend to call the neoliberal ideology is so much stronger in the U S than it is, for example,
3491760	3500080	in, in, uh, continental Europe, but also because the U S is so, so rich. So I'll just give you one.
3500080	3505920	So there is an online publication, the global wealth report, which has zillions of data that
3505920	3510720	where you can learn everything about wealth distribution. But let me just give you one,
3510720	3518640	one statistic, which is what is the share of wealth, total wealth that, that the U S has
3518640	3524320	of all the wealth that is in the world. So we know that America has about 4.2% of the global
3524320	3532080	population. So if, if America had as much as other countries, it would have 4.2% of wealth.
3532160	3535840	Yeah. How much do we actually have? I'm afraid to hear the number.
3536480	3545360	30.8%. 30.8%. Yes. So, and also if you look at all the other statistics in that report, like
3545360	3551360	the number of ultra wealth, what, what financial people call ultra wealth, ultra wealthy people
3551360	3558000	and the number of billionaires, all that money, the most of the money really in the world is in
3558000	3563840	the U S. I mean, I, yes, it's true. China is growing. You have billionaires in all countries.
3564720	3569520	And that means that if you get, if you get, if somehow, and this is really the big question,
3569520	3577120	how, if we were able to get this change in the U S, then the other countries can follow.
3577120	3579920	But I think if, if we can't, yeah, so I think really.
3579920	3583840	And yet, but this is probably the hardest place to make it happen because this is where
3583840	3587040	we've got all the rich people and they have all the power and they're running the country.
3587040	3592000	Right. Yeah. And so then, so this is really the question like how to change this. And this is now
3592000	3600240	where the, where the, it's almost so sad that you, that we have to start making jokes about it. But
3600240	3605520	I think the only solution really is democracy. Yeah. But then, then we're talking about American
3605520	3611520	democracy, right? Right. Yeah. In the election year. So, but I just think the, the only solution
3611520	3617840	really is for, to have a mass mobilization and make people understand what's genuine in their
3617840	3624720	interest and not what they should just believe that politicians are saying. And the problem also,
3624720	3632320	of course, which scholars have documented in detail is that the, the more you could say leftist
3632320	3640000	leaders say the Democrats in, in the U S or labor in, in the UK or social democratic parties in,
3640000	3646320	in continental Europe, they have all really also adopted that neoliberal strategy. They have
3646320	3651280	led ordinary people down. And that means, of course, that now we have a crisis of democracy.
3652240	3658160	So we are, we are in a very, very bad situation. So thank goodness we have comedians who make us
3658160	3665920	laugh once in a while so that we can keep going. Yeah. Gallo's humor is what this show specializes
3665920	3674800	in as we're on our way to the death of democracy. When you describe this, describe this position
3674800	3682080	as libertarianism, do you think it's compatible at all with capitalism as an economic system?
3682080	3686960	Or is it, you know, is this a form of socialism? We don't need to get too deep into the classification
3686960	3692000	of these things. But I'm curious if you, if you think it's, if it's compatible with capitalism
3692000	3697680	at all? Yeah. So if the economic system that we had after the world war, so this mixed system of,
3699200	3706160	of having, I mean, so I think what people would generally label social democracy, if
3706160	3711920	social democracy is seen as a form of capitalism, which I would say it is a form of capitalism,
3711920	3719120	but kind of a good form of capitalism, then the answer is yes. A better form. Yeah. Yeah. But
3719120	3725040	the thing is that I know we can get stuck into definitions, but if of course the ultimate thing
3725040	3732640	of capitalism is unconstrained profit seeking, then the answer is no. I mean, I think profit is,
3732640	3737440	I mean, sort of the defenders of capitalism will say that profit is a force for goods,
3737440	3741680	because it will make sure that I as an entrepreneur will deliver something that meets the need of
3741680	3746960	another person. And I do this because I seek a profit and they get their desires or their needs
3746960	3754320	met. So that's the magic, but that's the magic of markets. And I think, so the question is just,
3754320	3762000	can we have this system where we are satisfied with decent profits, good profits, but not boundless
3762000	3767360	profits? If the answer is yes, then we can have capitalism. If the answer is no, then I don't
3767360	3770400	know what we're going to have. So some people think we're going to have the pitchforks.
3771440	3776320	I want you to address someone like Jeff Bezos directly to end the episode,
3776320	3781120	because if I'm imagining, I'm going to put myself in his position, right? And what I think he actually
3781120	3788080	believes. And I think what he believes is, yes, I have amassed great wealth. I have done so by
3788080	3793680	creating more wealth for everybody else. I created this gigantic company. I grew it. I grew it.
3793680	3798880	So many people have made so much money from, you know, the people who sell products on my
3798880	3803760	platform to the guys who drive the trucks, even the warehouse workers, oh, they weren't doing,
3803760	3806800	you know, that part of the country, they didn't have that many good jobs and we've given them
3806800	3811360	jobs and, you know, they've made some money where they couldn't make some before. And the reason I
3811360	3818160	have so much is because I have been an engine for so many other people getting so much as well.
3818160	3823040	And so if you stop people like me from existing, everybody will in fact be poorer. I think that's
3823040	3827040	what they genuinely believe because everyone believes they're a good person and everyone
3827040	3831840	has a justification for why that's the case. And so if you could sit him down,
3832160	3837760	what would you tell him about why he is wrong about that and what would in fact be better?
3838480	3843120	Yeah. So I'm serious when I say, if people like Jeff Bezos want to have a chat with me,
3843120	3849920	they can Google me, they can call me and I talk with everybody. But what I would say to him,
3849920	3857520	if I were to meet him, is that no money, no wealth is created by, can be created by a person that
3857520	3862960	by themselves. So I mean, I have in the book this example of take somebody like Jeff Bezos and
3862960	3868320	some of his friends and put them to an island where which has enough to survive and let's see
3868320	3873760	how rich they can become. They cannot become rich. That means all wealth in the virtual world is
3873760	3880080	because of collaborations within society. And that means that so that if he says I create these jobs
3880080	3885840	for all these people and I produce all these services, the question about distribution cannot
3885840	3892320	be avoided. You always have to ask, okay, we produce this together. So how much do I take
3892320	3897280	and how much do I give to the workers to be all the people in the supply chain. And that's where
3897280	3904000	it goes wrong. So he basically is giving them as little as he can to still be able to run his
3904000	3909280	company. And that's really, and that is, and if you then look at what he gives them also the
3909280	3913920	working conditions, I think it just meets the definition of exploitation. And it's actually
3913920	3920320	interesting that when his former wife, Mackenzie Scott, when they divorced and she got, I think,
3920320	3928560	one fourth, one quarter of his Amazon shares, she wrote this letter on Medium where she said
3928560	3932640	something like she announced that she was going to give away all our money. And then she said,
3932640	3939280	I do not doubt that the wealth that is in the hands of individuals is actually being created
3939280	3946240	by forces that provide countless opportunities for some and our obstacles to others. And I just
3946240	3954560	think we should stop thinking about, okay, what did I as an individual create? And we should see
3954560	3960080	it as, what do we create together? It's almost impossible to do something without others. And
3960080	3966320	if you do something with others, the question about how to divide up what you create together
3966320	3972240	hence the distributive question is just unavoidable. If you do not ask it, it is because you are in a
3972240	3976080	power position to dictate to the others what you take and what they will get.
3977600	3984560	That is a wonderful answer that, it's a flip to look at, oh, I've given these people so many jobs.
3984560	3990560	How about all those people with those jobs created all of the wealth and you are taking
3990560	3995200	an outsized portion of it? And in fact, if you did not take so much, they would be even wealthier.
3995840	3996800	Absolutely.
3996800	4003440	Is the question to ask. Well, I love that you're putting those ideas out there. And I know that,
4003440	4007360	I love that you said, how can we make them happen? And we have to think about it. It seems like an
4007360	4012080	obviously very long road, but never doubt the capacity of a book to change the world, right?
4012640	4018800	You know, Karl Marx did it, Adam Smith did it, right? And there it is. Yeah, hold it up one more
4018800	4020080	time for us so we can see.
4020080	4023200	Yes, and I actually, I should say something. So here's the book I wrote.
4023760	4031520	I should say something about the length that ideas can take. So the people who have influenced,
4031520	4037200	the thinkers who've influenced the current, our current ideology. So that's Frédéric von Hayek
4037200	4041920	and Milton Friedman and others, they wrote their books in the, they started to write their books
4041920	4050720	in the 40s. They seized power around 1980. So we are in there for the long run. This is not
4050720	4054880	going to be something that we're going to implement tomorrow. We have to start changing
4054880	4060320	the ideology because if you change, you can't change policies without changing the way people
4061360	4067920	see themselves, see society. So I think in this change of, in this, in this sequence of change,
4067920	4072240	the first thing that needs to change is the ideas. And that's where we are now.
4072800	4076160	And I'm not alone. There are many people who are writing books, producing movies.
4076640	4077120	Yes.
4077760	4081920	And that's where we need to do the hard work and just not give up.
4082560	4086560	Well, thank you so much for being on the show. You were absolutely wonderful to talk to. I
