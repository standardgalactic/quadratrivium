00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,120
You know, we all know that poverty is a bad thing and I think most of us agree

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,240
that the world would be a better place if poverty didn't exist or at least were greatly reduced.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,200
It's not just the human suffering that makes poverty bad. It's also bad for an entire society

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,600
if a large group of people can barely survive. That's why LBJ waged a war on poverty and in the

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,040
booming 1960s, the poverty rate indeed went down a huge 39%. But if we won a couple battles on

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,400
poverty back then, we have lost the war since. You know, we had a 13% poverty rate in 1980

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:48,320
and an 11.5% poverty rate in 2000. But that rate was basically the same last year, 23 years later.

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,320
And you know, we talked to some extent in this country about how poverty is bad. We should

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,320
talk about it more. But you know what we almost never discuss? How bad extreme wealth is. The

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,440
super wealthy are bad for our society. America has 800 billionaires. They're mainly men and it is

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,560
obviously bad that these people have so much money because just as being poor makes you less

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,080
likely to be able to participate in society as a citizen. Huge amounts of wealth give you a gross

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,520
and unfair amount of political power. And you know what? Since we live in a democracy, I think

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,000
that's a bad thing. You know, we're happy to have conversations about getting rid of poverty,

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,040
but why are we so much less comfortable talking about eradicating extreme wealth? Because if

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,640
extreme wealth is just as damaging to our society as poverty, why can't we imagine waging a war on

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,360
that too? It's not just a foregone conclusion that we live in a society where some people are

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,720
unelected god emperors with treasure palaces and apocalypse bunkers and unilateral control over

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,640
our political system. It is not right or natural that unearned hereditary wealth can be passed down

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,920
for centuries. Last time I checked, we had a couple revolutions to end that sort of thing and then

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,440
we were all taught in school that it's bad. So concentration of wealth and power is simply

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,640
undemocratic. And if you think democracy is the right system to decide how we run our society

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,560
collectively, well, I think you'd have to say that that concentration is bad. So what kind of

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,760
arguments can we actually make against the existence of the wealthy? What limits should

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,840
be placed on wealth and why? This is a radical conversation to have, but it gets less radical

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,400
the more you consider it. There's a name for the philosophical view that wealth should be

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,920
drastically limited. It's called libertarianism. And my guest today came up with this view and

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,000
has advanced the very best arguments for it. But before we get into the argument,

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,040
is the political philosopher Ingrid Robins. She holds the chair in ethics of institutions at the

36
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,640
Ethics Institute of Utrecht University and her new book is called Limiterianism, The Case Against

37
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,840
Extreme Wealth. Please welcome Ingrid Robins. Ingrid, thank you so much for being on the show with us

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,320
today. Thank you for having me. So tell me a little bit about your background, the work that you do

39
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,600
and why you have concluded that it is a bad thing for us to have billionaires striding around the

40
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,440
earth. Yes. So I'm actually going to argue that it's not just bad to have billionaires, but that

41
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,880
it's bad to have deca millionaires, people who have more than 10 million euros, pounds, dollars

42
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,720
in a context such as the Netherlands. But I'm sure we will get to that later. So I'm a professor

43
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,280
of political philosophy. I'm also trained as an economist and I have been working in my academic

44
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,640
research for the last 20 years on questions of inequality. And often when we think about inequality,

45
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,520
especially economists, they focus on the poor. They think we should solve poverty. But I think

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:16,240
we've now entered a phase in the history of human societies where we should also really

47
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,520
increasingly worry about wealth and wealth concentration. Of course, I'm not the first

48
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,400
to say this. I'm not the last to say this. But what I've tried to do is to write a book where

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,160
I focused on the moral arguments. Why shouldn't we have people that are too rich?

50
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,280
And so tell me what some of those arguments are. Why shouldn't we?

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,320
Yeah. So it's actually, I have a number of them. There are different types. One is that often the

52
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,160
money is earned in a way that makes it stained. So people should not have gotten it in the first

53
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,960
place. An important argument is that it's too much wealth harm societies, either because it

54
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,280
undermines democracy or because it's incompatible with principles of ecological sustainability.

55
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,480
And then there is the fundamental philosophical argument that I think nobody can say they deserve

56
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,760
to be super rich and deserve in a moral sense. And there's a final argument which

57
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,720
some people don't take too serious, which is that it's actually not good for the super rich

58
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:24,320
themselves because it doesn't make them happy. I'm sorry, that's the funniest argument. To go

59
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,560
up to Jeff Bezos and be like, yeah, dude, but you're sad. I saw you crying. You are not a happy man.

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,560
The thing is, there is actually some evidence that wealth accumulation works as an addiction.

61
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,880
So if we are worried as human beings, that our fellow human beings can be addicted to any type

62
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,960
of drugs, and we see that also in the brain accumulating money works in the same way,

63
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,480
then we should probably also feel some empathy for those who are just locked up in this,

64
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,520
not just desire, but this compulsion to just keep accumulating money. It does change the

65
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,320
character of the super rich. That is basically the argument. And let me put it politely, not

66
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,400
necessarily for the better. Yeah, it must be a compulsion to keep accumulating money because

67
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,120
there is a point, I think we know from social science, very soon where you earn a certain

68
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,680
amount of money and your happiness tops out. You don't get happier if you have $11 million

69
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,520
versus $10 million, but there is a compulsion to keep earning more and to keep growing and growing.

70
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,040
I feel it myself sometimes too when I'm making this podcast, I'm touring around doing stand-up

71
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,840
comedy, and then I'm spending my nights writing a new YouTube video because I want to get a couple

72
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,600
more views. And sometimes I go, wait, why am I doing this? Does it match my goals? And I look

73
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,240
through, yeah, I think it does right now, but it also might just be that compulsion to do more,

74
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,960
more, more all the time. And I could see that really, if you're a banker on Wall Street or

75
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,600
something like that, and your entire job is that number at the bottom of your spreadsheet,

76
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,200
there would be a compulsion to have more and more all the time, and there would be nothing else

77
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,640
behind it. Yeah, so talking about Wall Street, there was a Wall Street trader, I can't remember

78
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,680
the exact year, but I mean, about 10 years ago, who wrote a piece in the New York Times, and then

79
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,560
later also a book where he mentioned that he was a Wall Street trader, he had no kids, no philanthropic

80
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,960
goal to work for, no debts. And still he was angry because his annual bonus had only been like

81
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,320
3 million, and why wasn't it more? And then he realized this was really like an addiction he

82
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:42,400
had earlier, had some, some alcohol addiction, I think. And so that's really the idea of the

83
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:49,600
addiction is, it's not an idea, there is really some, some evidence in how it works. And there's

84
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,800
also an interesting little book written called The Psychology of Money by somebody who advises,

85
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,360
who's a financial advisor, who also says, the only way to really not start to do kind of crazy

86
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,880
things or criminal things or to let it take over your life is by just saying, okay, until here,

87
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,160
and not further. This is my goal. And then that's all I need. That's all I want. And it,

88
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,560
it, it liberates people to not want to want to have more. It gives peace of mind. But anyway,

89
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,600
I actually think this argument for the super rich themselves, I mentioned it as the last one,

90
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,800
because I think the really important ones are that it harms us and that it's undeserved. These

91
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,480
are the fundamental ones. Well, let's get to those first. I mean, that was a very good piece of

92
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,720
practical advice for Jeff Bezos, if he's listening to the show, set a limit, and then just

93
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:43,600
stop Jeff and get some sleep. But you can look at what his ex-wife did. I know. She's giving it

94
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:50,480
all away. And she's giving it away in a very interesting manner, because she, she's not like

95
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,760
deciding what the money must go to, but she's giving it to organizations who within themselves

96
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,080
take control and can decide what to do with it. Yeah. And we've talked about that in a, in a past

97
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,560
episode of the show on billionaire philanthropy and the problems with it. And she's perhaps doing,

98
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,120
there's still problems with philanthropy at that level, but she is sort of the least bad

99
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,720
someone is giving money away for that reason. If you want to commend that at all. Let's talk,

100
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,600
though, about this very enticing argument you make that no one deserves that amount of money.

101
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,760
You say no one can really argue that they deserve that amount of money. I have to say,

102
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,560
I live in the United States. I hear people make that argument every day. I mean, I've made,

103
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,720
every time I make a video about Elon Musk, people say, Oh, well, you know, why don't you have all

104
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,720
that money? It's because you suck. That's the only reason you don't have it. If you were as good

105
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,520
and smart and wonderful a person as Elon, you would have earned the money because he deserved it,

106
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,920
and you didn't. So what is your counter argument to that? Yeah. So, I mean, what you're just

107
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,440
describing is really the way this, I mean, I think the word we should really use is ideology,

108
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,920
this meritocrats, neoliberal ideology that, that puts always the focus on the individual

109
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,640
and thinks that the individual deserves something. And if they are economically successful, it's

110
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,680
because of their own something to do with themselves. If they're miserable, they can be blamed.

111
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,680
That kind of framework, that kind of ideology, which we have increasingly come to think

112
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,760
is not the only way to look at human beings. And actually, once upon a time, we looked

113
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,840
differently at human beings. This way of thinking has, has also not fallen from the sky. It has come

114
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,400
from a deliberate movement of first thinkers and then politicians who increasingly made us

115
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,040
think like this. So this is just by way of background. So what do I think is based on

116
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:49,120
what I've been reading in, in various types of scientific fields? What do I think is the real

117
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,360
way we should look at human beings? I think we should put luck central. And luck comes in different

118
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,080
forms. The first form is what you could call biological luck or the natural lottery. The

119
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,720
genes you have are not of your own choice. So you can't say I chose my genes. The credits for my

120
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:16,240
good genes are mine because you didn't choose your genes, your talents, your creativity. Also,

121
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,120
the stamina, are you able to work really hard? Are you able to, to do long days,

122
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,600
difference quite radically between people? There is only so much of this that can be really trained

123
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,600
and learned. It is also just kind of difference between people. And if you happen to have what we

124
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,960
philosophers call drone, a good, a good ticket from the natural lottery, you should count your

125
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,760
blessings rather than saying, look what a fantastic human person I am. So that is the first type of

126
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,560
luck. And the problem and why I focus on luck is because luck can never be the basis for dessert.

127
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,840
That is the fundamental equation in this argument that if you want to say that you deserve

128
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,040
something, you must always trace your achievement back to something for which you can take credit.

129
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,480
And you can't, by definition, take credit for luck. So the first type of luck is natural luck.

130
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,080
The second type is social luck. The parents you were born with, the social class, the city,

131
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,320
the country. If you're born in the US, your opportunities are vastly bigger than if you're

132
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,040
born in, say, Afghanistan. And we don't choose where we are born. We don't choose our parents,

133
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,680
which also means we don't choose our inheritance, if any, because that's also a type of luck.

134
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:38,080
And then the last type of luck is what economists call market luck. So if you have two entrepreneurs

135
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,840
who are equally willing to really go the extra mile, put in all the hours, take the risks,

136
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,520
then it can still be the case that one of them, because of the way markets work and they often

137
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:56,960
allocate the big prices to one winner, its winner takes all markets, that their luck also plays a

138
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:06,240
role. And while luck may only play a small role in deciding who takes the big price and who

139
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:15,520
basically disappears or takes a smaller role, say, as an artist, luck sometimes is really the

140
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:22,320
pivotal thing. So there is an interesting book written by an economist called Robert Frank,

141
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,240
an American economist. It's called Success and Luck. I think that's the title. And he explains

142
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,640
based on studies that, for example, if companies have to decide which CEO they need to hire,

143
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,360
all these CEOs are extremely talented, they're very skilled, they are experienced.

144
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,520
What then makes the difference? It's this tiny little bit of luck. So even though luck may not

145
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,000
play in absolute numbers, a very big role in deciding who becomes very wealthy and who doesn't,

146
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,640
it is the factor that makes a difference. So if we then embrace this view that luck plays

147
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,480
such a big role in our lives, then I think the right attitude, if we're economically successful,

148
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,400
if we become rich, is really to be generous towards those that were less lucky. And that,

149
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,160
I totally agree, is really fundamentally at odds with the prevailing view in society.

150
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,560
Yeah, with entrepreneurs so much of the time, it matters to be in the right place at the right

151
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,800
time that if you were selling masks or video conference software in early 2020,

152
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,560
something very lucky happened to you that March, that caused your business to skyrocket.

153
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,600
It wasn't because of your great intelligence, you didn't know what was going to happen, etc.

154
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,920
Or if you were, I don't know, making steel at the right time during World War II or whatever

155
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,160
it was, that these things happen that we can't take personal responsibility for.

156
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,640
I used to, one of the first philosophical questions I can remember asking myself as a child was,

157
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,760
why am I here in the United States? Why is my consciousness here in the United States?

158
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,000
And this body as opposed to any other. And it's still something that I find fundamentally

159
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,200
mysterious. The fact that there's many humans and I am but one of them and I happen to be this one,

160
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,240
and why am I not a different one? And it's a cosmic dice roll.

161
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:27,120
Yeah, absolutely. And once you start to really realize the enormous luck we have to be born in

162
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:34,480
a country where I feel still every day blessed that I'm also in a country, so I prefer countries that

163
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:42,560
have decent social security systems. I mean, decent welfare states also for the compatriots

164
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,640
that are less lucky, people who are disabled or who become unemployed or whatever.

165
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,880
Yeah, I still feel lucky that I happened to be here. I could also have been somewhere else.

166
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,880
And I think once you realize this, I mean, so it's really, so it's both like, how do we treat

167
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:07,360
each other? How do we allocate kind of, yeah, not just financial rewards, but also, I guess,

168
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,760
empathy to other people because it's not just this works, not just towards those that are

169
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,760
extremely successful. I think we should still congratulate people. So you can congratulate

170
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:24,640
me with my book. I will take the congratulations. I can congratulate you with your show. I still,

171
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,600
all of that is fine because in the end, we do, we do put in an effort and it would be kind of

172
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,440
strange to treat each other as determinist robots. That's not what I'm arguing for,

173
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,480
but I still kind of a bit of modesty would really, I think, change the way we

174
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,560
are generous or not, but also the way we organize society.

175
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,520
Yeah. Well, let's talk about some of the other reasons for that humility in a little bit, but I

176
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:59,280
want to get to first what I think is your main argument, which is that billionaires and people

177
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,880
who are overdecor millionaires are bad for the rest of society, that this sort of concentration

178
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,680
is a bad thing in and of itself, even if one were to think one deserves it.

179
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,280
It's even if a very deserving billionaire were to exist and we're all to say, yes,

180
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,440
very good job. We have no problems with how you did it and with you having this money,

181
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,320
that would still be bad. And tell me why you think that is.

182
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,560
Yeah. So I think the case of how well concentration undermines democracy,

183
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,320
so the principle of political equality is the clearest and especially in the US.

184
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:40,160
I mean, American political scientists have written papers and books where they argue that

185
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,720
the US is actually no longer a democracy, but an oligarchy or plutocracy because of the way

186
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,080
money influences politics. And money can influence politics in different ways.

187
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,360
The most obvious is donations, donations to political parties or to candidates.

188
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,440
And I mean, that is, I think, a significant difference between the US and Europe because

189
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,600
we have quite strict rulings on how much you can donate to a political candidate.

190
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:17,440
Actually, in my country, in the Netherlands, the last government made that rule even more

191
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,360
stricter. They decided that each person can give a maximum of 100,000 euros per person

192
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,200
per year to politics. Of course, those who want to really have a bigger influence on politics

193
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,920
will still try to find a way around, but it's difficult. And also, all the donations to political

194
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,200
parties are in an open register, so everybody can see what happens.

195
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,040
In the US, as you know, much better than I do. I mean, money can really buy politics quite

196
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,680
significantly. And it's also quite difficult to stand for political office if you don't have what

197
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:59,280
they call a war chest. So that is unfortunately the reality. So that's one... And then what political

198
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:06,400
scientists have shown is that the policies that follow are really skewed towards the interests

199
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,560
of the rich. And that is the first problem. The second problem is... Or the second mechanism

200
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,720
in which this happens is... Let me just dwell on the first problem a little bit, if that's okay.

201
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:24,160
That... I think we sort of don't talk enough about what we mean by democracy and political

202
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,320
equality, which is that it's the ability of average people to have a say in how the country

203
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,200
is run and for there to be some level of equality there. And if a small number of people have a

204
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,280
vast amount more power than everybody else, that's a major step back towards a monarchy or

205
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,600
towards a aristocracy where a small number of people are literally running the society that

206
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,800
we live in. And it's one of those things where I was like, oh, I was just brought up being told

207
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,200
that's what the American Revolution was about. That's not American values is for a small number

208
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,000
of people to lord over the rest of us. But that's what inevitably happens when there's too much

209
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,720
concentrated wealth. Yes. And I really think it is... I mean, the book that I wrote, when I

210
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,680
talk about it in continental Europe, I often get the reaction, yeah, yeah, but you know, this is

211
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,120
really an American problem, what you're describing. And it's not true. I mean, I have also lots of

212
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,800
scientific studies that show and also arguments that show that some of the problems are also really

213
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,400
universal problems and they play in Europe too. But the problem about how money translates,

214
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,880
so basically financial power, translating political power, is everywhere. But it's

215
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,560
especially, I think, a problem in the US because the walls that you have to build between the sphere

216
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:54,240
of money and the sphere of politics in the US are, they're very weak. Yeah. Also because, I mean,

217
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,320
if you say that companies that give money is a form of speech, yeah, then of course, I mean,

218
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:09,920
what is this kind of reasoning? And that is, I guess, a very specific problem for the US.

219
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,720
It's funny that you mentioned monarchies because I've lived all my life in monarchies,

220
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,920
first in Belgium and then in the Netherlands. But you know, our monarchs have like almost no power.

221
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,440
Yeah. In Belgium, they say that actually the monarch keeps the country together.

222
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,560
That's the main role they play. They're kept in such a little box. I mean,

223
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,600
I knew some people who are a little mad about all the gossip about the British royal family.

224
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,440
And I'm like, that is all they're for at this point. They're just there for everyone else

225
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,640
to gossip about. This is the only purpose. They have no other role. Yeah, they play different

226
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,520
role. They have in any case very little political power. I think the question you asked about what

227
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,040
is democracy really is a fundamental one. So it is not just having the right to vote.

228
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:05,840
It's also being able to vote. So for example, not having you be hindered from voting. It's also,

229
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:13,280
I mean, all the other factors that can prevent people from voting, but also political participation.

230
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,320
In the end, the ideal democracy, which will of course, which is an ideal, so we will never be

231
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:25,760
able to fully reach that is that we govern ourselves together. That means that everybody who wants to

232
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,760
and has an interest has an equal potential influence on society. And we are very far from this.

233
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:39,040
And the influence of the disproportionate influence of the very rich on politics

234
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,840
is not just directly via politics, but also for example, because of the way they influence the

235
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,520
public sphere. So if you have somebody like Rupert Murdoch, who just kind of buys up first in

236
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Australia, then in the UK and now in the US, who buys up media power and really becomes a very

237
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:06,320
important factor that shapes the public discourse, then you create, from money, you create power

238
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,440
that is a form of political power. Politics is not just about voting. I mean, this is an open door

239
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,040
we all know this, but we have to then really think like, what are the preconditions for robust

240
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:24,800
democracy? And I think that having, for example, also public institutions that are outside the sphere

241
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:31,280
of money, like have education outside, so no, to have basically high quality public education,

242
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:38,640
high quality public universities, high quality public media, these are all, I think,

243
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:45,280
very important to get a kind of political ecosystem that protects democracy. And the problem is that

244
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,800
money undermines this. There's a broader vision of democracy that I'm always trying to promote on

245
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,920
this show, which is because the one that we're brought up with is so limited to you vote, you

246
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,440
donate, maybe you protest and hold a sign, that's it. And that's all democracy is. But no, democracy

247
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,840
is having participation in all of how your society is run and making sure that it reflects the will

248
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,160
of all of the people. And that includes things like media or the conditions under which you work

249
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,600
or the town that you live in. So if a billionaire is so powerful that they can buy an entire

250
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,680
communications media and start bending it to their will, like Elon Musk did with Twitter,

251
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:30,640
or if a billionaire is so powerful that they can buy your entire town and control the

252
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,880
buildings that you live in, like, I forget the name of the guy, but the Warren Buffett's partner,

253
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,800
who's a billionaire, you know, designed his own dorm room for like a thousand students in, I believe

254
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,680
UC Berkeley, that's like a horrible jail. But he was able to do it because he had so much money,

255
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,280
he could donate and donate it and say, build a building like this, because it's my idea and

256
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,240
they're doing it. And it's going to be horrible. Everyone who lives there is going to be miserable.

257
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,600
But the only reason it happened is because this man had so much power, that kind of power over

258
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,120
the world, the rest of us live in is undemocratic, even when it doesn't touch our political system

259
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,880
properly conceived, you know, narrowly conceived. It's, it's, we don't want to live in a society

260
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,840
where one or two people are able to control the rest of us like that. That's not the fucking

261
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,520
point of this. Yeah. And there's actually two things that make it even worse. One is that once,

262
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:30,880
so often, the super rich, the multimillionaires, they also kind of, they used politics, then

263
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:38,720
basically politicians for their own purposes. So they, I mean, they, so Abigail Disney made

264
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:47,360
a film about her, her, the company of her, her grandfather. And she talks about the Disney

265
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:54,560
Park in, in, in California. In Anaheim. Yes, exactly. I was, I was trying to find a word.

266
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,240
Thanks for having me. I'm an expert in Southern California geography. If I have any questions

267
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,680
for you about Utrecht, you'll let me know. Yes, that's a good, that's a deal. So,

268
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,080
so she, and the movie is actually very, so it's a documentary, and it's very revealing because

269
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,080
it doesn't, it really shows how like they, they also, because they become so important and so

270
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,560
influential, the local government also just starts to do stuff for the company that makes

271
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,560
it even richer. Yes. And this mechanism where really you see the, I mean, I described in the book

272
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,960
a couple of really, really bad cases, like the kleptocrats, which we have in, I mean,

273
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,800
Putin is a good example, Berlusconi in Italy was a good example we had,

274
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:43,600
but you have them everywhere. And, and so it becomes really bad at all levels. So that's an

275
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:50,000
additional problem. But another problem is that the super rich, the billionaires, also no longer

276
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,840
become so rich that they kind of almost no longer need democracy. So we ordinary folks,

277
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,720
we need each other, we need each other to survive, to have good lives. But if you look at what people

278
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,200
like Peter Thiel does, so I don't know whether how much this has been discussed in the US, but

279
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,880
and I'm sure I don't know all the details myself, but he took on additional citizenship in New

280
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,600
Zealand, which is very, very difficult to get. The reason he could get it was because of some

281
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:28,080
contributions to the to the economy of New Zealand. And then he needed that because he wanted to buy

282
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,960
some unsupported lands. And that lands, which is close to a lake that is actually sacred for the

283
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,120
local indigenous people, the Maori, he can go there and live there with his friends when the

284
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,880
apocalypse hits US. And then you also, of course, have the super rich with their bunkers. So they

285
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,960
have all these strategies, I mean, Musk going to space is another example, rather than trying to fix

286
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,880
the problems that we have collectively on this planet. Yes, they have these escape fantasies.

287
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,520
But some of them, it's not just fantasies. I mean, if you, if you, if you have a private

288
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,440
jet or you have multiple private jets, and you just have bought a really nice piece of land in

289
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,640
New Zealand, and you just say, okay, when shit hits the fan, I just take my friends and we fly

290
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,560
there. Yeah. Well, this is a fantasy that so many people have. I think it's not just a fantasy of

291
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,600
the wealthy. The average people have the fantasy of I want a little compound out in the middle

292
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,040
of nowhere. I want to just, you know, have some goats and, you know, not need anyone and have a

293
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,920
safe place for me and my polycule or whatever it is, people want to, you know, get together.

294
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,920
But, you know, I think for average people, well, we can't really do it because we're so dependent

295
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:47,120
on others. Ultimately, at the end of the day, billionaires are able to live in the fantasy

296
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,280
world where their dependency on others is so abstracted away from them is so small, you know.

297
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:59,200
They don't see the, you know, Amazon factory workers, you know, making minimum wage, 12-hour

298
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,920
days, you know, peeing in bottles that they are actually dependent on for their wealth.

299
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,440
They have the ideology they did it themselves and that, you know, they can go sequester themselves

300
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,080
separately away from everyone. I'd like to get into the economic argument. What is bad about

301
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,920
having a small number of people with incredible concentrations of wealth for the economy and

302
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:29,040
for, you know, everyone else's earnings? Yes. So I actually don't, in my book, I don't spend a lot

303
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,280
of time talking about the economic argument because as a, as a philosopher, for me, the economy

304
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,400
is a means to enhance. And the answer is the things that are valuable. It is our well-being,

305
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,840
our flourishing, our freedoms, our possibility to shape the life, how we want it to have.

306
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,600
So the economy is a means to that. Still, I understand that you want to have a flourishing

307
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,880
economy because it really helps us to have these good lives. And so many people are actually

308
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:04,720
primarily moved by the economic arguments for limiting inequality. And the argument is that

309
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:12,400
increasingly the, the rhetorics that we've been told since the 80s, namely that if you allow

310
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:18,240
the rich to become as rich as they can and inequality is like a price to pay for them

311
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,880
becoming so rich, everybody will benefit. So that's trickle-down theory. Trickle-down theory is just

312
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,200
a piece of, a piece of theory. It's actually proven not to be true. Has that ever happened? I don't

313
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,720
think so. No, so the Australian economist, John Quiggin has a really nice term for this.

314
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,520
He calls them, he has written a book called Zombie Economics. And so basically he says

315
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,760
there's a couple of ideas. Actually, they're dead, but once in a while they keep coming back.

316
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,880
And of course, with trickle-down economics, we've seen in the UK that this trust,

317
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,640
who was the prime minister for what, like 80 days, that she really believed in trickle-down

318
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:08,400
economics. Trickle-down economics is kind of a, it's like a pretext to be able to let the rich

319
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:14,800
pay fewer taxes because we see that this doesn't work. If you want to grow the economy, you need

320
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:22,000
to invest in the human capital of everybody. That means make sure people are healthy, that the

321
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,960
communities are safe, and that they have good education and decent housing. And then you really

322
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,880
release the potential of people. And then of course, you need not too much bureaucracy and all that

323
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,640
kind of stuff. And that is, so that means that if you reduce inequality, it actually has a positive

324
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,280
effect on economic growth. And the opposite, so the idea that inequality is kind of the price to

325
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:55,360
pay for overall more economic growth, was the view that neoliberal economists have been pushing in

326
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:04,240
the 70s and the 80s. And that was standard, standardly believed to be true until, I don't know the

327
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,840
exact year, but at some point, some years ago, even the IMF, which is seen as the headquarters of

328
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,280
this kind of neoliberal thinking, at some point said, no, inequality can really become too big.

329
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,880
And then it just, independent of all the other factors, it hurts the economy. So there's even

330
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,600
no longer even a business case for inequality. There is however a case for those that are super

331
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,680
rich, because they can still become more richer and richer and richer.

332
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,440
Right. They can say, oh, it's working great for me. We can say, hey, we've been trying your strategy

333
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,960
of inequality fueling the economy for the past 50 years at least, doesn't seem like it's going

334
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,680
that great, right? Nobody thinks the world economy is in very healthy shape right now, nor has it

335
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:53,200
has, nor has it been since the 90s, I would say, that people were like, oh, things are going great.

336
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,760
And inequality has skyrocketed. It seems like these two things have gone together. And that,

337
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,640
might be time to try something new in terms of macroeconomics.

338
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:12,160
So I really think the problem is that we, and then when I say we, I mean ordinary folks,

339
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:19,920
we like not to talk about economics. We think economics is complicated. We think it's boring.

340
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:25,440
So we leave all of that to other people. And then of course, when politicians tell us something

341
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,960
about the economy, yeah, we have no idea what, so we basically believe them because they have

342
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,680
beautiful eyes or because we think they're a guy with whom we cannot go and have a beer at the

343
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:44,480
barbecue. You mean listen to the economists because they have beautiful eyes? I don't know what the

344
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:51,440
reason is, but I think we have, we should really empower ourselves in terms of economic literacy

345
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,440
so that we are able to really question what politicians are telling us when they propose

346
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,160
economic policies. Well, I've heard this argument and I actually would really like to get someone

347
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,600
on the show to dive into it. The argument that economics has been treated as perhaps too hard

348
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,960
of a science for the past few decades and that politicians will tend to listen to economists.

349
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,160
The economist says, blah, blah, blah. And so, oh, well, the economist said it. We must do it

350
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:22,160
without realizing that economics is a very interpretive field, that there's a lot of

351
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:29,040
ideology in it, and that we've been listening to a field that's been dominated by a certain

352
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,880
ideology of economics for a very long time without really questioning it, which is not the case in

353
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:42,480
sciences such as physics, climatology, et cetera. These are sciences that have a lot more objective

354
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,520
reality to it, but economics is a social science. And it's as though we were all listening to Freudian

355
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,000
psychoanalysts as though they were telling us the truth. Well, there's a lot of truth in it,

356
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,080
but we know that that's one school among many, and that's sort of the same thing that's happened

357
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,240
with economics. Yeah, no, that's absolutely true. Yeah, so basically, you hit the nail. Yeah, that's

358
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:09,920
just true. But I should also say, I think the politicians, when they talk about economics,

359
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,720
they really cherry pick what they like. And they also cherry pick, of course, the economists they

360
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:22,080
will put into their advisors, because economists, although I also really have a lot of criticism

361
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:28,320
on economics as an academic discipline, I also think, for example, economists have been arguing

362
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,440
for pricing the damage we do to the environment for as long as I can remember. I remember when I

363
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:42,000
was an economic student, and that's like more than 30 years ago, that we had a professor already

364
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,200
having a whole team of researchers talking about what economists then call internalizing

365
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,920
the negative externalities into the price. So basically, how can you make sure that if somebody

366
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,920
sells a product, that the harm to the environment is actually factored into the price so that

367
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,720
they will sell less and that there will be some compensation. And there you just see that we

368
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,760
are still ruining the environment. So I think it's a mixed thing about how much we should blame

369
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,080
economists as a profession. But I do think it's definitely the case that they have become very,

370
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:27,040
yeah, they've weeded out all the heterodox, what we tend to call heterodox schools. And they've also,

371
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,680
and then I'm talking really as somebody who first studied economics and then studied philosophy,

372
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:39,120
they have tried to pretend to be like physics. Some economic methodologies call this the physics

373
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:48,720
envy among economists. And there's papers written about this. But economics, because it's about

374
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,480
society ultimately, is also about what we owe to each other. And that is the core of

375
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,600
ethics and political philosophy. So you can't separate economics from normative questions,

376
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:08,160
what is good, what is desirable, what is better. And that for me is really where I like to make a

377
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,720
contribution. And economics is built on, it's a human thing, right? Money is something that humans

378
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:22,240
invented, right? I love the writer, Yvonne O'Hurrari, who I don't always agree with,

379
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,120
but has a wonderful argument about poverty is imaginary. We made it up. It's not a feature of

380
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,520
the natural universe. It's a human thing that we created that some people have a lot of money and

381
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,920
some people don't. And people tomorrow could decide to do something different and different rules

382
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,840
would apply. And that's a fundamental way that economics is different from physics, because

383
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,280
the same is not true. But this is, here, you're talking about poverty. I mean, this is really a

384
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,360
very, very interesting example of how economics is not just economics, but also economic policy

385
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:57,280
judgments are ideological, because one of the arguments that have been made in favor of capitalism

386
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,480
in the form that we have it is look at what capitalism did with the global poor. The number

387
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,640
of people living in absolute poverty has really plummeted. And it's true. And then people looking

388
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,600
at those data will say, yeah, capitalism, no other system has ever done this. So capitalism is the

389
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,880
best system we have for the poor. And that's where their argument ends. And then basically,

390
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,080
we have to start to ask questions. What is that poverty line? It turns out that poverty line is

391
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:32,960
$2.2 per chasing power parity per day. That means what you can buy with $2.2 in the US per day.

392
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:41,600
It's not what you can buy with $2.2 in Antananarivo or a Kabul or wherever. So that means that line

393
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,160
is way too low. So you should have, like, say $11. And then you still see that there are still many,

394
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,960
many people in poverty. But I think the much more fundamental question that economists

395
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,040
and politicians should ask themselves is, all right, it's true. The number of people that live

396
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:05,440
in absolute poverty has become much, much smaller. But what had been alternative scenarios that would

397
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,480
also have been economically feasible? And are there scenarios in which that number would have

398
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,520
gone down much more? And I think the answer is yes. Because if you look at what we created,

399
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,440
all of us together with the global economy over the last couple of decades, and if you look at

400
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,560
the absolute shares that went to the global north and then mainly to shareholders in the

401
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,960
global north and what went to the garment workers in the global south, we've given them breadcrumbs.

402
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,760
We have taken really the vast share for ourselves. And that means that everything in the end is also

403
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,160
a question about how do you distribute what you produce together. And that means that

404
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,520
it's true that poverty is in that sense, well, imaginary, I think, I don't know what

405
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,760
I would use that word, but it is to some extent what we choose, because we could have chosen for

406
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:08,480
a different division of the economic gains in which we would have much fewer people in poverty.

407
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,000
So people say, hey, look at this, a whole lot of people used to make $1 a day. Now they make $2

408
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,320
a day. Capitalism is a big success. They don't point out that a bunch of other people who used to,

409
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:26,400
I don't know, make $1 million, now make $10 million. And that's where most of the gains went.

410
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,880
And like, well, hey, those people who make $2 now, they could have had five or 10 or 20

411
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,240
under a different system. You're ignoring the fact that we still have kept most of it for ourselves.

412
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,200
Shout out to Clariton for supporting this episode and for providing us with samples.

413
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,440
You know, my ability to conduct interviews on this show pretty much depends on me being able

414
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,160
to have smooth conversations with guests. But let me tell you, if you're plagued by seasonal

415
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,720
allergies, as I often am, you know the struggle of trying to maintain your cool while you're

416
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,320
gunning for the world record in consecutive sneezes and your nose is running like your life

417
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,120
depends on it. Luckily for those of us who live with the symptoms of allergies, we can live Clariton

418
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,640
clear with Clariton D. This double action combination of prescription strength, allergy medicine,

419
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,680
and the best decongestant available, relief, sneezing, a runny nose, itchy and watery eyes,

420
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,880
and itchy nose and throat and sinus congestion and pressure with ease. So when allergy symptoms

421
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,520
stand in the way of me bringing you another episode of Factually, I look for relief with

422
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,960
Clariton D. And in as little as 30 minutes, I'm refreshed, I'm renewed, and I am no longer

423
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,320
desperately scrounging for tissues like some kind of old timey tissue prospector. So if you are ready

424
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,680

healthy. I hit the gym, I walk everywhere, I try to get fresh air and vitamin D whenever I can.

429
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,920
But living a healthy lifestyle doesn't end the moment I walk through the front door.

430
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,680
Everything that comes through the front door of your home reflects the type of lifestyle you're

431
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,040
trying to live. And that is why I find my groceries on Thrive Market. And this is true. Me and my

432
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,520
girlfriend have used Thrive Market for years before they even advertised on this show. They have

433
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,640
become our one stop shop for all of our grocery and household essentials. And the convenience of

434
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,760
ordering online and having everything swiftly delivered to our door is an absolute lifesaver

435
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,480
that is why we have used it for years. What I really appreciate about Thrive Market is their

436
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,960
commitment to offering top quality brands with the best ingredients and sourcing methods.

437
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,840
They've got these handy filters that help me tailor my shopping experience to fit my lifestyle.

438
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,400
So for instance, my girlfriend, she needs to eat gluten free. And that is a filter that we can set

439
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,800
so that we make sure everything that we buy has none of that pesky gluten in it. Whether I'm in

440
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,920
the mood for organic snacks, low sugar goodies, whatever it is, I can easily find what I need

441

451
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,240
I think though that we've gone too deep in this interview without getting to the most radical

452
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,920
party or argument because we've set the stage for it. As a result of all this, you argue that we

453
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,240
literally should not allow the ultra wealthy to be so wealthy that we should put a cap on the amount

454
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,720
that people can. Is it earn or is it the amount of wealth that they can have? What is it?

455
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:19,200
It's half its wealth. So it's what we have. But let me just give you a bit of context.

456
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:26,720
So I say that we should strive to have a world so it's an ideal. It's not something we're going

457
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,760
to implement like tomorrow. I say that we should strive to have a world in which nobody is super

458
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:41,760
rich. And I propose two caps. And one is the higher is what you could call the political

459
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,600
or the institutional. And we should reorganize society and the economy in such a way that we

460
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,320
keep inequality within bounds. Now then obviously the question is where do you put that cap?

461
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:59,280
And the exact answer should be something like it should be at a level where the damages

462
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,360
to the political system and to the environment of the super wealthy are minimized, but there's

463
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:12,080
still enough room to let people who are motivated by financial gain do their thing. So those who

464
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,080
really only will work because they want to become rich, they should have enough space.

465
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,640
And then that's basically the tradeoff that you try to make. We got to let those sickos cook.

466
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,400
They're so motivated by money. There's people who are born like that every day. We got to give them

467
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,280
something to do or they're going to go nuts. Yes, but the question is, so some people say to me,

468
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,640
oh, but actually there was a book review in The Economist that says, no, this is crazy because

469
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,760
if people do not know that they could become super, super, super rich, they will no longer become

470
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,400
entrepreneurs. And then my answer is, how? Why do you think this is the case? There's no evidence.

471
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,000
So I think if people could become very well off, they could become really rich, but not extremely

472
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,800
rich. I think they would still try to be successful entrepreneurs. So I think this is again a kind

473
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:09,920
of almost an exchange of rhetorics. But what you should then do is to organize society in such a

474
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:18,960
way that, of course, the taxation would be much more progressive, that there would be taxation on

475
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:26,480
capital gains and on income from entrepreneurship at the same level as on income from labor,

476
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,320
which we don't have now because now we tax labor much more than we tax capital.

477
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,280
And then if you ask what would be the number, I think it would also depend on how society looks

478
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:52,160
like. So the more you have in a society, public goods, a decent health care system, public education

479
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:58,640
and so forth, things outside of the sphere of the market and profit making capitalism,

480
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:06,640
the more you have those things, the lower that level can be. So I suggest, but this is really

481
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:13,040
like a ballpark figure and as a start for the debate on this, that in a country such as the one

482
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,800
as where I live, the Netherlands, where we do have a public pension system, all of us are entitled

483
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,240
to public pension, which is roughly around the poverty line. And then we try to save for having

484
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:31,360
additional pension. And we have high quality public education. And we have a health care system for

485
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:37,520
all, which is it's like not like the British system, which is completely public, it's a regulated

486
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:46,400
more mixed system. I say for a society like this, 10 million. I know in the US people would say 10

487
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,240
million, 10 million. That's not enough. I can't even, I can't even send my kid to private school

488
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,600
and like fuel my private jet for 10 million. Exactly, you know, we don't need private school.

489
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,480
So that is the thing, of course, that you could say, well, I mean, I don't mind if people say,

490
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,840
well, you know, in the US, perhaps in current circumstances, make it, I don't know, 20 or 50

491
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:16,400
or even if you want 100 million, but definitely not a billion. You don't need a billion. Nobody

492
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,600
needs a billion. So I think the idea that that you hear in American politics that we shouldn't

493
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:27,120
have any billionaires is just not ambitious enough. So that is the political limit. Wow.

494
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,080
And then there is a second limit, which is really just the answer to the question,

495
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:39,200
how much do I as an individual need? Yeah. And there I did some research together with

496
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:47,040
colleagues from economic sociology, and we asked representative survey, a sample of Dutch people

497
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:53,600
where they say, so we gave them descriptions of the material quality of life of imaginary families,

498
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:00,080
and we asked to give them a label. Is this person poor, reasonably well off, well off, very well

499
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:08,320
off, rich, so rich, nobody, the phrasing was, nobody needs so much money, this is too much.

500
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:16,480
And then so we increasingly made the descriptions more affluent, and we were able then to make an

501
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:23,440
estimate of where the Dutch would draw that line. And for a family of two parents, two children,

502
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:34,320
data for 2018, so that's pre-inflation, we found that they said that around 2.2 million euros,

503
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,720
people say, okay, now it's enough for this family. So I think I therefore say in the book,

504
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,680
I think if you have as an individual, if you have one million in a country such as the Netherlands,

505
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:50,320
I have to repeat this, you have enough. And I should say, I often give lectures to citizens

506
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:56,720
where I'm in a debate. And then I'm sometimes challenged that somebody says, but why a million,

507
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,720
why not much, isn't that too low? And then I just ask people in the room, okay, who here in this

508
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,720
room has less than a million and still feels they have everything they need, and then all those hands

509
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:14,560
go up. I just think we don't need, I mean, also you should know, if you just look at the data,

510
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:21,520
the vast majority of people do not have so much money. So it is just this fixation with always

511
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,800
having more and more and more that has become this almost like ideological thing that has spread

512
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:32,800
throughout the world. And I think we should get that back into the bottle. The argument that

513
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,680
you're making, I'm imagining you arguing with a billionaire, right, who says, well, hold on a

514
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,680
second, you can't do this, I need this money. And then you're like, okay, who here is happy

515
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,760
with their, you know, much less than a billion dollars and thinks they have everything that they

516
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,560
need in the world. And 99% of the hands go up. And then you go back to this billionaire, okay,

517
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:58,640
why do you need the money? Like, what do you, what do you need it for? Like, what is it, what is it

518
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:06,160
for other than, you know, building monuments to yourself, you know, donating to your favorite

519
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,080
causes. Okay, that's fine. But everyone has a favorite cause. Why should you get to choose

520
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,080
your favorite cause versus anybody else? It's a status and a power thing. It's really status and

521
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:20,000
power. And that is really where I think, okay, status and power, there are many, there are

522
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,640
different ways in which we can try to acquire status and power. But the problem with money is that if

523
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,120
money becomes a thing by which you try to acquire status and power, it harms the rest of us.

524
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,760
Because of the reasons we discussed and also because it deprives money to the government

525
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,880
who needs that money to alleviate poverty, to build roads and all that other stuff.

526
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,840
You can also have, you can also have status and power with 10 million dollars. You don't

527
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:53,200
need a billion dollars to do it. I agree. I agree. Like, you know, I'm lucky enough that

528
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,480
I've been able to donate to a local politician who I care about well enough that I get to go to a

529
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,320
little event and shake their hand, you know, and they say thank you. That makes me feel good and

530
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,560
also it's someone I believe in. And it's within, you know, it's like a, it's a legal limit, right?

531
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:13,120
It's like, it's like 800 dollars here in LA. And you know what? That's, that's plenty. You know what

532
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,280
I mean? Get to feel a little bit special, get to help out. I could donate more than that to a local

533
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,200
nonprofit and then, you know, maybe they put my name in the newsletter or whatever it is.

534
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,120
That's a, that's a healthy version of this dynamic that people want. It's when you,

535
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,680
it's when you inflate it to the, the 100 million or the billion level that it becomes toxic, that,

536
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,720
that no one needs quite that much data. Exactly. So the, the funny thing is that,

537
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,280
that with, with donations and philanthropy. So I have a chapter in the book that's called

538
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,760
now I forgot the title. It's something like, oh yes, it is philanthropy is not the solution.

539
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:58,320
That's the title of that chapter. And, and the problem. And so basically it, the, there's something

540
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:03,520
paradoxical almost that I do in that chapter, because on the one hand I argue that I think

541
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,240
all of us should really consider whether we may have too much because we have, for example,

542
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,560
I mean, say upper middle class people who just were lucky in the, what, because their houses,

543
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:21,520
they bought the house in say the nineties for just very little money. And then the housing,

544
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,880
there was a boom in housing prices and now they're old and they're sitting on this house that is

545
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:33,360
worth more than a million. Well, I think should they give a million to their kids? I'm not sure.

546
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,720
Um, so, um, and, or there couldn't be other reasons. So I think the question, do I have,

547
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,680
can I give more is a question that I think many more people can ask themselves and only those

548
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,640
that have more than, than a million or 10 million. Yeah. So that is where I think actually giving is

549
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:57,840
a good thing. But the problem is, uh, when the giving comes with power, then it's problematic.

550
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,840
So I think small money donations, small money philanthropy, what everybody can do is very good

551
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:10,720
because it doesn't have any power. But as soon as the donations really entail a form of power,

552
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,960
or are really wasteful, um, and actually sometimes philanthropy, I mean, you've had an,

553
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,800
an, uh, a whole, uh, episode on this, but philanthropy is also a way to really, uh,

554
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,960
engage in tax avoidance and tax evasion. So there, there's also really dirty forms of

555
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,640
philanthropy. Uh, that's what you should try to avoid. Power hoarding. People,

556
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:36,240
people build power for themselves via philanthropy, uh, you know, through family foundations. Uh,

557
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,960
you can't donate the money to your kids without paying a lot of taxes. Instead,

558
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,200
you create a foundation and give that to your kids. And now your kids wield political power

559
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,240
because they're distributing billions of dollars or, or millions of dollars for the rest of their

560
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,480
lives. The, um, the, the Patagonia founder did this to much greater claim. And I made a video

561
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,720
that was very critical of him for essentially hoarding that kind of political power for his

562
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:03,680
family. Um, I mean, this is such a radical proposal. I'm, I'm curious, and I love that you say

563
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:09,600
the American call that only the far left has in the United States to ban billionaires, right?

564
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,960
You'll hear Bernie Sanders, who's on the left of our acceptable, you know, political Overton

565
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,800
window, um, in American politics. We'll say there should be no such thing as billionaires,

566
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,080
a couple other people as well. That's already a fringe position. You say that doesn't even go

567
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:28,560
far enough and that we need to ban 100 millionaires, sent to millionaires. Um, yes. So what would

568
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:35,600
society look like? Were we to do so? Can you paint us a little bit of a picture of, you know,

569
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:41,040
it's, it's almost like an Ursula K. Le Guin novel. Like what is this? What is this fantastical world

570
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,760
that you're describing? But I'd love to hear a little bit about it. Yeah. So I mean, I, I really

571
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,640
think that should be the next book, right? And it's also the last chapter I say, okay, what does this

572
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:56,560
now demand? It demands a different way of organizing the society. I don't know exactly

573
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:02,720
how this would look like, but what I think we should do is, um, to, so we had in the, in the

574
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:10,320
post-war years, so the fifties and the sixties, we had a much better mix of what the government did

575
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,600
for us, not just for capital, but for us, for ordinary people. And then the entrepreneurs

576
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:21,600
that also saw themselves really much more as stewards towards the communities. And we had,

577
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,280
so we had a mix of different things. And also the, the government actually was much more,

578
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,400
a much more important force for innovation. The self governments in those years were very

579
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,960
important for innovations that actually are now part of what makes the billionaires billionaires.

580
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,960
So there's something deeply ironic there. And that economy, which I, when I studied economics,

581
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,520
was told is called the mixed economy. I think we should have the mixed economy,

582
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,800
but we will have it with all the technological advances that we currently have. So basically,

583
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:58,160
it's really, uh, and then it should, of course, be in a way that keeps also the economy and the

584
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:04,000
way we produce stuff within planetary boundaries. Now, if you ask me what, how does it look like?

585
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,200
There are people who are doing research on this. So for example, in the UK, you have, um, Kate

586
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:14,720
Rayward, who's argued for the donut economy, donut in the, which is the metaphor for you

587
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:20,240
stay within the planetary boundaries. You don't, um, what we are currently doing, we're basically,

588
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:27,200
overusing the planet. It's not, we're going to be to the same degree habitable for our children

589
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,720
and grandchildren. And you also try to make sure that everybody has their minimum social needs met.

590
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:41,840
And, uh, I think such a world is possible, but it requires, I guess it requires not just, uh,

591
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:46,240
much better international cooperation, but also really a different ideology.

592
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:54,320
I think the, the, the, the feasibility problem in terms of, say, getting it organized is not

593
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:59,840
a question. The question is, do we want this? Yeah. And, and there, I think the U S really is

594
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:06,800
again in a, in a very particular position because, uh, not only because the ideology of, I mean,

595
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,760
what we tend to call the neoliberal ideology is so much stronger in the U S than it is, for example,

596
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:20,080
in, in, uh, continental Europe, but also because the U S is so, so rich. So I'll just give you one.

597
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:25,920
So there is an online publication, the global wealth report, which has zillions of data that

598
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,720
where you can learn everything about wealth distribution. But let me just give you one,

599
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:38,640
one statistic, which is what is the share of wealth, total wealth that, that the U S has

600
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:44,320
of all the wealth that is in the world. So we know that America has about 4.2% of the global

601
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:52,080
population. So if, if America had as much as other countries, it would have 4.2% of wealth.

602
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,840
Yeah. How much do we actually have? I'm afraid to hear the number.

603
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:05,360
30.8%. 30.8%. Yes. So, and also if you look at all the other statistics in that report, like

604
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:11,360
the number of ultra wealth, what, what financial people call ultra wealth, ultra wealthy people

605
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:18,000
and the number of billionaires, all that money, the most of the money really in the world is in

606
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,840
the U S. I mean, I, yes, it's true. China is growing. You have billionaires in all countries.

607
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:29,520
And that means that if you get, if you get, if somehow, and this is really the big question,

608
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:37,120
how, if we were able to get this change in the U S, then the other countries can follow.

609
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,920
But I think if, if we can't, yeah, so I think really.

610
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,840
And yet, but this is probably the hardest place to make it happen because this is where

611
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,040
we've got all the rich people and they have all the power and they're running the country.

612
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:52,000
Right. Yeah. And so then, so this is really the question like how to change this. And this is now

613
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:00,240
where the, where the, it's almost so sad that you, that we have to start making jokes about it. But

614
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,520
I think the only solution really is democracy. Yeah. But then, then we're talking about American

615
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:11,520
democracy, right? Right. Yeah. In the election year. So, but I just think the, the only solution

616
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:17,840
really is for, to have a mass mobilization and make people understand what's genuine in their

617
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:24,720
interest and not what they should just believe that politicians are saying. And the problem also,

618
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:32,320
of course, which scholars have documented in detail is that the, the more you could say leftist

619
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:40,000
leaders say the Democrats in, in the U S or labor in, in the UK or social democratic parties in,

620
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,320
in continental Europe, they have all really also adopted that neoliberal strategy. They have

621
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:51,280
led ordinary people down. And that means, of course, that now we have a crisis of democracy.

622
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:58,160
So we are, we are in a very, very bad situation. So thank goodness we have comedians who make us

623
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:05,920
laugh once in a while so that we can keep going. Yeah. Gallo's humor is what this show specializes

624
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:14,800
in as we're on our way to the death of democracy. When you describe this, describe this position

625
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:22,080
as libertarianism, do you think it's compatible at all with capitalism as an economic system?

626
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:26,960
Or is it, you know, is this a form of socialism? We don't need to get too deep into the classification

627
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,000
of these things. But I'm curious if you, if you think it's, if it's compatible with capitalism

628
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,680
at all? Yeah. So if the economic system that we had after the world war, so this mixed system of,

629
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:46,160
of having, I mean, so I think what people would generally label social democracy, if

630
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:51,920
social democracy is seen as a form of capitalism, which I would say it is a form of capitalism,

631
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:59,120
but kind of a good form of capitalism, then the answer is yes. A better form. Yeah. Yeah. But

632
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:05,040
the thing is that I know we can get stuck into definitions, but if of course the ultimate thing

633
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:12,640
of capitalism is unconstrained profit seeking, then the answer is no. I mean, I think profit is,

634
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,440
I mean, sort of the defenders of capitalism will say that profit is a force for goods,

635
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,680
because it will make sure that I as an entrepreneur will deliver something that meets the need of

636
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:26,960
another person. And I do this because I seek a profit and they get their desires or their needs

637
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:34,320
met. So that's the magic, but that's the magic of markets. And I think, so the question is just,

638
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:42,000
can we have this system where we are satisfied with decent profits, good profits, but not boundless

639
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,360
profits? If the answer is yes, then we can have capitalism. If the answer is no, then I don't

640
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,400
know what we're going to have. So some people think we're going to have the pitchforks.

641
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,320
I want you to address someone like Jeff Bezos directly to end the episode,

642
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:01,120
because if I'm imagining, I'm going to put myself in his position, right? And what I think he actually

643
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:08,080
believes. And I think what he believes is, yes, I have amassed great wealth. I have done so by

644
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:13,680
creating more wealth for everybody else. I created this gigantic company. I grew it. I grew it.

645
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,880
So many people have made so much money from, you know, the people who sell products on my

646
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,760
platform to the guys who drive the trucks, even the warehouse workers, oh, they weren't doing,

647
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,800
you know, that part of the country, they didn't have that many good jobs and we've given them

648
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:31,360
jobs and, you know, they've made some money where they couldn't make some before. And the reason I

649
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:38,160
have so much is because I have been an engine for so many other people getting so much as well.

650
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:43,040
And so if you stop people like me from existing, everybody will in fact be poorer. I think that's

651
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:47,040
what they genuinely believe because everyone believes they're a good person and everyone

652
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:51,840
has a justification for why that's the case. And so if you could sit him down,

653
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,760
what would you tell him about why he is wrong about that and what would in fact be better?

654
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,120
Yeah. So I'm serious when I say, if people like Jeff Bezos want to have a chat with me,

655
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:09,920
they can Google me, they can call me and I talk with everybody. But what I would say to him,

656
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:17,520
if I were to meet him, is that no money, no wealth is created by, can be created by a person that

657
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,960
by themselves. So I mean, I have in the book this example of take somebody like Jeff Bezos and

658
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:28,320
some of his friends and put them to an island where which has enough to survive and let's see

659
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:33,760
how rich they can become. They cannot become rich. That means all wealth in the virtual world is

660
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:40,080
because of collaborations within society. And that means that so that if he says I create these jobs

661
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:45,840
for all these people and I produce all these services, the question about distribution cannot

662
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:52,320
be avoided. You always have to ask, okay, we produce this together. So how much do I take

663
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:57,280
and how much do I give to the workers to be all the people in the supply chain. And that's where

664
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:04,000
it goes wrong. So he basically is giving them as little as he can to still be able to run his

665
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,280
company. And that's really, and that is, and if you then look at what he gives them also the

666
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,920
working conditions, I think it just meets the definition of exploitation. And it's actually

667
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:20,320
interesting that when his former wife, Mackenzie Scott, when they divorced and she got, I think,

668
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:28,560
one fourth, one quarter of his Amazon shares, she wrote this letter on Medium where she said

669
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,640
something like she announced that she was going to give away all our money. And then she said,

670
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:39,280
I do not doubt that the wealth that is in the hands of individuals is actually being created

671
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:46,240
by forces that provide countless opportunities for some and our obstacles to others. And I just

672
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:54,560
think we should stop thinking about, okay, what did I as an individual create? And we should see

673
01:05:54,560 --> 01:06:00,080
it as, what do we create together? It's almost impossible to do something without others. And

674
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:06,320
if you do something with others, the question about how to divide up what you create together

675
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:12,240
hence the distributive question is just unavoidable. If you do not ask it, it is because you are in a

676
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,080
power position to dictate to the others what you take and what they will get.

677
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:24,560
That is a wonderful answer that, it's a flip to look at, oh, I've given these people so many jobs.

678
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:30,560
How about all those people with those jobs created all of the wealth and you are taking

679
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:35,200
an outsized portion of it? And in fact, if you did not take so much, they would be even wealthier.

680
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,800
Absolutely.

681
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:43,440
Is the question to ask. Well, I love that you're putting those ideas out there. And I know that,

682
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,360
I love that you said, how can we make them happen? And we have to think about it. It seems like an

683
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:52,080
obviously very long road, but never doubt the capacity of a book to change the world, right?

684
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:58,800
You know, Karl Marx did it, Adam Smith did it, right? And there it is. Yeah, hold it up one more

685
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,080
time for us so we can see.

686
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:03,200
Yes, and I actually, I should say something. So here's the book I wrote.

687
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:11,520
I should say something about the length that ideas can take. So the people who have influenced,

688
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:17,200
the thinkers who've influenced the current, our current ideology. So that's Frédéric von Hayek

689
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,920
and Milton Friedman and others, they wrote their books in the, they started to write their books

690
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:30,720
in the 40s. They seized power around 1980. So we are in there for the long run. This is not

691
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,880
going to be something that we're going to implement tomorrow. We have to start changing

692
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:40,320
the ideology because if you change, you can't change policies without changing the way people

693
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:47,920
see themselves, see society. So I think in this change of, in this, in this sequence of change,

694
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,240
the first thing that needs to change is the ideas. And that's where we are now.

695
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,160
And I'm not alone. There are many people who are writing books, producing movies.

696
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,120
Yes.

697
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,920
And that's where we need to do the hard work and just not give up.

698
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,560
Well, thank you so much for being on the show. You were absolutely wonderful to talk to. I

699
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:10,880
couldn't have loved it more. People should pick up a copy of the book. It's called Limiterianism.

700
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,760
You can pick up a copy at our special bookshop, factuallypod.com, slash books. Where else can

701
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,680
people find it and where can they follow your working grid?

702
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:23,280
I would say if you want to buy a book, go to your local bookshop and they can order it for you.

703
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:28,960
And if you, I mean, yeah, people can, I have a unique name, my surname and my first name,

01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,040
Ingrid Robbins. There's only one person in the world. So if you Google me, you can find out what

705
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,920

706
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,760
conversation. You've been so wonderful, Ingrid. Thank you so much. Thank you.

707
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,960
Well, thank you once again to Ingrid Robbins for coming on the show. If you loved that conversation

708
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,600
as much as I did, pick up a copy of her book at factuallypod.com, slash books. And a reminder,

709
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,520
when you do so, you'll be supporting not just this show, but your local bookstore as well.
