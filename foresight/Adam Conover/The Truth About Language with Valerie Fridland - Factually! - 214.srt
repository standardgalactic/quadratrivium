00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello, and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me once again as

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,160
I talk to an incredible expert about all the amazing things that they know that I don't know

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,400
and that you might not know. Both of our minds are going to get blown together. We're going to have

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,360
so much fun. This week, we're talking about language. You know, people are constantly

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,480
arguing about what the right and wrong ways to use language are as though the rules of language

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,960
were encoded by some grammar god from on high. But they're not. Language isn't a set of objective

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,600
rules like math. No, language is created, changed, and used by people. And that means it will always

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,760
resist our attempts to control it. There was actually a funny example of this the other year in the

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,040
UK. A London primary school made a bold attempt to ban slang. And by bold, I mean pointless and

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,800
stupid. I mean, how are you going to stop teens from beginning sentences with because, like, or

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,720
basically this school even tried to ban phrases like he cut his eyes at me, which I mean, come on,

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,160
that's not just slang. That's poetry. That sounds like Shakespeare, man. And it's a phrase, along

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,440
with many others that were banned that originated among marginalized people. Controlling language

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,000
like this seems to be more about limiting the influence of certain people rather than the words

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,880
themselves. And at the end of the day, it won't work. Because again, language is created by people

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,920
and people are irrepressible. If you set up a linguistic rule, you would better believe some

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,560
enterprise and kid is going to come along and break it. And when they do, they are going to use that

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,000
new word phrase or sentence structure to mean something new, because that is what language

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
fucking does, bro. Now, none of that stops language from being a constant culture war target from the

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,400
battles over ebonics in the 1990s to conflicts today over the use of supposed woke language.

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,920
But those battles ignore something fundamental. The way people use language reveals something

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,120
about them, about who they are and where they come from and what is happening in their world.

23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,000
So instead of telling people not to use language a certain way, what if we took the opportunity

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,520
to learn from how they actually do use it? Well, fortunately for us, there is an entire field of

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,000
study that looks at the relationship between culture and language called sociolinguistics.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,680
And on the show today, we, in fact, have a sociolinguist who has written a fascinating new book

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,080
on this very topic. Her name is Valerie Friedland, and she's a professor at the University of Nevada,

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,640
Reno, and the author of a new book called Like Literally Dude, arguing for the good

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,800
in bad English. And you are going to love this interview with her. But before we get to it,

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,720
let's get to my interview with Valerie Friedland. Valerie, thank you so much for being on the show.

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,120
Absolutely. I'm excited to be here to talk with you.

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,800
So you're a sociolinguist. Tell me very briefly, what does that mean?

41
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,720
Well, first of all, I am impressed with how well you pronounce that. That trips a lot of people

42
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,840
up, which is part of the reason I went for that is my title. I love language. That's how I knew,

43
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,680
that's how I know how to pronounce everything. I love it.

44
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,440
Because I know the English language front to back.

45
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,480
I love it. All right. Well, we're going to test that as we go today.

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,080
Okay. I would love to.

47
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,480
I'm a linguist, a theoretical linguist, which means that I study the underlying structure of

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,160
language, how languages form in the brain, how your articulatory structure helps get language out.

49
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,200
But my particular interest is how social triggers and these underlying linguistic

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,840
tendencies interact and become language changes and evolve over time. So that's why I'm a sociolinguist.

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,880
And so give me an example of that. Like I'm sure your book is full of them, but give me an example

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,320
of how that social world will affect how language evolves.

53
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,560
Oh, absolutely. So I think a really seminal example is just looking at how

54
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,120
English has come to be the modern English we speak today versus being German

55
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,440
or something more like Icelandic, which hasn't changed much since its proto-Germanic days,

56
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,120
because we all started as a different language. But its social forces that came into the history

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,520
of English's development that changed it from a Germanic language, almost 100% Germanic word

58
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,280
stock to a language that has only about 30% Germanic word stock, because we had wars, we had

59
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,200
invasions, we had Vikings, we had all sorts of fun stuff. But we also had class and class plays

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,880
a huge role in shaping language. And during the middle English period, class was seminal

61
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,120
in forming the English that we speak today. So the lower class spoke English and the upper

62
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,480
class spoke French. And whenever you have unregulated language change going on without a lot

63
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,640
of upward pressure on keeping it standard or codifying it, natural evolutionary processes

64
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,120
in language, natural cognitive processes in language take place. And they meet with that

65
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,480
social trigger of social class and social standing. And that's really what formed the modern English

66
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,040
of today. So that's a really good example of how language triggers that are always there and social

67
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,760
triggers that come into play at certain times and places, interact and create something new and

68
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,560
novel. You know, an example of this interaction with a class that I heard, and I hesitate to

69
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,080
repeat it because I worry it's like a just so story that I heard, but maybe you can correct me

70
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,120
and tell me if it's real or not, is that the reason we have different words in English for or in

71
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,640
modern American English, at least, for the animal versus the meat that comes from the animal is

72
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,800
because of that class distinction that other languages, they use the same word or many others

73
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,960
they do. But in English cow versus beef, beef is French because it was the cow is the English

74
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,840
because it was the peasants who were dealing with the animal and the lords and ladies who

75
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,640
actually ate the meat. And so we ended up with this French descended word. That's a story I

76
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,720
heard many decades ago. Is that true? It seems to match the front line that you're talking about.

77
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,840
It is true. That's a great story. Actually, you can even read about it in Ivanhoe when they talk

78
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,840
about the peasants and what they called the food and the nobility and what they called the food.

79
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,880
It was very different because English had the words for the animal. So cow and swine, for example,

80
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,920
are the English words. But French was the language of nobility and it was the language of the upper

81
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,520
class at the time. And so the words that were used when you actually served as a servant, when you

82
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,160
served that animal, you used the French word. So cow became labouf. And that is exactly why we have

83
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,280
that two faced way to call animals and meat in English today. Well, now you mentioned the idea

84
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:01,120
that in the absence of a pressure to standardize the language, these evolutionary things will happen.

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,440
But that's also a big feature of languages, especially English. I grew up being told there's

86
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,400
a right way to speak and a wrong way to speak. I used to say, I'm doing good. And my friends would

87
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,840
say, Adam, Superman does good. You're doing well. And I was like, fuck off. You're being an asshole.

88
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:27,200
We're used to these sort of battles in English. And so in your view, very broadly, what role does

89
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,360
that those standardization forces play? I mean, is that a beneficial effect on languages? Is it

90
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
something that we should leave behind? It seems like a battle that never ends.

91
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,920
Well, I think it's actually a fairly new battle, which most people don't realize. What you're talking

92
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,520
about is prescriptivism. And we seem to think prescriptivism has been around forever because

93
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,080
we learned it. And we remember our parents saying, no, it's not him and you that went to the party.

94
00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:00,720
It's he and you that went to the party or he and I went to the party. But reality is that language

95
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,680
has evolved so much since the old English period precisely because there weren't a lot of

96
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,880
codification and standardizations that existed in the Middle English period to tell us how to speak.

97
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,800
And so it was natural evolutionary processes, natural trickulatory forces that led language to

98
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,080
where it is today. And it really wasn't until about the 18th century that we had people that were

99
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,240
like, wow, you know, I like the way I say this better than the way you say it. So let me write it

100
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,640
down. And now everybody's going to say it this way. So these prescriptivist tendencies, these

101
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,400
grammar books, these dictionaries really didn't start being written until about 1700. And that's

102
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,640
where we get this really strong complaint tradition. It's starting about that era where you don't do

103
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,280
it right, but I do it right. And you should do it like me. I think the big question is not whether

104
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,520
one opinion is right and one is wrong, but can they coexist? And we understand where these two

105
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,800
different beliefs about language stem from and what their purpose might be. So a prescriptivist

106
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,800
might say, you should say it this way, because first of all, that's how people in power say it.

107
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,600
And if you want to achieve that kind of economic or political power, you should say it this way

108
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,640
because that will get you in the door. They might also say that this is tradition and tradition

109
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,880
is valuable. So there is some benefit to that kind of speech. A descriptivist or someone who just

110
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,560
language naturally evolved might say, well, almost everything you say that you think is correct today

111
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,560
was wrong at some point in time and is an evolution from some previous point. And if we didn't allow

112
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,280
language to proceed naturally, then we would still have case markers in English. We would still have

113
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,680
grammatical gender in English. We would still have plural marking on every word in English.

114
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,240
We would have strong and weak verb classes, none of which do we have today. And our language is no

115
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,320
less for for for it. In fact, we are as expressive and creative and inventive as ever,

116
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,160
so that there's nothing wrong with natural evolutionary processes. And they're more

117
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,400
authentic to speakers personalities. My answer would be, I think both are right. There are times

118
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,960
in places where prescriptivism might fit. So for example, in writing, it's probably important to

119
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,480
have codification standardization. And even in more formal speaking contexts where I'm giving a

120
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,440
talk or I'm a CEO of a company and I am in a leadership position and I want to make sure

121
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,520
everybody understands me and that I'm a model in some way, that might be an appropriate place

122
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,320
for for prescriptivist notions. But if it's a teenager or somebody talking on the street or

123
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,720
my friend or my neighbor, then if they start using that kind of language, I actually think they're

124
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,600
an asshole. So it doesn't really serve. Yeah, if you're lecturing someone in person,

125
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,120
you're lecturing someone in person on the proper use of the semicolon and they're like,

126
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,360
dude, I was just fucking talking to you. Like I don't, I wasn't using semicolons. Like, well,

127
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,760
you actually raised a really good point that I didn't even think of because I often think of

128
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,640
prescriptivism as being simply wrong, that, you know, people claim that there's a right way to use

129
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,440
language and a wrong way to use language. And I think that's incorrect. I think that languages,

130
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,240
as you say, it's socially determined. And when someone says there's a right and way wrong way,

131
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,320
they're really making a statement about the about society, about, you know, people about the

132
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,480
I'm the right kind of person, and you are the wrong kind of person, and you should be more

133
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,880
like me, I'm standard, I'm normative, I'm dominant, I'm the I'm the rule, and you're the exception.

134
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,880
However, you do make a point that writing is very different from speech, that there are rules that

135
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,960
I do sort of believe are rules in, in writing about, I don't know, I think you need to close

136
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,080
the parentheses, you know, very basic stuff, punctuation marks and things like that. And,

137
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,880
and that made me just you saying that made me realize, oh, wow, yeah, writing just English

138
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,840
writing for someone else to read is far more rule bound than speeches and is actually a completely

139
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,760
different way of using language. They don't, they barely, if you were to write down what I'm

140
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,360
saying to you right now, it would be incoherent because I'm interrupting myself, I'm like inserting

141
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,440
clauses in the middle of sentences and then trailing off, they're completely different ways of using

142
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,040
language. And yet I understand every word that you said because in real speak context where we're

143
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,120
face to face or, you know, television screen to television screen, we, we have context and we

144
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,800
have background knowledge, we also can read other signs from our bodies, eye gaze, various things

145
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,960
like that that allow us to fill in those holes, but in writing, you're absolutely right, we don't

146
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,360
have that contextual information, and it wouldn't make sense. So we need more conventions in writing

147
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,480
than we need in speech. But I want to clarify that speech has a lot of rules. So I think a lot of

148
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,440
times people misconstrued what I'm saying to mean, okay, we don't have to have rules when we talk,

149
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,160
it's not important, because I absolutely agree with you that when we are judging someone on their

150
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,040
speech, because it's different from a prescriptive norm, we're just being prescriptive as assholes

151
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,720
who think we're right and they're not. And that's not an appropriate way to frame someone else's

152
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,880
speech. You can say, I don't like your speech, it's not my preference. But saying something is

153
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,520
disliked is very different than saying something is bad, which makes a moral judgment. And when

154
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm telling you that you're not good enough, because of the way your speech, your speeches,

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,560
I'm telling you that I'm morally judging you on the basis of something that's just different than

156
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,640
my own views and beliefs. But that doesn't mean that speech is not governed by rules. If we didn't

157
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,520
have rules governing speech, we wouldn't be able to understand each other. We have lots of rules

158
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,320
that govern speech. They're just not the type that appear in a grammar book or a dictionary.

159
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,440
They're the type that we know in here that we learn as babies, that we understand whenever we

160
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,160
have a conversation, no matter who we are and whether we're literate or not. So for example,

161
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,920
if I tell you, Ted thinks that John knows himself well. Well, who does the himself there refer to?

162
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,560
You know, it has to be John. It can't be Ted. Because of the rules that I understand as a

163
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,360
speaker of human language and a two year old, if you give them like two different puppets to

164
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:16,480
play with and to pick out, you say, Ted knows that John knows himself, and you name one puppet Ted

165
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,280
and the other puppet John, they will always pick the right puppet to refer to himself, because

166
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,920
that's an underlying rule of language that allows them to find the right antecedent. But these are

167
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,400
unspoken rules that we don't need someone to put in a dictionary. And if we did, we'd have to wait

168
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,280
till a kid could read, which would be way too late for language. So language is fundamentally a

169
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,880
different skill than writing, and we shouldn't expect the same rules to apply.

170
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Wow, that is so cool. And my mind is blown whenever I encounter a rule like that one that I learned

171
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,280
a couple of years ago, and you'll tell me the proper version of it. This will be my dumb dumb

172
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,640
recitation of it. But it's that there's a particular order of modifiers or adjectives in

173
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:03,280
English that if I were to say, you know, the big red scaly British dragon, right, those words all

174
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,960
come in a particular order. If I were to say the scaly red British big dragon, that immediately

175
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,400
sounds wrong to me, and it sounds wrong to you too. And there's like an order of, there's like

176
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,080
quantity, size, where it comes from, what its demeanor is, and those all come in a particular

177
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,440
order that I intuitively know, despite the fact I was never taught this in school. No one ever

178
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,280
sat me down and said, Hey, if you're going to apply eight modifiers in a row to a particular

179
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,320
noun, here's the order they have to come in. And yet I know it. So where do rules like that,

180
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,880
or the himself one that you described, where do they come from? Are they socially determined?

181
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,920
Are they specific to languages or what? Well, you just walked into a big controversy in

182
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,520
logistics. Oh, no. Oh, actually, not, not, oh, no, that's exactly what I love to wander into.

183
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,520
It's an academic controversy. Break it down for us. What is the controversy? Well, if you're a

184
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,800
Chomsky, and meaning someone that follows the syntactic theories of Noam Chomsky, which is,

185
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,600
has been a very influential field of thought in modern American linguistics, you would say,

186
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,600
well, the baby is born with that. It's part of our innate grammar that we're born with. We are

187
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,720
born talking so that we're not not physically talking, but we're born talking in our brain that

188
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,280
we have a specific area of the brain that's devoted to linguistic processing and syntactic

189
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,960
structures. And all it needs is sort of activation or triggering by input from the environment. And

190
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,240
once it hits those triggers, certain, you know, little boxes are checked and it develops language,

191
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,480
this it being the baby. Others are functionalists. And this has become a little more prevalent in

192
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,720
American thinking, I think, in modern eras versus maybe 20 years ago when Chomsky and philosophy

193
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,280
was really the, the only way you would think. And this says that, okay, we are, you know,

194
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,320
born with some capacity for language, there do seem to be some fundamental structures that help

195
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,680
guide the way that baby's brains process for language. But it's not language exclusive,

196
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,920
it's learning exclusive that brains are made to learn in certain ways. And those ways that it

197
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,880
learns interacting with the way the world is certain facts about the world, create a knowledge

198
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:18,160
form that that is universal. And so I think a good example of this would be when we,

199
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:26,240
when we have case in the language. So for example, I in English is object K is sorry, subject case,

200
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,640
and him is an object case pronoun, right? So you see that there's changes in the same or I and me

201
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,280
or he and him. What we find is in languages that are subject verb object, like English,

202
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,920
where the subject goes first, and then you have a verb, and then you have an object like I saw him.

203
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:51,520
Yeah, those languages often don't have case or can lose case without too much difficulty because

204
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,480
the subject and the object are widely separated. And there's a marker in the middle saying, okay,

205
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,160
I'm the verb that acts back on the subject and forward on the the object. So it has a clear

206
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,200
separation between that subject and the object. So it's easy for your brain to process who did

207
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,680
what to whom without case marking, right? That's just a functional fact of the way that that

208
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,680
sentence is structured. But what we find in languages that have the subject and the object

209
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,800
close together like a subject object verb language, I think Japanese is a good example of this.

210
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:28,000
German is like this, I learned it in college. German is like, you're like, I, him, blah, blah,

211
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,320
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, on Tuesday met. And then you have to wait all the

212
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,520
way into the end of the sentence a lot of the time to find out what the verb is. And to see who

213
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,320
is doing what to whom. Right, exactly. So exactly like German, what you find is if you have the two

214
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,160
subjects and the objects right beside each other, it would be very hard if you didn't mark with case

215
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,400
to understand which was the subject and which was the object because they both precede the verb.

216
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,040
And so we just find as a natural functional tendency languages that have that kind of structure

217
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,760
have case languages that don't have that kind of structure don't have to have case. So these are

218
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,960
functional developments that arise for our brain's ability to process information. So again,

219
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,800
there are two very different arguments about how language occurs in the brain and how we learn

220
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,160
these rules. But fundamentally, it's from the way the brain is structured and how we're

221
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,000
structured as humans to process the world. That's really fascinating because whether you're a

222
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,520
Chomskyite or a functionalist about it, and we could, I don't think we need to dive deeper into

223
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,600
the difference, regardless of which one you are, this is part of the structure of how humans work

224
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,840
rather than something you need to learn in a style manual or that you need to be taught in school.

225
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,400
It's actually absent from the rules that you would learn in a setting like that because it's

226
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,880
sort of built into us, which is really, it's really fascinating that the language pedants

227
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,520
don't even bother to tell you about it. But there's all these other rules that they feel that they

228
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,280
often need to enforce. Never split an infinitive, you know, that kind of thing

229
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,840
is very fascinating to me that we end up, that some folks feel a need to have that kind of rule.

230
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,880
Let's move on from the talk about prescriptivism though. One thing I'd love to ask you about,

231
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,240
I know you write about, you write about interject, I literally put it into that sentence,

232
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:30,080
interjections like uh or you know, and I would love to talk to you about this because as someone

233
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,480
who talks for a living, I actually happen to use a lot of them because I think a little bit faster

234
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,880
than I talk sometimes. I have a lot of ideas. I tend to use those words. There have been times

235
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,720
that people in the industry have told me, you should really watch yourself for that and make

236
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,040
sure you don't use those that often because they make you sound stupid or whatever. And then I go

237
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,160
through a little period where I try to stop myself from saying you know so much. But it's so much a

238
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,200
feature of my speech that I don't know, I don't know if I'll ever be able to completely eradicate

239
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
it. So what is your view as a linguist of where those interjections come from and what purpose

240
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,600
they have? Well, first I want to apologize because after we talk about them, you're going to hear

241
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,560
them every time you say them for the rest of our conversation. So we should have saved this for the

242
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,440
end because people are going to hear me do it for the entire rest of the podcast and it's going to

243
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,400
drive them fucking insane. Exactly, once you hear it once and people talk about it. So I apologize

244
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,200
in advance to everybody listening. But the nice thing is we shouldn't be so upset about it because

245
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,760
those things are doing great work for us. And as you said, you talk for a living. It's different

246
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,280
than writing. If I stuck a lot of you know, and all those things in my writing, then it might be

247
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,040
distracting and it might detract from the purpose. But when we're in conversation, our job is not

248
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:53,680
only the strict literal semantic information that I'm trying to transmit. It's also the relationship

249
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:59,200
we have, the ideas we have about it, and also my personal beliefs about what I'm saying,

250
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,720
how I came to that knowledge, whether I'm sure about that knowledge or less sure than that

251
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,600
knowledge, something called epistemics in linguistics. So all these different things are

252
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:17,760
competing for our ability to phrase them somehow. And so things like, you know, actually well. So

253
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,440
all of those help direct the listener to have certain expectations about what the speaker's

254
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,120
intending. And this is actually very helpful as a listener to have someone point out to you how

255
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,320
you're supposed to take something because we all have been in those situations where we say something

256
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,360
and it's not quite taken like we intended it. A lot of times if you don't sign post or provide these

257
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:48,400
conversational cohesion markers, then you increase the tendency of other people to misunderstand

258
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,680
where you're headed, your own relationship to what you're saying, or how certain you were about

259
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,960
what you're saying. So when I say something such as like, when I use like as a discourse marker,

260
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,040
what like communicates in many cases is a subjective sensibility. This idea that what I'm

261
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,040
telling you is not precise, but it's sort of the sense that I want you to get from what I'm saying,

262
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,400
or I want to use it for emphasis. So for example, if I said I was waiting like 20 hours for you,

263
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,400
dude, what I probably wasn't doing is waiting 20 hours and I don't intend for you to take it that

264
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,600
way. What I'm emphasizing by putting that like in there is that, hey, asshole, you made me wait

265
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,640
for a really long time and I pissed off about it. So it's communicating that versus saying,

266
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,840
I was waiting for 20 hours, which certainly doesn't complicate the same force, the same

267
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,440
emphatic force. So all of those little markers are extremely meaningful in our everyday speech.

268
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,760
And in fact, if we look at studies that remove those, those discourse markers like you know,

269
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,920
and like, and well, and so from the speech of subjects, and we have other listeners listen

270
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,120
to them and rate them on how sociable they were, how well likable, how likable they were,

271
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,360
those kinds of things, we find that when we remove those discourse markers, people hear

272
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,520
that speech as less friendly and more robotic. So we want them in there. So you're just friendlier

273
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:17,040
and not a robot. So isn't that good? That is good, except that I often find that other people in

274
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,400
my position, broadcasters, if you watch someone on CNN, you watch a CNN guest, they've likely

275
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,600
trained themselves to remove all the us from their speech. And it's sort of seen as a mark of

276
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,600
professionalism. And but do you think that that maybe that's counterproductive because it's making

277
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,880
those folks less friendly, it makes them seem stiffer or more broadcasty? Or I suppose it depends

278
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,960
on the on the medium, but well, that's actually a really good question, because I think what you're

279
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,040
drawing attention to is two different things than what we were talking about previously. So I was

280
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,320
mentioning discourse markers, like like, you know, some and well, but what you're talking about is

281
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,720
I'm and which are actually filled pauses. So those are fundamentally and functionally different than

282
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,480
filler words, which is what you were talking about previously. And they do very different work. So

283
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,840
we're things like, you know, well, so they, they actually are for conversational cohesion, and they

284
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,560
signpost and provide some epistemic value often. So how someone is to take something. I'm and are

285
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,400
actually markers of speech planning. And they don't don't themselves have any kind of literal

286
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,760
meaning that they contribute to what I'm saying, whereas so does and well does they actually

287
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:37,040
contribute some sort of meaning. I'm and I in fact, are usually more likely to occur when someone

288
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,040
has not rehearsed what they're going to say when we're in spontaneous discourse, when we're saying

289
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,760
them something that's more abstract, more difficult, less familiar, those kinds of situations will

290
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,760
increase the numbers of us and arms that we use. So when we're in a context like a CNN expert,

291
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,640
and we expect someone to know what they're talking about, I'm and I would signal to us that they

292
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,440
are not practiced, and they are not familiar with what they're saying, and therefore would be taken

293
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:10,240
as a disfavorable sign of their ability to communicate. In conversation, though, I want to

294
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,720
know people are working hard to come up with interesting things to say. So if we're in a

295
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,560
regular back and forth conversation at a party or at a bar, and you say a couple times what that

296
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,280
tells me is that you're actually spending some cognitive effort on coming up with what to say.

297
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,440
So in those cases, I don't think there's anything wrong with using them. In a case where I'm giving

298
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,000
a public talk, for example, or I'm on television as a host, I would expect it to be more practice,

299
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,920
and therefore it would probably be less valuable to use those in those contexts.

300
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Oh my god, this is that's such an incredible breakdown of when it's useful and when it's not

301
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,600
and when we actually might want to remove those words and when we might not want to.

302
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,120
And I think a lot of my conversation here, part of what I'm doing in conversations like

303
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,880
this with you, I am thinking on my feet because I'm sort of the I'm the interlock you to hear,

304
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,880
I'm not the expert, I'm asking you questions, I'm trying to be surprised by what you're saying,

305
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,080
you know, and so it makes sense for me to be puzzling through my thoughts as I'm talking to

306
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,360
you because that's the sort of conversation I'm trying to have. So in this context, this is a

307
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,480
good context for me to go, oh, that's really interesting, Valerie. But if I'm in the opposite

308
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,920
context, maybe I'm being interviewed about something I know a lot about, then perhaps it

309
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,920
might be better for me to be a little bit more locked and loaded if I'm trying to communicate

310
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:33,760
more expertise. Also, when you're talking about conversational markers like like,

311
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,200
one that I've heard come up more recently is putting right at the end of a sentence. I find

312
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,840
myself doing that in interviews. Actually, sometimes when I am the expert in a context right

313
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,760
now, I'm being interviewed a lot about union matters because I'm in the leadership of my union

314
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,440
and we're in the news a lot lately because we're on strike. And so something I'll do a lot is I'll

315
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:00,800
explain, right? And I'll just sort of toss that little right at the end. And it feels like a

316
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:07,040
similar sort of social lubrication where I'm trying to draw the audience along and

317
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,240
communicate that I'm making an argument that I hope is going down easily. It seems like a cousin

318
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,440
to like rather than a cousin to perhaps. You know, it's funny because I actually have an

319
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,920
anecdote in the book where I was talking to a podcaster and they were so relieved to hear me

320
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,080
talk about all these different features of having a purpose and being useful because they said that

321
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,200
they're often called out for their over frequent use of right in just the same context you talk

322
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,440
about it. So it must be a podcaster right. Another person who is regularly taken to task for their

323
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,120
use of right in that same way is actually Mark Zuckerberg. He uses right a lot in that context.

324
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,640
So see, you're in very good company. That right is. Well, I don't want to be in company with Mark

325
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,360
Zuckerberg personally. That's what we can get. That's a different episode, but you know, I have

326
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,920
my beefs with Mark, but okay, I understand that we might be using it in the same way. Please go on.

327
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,480
Well, so what you're doing there is actually inviting the audience to make inferences. So

328
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,960
when you use right in that context, you're pausing to let them catch up and say, okay,

329
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,120
I'm checking that you're making the right inference and you're keeping up with me. So it's a

330
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,840
licensure device where you're using it to help give them a moment to get up to speed and then

331
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,000
making sure that they're getting the inference you're intending. So a lot of times people have

332
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,960
dislike that because it causes work on the side of the listener. If you're inviting someone to

333
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,400
make inferences, you're asking them to do work and some listeners may feel like that's asking a lot

334
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,680
of them to do actual work. So, you know, I think it's funny that that bothers us, but I've heard

335
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,720
that one in particular, that inferring right to be something that people remark on quite often as

336
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,360
they've noticed more and more in people's speech. But I think what it really is is just the sign

337
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,880
that we're in conversation and we recognize we have a listener in conversation. It's not just us

338
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,000
talking, right? You're actually, and I just used it, we're actually making sure that someone is there

339
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,360
with us and moving along with us. Now, I think where people sometimes get upset is when they're

340
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,520
listening to people on the radio or on a podcast and they're using that right. And maybe the people

341
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,080
are not agreeing or not making that same inference. And that's where they're getting a little tweaked

342
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,560
about it. Yeah, they're like, Oh, no, not right. I disagree with you. Like, I think taxes should be

343
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:26,480
higher or whatever it is. Yeah, exactly. But no, you're completely correct that I do it because

344
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,200
I am trying to lay out an argument for the person listening and I want them to come along. I was

345
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,440
like, Hey, are you still on the, are you still on the wagon? Like, are we still traveling together

346
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:44,720
here? We're in this together. I'm not just like blah, blah, blah. I'm trying to lay out a trail

347
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,560
of breadcrumbs for you and hope that you follow it and we're in it together. And I'm trying to

348
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,440
remind them of that. At least that's what I think I'm doing. It is wonderful to talk to you. You are

349
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,840
like a therapist for podcasters. And I honestly think this is a fee that you should offer where

350
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,400
you just talk to people about the linguistic ticks that everyone in the YouTube comments is getting

351
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,920
on their ass about. Cause it does, it is something that happens to us as public speakers is that as

352
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,480
soon as someone comments on something like, Oh, do I need to, do I need to change it? And oh,

353
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:21,200
God, everything I'm doing is wrong. You know, it's, it's very, uh, you can really get in your own

354
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:29,520
head. And I guess I wonder what is the value of trying to restrict your own speech in that way,

355
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,440
trying to control your own speech and be rigid with it versus doing what comes naturally. Like a

356
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,680
lot of times on a podcast, I just want to be my natural self a little bit more up and talkative

357
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:45,040
than my natural self, but I'm not trying to, I worry that if I were to police myself for the

358
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,680
rights and the ums and the us too much that I would become stiff and it wouldn't be as good of a

359
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,160
conversation. What do you think? Well, I think then you'd get angry emails saying that you were too

360
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,480
stiff and, and you know, sounded like a uptight stick in the mud. So you're never going to make

361
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,200
people happy. It doesn't matter what it is. There's always going to be something in your speech

362
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,520
that people will respond to and dislike. And the more that you are not white and male, the more

363
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:16,240
often that will happen. So women in particular in broadcast settings get a ton of voice hate mail,

364
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,760
much more than men in similar positions and African Americans likewise. So it really,

365
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,000
which really interesting is we have this set belief about here's how someone should talk,

366
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,200
but that belief is actually fairly fluid in the sense that even if someone talked the way we think

367
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,000
we want them to talk, then something else in their speech is going to irritate us. So, you know,

368
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,320
for every like that annoys somebody and someone's speech, then they'll say, I hate how you use like

369
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,600
while they use so a lot, right? And then for every so at the beginning of a sentence that they use

370
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,640
that someone else hates, that person uses well too much or uses okay all the time or uses right

371
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,800
in the middle of their sentences. So there's always going to be something that someone doesn't

372
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,120
like. And if we try to spend most of our time worrying about what people like and dislike in

373
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,840
our speech, then we're not going to be authentic and real and have connections. And that's the

374
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,280
point of speech in the end. And if we can move away from the idea that there is a right way to

375
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,400
talk and a good way to talk, and then there's a bad way to talk, instead, we look at it as

376
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:25,920
there are ways that we have in common that help bond us as speakers and other ways that help

377
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,120
point to the fact that we are not the same person and that's okay. Then I think we can be a more

378
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,600
connecting empathetic audience and speaker at the same time. It's just getting our head wrapped

379
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,560
around that I can dislike the way that someone talks, but that doesn't mean that the way they

380
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,280
talk is bad. And that's a crucial distinction. That is a wonderful message to take us to break with.

381
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,920
But when we get back, I want to talk to you about teenagers and slang and all these crazy

382
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,200
words that kids are always coming up with. But we have to take a really quick break. We'll be

383
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,080
right back with more Valerie Friedland. Hey, everybody. Just a reminder, if you want to support

390
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,760
See you there. And now back to the interview. Okay, we're back with Valerie Friedland before

391
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,080
the break. We were just talking about how women are often criticized excessively for the way that

392
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,280
they speak their use of language when they're speaking publicly. That's certainly true. I want

393
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,640
to talk about another group of people who are often criticized for their language, which is young

394
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:58,880
people, teenagers or even kids are constantly being told that they're speaking wrong. In my intro,

395
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,400
I talked about this case where a UK school is trying to ban ban the use of slang entirely,

396
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:12,960
which obviously seems completely excessive. Why is slang such a sore spot for adults?

397
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,760
And what purpose does it serve for young people? Well, first of all, anybody trying to ban slang,

398
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,920
good luck with that one. There's just no way. You know, young people are the innovators in language.

399
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,440
And pretty much we have them to thank for all the features of language we use today without

400
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,040
young people. We would have no linguistic revelations, we would have no innovations,

401
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,920
we would have no new words to describe the experiences that we have in our world. So

402
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,520
it's funny that we want to eradicate what they add to our language instead of embrace it. But

403
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,800
I think a lot of it is because what we notice that young people do is invent novel slang that's

404
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:58,080
maybe a little counterculture or rebellious or even taboo in some ways. And a lot of what they say

405
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,920
is never going to hit mainstream and become the language of our future. But the more underlying

406
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,320
things that they introduce, the new ways of using language innovatively like saying,

407
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:17,520
adulting sucks from adult, they follow the pattern that many of us have trod before. So for example,

408
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:25,040
parent was a noun long before it was a verb. So if I say parenting sucks, nobody blinks an eye and

409
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,320
most of us that are parents would approve of that message. But when I say adulting sucks,

410
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,120
I roll my eyes because teenagers are using language in a bad way. But we didn't really see

411
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,880
the word parenting come into widespread use until the 20th century. It was always a noun before that.

412
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Shakespeare was renowned for using nouns as verbs and verbs as noun. So this is just part of the

413
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,480
natural evolution of language. But it's all in the mouths of the young, the young who are more

414
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,520
creative and innovative and more free to do creative things with language that these types

415
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,360
of forms come forth. And because they're different than what we say, and because we think we say

416
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,080
everything correctly, we judge young people for doing it a lot of times because they are doing

417
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,240
it a little bit to piss us off. I mean, admit it when you were a teenager, you wanted to you

418
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,760
wanted to piss your parents off. And the first thing you want to do is speak differently than

419
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,240
your parents. And that drives a lot of this creativity and innovation. But the thing we

420
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,400
forget is that young people also have more neural plasticity than us old folks, which is really

421
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,440
unfortunate for us. But they can make much quicker neurofiber connections, they have more

422
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,720
more neural connectivity. And they also are able to analyze really underlying distributions,

423
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,400
really subtle variations in things better than adults can. So that primes them for linguistic

424
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,040
innovation, because they notice these low lying tendencies at a rate much higher than old people

425
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,200
do. So then the problem is they start to use it. And it's different than what we say. And then we

426
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,760
hate it. So that's really the cycle of language change. This is just there. They have a special

427
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,000
ability as young people that we have lost and we're angry about it. It's like when you see,

428
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:14,080
you know, when you're, look, I cannot ski, I'm so bad at it. And now I'm, I also would never do it

429
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,560
because I am too worried about my joints at this point in my life. I'm not going to take that risk

430
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,320
with my body. And when I see a five year old on skis or a four year old on skis and you see them

431
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,400
and you're like, man, when they fall down, they don't even feel it. They bounce, you know,

432
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,480
and I resent them for that because they have this ability of youth that I have lost. Maybe that is

433
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,000
why we get mad at them. We're like, you're coming up with new words. I can't do that anymore.

434
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,080
Exactly. Well, also remember that when you're five, you're only two feet from the ground.

435
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,440
That helps when you fall. But yes, it's, it's partially that. It's partially that we are a

436
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,120
little resentful of their creativity. But I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we see

437
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:59,280
young people as not quite fully formed. And a lot of times they use language in ways that are

438
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,880
slightly rebellious. I mean, the attraction to new forms of young people is usually because

439
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,920
it's different than what parents do. And it's a little bit rebellious and nonconformist. And

440
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,440
then as adults, we are constantly telling our kids to slow down when they're screaming down the

441
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,760
mountain, right? And we're doing the same thing with language. So even though we might teach them

442
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,040
to ski, we don't teach them to go 100 miles per hour skiing. Same thing with language. We, we give

443
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,200
them the fundamental structure of language. That's our role as parents. And when they're born

444
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,040
and we're, we're giving them input, they're getting our system as the fundamental system.

445
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,400
But then they go to school and they do something called vernacular reorganization, which is just

446
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,640
the fancy linguistic term for they look at their peer group and go, wow, there's so much cooler

447
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,400
than mom. I'm going to be like that. And then they adopt that because that's really who they want

448
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,880
to model themselves after. But I think parents can rest assured that all of that finds its place.

449
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,920
And we, we go through these periods in adolescence where we're really attracted to these rebellious,

450
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:07,440
nonconformist, maybe even nonstandard, maybe even offensive things at times. But what we find is

451
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,320
something called age grading. As kids get into the professional work world, as they become adults

452
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,080
and become parents, they naturally start to adjust their speech towards those old boring

453
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,840
traditional norms that older speakers adopt. So whatever was coming up as a new feature in their

454
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:30,400
speech that's not stigmatized will become the new norm. But stigma stigmatized or rebellious

455
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,120
features tend to get dampened in their rate and they don't get used as much. So like use is a

456
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,680
good example. A lot of people hate like they think their kids use it too much. They want to kill,

457
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,680
you know, kill it in their kids speech. But as kids move from being a 17 year old, you know,

458
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:52,080
like user in every Senate to a 25 year old professional, they will naturally start to use

459
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,000
like less often, even though they want to eradicate it completely from their speech,

460
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,200
but they'll use it at a level that's not highly stigmatized anymore. It's just a natural transition

461
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,560
that happens. That's so cool. Well, one of the things I think is coolest about the way

462
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,720
teenagers or young people use languages, there's like a natural creativity that is so exuberant

463
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,200
that like every school in America has its own slang that no one else has ever heard.

464
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,520
I had a friend who was teaching school at a, you know, at a high school in Brooklyn for just a

465
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,120
couple of years. He's a substitute teacher and he was telling me the kids slang, this is about 10

466
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:32,560
years ago. He said that kids were using the phrase, it's quiet for that now to mean that

467
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,080
something is boring or that it's like old hat, you know, it's, it's, it's passe or that you

468
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,560
shouldn't do something cause it's the wrong time, you know, like you shouldn't, you know, if you're,

469
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,000
if you're like singing a song during study hall or it's quiet for that now, we're not doing that

470
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,400
right now, you know, and I love that phrase. I just love saying it. I still say it to my

471
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,080
girlfriend around the house as quiet for that now. You know, she's like, you want to watch that

472
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,320
show and ask quiet for that now. I don't like it anymore, you know, but it's like this particular

473
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,480
piece of slang. I mean, maybe people, maybe other people in the comments have heard it. Maybe it was

474
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:10,800
all over New York city in 2012 or whatever. But, but I never heard it except from my friend

475
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,840
who reported it hearing it, you know, in the wild. And I'm sure that kids in that school are no

476
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,920
longer saying that they're, that they're onto something else new. And that is, I think the

477
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,360
coolest thing. It's, I mean, that's the true folk process. That's people coming up with their own

478
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,080
exuberant uses of language that means something to them. And then it sort of dissipates over time.

479
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,880
I think that's an amazing thing about language. It is. It's remarkable when you watch young people

480
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,680
in language and how they engage with it, create it, innovate it, and then leave it behind or

481
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,520
embrace it for the future. So a lot of the things you're talking about are slang terms or words

482
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,480
themselves. So my daughter's always using the ones like, they're such a pick me. And I'm like,

483
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,360
what a pick me? What do you mean a pick me? But what she meant was they're a remember in school

484
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,000
when you would be the one wanting to be on the volleyball team, he'd like, pick me, pick me.

485
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Well, now they use that word to mean there's, they're always trying to get out in front and

486
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,680
be the person chosen. So they're always somebody who needs to kind of attention to my daughter's

487
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,560
like, Oh my God, what a pick me. So they've used this creative knowledge of, you know,

488
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,080
this idea of what you do for sports or in gym class to become a descriptor of a person's specific

489
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,360
style of interacting or engaging. Or she'll say, Yeah, I'm so aggressed, which is, you know, I'm

490
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,840
angry. It's just they're really creative and wonderful with language. But those are vocabulary

491
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,920
words, which are actually pretty ephemeral in language, so they can pick them up and use them.

492
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,920
And then when they're not cool anymore, or too many people do it, or especially if adults start to

493
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,800
pick it up, then it's bye bye, right? I'm not interested. But what we don't understand is that

494
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,040
young people are actually the heart of language evolution more generally, so that what they're

495
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,680
doing with language at a much more subtle structural level, the changes that they're making

496
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,440
in very small tweaks and refinements are actually going to be the future of our language in bigger

497
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,200
ways. So let me give you an example that maybe you hadn't noticed. When you're using words like

498
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:11,200
everybody, somebody, nobody, do you even say buddy anymore? Or do you say everyone, someone, no one?

499
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,360
Everyone. I actually couldn't tell you. I would think I would think I use, let's say everyone was

500
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,560
there, everybody was there. I'm not sure which I'd use more often. To be honest, I'm sorry to not

501
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,000
have a good answer. Well, you probably know it's actually not surprising because people are not

502
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,240
very reflective on that, right? You don't think about everybody or no one. And that's how language

503
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,000
change happens, where one form starts to be used more often by people that are somehow cooler or

504
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,160
hipper or better than you in some way socially, often in adolescence. And what seems to be happening

505
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,440
is buddy is being replaced by one, especially among younger speakers. You see very few younger

506
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,920
speakers say everybody, somebody, nobody. In fact, almost all of them say everyone, someone, no one.

507
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,160
Now that's a much more, that's a much more underlying structural change. It's not a slang

508
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,040
word. It's not a vocabulary word. But when we look now at older speakers, we find that starting

509
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,520
to creep into older speakers speech. So when we do a study and we look at different age groups,

510
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,520
what we find is that everybody, the buddy in those words is losing ground to one,

511
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,680
which will be in 10 years, 15 years, probably the only form that we use anymore and everybody

512
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,760
and nobody will seem very archaic and old. So these are actually the more substantive types

513
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,400
of change that young people bring into our language. Another good example is using weight

514
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,120
as a discourse marker. So I might, if you're, you know, somewhere and I need to go get something,

515
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:42,560
I might say, could you wait five minutes, meaning physically stand for some time to wait for me.

516
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,120
But what we find now is people are saying, wait, I don't think so, where they're actually using

517
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:53,200
weight as a discourse marker, which doesn't really mean weight any particular amount of time. When I

518
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,360
say weight, I don't think so. I'm not telling you to physically stop and wait for me. What I'm

519
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:03,680
saying is a metaphorical pausing. I'm taking a metaphorical pause here. What we find is that's

520
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:09,520
also a new change coming in young people say, wait a lot more than older speakers who don't

521
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,840
say, wait, they say, wait a minute. And so it went from no discourse marker where weight was only

522
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:22,000
used as a main verb that actually meant pausing to wait a minute used by older speakers to mean

523
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,800
metaphorical pausing to now younger speakers that only say, wait, not wait a minute. And what we

524
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,640
find is when we look 50 years ago, when we start to study that change, not only was it young

525
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,640
speakers, it was lower class young speakers and lower class and young are the magic sauce to

526
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,240
language change. And that seems to then suggest that that will be what we say going forward that

527
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,640
wait a minute is gone the way of the dodo and weight will be the new discourse marker. So

528
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,640
these are really cool things that we don't even realize we're doing. And then they work their

529
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,600
way into our language because young people started them. Yeah, that is so fascinating. Now I was

530
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,320
about to ask you about race and language because that's, you know, there's a lot of interactions

531
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,120
there in American life. You just brought up class though, class and race often intersect in American

532
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:14,960
life. So how do those elements come into it? I mean, obviously there's a history of race in

533
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,840
America is very fraught. A lot of our, I think, greatest language innovations come from marginalized

534
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,880
groups throughout American history. How do those things work together? Well, absolutely. Just like

535
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:31,280
lower class speech features being something that is often a triggering impetus for change.

536
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:38,320
So is ethnicity. And not only that, but it could also be things like not necessarily ethnicity,

537
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,640
but other subcultures that are marginalized like drag culture. Drag culture is actually

538
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,920
brought a lot of words into our language. So for example, vogue is a word that came from drag

539
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,280
culture. And I think the word of the year this year was a suffix called ussy, which was the

540
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,200
ossification. Who's word of the year? Was that Mariam Webster? That was the American Dialect

541
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,000
Society's word of the year because that was also from drag culture where it was the ossification

542
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:12,560
of all things could be ossified. The American Dialect Society is cool, man. You're with

543
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:20,720
it. I assume you're a member. I am a voting member. Yes, I am. You voted for ussy. I did not actually,

544
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,440
there was another word I really wanted. I have to say ussy was a runner up, but I can't remember

545
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,440
what my, see it's gone. I don't even remember it anymore because it didn't win. Oh, wow, because

546
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,440
it's not the word of the year. Well, no, ussy is like, look, all you got to do is look at the

547
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,600
TikTok comments and you'll see that ussy is indeed the word or the suffix of the year.

548
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,840
So yeah, I mean, tell me more about that phenomenon.

549
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:47,920
Well, you know, what happens is things happen in adolescents that are cool and interesting that

550
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,400
have nothing to do with the types of things that we value as adults, especially standard speaking

551
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:58,240
adults who disdain anything associated with marginalized groups or groups that we disfavor in

552
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,320
society. But when you're a young person and you're in school or you're in a community,

553
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,480
what you really want to do is stand out in some way. We also want to sort of project these

554
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,040
different kinds of identities. And a lot of times that's tied into these groups that are

555
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:19,600
marginalized in society, such as African-American culture or drag culture or whatever culture

556
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:25,200
that you're identifying with, but particularly in inner city schools, if you want to, you know,

557
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,120
not get beaten up for your lunch money every day, one of the ways to do that is project

558
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:36,400
speech features that signal toughness, nonconformity, physical strength. And one way that particularly

559
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:43,600
young white men do this is to be adopting the features from groups in school that they identify

560
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:50,320
as physically tough, as rebellious, as nonconformist, as dangerous in some way. And even though these

561
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,600
are stereotypes about those cultures that are not true to the cultures themselves, they have much

562
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,320
more depth than that. The features that those groups use, so African-American features in

563
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:07,120
particular, are often then appropriated by these young men to personify those identities, like

564
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:13,280
being tough, being cool and being macho, to help them fit in in the world. And then these features

565
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,560
then grow up with them. So they become part of the language of the larger mainstream culture,

566
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,840
which is how we get a lot of features, like even the word jazz, which was actually an African-American

567
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:29,200
word, get into mainstream culture. And I think one way we see it now is woke. The word woke was

568
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,760
actually an African-American English word that now has made it into mainstream culture for better

569
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,800
or worse, depending on how you look at it. Well, then depending on how it's used, I mean, the problem

570
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:45,920
is that even though these are the folks who are being incredibly innovative with language, right?

571
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,120
As you say, the intersection of youth and class and marginalization that sort of caused the

572
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:56,960
innovation and also caused it to be adopted by the more, you know, by the dominant, you know,

573
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:03,040
normative folks, it's the marginalized groups who get criticized for their use of language or

574
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,000
attacked for the use of language. I mean, just, you know, having gone through, you know, in the

575
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,600
90s, growing up in, you know, the war over ebonics as a phrase where that became a punchline, right?

576
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:22,000
As, you know, a pretty well-meaning linguistic project was turned into a joke that was, you

577
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,960
know, on the everybody in white culture made fun of for a couple of years at the same time

578
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,680
that they were then appropriating those same words and those same speech patterns is like a

579
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:37,040
really pernicious cycle, is it not? Absolutely. I mean, the funny thing is that we really hate

580
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:43,040
language change. We think it's somehow bad that it points to some sort of decay in society, but

581
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:49,360
it's really because language change typically begins in the groups that we have stereotypes

582
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:55,920
or prejudice against. And because of that association, we dislike it and we try to push it

583
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,960
away. But it is, it's very much the fact that we don't police our language when we are members of

584
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,240
marginalized communities, according to the norms of the dominant society, that we allow in-group

585
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,640
markers to develop, that we allow different linguistic tendencies that are underlying all

586
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:18,320
language to just affect change in our varieties, that those things come out of those groups rather

587
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,920
than the groups that maintain these standards and forcibly don't let their language adapt.

588
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,360
And then it becomes staid and boring and it doesn't have much life. I mean, look at Latin,

589
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,760
right? We didn't, we don't allow Latin to change and no one's using that to hang out and go to the

590
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:39,200
bars and form solidarity and connection. But when we allow language to emerge and become

591
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,840
naturally communicative, naturally connection making, naturally part of our identity process,

592
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:52,880
then it becomes something that other people look at and basically want to take over because

593
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,720
we want what that represents. We want the social connectedness that we feel those features

594
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:06,400
amplify. So when I hear someone using really low sort of informal, low class speech, it might

595
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,200
seem bad to me as a speaker of standard English, but it also means like they're informal, they're

596
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,760
intimate, they're relaxed, they're familiar, they're friendly, right? It has these other

597
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,440
associations. And when I'm an adolescent, that's really attractive to me. I want that. I want to

598
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,920
have that. And also, even when I'm a standard speaker, when I go home and talk to my kids or

599
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,000
I go home and I talk to my spouse, I don't want to come home talking like the office. I want to

600
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,280
use the speech that's connection, the speech that's familiarity, the speech that's intimacy.

601
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:42,240
And you can't get that without some emphatic senses, some subjective senses, some natural

602
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,880
laid back kinds of features. And those are what we draw from in marginalized group speech,

603
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,640
because that is what that has come to represent, the connection, the community, the social identity

604
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,720
of friendliness, of companionship, of solidarity. That's something that even the most

605
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:06,240
priggish people who want to criticize marginalized group... And by the way, when you say we don't

606
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,360
like that speech, I like to think that I do like it. I'm more broad-minded about it.

607
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,480
But even if somebody is that priggish about it and they're like, oh, how dare they talk that way,

608
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,840
they're still hearing that language going, oh, I wish I had that level of community.

609
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,400
I wish I could partake in that a little bit. And they end up adopting those words because

610
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:32,320
communicates a certain level of informality and ease with other people that we all crave in our

611
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:38,480
lives to have... Oh, you hear another community talking with that kind of ease. I want to use

612
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:44,720
those words too, because they communicate comfort and community in a way that I crave. And that I

613
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:51,600
don't get from my formal, rigid, office, white, affluent talk. And I think there's also, especially

614
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,800
with African American speech, there's an edginess and a counterculture-ness that we tend to

615
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,080
find associated with those kinds of speech forms. And a lot of that has to do with the very fact

616
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:08,640
that we marginalize those communities. When we push a community to the extremes, to the edges,

617
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:16,720
then we also create a situation where we almost envy their status as outsiders and as rule breakers

618
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:23,600
and as sort of being non-traditionalists. And even though they didn't ask for that role, and often

619
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:30,080
they have traditions of their own, from the perspective of the dominant group, that's the

620
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:36,320
kinds of qualities that get put on their features of speech, put on their styles of dress, put on

621
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:42,160
cultural things that they have associated with them. Music. Right. And so then that becomes enviable

622
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:48,960
because it seems cool and edgy and chill and laid back and whatever qualities, edgy and even

623
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,600
gangster, right? I think a lot of young speakers, young male speakers are attracted to that kind

624
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,240
of dangerous, rebellious sort of sense that it has. And that's really something we put on it

625
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,880
because we pushed it to the outside. But then by doing that, we want to bring it back in and make

626
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,240
it part of our speech so that we can get those qualities that now those features have when they're

627
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:13,440
used by members of that community. So it's this really interesting cycle of pushing out, pulling

628
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:19,360
in, pushing out, pulling in. But then, of course, what happens is young speakers adopt it and then

629
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:26,000
older speakers who don't see the value in it, disdain their speech as well, until those become

630
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,320
more dominant and are used in wider culture. So when words like jazz or woke start to get picked

631
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:37,520
up and move more mainstream, we almost forget where they came from, which then is a disservice,

632
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,040
of course, to the people that started them. So it's a weird vicious cycle.

633
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:48,800
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're describing really the structure of how racism and marginalization

634
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:55,440
eventually leads to appropriation. And in some cases, theft, in some cases, productive borrowing.

635
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:05,520
But you're just describing the entire problem of American culture and race and it just through

636
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:11,920
linguistics. I mean, and it really goes to prove the point that you learn so much about

637
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:17,440
people and the structure of a society through language, which sort of, it gets to my point

638
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:25,360
that I made in the intro to this episode that we waste so much time criticizing the speech of others,

639
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:30,800
whether that's marginalized groups or each other or ourselves, when we could be learning from

640
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,320
that speech. We could be understanding, oh, wait, this says something about the speaker,

641
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:41,600
about the structure of our society that we use language in this way. Does it not?

642
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:47,040
Absolutely. And I think if we think back to the history of English, one great example of us doing

643
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,000
this and now it's so assimilated into our language that we don't even remember that we did it, is

644
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,520
how many, many of the words that we use in modern English and even our pronouns, for example, come

645
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:04,000
from the Vikings who were definitely not looked upon favorably when they were pillaging in the

646
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,440
eighth and ninth centuries. But a lot of the words that we have, so for example, the pronoun they

647
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,680
and them, those are Norse, those are Norse words, words like window and sister and skirt,

648
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,720
those are Norse words. And the interesting things about the words that we borrowed from Norse,

649
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:27,760
from the Vikings, are their everyday words, the words about life. Because when we interacted

650
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,960
with the Vikings, when it wasn't vicious, obviously, when it was, you know, in everyday

651
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,400
interactions, it was about the day to day work of life. It was about seeing each other in the farms

652
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,040
and learning from each other in those casual interactions. But when we interacted with the

653
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:48,320
French, it was up, right? It was because they were the rulers, it was us as the servants,

654
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,280
them as the rulers. So the types of words that we have from French tend to be the highfalutin

655
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,200
words, words from medicine, words for law, like the word judge, the word prison, the word government,

656
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,520
those are all from French, because that's the kind of interaction we have with them. So when we

657
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:09,200
look at even the types of words that come in from these different subcultures, we learn a lot about

658
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,720
our relationship with those speakers. Yeah. And man, it's just, as soon as you start looking for

659
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,240
this stuff, you see it everywhere. I mean, even what I do is stand up comedy, right? It has its own

660
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,000
language. It has its own way of speaking. One of my favorite things to do is talk to other stand

661
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,080
up comics in a green room. And we have our own, it's not quite a dialect or even a, you know,

662
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,560
sort of a, you know, Carney language or anything like that. It's just like there's a few,

663
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:40,800
there's a few unusual words. There's a few unusual ways of speaking. There's extreme casualness that

664
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:47,840
like connotes a, you know, that we're participants in a certain, in a certain world. And some of those

665
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:52,800
words, if, but not all have made their way into the, into the broader language. George

666
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:57,440
Carlin famously did a bit about how you kill, you crush, right? If you did well and you die,

667
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:04,160
if you, if you bomb, you bomb, right? There's all these words about violence. But, you know,

668
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:10,400
it's like, this is happening in a million subcultures around the world at every single moment. And

669
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,840
it's such a beautiful thing about language. And all we can really do is, is hope to describe it and,

670
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:20,400
and use it to understand each other rather than make rules around it. I think, I don't know.

671
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:26,080
Absolutely. And I think once you start unraveling that thread, it's so cool where it leads because

672
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,560
you, you have these ideas about language that are formed from this weird thing you do in school,

673
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:35,040
right? You go to grammar class and that's really your only knowledge of language. If you think

674
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,520
about what have I learned about language in my lifetime? It is simply, I have learned that there

675
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:44,400
are nouns and there are verbs and how I'm supposed to string them in a sentence and that I'm not

676
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,360
supposed to end my sentences with prepositions or split my infinitives, because I learned this thing

677
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:54,800
in grammar class from the time I was five to the time I'm, you know, 25 or whenever you finish

678
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:59,840
graduate school or whatever you're doing. But we never learn about language as a system. We never

679
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:05,040
learn about language as a science. We never learn about language as a history. But all of those

680
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:10,960
things are what brought language to where it is today. They're, they're so much embedded in the

681
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,360
culture of language and the science of language that we could really learn from. And that's what

682
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,440
I was trying to do with my book. I'm trying to bring that history and that background and that

683
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:25,360
science out so that people can understand why we say the things we do. Where does light come from?

684
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:31,200
Well, like 300 years old. So it's pretty cool that we still use it today and it's not new. It's

685
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,600
not American. It's actually British. So, you know, these really cool little threads that once you

686
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,160
untangle them, it opens this whole new way of looking at language. It's very, very cool.

687
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,400
Amazing. Valerie, it's been so incredible talking to you. Tell us once again the name of the book

688
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,640
and where people can get it. Sure. The name of the book is like literally dude, arguing for the

689
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:54,320
good and bad English. And you can buy it wherever books are sold, Amazon or your local bookstore.

690
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,760
That's my preference. If you want to go give them some, some money and some book sales,

691
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,200
that would be great. But anywhere books are sold, you can find it. And of course, if you want to

692
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,320
buy it through our special bookshop, you can get it at factuallypod.com slash books, factuallypod.com

693
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:12,320
slash books. You'll be supporting not just the show, but also your local bookstore as well,

694
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,160
if you buy it from there. Valerie, we didn't even get to talk about dude. I'm afraid that people

695
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:24,880
will have to buy the book in order to learn about it. Dude. Well, dude, dude, I can't believe it.

696
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,560
Thank you so much for being here, Valerie. Hope you'll come back again and talk to us about this

697
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,280
again sometime. I would love to. And I think I can only end it by saying later, dude. Later, dude.

698
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,320
Well, thank you once again to Valerie for coming on the show. Once again,

699
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:43,360
