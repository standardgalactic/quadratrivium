Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.

00:05.600 --> 00:10.160
This week, we're talking once again about climate change. See, a couple weeks ago,

00:10.160 --> 00:14.800
I had Dr. Hannah Ritchie on the show, and she made the case that if you look at all these different

00:14.800 --> 00:20.880
indices, emissions per capita, the price of renewable energy, deforestation, a lot of things are

00:20.880 --> 00:26.320
moving in the right direction, and that that is cause for hope. Now, I expressed some skepticism

00:26.320 --> 00:30.400
about this and a lot of you did as well in the comments below the episode. And that's because,

00:30.400 --> 00:34.800
you know, we have made some progress, but the progress we have made is clearly insufficient.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.640
And even though we've made progress on some solutions that have leveraged the power of

00:38.640 --> 00:43.120
capitalism to say, make one kind of energy cheaper than another, sell electric cars and stuff like

00:43.120 --> 00:48.640
that, well, that's kind of the easy solution, isn't it? To sell clean energy when it's just as cheap

00:48.640 --> 00:54.960
as fossil fuels. But getting people, or God forbid, massive corporations to give up fossil fuels is

00:54.960 --> 01:00.800
hard. So how do we push powerful interest in governments to overlook short-term profit for

01:00.800 --> 01:06.800
the long-term benefits of having a planet that's, you know, habitable? I ask how, because clearly,

01:06.800 --> 01:13.200
we haven't done it yet. Climate change is only partially a problem of technology. Primarily,

01:13.200 --> 01:19.280
it's a social problem that our entire society caused. And it's an open question whether our

01:19.280 --> 01:24.080
collective decision-making institutions are advanced enough to deal with that problem.

01:24.080 --> 01:28.560
I mean, it's much easier to make a cheaper solar cell than it is to get all world governments to

01:28.560 --> 01:34.640
agree to decarbonize, but mass decarbonization is what we actually need, right? So if we want to

01:34.640 --> 01:39.840
look at how society can change, we need to look at more than just technological fixes. We have to

01:39.840 --> 01:46.000
look at the science behind what causes social change in institutional transformation that is a huge

01:46.000 --> 01:50.800
and hard problem. And you can't figure it out just by looking at the atmosphere or brand new

01:50.880 --> 01:56.320
awesome clean technologies. You need to talk to a sociologist. Well, guess what? On the show this

01:56.320 --> 02:01.520
week, we in fact have a sociologist who has written an incredible new book about how we can

02:01.520 --> 02:06.800
actually create the massive social change we need to fight climate change in the face of

02:06.800 --> 02:11.200
corporate opposition to that change. I know you are going to love this interview, but before we

02:11.200 --> 02:15.280
get to it, I just want to remind you that if you want to support this show and all the conversations

And now let's get to today's guest. I am so excited to introduce you to Dr. Dana Fisher.

02:40.560 --> 02:45.040
She's a sociologist and she's the director of the Center for Environment, Community and Equity

02:45.040 --> 02:48.800
and a professor in the School of International Service at American University.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.720
She's been following the politics and sociology of climate change for decades,

02:52.720 --> 02:58.000
and her new book is called Saving Ourselves from Climate Shocks to Climate Action. Please welcome

02:58.000 --> 03:05.200
Dr. Dana Fisher. Dana, thank you so much for being on the show. Thank you for having me, Adam.

03:05.200 --> 03:09.040
So we talk about climate change a lot on this show. Normally, I'm talking to climate

03:09.040 --> 03:13.440
scientists, technologists, people like that. You are a sociologist. You have written a book

03:13.440 --> 03:20.480
about the climate crisis. From a social perspective, why is that such an important lens to use?

03:20.480 --> 03:25.680
Well, I mean, at this point, everybody recognizes that the climate crisis is actually a social

03:25.680 --> 03:31.760
problem, right? We created the problem, we society, and the only way to solve it is actually through

03:31.760 --> 03:37.120
us. Society is going to have to solve it. It's not like the planet is going to save itself,

03:37.120 --> 03:42.560
right? We got to do it because we got to fix the problem we created. So sociology makes a lot of

03:42.640 --> 03:45.760
sense as a place to look for that because we study social processes.

03:45.760 --> 03:52.720
Right. We can learn as much as we want about the atmosphere or about clean energy technology,

03:52.720 --> 03:57.360
but if we don't understand the people who are actually going to implement those things or do

03:57.360 --> 04:00.160
something about it, then we're going to be up Chitts Creek, right?

04:00.160 --> 04:03.920
Right. I mean, I think it's worth noting here that there are a lot of natural scientists and

04:03.920 --> 04:09.200
atmospheric scientists who have started talking about policy, have started talking about the

04:09.200 --> 04:14.960
social side because they are social beings, and that's great. But there are those of us who are

04:14.960 --> 04:20.320
trained and have PhD specifically in actually studying the social processes and how they work

04:20.320 --> 04:25.600
and have spent our lives and our careers doing that, and I'm one of them. And so we're, I mean,

04:25.600 --> 04:31.840
I think that we provide a lot of opportunity to think through, based on research, how social

04:31.840 --> 04:38.160
systems work and what will be opening opportunities and what will probably not work.

04:38.160 --> 04:42.400
Great. Well, let's zoom out and start using that lens. A lot of people have a lot of different

04:42.400 --> 04:46.640
stances on climate change. People are techno optimists, whatever. You told me before we started

04:46.640 --> 04:51.040
recording, you would describe yourself as an apocalyptic optimist. I want to know what that

04:51.040 --> 04:55.520
means and how do you frame the problem of climate change like most broadly?

04:55.520 --> 05:01.920
Okay. So I'm an apocalyptic optimist. That means that I believe that we are in trouble and that bad

05:01.920 --> 05:06.640
things are coming and that it is bad. It's getting worse and nothing we've done so far is going to

05:06.640 --> 05:12.320
solve the problem yet. But I am optimistic because while it's bad and it's getting worse,

05:12.320 --> 05:16.400
I believe that we have the capacity to save ourselves and I talked through the book,

05:16.400 --> 05:20.480
how we're going to do that. But it's all going to come from us, right? It is not going to be

05:20.480 --> 05:23.520
like the technology that's going to fall from the sky and everybody's going to be like, oh,

05:23.520 --> 05:26.640
I thought that was going to be bad, but it's okay. It's not going to work that way. It's

05:26.640 --> 05:31.040
rather that it's going to involve struggle and work and we're going to have to all get angry to

05:31.040 --> 05:36.320
do it. With regard to understanding the climate crisis and what it is, I mean, basically,

05:36.320 --> 05:41.840
in the broadest way, it is the fact that the entire world, the entire industrial system,

05:41.840 --> 05:48.080
is run on burning fossil fuels, which is basically having the unintended consequence

05:48.080 --> 05:53.120
of increasing concentration of greenhouse gases. The one that we talk about the most is carbon

05:53.120 --> 06:01.360
dioxide in the atmosphere, which is changing the way that our planet absorbs heat. And also,

06:01.360 --> 06:06.800
that is then having an effect on all sorts of environmental systems and climate systems

06:06.800 --> 06:13.680
and the oceans and the poles and the ice caps, et cetera, and so forth. So everything's changing

06:13.680 --> 06:18.080
thanks to these concentrations that have built up over decades now.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.320
Stopping burning fossil fuels basically means that, I mean, I don't know if this is solar,

06:22.320 --> 06:27.840
but I'm assuming it's not. So all of the electricity that we run our lives, our businesses,

06:28.400 --> 06:33.920
most of our transportation, all that has to change. I mean, carbon comes from a whole bunch

06:33.920 --> 06:41.200
of things. Methane emitted by cows, asses. Yes, exactly. The ruminants, all the ruminants emit

06:41.200 --> 06:45.280
methane. It's just that cows get most of the attention. You know, goats do it too. So there

06:45.280 --> 06:49.760
you have it. Well, if you're in a goat cheese, you know. If you're getting birria tacos, like

06:49.760 --> 06:54.400
you are also emitting methane. So sorry, but please go on. Anyway, so the problem is really

06:54.400 --> 07:00.800
tricky because we have to change the entire system that we are running our economies on,

07:00.800 --> 07:05.360
basically. I mean, there are a couple of countries that have done relatively well because they have

07:05.360 --> 07:10.880
the capacity for clean energy. Some countries like Norway, for example, dammed their rivers early on,

07:10.880 --> 07:17.280
so that 99% of all their electricity is actually coming from clean energy because it's hydropower.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.800
And there were very few people except for indigenous folks who lived up there. So they

07:20.800 --> 07:25.040
were able to do it really easily. We don't have that capacity here in the United States. Most

07:25.040 --> 07:30.640
countries don't have that capacity. Isn't Norway also a huge oil driller? Like, don't they have a

07:30.640 --> 07:37.440
gigantic sovereign wealth fund that comes from oil reserves? They absolutely do. And in fact,

07:37.440 --> 07:41.200
one of the things that's kind of ironic about it is they are using those resources to

07:42.080 --> 07:48.080
incentivize people within the country to switch to electric vehicles, right? But they're still

07:48.080 --> 07:52.160
making money. They're still opening up areas for extraction, but then they're selling the oil to

07:52.160 --> 07:56.000
other countries. Yeah. See, this is a little bit of a tangent, but I went to Norway a couple years ago

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
and a lovely country. One of those countries where you go and you're like, why can't everything be

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
like, oh, they got solar panels. They got wind, oh, everything's so nice here. Oh, my, everyone's so

08:04.000 --> 08:07.760
polite. Oh, they got public transportation. Everything's good. And then I'll look around for a

08:07.760 --> 08:11.680
little while. What's funding it? This kind of feels like I'm going to my, like a rich kid's house,

08:11.680 --> 08:15.680
you know? Like, I live, like I'm in a neighborhood, I'm middle class, but oh, come over to my house.

08:16.240 --> 08:20.640
This kid's got a super Nintendo. They got like a fridge with a nice dispenser. What's going on?

08:20.640 --> 08:24.880
Oh, what does his dad's do for a living, right? Like this is, this is wealth that I'm looking at.

08:24.880 --> 08:30.320
And where does the wealth come from? They have a gigantic nationalized oil reserves that they're

08:30.320 --> 08:35.760
selling to other countries. So it's a little bit of like underneath the surface, there is a dark

08:35.760 --> 08:40.160
participation in the same system that we're all a part of. Absolutely. I mean, and what's interesting

08:40.160 --> 08:45.520
is that when folks talk about countries addressing climate change, a lot of them

08:45.520 --> 08:50.080
are talking just about what they're doing within their borders, right? But a lot of countries,

08:50.080 --> 08:55.200
including the United States, has considered basically addressing climate change internally,

08:55.200 --> 08:59.440
but then continuing to self also feels abroad, right? So for example, in the United States,

08:59.440 --> 09:04.640
there's a big push to talk about how we could sell our natural gas to other countries because,

09:04.640 --> 09:08.640
you know, it's cleaner and, you know, and our labor practices are better, which, you know,

09:08.640 --> 09:13.120
may very well be somewhat true, but it really doesn't solve the problem. So anyway, going back

09:13.120 --> 09:18.720
to the question. So the climate crisis is a really tricky one because it basically involves

09:18.720 --> 09:23.280
shifting everything and all the ways that we have industrialized and the ways that we live our lives.

09:24.400 --> 09:29.760
And that's one of the reasons that nothing really has been done in the past 25 years or 30 years

09:29.760 --> 09:34.720
since the climate regime began, which is the international kind of efforts to address climate

09:34.720 --> 09:38.880
change. But I think with regard to techno optimism, the reason I'm no longer a techno

09:38.880 --> 09:45.120
optimist is because I have, you know, I have supported and been excited by a number of different

09:45.120 --> 09:49.520
fads. In fact, I was just had a friend of mine who reached out and was like, oh yeah,

09:49.520 --> 09:53.840
clean hydrogen. Green, or sorry, they're calling it green hydrogen now. Green hydrogen, that's the

09:53.840 --> 09:59.440
answer, right? And the deal is that when I was in college, which was in the 1990s, we went through

09:59.440 --> 10:03.520
a whole period of time where we were like, ooh, hydrogen is going to be the future, right? I mean,

10:04.000 --> 10:09.440
that was a long time ago now. I recognize that. It's just that if we keep counting on technology

10:09.440 --> 10:13.840
that's not here yet, we're running out of time. Hey, so that's five years away that's going to

10:13.840 --> 10:19.760
fix everything. And then you have to have diffusion of the technology. I mean, it's just,

10:19.760 --> 10:26.000
it's not going to solve the problem if you want to save large portions of the world that are

10:26.000 --> 10:30.240
basically, I mean, some of them are already going to be lost, right? Lots of small island states are

10:30.240 --> 10:34.320
going to be lost. Lots of coastal areas are going to be lost. Lots of developing countries are going

10:34.320 --> 10:39.520
to have to shift their populations to areas that are cooler or have the resources because

10:39.520 --> 10:44.160
a lot of folks are becoming, areas are becoming resource scarce because of the climate crisis

10:44.160 --> 10:50.080
in terms of water, in terms of food. And as a result of all of that, we're going to basically

10:50.080 --> 10:54.560
have to think about how we address it. And leaning into this idea that don't worry the

10:54.560 --> 10:59.600
technology is almost here, right, is just extremely dangerous. And it's not just dangerous globally,

10:59.600 --> 11:03.520
but it's dangerous for us here in the United States. I mean, look at Arizona. I mean, look

11:03.520 --> 11:07.840
at some parts of California this past summer and this coming summer is going to be even worse.

11:07.840 --> 11:12.720
Yeah. So you said that nothing has been done or very little has been done for the past few decades.

11:12.720 --> 11:16.080
A number of weeks ago, we had a wonderful guest on named Hannah Richie who wrote a book called

11:16.080 --> 11:19.680
Not the End of the World, a lot of the thesis of the, and by listening to the episode, if you

11:19.680 --> 11:22.720
haven't, it was a wonderful conversation. It's a great conversation. I listened to it yesterday.

11:22.720 --> 11:26.320
Oh, okay, great. So I'd like to put you in dialogue with that because I think it'll be really

11:26.320 --> 11:32.800
interesting. Now, her take is, you know, I think a lot of people feel as I did, you know, I grew up

11:32.800 --> 11:37.600
in the Captain Planet era, we have to save the planet needs to happen. And then, you know, here

11:37.600 --> 11:43.600
I am 25 years later, right? I'm like, we didn't do it. We didn't save the planet. Sure. Things

11:43.600 --> 11:47.840
sure seem to be getting worse. What the fuck, right? And a lot of Hannah's argument is like,

11:47.840 --> 11:51.600
actually, a lot of progress has been made. If we look at these charts and look at these graphs,

11:51.600 --> 11:57.600
we can see a lot of shocking, surprising progress has been made and we need to continue that and

11:57.600 --> 12:01.360
increase it. She's often described by people as a techno optimist. Certainly people were in the

12:01.360 --> 12:07.840
comments of our post on YouTube calling her that. So I'm curious how you engage with that argument.

12:07.840 --> 12:11.680
What do you think that argument gets right? And what do you think it gets wrong with all respect?

12:11.680 --> 12:17.440
Yeah, I mean, so I would just say that, you know, the analysis is legitimate in that it is true that

12:17.440 --> 12:23.120
a number of environmental problems have improved over the years. The problem with climate change,

12:23.120 --> 12:27.920
however, I mean, and climate change is the issue that I have focused basically my whole career

12:27.920 --> 12:33.040
the past 25 years on, is that climate change is a political issue. In fact, it's a social

12:33.040 --> 12:38.160
problem in that we have caused the problem and we, as a society, are going to have to solve it.

12:38.160 --> 12:46.160
And to date, the most valuable measure of success of our efforts to address climate change

12:46.160 --> 12:51.280
would be concentrations of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And if

12:51.280 --> 12:57.520
you look at every one of those charts, it's like a straight slope. So it's not tapering off. It's

12:57.520 --> 13:05.200
not like flattening at all. No, I mean, there was a blip during COVID and we are back on track

13:05.200 --> 13:11.200
just like we were before. So yes, there has been a lot of efforts. There have been efforts globally

13:11.200 --> 13:17.360
through multiple efforts through treaties. I actually studied a bunch of them. So I mean,

13:17.360 --> 13:21.200
I started out my dissertation was on the Kyoto Protocol, which was like a lifetime ago, which

13:21.200 --> 13:27.680
was one of the efforts to address climate change. It was not successful for a number of reasons.

13:27.680 --> 13:32.240
More recently, we have the Paris Agreement where most countries have not yet met and are not going

13:32.240 --> 13:39.600
to meet their commitments that they made back in 2015, right? Yeah. So the thing about, you know,

13:39.680 --> 13:45.840
the argument is that we, you know, while things are getting better and we are per person maybe

13:45.840 --> 13:51.440
emitting less, we're still emitting more, right? And concentrations of the atmosphere are continuing

13:51.440 --> 13:55.760
to go up. And that is the only thing that the earth cares about, right? The earth doesn't care

13:55.760 --> 14:02.000
about if each person is emitting less. I mean, sure, that's better. But the population is going

14:02.000 --> 14:08.320
up too, right? So I mean, and so for me, you know, I'm looking at the bottom line and I also

14:08.320 --> 14:12.080
am looking at the politics of it, right? The other thing that a lot of people talk about is how we

14:12.080 --> 14:15.920
do have policies, right? We have a policy in place here in the United States now, finally,

14:15.920 --> 14:21.360
after years. And I have studied all of the failed policies before. So I was delighted to be able to

14:21.360 --> 14:27.040
write a paper about a successful policy in the Inflation Reduction Act. But not, you know, still

14:27.840 --> 14:33.680
we continue to emit more greenhouse gases every year and temperatures are going up and we got a

14:33.680 --> 14:39.040
problem. So, you know, there's been going on for decades. They've been having these big conferences

14:39.040 --> 14:42.960
and everyone's optimistic, right? Right afterwards. I remember I did an episode of Adam ruins

14:42.960 --> 14:49.120
everything right after the Paris Agreement. And, you know, we, we covered it as it was covered by

14:49.120 --> 14:53.440
basically everyone at the time. This is the largest step that's ever been taken. It shows

14:53.440 --> 14:57.600
international cooperation on a scale we've never seen before. It's, you know, there's such reason

14:57.600 --> 15:02.560
for optimism, et cetera. Or this is the best reason for optimism that we have. And here we are

15:02.560 --> 15:07.440
sitting here, you know, what, seven years, eight years later, just sort of casually describing it

15:07.440 --> 15:12.160
as, ah, well, you know, none of them are going to meet the targets, right? So what are the

15:12.800 --> 15:17.360
impediments to when all of the people at these conferences and all the people running the most

15:17.360 --> 15:22.880
important countries, US, European countries, China all agree about the problem, right? They're

15:22.880 --> 15:28.640
certainly not ignorant about it. Why is progress not being made? Well, I mean, before we, before

15:28.640 --> 15:32.000
we talk about progress not being made, I just want to say, I mean, one of the things that's

15:32.000 --> 15:38.320
interesting is that so they do, they have these meetings every year and people fly all over the

15:38.320 --> 15:45.520
world to go to them and the participation at these events has exploded over the past few years.

15:45.520 --> 15:50.160
And I mean, this past year, they had this wonderful diagram of all the people who took

15:50.160 --> 15:55.840
private planes in and came in and I mean, including some well-known folks here in the

15:55.840 --> 15:59.840
United States who showed up in their private planes. They didn't even carpool. They just,

15:59.840 --> 16:04.720
they all took their own private planes, showed up and then like, we're like, oh, climate change,

16:04.720 --> 16:08.640
bad. We have to do something about climate change. Yeah. But they're not actually practicing what

16:08.640 --> 16:13.120
they preach. Now, so I just want to make these individuals are so important that, of course,

16:13.120 --> 16:18.400
their travel is worth, you know, it's a little extra carbon, but, you know,

16:18.400 --> 16:22.160
Bill Gates, he's got to be here and there, right? He's got to be, if he doesn't get

16:22.160 --> 16:28.960
from Lisbon to Buenos Aires in whatever, 20 minutes, then people are going to die, right?

16:29.520 --> 16:34.080
I mean, I would just say like, let's just start with carpooling or whatever you call it when

16:34.080 --> 16:37.440
it's air pooling. I don't know what the word is, right? I mean, let's just start that.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.160
You want to hit your ride? Like we're going the same way. We can save gas.

16:42.160 --> 16:46.400
And they can join Taylor, right? I mean, she flies all over. She's flying constantly. I mean,

16:46.400 --> 16:49.200
they're doing a big move around here. You should just have the climate conference

16:49.200 --> 16:53.680
where the Taylor Swift concert is happening, right? That would save a lot of carbon emissions.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.520
I mean, I would just say that, I mean, I also would love it if she would think about maybe

16:57.520 --> 17:02.400
cutting down the pyrotechnics a little. I don't know if you've been to a Taylor Swift concert.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.640
I have kids. I've been to many Taylor Swift concerts.

17:05.840 --> 17:09.920
You're there with like an air quality sensor going like, uh, guys were in the purple, like

17:09.920 --> 17:13.280
she said, don't breathe in, everybody hold your breath now. I mean, but it's also,

17:13.920 --> 17:18.560
you know, it's very consumptive. Let's just put it that way. But okay, going back to your question,

17:18.560 --> 17:22.560
yes, I can remember what your question was. Oh, why is it not working? Is that the question? Okay,

17:22.560 --> 17:28.720
so the reason it's not working is that all of these countries are symbolically gesturing

17:28.720 --> 17:31.760
that they care about climate change. I mean, everybody, everybody cares about climate change

17:31.760 --> 17:36.560
now except for a very small proportion of people in the United States. But that's different from

17:36.560 --> 17:42.720
actually acting on it because acting on it is not easy. Like we talked about before. So to act on

17:42.720 --> 17:48.800
it means basically committing to phase out fossil fuels and fossil fuels are a huge part of economies

17:48.800 --> 17:54.160
of many industrialized nations. We just talked about Norway, the United States number one natural

17:54.160 --> 18:01.040
gas exporter and oil exporter right now. So yay us. But I mean, that means that for us to actually

18:01.040 --> 18:05.360
follow through on commitments to phase out fossil fuels means there's going to be a lot of folks

18:05.360 --> 18:09.760
who have what we call privileged access to resources in the form of access to

18:10.720 --> 18:15.520
fossil fuel resources. They're subsidized, right? So they get subsidized access to our federal lands

18:15.520 --> 18:22.480
to drill and take what they can. They also have privileged access to power. And they get that

18:22.480 --> 18:27.120
because they basically contribute to campaigns. And it's not just Republicans, it's folks across

18:27.120 --> 18:32.800
the aisle who take that money and research shows us that when you take money from the fossil fuel

18:32.800 --> 18:37.360
interest, even if you run on a climate sensitive platform where you say you care about climate

18:37.360 --> 18:40.720
change, you want to do something about climate change, when you're asked to vote, you will vote

18:40.720 --> 18:46.160
with the people who fund you. And so that happens all over the world. But United States is a great

18:46.160 --> 18:53.200
example of it. So there is a very, very strong concentrated interest in maintaining the status

18:53.200 --> 18:59.040
quo. And so fossil fuel interests that run countries, run companies, run our industries,

18:59.040 --> 19:03.520
they are basically pushing back. I mean, I was a contributing author for the Intergovernmental

19:03.520 --> 19:09.280
Panel on Climate Change for the most recent round, the most recent assessment. We call that the IPCC.

19:09.280 --> 19:14.800
And so I actually, I wrote this section on civic activism and engagement for working group three,

19:14.800 --> 19:18.960
which is on mitigation. So that's the folks who are talking about how to reduce the carbon that

19:18.960 --> 19:24.800
goes into the atmosphere. And I was so excited to be asked to do this. This is the first time they

19:24.800 --> 19:29.520
ever asked people to talk about activism and engagement. That's what we individuals and

19:29.520 --> 19:33.680
those people who are not in the government and not in business is what we can do about the problem.

19:33.680 --> 19:39.440
So I was very excited to write that. I wrote this. I contributed like 10 pages.

19:39.440 --> 19:46.640
They took three paragraphs, which is how these things work. But when they go from the contribution

19:46.640 --> 19:50.480
to what ends up going to the countries, what goes to the countries is what's called the

19:50.480 --> 19:54.800
summary for policymakers, where they do, it's like the Cliff Notes version. So my chapter was

19:54.800 --> 20:00.560
over 100 pages long. I think it ended up being like 20 pages maybe. I got two sentences in there.

20:00.560 --> 20:05.360
But countries get to approve what goes in there and they took out all reference to fossil fuels.

20:05.360 --> 20:11.200
Wow. So, I mean, and so because countries, all countries get a say and countries that extract

20:11.200 --> 20:16.400
a lot of oil don't want anybody to know. So this was a summary that was put up by the

20:16.400 --> 20:22.880
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Yes. And they took out references to fossil fuels

20:22.880 --> 20:26.320
when they were summarizing, which is the part that that's what like Biden, everyone else is

20:26.320 --> 20:29.040
reading. They're reading the summary. They're not reading the full version. Oh, sure. Yeah.

20:29.360 --> 20:34.880
I mean, and so what they did is we had to change it from fossil fuel interests to what are called

20:34.880 --> 20:41.840
vested interests. And the thing is that this was a huge success that vested interest got in. And

20:41.840 --> 20:47.200
so we were supposed to be like, oh, yay, we're so lucky. I mean, so in, if you read the chapter,

20:47.200 --> 20:51.520
you'll see the references to the role of fossil fuel interests play. And it's extremely well

20:51.520 --> 20:57.440
documented. I mean, nobody at this point recognized, like nobody believes that fossil fuels are not

20:57.440 --> 21:02.640
playing a big role in contributing to climate change, if you are honest about understanding

21:02.640 --> 21:07.280
the science, right? Yeah. But you still can't say it. I mean, and also, I mean, look at what

21:07.280 --> 21:11.520
happened at the most recent round of the climate negotiations, there were a bunch of countries

21:11.520 --> 21:19.200
that were pushing to get the countries to agree to phase out fossil fuels, right? And it ended up

21:19.200 --> 21:24.480
like dragging on and on and on and a bunch of petrol states that extract a whole bunch of fossil

21:24.480 --> 21:28.880
fuels pushed back against it. So it ended up being this like mealy mouth, we should think about at

21:28.880 --> 21:36.080
some point, phasing out, you know, maybe fossil fuels, you know, I mean, that was the end. I mean,

21:36.080 --> 21:40.880
and everybody was like, yay, I mean, and all of these, all of these people in policy, all these

21:40.880 --> 21:47.440
people in the media were like, finally, we actually kind of said the quiet part out loud, kind of,

21:47.440 --> 21:50.880
but we still didn't. I mean, that's the thing that's crazy about. And so that's the same thing

21:51.440 --> 21:57.600
with the science is that when you have politics and science combined, the way you do for this,

21:57.600 --> 22:02.080
because this is specifically like a scientific assessment that's designed for the policy

22:02.080 --> 22:08.880
community and is coordinated through the different states, when you do that, and you have a bunch

22:08.880 --> 22:14.880
of countries that are basically controlled by fossil fuel interests, you know, it's not surprising

22:14.880 --> 22:21.200
that we see this kind of tricky situation. But it means, I mean, and the more we know that a systemic

22:21.200 --> 22:27.200
shift away from fossil fuel energy towards renewable clean energy is what is needed,

22:27.200 --> 22:32.800
the more these interests are going to like claw and just try to control the dialogue as much as

22:32.800 --> 22:37.680
they can, so that everyday people don't recognize that when fossil fuel companies give money to

22:37.680 --> 22:41.760
candidates who are running for office, like in this election that we have coming up,

22:41.760 --> 22:45.120
those people, whether or not they say they care about climate change are absolutely not going

22:45.120 --> 22:51.520
to do anything about it. Yeah, because their incentive is not to. But what you're talking about,

22:51.520 --> 22:56.000
what you talked about with three different pieces of that story, is politics, right? Like you,

22:56.560 --> 23:01.680
when you are writing and trying to get the right language into the report, that's part of the

23:01.680 --> 23:08.880
political process, as is fossil fuels companies giving money to candidates, as is entire countries

23:08.880 --> 23:15.360
who are basically bent to the will of the fossil fuel makers. But what do we do about that? Because

23:15.360 --> 23:19.920
a lot of folks when confronted with the existence of politics will just say, oh,

23:19.920 --> 23:24.880
fuck, I can't believe politics got in here. Oh, no, there's people, there's corruption,

23:24.880 --> 23:29.040
there's people giving money. Oh, the people who are giving money to do something do the thing

23:29.040 --> 23:32.400
that they're giving the money to do. Oh, the people who have the most power get to call the shots,

23:32.400 --> 23:38.480
right? But unfortunately, politics is just part of the human condition. Politics simply is,

23:38.960 --> 23:44.000
humans in large groups having to make decisions together. And yeah, and unfortunately, people

23:44.000 --> 23:48.240
with power get more say, and that's just how the fucking world works. And if you want to do something

23:48.240 --> 23:53.600
about it, you have to reckon with the political social system that you live in and figure out how

23:53.600 --> 23:59.360
to bend it to your will to do the thing that needs to be done. So I don't want this to be one of those

23:59.360 --> 24:03.200
episodes where we sit around going, I can't believe the fossil fuel companies are like,

24:03.200 --> 24:06.160
have their finger on the scale, they should stop it because they're not going to.

24:06.800 --> 24:11.360
What do we do about that problem? Well, I mean, I just want to say, though, that what you're just

24:11.360 --> 24:15.600
pointing out here is exactly why we can't just say everything's going to get better if we ignore

24:15.600 --> 24:22.320
politics because that's the way decision making happens. And if you ignore the politics and just

24:22.320 --> 24:26.000
assume technology is going to fix everything, well, then you're just going to be really,

24:26.000 --> 24:30.960
really sad in like 20 years or even less, right? Guess who's going to be in control of the technology,

24:30.960 --> 24:35.360
the people with the political power. And if you didn't ignore politics, or if you didn't pay

24:35.360 --> 24:39.120
attention to politics, then you're allowing those people to continue steering the ship.

24:39.120 --> 24:43.280
100%. So what's going to happen now? Or what do we need to do right now? I mean,

24:43.280 --> 24:48.400
so, I mean, this is what I lay out in the book is that the beginning of the book is all about how

24:48.400 --> 24:53.360
we cannot count on decision makers to do what is needed, even though they recognize the problem

24:53.360 --> 24:59.200
exists. And the reason that that's the case is that we see these interests that have captured

24:59.200 --> 25:03.520
decision making and have this privileged access to resource and power, right?

25:03.520 --> 25:08.960
So, okay, so that's not the case. And at the other side of it, businesses, some of which are

25:08.960 --> 25:12.400
really excited about technological innovation, they're not going to save us either because

25:13.360 --> 25:16.880
many businesses are pushing for a clean energy transition. We have a bunch of other businesses

25:16.880 --> 25:22.800
that are clawing their way into extracting as much as possible fossil fuels as they can because they

25:22.800 --> 25:27.760
know that eventually they're going to have to stop. And so there's this bipolar pressure between

25:27.760 --> 25:31.920
these two. So it's not like we have this monolith of, oh, business is really excited about this

25:31.920 --> 25:37.280
technological innovation because they're not. So given that that's the situation, the place where

25:37.280 --> 25:43.600
we have to go to get hope is from everyday citizens, you and me, and the way that we ourselves are

25:43.600 --> 25:48.560
recognizing how the world is changing, how our lives are changing, and how we have to reclaim

25:48.560 --> 25:52.960
power. And one of the beauties of being an American and being in the United States is we still do

25:52.960 --> 25:57.840
have a democracy, at least for now. And we should be taking advantage of it because a democracy

25:57.840 --> 26:03.440
means that we all have power. We have an imperfect fucked up democracy, but occasionally the will

26:03.440 --> 26:08.960
of the people does win. The will of the people can still win, but it's up to us. And that's,

26:08.960 --> 26:12.480
I mean, that's the whole argument on my book is that as unfair as it seems, because we didn't

26:12.480 --> 26:18.320
really cause the problem and we are trapped in a system that is unfair, but we can still take

26:18.320 --> 26:23.280
power back and that's absolutely what we have to do. And so that's the optimistic part of my

26:23.280 --> 26:29.600
apocalyptic optimism. So how do we do that? Because again, a Captain Planet generation,

26:29.600 --> 26:34.400
right, I grew up with, turn the lights off, buy the better thing, right, maybe feel a little bit

26:34.400 --> 26:40.960
guilty when you fly on a plane or whatever, maybe get a Prius, those sorts of things. I've covered

26:40.960 --> 26:47.120
extensively in my work why that sort of consumer approach to fighting climate changes, at the very

26:47.120 --> 26:52.880
least not going to get us out of the problem all by itself. So yeah, what do we actually do?

26:53.280 --> 26:58.960
So what we need to do at this point is we need to lean into activism and engagement. I mean,

26:58.960 --> 27:03.360
and I talk about the reason why even though all of these individual efforts like you were talking

27:03.360 --> 27:09.360
about can play a role in addressing climate change, given that it's a systemic problem,

27:09.360 --> 27:14.240
that's not enough, right? Because anyway, you're going to turn on the lights and unless you are

27:14.240 --> 27:20.000
completely off the grid or you're in a very small proportion of the United States where

27:20.480 --> 27:24.480
you're on clean energy, you're basically then tapping into the same system, right?

27:24.480 --> 27:29.440
There is a really interesting study that I talk about in the book where some students at MIT

27:29.440 --> 27:34.640
tried to map out carbon consumption of everyday people and they ended up mapping out the carbon

27:34.640 --> 27:39.600
consumption of an unhoused person in Boston, right? So somebody who was homeless, who was

27:39.600 --> 27:43.520
living on the streets, but was also going to shelters, right? And they found this person who

27:43.520 --> 27:49.840
has no like very few earthly belongings, right? And who is living in a shelter actually has the

27:49.840 --> 27:55.600
carbon consumption level of well above most of the developing world, right? Because of the system.

27:55.600 --> 28:01.920
So it is a systemic problem. So this is if you were to divest yourself of every single energy

28:01.920 --> 28:07.520
consuming thing that you have as an American or a Canadian or someone else living in our,

28:07.520 --> 28:12.640
you know, part of the world or our part of the socioeconomic ladder, you literally were living

28:12.640 --> 28:18.640
on the street, you would still not be, you know, able to get your individual level down to

28:18.640 --> 28:22.800
make people elsewhere in the world. Well, you could live in a bunker and go like completely

28:22.800 --> 28:27.200
off the grid, like you can do that. And then you personally will not contribute to the climate

28:27.200 --> 28:31.200
crisis, but the system will continue, right? Yeah, exactly. But I mean, but if you just like,

28:31.200 --> 28:36.080
if you try everything, like for example, we at home, we have electric cars, we have solar panels,

28:36.080 --> 28:40.640
but whenever I go to work, I turn on the lights and my computer runs on the system. And so even

28:40.640 --> 28:44.960
though the electricity at home is clean, yeah, it's not clean everywhere else. You're in control

28:44.960 --> 28:50.480
of like the cloud servers that Apple is using to store your emails and what power they were like,

28:50.480 --> 28:54.960
you're part of a system. Yeah. Yeah. And my Alexa that is tracking everything I said. I didn't even

28:54.960 --> 28:59.120
go there. And every once in a while, she just speaks up and says, I hear that you are interested

28:59.120 --> 29:03.920
in games to play with your children. Can I suggest some? And it's like, shit, no, I don't want you

29:03.920 --> 29:07.600
to suggest. And she's burning fossil fuels every time she listens to you. Well, she at home, she's

29:07.600 --> 29:12.240
burning solar. So at least, so at least I have that. But the servers. Oh, yeah. But when she backs

29:12.240 --> 29:16.880
out, she backs up absolutely with like probably coal. So, you know, the dirtiest of them all.

29:17.920 --> 29:22.480
Anyway, so the question that you asked was about how we take power back. So I was just saying,

29:22.480 --> 29:27.600
so individually, we can't do it alone. We need to work collectively. And one of the beautiful

29:27.600 --> 29:32.400
things about the United States is that we have a really long history of social movements and

29:32.400 --> 29:37.040
activism. So one of the things I do in my book is I basically build off of some of the things that

29:37.040 --> 29:41.520
we learn from the civil rights movement, which is the most studied movement ever in the history of

29:41.520 --> 29:47.440
the world. So we know a lot about it. But basically, what we can do is join collectives and get

29:47.440 --> 29:53.360
engaged in our communities, get engaged in climate activism, climate engagement to help to push for

29:53.360 --> 29:56.880
social change. I mean, one of the things that I think is most important is to push for social

29:56.880 --> 30:01.120
change from our communities up. So we don't just decide, I mean, and this is something that my

30:01.120 --> 30:04.880
students and I are always kind of discussing. I think I've won them over because like in the

30:04.880 --> 30:10.640
semester is in like two weeks, which is that you can't really do this all by just going on TikTok.

30:10.640 --> 30:15.360
And I think a lot of young people and a lot of students learn that the sad hard way with the

30:15.360 --> 30:19.520
decision that the Biden administration made around the Willow project, which is this huge

30:19.520 --> 30:25.040
fossil fuel infrastructure project that has been approved by the administration in Alaska.

30:25.040 --> 30:29.840
And all of these young people went online and went on TikTok. It was this huge mobilization on

30:29.840 --> 30:35.520
TikTok. There was like millions of online signatures onto a petition on change.org.

30:36.080 --> 30:39.760
There was a whole bunch of people posting videos about stopping the Willow project.

30:40.400 --> 30:44.480
But there was no in-person action or there's very little in-person action. And unfortunately,

30:44.480 --> 30:50.000
as a result, or not as a result, but unfortunately, the Willow project moved forward, right? So they're

30:50.000 --> 30:55.200
building that out. And a lot of young people are recognizing, I hope they're recognizing and learning

30:55.200 --> 30:59.520
that you can't just go online and do this, you need to actually work with people. And the best way

30:59.520 --> 31:04.320
to do it is to do it in your community. Well, a lot of people make this argument about online

31:04.320 --> 31:10.640
activism. And I see that myself as well, that people tweet and hope it's going to do something.

31:10.640 --> 31:16.560
But I also recognize that the reason a lot of people resort to that is they do not have other

31:16.560 --> 31:22.080
systems in their lives where they feel like they can express themselves. There isn't a mass movement

31:22.080 --> 31:28.080
organization in their area, or they just feel profoundly alienated from their community. A lot

31:28.080 --> 31:36.640
of folks don't have other outlets. So that's a real problem that people face. How can people get

31:36.640 --> 31:42.720
connected? Especially because I just want to add to this that my own experience following the climate

31:42.720 --> 31:47.280
movement is that we have had attempts at mass movement organizations, those organizations,

31:47.280 --> 31:52.960
I believe 350.org is at the name of one, the Sunrise Movement, which was doing, I think,

31:52.960 --> 31:56.160
incredible work for a couple of years. But in the last couple of years, sort of gone,

31:56.240 --> 32:00.880
where are they? No offense to my Sunrise Movement people, right? There's people out there carrying

32:00.880 --> 32:08.720
the torch. But we have not seen, I mean, a year or two ago, there was a giant climate mass

32:08.720 --> 32:13.680
climate march, I think in multiple cities, barely covered in the press. And so there's been an

32:13.680 --> 32:20.160
attempt to build this mass movement akin to the civil rights movement. And yet, for at least a decade,

32:20.160 --> 32:25.600
and yet it has not really paid off. So why is that? And how can we change that?

32:26.240 --> 32:29.280
You're like, you're like in my sweet spot right now. So thank you very much.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.800
Oh, I'm so happy to set up a guest.

32:31.520 --> 32:36.720
Thank you so much. Okay, so first and foremost, let me just say that this is completely to be

32:36.720 --> 32:41.840
expected. Anybody who remembers the period of the Trump administration, there was this huge

32:41.840 --> 32:45.520
resistance to the Trump administration as policies. Anybody who's interested, I wrote a book called

32:45.520 --> 32:49.840
American Resistance that was all about it. It was a mass mobilization. It was the largest

32:50.160 --> 32:54.320
sustained period where people were in the streets and people were active and engaged,

32:54.320 --> 33:01.680
that we have seen since the civil rights period and the anti-war period. So that was like the 1960s,

33:01.680 --> 33:05.840
1970s, right? So since then, this was like remarkable. Everybody, I mean, the Washington

33:05.840 --> 33:11.840
Post did this survey and they said that like, what was it? One in four people had been to a

33:11.840 --> 33:15.520
protest during the first two years of the Trump administration. And there were multiple types

33:15.520 --> 33:20.000
of protests. It was the women's march. It was the wake of the murder of George Floyd. It was a

33:20.960 --> 33:24.960
bunch of things over a span of years. Yeah, yeah. So it was a span of the whole Trump

33:24.960 --> 33:29.520
administration. So the resistance was amazing. And people were the most civically engaged they

33:29.520 --> 33:35.840
have been in decades, right? But so what happens when a Democrat takes office is frequently we see

33:35.840 --> 33:40.080
the left kind of sitting back. And I actually wrote, I wrote a few, we can take a load off. Oh,

33:40.080 --> 33:46.080
boy, what's on TV? I got to, you know, I finally, I can catch up on my reading. Where's my new,

33:46.080 --> 33:51.280
where's my pageant book reading? Okay, maybe like, I hope so. Reading is good thing. But

33:52.000 --> 33:57.520
so, so it was not surprising. But I mean, and I actually wrote a piece that was like,

33:58.240 --> 34:02.800
the, you know, Biden's success is the death of the resistance and the resistance, the resistance

34:02.800 --> 34:07.360
did die. So you mentioned a couple of different organizations. I mean, 350.org is still around.

34:07.360 --> 34:12.800
They do great work. Sunrise is still around. They do great work. But these groups have a lot less

34:12.800 --> 34:17.920
capacity to mobilize people because the general public on the left, when there's a Democrat in

34:17.920 --> 34:21.680
the White House, they're like, All right, I think we're good. I'm going to take a load off. I'm going

34:21.680 --> 34:26.320
to pay attention to my kids. I'm going to catch up on my Netflix. Maybe they're going to read. I

34:26.320 --> 34:31.040
hope they're going to read. But you know, I think maybe maybe they'll read my book. Maybe that'll

34:31.040 --> 34:35.520
get them back out in the streets. But I mean, so, so that's all to be expected. And that's what I

34:35.520 --> 34:41.120
talk about my book is that we know that, first of all, that activism is cyclical and people are

34:41.120 --> 34:46.960
going to need something that motivates them to get out in the streets and to connect collectively,

34:46.960 --> 34:51.120
especially because most people don't have what we call like organizational infrastructure,

34:51.120 --> 34:56.880
which is connections to organizations that are in their communities that help them get active.

34:56.880 --> 35:01.920
And we know that organizations play a very important role in channeling people's concerns,

35:01.920 --> 35:08.640
their anger, their outrage into action. So we need that. So how does that then happen? And what I

35:08.640 --> 35:13.520
talk about in the book is that it's going to come from the experience of climate shocks.

35:13.520 --> 35:17.120
And I can give you, you know, I can give you some evidence around this is that the largest

35:17.120 --> 35:22.000
climate march that we've seen since Biden took office. So since, you know, in years now was the

35:22.000 --> 35:27.360
March 10 fossil fuels, which happened last fall in New York City. And it was right before the UN

35:27.360 --> 35:32.160
meeting where the secretary general said, you have to actually have some sort of commitment or you're

35:32.160 --> 35:35.760
not allowed to come to my meeting. And so a bunch of countries, I believe the United States even

35:35.760 --> 35:39.760
were not invited. So it was a very interesting. Yeah, it was very interesting. Didn't really do

35:39.760 --> 35:44.240
anything. It's a real Regina George move. Yeah, but he was trying. I mean, he was really trying.

35:44.240 --> 35:50.240
Anyway, so 75,000 people marched in the streets of New York City. And one of the things I do is

35:51.040 --> 35:56.320
I survey protesters. So I went out with a team of researchers, students who were working with me,

35:56.320 --> 36:01.920
and we did what we call like a field approximation of a random sample. So we basically went through

36:01.920 --> 36:06.320
teams throughout the whole crowd and surveyed people to get information on who they were,

36:06.320 --> 36:10.080
why they were there, et cetera, and so forth. You're doing sociology. Yeah, I am a sociologist.

36:10.080 --> 36:14.960
Yes. But this is something, this is like a lens that the climate crisis is not often looked at

36:14.960 --> 36:20.720
through. It is unfortunately the case. I mean, so it is increasingly looked at through a sociological

36:20.720 --> 36:26.080
or social scientific lens. But one of the things that's really unfortunate is that while we know

36:26.080 --> 36:30.720
a whole lot about how the world is warming and how a little bit more carbon in the atmosphere will

36:30.720 --> 36:35.680
affect warming and will affect hurricanes and et cetera and so forth, I mean, always more accuracy

36:35.680 --> 36:40.720
is necessary. We know a heck of a lot less about the people who will respond and what we will do

36:40.720 --> 36:45.200
and how it will matter. And so one of my hills that I'm going to die on is saying that we need

36:45.200 --> 36:51.120
more research funding to support that because social scientists get like pennies on the dollar.

36:51.120 --> 36:59.600
Right. We spend so much money researching the hard sciences. We spend so little on researching

36:59.600 --> 37:05.040
the people who we need to implement what the hard sciences come up with.

37:05.040 --> 37:09.040
Well, I would say it's even worse than that. It's the people who are causing the problem,

37:09.920 --> 37:13.680
as well as the people who are going to have to solve the problem. So we know so little about

37:13.680 --> 37:20.480
that. And that was one of the reasons that when I wrote for the IPCC, the rules of the IPCC are

37:20.480 --> 37:25.120
you need to be able to prove how whatever you're looking at is associated with carbon.

37:25.600 --> 37:30.960
Right. So people march in the streets. Well, how does that affect carbon emissions or decisions

37:30.960 --> 37:35.280
around carbon emissions? And there's not that much research. There's a lot more we need to

37:35.280 --> 37:39.680
know about that. So I mean, it would be really great for me to be able to say, okay, if you go

37:39.680 --> 37:44.720
into a museum and you throw soup on a covering of a painting, it equals this much carbon.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.640
Right. I mean, they want me to be able to say that. I mean, I would love to be able to answer

37:48.640 --> 37:53.440
that. I mean, are you going to have better effects in terms of reducing carbon emissions

37:53.440 --> 37:58.080
if you throw soup on a painting, you glue yourself to a door, or you sit in the middle

37:58.080 --> 38:04.720
of the highway, right? But it's an important question. And how much, I mean, so the reason

38:04.720 --> 38:08.560
that folks are doing that kind of activism, which is a lot of what I talk about in the book,

38:08.560 --> 38:11.680
is because they're trying to get media attention. So it's really like, it's like a boomerang,

38:11.680 --> 38:16.000
right? It's an indirect process. So you do those things, you're going to be in the media.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.760
And a bunch of people are going to say, he sucks for doing it. And then other people are going to

38:19.760 --> 38:24.560
say, but he has a point. I should join a movement. And so they will very rarely be like, I'm going

38:24.560 --> 38:28.400
to throw soup. No, they're going to say, I'm going to go work with like a more, you know,

38:28.400 --> 38:34.480
a more benign, kinder, gentler group. So I may join like a League of Conservation

38:34.480 --> 38:38.720
Photos or Sierra Club or I may do something around my local elections or something to do,

38:38.720 --> 38:42.560
you know, to do something around weatherization in my community, something like that, right?

38:42.560 --> 38:45.440
So you may get involved in that. But the question is all of that, like,

38:46.000 --> 38:49.680
how does that then end up with carbon? Yeah, it would be amazing if we could say,

38:49.680 --> 38:52.960
so often folks are presented with a statistic. Oh, if you switch to an electric car,

38:52.960 --> 38:57.520
you'll save this many trees, this many tons of carbon, whatever. And that's supposedly a hard

38:57.520 --> 39:02.000
calculation, even though there's a lot of assumptions and all that and all that within it.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.120
But you could, wouldn't it be wonderful if you could tell people, hey, if you were to join a

39:07.120 --> 39:11.280
local chapter of the sunrise movement in your area and go to one meeting a month,

39:11.280 --> 39:16.720
it would save this many tons of carbon. We could do that. We just need to be able to develop the

39:16.720 --> 39:22.000
models and run them. But those models are, let me just say, like those models are a lot simpler

39:22.000 --> 39:27.440
than the models that are being funded right now to talk about how sandstorms over in Africa are

39:27.440 --> 39:31.920
contributing to hurricanes. And there are people doing that research. And it's important. I am not

39:31.920 --> 39:35.840
saying it's not important. I think everybody should be funded. But I think that, you know,

39:35.840 --> 39:40.240
those of us who are trying to answer these questions, we need to understand that. I mean,

39:40.240 --> 39:44.960
and we need to be able to think about that, right? What is it? So if I were talking to,

39:44.960 --> 39:49.600
like, the general public and you want to do something, is it better for you to support a

39:49.600 --> 39:54.960
candidate who won't take fossil fuel money and is running for office locally in terms of your carbon?

39:54.960 --> 40:00.560
Or is it better for you to get electric school buses into your schools? Or is it better for you

40:00.560 --> 40:06.400
to go and try to get your local school, you know, universities to divest from fossil fuels?

40:06.400 --> 40:13.920
Or is it better for you to throw soup on something and or crazy glue your foot to something and get

40:13.920 --> 40:17.360
a bunch of media attention so that everybody starts, you know, complaining about you, but

40:17.360 --> 40:21.520
talking about the climate crisis, because it absolutely works that way. And I mean, we could

40:21.520 --> 40:25.520
do those things. And I'm hoping, you know, there are a couple of us who actually wrote a piece for

40:25.520 --> 40:30.240
Nature magazine that came out right before the last climate negotiation. So in the fall,

40:30.240 --> 40:33.440
where we basically talked about all the things that we could study and we know a little bit

40:33.440 --> 40:37.520
about, but we need to know so much more about. And unfortunately, so far, we haven't gotten one

40:37.520 --> 40:42.880
dollar to do that work, but we know that work is necessary. Eventually, we will do the work,

40:42.880 --> 40:47.840
but I hope it won't be too late because people need to know now what's the best way to get involved.

40:47.840 --> 40:53.200
But any, but my the take home message of the book is that anything that everybody that anybody is

40:53.200 --> 40:58.640
willing to do is what you should do, because we are in all hands on deck moment, people need to

40:58.640 --> 41:03.440
get involved, they need to get connected, they should do it in their communities. Oh, I mean,

41:03.440 --> 41:07.920
one of the, well, I was going to, like I wish I had said, you know, one of the other things

41:07.920 --> 41:13.840
that we really valuable to do is to like do the modeling to say, if you do something on TikTok

41:13.840 --> 41:18.160
versus you do something in your own community, which what's the carbon there? And you and I

41:18.160 --> 41:22.240
both know how that carbon is going to lay out, right? Because just, you know, the question of how

41:22.240 --> 41:29.440
much posting on TikTok actually leads to reductions in carbon or more consumption could be maybe,

41:29.440 --> 41:34.320
right? Hey, everybody, you know how much I value internet privacy. We have talked about it many

41:34.320 --> 41:39.600

You know, I am all about those little pick-me-ups throughout the day. Whether it's conquering

43:07.120 --> 43:12.320
work tasks or doing chores around the house, I need a little treat to reward me. It is a must.

43:12.320 --> 43:16.720
And you know what gets me smiling every time? Japanese snacks. Not only are they bursting

43:16.720 --> 43:21.600
with flavor, but the cute packaging and quirky vibes add an extra layer of fun. That is why

43:21.600 --> 43:26.960
teaming up with Bokksu, a Japanese snack subscription box, has been an absolute delight.

43:26.960 --> 43:31.520
And these aren't your run-of-the-mill grocery store snacks, okay? Every month, Bokksu brings you

43:31.520 --> 43:37.520
over 20 unique treats that you can normally find only in Japan. Plus, they throw in a nifty guide

43:37.520 --> 43:42.960
packed with info about each snack and Japanese culture. So you get to snack while you learn?

43:42.960 --> 43:48.240
Are you kidding? This was literally made for me. Oh, and by the way, each box ships straight from

43:48.240 --> 43:52.000
Japan straight to your door. Okay, so I'm going to try one of the snacks for you. I got my little

43:52.000 --> 43:56.960
guide right here. I think this week I'm going to go for the Soka Senbei Uma Zorame. This Senbei

43:56.960 --> 44:02.240
rice cracker boasts a uniquely irresistibly tart and sweet flavor combination of Ume Japanese plum

44:02.240 --> 44:07.680
and zorame, a coarse granulated sugar. Cool. Now this says it contains wheat and soy, so that's

44:07.680 --> 44:11.680
good to know for you gluten folks. There are plenty of gluten-free snacks in here. Here's the

44:11.680 --> 44:20.400
cracker. Oh, this looks so good. Let me give it a try. Oh my god. You hear that crunch? It's like

44:20.400 --> 44:26.160
tart. It's a little salty. It's a little sweet. It is delicious. And I never would have gotten to try

44:26.160 --> 44:31.680
this if Bokksu hadn't sent it straight to my house. And you know, my favorite thing about Bokksu is

44:31.680 --> 44:36.800
that they support small, family-run businesses in Japan. Bokksu has sourced your treats by working

44:36.880 --> 44:42.160
with over 245 small makers in Japan, helping out their businesses and helping to preserve

44:42.160 --> 44:46.960
their traditions. So if you love trying new and interesting things, or if you know somebody who

44:46.960 --> 44:51.840
does, you have got to try out Bokksu and get these snacks shipped straight from Japan to your door.

44:51.840 --> 44:57.680
And right now you can use the code FACTUALLY for $15 off your first order on Bokksu.com. That's

44:57.680 --> 45:05.200
code FACTUALLY for $15 off your first order on Bokksu.com. That's B-O-K-K-S-U.com. I want to return

45:05.200 --> 45:12.320
to this point of climate shocks, you said, is going to mobilize people. Because you said, actually,

45:12.320 --> 45:15.280
let's return to something even earlier. And I didn't even, and I didn't finish talking about

45:15.280 --> 45:20.160
what I found. You dropped so many ideas on us. We're going to go through them one by one day.

45:21.120 --> 45:26.800
Because this is, you're an incredible interviewee. So you talked about organizations. Organizations

45:26.800 --> 45:31.120
are really important to get people, you know, mobilized to make things happen. Something I've

45:31.120 --> 45:35.600
talked about before in my work that my wonderful research producer, Sam Roundman, is constantly

45:35.600 --> 45:41.360
reminding me. The reason that NRA is very powerful is not actually the gun lobby's money. It's the

45:41.360 --> 45:46.400
fact that it's a mass, I mean, the lobby, the money is important, right? But is it's a mass

45:46.400 --> 45:51.200
membership organization that like millions of people are members and they actually get something

45:51.200 --> 45:55.600
out of the membership. They take firearms training. They, you know, whatever, they get a discount at

45:55.600 --> 45:59.840
the local gun store. And they make friends. I mean, that's the other thing is it's not just

45:59.920 --> 46:05.120
that they get something out of it, but it creates social bonds and that builds reciprocity so that

46:05.120 --> 46:12.000
if they're like, Hey, the library wants to have this, you know, book, you should do something. Oh,

46:12.000 --> 46:16.320
yeah, I'm going to come out because it's a real membership organization that people feel like

46:16.320 --> 46:20.720
they're a part of. That's also part of why in my own personal experience, unions are so powerful

46:20.720 --> 46:26.240
because it is, it's an organization that actually matters to your life. It's about your workplace.

46:26.240 --> 46:31.200
It's your workplace connections. You can, you know, exercise power and really feel it. It like

46:31.200 --> 46:34.720
is really vital in your life. Churches are really important to people for those reasons.

46:34.720 --> 46:40.800
The social bonds, I think some of the problem with organizations like a 350.org like, Hey,

46:40.800 --> 46:43.840
why don't you join the climate movement and, you know, come to a thing is it's like,

46:43.840 --> 46:49.360
what immediate relevance does that have to people in their lives? Right? Okay. I signed up for a

46:49.360 --> 46:54.000
mailing list. You know, maybe they send me some mailers and stuff like that, but it is lacking

46:54.000 --> 47:00.000
that like immediacy of this is an organization that I am a part of and that it interacts with my

47:00.000 --> 47:07.280
life in multiple ways. So one of the things that I talk about a lot in my last book in American

47:07.280 --> 47:12.960
Resistance is the way that there has been this shift in the past like decade or so as social

47:12.960 --> 47:18.560
media and technology has diffused more, where a lot of organizations decided, particularly on the

47:18.560 --> 47:22.560
left, decided to do the shortcut where they no longer have members, but they have email lists,

47:22.560 --> 47:28.320
right? And as a result, individuals will be, you know, members or connected to many different

47:28.320 --> 47:32.960
organizations simultaneously, because it's a very easy ask, but they don't get anything out of it.

47:32.960 --> 47:39.200
They don't meet in person. They don't actually feel any bonds to anybody else. And I actually in

47:39.200 --> 47:44.000
my last book, I talked about how I am, my sister and I went and volunteered with Swing Left during

47:44.000 --> 47:48.320
the 2018 election. That was like the last chapter of the book where we went out and we decided we

47:48.320 --> 47:53.040
were going to go to, you know, an area in Virginia and we were going to like see, I was like, let's

47:53.040 --> 47:56.800
experience this, how this is working, because this was like a big resistance group they'd

47:56.800 --> 48:01.600
emerge during the Trump administration to try to push back and to try to help take power back.

48:01.600 --> 48:05.760
And so I was like, okay, so my sister and I decided we would do it together. And we went there and

48:06.400 --> 48:10.320
while we ended up meeting Terry McAuliffe, who was the former governor and actually ended up

48:10.320 --> 48:15.440
running for governor, but did not win in Virginia. So we got to meet him and have a conversation with

48:15.440 --> 48:21.360
him. We met nobody else the entire time that we did our work with this organization. And we walked

48:21.360 --> 48:25.840
away having done stuff. I got one email saying, Hey, you guys knocked on this many doors this day.

48:26.400 --> 48:29.760
And it was amazing because it was like, it was, it was crazy because people were like blocking

48:29.760 --> 48:35.120
the street parking to do this in this one area of Virginia to work on this election. But nobody

48:35.120 --> 48:41.200
met anybody. So I felt no contact, no connection to this organization afterwards. There's no

48:41.200 --> 48:45.760
reciprocity there. What if they had at the end of that said, Hey, let's go out for beers. Hey,

48:45.760 --> 48:49.520
the here's Pete, you know, and then you make friends, like, which is something that I've

48:49.520 --> 48:53.360
experienced in the labor movement, right, that, that I have, I have new friends and new colleagues,

48:53.360 --> 48:57.440
right? You know, I'm literally going to go to a labor conference later this year because I want

48:57.440 --> 49:02.240
to meet more people, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, I would say that it's, it's also valuable, like

49:02.240 --> 49:05.600
in a you and people are very connected because it's connected to your work and to your life.

49:05.600 --> 49:10.400
Exactly. And one of the things that a lot of people have asked me out of the new book is I talk about

49:10.480 --> 49:15.680
how we create social reciprocity and how we create resilience in our communities,

49:15.680 --> 49:19.120
which is absolutely necessary, right? And so when we think about climate change, and I know

49:19.120 --> 49:22.000
we're going to talk about climate shocks in a minute, but when we think about climate change,

49:22.000 --> 49:25.760
we know that communities are going to be hit with extreme events, right? Which we call,

49:25.760 --> 49:30.960
which I call climate shocks. But we need to address them in terms of thinking about how we

49:30.960 --> 49:35.360
environmentally prepare, but we also need to socially prepare. And that's where these kinds

49:35.440 --> 49:40.560
of organizations can also play a very important role because as you get hit with an extreme,

49:40.560 --> 49:47.920
like an atmospheric river here or a tornado or a hurricane or a drought or a flood or, you know,

49:47.920 --> 49:52.800
the list goes on and on and on. Unfortunately, the communities are going to have to respond

49:52.800 --> 49:57.520
and having those connections matter a lot. And one of the things that I've been thinking about,

49:57.520 --> 50:00.640
and a lot of people have been asking me is where do we get those connections? Because we have many

50:00.640 --> 50:05.200
fewer of them on the left, which is what you were pointing out originally. And so we, we know

50:05.600 --> 50:10.880
churches, we know other religious groups, we know schools provide that. I mean, certainly

50:10.880 --> 50:16.080
one of the ways that Sunrise was so successful is by building hubs within schools. But another

50:16.080 --> 50:19.520
place, and this is something that I'm actually starting to do research on and work with in my

50:19.520 --> 50:25.120
team at American University, is we're looking at libraries. Libraries are in communities around,

50:26.320 --> 50:29.760
in all communities, right? Everybody has a library or almost everybody has a library,

50:29.760 --> 50:34.800
thankfully. And they provide information and access to books and knowledge, right? And they

50:34.880 --> 50:38.880
could also provide a lot of other things. For example, I mean, I'm assuming here in California,

50:38.880 --> 50:45.120
too, libraries help to distribute COVID test kits, right? And they provided a lot of other

50:45.120 --> 50:49.440
resources. They provide a lot of social services. Exactly. And they could provide even more. And

50:49.440 --> 50:54.240
in fact, one of the things that we're looking into is the way that they might be able to provide

50:54.240 --> 50:59.040
information around climate change that is relevant for specific communities based on what

50:59.040 --> 51:03.120
the demographics or the community are, as well as the kinds of risks that they're facing.

51:03.920 --> 51:10.960
When you talk about these shocks causing, okay, these organizations to grow and maybe

51:11.600 --> 51:17.200
have a closer relationship with the public, which is what we need. We need climate organizations

51:17.200 --> 51:24.480
that people feel connected to in a more real way so that they can actually ask something of people,

51:24.480 --> 51:27.680
hey, show up and do something. And people go, hell, yeah, I will, because I'm a member of this

51:27.680 --> 51:37.360
organization. A climate shock, I can see how that might help that happen. Because if your town is

51:37.360 --> 51:42.080
flooding, it's suddenly realer to you and you need the help of an organization more. Maybe you'll

51:42.080 --> 51:46.640
get more involved in the same way that when if you're being fucked over at work and a union

51:46.640 --> 51:50.800
comes to your workplace, you'll feel like you're a member of that union. That's really real. However,

51:51.520 --> 51:54.960
if the shocks are happening, doesn't that mean it's kind of late?

51:55.600 --> 52:02.720
No, it is a very late hour already for climate change and for the world. And as a result,

52:02.720 --> 52:07.440
there's no question that people are going to lose lives and people are going to lose homes.

52:07.440 --> 52:11.680
I mean, we're already seeing it. I mean, insurance companies are pulling out of parts of

52:11.680 --> 52:15.760
all over the United States. And then that doesn't even consider developing countries which have

52:15.760 --> 52:19.760
contributed the least to the climate crisis, but they're being hit even more and they have much

52:19.760 --> 52:25.920
less social support. Certain small island nations are flooding. Australia is taking in people who

52:25.920 --> 52:30.880
are climate refugees basically. And that's going to happen more and more. But so it is a very late

52:30.880 --> 52:36.480
hour, but it's not too late for most of us to save ourselves. And that's why I start in the

52:36.480 --> 52:40.560
beginning of the book by saying, I hope to see you all on the other side. Because as much as it

52:40.560 --> 52:45.600
sounds kind of glib, I mean, it's absolutely true and we are not taking seriously the threat.

52:45.600 --> 52:49.040
And that's one of the reasons that a lot of climate scientists I know are starting, these are like

52:49.040 --> 52:52.400
the natural scientists, the atmospheric scientists are becoming activists because they're like,

52:52.400 --> 52:56.080
we're done doing research. We're going to scream at the top of our lungs because what the hell else

52:56.080 --> 53:01.520
are we going to do? You guys have to listen to us. But nobody's listening to the dire message

53:01.520 --> 53:06.000
coming from the scientists. But so with regard to climate shocks, what I think is really important

53:06.000 --> 53:10.880
to recognize is that there's a lot of research that talks about how after disasters, windows of

53:10.880 --> 53:16.960
opportunity open. And we can see it after Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Sandy. I

53:16.960 --> 53:21.360
mean, I know a lot of my examples are hurricanes after the wildfires that hit here in California.

53:21.360 --> 53:28.240
There are these moments where all of a sudden people can do things and policy making shifts

53:28.240 --> 53:34.000
a lot. And this is what I call an anthro shift in the book. And in that moment, what we see is

53:35.760 --> 53:40.560
the social system shift to be able to support people because they know that the people need

53:40.560 --> 53:51.040
the help. And that is when we can see the types of systemic changes that are so needed

53:51.040 --> 53:56.480
actually happening. Unfortunately, at this point, we don't have examples of that kind of lasting

53:56.480 --> 54:01.200
change. And I talk in the book a lot about the example of the pandemic and the way that all of

54:01.200 --> 54:06.400
a sudden, when people started feeling the risk themselves, like the risk, oh my gosh, I could

54:06.480 --> 54:10.880
die. My kids could die. I could pass on this deadly disease to somebody older in my family.

54:11.440 --> 54:16.800
People supported the idea that the world shut down. We stayed home. We homeschooled, which

54:16.800 --> 54:22.400
was really fun. We baked bread. We created gardens. We did all of these things at home.

54:22.400 --> 54:27.600
We stayed inside for a long time. We wore masks. And people got mad after a while, but especially

54:27.600 --> 54:32.640
for the first couple of months, people were really on board. People were vigilant. And our

54:32.640 --> 54:40.400
government changed. It supported us. It gave out more resources. It gave loans. It stopped people

54:40.400 --> 54:46.720
from getting evicted. It did all of these things. That was an anthra shift. But over time, when the

54:46.720 --> 54:51.440
risk level went down and people started being like, oh, I already got it. Wasn't that big deal? Or I

54:51.440 --> 54:58.320
got vaccinated? Or it's not worth this? They went back out and we're basically back to normal.

54:58.320 --> 55:02.160
And I frequently, when I talk about this, and I'm doing my book tour now and I'm talking to

55:02.160 --> 55:06.400
crowds and I'm like, and I see zero people in the audience wearing a mask, even though the pandemic

55:06.400 --> 55:11.680
continues, right? That shows that the shift, we went back. It's multi-directional and we can go

55:11.680 --> 55:16.160
back. And that tells us how bad it has to get before we're really going to mobilize. I mean,

55:16.160 --> 55:21.120
one of the hopeful things just going back to my surveying people in the crowd, back to sociology

55:21.120 --> 55:26.160
for a moment. So I surveyed all of these activists in the streets in New York City, 75,000 people in

55:26.160 --> 55:31.680
September last year. And I asked them for the first time I asked, one, did you experience a

55:31.680 --> 55:34.800
climate shock? And I didn't say climate shock. I listed a whole bunch of things that we know are

55:34.800 --> 55:40.160
climate shocks. Wildfire and smoke from wildfire, extreme weather, extreme events, sea level rise,

55:40.160 --> 55:46.960
flooding, right? And what was amazing is over 85% of the people in the crowd reported experiencing

55:46.960 --> 55:51.840
at least one climate shock in the past six months. Wow. I mean, in a lot of it, so we were on the

55:51.840 --> 55:56.640
East Coast, a lot of it was wildfire and smoke from wildfire, but also sea level rise, flooding,

55:56.640 --> 56:02.240
and extreme heat, right? So this is, I mean, so the people who are mobilizing are experiencing

56:02.240 --> 56:07.280
climate shocks. And the other thing that I asked them is there's been a lot of talk about emotions

56:07.280 --> 56:12.720
and people feeling like climate anxiety or feeling so despondent from the crisis that

56:12.720 --> 56:16.160
they're not doing anything. And so one of the things I wanted to do is see what people in the

56:16.160 --> 56:20.640
streets were feeling, what is motivating them to get out in the streets and get off their sofas,

56:20.640 --> 56:29.440
right? And the top emotions for people in the crowd were sadness, makes sense, right? And anger.

56:29.440 --> 56:32.880
No hope. People in the streets were not particularly hopeful. They were there because

56:32.880 --> 56:37.520
they were pissed off. Yeah. And there is like historical precedent that we know that people

56:37.520 --> 56:42.480
who join social movements and like are willing to take a stand, they usually are angry. So,

56:42.480 --> 56:48.720
you know, come to think of it, hope, especially in the Obama era, got such a big, big reputation.

56:48.720 --> 56:52.240
Oh, hope, hope. That's why we're out there. Well, hold on a second. If you have hope,

56:52.240 --> 56:55.040
maybe you'll just sit at home and be like, yeah, hope things will get better. Like,

56:56.160 --> 56:58.240
things will probably turn around. Exactly.

56:58.240 --> 57:02.400
Don't worry about it. But if you're pissed off, you might take to the streets and like,

57:02.400 --> 57:04.880
you know, start shaking your fist and throwing things.

57:04.880 --> 57:08.480
Absolutely. And you might be willing to glue yourself or get arrested, right? I mean,

57:08.480 --> 57:14.160
a good piece of evidence on that point is that while we did the survey in the streets,

57:14.160 --> 57:18.240
I also worked with a team of folks who did a nationally representative sample of people who

57:18.240 --> 57:23.040
were not in the streets at the same time to see how much they experienced climate shocks

57:23.040 --> 57:29.440
and what emotions they were feeling. And so they had a lot less experience personally with climate

57:29.440 --> 57:36.960
shocks and they were hopeful about the climate change. So people who were not in the streets

57:36.960 --> 57:43.440
are hopeful and less angry and people who are in the streets less hopeful, angry, but they're there.

57:43.440 --> 57:52.080
That is so fascinating because I have taken as a thesis for a long time that, look, there's such

57:52.080 --> 57:58.480
a vibe out there of the world is ending, right? It's all over. If you scroll on TikTok, you'll

57:58.480 --> 58:03.920
see a lot of people who feel that way. Well, hey, this is the, I'm a member of the last generation.

58:03.920 --> 58:09.280
So why even bother? And I always sort of took it as a given that part of, you know,

58:09.280 --> 58:14.880
what I should try to do is let people know that there's always going to be a world tomorrow

58:14.880 --> 58:19.600
and you always have the opportunity to make a better tomorrow and shit is being done and you

58:19.600 --> 58:26.000
can be a part of that and to try to fight against defeatism, which I think is part of hope and to

58:26.000 --> 58:31.040
try to cultivate a bit of hope. Things are really bad. I want us to be real realists, but hey,

58:31.040 --> 58:36.720
if we can do it, what you are maybe saying is that maybe that's the wrong approach. Maybe we

58:36.720 --> 58:42.080
should just say, nah, shit's fucked. Get mad. Get out there. I don't think that they're that

58:42.080 --> 58:45.760
different. I mean, I actually, because I actually think when I hear you talking about it, I mean,

58:45.760 --> 58:50.160
like you kind of sound like an apocalyptic optimist too, right? I mean, I mean, it's basically,

58:50.160 --> 58:54.960
that's the realistic stance, right? Is that, I mean, if you want to be realistic about the climate

58:54.960 --> 58:59.200
crisis, you need to acknowledge what the natural scientists are saying. I mean, I'm not a natural

58:59.200 --> 59:04.480
scientist. I'm not an atmospheric scientist. We got a lot of my colleagues who are who are saying,

59:04.480 --> 59:09.280
we are standing at the precipice and we are looking into it. And some of us are saying,

59:09.280 --> 59:13.920
who cares? And others of us are saying, holy shit, I mean, and those people are doing something

59:13.920 --> 59:19.360
about it. And in, you know, in the case of the general public, I think it's important to recognize

59:19.360 --> 59:24.960
that so that when we hit like summer 2024 is going to suck. It is going to suck across the

59:24.960 --> 59:29.520
country. And anybody who says differently, and then it's going to go into fall 2024,

59:29.520 --> 59:34.880
and they are predicting the worst hurricane, the worst hurricane season ever. I mean, and the

59:34.880 --> 59:39.920
only, I mean, if anybody is wondering about why we know that, look at the temperature, ocean

59:39.920 --> 59:44.960
temperatures now, ocean temperatures are statistically significantly off the charts

59:44.960 --> 59:49.600
from any historical record. And that, and that leads to hurricanes, right?

59:49.600 --> 59:52.880
Because the energy in the ocean, that leads to energy in the storm system.

59:52.880 --> 59:56.640
Yeah. I mean, basically the storms like suck up the water and the warmer the water is,

59:56.640 --> 01:00:02.160
the more water they suck up. And so while the hurricanes, the wind may not be any stronger,

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.840
it is not the wind that destroys homes and destroys communities. It is how much rain falls.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.120
I mean, you guys know that here, right? It's all about rainfall and how much

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.200
your land can actually absorb, right? And that, and that is going to be

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:19.920
absolutely decimating this coming year. So we need to be realistic about that, right? And I,

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.520
I mean, I don't do that research, but I believe my colleagues who do do that research.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.280
And so the question is, what do we do about it? And I do think we should be hopeful. I mean,

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.320
I'm hopeful, but the reason I'm hopeful is because I'm angry. And because I know so many people are

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.960
angry. And I think that people should not sit with it and be like, you know, you should be like,

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.040
wow, this sucks. And it's getting worse. But they, but we should also think,

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.120
and fuck it, I'm going to do something about it. And, and that's what everybody needs to do.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:50.320
People need to rise up and they need to, they need to embrace the anchor and embrace the fact that

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.600
this is not fair. And it is not fair that it is our responsibility to do something about it. The

01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.720
only way that our government will do what is needed is if we demand it and we force them to.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.640
Otherwise, we will continue on this incremental path to policy making that will do something,

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.440
but absolutely not enough to address the climate crisis. And basically, you may as well kiss like

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.120
half of Florida goodbye. You may as well kiss most of the coast, you know, goodbye. And anybody who

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:22.640
lives in areas that get extreme heat, like, you know, the whole Southwest, anybody who works

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.760
outside there, anybody who can't afford to have air conditioning, they'll be moving. And, you know,

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.720
then we're going to be experiencing not just internal migration, but, you know, within the

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.640
United States, but we're going to be seeing all these people from other parts of the world who

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:41.920
can't, you know, can't live where they are, who have, you know, no access to water. It's too hot.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:46.240
They can't survive. And they're going to be pushing in. And of course, that makes for a really fun

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.880
story because, as we know, we're not doing so well with migration already. Now imagine all the

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.920
people who are going to be coming. And the political strife that will come as a result

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:59.840
when people freak out about that and the humanitarian crisis that will happen. And my God.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:09.120
But don't get despondent. Get angry. That's a great message. I, I, no, no, seriously,

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:14.320
I'm the angry sociologist. That's a wonderful, it's a wonderful message and a wonderful speech

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:22.400
that you gave. I hope you could speak to my own darkest thought, which is that, you know, on some

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:29.600
level humanity, like our social technology, our social ability to recognize what's happening as a

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:37.440
system of humans. And honestly, our individual ability to do so is sort of outstripped by what is

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.480
happening. You know, I, something that stuck with me for a long time, I read this maybe a year ago.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.160
Can't remember whose blog post this was. So apologies to the blogger who wrote this,

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:52.640
but it was that, you know, Obama had bought a beachfront home on Martha's, Martha's Village.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.600
Martha's Vineyard. Martha's Vineyard. Thank you, the island, right? That he loves so much.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.880
You are a west coaster. No, no, no, I'm not a prop. No, I grew up in New York, goddammit,

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.640
but I just forgot what it was. Oh, I have a tan now. Okay, fuck it. I mean, I live in California.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.440
Anyway, so he had bought a, he had bought a house on Martha's Vineyard and whatever

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:16.880
reporter or blogger this was looked up like, you know, the government's climate change predictions.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.320
It was like, this house is going to be unlivable or unsellable inside of 20 years, right? That this

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:28.800
is like a terrible investment. Forget livable. It's a bad investment. And literally, I know people,

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.480
I grew up on Long Island, I know people who have had that problem where it's like their house has

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.320
gone down in value because, you know, it's so close to the coast that people don't want to buy it

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.920
because they know about climate change. After Hurricane Sandy, there were communities that had

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:46.240
to be relocated. I mean, yeah. So the point of this piece was that Barack Obama, who certainly

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.880
should be in a better position than anyone else to know about climate change, very smart man reads

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:56.400
a giant briefing book every weekend, you know, he's not ignorant of the problem. And yet when it came

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:04.240
to his own personal choice, he made a choice that was ignorant because our own ability to sort of

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:10.160
see the future in this case and think about how it affects us is limited, right? It's like a human

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.000
limitation. And I could list, I don't want to just be like, Obama's a piece of shit. That's not the

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.560
point. The point is that like all of us do this to an extent, right? Like we have trouble

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:25.040
thinking about the future in this way and making adjustments in our lives and then multiply that

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.400
by, you know, eight billion. And, you know, you've got a real motherfucker of a problem. And this is

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.000
just going to be something we're 200 years from now. The remnants of humanity are looking back

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.760
going. This was just outstripped our ability to do something as a species.

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.040
Okay. So first and foremost, yes, I think there is a real risk of that. But second, I do want to,

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.800
I want to talk about the Obama issue and the example for a second to just say that, well,

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.880
well, Obama should have known better. However, he is, I mean, he's a super privileged man, right?

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.760
He's a former president of the United States. He has lots of resources. His, you know,

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.960
Michelle has made a lot of money on selling books, right? So they are not suffering at all. Okay.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:09.680
So they can afford it. I mean, the people who can afford it, I mean, they may take a loss.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.720
They can afford to take a loss. And at this point, I mean, it's unclear what will happen with insurance

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:18.720
on Martha's Vineyard and in, you know, in Massachusetts. If they were in Florida,

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.520
they would no longer have insurance. And you know what? Someone's going to buy this house,

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.640
even if it's like floating in the ocean. Someone's going to be like, you know,

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.120
President Obama used to live there. Someone's going to pay too much for it.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.840
I mean, what maybe, but I mean, what's happening right now is that there are certain communities

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:36.080
and there was this really interesting story that was done in Washington Post recently about

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:42.000
communities in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where there were the summer houses that basically

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.560
had, you know, where Outer Banks are like these border islands, right? And they had been

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:52.960
so taken over by sea level rise that they basically were no longer able to get access to

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.040
water, sewage or electricity, right? Because that all came underground and all got washed away.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:03.520
So the National Park Service paid the owners, and I believe it was $800,000 a house

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.280
to take them back and demolish them. Wow.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:12.400
Which is, that's just like, that's not sustainable. It's outrageous a little bit. And you know,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.440
and those people like, I know they took a loss, but you know, hey, that's not so bad. I mean,

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.800
we should all hope that we get that kind of bailout. That's not, we should not expect that to

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.680
happen. But so, I mean, so I would just say like, I think, you know, those people who can afford

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.640
summer homes and stuff like that, and I mean, more and more, they're going to buy homes without

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.720
being able to get insurance because that's what's happening is the insurance companies are on the

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.720
forefront or the Vanguard in terms of thinking about this because it's their pocketbook that's

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.920
going back to cover. And the people in that position of privilege are the ones who are calling the

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:48.240
shots. They're the ones who are running the oil companies. They're the ones who are senators and

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:52.400
et cetera, right? Right. I mean, for now, I mean, the nice, you know, that's one of the things that's

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:58.800
nice about our country is you could actually run for office and hold office and not come from like

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:05.040
oil companies. But you know, people have to, but it's much more difficult. I saw a stat recently

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:10.240
from, I believe, more Perfect Union that like a very small percentage of people in office are from

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.000
working class backgrounds. Most of them are well paid lawyers and things like that. They're from

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.360
the upper crust. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let me share. So those, I mean, and those people are

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.840
going to have the least, they're the least at risk from the climate crisis, right? They are not part

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:26.560
of frontline communities. They are not, most of them don't come from communities of color either.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:32.560
And that means that they have like some distance from experiencing this. But I mean, but I think

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:37.040
that the other point that you made in this, the example around Obama that I think is really important

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:43.600
to think about is that because of the way climate change works, which is right right now, we emit

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.320
CO2, carbon greenhouse gases, they go into the atmosphere and they build up there.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:52.800
And it is the process of them getting up there and sitting up there that then affects

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.560
thermal radiation coming from the sun and how much actually gets back out. And that's,

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.120
that's the greenhouse effect, right? That's how it works. And that then has this effect on all

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.440
these patterns, et cetera, that the natural scientists are talking about. It is a slow process,

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:10.400
right? We know, for example, if tomorrow everybody stopped burning fossil fuels and

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.840
everybody, you know, everybody just turned off the lights, we would not see an effect in terms of

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.960
all of the effects of climate change. The climate shocks would not stop immediately.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:26.320
So given that delay, it makes it even harder. Not only is that we've got these folks in positions

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.360
of power who are controlling all the resources that are making decisions, making slow, but it's

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:36.560
also that it's like a, it's, there's a delay there. And that means that this is such a tricky problem

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.520
that there is just no question in my mind that we are going to have to get a lot more apocalyptic

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.960
before we're going to get to the optimistic side. Because we need people to experience this first

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:52.320
hand to get angry enough to make those kinds of decisions to change their behaviors. And a lot

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:56.720
of those decisions and those changes, they're not going to be fun. I mean, some people will be able

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:02.000
to buy a Rivian. Congratulations to you, right? But most people were talking about having to

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.680
take public transit and hope that it becomes electrified. And that is, you know, having tried,

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.160
right, like, you know, having tried to get around on public transit here in LA, I can tell you,

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.280
it sucks. I do it every day. Oh, well, it's, it's, look, if you, if you plan it that way, right,

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:21.360
you plan it that way. I plan it that way. I've, I've molded my life around public transit in LA

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:26.320
and go to, go to a major city in Texas and tell me that public transit in LA sucks. Like, at least

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:31.440
we fucking have it here. I'm, I'm serious. Like, like Los Angeles has second highest public transit

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:37.280
ridership in the country, because, because there are buses, a lot of cities in America do not have

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:43.360
them at all. But, you know, I saw speed. I know about the buses. Well taken that like you, it is,

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:50.080
the system is simultaneously, you know, to, to spread out buses run too rarely, too uncomfortable,

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:54.160
not enough shade, speaking of climate change, you know, there are all these problems with the

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:58.080
system. And they're not electric. Yeah. And they're not electric. Makes it far more uncomfortable

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.120
and unpleasant and inconvenient to ride than it should be, despite the fact that it's a better

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:10.800
option than many, than many people, you know, in this city think that it is. But so you, but it

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:16.880
almost seems like you end up not rooting for the shocks, but saying like, Hey, things are going to

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:23.840
get worse. But in a way, that's a good thing because it may finally cause the societal response

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.040
that we need, where people are really fucking getting out there and getting angry and saying,

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:34.160
protect us because we are actively dying. Right. I mean, and that, but that unfortunately, that

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:39.760
process is the only way I see it working. Right. Because the government's not going to step in

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.920
and save us because they're basically going to lose, I mean, the folks in power are going to lose

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.160
those funders who fund their campaigns. And that's how our political system works, unfortunately.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.160
But that is how the system works, right? So that's not going to change. The business is,

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.680
some of the businesses are going to push for clean energy, but a whole bunch of businesses

01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:00.320
are going to say, Hey, we can, maybe we can extract a more natural gas and send it to other

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:05.120
countries and make money on that. So they're going to do anything they can to stay, stay the

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:10.160
course. So systemic change is hard. We're going to have to push for it. And it is true that we're

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:15.200
going to need to have, I mean, I'm not rooting for climate shocks. I am being just realistic

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.760
about what's coming. I mean, I just hope there are some people, some scholars who are talking

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:24.960
about these like cascading effects and not knowing how it's going to have huge effects on

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:31.120
in terms of thinking about how weather patterns will change, how the different ocean currents

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.480
will change. And I mean, this is all people who do stuff that I do not do and I don't know a lot

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:42.080
about, but I read when I see the story, the pieces come out in top journals, those things could really

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:48.320
change the whole way that weather and temperature and climate works all over the world. And we don't

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:54.080
know. I mean, it could mean like droughts happen in places that never were dry before and floods,

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.000
you know, and places are inundated in ways that were never before. But we should expect that

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.880
these kinds of things are coming. So I just, my feeling is we just should take whatever is

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:08.720
predicted and assume that it could be as bad as that. And we can hope it won't be. But that is

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:13.120
where people are going to start to get angry because it's when you have the personal experience

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:21.440
of the risk that gets us mad and gets us motivated. And then we work through the organizations that

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.960
exist or build our own organizations to put pressure on those in power. And it's only when

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:31.680
those in power actually feel at risk of losing power that they finally make a difference.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.400
And they make the changes that are needed. And that means we learn this from the civil

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:40.080
rights movement. Those are perfect examples there. I mean, you actually are giving me hope that

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:46.960
it's weird. You give me a weird kind of hope that like as things get worse, that creates the

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:53.280
conditions for things to get better, that there's a natural sort of countervailing force. And that

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:57.120
honestly sounds more plausible to me than like, Hey, you know, the price of solar is going to get

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.640
so cheap that eventually the problem is going to solve itself. Like I can, I can hold that a

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.800
little bit of hope there too. But also, you know, I think things are getting a little bit worse.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:11.040
But the idea that that is going to, you know, cause change and cause a mass uprising of the

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:17.280
sort that we need is believable. And it seems to be, you know, born out by history that, you know,

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:23.520
it's when people are under the most intense pressure that I mean, look at the labor movement,

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:29.760
right? That like the labor movement was born out of the incredible depravity of the late 19th

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:36.080
century, right? The incredible misery forced people to stand up and fight back. And then,

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:40.080
you know, we, the labor movement worked and, you know, in, you know, starting in the middle

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:44.160
part of the century or the last century, we had the rise of the middle class and like safety

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.800
protections and the 40 hour work week and all these things. And then everybody got comfy and

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.040
the company started fucking everybody again. And now people are rising up again. Like this is

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.640
kind of how it works a little bit. And so, you know, we're starting to have the fact that the

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.880
climate crisis is actually happening, is waking people up perhaps.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.400
Well, yeah, certainly. I mean, there's no question that the labor movement is also

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:13.200
reemerging after recognizing how the extension and expansion of inequality in our country is

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.520
basically leaving so many people behind, right? So that's happening simultaneous.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.000
And one of the things that simultaneously, one of the things I talk about in the book, though,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.360
is that historically, labor and the climate movement have not worked well together. I mean,

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.000
and in fact, part of that is because much of the clean energy transition so far has been

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.120
peopled by non-union labor. And that means that folks in unions are like, no, no, no, no, no,

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.960
we would like to stick with our fossil fuel expansion project because that is unionized.

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.320
And there have been some, I won't, I won't call them out, but there's been a couple

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.080
unions I know here in Southern California that have been like against, you know,

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.000
different climate change regulations. Hey, let's electrify. Well, hold on a second.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.160
If you work in the gas industry, maybe you don't like that so much.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:15:00.240
Of course. Of course. And that's understandable, but it is, you know, it is against, it's people

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:05.120
following their incentives as one does, but it is bad in the overall.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:10.080
The good news is things are shifting. I mean, for example, there was one,

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.320
there's one really interesting case that happened recently where so for people who build cars that

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.800
are fossil fuel burning cars, most of those factories are union labor, right?

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.200
Yeah.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.360
The folks who build the batteries for electric cars historically have not been union labor.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:28.960
And so if you want to push for more EVs, you're pushing away from using union labor.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.480
But there is, there are now efforts and there's some really good people who are working on trying

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:38.160
to, you know, work together to unionize consistently so that that is not, you know,

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.960
that is not the challenge of the worker because it's not really fair.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.320
And because that is really necessary to help to merge these movements together.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.800
And a far-sighted union leader would need to see that as I think some in the auto industry are

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.760
finally. Yeah, they're finally starting to do that. And I think that's going to continue. I mean,

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:55.520
I would just say that, you know, the other reason that we don't, we shouldn't have a lot of hope

01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:01.360
so far about the clean energy transition is that so far we've seen an expansion in consumption

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:05.440
of clean energy in the United States, thanks to a lot of federal funding from the Inflation

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.160
Reduction Act, et cetera. And the price of, you know, renewable and clean energy has gone down

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:14.800
quite a bit. But what's happened is actually our overall energy to consumption has just grown.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:15.040
Yeah.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:19.280
So we continue to still burn and consume as much fossil fuels, but more, there's more.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:26.400
The percentage is better, but the actual, a literal amount of fossil fuels being burned has

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.680
not gone down. And that's why the carbon concentrations continue to go up.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.960
So you said earlier, it was almost a good way to end the podcast, but I had more I wanted to ask

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:41.360
you. You remember before when you were like, get angry and get out there, right? How should people

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:47.680
do that? Like how should people, you know, join the movement if we would like to make sure we don't

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.600
need quite so many climate shocks before we do something, right? We want to get started early

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.440
so that we have to go through less of those. What do people do?

01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:02.560
Yeah, that's exactly the argument that I make is that the more people reclaim their power and

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:07.440
mobilize and start working together, the less climate shocks will happen and the less people

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:13.120
will lose life and lose like their livelihoods, right? Because that's basically where we're going.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:18.320
So, I mean, the book ends with three points, three things that we can all do to save ourselves.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.280
And two of them are for people who want to be activists. And one is for, you know,

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:25.280
your everyday people. So I'll just talk to the activists first. I'm first and foremost,

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:29.280
and this is actually building off of what we were just talking about. Activists need to create

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:35.520
community and true solidarity. And the solidarity needs to come across movements, across different

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.320
issues. I mean, we need to see more intersectionality. We need to see more people coming from all

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:44.960
different identities and orientations engaging in climate activism. Historically, the climate

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:49.520
movement which spun off of the environmental movement was really quite privileged. And as such,

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:54.480
we did not see a lot of people of color or people coming from working class backgrounds

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:59.360
involved in it. We still don't enough, but we need to see that happen more. And one of the things

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.760
in terms of thinking about creating community and building community within the movement,

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:09.520
I think is really interesting, is I talk about in the book a lot lessons from the civil rights

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:13.040
movement. And one of the things, and I talk a lot in the book about kind of this growing radical

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.080
flank of folks who are starting to be more aggressive, even though it's like air quote

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:23.680
aggressive at this point, in that they're being confrontational, throwing soup on plastic covers

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:28.160
and, you know, gluing themselves to things or disrupting the US Open and then getting

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:32.320
carted away in the US Open continues, right? So I mean, sure, it's a nuisance, but we're

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.880
not talking like this isn't radical like the suffragettes who blew up like a building a month

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.640
the height of women's suffrage, you know, the struggle for women's suffrage. So,

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:45.200
you know, it's still quite tame radical. But when we talk about the radical flank, like everybody

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.640
doesn't have to be involved in the radical flank. When we think about creating community, one of

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:52.560
the things that's a really interesting lesson from the civil rights movement is that during the

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.960
civil rights struggle, a radical flank also emerged, right, where people were becoming more

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:01.680
confrontational and they engaged in sit-ins and they engaged in, you know, the blockades and,

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:05.200
you know, it continues from there. Everybody probably knows some of the stories about that.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:10.320
But what's very interesting about it is that the, as a radical flank, which was mostly young

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:15.280
people during the civil rights period, emerged, a lot of the elders who were active in the movement

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:20.160
were not happy with this. These young people who were starting to be more radical, breaking laws,

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:24.000
they were, you know, risking themselves also because, you know, there was a lot of racism

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.120
in our country. Even then there was racism, right? Let me say that differently. Back then,

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.360
there was racism, but it's worth noting that, you know, racism continues today in our country.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:41.360
But so even though the elders were not happy with this, the Black churches created a home for

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.920
these activists and created a space for them to organize and created resources to bail people

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:51.520
out of jail, et cetera. And it is that kind of community that created support and this kind

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:56.000
of organizational infrastructure for activists, no matter whether they were being, you know,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.240
doing more legally oriented work and focusing on trying to get the vote through institutional

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.440
channels or they were out in the streets causing, you know, good trouble, right?

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.520
That's what people call a diversity of tactics, right? And there was solidarity between all the

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:14.080
people who were pursuing the, hey, I don't know if I like you, what you were doing, but you know

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:17.360
what? I'll bail you out of jail or I'll make sure we're on the same side still.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.960
They were on the same side. I mean, they were still like the solidarity was, there was solidarity,

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:25.040
but they argued. I mean, certainly, and there were factions and they didn't agree all the time.

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.640
And, you know, and they didn't, you know, everybody had their opinion, right? So it was,

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:35.120
it was an uncomfortable coalition to some degree, but it was also all rooted in the Black community

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:40.560
and within the Black churches. And so they really had a lot more organizational infrastructure

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:45.200
than the groups do today. And as we were talking about, that is really necessary and important.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:49.040
So building that through community and solidarity is valuable. That was number one.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:55.520
Number two is taking advantage of moral shocks and capitalizing on violence against activists.

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.880
And this is really, we haven't talked that much about civil disobedience.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.200
Civil disobedience is becoming a more common tactic among activists. I mean,

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:09.920
well, I'm going to just say like everybody has heard of Greta Thunberg and Greta just got arrested

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.440
again in the Netherlands last week. She is a perfect example. And I talk about her quite a bit

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:21.600
in the book because she started out doing this very kind of very, you know, simple tactic where

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.840
she was just sitting on the parliament steps, right, holding her sign and skipping school,

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:30.240
right? It was not confrontational. And she has become increasingly confrontational and she has

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.400
basically become part of the radical flank of the climate movement. So her personal trajectory is

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:39.040
like a really good example because we're seeing that for activists around the country and around

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:44.400
the world, right? But what's interesting is that many people then say, oh, these activists,

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.920
they're going to get violent. There's very little reason to believe they're going to get violent.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:51.760
What is much more likely, and I talk at length about this in the book, is that people are going

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:56.640
to get violent against them. They are going to be repressed by law enforcement. I mean,

01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.000
we're seeing that, we're seeing a little bit of that in the United States. We're seeing that more

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.240
and more around the world. But we also should expect that there are going to be counter movements

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.880
that will rise up and be aggressive and violent against the activists. And it is an unfortunate

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.120
reality. But it happened during the George Floyd movement, right? Exactly. Where you had the police

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:17.520
violently attacking protesters and then you had vigilantes showing up with guns and shooting people

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.640
and saying, oh, that's because the protesters are violent. Exactly. So that is, that's a

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:26.800
wonderful example. I mean, the other thing worth noting here is, and I talk in the book about

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:32.720
the moment when President Trump basically had all of these peaceful protesters tear gassed in

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:38.000
Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., for his photo opportunity. But the thing is that,

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:44.000
and this is a perfect example of how activists can capitalize on violence, is that these were

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.480
nonviolent protesters and members of the media who got tear gassed and they were, you know,

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:55.200
they were harmed physically and they drew attention to this. And the protests the next day was like

01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:00.560
twice the size. Yeah. And that is how it works, capitalizing on these moral shocks and the violence.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.840
I mean, and there are other examples from the civil rights movement where we saw, you know,

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:07.520
dogs called on activists, people beaten up, et cetera. And so for that just list goes on.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:12.080
Those are the iconic moments of that movement. Exactly. And those were the moments when people

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:18.400
who were sympathizers to the movement mobilized in solidarity. And it is those moments of solidarity.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:25.280
I mean, George Floyd, the moment when we saw the protests after George Floyd was murdered

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.680
were moments of solidarity. And one of the reasons we saw so many people, white people

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:34.080
in the crowd and people who were coming out because of their intersectional motivations

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.960
is because they were not willing to sit down after observing and witnessing an unarmed black

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:44.000
man being murdered by a policeman on social media, right? So that was like a moral shock

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:52.560
that motivated people and they got angry, right? Yeah. But so that's number two and number three.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:56.560
And finally, and this is for people who don't want to do activism. You do not have to be an

01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:01.520
activist to help us save ourselves, right? You can be just an everyday citizen. And that's the

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:06.560
final one, which is about cultivating resilience. And as I said before, when I talk about resilience,

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:11.600
this is about building our communities so that they can withstand the climate shocks that are

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:17.520
coming and come they will, right? So we know they're coming. And depending on where you live,

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:24.320
you know what you're in for, whether it is extreme heat or extreme weather, atmospheric rivers,

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:31.360
tornadoes, etc. When those things hit, first of all, we need to rebuild in ways that we can handle

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.280
that more because we know they're going to keep coming. Places that experience sea level rise,

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:39.760
you need to make sure that your community is capable of handling flooding, the kind of flooding

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.840
that's going to become regular. I mean, and hopefully the flooding that will not overpower

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:48.560
your community. But still, there are things you can do. So you need to be environmentally resilient,

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:52.800
but more importantly, I would say, we need to be socially resilient. I mean, I've been talking

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:58.160
with a lot of groups that are working on disasters and they keep telling me about how

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.160
what they basically have been funded to do mostly is what they call disaster response.

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.800
And that is like the number one thing that a disaster response is, is it's mucking and gutting,

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:15.120
which is really, really not glamorous work at all, right? Mucking and gutting out after floods,

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:21.120
after fires, etc. That is the response. But the problem is that you need to also think about the

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:26.240
recovery, right? And recovery is rebuilding in a way where your community is more resilient. And

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:30.480
when you do that, you really need people to be connected to one another so that those who get

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:36.160
on house have support. Those who need food, those who need resources, etc., those who need jobs because

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.000
their place of work no longer exists because it gets just washed away or burnt down.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.560
And so the resilience is really important. And that's something that we can all do by getting

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.200
more connected and embedded in our communities, be it through our local unions, be it through our,

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:55.200
you know, whatever religious groups there are or our schools or our libraries, right?

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.320
I mean, I love it. It's such a holistic vision of like how we can

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:06.080
save ourselves, save ourselves the title of your book. I mean, it's a huge task,

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.880
but it's like, that's all, all we can fucking do is to, is to do this. Like we have to do it.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:16.160
We have to do it. We will do it. I mean, like I'm an optimist, right? We will do it. The question is

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.640
how bad is it going to get before we do it. And hopefully it won't be too late for most of us.

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:25.200
I mean, I really believe, I believe in people power. I believe we can do it, but I believe we

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:31.840
need to all embrace the anger and get involved. I mean, people power got us here, right? Literally

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:36.640
fossil fuels are people power. It's a kind of power that we fucking came up with. We created the

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:42.000
problem. We have the power to fix it. We are the only ones who are going to fix it. And we're the,

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.120
you know, that kind of, the kind of power you're talking about is the only kind of power that's

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:50.240
ever done fucking anything. Yeah. I mean, and as, as I say, the last line of the book is actually,

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:55.120
as unfair as it seems, nobody's coming to save us. We're going to have to save ourselves.

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:59.760
And so this is, this is the opportunity, but this is the moment now where it still can really matter.

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.640
Yeah. It will matter in the end, but it'll matter more now. So.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.520
And that's such an opportunity. I mean, look, I, I'm as angry as anybody. I can't believe we have

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:14.560
to fuck, you know, Greta Thunberg going like, I'm a child. I'm a child. Like, yeah, no, we get it.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:20.160
But yet, you know, this is the position that we are in, and we can see it as an opportunity to

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:25.280
have a huge effect on the world around us by, by stepping up and doing these things.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:28.960
Absolutely. I mean, one final thing I would just say is that, you know, there are lots of young

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:35.760
people who are just angry and upset and, you know, I feel the same way that Greta did. And she did

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.840
that night, that iconic speech, right? One thing that I think is really nice to see though, is that

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.840
we see all of these, what we're calling them, like the climate elders, the climate grannies

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:49.280
who are coming out and are basically setting an example and are providing support for young

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:54.720
people and working in, you know, working with them in, you know, solidarity. We've got the,

01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:00.080
like, rocking chair rebellion. We've got all of these amazing elders who are also joining the

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:06.160
movement. So it's not all on young people. And I think we just need to, you know, support everybody

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.560
who is doing everything they can to save ourselves because it's going to take all of us.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.680
