0	5360	Hello, and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me once again as
5360	10160	I talk to an incredible expert about all the amazing things that they know that I don't know
10160	14400	and that you might not know. Both of our minds are going to get blown together. We're going to have
14400	19360	so much fun. This week, we're talking about language. You know, people are constantly
19360	24480	arguing about what the right and wrong ways to use language are as though the rules of language
24480	30960	were encoded by some grammar god from on high. But they're not. Language isn't a set of objective
30960	37600	rules like math. No, language is created, changed, and used by people. And that means it will always
37600	41760	resist our attempts to control it. There was actually a funny example of this the other year in the
41760	49040	UK. A London primary school made a bold attempt to ban slang. And by bold, I mean pointless and
49040	54800	stupid. I mean, how are you going to stop teens from beginning sentences with because, like, or
54800	60720	basically this school even tried to ban phrases like he cut his eyes at me, which I mean, come on,
60720	66160	that's not just slang. That's poetry. That sounds like Shakespeare, man. And it's a phrase, along
66160	71440	with many others that were banned that originated among marginalized people. Controlling language
71440	76000	like this seems to be more about limiting the influence of certain people rather than the words
76000	82880	themselves. And at the end of the day, it won't work. Because again, language is created by people
82880	87920	and people are irrepressible. If you set up a linguistic rule, you would better believe some
87920	92560	enterprise and kid is going to come along and break it. And when they do, they are going to use that
92560	98000	new word phrase or sentence structure to mean something new, because that is what language
98000	104000	fucking does, bro. Now, none of that stops language from being a constant culture war target from the
104000	110400	battles over ebonics in the 1990s to conflicts today over the use of supposed woke language.
110400	115920	But those battles ignore something fundamental. The way people use language reveals something
115920	121120	about them, about who they are and where they come from and what is happening in their world.
121120	126000	So instead of telling people not to use language a certain way, what if we took the opportunity
126000	131520	to learn from how they actually do use it? Well, fortunately for us, there is an entire field of
131520	136000	study that looks at the relationship between culture and language called sociolinguistics.
136000	141680	And on the show today, we, in fact, have a sociolinguist who has written a fascinating new book
141680	146080	on this very topic. Her name is Valerie Friedland, and she's a professor at the University of Nevada,
146080	150640	Reno, and the author of a new book called Like Literally Dude, arguing for the good
150640	154800	in bad English. And you are going to love this interview with her. But before we get to it,

188000	192720	let's get to my interview with Valerie Friedland. Valerie, thank you so much for being on the show.
192720	195120	Absolutely. I'm excited to be here to talk with you.
195120	198800	So you're a sociolinguist. Tell me very briefly, what does that mean?
198800	202720	Well, first of all, I am impressed with how well you pronounce that. That trips a lot of people
202720	207840	up, which is part of the reason I went for that is my title. I love language. That's how I knew,
207840	209680	that's how I know how to pronounce everything. I love it.
209680	211440	Because I know the English language front to back.
211440	214480	I love it. All right. Well, we're going to test that as we go today.
214480	216080	Okay. I would love to.
216080	220480	I'm a linguist, a theoretical linguist, which means that I study the underlying structure of
220480	226160	language, how languages form in the brain, how your articulatory structure helps get language out.
226160	231200	But my particular interest is how social triggers and these underlying linguistic
231200	237840	tendencies interact and become language changes and evolve over time. So that's why I'm a sociolinguist.
237840	242880	And so give me an example of that. Like I'm sure your book is full of them, but give me an example
242880	246320	of how that social world will affect how language evolves.
246320	250560	Oh, absolutely. So I think a really seminal example is just looking at how
251200	255120	English has come to be the modern English we speak today versus being German
256320	261440	or something more like Icelandic, which hasn't changed much since its proto-Germanic days,
261440	267120	because we all started as a different language. But its social forces that came into the history
267120	273520	of English's development that changed it from a Germanic language, almost 100% Germanic word
273520	279280	stock to a language that has only about 30% Germanic word stock, because we had wars, we had
279280	285200	invasions, we had Vikings, we had all sorts of fun stuff. But we also had class and class plays
285200	290880	a huge role in shaping language. And during the middle English period, class was seminal
290880	295120	in forming the English that we speak today. So the lower class spoke English and the upper
295120	300480	class spoke French. And whenever you have unregulated language change going on without a lot
300480	306640	of upward pressure on keeping it standard or codifying it, natural evolutionary processes
306640	311120	in language, natural cognitive processes in language take place. And they meet with that
311120	316480	social trigger of social class and social standing. And that's really what formed the modern English
316480	321040	of today. So that's a really good example of how language triggers that are always there and social
321040	325760	triggers that come into play at certain times and places, interact and create something new and
325760	330560	novel. You know, an example of this interaction with a class that I heard, and I hesitate to
330560	334080	repeat it because I worry it's like a just so story that I heard, but maybe you can correct me
334080	339120	and tell me if it's real or not, is that the reason we have different words in English for or in
339120	344640	modern American English, at least, for the animal versus the meat that comes from the animal is
344640	348800	because of that class distinction that other languages, they use the same word or many others
348800	356960	they do. But in English cow versus beef, beef is French because it was the cow is the English
356960	361840	because it was the peasants who were dealing with the animal and the lords and ladies who
361840	366640	actually ate the meat. And so we ended up with this French descended word. That's a story I
366640	370720	heard many decades ago. Is that true? It seems to match the front line that you're talking about.
370720	375840	It is true. That's a great story. Actually, you can even read about it in Ivanhoe when they talk
375840	381840	about the peasants and what they called the food and the nobility and what they called the food.
381840	388880	It was very different because English had the words for the animal. So cow and swine, for example,
388880	393920	are the English words. But French was the language of nobility and it was the language of the upper
393920	399520	class at the time. And so the words that were used when you actually served as a servant, when you
399520	406160	served that animal, you used the French word. So cow became labouf. And that is exactly why we have
406160	413280	that two faced way to call animals and meat in English today. Well, now you mentioned the idea
413280	421120	that in the absence of a pressure to standardize the language, these evolutionary things will happen.
421120	427440	But that's also a big feature of languages, especially English. I grew up being told there's
427440	432400	a right way to speak and a wrong way to speak. I used to say, I'm doing good. And my friends would
432400	437840	say, Adam, Superman does good. You're doing well. And I was like, fuck off. You're being an asshole.
440320	447200	We're used to these sort of battles in English. And so in your view, very broadly, what role does
447200	453360	that those standardization forces play? I mean, is that a beneficial effect on languages? Is it
453360	456960	something that we should leave behind? It seems like a battle that never ends.
457520	461920	Well, I think it's actually a fairly new battle, which most people don't realize. What you're talking
461920	467520	about is prescriptivism. And we seem to think prescriptivism has been around forever because
467520	472080	we learned it. And we remember our parents saying, no, it's not him and you that went to the party.
472080	480720	It's he and you that went to the party or he and I went to the party. But reality is that language
480720	485680	has evolved so much since the old English period precisely because there weren't a lot of
485680	490880	codification and standardizations that existed in the Middle English period to tell us how to speak.
490880	496800	And so it was natural evolutionary processes, natural trickulatory forces that led language to
496800	502080	where it is today. And it really wasn't until about the 18th century that we had people that were
502080	506240	like, wow, you know, I like the way I say this better than the way you say it. So let me write it
506240	510640	down. And now everybody's going to say it this way. So these prescriptivist tendencies, these
510640	516400	grammar books, these dictionaries really didn't start being written until about 1700. And that's
516400	522640	where we get this really strong complaint tradition. It's starting about that era where you don't do
522640	527280	it right, but I do it right. And you should do it like me. I think the big question is not whether
527280	533520	one opinion is right and one is wrong, but can they coexist? And we understand where these two
533520	538800	different beliefs about language stem from and what their purpose might be. So a prescriptivist
538800	544800	might say, you should say it this way, because first of all, that's how people in power say it.
544800	549600	And if you want to achieve that kind of economic or political power, you should say it this way
549600	556640	because that will get you in the door. They might also say that this is tradition and tradition
556640	562880	is valuable. So there is some benefit to that kind of speech. A descriptivist or someone who just
563440	568560	language naturally evolved might say, well, almost everything you say that you think is correct today
568560	574560	was wrong at some point in time and is an evolution from some previous point. And if we didn't allow
574560	579280	language to proceed naturally, then we would still have case markers in English. We would still have
579280	583680	grammatical gender in English. We would still have plural marking on every word in English.
583680	588240	We would have strong and weak verb classes, none of which do we have today. And our language is no
588320	594320	less for for for it. In fact, we are as expressive and creative and inventive as ever,
594320	598160	so that there's nothing wrong with natural evolutionary processes. And they're more
598160	604400	authentic to speakers personalities. My answer would be, I think both are right. There are times
604400	608960	in places where prescriptivism might fit. So for example, in writing, it's probably important to
608960	614480	have codification standardization. And even in more formal speaking contexts where I'm giving a
614480	619440	talk or I'm a CEO of a company and I am in a leadership position and I want to make sure
619440	625520	everybody understands me and that I'm a model in some way, that might be an appropriate place
625520	632320	for for prescriptivist notions. But if it's a teenager or somebody talking on the street or
632320	636720	my friend or my neighbor, then if they start using that kind of language, I actually think they're
636720	643600	an asshole. So it doesn't really serve. Yeah, if you're lecturing someone in person,
643680	647120	you're lecturing someone in person on the proper use of the semicolon and they're like,
647120	651360	dude, I was just fucking talking to you. Like I don't, I wasn't using semicolons. Like, well,
651360	655760	you actually raised a really good point that I didn't even think of because I often think of
655760	660640	prescriptivism as being simply wrong, that, you know, people claim that there's a right way to use
660640	665440	language and a wrong way to use language. And I think that's incorrect. I think that languages,
665440	670240	as you say, it's socially determined. And when someone says there's a right and way wrong way,
670240	676320	they're really making a statement about the about society, about, you know, people about the
676320	680480	I'm the right kind of person, and you are the wrong kind of person, and you should be more
680480	686880	like me, I'm standard, I'm normative, I'm dominant, I'm the I'm the rule, and you're the exception.
687760	694880	However, you do make a point that writing is very different from speech, that there are rules that
694880	700960	I do sort of believe are rules in, in writing about, I don't know, I think you need to close
700960	706080	the parentheses, you know, very basic stuff, punctuation marks and things like that. And,
706080	710880	and that made me just you saying that made me realize, oh, wow, yeah, writing just English
710880	717840	writing for someone else to read is far more rule bound than speeches and is actually a completely
717840	721760	different way of using language. They don't, they barely, if you were to write down what I'm
721760	727360	saying to you right now, it would be incoherent because I'm interrupting myself, I'm like inserting
727360	731440	clauses in the middle of sentences and then trailing off, they're completely different ways of using
731440	737040	language. And yet I understand every word that you said because in real speak context where we're
737040	743120	face to face or, you know, television screen to television screen, we, we have context and we
743120	748800	have background knowledge, we also can read other signs from our bodies, eye gaze, various things
748800	752960	like that that allow us to fill in those holes, but in writing, you're absolutely right, we don't
752960	759360	have that contextual information, and it wouldn't make sense. So we need more conventions in writing
759360	764480	than we need in speech. But I want to clarify that speech has a lot of rules. So I think a lot of
764480	769440	times people misconstrued what I'm saying to mean, okay, we don't have to have rules when we talk,
769440	774160	it's not important, because I absolutely agree with you that when we are judging someone on their
774160	779040	speech, because it's different from a prescriptive norm, we're just being prescriptive as assholes
779040	784720	who think we're right and they're not. And that's not an appropriate way to frame someone else's
784720	790880	speech. You can say, I don't like your speech, it's not my preference. But saying something is
790880	795520	disliked is very different than saying something is bad, which makes a moral judgment. And when
795520	800000	I'm telling you that you're not good enough, because of the way your speech, your speeches,
800000	804560	I'm telling you that I'm morally judging you on the basis of something that's just different than
804560	810640	my own views and beliefs. But that doesn't mean that speech is not governed by rules. If we didn't
810640	815520	have rules governing speech, we wouldn't be able to understand each other. We have lots of rules
815520	820320	that govern speech. They're just not the type that appear in a grammar book or a dictionary.
820320	825440	They're the type that we know in here that we learn as babies, that we understand whenever we
825440	830160	have a conversation, no matter who we are and whether we're literate or not. So for example,
830160	837920	if I tell you, Ted thinks that John knows himself well. Well, who does the himself there refer to?
838560	844560	You know, it has to be John. It can't be Ted. Because of the rules that I understand as a
844560	849360	speaker of human language and a two year old, if you give them like two different puppets to
850080	856480	play with and to pick out, you say, Ted knows that John knows himself, and you name one puppet Ted
856480	861280	and the other puppet John, they will always pick the right puppet to refer to himself, because
861280	865920	that's an underlying rule of language that allows them to find the right antecedent. But these are
865920	870400	unspoken rules that we don't need someone to put in a dictionary. And if we did, we'd have to wait
870400	875280	till a kid could read, which would be way too late for language. So language is fundamentally a
875280	878880	different skill than writing, and we shouldn't expect the same rules to apply.
878880	884880	Wow, that is so cool. And my mind is blown whenever I encounter a rule like that one that I learned
884880	889280	a couple of years ago, and you'll tell me the proper version of it. This will be my dumb dumb
889280	894640	recitation of it. But it's that there's a particular order of modifiers or adjectives in
894640	903280	English that if I were to say, you know, the big red scaly British dragon, right, those words all
903280	908960	come in a particular order. If I were to say the scaly red British big dragon, that immediately
908960	914400	sounds wrong to me, and it sounds wrong to you too. And there's like an order of, there's like
914400	920080	quantity, size, where it comes from, what its demeanor is, and those all come in a particular
920080	925440	order that I intuitively know, despite the fact I was never taught this in school. No one ever
925440	929280	sat me down and said, Hey, if you're going to apply eight modifiers in a row to a particular
929280	934320	noun, here's the order they have to come in. And yet I know it. So where do rules like that,
934320	940880	or the himself one that you described, where do they come from? Are they socially determined?
940880	945920	Are they specific to languages or what? Well, you just walked into a big controversy in
945920	951520	logistics. Oh, no. Oh, actually, not, not, oh, no, that's exactly what I love to wander into.
951520	955520	It's an academic controversy. Break it down for us. What is the controversy? Well, if you're a
955520	960800	Chomsky, and meaning someone that follows the syntactic theories of Noam Chomsky, which is,
960800	965600	has been a very influential field of thought in modern American linguistics, you would say,
965600	969600	well, the baby is born with that. It's part of our innate grammar that we're born with. We are
969600	974720	born talking so that we're not not physically talking, but we're born talking in our brain that
974720	979280	we have a specific area of the brain that's devoted to linguistic processing and syntactic
979280	984960	structures. And all it needs is sort of activation or triggering by input from the environment. And
984960	990240	once it hits those triggers, certain, you know, little boxes are checked and it develops language,
990240	996480	this it being the baby. Others are functionalists. And this has become a little more prevalent in
996480	1002720	American thinking, I think, in modern eras versus maybe 20 years ago when Chomsky and philosophy
1002720	1007280	was really the, the only way you would think. And this says that, okay, we are, you know,
1007280	1012320	born with some capacity for language, there do seem to be some fundamental structures that help
1012320	1017680	guide the way that baby's brains process for language. But it's not language exclusive,
1017680	1023920	it's learning exclusive that brains are made to learn in certain ways. And those ways that it
1023920	1030880	learns interacting with the way the world is certain facts about the world, create a knowledge
1030880	1038160	form that that is universal. And so I think a good example of this would be when we,
1038240	1046240	when we have case in the language. So for example, I in English is object K is sorry, subject case,
1046240	1052640	and him is an object case pronoun, right? So you see that there's changes in the same or I and me
1052640	1059280	or he and him. What we find is in languages that are subject verb object, like English,
1059280	1063920	where the subject goes first, and then you have a verb, and then you have an object like I saw him.
1063920	1071520	Yeah, those languages often don't have case or can lose case without too much difficulty because
1071520	1076480	the subject and the object are widely separated. And there's a marker in the middle saying, okay,
1076480	1082160	I'm the verb that acts back on the subject and forward on the the object. So it has a clear
1082160	1087200	separation between that subject and the object. So it's easy for your brain to process who did
1087200	1091680	what to whom without case marking, right? That's just a functional fact of the way that that
1091680	1095680	sentence is structured. But what we find in languages that have the subject and the object
1095680	1100800	close together like a subject object verb language, I think Japanese is a good example of this.
1100800	1108000	German is like this, I learned it in college. German is like, you're like, I, him, blah, blah,
1108000	1112320	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, on Tuesday met. And then you have to wait all the
1112320	1115520	way into the end of the sentence a lot of the time to find out what the verb is. And to see who
1115520	1120320	is doing what to whom. Right, exactly. So exactly like German, what you find is if you have the two
1120320	1126160	subjects and the objects right beside each other, it would be very hard if you didn't mark with case
1126160	1130400	to understand which was the subject and which was the object because they both precede the verb.
1130400	1135040	And so we just find as a natural functional tendency languages that have that kind of structure
1135600	1141760	have case languages that don't have that kind of structure don't have to have case. So these are
1141760	1148960	functional developments that arise for our brain's ability to process information. So again,
1149040	1152800	there are two very different arguments about how language occurs in the brain and how we learn
1152800	1158160	these rules. But fundamentally, it's from the way the brain is structured and how we're
1158160	1164000	structured as humans to process the world. That's really fascinating because whether you're a
1164000	1169520	Chomskyite or a functionalist about it, and we could, I don't think we need to dive deeper into
1169520	1175600	the difference, regardless of which one you are, this is part of the structure of how humans work
1175600	1181840	rather than something you need to learn in a style manual or that you need to be taught in school.
1182960	1188400	It's actually absent from the rules that you would learn in a setting like that because it's
1188400	1194880	sort of built into us, which is really, it's really fascinating that the language pedants
1194880	1199520	don't even bother to tell you about it. But there's all these other rules that they feel that they
1199520	1203280	often need to enforce. Never split an infinitive, you know, that kind of thing
1204480	1211840	is very fascinating to me that we end up, that some folks feel a need to have that kind of rule.
1212640	1216880	Let's move on from the talk about prescriptivism though. One thing I'd love to ask you about,
1216880	1224240	I know you write about, you write about interject, I literally put it into that sentence,
1224560	1230080	interjections like uh or you know, and I would love to talk to you about this because as someone
1230080	1236480	who talks for a living, I actually happen to use a lot of them because I think a little bit faster
1236480	1242880	than I talk sometimes. I have a lot of ideas. I tend to use those words. There have been times
1242880	1246720	that people in the industry have told me, you should really watch yourself for that and make
1246720	1251040	sure you don't use those that often because they make you sound stupid or whatever. And then I go
1251040	1256160	through a little period where I try to stop myself from saying you know so much. But it's so much a
1256160	1261200	feature of my speech that I don't know, I don't know if I'll ever be able to completely eradicate
1261200	1265200	it. So what is your view as a linguist of where those interjections come from and what purpose
1265200	1269600	they have? Well, first I want to apologize because after we talk about them, you're going to hear
1269600	1274560	them every time you say them for the rest of our conversation. So we should have saved this for the
1274560	1279440	end because people are going to hear me do it for the entire rest of the podcast and it's going to
1279520	1286400	drive them fucking insane. Exactly, once you hear it once and people talk about it. So I apologize
1286400	1291200	in advance to everybody listening. But the nice thing is we shouldn't be so upset about it because
1291200	1295760	those things are doing great work for us. And as you said, you talk for a living. It's different
1295760	1301280	than writing. If I stuck a lot of you know, and all those things in my writing, then it might be
1301280	1307040	distracting and it might detract from the purpose. But when we're in conversation, our job is not
1307040	1313680	only the strict literal semantic information that I'm trying to transmit. It's also the relationship
1313680	1319200	we have, the ideas we have about it, and also my personal beliefs about what I'm saying,
1319840	1324720	how I came to that knowledge, whether I'm sure about that knowledge or less sure than that
1324720	1329600	knowledge, something called epistemics in linguistics. So all these different things are
1329600	1337760	competing for our ability to phrase them somehow. And so things like, you know, actually well. So
1337760	1343440	all of those help direct the listener to have certain expectations about what the speaker's
1343440	1349120	intending. And this is actually very helpful as a listener to have someone point out to you how
1349120	1354320	you're supposed to take something because we all have been in those situations where we say something
1354320	1361360	and it's not quite taken like we intended it. A lot of times if you don't sign post or provide these
1361360	1368400	conversational cohesion markers, then you increase the tendency of other people to misunderstand
1368400	1373680	where you're headed, your own relationship to what you're saying, or how certain you were about
1373680	1378960	what you're saying. So when I say something such as like, when I use like as a discourse marker,
1378960	1385040	what like communicates in many cases is a subjective sensibility. This idea that what I'm
1385040	1391040	telling you is not precise, but it's sort of the sense that I want you to get from what I'm saying,
1391040	1396400	or I want to use it for emphasis. So for example, if I said I was waiting like 20 hours for you,
1396400	1402400	dude, what I probably wasn't doing is waiting 20 hours and I don't intend for you to take it that
1402400	1407600	way. What I'm emphasizing by putting that like in there is that, hey, asshole, you made me wait
1407600	1412640	for a really long time and I pissed off about it. So it's communicating that versus saying,
1412640	1417840	I was waiting for 20 hours, which certainly doesn't complicate the same force, the same
1417840	1423440	emphatic force. So all of those little markers are extremely meaningful in our everyday speech.
1423440	1427760	And in fact, if we look at studies that remove those, those discourse markers like you know,
1427760	1433920	and like, and well, and so from the speech of subjects, and we have other listeners listen
1433920	1439120	to them and rate them on how sociable they were, how well likable, how likable they were,
1439120	1443360	those kinds of things, we find that when we remove those discourse markers, people hear
1443360	1449520	that speech as less friendly and more robotic. So we want them in there. So you're just friendlier
1449520	1457040	and not a robot. So isn't that good? That is good, except that I often find that other people in
1457040	1462400	my position, broadcasters, if you watch someone on CNN, you watch a CNN guest, they've likely
1463040	1469600	trained themselves to remove all the us from their speech. And it's sort of seen as a mark of
1469600	1475600	professionalism. And but do you think that that maybe that's counterproductive because it's making
1475600	1480880	those folks less friendly, it makes them seem stiffer or more broadcasty? Or I suppose it depends
1480880	1484960	on the on the medium, but well, that's actually a really good question, because I think what you're
1484960	1489040	drawing attention to is two different things than what we were talking about previously. So I was
1489120	1494320	mentioning discourse markers, like like, you know, some and well, but what you're talking about is
1494320	1500720	I'm and which are actually filled pauses. So those are fundamentally and functionally different than
1501440	1506480	filler words, which is what you were talking about previously. And they do very different work. So
1506480	1511840	we're things like, you know, well, so they, they actually are for conversational cohesion, and they
1511840	1518560	signpost and provide some epistemic value often. So how someone is to take something. I'm and are
1518640	1524400	actually markers of speech planning. And they don't don't themselves have any kind of literal
1524400	1529760	meaning that they contribute to what I'm saying, whereas so does and well does they actually
1529760	1537040	contribute some sort of meaning. I'm and I in fact, are usually more likely to occur when someone
1537040	1541040	has not rehearsed what they're going to say when we're in spontaneous discourse, when we're saying
1541040	1547760	them something that's more abstract, more difficult, less familiar, those kinds of situations will
1547760	1553760	increase the numbers of us and arms that we use. So when we're in a context like a CNN expert,
1553760	1558640	and we expect someone to know what they're talking about, I'm and I would signal to us that they
1558640	1563440	are not practiced, and they are not familiar with what they're saying, and therefore would be taken
1563440	1570240	as a disfavorable sign of their ability to communicate. In conversation, though, I want to
1570240	1574720	know people are working hard to come up with interesting things to say. So if we're in a
1574720	1580560	regular back and forth conversation at a party or at a bar, and you say a couple times what that
1580560	1585280	tells me is that you're actually spending some cognitive effort on coming up with what to say.
1585280	1589440	So in those cases, I don't think there's anything wrong with using them. In a case where I'm giving
1589440	1596000	a public talk, for example, or I'm on television as a host, I would expect it to be more practice,
1596000	1599920	and therefore it would probably be less valuable to use those in those contexts.
1599920	1605920	Oh my god, this is that's such an incredible breakdown of when it's useful and when it's not
1605920	1609600	and when we actually might want to remove those words and when we might not want to.
1610800	1615120	And I think a lot of my conversation here, part of what I'm doing in conversations like
1615120	1618880	this with you, I am thinking on my feet because I'm sort of the I'm the interlock you to hear,
1618880	1622880	I'm not the expert, I'm asking you questions, I'm trying to be surprised by what you're saying,
1622880	1628080	you know, and so it makes sense for me to be puzzling through my thoughts as I'm talking to
1628080	1631360	you because that's the sort of conversation I'm trying to have. So in this context, this is a
1631360	1638480	good context for me to go, oh, that's really interesting, Valerie. But if I'm in the opposite
1638480	1643920	context, maybe I'm being interviewed about something I know a lot about, then perhaps it
1643920	1647920	might be better for me to be a little bit more locked and loaded if I'm trying to communicate
1647920	1653760	more expertise. Also, when you're talking about conversational markers like like,
1653760	1659200	one that I've heard come up more recently is putting right at the end of a sentence. I find
1659200	1663840	myself doing that in interviews. Actually, sometimes when I am the expert in a context right
1663840	1669760	now, I'm being interviewed a lot about union matters because I'm in the leadership of my union
1669760	1673440	and we're in the news a lot lately because we're on strike. And so something I'll do a lot is I'll
1673440	1680800	explain, right? And I'll just sort of toss that little right at the end. And it feels like a
1680800	1687040	similar sort of social lubrication where I'm trying to draw the audience along and
1687040	1692240	communicate that I'm making an argument that I hope is going down easily. It seems like a cousin
1692240	1697440	to like rather than a cousin to perhaps. You know, it's funny because I actually have an
1697440	1701920	anecdote in the book where I was talking to a podcaster and they were so relieved to hear me
1701920	1706080	talk about all these different features of having a purpose and being useful because they said that
1706080	1711200	they're often called out for their over frequent use of right in just the same context you talk
1711200	1717440	about it. So it must be a podcaster right. Another person who is regularly taken to task for their
1717440	1723120	use of right in that same way is actually Mark Zuckerberg. He uses right a lot in that context.
1723120	1728640	So see, you're in very good company. That right is. Well, I don't want to be in company with Mark
1728640	1733360	Zuckerberg personally. That's what we can get. That's a different episode, but you know, I have
1733360	1737920	my beefs with Mark, but okay, I understand that we might be using it in the same way. Please go on.
1737920	1742480	Well, so what you're doing there is actually inviting the audience to make inferences. So
1742480	1746960	when you use right in that context, you're pausing to let them catch up and say, okay,
1746960	1751120	I'm checking that you're making the right inference and you're keeping up with me. So it's a
1751120	1757840	licensure device where you're using it to help give them a moment to get up to speed and then
1758400	1764000	making sure that they're getting the inference you're intending. So a lot of times people have
1764000	1768960	dislike that because it causes work on the side of the listener. If you're inviting someone to
1768960	1774400	make inferences, you're asking them to do work and some listeners may feel like that's asking a lot
1774400	1779680	of them to do actual work. So, you know, I think it's funny that that bothers us, but I've heard
1779680	1784720	that one in particular, that inferring right to be something that people remark on quite often as
1784800	1789360	they've noticed more and more in people's speech. But I think what it really is is just the sign
1789360	1794880	that we're in conversation and we recognize we have a listener in conversation. It's not just us
1794880	1800000	talking, right? You're actually, and I just used it, we're actually making sure that someone is there
1800000	1805360	with us and moving along with us. Now, I think where people sometimes get upset is when they're
1805360	1811520	listening to people on the radio or on a podcast and they're using that right. And maybe the people
1811520	1816080	are not agreeing or not making that same inference. And that's where they're getting a little tweaked
1816080	1820560	about it. Yeah, they're like, Oh, no, not right. I disagree with you. Like, I think taxes should be
1820560	1826480	higher or whatever it is. Yeah, exactly. But no, you're completely correct that I do it because
1827600	1833200	I am trying to lay out an argument for the person listening and I want them to come along. I was
1833200	1837440	like, Hey, are you still on the, are you still on the wagon? Like, are we still traveling together
1837440	1844720	here? We're in this together. I'm not just like blah, blah, blah. I'm trying to lay out a trail
1844720	1848560	of breadcrumbs for you and hope that you follow it and we're in it together. And I'm trying to
1848560	1853440	remind them of that. At least that's what I think I'm doing. It is wonderful to talk to you. You are
1853440	1859840	like a therapist for podcasters. And I honestly think this is a fee that you should offer where
1859840	1864400	you just talk to people about the linguistic ticks that everyone in the YouTube comments is getting
1864400	1869920	on their ass about. Cause it does, it is something that happens to us as public speakers is that as
1869920	1874480	soon as someone comments on something like, Oh, do I need to, do I need to change it? And oh,
1874480	1881200	God, everything I'm doing is wrong. You know, it's, it's very, uh, you can really get in your own
1881200	1889520	head. And I guess I wonder what is the value of trying to restrict your own speech in that way,
1889520	1895440	trying to control your own speech and be rigid with it versus doing what comes naturally. Like a
1895440	1899680	lot of times on a podcast, I just want to be my natural self a little bit more up and talkative
1899680	1905040	than my natural self, but I'm not trying to, I worry that if I were to police myself for the
1905040	1909680	rights and the ums and the us too much that I would become stiff and it wouldn't be as good of a
1909680	1914160	conversation. What do you think? Well, I think then you'd get angry emails saying that you were too
1914160	1918480	stiff and, and you know, sounded like a uptight stick in the mud. So you're never going to make
1918800	1923200	people happy. It doesn't matter what it is. There's always going to be something in your speech
1923200	1929520	that people will respond to and dislike. And the more that you are not white and male, the more
1929520	1936240	often that will happen. So women in particular in broadcast settings get a ton of voice hate mail,
1936240	1941760	much more than men in similar positions and African Americans likewise. So it really,
1941760	1946000	which really interesting is we have this set belief about here's how someone should talk,
1946080	1951200	but that belief is actually fairly fluid in the sense that even if someone talked the way we think
1951200	1956000	we want them to talk, then something else in their speech is going to irritate us. So, you know,
1956000	1962320	for every like that annoys somebody and someone's speech, then they'll say, I hate how you use like
1962320	1967600	while they use so a lot, right? And then for every so at the beginning of a sentence that they use
1967600	1974640	that someone else hates, that person uses well too much or uses okay all the time or uses right
1974640	1978800	in the middle of their sentences. So there's always going to be something that someone doesn't
1978800	1983120	like. And if we try to spend most of our time worrying about what people like and dislike in
1983120	1987840	our speech, then we're not going to be authentic and real and have connections. And that's the
1987840	1993280	point of speech in the end. And if we can move away from the idea that there is a right way to
1993280	1998400	talk and a good way to talk, and then there's a bad way to talk, instead, we look at it as
1998400	2005920	there are ways that we have in common that help bond us as speakers and other ways that help
2005920	2011120	point to the fact that we are not the same person and that's okay. Then I think we can be a more
2011760	2017600	connecting empathetic audience and speaker at the same time. It's just getting our head wrapped
2017600	2022560	around that I can dislike the way that someone talks, but that doesn't mean that the way they
2022560	2027280	talk is bad. And that's a crucial distinction. That is a wonderful message to take us to break with.
2027280	2031920	But when we get back, I want to talk to you about teenagers and slang and all these crazy
2031920	2035200	words that kids are always coming up with. But we have to take a really quick break. We'll be
2035200	2040080	right back with more Valerie Friedland. Hey, everybody. Just a reminder, if you want to support

2068400	2073600	and I'm going to St. Louis, Missouri had Adam Conover.net slash tour dates to get tickets.
2073600	2077760	See you there. And now back to the interview. Okay, we're back with Valerie Friedland before
2077760	2084080	the break. We were just talking about how women are often criticized excessively for the way that
2084080	2089280	they speak their use of language when they're speaking publicly. That's certainly true. I want
2089280	2092640	to talk about another group of people who are often criticized for their language, which is young
2092640	2098880	people, teenagers or even kids are constantly being told that they're speaking wrong. In my intro,
2098880	2104400	I talked about this case where a UK school is trying to ban ban the use of slang entirely,
2105360	2112960	which obviously seems completely excessive. Why is slang such a sore spot for adults?
2112960	2117760	And what purpose does it serve for young people? Well, first of all, anybody trying to ban slang,
2117760	2123920	good luck with that one. There's just no way. You know, young people are the innovators in language.
2123920	2129440	And pretty much we have them to thank for all the features of language we use today without
2129440	2135040	young people. We would have no linguistic revelations, we would have no innovations,
2135040	2139920	we would have no new words to describe the experiences that we have in our world. So
2139920	2145520	it's funny that we want to eradicate what they add to our language instead of embrace it. But
2145520	2150800	I think a lot of it is because what we notice that young people do is invent novel slang that's
2150800	2158080	maybe a little counterculture or rebellious or even taboo in some ways. And a lot of what they say
2158160	2163920	is never going to hit mainstream and become the language of our future. But the more underlying
2164480	2170320	things that they introduce, the new ways of using language innovatively like saying,
2170320	2177520	adulting sucks from adult, they follow the pattern that many of us have trod before. So for example,
2177520	2185040	parent was a noun long before it was a verb. So if I say parenting sucks, nobody blinks an eye and
2185040	2190320	most of us that are parents would approve of that message. But when I say adulting sucks,
2190320	2195120	I roll my eyes because teenagers are using language in a bad way. But we didn't really see
2195120	2200880	the word parenting come into widespread use until the 20th century. It was always a noun before that.
2201600	2207600	Shakespeare was renowned for using nouns as verbs and verbs as noun. So this is just part of the
2207600	2212480	natural evolution of language. But it's all in the mouths of the young, the young who are more
2212480	2217520	creative and innovative and more free to do creative things with language that these types
2217520	2223360	of forms come forth. And because they're different than what we say, and because we think we say
2223360	2228080	everything correctly, we judge young people for doing it a lot of times because they are doing
2228080	2232240	it a little bit to piss us off. I mean, admit it when you were a teenager, you wanted to you
2232240	2235760	wanted to piss your parents off. And the first thing you want to do is speak differently than
2235760	2240240	your parents. And that drives a lot of this creativity and innovation. But the thing we
2240240	2246400	forget is that young people also have more neural plasticity than us old folks, which is really
2246400	2251440	unfortunate for us. But they can make much quicker neurofiber connections, they have more
2251440	2258720	more neural connectivity. And they also are able to analyze really underlying distributions,
2258720	2264400	really subtle variations in things better than adults can. So that primes them for linguistic
2264400	2269040	innovation, because they notice these low lying tendencies at a rate much higher than old people
2269040	2275200	do. So then the problem is they start to use it. And it's different than what we say. And then we
2275200	2281760	hate it. So that's really the cycle of language change. This is just there. They have a special
2281760	2286000	ability as young people that we have lost and we're angry about it. It's like when you see,
2287120	2294080	you know, when you're, look, I cannot ski, I'm so bad at it. And now I'm, I also would never do it
2294080	2298560	because I am too worried about my joints at this point in my life. I'm not going to take that risk
2298560	2304320	with my body. And when I see a five year old on skis or a four year old on skis and you see them
2304320	2308400	and you're like, man, when they fall down, they don't even feel it. They bounce, you know,
2308400	2314480	and I resent them for that because they have this ability of youth that I have lost. Maybe that is
2314480	2318000	why we get mad at them. We're like, you're coming up with new words. I can't do that anymore.
2318000	2322080	Exactly. Well, also remember that when you're five, you're only two feet from the ground.
2322640	2327440	That helps when you fall. But yes, it's, it's partially that. It's partially that we are a
2327440	2333120	little resentful of their creativity. But I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we see
2333120	2339280	young people as not quite fully formed. And a lot of times they use language in ways that are
2339280	2344880	slightly rebellious. I mean, the attraction to new forms of young people is usually because
2344880	2349920	it's different than what parents do. And it's a little bit rebellious and nonconformist. And
2349920	2355440	then as adults, we are constantly telling our kids to slow down when they're screaming down the
2355440	2359760	mountain, right? And we're doing the same thing with language. So even though we might teach them
2359760	2365040	to ski, we don't teach them to go 100 miles per hour skiing. Same thing with language. We, we give
2365040	2369200	them the fundamental structure of language. That's our role as parents. And when they're born
2369200	2373040	and we're, we're giving them input, they're getting our system as the fundamental system.
2373040	2378400	But then they go to school and they do something called vernacular reorganization, which is just
2378400	2382640	the fancy linguistic term for they look at their peer group and go, wow, there's so much cooler
2382640	2388400	than mom. I'm going to be like that. And then they adopt that because that's really who they want
2388400	2394880	to model themselves after. But I think parents can rest assured that all of that finds its place.
2394880	2399920	And we, we go through these periods in adolescence where we're really attracted to these rebellious,
2399920	2407440	nonconformist, maybe even nonstandard, maybe even offensive things at times. But what we find is
2407440	2412320	something called age grading. As kids get into the professional work world, as they become adults
2412320	2418080	and become parents, they naturally start to adjust their speech towards those old boring
2418080	2423840	traditional norms that older speakers adopt. So whatever was coming up as a new feature in their
2423840	2430400	speech that's not stigmatized will become the new norm. But stigma stigmatized or rebellious
2430400	2435120	features tend to get dampened in their rate and they don't get used as much. So like use is a
2435120	2439680	good example. A lot of people hate like they think their kids use it too much. They want to kill,
2439680	2445680	you know, kill it in their kids speech. But as kids move from being a 17 year old, you know,
2445680	2452080	like user in every Senate to a 25 year old professional, they will naturally start to use
2452080	2456000	like less often, even though they want to eradicate it completely from their speech,
2456000	2461200	but they'll use it at a level that's not highly stigmatized anymore. It's just a natural transition
2461280	2466560	that happens. That's so cool. Well, one of the things I think is coolest about the way
2466560	2472720	teenagers or young people use languages, there's like a natural creativity that is so exuberant
2472720	2477200	that like every school in America has its own slang that no one else has ever heard.
2477200	2483520	I had a friend who was teaching school at a, you know, at a high school in Brooklyn for just a
2483520	2487120	couple of years. He's a substitute teacher and he was telling me the kids slang, this is about 10
2487120	2492560	years ago. He said that kids were using the phrase, it's quiet for that now to mean that
2492560	2498080	something is boring or that it's like old hat, you know, it's, it's, it's passe or that you
2498080	2502560	shouldn't do something cause it's the wrong time, you know, like you shouldn't, you know, if you're,
2502560	2506000	if you're like singing a song during study hall or it's quiet for that now, we're not doing that
2506000	2510400	right now, you know, and I love that phrase. I just love saying it. I still say it to my
2510400	2514080	girlfriend around the house as quiet for that now. You know, she's like, you want to watch that
2514080	2518320	show and ask quiet for that now. I don't like it anymore, you know, but it's like this particular
2518320	2522480	piece of slang. I mean, maybe people, maybe other people in the comments have heard it. Maybe it was
2522480	2530800	all over New York city in 2012 or whatever. But, but I never heard it except from my friend
2530800	2535840	who reported it hearing it, you know, in the wild. And I'm sure that kids in that school are no
2535840	2539920	longer saying that they're, that they're onto something else new. And that is, I think the
2540000	2545360	coolest thing. It's, I mean, that's the true folk process. That's people coming up with their own
2545360	2550080	exuberant uses of language that means something to them. And then it sort of dissipates over time.
2550080	2554880	I think that's an amazing thing about language. It is. It's remarkable when you watch young people
2554880	2559680	in language and how they engage with it, create it, innovate it, and then leave it behind or
2559680	2565520	embrace it for the future. So a lot of the things you're talking about are slang terms or words
2565520	2570480	themselves. So my daughter's always using the ones like, they're such a pick me. And I'm like,
2570480	2575360	what a pick me? What do you mean a pick me? But what she meant was they're a remember in school
2575360	2580000	when you would be the one wanting to be on the volleyball team, he'd like, pick me, pick me.
2580000	2584000	Well, now they use that word to mean there's, they're always trying to get out in front and
2584000	2587680	be the person chosen. So they're always somebody who needs to kind of attention to my daughter's
2587680	2592560	like, Oh my God, what a pick me. So they've used this creative knowledge of, you know,
2592560	2598080	this idea of what you do for sports or in gym class to become a descriptor of a person's specific
2598080	2603360	style of interacting or engaging. Or she'll say, Yeah, I'm so aggressed, which is, you know, I'm
2603360	2607840	angry. It's just they're really creative and wonderful with language. But those are vocabulary
2607840	2611920	words, which are actually pretty ephemeral in language, so they can pick them up and use them.
2611920	2615920	And then when they're not cool anymore, or too many people do it, or especially if adults start to
2615920	2620800	pick it up, then it's bye bye, right? I'm not interested. But what we don't understand is that
2620800	2627040	young people are actually the heart of language evolution more generally, so that what they're
2627040	2631680	doing with language at a much more subtle structural level, the changes that they're making
2631680	2637440	in very small tweaks and refinements are actually going to be the future of our language in bigger
2637440	2643200	ways. So let me give you an example that maybe you hadn't noticed. When you're using words like
2643280	2651200	everybody, somebody, nobody, do you even say buddy anymore? Or do you say everyone, someone, no one?
2651760	2657360	Everyone. I actually couldn't tell you. I would think I would think I use, let's say everyone was
2657360	2662560	there, everybody was there. I'm not sure which I'd use more often. To be honest, I'm sorry to not
2662560	2666000	have a good answer. Well, you probably know it's actually not surprising because people are not
2666000	2670240	very reflective on that, right? You don't think about everybody or no one. And that's how language
2670240	2676000	change happens, where one form starts to be used more often by people that are somehow cooler or
2676000	2682160	hipper or better than you in some way socially, often in adolescence. And what seems to be happening
2682160	2687440	is buddy is being replaced by one, especially among younger speakers. You see very few younger
2687440	2693920	speakers say everybody, somebody, nobody. In fact, almost all of them say everyone, someone, no one.
2693920	2698160	Now that's a much more, that's a much more underlying structural change. It's not a slang
2698160	2703040	word. It's not a vocabulary word. But when we look now at older speakers, we find that starting
2703040	2707520	to creep into older speakers speech. So when we do a study and we look at different age groups,
2707520	2713520	what we find is that everybody, the buddy in those words is losing ground to one,
2713520	2719680	which will be in 10 years, 15 years, probably the only form that we use anymore and everybody
2719680	2725760	and nobody will seem very archaic and old. So these are actually the more substantive types
2725760	2730400	of change that young people bring into our language. Another good example is using weight
2730400	2735120	as a discourse marker. So I might, if you're, you know, somewhere and I need to go get something,
2735120	2742560	I might say, could you wait five minutes, meaning physically stand for some time to wait for me.
2742560	2747120	But what we find now is people are saying, wait, I don't think so, where they're actually using
2747120	2753200	weight as a discourse marker, which doesn't really mean weight any particular amount of time. When I
2753200	2757360	say weight, I don't think so. I'm not telling you to physically stop and wait for me. What I'm
2757360	2763680	saying is a metaphorical pausing. I'm taking a metaphorical pause here. What we find is that's
2763680	2769520	also a new change coming in young people say, wait a lot more than older speakers who don't
2769520	2775840	say, wait, they say, wait a minute. And so it went from no discourse marker where weight was only
2775840	2782000	used as a main verb that actually meant pausing to wait a minute used by older speakers to mean
2782000	2788800	metaphorical pausing to now younger speakers that only say, wait, not wait a minute. And what we
2788800	2792640	find is when we look 50 years ago, when we start to study that change, not only was it young
2792640	2798640	speakers, it was lower class young speakers and lower class and young are the magic sauce to
2798640	2804240	language change. And that seems to then suggest that that will be what we say going forward that
2804240	2808640	wait a minute is gone the way of the dodo and weight will be the new discourse marker. So
2808640	2812640	these are really cool things that we don't even realize we're doing. And then they work their
2812640	2817600	way into our language because young people started them. Yeah, that is so fascinating. Now I was
2817600	2822320	about to ask you about race and language because that's, you know, there's a lot of interactions
2822320	2827120	there in American life. You just brought up class though, class and race often intersect in American
2827120	2834960	life. So how do those elements come into it? I mean, obviously there's a history of race in
2834960	2839840	America is very fraught. A lot of our, I think, greatest language innovations come from marginalized
2839840	2844880	groups throughout American history. How do those things work together? Well, absolutely. Just like
2844880	2851280	lower class speech features being something that is often a triggering impetus for change.
2851280	2858320	So is ethnicity. And not only that, but it could also be things like not necessarily ethnicity,
2858320	2862640	but other subcultures that are marginalized like drag culture. Drag culture is actually
2862640	2867920	brought a lot of words into our language. So for example, vogue is a word that came from drag
2867920	2873280	culture. And I think the word of the year this year was a suffix called ussy, which was the
2873280	2879200	ossification. Who's word of the year? Was that Mariam Webster? That was the American Dialect
2879200	2884000	Society's word of the year because that was also from drag culture where it was the ossification
2884000	2892560	of all things could be ossified. The American Dialect Society is cool, man. You're with
2892640	2900720	it. I assume you're a member. I am a voting member. Yes, I am. You voted for ussy. I did not actually,
2900720	2905440	there was another word I really wanted. I have to say ussy was a runner up, but I can't remember
2905440	2909440	what my, see it's gone. I don't even remember it anymore because it didn't win. Oh, wow, because
2909440	2913440	it's not the word of the year. Well, no, ussy is like, look, all you got to do is look at the
2913440	2917600	TikTok comments and you'll see that ussy is indeed the word or the suffix of the year.
2918560	2921840	So yeah, I mean, tell me more about that phenomenon.
2921840	2927920	Well, you know, what happens is things happen in adolescents that are cool and interesting that
2927920	2932400	have nothing to do with the types of things that we value as adults, especially standard speaking
2932400	2938240	adults who disdain anything associated with marginalized groups or groups that we disfavor in
2938240	2942320	society. But when you're a young person and you're in school or you're in a community,
2942880	2948480	what you really want to do is stand out in some way. We also want to sort of project these
2948480	2953040	different kinds of identities. And a lot of times that's tied into these groups that are
2953040	2959600	marginalized in society, such as African-American culture or drag culture or whatever culture
2959600	2965200	that you're identifying with, but particularly in inner city schools, if you want to, you know,
2965200	2969120	not get beaten up for your lunch money every day, one of the ways to do that is project
2969120	2976400	speech features that signal toughness, nonconformity, physical strength. And one way that particularly
2976400	2983600	young white men do this is to be adopting the features from groups in school that they identify
2983600	2990320	as physically tough, as rebellious, as nonconformist, as dangerous in some way. And even though these
2990320	2995600	are stereotypes about those cultures that are not true to the cultures themselves, they have much
2995600	3000320	more depth than that. The features that those groups use, so African-American features in
3000320	3007120	particular, are often then appropriated by these young men to personify those identities, like
3007120	3013280	being tough, being cool and being macho, to help them fit in in the world. And then these features
3013280	3018560	then grow up with them. So they become part of the language of the larger mainstream culture,
3018560	3023840	which is how we get a lot of features, like even the word jazz, which was actually an African-American
3023840	3029200	word, get into mainstream culture. And I think one way we see it now is woke. The word woke was
3029200	3033760	actually an African-American English word that now has made it into mainstream culture for better
3033760	3038800	or worse, depending on how you look at it. Well, then depending on how it's used, I mean, the problem
3038800	3045920	is that even though these are the folks who are being incredibly innovative with language, right?
3045920	3051120	As you say, the intersection of youth and class and marginalization that sort of caused the
3051120	3056960	innovation and also caused it to be adopted by the more, you know, by the dominant, you know,
3056960	3063040	normative folks, it's the marginalized groups who get criticized for their use of language or
3063040	3068000	attacked for the use of language. I mean, just, you know, having gone through, you know, in the
3068000	3073600	90s, growing up in, you know, the war over ebonics as a phrase where that became a punchline, right?
3073600	3082000	As, you know, a pretty well-meaning linguistic project was turned into a joke that was, you
3082000	3086960	know, on the everybody in white culture made fun of for a couple of years at the same time
3086960	3091680	that they were then appropriating those same words and those same speech patterns is like a
3091680	3097040	really pernicious cycle, is it not? Absolutely. I mean, the funny thing is that we really hate
3097040	3103040	language change. We think it's somehow bad that it points to some sort of decay in society, but
3103040	3109360	it's really because language change typically begins in the groups that we have stereotypes
3109360	3115920	or prejudice against. And because of that association, we dislike it and we try to push it
3115920	3122960	away. But it is, it's very much the fact that we don't police our language when we are members of
3122960	3128240	marginalized communities, according to the norms of the dominant society, that we allow in-group
3128240	3132640	markers to develop, that we allow different linguistic tendencies that are underlying all
3132640	3138320	language to just affect change in our varieties, that those things come out of those groups rather
3138320	3143920	than the groups that maintain these standards and forcibly don't let their language adapt.
3143920	3149360	And then it becomes staid and boring and it doesn't have much life. I mean, look at Latin,
3149360	3153760	right? We didn't, we don't allow Latin to change and no one's using that to hang out and go to the
3153760	3159200	bars and form solidarity and connection. But when we allow language to emerge and become
3159760	3165840	naturally communicative, naturally connection making, naturally part of our identity process,
3165840	3172880	then it becomes something that other people look at and basically want to take over because
3172880	3178720	we want what that represents. We want the social connectedness that we feel those features
3178720	3186400	amplify. So when I hear someone using really low sort of informal, low class speech, it might
3186400	3191200	seem bad to me as a speaker of standard English, but it also means like they're informal, they're
3191200	3195760	intimate, they're relaxed, they're familiar, they're friendly, right? It has these other
3195760	3201440	associations. And when I'm an adolescent, that's really attractive to me. I want that. I want to
3201440	3205920	have that. And also, even when I'm a standard speaker, when I go home and talk to my kids or
3205920	3210000	I go home and I talk to my spouse, I don't want to come home talking like the office. I want to
3210000	3215280	use the speech that's connection, the speech that's familiarity, the speech that's intimacy.
3215280	3222240	And you can't get that without some emphatic senses, some subjective senses, some natural
3222960	3228880	laid back kinds of features. And those are what we draw from in marginalized group speech,
3228880	3234640	because that is what that has come to represent, the connection, the community, the social identity
3234880	3240720	of friendliness, of companionship, of solidarity. That's something that even the most
3240720	3246240	priggish people who want to criticize marginalized group... And by the way, when you say we don't
3246240	3251360	like that speech, I like to think that I do like it. I'm more broad-minded about it.
3252240	3256480	But even if somebody is that priggish about it and they're like, oh, how dare they talk that way,
3256480	3259840	they're still hearing that language going, oh, I wish I had that level of community.
3259840	3264400	I wish I could partake in that a little bit. And they end up adopting those words because
3264880	3272320	communicates a certain level of informality and ease with other people that we all crave in our
3272320	3278480	lives to have... Oh, you hear another community talking with that kind of ease. I want to use
3278480	3284720	those words too, because they communicate comfort and community in a way that I crave. And that I
3284720	3291600	don't get from my formal, rigid, office, white, affluent talk. And I think there's also, especially
3291600	3296800	with African American speech, there's an edginess and a counterculture-ness that we tend to
3297840	3302080	find associated with those kinds of speech forms. And a lot of that has to do with the very fact
3302080	3308640	that we marginalize those communities. When we push a community to the extremes, to the edges,
3309440	3316720	then we also create a situation where we almost envy their status as outsiders and as rule breakers
3316720	3323600	and as sort of being non-traditionalists. And even though they didn't ask for that role, and often
3323600	3330080	they have traditions of their own, from the perspective of the dominant group, that's the
3330080	3336320	kinds of qualities that get put on their features of speech, put on their styles of dress, put on
3336320	3342160	cultural things that they have associated with them. Music. Right. And so then that becomes enviable
3342160	3348960	because it seems cool and edgy and chill and laid back and whatever qualities, edgy and even
3348960	3353600	gangster, right? I think a lot of young speakers, young male speakers are attracted to that kind
3353600	3358240	of dangerous, rebellious sort of sense that it has. And that's really something we put on it
3358240	3362880	because we pushed it to the outside. But then by doing that, we want to bring it back in and make
3362880	3368240	it part of our speech so that we can get those qualities that now those features have when they're
3368320	3373440	used by members of that community. So it's this really interesting cycle of pushing out, pulling
3373440	3379360	in, pushing out, pulling in. But then, of course, what happens is young speakers adopt it and then
3379360	3386000	older speakers who don't see the value in it, disdain their speech as well, until those become
3386000	3392320	more dominant and are used in wider culture. So when words like jazz or woke start to get picked
3392320	3397520	up and move more mainstream, we almost forget where they came from, which then is a disservice,
3397520	3401040	of course, to the people that started them. So it's a weird vicious cycle.
3401040	3408800	Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're describing really the structure of how racism and marginalization
3408800	3415440	eventually leads to appropriation. And in some cases, theft, in some cases, productive borrowing.
3416560	3425520	But you're just describing the entire problem of American culture and race and it just through
3425520	3431920	linguistics. I mean, and it really goes to prove the point that you learn so much about
3431920	3437440	people and the structure of a society through language, which sort of, it gets to my point
3437440	3445360	that I made in the intro to this episode that we waste so much time criticizing the speech of others,
3445360	3450800	whether that's marginalized groups or each other or ourselves, when we could be learning from
3450800	3456320	that speech. We could be understanding, oh, wait, this says something about the speaker,
3456320	3461600	about the structure of our society that we use language in this way. Does it not?
3461600	3467040	Absolutely. And I think if we think back to the history of English, one great example of us doing
3467040	3472000	this and now it's so assimilated into our language that we don't even remember that we did it, is
3472000	3477520	how many, many of the words that we use in modern English and even our pronouns, for example, come
3477520	3484000	from the Vikings who were definitely not looked upon favorably when they were pillaging in the
3484000	3489440	eighth and ninth centuries. But a lot of the words that we have, so for example, the pronoun they
3489440	3495680	and them, those are Norse, those are Norse words, words like window and sister and skirt,
3495680	3500720	those are Norse words. And the interesting things about the words that we borrowed from Norse,
3500720	3507760	from the Vikings, are their everyday words, the words about life. Because when we interacted
3507760	3512960	with the Vikings, when it wasn't vicious, obviously, when it was, you know, in everyday
3512960	3518400	interactions, it was about the day to day work of life. It was about seeing each other in the farms
3518400	3523040	and learning from each other in those casual interactions. But when we interacted with the
3523040	3528320	French, it was up, right? It was because they were the rulers, it was us as the servants,
3528400	3533280	them as the rulers. So the types of words that we have from French tend to be the highfalutin
3533280	3539200	words, words from medicine, words for law, like the word judge, the word prison, the word government,
3539200	3543520	those are all from French, because that's the kind of interaction we have with them. So when we
3543520	3549200	look at even the types of words that come in from these different subcultures, we learn a lot about
3549200	3554720	our relationship with those speakers. Yeah. And man, it's just, as soon as you start looking for
3554720	3560240	this stuff, you see it everywhere. I mean, even what I do is stand up comedy, right? It has its own
3560240	3564000	language. It has its own way of speaking. One of my favorite things to do is talk to other stand
3564000	3570080	up comics in a green room. And we have our own, it's not quite a dialect or even a, you know,
3570080	3574560	sort of a, you know, Carney language or anything like that. It's just like there's a few,
3574560	3580800	there's a few unusual words. There's a few unusual ways of speaking. There's extreme casualness that
3580800	3587840	like connotes a, you know, that we're participants in a certain, in a certain world. And some of those
3587840	3592800	words, if, but not all have made their way into the, into the broader language. George
3592800	3597440	Carlin famously did a bit about how you kill, you crush, right? If you did well and you die,
3597440	3604160	if you, if you bomb, you bomb, right? There's all these words about violence. But, you know,
3604160	3610400	it's like, this is happening in a million subcultures around the world at every single moment. And
3610400	3615840	it's such a beautiful thing about language. And all we can really do is, is hope to describe it and,
3615840	3620400	and use it to understand each other rather than make rules around it. I think, I don't know.
3620400	3626080	Absolutely. And I think once you start unraveling that thread, it's so cool where it leads because
3626080	3630560	you, you have these ideas about language that are formed from this weird thing you do in school,
3630560	3635040	right? You go to grammar class and that's really your only knowledge of language. If you think
3635040	3639520	about what have I learned about language in my lifetime? It is simply, I have learned that there
3639680	3644400	are nouns and there are verbs and how I'm supposed to string them in a sentence and that I'm not
3644400	3649360	supposed to end my sentences with prepositions or split my infinitives, because I learned this thing
3649360	3654800	in grammar class from the time I was five to the time I'm, you know, 25 or whenever you finish
3654800	3659840	graduate school or whatever you're doing. But we never learn about language as a system. We never
3659840	3665040	learn about language as a science. We never learn about language as a history. But all of those
3665120	3670960	things are what brought language to where it is today. They're, they're so much embedded in the
3670960	3675360	culture of language and the science of language that we could really learn from. And that's what
3675360	3679440	I was trying to do with my book. I'm trying to bring that history and that background and that
3679440	3685360	science out so that people can understand why we say the things we do. Where does light come from?
3685360	3691200	Well, like 300 years old. So it's pretty cool that we still use it today and it's not new. It's
3691200	3695600	not American. It's actually British. So, you know, these really cool little threads that once you
3695600	3700160	untangle them, it opens this whole new way of looking at language. It's very, very cool.
3700160	3704400	Amazing. Valerie, it's been so incredible talking to you. Tell us once again the name of the book
3704400	3708640	and where people can get it. Sure. The name of the book is like literally dude, arguing for the
3708640	3714320	good and bad English. And you can buy it wherever books are sold, Amazon or your local bookstore.
3714880	3719760	That's my preference. If you want to go give them some, some money and some book sales,
3719760	3723200	that would be great. But anywhere books are sold, you can find it. And of course, if you want to
3723200	3728320	buy it through our special bookshop, you can get it at factuallypod.com slash books, factuallypod.com
3728320	3732320	slash books. You'll be supporting not just the show, but also your local bookstore as well,
3732320	3736160	if you buy it from there. Valerie, we didn't even get to talk about dude. I'm afraid that people
3736160	3744880	will have to buy the book in order to learn about it. Dude. Well, dude, dude, I can't believe it.
3744880	3748560	Thank you so much for being here, Valerie. Hope you'll come back again and talk to us about this
3748560	3753280	again sometime. I would love to. And I think I can only end it by saying later, dude. Later, dude.
3755440	3758320	Well, thank you once again to Valerie for coming on the show. Once again,
3758320	3763360	the URL to pick up her book is factuallypod.com slash books. And if you want to support this show,
