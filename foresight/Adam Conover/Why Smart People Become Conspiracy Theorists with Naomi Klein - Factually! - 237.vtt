00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.

00:04.480 --> 00:10.560
This week, I want to talk about an experience that is both weird and weirdly common in 2023 in

00:10.560 --> 00:14.720
the past couple years. You've probably seen it happen to someone around you. Maybe it was a roommate,

00:14.720 --> 00:19.920
a parent, a family friend, or for me, some comedians I started out with. Whoever it was,

00:19.920 --> 00:26.320
the story is the same. Someone who seemed sane with it and living in the same reality as you did

00:26.320 --> 00:33.280
suddenly lost their mind and went down some rabbit hole to emerge as a fully blown conspiracy

00:33.280 --> 00:39.200
theorist. Now, people have been losing their shit like this from time immemorial. As I've covered

00:39.200 --> 00:44.400
before on this show and on Adam ruins everything, conspiratorial thinking follows from the normal

00:44.400 --> 00:49.920
patterns of human thought that we use to understand the world around us. But it seems that there's

00:49.920 --> 00:55.520
something particular and special about the way that people fall into the trap of conspiratorial

00:55.520 --> 01:02.400
thinking now. Whether it starts on 4chan or Fox News, anti-vaxx or QAnon, there's a mirror world

01:02.400 --> 01:08.560
of socially poisonous conspiracy that people keep falling into. It is incredibly painful when it

01:08.560 --> 01:14.080
happens to someone who you know and love and it's often hard to know how to even understand what

01:14.080 --> 01:21.280
happened. What is it about our world, our media, and our politics today that makes this happen

01:21.360 --> 01:28.320
over and over again, the reasonable people who we love and care about? Well, today I have a truly

01:28.320 --> 01:34.080
brilliant guest to help dig into this issue and into the entire mirror world that our politics

01:34.080 --> 01:38.000
and media ecosystem has become. But before we get into it, I just want to remind you that if you

01:38.000 --> 01:43.200
want to support this show, you can do so on Patreon. Head to patreon.com slash Adam Conover.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.520
Five bucks a month gets you every episode of the show ad free. You can hear all the wonderful

01:47.520 --> 01:51.360
interviews we do every single week and you can support other people getting them as well.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.200
And by the way, if you like stand-up comedy, just want to remind you I am a touring stand-up

01:55.200 --> 02:00.400
comedian. I just put a whole bunch of new dates up on my website. In 2024, I am heading to New

02:00.400 --> 02:06.480
York, Boston, Philly, D.C., Portland, Maine, a bunch of other places, Chicago, Nashville,

02:06.480 --> 02:13.040
head to adamconover.net for tickets and tour dates. And now let's get to today's guest because she is

02:13.040 --> 02:17.520
incredible. She's one of the most respected and influential public intellectuals and

02:17.520 --> 02:23.680
nonfiction authors on the left of the past century. Her writings on consumerism, capitalism,

02:23.680 --> 02:28.320
and climate are required reading. And her most recent book is called doppelganger,

02:28.320 --> 02:33.280
a trip into the mirror world. I am, of course, talking about the incredible Naomi Klein and her

02:33.280 --> 02:38.880
new book is a fascinating and personal look into the conspiratorial ways of thinking that are thriving

02:38.880 --> 02:42.880
in the moment we live in today. So without further ado, please welcome Naomi Klein.

02:45.760 --> 02:49.760
Naomi, thank you so much for being on the show. It's a complete thrill to have you.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.880
I'm very happy to be with you. Your books, every time one comes out, they make waves

02:54.880 --> 03:00.800
every single time. This new one, I am so excited about having read the introduction of the first

03:00.800 --> 03:07.120
chapter. It's immediately gripping. You do something that is a form of thinking and communicating

03:07.120 --> 03:11.360
that is very close to my heart. Always interesting to me where you start from

03:11.360 --> 03:17.040
a fascinating personal story and you ladder out from that to a really wide ranging discussion of

03:17.040 --> 03:21.440
the world that we live in today and some really fascinating intellectual issues. It's so cool.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.240
Let's start from the starting point. The book's called doppelganger. Please tell us about your

03:26.240 --> 03:33.200
doppelganger and how it led you on this investigation. Sure. So I do have a doppelganger

03:34.000 --> 03:39.680
by which I mean a person who I am perennially confused and conflated with. Lots of us

03:39.680 --> 03:45.680
have had this experience. I would say mine is more extreme than most. There is another Naomi

03:45.680 --> 03:54.080
nonfiction writer of books who is close to my age and I don't know. We're both Jewish. We're both

03:54.080 --> 04:03.440
named Naomi and we both write books and sort of big ideas, I suppose. You're both cultural critics

04:03.440 --> 04:09.680
as well. Yeah. Her first book, I'm referring to Naomi Wolfe and so lots of viewers, listeners

04:09.680 --> 04:15.920
and viewers might not be familiar with her. She was big in the 90s. She wrote a book called

04:15.920 --> 04:21.440
The Beauty Myth. She worked for Al Gore when he ran for president. She was one of the most

04:21.520 --> 04:26.560
prominent feminists of her generation. She used to be more on the liberal left.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.640
This is why it became a little awkward for me to be confused with her. Now she pales around

04:32.640 --> 04:37.200
with Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson and was a real vector of medical misinformation

04:37.760 --> 04:48.400
during the COVID-19 pandemic. I use her as a case study. We all know people who changed a lot

04:48.400 --> 04:52.720
during COVID. We all know people who we've scratched our heads and gone like, what happened

04:52.720 --> 04:58.320
to that person? Maybe it's like a public figure or maybe it's like a brother or a sister or a

04:58.320 --> 05:06.000
yoga instructor who suddenly is talking about QAnon. I use this experience of identity confusion

05:06.000 --> 05:10.080
because during the pandemic, I would go online and just there would be thousands of people

05:11.040 --> 05:20.960
really angry at me about things that I hadn't done. Because they saw a Naomi on TV saying

05:20.960 --> 05:24.800
something who looks, I mean, if you were next to each other, I could tell the difference,

05:24.800 --> 05:28.080
but if someone hasn't looked at you for a couple years and they see the other,

05:28.080 --> 05:33.600
oh, Brunette, et cetera, same age, et cetera. I always say she has much better hair than me.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.480
It's really important to know.

05:36.480 --> 05:41.120
So people are actually misattributing. Naomi Wolfe was out there saying sometimes horrible

05:41.120 --> 05:44.480
things and they were saying Naomi Klein said this and getting mad at you.

05:44.480 --> 05:49.280
Yeah. Like why is Naomi Klein saying that unvaccinated people have to stay away from

05:49.280 --> 05:53.920
vaccinated people because they might shed vaccine particles onto them and then not be able to have

05:53.920 --> 06:01.680
babies? Things like that. So in the book, I use this identity confusion, which all of us who

06:01.840 --> 06:07.280
have something of a public platform, I think the pandemic had a particular kind of vertigo

06:07.280 --> 06:13.440
because we are used to being in rooms full of other people who help tell us who we are.

06:13.440 --> 06:17.680
Right? Like the last thing, I canceled a book tour. I canceled all these public events.

06:18.240 --> 06:25.600
And so I think that, I think generally we're confused about what our social media avatars are.

06:25.600 --> 06:33.920
Like is that us? Is that really you? It's a sort of an approximation of you.

06:33.920 --> 06:38.640
Like it's a character version of you. It's a branded version of you.

06:39.840 --> 06:46.800
And so I think that I didn't like being confused with her because she was saying a lot of

06:46.800 --> 06:51.360
strange and dangerous things during COVID. But I also think that I was very confused about who

06:51.360 --> 06:57.280
I was during COVID because I wasn't able to do the things that tell me who I am a lot of the time.

06:57.280 --> 07:04.240
Right? So I used it as this kind of portal to get into the weirdness of how we are represented

07:04.240 --> 07:09.280
to the world through our avatars, whether we really believe that each other are real when we

07:09.280 --> 07:15.600
just see these avatar versions of one another. And in a way, that's like she is my doppelganger,

07:15.600 --> 07:22.240
but so is my Twitter avatar. Like that's not really me, whoever that person is performing me on

07:22.240 --> 07:28.320
Twitter. So I think we live in a doppelganger world, especially with AI, where we're not really

07:28.320 --> 07:36.080
sure who and what is real. And so she is a, you know, I guess a kind of a literary device to get

07:36.080 --> 07:40.480
at this hall of mirrors that is contemporary culture. And as soon as you start talking about

07:40.480 --> 07:48.000
that, the number of doppelgangers like starts multiplying in my head because you talk about,

07:48.000 --> 07:53.120
yeah, do you understand yourself, that Twitter avatar as part of you, there's these sort of

07:53.680 --> 07:58.320
strange loss of your own identity you feel when someone confuses you with another person,

07:58.320 --> 08:02.080
you know, when someone, whenever someone says that person looks like you, I'm like,

08:02.080 --> 08:06.880
that's what you think I look like. It's not what I think I look like. Like it's destabilizing just

08:06.880 --> 08:13.200
to be mistaken for another person. In fact, I was once told, I told, this happened to me in

08:13.200 --> 08:17.760
comedy 10 years ago, I told a comic I ran into that she looked like another comic and she said,

08:17.760 --> 08:24.320
no, I don't. And then she said, you should never tell anyone that they look like another person,

08:24.320 --> 08:28.160
because you don't know what the person you're talking to thinks they look like, you know,

08:28.160 --> 08:32.320
you don't know what their self image is and you could be violating their self image in a deep way.

08:32.320 --> 08:36.240
And I always took that to heart and I no longer do that. I no longer say, oh, you kind of look

08:36.240 --> 08:40.800
like this other person because you might be triggering some insecurity the person has or whatever.

08:41.440 --> 08:45.920
It can be very destabilizing to be compared to another person out there.

08:46.400 --> 08:51.360
But, you know, in the end, I decided to embrace it as an unconventional form of,

08:52.640 --> 08:58.480
you know, sort of Zen non-attachment. Because, you know, we live in a culture that is constantly

08:58.480 --> 09:03.520
telling us that we need to perform this perfected version of ourselves and optimize ourselves.

09:03.600 --> 09:08.960
And it's like, you know, it's a kind of our life raft in these extremely competitive waters.

09:08.960 --> 09:15.040
And there's something sort of liberating about realizing that no matter how carefully you tend

09:15.040 --> 09:21.120
to your personal brand and project yourself with the exact right caliber of irony and earnestness,

09:22.160 --> 09:27.680
if thousands of people think that you are somebody totally different, it really is just

09:27.680 --> 09:35.040
telling you like get over yourself, you know. And so I've decided to be grateful for my doppelganger

09:35.040 --> 09:44.400
and to take it as a message to just find other people, find the others, invest in community,

09:45.440 --> 09:49.680
not in personal perfection because people are going to think that you think wild things no

09:49.680 --> 09:53.280
matter what you do. I feel like you've given us the beautiful conclusion of this book at the

09:53.280 --> 09:57.440
beginning of the interview. So maybe we should bleep it for spoilers. I don't know. That's

09:57.440 --> 10:03.440
wonderful. But let's keep exploring. Something else that you said that made me think is, you know,

10:03.440 --> 10:08.640
when our online avatars are those us, are people seeing us when they're looking at us,

10:08.640 --> 10:14.000
that makes me think that when people, you know, lose that screw like Naomi Wolfe did when the

10:14.000 --> 10:18.080
person goes QAnon, when they go anti-vax, when our friend starts behaving in this bizarre way

10:18.880 --> 10:22.960
and starts accusing us of being involved in a conspiracy or seeing those around them,

10:22.960 --> 10:28.080
it often is. Or being a doppelganger of yourself, like stepped for people and stuff.

10:28.080 --> 10:34.240
Yes. Oh, you're not you anymore and they turn it away on you. Well, the pain of that is often

10:34.240 --> 10:40.480
that we no longer feel seen by our friend. The person somehow loses their ability to see us and

10:40.480 --> 10:45.280
to see, you know, when people are really going nuts on Twitter and accusing each other of being,

10:45.280 --> 10:49.760
you know, whatever, vaccine propagandist or whatever, they're not seeing the people they're

10:49.760 --> 10:54.320
talking to as people anymore. And we sort of, it seems like a very modern thing to lose our

10:54.320 --> 11:00.560
ability to see each other as human beings. Yeah. And I mean, it's, it's weird enough when it's

11:00.560 --> 11:06.800
somebody who you don't know, who clearly has you completely wrong. But what's weird as you're saying,

11:06.800 --> 11:11.840
and it's like, when it's somebody who does know you and is suddenly treating you like this,

11:12.480 --> 11:20.560
like entirely two dimensional form. Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of relationships were severed

11:20.560 --> 11:26.240
during during COVID because we were all really stressed out and we were confused. We were anxious.

11:26.880 --> 11:33.040
And so people were disinvited from family dinners and, you know, often for good reasons, you know,

11:33.040 --> 11:39.600
they are immunocompromised and, you know, like, like if you had immunocompromised people in your

11:39.600 --> 11:44.400
family, then you, and you had somebody who was not taking COVID seriously at all, you know,

11:44.400 --> 11:50.240
that's going to create a rift and it created rifts and countless families. But I've also heard some

11:50.240 --> 11:56.000
really nice stories since the book came out of people who, who said that they reached back out

11:56.000 --> 12:02.560
to a sister they lost touch with or, you know, another family member and realized that, you know,

12:02.560 --> 12:06.080
they didn't want to have all these severed connections. And maybe there, there are some

12:06.160 --> 12:11.520
things that they agree on. Maybe they, maybe, maybe you don't like big pharma either for different

12:11.520 --> 12:16.640
reasons, but you might be able to find some common ground and maybe pull them back from what I call

12:16.640 --> 12:24.880
the mirror world. Because, yeah, there's often a, like, you know, I write that conspiracy culture

12:24.880 --> 12:30.640
often gets the facts wrong, but the feelings right. And there's a, there's a way in which there's

12:30.640 --> 12:37.840
always a little bit of truth mixed in with the fantasy in any of the conspiracies. So,

12:38.720 --> 12:43.040
you know, you've got to extend some kind of a bridge where you find, maybe you find some common

12:43.040 --> 12:47.280
ground and give somebody an out because they might be looking for an out. There's a lot of

12:47.280 --> 12:52.160
grifters in there. The fact that you call it the mirror world is just, again, such an evocative

12:52.160 --> 13:00.160
image you found to, that really makes me think about it differently. What, so let's talk about

13:00.160 --> 13:05.920
what is it, do you think that pulls people into that mirror world? Because it's happened with a

13:05.920 --> 13:12.000
lot of events. I saw it happen a friend of mine after 2016, after the pandemic. You know, it seems

13:12.000 --> 13:17.520
like there are these inciting events. And what is it that, that causes this to happen to people?

13:18.240 --> 13:23.360
So I think human beings are creatures of narrative. We like to have stories that,

13:23.360 --> 13:31.680
that tell us who we are and, and where we are. And, and when you have a shock, like a major event

13:31.680 --> 13:38.560
that, that, that scrambles the story of who you thought you were, like 9-11, like a lot of Americans

13:39.280 --> 13:44.080
had no idea who these people were. And that was, that was the question like, why do they hate us?

13:44.080 --> 13:52.480
Like, what is this? You know, we don't do a very good job of teaching what people like geopolitics

13:52.480 --> 13:57.840
in high school, let alone university. So when it turns out that there's like people on the other

13:57.840 --> 14:03.360
side of the planet who are very angry at your country and you, you never learned why, like you

14:03.360 --> 14:10.560
never learned, you didn't even know they were there, right? But after 9-11, I, I wrote a piece,

14:10.560 --> 14:15.120
I remember, I think it was for the LA Times saying, you know, Americans woke up to realize

14:15.120 --> 14:20.960
they were, that they were at war only to find that they had been at war for a long time and no one

14:20.960 --> 14:29.920
told them, you know? So, so I think that we go looking for stories when, when, when our stories

14:29.920 --> 14:35.200
of self fall apart. And, and, and like, I don't know about you, but I've never lived through a

14:35.200 --> 14:41.440
global pandemic before. I've never been told to stay home for months before. This was new terrain.

14:41.440 --> 14:46.720
I've never looked up at the sky and not seen planes of Times Square empty. I mean, these were

14:46.720 --> 14:53.200
shocking events. And so as creatures of story, we go looking for them. And I think what really

14:53.200 --> 14:59.040
derailed us during COVID is that, that search for story intersected with an attention economy.

14:59.040 --> 15:02.240
And it's an economy that means that whoever has the most outrageous

15:02.880 --> 15:08.080
over-claiming story wins the clicks, wins the eyeballs. You know, science takes time.

15:08.080 --> 15:13.280
We were confronting a novel virus. And you had all these scientists saying like, okay, be patient.

15:13.280 --> 15:17.120
We have to go do our research and then we'll get back to you. And then you had a whole bunch of

15:17.120 --> 15:23.840
grifters just rush into that gap saying, we have the story we know come over here. And, you know,

15:23.840 --> 15:27.840
often they were dusting off theories that they had been using in different contexts,

15:27.840 --> 15:34.560
like the anti-vax movement, right? Like they had been spinning stories about childhood vaccines

15:34.560 --> 15:41.680
and autism, which were lies before COVID. But they just needed to kind of do a search and replace

15:42.400 --> 15:47.200
on the COVID vaccines. And they were good to go. Like they didn't have to, you know, so anyway,

15:47.200 --> 15:52.000
so that's some of it. Why do you call, how did you come up with the term the mirror world? And

15:52.000 --> 15:57.360
why do you think of the conspiracy theory world as being a mirror? Well, I was struck, you know,

15:57.360 --> 16:03.440
so I, like, I use my doppelganger as sort of my white rabbit, like in Alice in Wonderland,

16:03.440 --> 16:09.040
to fall down the rabbit hole and really explore the world that she is in now. Because it was either

16:09.040 --> 16:15.840
going to be like, just be horrified by everything she was saying, or, or actually try to understand

16:15.840 --> 16:21.920
like how she could have changed so much. And I'm a researcher. And this is how I understand the

16:21.920 --> 16:29.120
world. Like, you know, when something confounds me, I try to understand it. And so, so I started

16:29.120 --> 16:34.960
listening to a lot of the interviews she was doing with people like Steve Bannon. She was on

16:34.960 --> 16:40.320
his show almost every day for a while. So I listened to hundreds of hours of Steve Bannon's

16:40.320 --> 16:46.560
podcast, The War Room. Wow. And, you know, she was also on like many lesser known.

16:46.560 --> 16:50.240
Did you start to like the podcast after a while? Or are you like, okay, these are like my buddies

16:50.320 --> 16:57.920
now. You get a parasocial relationship with Steve? I admit that I got his theme song

16:57.920 --> 17:05.760
stuck in my head, which is like pretty catchy. It's a very weird anti-China theme song.

17:10.000 --> 17:16.160
But it does end with like, let's take down the CCP. And that's when I knew I was in trouble.

17:16.880 --> 17:21.520
When I just was like, couldn't get it out of my brain when I was doing, you know, unloading the

17:21.520 --> 17:29.600
dishwasher. So, so, but, but I like, I call it the mirror world because I was really struck,

17:29.600 --> 17:36.080
particularly listening to Bannon. One time it was, it was, I remember it was Christmas 2021.

17:36.080 --> 17:46.720
And he was shilling a new coin called FJB, like fuck Joe Biden. And he was just trying to

17:46.720 --> 17:50.800
fleece people before Christmas. He was like, get this for your relatives. And he was making

17:50.800 --> 17:56.160
this whole pitch about how you couldn't trust the dollar anymore. So you had to buy these coins and

17:56.160 --> 18:01.120
so on. Is this cryptocurrency? It wasn't exactly, it was even like, not even crypto. It was just

18:01.200 --> 18:06.560
like literally a coin that said fuck Joe Biden. Like just, like just we made a little, a little

18:06.560 --> 18:12.800
piece of metal disc that says FJB on it. Which is why I say you might be able to get some friends

18:12.800 --> 18:16.800
and family members back from the mirror world because there are so many drifters there, right?

18:16.800 --> 18:22.560
That they might be looking for some kind of help. It's so they're getting fleeced non-stop, right?

18:23.680 --> 18:30.720
Right. You know, send that lifeline, see what happens. But, but as he was making his pitch,

18:31.600 --> 18:36.480
his pre-Christmas pitch, he was saying, you know, we need to have, this is why we need to have our

18:36.480 --> 18:41.680
own money and we need to have our own publishing companies and we need to have our own social

18:41.680 --> 18:47.920
media platforms because we will never cancel you. We will never other you. You'll always be welcome

18:47.920 --> 18:54.960
here. And so, and he was really talking about a one to one, like, you know, get kicked off Twitter,

18:54.960 --> 19:00.160
you can join Getter, which they call themselves the Twitter killer. You know, get kicked off

19:00.160 --> 19:05.920
YouTube, you can join Rumble and so on. And there was, there was like an exact mirror of everything,

19:05.920 --> 19:11.520
like in the world that I lived in. And I was just really struck that most of the people who I know

19:11.520 --> 19:16.880
and hang out with have no idea this world like fully exists. And they actually think that when

19:16.880 --> 19:21.200
somebody gets kicked off the social media that site that they're on that they almost like have been

19:21.200 --> 19:27.040
deleted from planet Earth. And it's so strangely arrogant because actually they're really good

19:27.120 --> 19:33.600
at this. And they are building massive platforms and they're reaching lots of people. And, and

19:33.600 --> 19:37.600
that's, you know, that's why I pay attention to them. They're a major political force, you know.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.320
Steve Bannon is a strategist. He's trying to get back into power.

19:41.040 --> 19:44.640
And these are happening on the public internet. They're not, it's not the dark web. It's like,

19:44.640 --> 19:50.720
you can just go to these websites and look at this stuff. How do you, you know, I know you

19:50.720 --> 19:56.560
tracked Naomi Wolf's progress through the book. How did she fall into this? Because it's, it's a very

19:57.440 --> 20:01.600
even if it weren't for the connection to you, it's a very strange story.

20:01.600 --> 20:07.840
Yeah, it's a strange story because she was such a prominent liberal, such a prominent Democrat,

20:07.840 --> 20:15.120
feminist. How did she fall into it? You know, I have an, I have an equation in the book that might

20:15.120 --> 20:21.440
be useful because I think there's a lot of people who have, who have changed as we, as discussed,

20:22.240 --> 20:33.520
which is social media slash grandiosity plus social media addiction. Many of, I think pretty

20:33.520 --> 20:42.880
much anybody who we might be thinking of spends way too much time online. And plus midlife crisis

20:44.880 --> 20:50.960
divided by public shaming equals right wing meltdown. So I want to talk a bit about the

20:50.960 --> 20:55.680
public shaving piece of it because I, you know, I think one of the big drivers for her is that

20:55.680 --> 21:03.600
she's one of these people who became a spectacle for liberal left Twitter. And that's because she

21:03.600 --> 21:09.520
made a foundational error in a book that she published in 2019. And this error was discovered

21:09.520 --> 21:16.080
live on BBC radio. It's every writer's worst nightmare. I mean, I, I sort of remember this

21:16.080 --> 21:20.000
as a viral moment. And I didn't, I honestly did not really know who she was or really follow her

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
that much, but I, I sort of remember this. What was the error that was discovered?

21:24.000 --> 21:29.920
So she wrote a book called Outrageous. It came out, you know, a few months before the pandemic.

21:31.040 --> 21:38.000
And it was a, it was a, it was a historical work. It was actually her PhD thesis. And it told,

21:40.480 --> 21:47.680
what she, during this interview, she, she made this claim that gay men had been executed

21:48.560 --> 21:55.920
for sodomy long after it was like people thought that they stopped sentencing people to death

21:55.920 --> 22:02.400
for being gay. And what happened in the BBC interviewer pointed out that she had misread

22:02.400 --> 22:07.520
the historical record. And he said, like in a very polite British way, like, it's just the

22:07.520 --> 22:11.520
thing is, is that I think you misunderstood. And then he explained that, and then the bottom

22:11.520 --> 22:17.120
falls out of her entire book. And she, and it turns out that those men had actually been released.

22:18.080 --> 22:25.040
She misunderstood a term called death recorded, which is what she thought was a death sentence,

22:25.040 --> 22:31.840
but it isn't. And so that was just a journalist doing his job. You know, he fact-checked a book

22:31.840 --> 22:35.440
that should have been fact-checked by the author and the publisher and found a massive error.

22:36.080 --> 22:43.840
But then she becomes a meme, you know, then, then people just cannot get enough of this.

22:44.800 --> 22:48.640
And why does she become a meme? Because the, you know, this sounds like

22:49.360 --> 22:52.640
an error is an error. That's embarrassing. Maybe people have a little bit of fun,

22:52.640 --> 22:56.080
but there has to be something deeper going on for people to really go in on that.

22:56.080 --> 23:04.320
You know, I think not really. I mean, I think she was, she was, she was enough of a big deal,

23:05.200 --> 23:07.920
you know, enough of a, you know, New York Times bestselling author

23:08.880 --> 23:14.720
that to watch this happen live on the air. It was just one of those moments where,

23:14.720 --> 23:18.560
because it would be your worst nightmare, and there's a lot of writers on Twitter,

23:18.560 --> 23:22.880
the idea that you could point and laugh at it happening to somebody else somehow made you feel

23:22.880 --> 23:30.160
safer. And, but also she had been dabbling in conspiracy culture, you know, before that,

23:30.160 --> 23:35.280
you know, she had made, she did things like they took pictures of clouds and speculated about

23:35.280 --> 23:42.000
government, you know, yeah, you know, chemtrails and things like that. You know,

23:42.000 --> 23:47.680
she was a bit of a cloud truther. She's, you know, just a little, just a little spot of cloud

23:47.680 --> 23:51.600
truth, just like you're hanging out with her and she might go, Hey, clouds are fake, you know,

23:51.600 --> 23:55.120
and you're like, Oh, well, that was weird that Naomi just sort of tossed that on me. But other

23:55.120 --> 23:58.800
than that, she's pretty nice. Just a bit of a cloud truth of truth. I mean, I think she thinks

23:58.800 --> 24:07.520
birds are real. I'm not sure. So, so, but because there was a little bit of a reservoir of annoyance

24:07.520 --> 24:11.520
with her already online, because she was dabbling in other conspiracy theories, that's why people,

24:11.520 --> 24:16.560
part of why people really went in, it sounds like. Yeah. And then during COVID, I think she was,

24:16.560 --> 24:23.120
we were all bored and at home, and she was like, just endlessly sharing wild theories, like, you

24:23.120 --> 24:28.320
know, like she, she'd, you'd log online and you know, she had like, you know, almost 200,000

24:28.320 --> 24:33.280
followers, you know, it's not like she's like, it didn't have reach. She has many more now.

24:34.320 --> 24:39.200
But she, you know, she'd say that she thinks that children were losing the ability to smile

24:39.200 --> 24:43.120
because they were wearing masks, you know, and then that would be days of entertainment,

24:43.120 --> 24:49.360
things like that. You know, there was a lot about vaccine shedding onto unvaccinated people.

24:49.760 --> 24:57.200
And I mean, but, but I call her a conspiracy influencer, not a conspiracy theorist, because

24:57.200 --> 25:04.160
there are often these glaring contradictions in the claims. Like, you know, for a while, she was

25:04.160 --> 25:14.400
talking about how COVID was a bot, maybe had been cooked up as a bio weapon. But then she was like,

25:14.480 --> 25:19.120
but why wear masks? You know, like, and it's just, it just seems like a bit of a contradiction

25:19.120 --> 25:25.840
there. Like, you know, if it's a bio weapon, surely you should try not to, not to get it, you

25:25.840 --> 25:32.720
know, she's like, so she's an influence. You should be worried about it. Contradicts the

25:32.720 --> 25:38.480
idea that it's not that big a deal. Yeah. So the, the, the story is constantly changing with whatever

25:38.480 --> 25:42.240
is going to get more clicks. So if everyone's supposed to get vaccinated, now the vaccines

25:42.240 --> 25:46.320
are a bio weapon. If everyone's supposed to get an app on their phone to see if they got

25:46.320 --> 25:50.000
vaccinated, well, it's not about the vaccine. It's the app. The app can listen to your phone

25:50.000 --> 25:55.600
conversations and things like that. But this is what I mean about how they often get the feeling

25:55.600 --> 26:00.720
right and the facts wrong is that, you know, that's where she really took a star turn on the right

26:00.720 --> 26:06.320
was when she started talking about those vaccine verification apps, being a covert surveillance

26:07.040 --> 26:15.680
plan. So the truth is like, like people are very anxious about surveillance. They're very anxious

26:15.680 --> 26:19.600
about what happens with their data. They're anxious about their cell phones. They don't really

26:19.600 --> 26:24.480
under, we don't really understand, you know, what is known about our movements, you know,

26:25.520 --> 26:32.720
and so she projected all of our collective surveillance fears onto this one app. But the

26:32.800 --> 26:37.200
response on liberal Twitter was, wait, oh, they hear about cell phones, which is kind of funny,

26:37.200 --> 26:42.240
right? But it's, but the assumption behind that joke is that we all know that our cell phones

26:42.240 --> 26:46.880
are listening to us and we're okay with it. But the thing is, people seem not to be okay with it,

26:46.880 --> 26:52.320
right? So this is part of the appeal of conspiracy culture is that, you know,

26:52.320 --> 26:56.080
they're telling a very simple story. Like if we can just get rid of these apps, then everything

26:56.080 --> 27:00.720
will be fine and nobody will be able to track you anymore, right? Or the vaccines or whatever

27:00.720 --> 27:06.880
is the kind of boogeyman of surveillance, whereas we actually need policy responses

27:06.880 --> 27:11.120
so that we can control these tech companies and they're not able to mine our data endlessly and

27:11.120 --> 27:16.240
create more doppelgangers like AI versions of us and so on. Right. The story with a grain of truth,

27:16.240 --> 27:23.680
but with a much simpler solution and you can apply it to almost anything. Now, often when someone

27:23.680 --> 27:29.040
is a conspiracy influencer like this, there'll be this implication that people will say, oh,

27:29.040 --> 27:34.240
they're a grifter and a grifter generally means someone who doesn't believe anything that they say.

27:34.240 --> 27:38.160
They're just trying to get the clicks. They're harvesting clicks. They're like following the

27:38.160 --> 27:44.160
audience. Did you feel that that was the case in her case? Was she a complete cynic about it? Or

27:44.160 --> 27:48.960
do you think she was believing these things and was just not able to sort of connect the dots

27:48.960 --> 27:55.360
that they were self contradictory? It's very hard for me to know what she believes, right? And I

27:55.360 --> 28:01.360
think that a lot of people who really go all in with conspiracy culture aren't completely cynical.

28:01.360 --> 28:09.520
They have to convince themselves of some of it on some level. But that doesn't mean that the primary

28:09.520 --> 28:17.200
impulse isn't grifting, isn't ego, isn't getting people to treat you like a savant or whatever.

28:18.080 --> 28:22.000
I think she gets a lot out of this, I guess is what I'm saying. I think she lost a lot

28:22.320 --> 28:29.840
in the world that she used to travel in. She could no longer get published. After that error on BBC,

28:29.840 --> 28:36.240
her publisher dropped her, dumped her book. So she had every reason to move to a new market

28:36.880 --> 28:43.920
that is very large. Tucker Carlson, when he had her on Fox, he was getting 3 million viewers a

28:43.920 --> 28:51.760
night. There's no show on the left that she had access to that could go near that. So there's

28:51.760 --> 29:00.080
every reason. So I don't know what she believes, but I do know that a lot of people who follow this

29:00.080 --> 29:05.760
are not just grifting, right? The only reason the grift is successful if it's a grift is because

29:05.760 --> 29:12.000
there are lots of customers who sincerely are listening to Steve Bannon and Naomi Wolfe and

29:12.000 --> 29:19.920
RFK Jr. and believe it, or else it's not a good grift. You don't have customers. So it's worrying

29:19.920 --> 29:28.080
because they're using such apocalyptic language. And if you really are in this battle for humanity

29:28.080 --> 29:34.720
against a genocide, that's the kind of language that she uses, good and evil. She's claimed that

29:34.720 --> 29:41.040
there is a genocide that has happened because of these vaccines. I think that it, and she also

29:41.040 --> 29:46.320
takes pictures of her new gun and says we're at war and post-pictures of her husband doing target

29:46.320 --> 29:53.200
practice. So this doesn't end well, I guess is what I'm saying. If you're telling people they are

29:53.200 --> 29:58.480
fighting a genocide for good and evil, I think they might take you at your word, whether you're

29:58.480 --> 30:03.120
grifting or not, and they might decide to do something about it. And we're seeing lots of

30:03.120 --> 30:08.000
examples of that actually. We absolutely are. Well, we have to take a really quick break. When we

30:08.000 --> 30:12.160
come back, I want to ask you more about how this has changed your own interaction with your online

30:12.480 --> 30:16.320
editing. We'll be right back with more Naomi Klein. You know, the year is never more hectic

30:16.320 --> 30:20.240
than during the holiday season with all those travel plans, work projects, wrapping up. And

30:20.240 --> 30:23.920
if you run a household, it's sometimes even hard to remember what's for dinner or if anyone's

30:23.920 --> 30:28.160
remembered to feed the dog. If this sounds like your home or the home of someone you know,

30:28.160 --> 30:32.480
this holiday season is the time for the gift of organization with the skylight calendar.

30:32.480 --> 30:36.720
The skylight calendar is a smart touchscreen calendar and organizer for all of your chores,

30:36.720 --> 30:41.040
groceries, and to-dos. It automatically syncs all of the different digital calendars and events

30:41.040 --> 30:46.160
your family uses and shows them all together on one beautiful touchscreen display. Skylight

30:46.160 --> 30:51.200
calendar is the best way to give your family peace of mind to enjoy the things that matter most.

30:51.200 --> 30:55.680
It works by syncing events from already existing calendars you have, including Google,

30:55.680 --> 30:59.680
Outlook, and Apple calendars. You can also add events directly using the touchscreen

30:59.680 --> 31:05.120
or with the free skylight mobile app. And it shows all family events together in one spot

31:05.120 --> 31:09.920
so you can see what everyone has going on each week. Families are more likely to actually check

31:09.920 --> 31:15.040
it since it's always up to date and so they don't question mom every day about schedules.

31:15.040 --> 31:19.840
And additional fun features include dinner planning, grocery list, daily weather display,

31:19.840 --> 31:24.320
and weather forecast based on the address of your events. And plus, when it's not in use,

31:24.320 --> 31:30.080
you can even turn it into a digital picture frame. And get this, as a special limited time offer for

31:30.080 --> 31:35.680

31:48.080 --> 31:51.680
Okay, we're back with Naomi Klein talking about online conspiracy theories,

31:51.680 --> 31:56.720
the mirror world, doppelgangers. You had this really intriguing idea at the top of the interview

31:56.720 --> 32:02.320
about how it made you think about how your own online identity is in some ways a doppelganger.

32:02.320 --> 32:07.760
Can you please get into that for us? So, I think when we create an online

32:08.560 --> 32:12.640
version of ourselves, when we choose the picture that's going to be our avatar,

32:12.640 --> 32:19.920
when we write that sort of like kind of satirical bio, like we are creating a brand.

32:21.040 --> 32:30.960
And what is a brand? A brand is a thing version of you, of me. And this is actually

32:31.680 --> 32:37.600
the first book I wrote when I was in my 20s was a book called No Logo. And it was about the rise

32:37.600 --> 32:45.600
of this idea that companies should first and foremost most be selling an idea, a brand,

32:45.600 --> 32:50.160
not that the product was incidental, which was an idea that took root in corporate culture in

32:50.160 --> 32:56.240
the 90s, but also that individual celebrities like the first person who called himself,

32:56.240 --> 33:03.440
whose agent called him a super brand was Michael Jordan. And he was a mega corporation.

33:04.400 --> 33:12.000
And there were others, there was Richard Branson and Oprah, of course. But the idea that regular

33:12.000 --> 33:18.880
people could be brands was not possible at that stage, even though there were kind of management

33:18.880 --> 33:22.800
consultants saying this is the future and you're not going to get a job, you're just going to have

33:22.800 --> 33:28.000
a series of contracts. But if you really want to get ahead, you need to create a brand. And so

33:30.160 --> 33:36.800
that didn't become a reality until social media put advertising agencies into all of our back

33:36.800 --> 33:45.280
pockets, right? Because suddenly you two can do this for free, like for the price of your phone.

33:46.240 --> 33:52.000
And what I'm trying to do in the book is look at it with a little bit of

33:53.360 --> 34:00.800
distance, because I think people are often called out for being performative and being

34:00.800 --> 34:08.400
inauthentic online and so on. This is like the ultimate smear is like you're just performing,

34:08.400 --> 34:13.840
but we're all just performing. And the reason we're doing it is because we have all received

34:13.840 --> 34:21.360
this message that the perfected performed self, the brand itself, is really our only hope of

34:21.360 --> 34:32.000
survival in these incredibly competitive, shark-fist-laden waters. So yeah, I think we should

34:32.000 --> 34:36.720
treat ourselves with a little bit of compassion and thinking about why we build these doppelgangers

34:36.720 --> 34:43.200
of ourselves. But a brand is a thing, like humans are not meant to be brands. We've accepted the

34:43.200 --> 34:48.320
logic and we're all doing it. And that's why we think we all need to issue press statements

34:48.320 --> 34:54.800
whenever anything terrible happens in the world. Right. That is where I went as well, because

34:54.800 --> 35:00.480
there's a lot of that happening right now with people saying, you need to post about this. You

35:00.480 --> 35:05.040
need to post. You need to speak up. And it's at that moment that the distance between... You don't,

35:05.040 --> 35:10.320
by the way. Do you don't. Thank you. I agree. I don't think anyone can force you to post,

35:10.320 --> 35:14.720
and I don't think that posting is good by itself. Posting can be something, but it's not...

35:14.720 --> 35:19.120
And people will try to shame you into it. Your silence is its own statement and so on.

35:19.120 --> 35:24.880
And they're just performing themselves, like that version, whoever those people are who are

35:24.880 --> 35:30.080
calling you out for not having issued a press statement about the Middle East.

35:32.000 --> 35:37.280
Like unless you are a politician, unless you are a public person with some kind of record,

35:37.280 --> 35:41.280
you don't owe that to the world. I think you should read. You should become

35:43.120 --> 35:49.200
literate about these issues that are going to impact all of us. But if this is not your area,

35:49.200 --> 35:55.360
you do not owe anybody that sort of us versus them performance.

35:55.360 --> 36:00.480
Correct. And I felt that really strongly... Well, it made me think about the distance

36:00.480 --> 36:06.960
between my brand and my personal self, because I have a large social media presence.

36:06.960 --> 36:11.040
There are things that I post about a lot. What I don't post about international affairs,

36:11.040 --> 36:17.760
that's not part of my brand. Now, as a person, I have a responsibility to check in on my friends

36:17.760 --> 36:22.400
who are affected to learn as much as I can to try to, et cetera, et cetera. But there's a big

36:23.360 --> 36:27.600
gap there. And I really was really feeling the gap over those last couple of weeks.

36:27.600 --> 36:31.760
Yeah. And I think people feel... You start to feel like somebody's keeping track.

36:31.840 --> 36:36.640
Like there's some list somewhere that's keeping track of everybody who has said

36:36.640 --> 36:40.400
something, everyone who has said nothing, and we don't want to be on the wrong list.

36:40.400 --> 36:46.080
Wait it out is all I can say. Just wait it out. And certainly don't say anything if you don't

36:46.080 --> 36:54.400
know what you're talking about. But the point about this idea of that a brand is a thing version

36:54.400 --> 37:01.680
of you is a bad way to be human. I have studied what it means to be a good

37:01.840 --> 37:06.960
brand. And what it means to be a good brand is to repeat yourself endlessly and have

37:06.960 --> 37:12.640
extreme message discipline. So if you are a good brand as a human being, you are incredibly boring.

37:13.520 --> 37:19.360
You do not evolve. And you basically are just like a dog chasing its own tail for the rest of your

37:19.360 --> 37:24.240
life. You're just Nike. You say, just do it. Just do it. Just do it. Just do it over and over again.

37:24.240 --> 37:27.680
Yeah. Yeah. Just change the celebrity, keep the slogan.

37:28.640 --> 37:36.560
Yeah. Good branding is all about discipline. And that may work for Nike, but it is

37:37.360 --> 37:43.280
really not what one should look for in our attempts to be human, which is to actually evolve and

37:43.280 --> 37:52.240
learn from our experiences and reserve the right to change. And it's interesting because it relates

37:52.240 --> 38:00.160
to AI because I think the more formulaic we are as people, as artists, as creators of any kind,

38:00.160 --> 38:06.960
the easier we are to make a doppelganger of us by AI because AI studies formulas,

38:06.960 --> 38:13.680
as you got to keep some machines guessing. Be a bad brand. Break their own formula.

38:13.680 --> 38:19.680
But I also think it relates to the cruelty, you know, because a brand is not a human. A brand

38:19.680 --> 38:26.640
is a thing. And I think that when we're all out there performing thing versions of ourselves,

38:27.520 --> 38:33.600
we start to forget that each other are humans. And then we start to throw very sharp things at one

38:33.600 --> 38:38.640
another. And then we're surprised when we hurt each other because things don't bleed, right?

38:38.640 --> 38:42.720
You can just, you can hurl anything you want at Nike. That'll be fine.

38:42.720 --> 38:47.120
Do you feel that you've created a brand for yourself? Is that, did you say, oh, wait,

38:47.120 --> 38:52.640
hold on. I am a brand in a way that I'm no longer comfortable with as you were looking into this?

38:52.640 --> 38:56.720
Yeah. I mean, this was a question that came up for me pretty early because my first book,

38:56.720 --> 39:05.040
I got really, really fortunate with my first book. And NoLogo became a brand in the world. And it

39:05.040 --> 39:12.240
was very awkward because it was this anti-branding book that suddenly, like, there's a NoLogo craft

39:12.240 --> 39:18.880
beer in England. There's, there was a whole line of Italian sundries, including some very

39:18.880 --> 39:24.880
good olive oil in Italy called NoLogo. And then there was like a restaurant in Geneva called

39:24.880 --> 39:30.160
NoLogo, which I went into. I was like, wow, there's a NoLogo restaurant. And I went in and I

39:30.160 --> 39:35.040
introduced myself to the owner who ran away. He was so panicked that I was going to stew over

39:35.040 --> 39:41.760
something that I had decided not to trademark it because I thought that that compromised my ethics.

39:41.760 --> 39:45.280
Anyway, I was like, in my 20s, I could have gotten so rich.

39:47.920 --> 39:51.760
Well, yeah, it became a meme, NoLogo. It was everywhere.

39:51.760 --> 39:57.920
Yeah. So I, you know, I was confronted with this tension early on of like, okay, so even if I didn't

39:57.920 --> 40:02.640
want to be a brand, but I did sort of want to be a brand. And then I just realized it got way

40:02.640 --> 40:07.760
beyond my control. So I just decided to try to become a bad brand. And then the next, for me,

40:07.760 --> 40:13.920
what that meant was not writing that marketing for another 20 years. So I, you know, my next books,

40:13.920 --> 40:22.800
my next books were really not sequels to NoLogo, the shock doctrine, and this changes everything.

40:22.800 --> 40:28.240
They were, you know, I just, because I thought to be a good researcher, to be a good investigative

40:28.240 --> 40:33.440
journalist, I have to follow my, I have to follow the research and not just chase my tail.

40:33.440 --> 40:37.360
And it was very clear to me that some writers just write the same book over and over again

40:37.360 --> 40:41.680
and slightly change the title. I mean, they're franchises. It's very popular. But to me,

40:42.720 --> 40:47.040
it was never really an option because I don't have the discipline to write about things that

40:47.040 --> 40:52.640
are not interesting to me. Like, I'm too lazy for that, you know, it has to interest me.

40:53.600 --> 40:59.280
I have to not understand it and have this desire to understand it to keep me working.

40:59.280 --> 41:03.200
And the thing about being a good branded author is you've already figured out the formula and then

41:03.200 --> 41:08.800
you just have to repeat it. But to me, writing is too hard to do that, you know? Like, if I'm not

41:08.800 --> 41:15.520
in a process of discovery, I will just watch television, you know? So it wasn't so much like

41:15.520 --> 41:20.000
that I was so pure. It was truly not an option for me. I mean, I guess I could have,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.800
now I could have hired an AI to write those books for me.

41:22.800 --> 41:27.600
Well, it seems like you also, you had an urge to resist it, which I deal with that in my own work.

41:27.600 --> 41:31.920
I have my pet topics I return to again and again, anyone who listens to this show knows

41:31.920 --> 41:37.600
what they are. I don't need to list them. But then, you know, I have an urge to get away from

41:37.600 --> 41:41.680
that and do something new. But then the problem is, well, how do you sell that? Because people

41:41.680 --> 41:48.080
know you for the thing that you just did, right? People know you for that. And so maybe they want

41:48.080 --> 41:51.920
more of it. I mean, even this book seems very different that it starts from such a place of

41:51.920 --> 41:54.880
personal history of like, hey, this weird thing happened to me compared to...

41:54.880 --> 42:00.800
Yeah. Well, I think any kind of success is always going to create its own trap, right? I mean,

42:00.800 --> 42:06.480
that's like Dylan, you know, going electric. Like, people didn't want that from him. And

42:06.480 --> 42:15.920
then that's why he had to do it, you know? So, but with this book, I, it was similar in the sense

42:16.000 --> 42:23.280
that I couldn't bring myself to write a conventional nonfiction book again, because I had lost faith

42:23.840 --> 42:32.720
that argument changed minds. I had lost faith in the concept of a linear nonfiction argument

42:32.720 --> 42:39.520
based book. Life was just getting too weird. And so I just thought, well, maybe I can write in a

42:39.520 --> 42:43.760
complete, in a really different way. And, you know, this book is much straight, it's weirder,

42:43.760 --> 42:48.800
but we live in weirder times. And it uses my own double to, to go into a hall of mirrors. And I

42:48.800 --> 42:54.800
think that if I had tried to write about this, the weirdness of now, as if I was outside of it,

42:54.800 --> 42:58.960
and just be like, I'm now going to make an argument about doppelgangers.

42:58.960 --> 43:04.640
No, no, who would want to read that? Like, what's fun is to read about a hurricane from inside its

43:04.640 --> 43:12.320
eye, you know? Oh, I love that. I love that. And to explore, yeah, what does this, what does this

43:12.320 --> 43:17.520
mean? What does this word mean? And to explore the hall of mirrors from inside the hall of mirrors,

43:17.520 --> 43:21.920
like to join you right there and to like try to get out, try to get out, you know,

43:22.880 --> 43:29.520
but you got to start inside. Do you have any belief that that project can change minds more

43:29.520 --> 43:36.720
than the linear argumentative essay can? You know, I have found that like I've, I've, I have

43:37.600 --> 43:46.080
received so many really beautiful responses to this book of people who are grateful to have a kind

43:46.080 --> 43:54.000
of a map of, you know, this dynamic with the mirror world where we're defining ourselves against

43:54.000 --> 44:01.200
one another and projecting everything we can't stand about ourselves onto them, you know,

44:01.200 --> 44:08.960
and then feeling pure because we are not them. And, you know, I think, you know, even something,

44:08.960 --> 44:14.960
having a term like the mirror world, I have found like all a writer can do, I always see my role,

44:14.960 --> 44:22.560
it's it as helping people read the news better. I know this as a sort of a strange like a job

44:22.560 --> 44:29.040
I've assigned, but to myself, but like, I don't, I don't have grand ambitions about what books can

44:29.040 --> 44:36.320
do on their own. But I do think that that we can provide a little bit of orientation and some

44:36.320 --> 44:42.720
language, right? Like, like with a shock doctrine, I gave people some terms to describe what happens

44:42.720 --> 44:47.440
when we're in a state of shock, and people try to take advantage of it. They try to push through a

44:47.440 --> 44:52.160
preexisting wish list, right? And so whenever there's a disaster, people, I start hearing people say,

44:52.160 --> 44:56.960
well, it's, it's the shock doctrine, it's they're, they're doing disaster capitalism. And I think,

44:56.960 --> 45:03.520
okay, I helped people just get oriented a little more quickly. It's not nothing, you know, like,

45:03.520 --> 45:08.880
I, yeah, that's, that's all I can do. I think there are more, there's more that we can do

45:08.880 --> 45:14.640
that are not books that mostly involve organizing with one another in the real world.

45:14.640 --> 45:20.960
Yeah. Well, but to create a piece of language that can help people understand the world more

45:20.960 --> 45:25.920
quickly is a powerful thing to do. It's as you say, it's maybe a small contribution in the,

45:26.000 --> 45:32.240
in the overall world of language, right, or, or of our concepts, but it, it does give people

45:32.800 --> 45:38.960
a new verb almost a new way of, of relating. I want to return to that point of organizing,

45:38.960 --> 45:45.920
because I obviously believe that strongly as well. But the online world, I'm curious how you

45:46.480 --> 45:52.560
feel about it, because there's a, there's a, just a little aside early in the book,

45:52.560 --> 45:58.000
where you say something like, oh, I dismissed that as happening just online and not in the

45:58.000 --> 46:02.720
real world. You know, I was so naive back then we were all naive enough to still say things like

46:02.720 --> 46:09.760
that. And what's weird to me is I lately have found myself saying, oh, that's just happening online

46:09.760 --> 46:15.280
more. You know, I've, I've been on the internet my entire life, literally since I was, you know,

46:15.280 --> 46:21.440
very young, I was obsessed with the internet with the computer world and like dwelled there.

46:21.440 --> 46:26.480
And now over the last couple of years, I've been like, I want to be on the computer as little as

46:26.480 --> 46:31.600
possible. I want to go look at a fucking tree. I want to go like, you know, be, do comedy with

46:31.600 --> 46:35.760
people in a room. I want to meet people face to face. I like, I hate zoom meetings. I want to,

46:35.760 --> 46:41.040
like, I will go 45 minutes to meet you in person, you know, that's just been my own,

46:42.720 --> 46:48.160
my own orientation. And yet we do at the same time live in a world where you can't say, oh,

46:48.160 --> 46:52.560
that's just Twitter or you can't. I'm not sure. How do you feel about it?

46:53.760 --> 47:03.840
I mean, I think like you, I am drawn to the real to the embodied spaces. You know, I live in an

47:03.840 --> 47:10.800
incredibly beautiful part of the world in in coastal British Columbia, where there are many

47:10.800 --> 47:20.640
trees to spend time with. And you know, it is really literally grounding. And I don't think

47:20.640 --> 47:26.240
that I could do the kind of work that I do if I wasn't able to balance it out with a hike in the

47:26.240 --> 47:35.840
forest or some time on the water. And since this book came out, like being in rooms full of other

47:35.840 --> 47:42.640
people has felt incredibly nourishing after so much time away. And I think this is how we keep

47:42.640 --> 47:50.240
each other sane in these in these very vertiginous times. We are creatures of narrative, like I

47:50.240 --> 47:55.520
said, and we we do that work together, you know, we make sense of the world together. And I don't

47:55.520 --> 48:00.080
think we can do it just in a zoom meeting. I think there's something irreplaceable about doing it

48:00.160 --> 48:08.640
with one another. And so I the way I try to use social media is as a way to get people off social

48:08.640 --> 48:17.280
media. So like, come on over, you know, yeah, join the picket line and, you know, and, and, and go to

48:17.280 --> 48:23.440
the rally and come to this meeting and come to this event and go to this concert and read this

48:23.440 --> 48:30.160
book, you know, and, you know, get wherever the work is deeper than whatever the little box Elon

48:30.160 --> 48:36.560
Musk has given us, you know, whatever that little box is or Mark Zuckerberg. So when I see a lot of

48:36.560 --> 48:42.560
people using it in that way, right, to bring us to more to to more deeper work that more fully

48:42.560 --> 48:48.080
represents us whatever that is. And sometimes it'll be embodied with one another. And sometimes it'll

48:48.080 --> 48:58.560
be, you know, just offline. So that's the way I tend to relate to it. I really like that. I, you

48:58.560 --> 49:02.720
know, I became well known over the past year for posting from the Writers Guild picket line quite

49:02.720 --> 49:08.800
often. And I was that was to me a very beneficial use of social media because people became connected

49:08.800 --> 49:13.040
to our struggle and they were able to offer support and and just telling, you know, showing

49:13.040 --> 49:17.040
people what was happening was important. But I think it was really important that

49:17.040 --> 49:22.000
I was doing it from the picket line. You know, I was like, here I am surrounded by other people

49:22.000 --> 49:27.200
and you can see what is happening here in the real world. I'm on the street in front of Netflix.

49:27.200 --> 49:32.240
And here's hundreds of people around me or we're at a rally, etc. If I had been doing that from my

49:32.240 --> 49:37.520
bedroom, you know, if that if that was where the struggle was taking place, all of us on the internet,

49:37.520 --> 49:42.080
it wouldn't, first of all, he wouldn't have won. It wouldn't have been as powerful, but it also

49:42.080 --> 49:47.600
wouldn't have, it wouldn't have mattered like the the connecting to, you know, the real life

49:47.600 --> 49:53.120
physical organizing mattered so much. And when you're doing that face to face, you see how powerful

49:53.120 --> 49:56.960
it is to see someone who you're in, you know, struggle with and you see them face to face and

49:56.960 --> 50:01.920
you give them a hug and you say you need some water and you like have a connection. It's just

50:01.920 --> 50:07.920
funny though, because so in all this about return to work, so many people make fun of bosses for

50:07.920 --> 50:12.400
going, oh, the ineffable synergy of being in the office together and people would make fun of those

50:12.400 --> 50:15.680
bosses for requiring people to go back to the office. And part of me would go, I do kind of

50:15.680 --> 50:22.640
believe it though a little bit. Like I do agree face to face has something irreplaceable.

50:23.360 --> 50:27.120
But talking about nobody wants to go back to their workplaces, it probably means that their

50:27.120 --> 50:31.840
workplaces sucked in, you know, they need to change their workplace culture. And that's another

50:31.840 --> 50:37.280
argument for organizing, but I love that description because, you know, all of these ways,

50:37.280 --> 50:42.880
like ways of building doubles of ourselves, right? Like whether we're optimizing, we're

50:42.880 --> 50:48.640
perfecting our brand or we're, you know, I talk about the optimized body as being a kind of

50:48.640 --> 50:54.960
doubling, right? Like the idealized form. And this is, you know, part of what pushed a lot of people

50:54.960 --> 50:59.520
over the edge during COVID was this idea that they had a strong body, a strong immune system,

50:59.520 --> 51:03.680
so they didn't need to worry about other people. And they didn't, you know, they didn't have to

51:03.680 --> 51:09.680
think about being in this enmeshed, you know, world of other people. Or they see their kids as

51:09.680 --> 51:15.760
their little mini-mes, their little doppelgangers, but all of it is about the self as opposed to

51:15.760 --> 51:25.600
building collective power. And, you know, when we are trying to face huge collective problems

51:25.600 --> 51:31.520
as individuals, that's when we feel most powerless, right? And we feel ashamed, you know,

51:31.520 --> 51:35.200
because we can't seem to make ends meet, despite the fact that we're working so hard,

51:35.200 --> 51:40.800
or we're carrying this debt, you know, or we have this terrible boss. And the power of the

51:40.800 --> 51:46.720
demonstration, you know, and this is really where the book ends, quoting my friend, Keyanga Yamada

51:46.720 --> 51:52.480
Taylor, who teaches history at Princeton, and also quoting the late, great John Berger about

51:52.480 --> 52:00.720
the power of the demonstration is not just that you demonstrate to those in power at Netflix

52:00.720 --> 52:06.240
or wherever, that there's a lot of you. It's that you demonstrate to one another that you are not

52:06.240 --> 52:14.240
alone, that you are, that what felt individual, like an individual crisis for you, because you

52:14.240 --> 52:18.560
couldn't pay the bills, is actually a collective crisis. It's actually a crisis for your boss

52:19.200 --> 52:24.080
when all, when everybody gets together and withholds their labor or withholds their rent,

52:24.080 --> 52:31.200
you know, in a tenants union, or withholds their debt payments in a debtor's union.

52:32.080 --> 52:40.080
So that's why we need to get over ourselves, right? That is why I'm grateful to my doppelganger,

52:40.080 --> 52:45.920
because I think I care, like all of us, I care too much about my own image. I who the hell cares,

52:45.920 --> 52:51.360
you know? So people confuse me with somebody else. And that's that I take that as a message to just

52:51.360 --> 52:54.880
get over myself and reach towards other people, build collective power.

52:54.880 --> 53:00.240
Oh, I love that. It makes me think of this thought that I've had recurringly over the

53:00.240 --> 53:03.840
past couple of years, which is that when you're face to face with other people,

53:04.560 --> 53:09.920
they see you in a way that you can't control. I think about this as a stand-up comedian who I

53:09.920 --> 53:13.760
perform live in front of other people and I watch other stand-up comedians. And when I think about

53:13.760 --> 53:19.520
how the audience regards you on stage, they're looking right at you. You're exposed in front

53:19.520 --> 53:23.120
of them. You can try to put up whatever front you want. And a lot of people can put up a front

53:23.120 --> 53:29.280
quite well. But the audience is gay is always pierces to something that you don't control,

53:29.280 --> 53:33.680
you know? I feel that people are able to, you know, when we're present for each other,

53:33.680 --> 53:39.680
we see each other in this sort of like deeper uncontrollable way. And maybe that's why it's a

53:39.680 --> 53:44.560
relief to be in person, because we, you know, on the internet, it's all artifice, right? It's all

53:44.560 --> 53:50.080
anybody sees as what I control. And it's actually helpful to be in a situation where I'm not totally

53:50.080 --> 53:57.360
in control. And then I get, I get seen as a person, which is satisfying and sort of lumpy and weird,

53:57.360 --> 54:02.080
even though it's, I don't have control over, it's a little scary, but it is ultimately so much more,

54:02.080 --> 54:06.480
there's more fucking going on there. Well, and well, they will also do things you can't control,

54:06.480 --> 54:13.440
right? Like, and that's, that's a whole other thing. But it is, it's, I mean, this is the thing

54:13.440 --> 54:18.160
about, I think there's certain things about the tools of technology that are habit forming, you

54:18.160 --> 54:24.560
know, that when you can mute somebody, you know, and just, or just block, like, like there's something

54:24.560 --> 54:30.480
habit forming about the idea that you can just make inconvenient people disappear. Which, look,

54:30.480 --> 54:34.800
I'm a muter. I admit it. Like when someone's putting me in a bad mood, I'll mute them. I don't

54:34.800 --> 54:41.280
block. It's so much more than the satisfaction. You can't block, but it's so fun to follow someone

54:41.280 --> 54:45.920
and then mute them and be like, they don't know that they're muted. They still think I follow them.

54:46.640 --> 54:48.880
They're still yelling at me and they think I hear them.

54:51.520 --> 54:58.080
But it is, it's a sick thing to take pleasure in. Because when you are in a room with other

54:58.080 --> 55:02.720
people, you realize that you can't turn them off. Like they are going to be, they're all fully human

55:02.720 --> 55:06.480
selves, right? And this is why we need gun control.

55:17.760 --> 55:23.600
I love we're having this very, like, airy philosophical argument about seeing each other

55:23.600 --> 55:28.160
and control and identity and persona and you're like, and that's my policy argument for an assault

55:28.160 --> 55:31.920
weapons ban. Because I want to have a debate. I just don't want it to end that way. You know what I

55:32.000 --> 55:40.960
mean? I love it so much. And this again, it connects to so many things that I've been thinking about

55:40.960 --> 55:45.120
who I am and how I move through the world and what I do. It sounds like it's too high and I

55:45.120 --> 55:50.640
start wigging out about my online identity and stuff. And this is helping me giving me a framework

55:50.640 --> 55:59.040
to think about it, which I think is your goal. So do you have any to bring us in for a landing here?

55:59.520 --> 56:06.720
You know, concrete, like, steps that you take away from this journey that you went on with

56:06.720 --> 56:12.720
Ms. Wolfe and everything that you learned about the mirror world? Like, how do we, especially

56:13.360 --> 56:16.800
if we talk about those people who are really trapped within it and we want to connect back

56:16.800 --> 56:20.160
to them? Because I have so many friends who've experienced the pain of that. I have friends

56:20.160 --> 56:26.880
who've lost parents to QAnon who they can't speak to anymore. And to that mirror world, what do we

56:26.880 --> 56:37.600
do? Well, so all the research shows that if somebody is going to get out of that mirror world,

56:37.600 --> 56:44.400
you know, if they're going to get away from Steve Bannon or whoever it is that they have adopted as

56:44.400 --> 56:51.280
a guru, it's going to be somebody who they have a preexisting relationship with who will have reached

56:51.280 --> 56:55.600
them. And like I said, this world is full of grifters. They're getting fleeced all the time.

56:55.680 --> 57:00.000
The stories are changing all the time. They probably have questions. Some people are too

57:00.000 --> 57:05.280
far gone, but there may well be people who are looking for an off-ramp. And it's not going to

57:05.280 --> 57:10.480
be my book that's going to get them. It's going to be a friend from high school who maybe read my

57:10.480 --> 57:16.560
book and had some ideas for how to extend a bridge and find some common ground. Like I said,

57:17.440 --> 57:21.680
I don't like Bill Gates. I don't think he's implanting us with chips.

57:22.240 --> 57:29.280
I just think he's a fucking asshole who made his billions in a horrible way and then is bad to

57:29.280 --> 57:33.600
people and created a propaganda machine about how great he is, where he made his own Netflix

57:33.600 --> 57:38.880
documentary about how he's the smartest guy in the world. Exactly. There's so many reasons

57:38.880 --> 57:47.280
to hate Bill Gates without making anything up. He's mean to his wife. He's an asshole husband,

57:47.280 --> 57:55.120
isn't he? He hangs around with Jeffrey Epstein, if I recall. So I do think that it is worth

57:55.120 --> 57:59.200
extending those bridges, but I don't think we're going to solve this one uncle at a time.

58:00.080 --> 58:09.360
And I do think if you listen to how these right-wing populists are gaining ground,

58:09.360 --> 58:16.080
it's by mixing and matching some true things with some very dangerous and untrue things,

58:16.480 --> 58:23.280
great replacement theory. And the immigrants are coming to replace you and teachers are turning

58:23.280 --> 58:31.280
your kids' trends. So they'll take something like a fear of surveillance or rightful suspicion of

58:31.280 --> 58:38.800
Big Pharma and they'll mix and match it with this much more nefarious agenda. So what we can do is

58:38.800 --> 58:46.240
we can take away the true things that they're like, we can take them back and put them to work

58:46.240 --> 58:52.240
in a real progressive project. So I don't think we fight conspiracy culture by just like de-platforming

58:52.240 --> 58:58.080
and content moderation. And I'm not saying that there's no role for that. But I think that

58:58.080 --> 59:04.080
Sean Fain, the head of the UAW, has done more to fight conspiracy culture just being out there in

59:04.080 --> 59:09.520
his eat the rich t-shirt and saying, you know, record profits should mean record contracts

59:09.520 --> 59:17.040
and like being an actual left populist with a plan, an organizing plan for how to actually

59:17.040 --> 59:21.360
meet people's needs. Because what conspiracy culture is, is a distraction machine. It takes

59:21.360 --> 59:29.600
people's anger at elites, feeling that they're being screwed over. And it pivots it towards

59:29.600 --> 59:34.560
scapegoats, right? So the best way to fight it actually is to give people a real economic project

59:34.560 --> 59:38.800
that's going to meet their needs so they are less likely to fall for these counterfeit grifters.

59:38.800 --> 59:45.120
Absolutely right. To say, hey, the feeling that you have is real. There needs to be a fight,

59:45.120 --> 59:50.160
but to actually wage the right fight and don't just pay it lip service, but organize

59:50.160 --> 59:56.720
Marshall the power. I mean, Sean Fain has power in the UAW and he is winning and people can,

59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.960
hey, don't you feel like you're getting screwed? Everybody says, yes, let's fucking do something

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:07.040
about it rather than selling you bullshit coins. Fuck Joe Biden coins. He's going after the bosses

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:11.760
and that is what they fear most. I mean, there's a reason why some of the richest people on this

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:18.400
planet love a good conspiracy theory. Like, why is Elon Musk the single, you know, greatest vector

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:23.440
of misinformation right now? Like, if you were the richest man on the planet on a good day,

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:29.360
you would want people distracted too. You know, you would want people not looking at systems of

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.680
economic consolidation that allowed you to get as rich as you are. You would want them talking

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.840
about the Jews and the CCP and, you know, Anthony Fauci and the rest of it. It's a distraction machine

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.960
and it serves elites even though they claim to be fighting elites like Rupert Murdoch, right?

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.160
So we just need to understand this. We need to do a little mapping. That's all. Get order.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.960
We need to understand it. And then we need to organize to show the alternative path.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.560
And then we need to win, which we are starting to do, I think.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.640
I think so too. I think so too. And I want to thank you for all of your organizing in

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.040
real world action, right? Because this is, that's how, that's how, that's,

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:16.000
that's the best way we fight this sort of fake world is by doing real work, real work.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.640
That is such a beautiful conclusion to this conversation. Naomi, I'm so thrilled that you

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.040
came on the show. I can't wait. I'm going to get this book, an audio book, I think,

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.200
is going to be for my next month of travel on the road. I can't wait to listen to it.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.840
I hope folks check it out. If you want to pick up a copy,

you can get it at our special bookshop, factuallypod.com, slash books. Naomi,

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.280
is there anywhere else that people can follow you or your work?

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.080
Okay, I guess I'm on. I mean, I can't answer the question now.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.880
You're right. You're right. After an hour of talking about Twitter and stuff like that,

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.040
you know what? How about this? I have a website, NaomiCline.org, and you can, you know,

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:59.760
follow my articles in The Guardian, and you can sign up for my newsletter, which is free.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.800
How's that? That sounds beautiful. And then maybe someone can see you in person

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.920
and talk to you about organizing or something like that. They run into you in British Columbia.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.040
Thank you so much. This was such a pleasure. Thank you so much for being here, Naomi.
