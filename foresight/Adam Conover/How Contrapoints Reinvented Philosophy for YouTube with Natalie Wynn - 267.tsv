0	2440	Hello and welcome to Factually, I'm Adam Conover.
2440	4760	Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.
4760	7720	I am so excited for today's episode.
7720	10440	We have on the show today a guest I have wanted to have
10440	11720	on the show for years.
11720	14480	And frankly, one of the people I most admire
14480	17520	working on the internet or really in all of media today.
17520	20800	I first saw a video from the YouTube channel ContraPoints
20800	23240	five years ago in my trailer while I was working
23240	25800	on one of the last seasons of Adam Ruins Everything.
25800	29120	And this video blew me the fuck away.
29200	32320	It was brilliant, it was fiendishly funny, it was stylish,
32320	34800	and it was unlike anything I had ever seen
34800	36400	on the platform before.
36400	39760	In just 30 minutes, Natalie Wynn, the host of ContraPoints,
39760	41720	explained the right-wing psychologist
41720	43760	and self-help guru, Jordan Peterson,
43760	47040	better than any piece of media I had ever come across.
47040	49880	And from then on, every single one of her videos
49880	51800	became a must-watch for me.
51800	54240	What is so impressive about Natalie's work
54240	56960	is that she doesn't just repackage other people's thoughts
56960	58600	like so many people do on YouTube.
58600	62000	No, she delivers original philosophical insight
62000	64800	and analysis that is genuinely new.
64800	68080	But rather than deliver that in a lecture room or a book,
68080	70800	she puts them into video essays on YouTube
70800	72560	that are watched massively.
72560	76160	Her work has won her nearly 1.8 million YouTube followers
76160	78920	and she has also won a Peabody Award.
78920	81880	Her work is genuinely a new form of media,
81880	85360	serious philosophical work watched by millions
85360	87480	on the biggest platform imaginable.
87480	90200	And I could not be more excited to have her
90200	91560	on the show today.
91560	93360	But before we get into it, I just wanna remind you
93360	94920	that if you wanna support this show

117200	118800	And now let's get to my interview
118800	121520	with the writer, thinker, philosopher and YouTuber,
121520	124360	Natalie Nguyen, also known as ContraPoints.
127040	128800	Natalie, thank you so much for being on the show.
128800	130200	I'm thrilled to have you.
130200	131040	Thank you so much.
131040	132240	I am very happy to be here.
132240	134000	I've wanted to have you on the show for years.
134000	136560	You're probably one of my favorite,
136560	139480	what do I call you, internet public intellectuals?
139480	142760	Like, what do you call yourself?
142760	144360	I guess I worry that public intellectuals
144360	145680	sets me up for failure.
145680	147760	But I'm gonna call myself a YouTuber
147760	152000	because why get more complicated than it needs to be?
152000	156120	But yeah, I make video essays on YouTube.
156120	159040	I've been doing that since 2016 or so.
159040	164040	And cover a lot of topics from politics to sexuality
164440	168720	to psychology, I guess I'll even cover.
168720	171560	So it's pretty broad, I guess,
171560	173520	in terms of what I'll go into.
173520	175200	But yeah, the channel is called ContraPoints.
175200	178640	And I feel like we have something in common in that.
178640	181160	I have said many times on this show,
181160	183160	I intended to go to grad school for philosophy.
183160	184160	I never did.
184160	186280	And it's been a thorn in my side ever since.
186280	189080	I have a shameful bachelor's.
189080	190720	You went for a number of years and left.
190720	193120	And now both here we are on YouTube,
193120	196560	trying to maybe use some of these ideas
196560	197880	in the public sphere,
197880	201240	but you do it on such an incredibly deep level.
201240	204400	Your new video, which has the title Twilight,
204400	207040	that's the entire title.
207040	209280	But in the video, you cover everything
209280	213640	from the nature of desire to sadomasochism,
213640	216200	to radical feminism,
216200	220280	and you end with this incredible insight
220280	223280	about the nature of the masculine and feminine,
223280	225520	and then containing each other.
225520	227760	And watching it, I'm like,
227760	230960	having every single sentence in the video,
230960	232600	it gives me a little mind explosion
232720	234120	of a new insider thought
234120	236160	that I'm processing with everything else.
236160	238080	They're incredibly dense.
238080	240160	It's just such an amazing work
240160	244760	to go all the way from Twilight to that big concept.
244760	247240	Like, how do you even begin to put together
247240	248080	a video like that?
248080	249560	What's the first germ of it?
249560	250720	Well, I think with this video,
250720	253760	I knew I wanted to make a video about sexuality,
253760	255960	but to do that on YouTube,
255960	259280	I was in search of a PG-13 framing device.
259280	260880	And so Twilight kind of became,
260880	262800	I was like, okay, if I want to talk about sexuality,
262800	265120	but I want to do it on YouTube,
265120	267000	the community guidelines will just love
267000	268440	if this video is about Twilight
268440	270360	instead of being about something more explicit.
270360	273920	So, and also, I've been alive long enough
273920	275480	to have sat through, at this point,
275480	278200	20 years of discourse about the Twilight series.
278200	280240	So it's something that I'm very familiar with.
280240	281920	A lot of the complicated conversations
281920	283840	people have about sexuality
283840	288640	have been sort of magnetized to this topic in particular.
288680	290040	So, you know, a lot of the things
290040	291600	that people worry about with Twilight,
291600	295240	the kind of power dynamics and the sort of,
295240	297840	I guess, people worry about misogyny and all this,
297840	300720	I guess, stuff I wanted to go into in the video.
300720	302640	And so for me, Twilight was just like,
302640	304880	I just felt this was like the right case study
304880	308480	that I could attach all these wider issues to.
308480	309960	That's amazing.
309960	311720	And one of the things that's amazing about this video
311720	314320	is it has almost four million views on YouTube.
314320	317080	And, you know, some of your previous works,
317080	319800	you know, say you did a video about Jordan Peterson, right?
319800	321520	That's a wonderful, I think, philosophical,
321520	323200	that's the first thing I ever saw of yours.
323200	326400	And it was really influenced the way that I think about
326400	329600	that guy and that entire movement in, you know,
329600	331680	pseudo-intellectual circles.
331680	333720	But, you know, that's a hot topic for the algorithm, right?
333720	335400	Jordan Peterson does well.
335400	337240	Twilight, if the words Jordan Peterson
337240	339120	are in the title of the video, it'll do well.
339120	341360	This video is about a, you know,
341360	344120	a couple decade old romance series.
344120	346720	And the topic ranges so widely
346720	349200	from the nature of romance fiction all the way to, you know,
349200	351680	the nature of desire and sexuality itself.
351680	354200	And people are watching it in such huge numbers.
354200	355880	What do you, like, attribute that to?
355880	358120	Because, again, it's a really dense,
358120	360240	like truly philosophical work.
360240	362760	Well, I think people are curious about these topics.
362760	364880	And I feel like a lot of times the discourse about them
364880	367000	is of a pretty low quality.
367000	368720	So I feel like this is another thing
368720	371120	that attracted me to this topic is that I felt like,
371120	372480	I feel like that there's stuff
372480	375920	that's not being said about this that I can say.
375960	377760	So, you know, I try to look for something like that
377760	379240	when I'm deciding on a video topic.
379240	380800	If it's something that I feel like a lot of people
380800	383280	are covering really, really well, then I'll, like,
383280	385400	well, I don't know if I can add anything to this,
385400	387840	but with this, I felt like I had something to add.
389120	391800	And yeah, I mean, I guess one reason
391800	396920	I decided to make this video is as a LGBT person,
396920	399040	I feel like, well, I'm a trans woman.
399040	402040	I'm not LGBT and T, but you know what I mean.
403480	405720	I feel like people like me were very frequently
405720	407920	asked these days to, like, provide, like,
407920	410200	to explain ourselves, like, explain your sexuality.
410200	411680	Why are people gay? Why are people trans?
411680	414400	Why are people, and, like, I've spent some time on YouTube
414400	416080	trying to do exactly that.
416080	418800	But I feel like, what I came to realize is, like,
418800	419840	we're trying to understand,
419840	421680	is people are trying to understand why people are gay
421680	422880	or why people are trans.
422880	424440	And no one even really understands
424440	426240	heterosexuality very well yet.
426240	428080	So it's like, why are we trying to do calculus
428080	430160	before we've figured out arithmetic?
430160	433320	So, in a way, I think the, which,
433360	436280	finally, I want to do a video about heterosexuality, right?
436280	437560	It's like, before we start talking,
437560	438960	before we get really complicated with this
438960	441320	and start talking about the sexuality of, you know,
441320	443400	trans people, like, why don't we figure out how, like,
443400	447400	this, the, you know, a Mormon housewife's sexuality works
447400	448720	in the case of Stephanie Meyer, right?
448720	451800	Because I feel like we haven't even kind of cracked that code.
451800	454680	So I guess I felt this was, like,
454680	457960	maybe a better introductory place for people
457960	459280	to start thinking about sexuality
459280	462160	than for, like, demanding that marginalized people
462160	464840	explain themselves to, to people who kind of
464840	467120	don't even have the tools needed to,
467120	468800	to understand it in the first place.
468800	469640	That's so funny.
469640	471680	Well, it's such a funny flip of the request too.
471680	474240	Hey, a queer person, explain yourselves to us.
474240	476040	Well, no, how about me, a queer person,
476040	477880	ask what the hell is up with you people?
477880	478880	Yeah, exactly.
478880	481280	What is up with, your media is really weird.
481280	483160	I mean, because heterosexuality, I mean, sometimes,
483160	484960	you know, people might frame heterosexuality
484960	486640	as like boring or vanilla or whatever.
486640	489320	I mean, heterosexuality is actually extremely complicated,
489320	490160	right?
490600	492560	And you notice this, like, and it's also
492560	494440	something that I think most queer people,
494440	497320	we, you know, we all kind of grew up
497320	500680	being taught how to do heterosexuality in a way, right?
500680	504320	So it's kind of the default that all of us are sort of used to.
504320	506880	And most, I think, a lot of gay people, even,
506880	510240	like, we kind of form our sexuality in response
510240	513920	to heterosexuality, in a sense, or sort of as a modification
513920	516000	of tropes that come from heterosexuality.
516000	518120	So I don't know whether you're taught.
518120	520720	Obviously, this all gets pretty controversial
520720	522320	with in-community stuff that we probably
522320	523320	don't want to get into here.
523320	526240	But, you know, with terms like top and bottom
526240	529880	and or butch and femme, like, these terms are not
529880	531400	the same as heterosexuality, right?
531400	534000	These dynamics are not literally heterosexuality,
534000	536080	but they obviously have some kind of resemblance
536080	538680	to the kind of tropes that we sort of expect
538680	542360	of a, you know, a kind of dominant active man
542360	545840	and sort of submissive, maybe passive woman.
545840	548400	That's kind of the stereotype of heterosexuality.
548400	550800	It certainly comes up a lot in romance fiction,
550800	551640	including Twilight.
551640	554760	So I felt like that was kind of an interesting place
554760	557160	to start with discussing sexuality as just like,
557160	561840	well, let's look at what's considered to be normal
561840	565920	and see how actually complicated and strange
565920	567240	the normal thing is.
567240	569840	Well, I found that fascinating because I am heterosexual,
569840	571480	or at least mostly heterosexual.
571480	572640	We're all a work in progress.
572640	576920	But, you know, heterosexuality, also all of those norms
576920	579000	and tropes were like imposed upon me.
579000	581000	And sometimes, you know, I found myself,
581000	583560	especially in the part of life I am now going like,
583560	585520	wait, what are those things?
585520	587320	What, you know, are those part of me?
587320	589960	Or were those things that were imposed, right?
589960	593720	And so hearing you unpack desire, the nature of desire,
593720	596360	submission, dominance, masculinity, femininity
596360	598640	is incredibly fascinating.
598640	603400	You have this concept that you keep going back to DHSM
603400	604720	in the video over and over again.
604720	607360	Can you tell us a little bit about what you mean by that?
607360	609600	And for folks who haven't seen the video, go watch it.
609600	612240	But, you know, I'd love to give them a little bit of taste
612240	613480	of what the themes are here.
613480	614320	Sure, yeah.
614320	616640	DHSM is an acronym that I made up
616640	619880	for default heterosexual satomasticism.
619880	622560	I was thinking of like BDSM and then I'll just make a,
622560	625760	you know, corresponding acronym that describes what I see
625760	629360	as the kind of assumed satomasticism
629360	631200	of normative heterosexuality.
631200	633720	So, you know, we're all familiar with,
633720	636280	with like heterosexual dating rituals, basically,
636280	638160	where it's kind of expected that a man is going
638160	640440	to take initiative and that a man is going to be more dominant
640440	644040	is going to kind of, you know, lead in the dance of dating,
644040	646280	right, essentially, and also of sex.
646280	651040	And I think that there's a whole complicated series
651040	653520	of power dynamics baked into these assumptions,
653560	655360	where it's assumed that sort of, you know,
655360	657920	you could take things like voyeurism, exhibitionism.
657920	659640	It's assumed that men like to look
659640	661360	and women like to be looked at.
661360	665120	It's assumed that, you know, men pursue
665120	666800	and women are pursued.
666800	669920	All kinds of dynamics like that, you know,
669920	671760	in the video I have a whole list of these,
671760	675160	these binaries that basically are included.
675160	679080	But I guess one of the questions is like, well,
679080	682320	why is this, is this the, is this the project,
682320	684280	basically, of patriarchal conditioning?
684280	687560	Or is there something inherent to human sexuality itself
687560	689280	that involves these binaries?
690200	693560	And so all of that stuff that I try to explore.
693560	695240	And explore through the lens of Twilight,
695240	698280	where all of these things are present,
698280	700640	which is part of the controversy about Twilight, right?
700640	702840	That it's putatively for children,
702840	704360	or at least for young adults.
704360	707960	And yet it has these themes of dominant submission,
708000	713000	sadism, masochism, which feel like really inherently sexual
714280	715680	and confusing to a lot of people,
715680	717160	especially when it's like in the form
717160	718680	of very popular fiction.
718680	720680	And watching it, I literally just watched Twilight
720680	723080	last night, unrelatedly, it was not quite researched,
723080	725080	but it certainly served well as it.
725080	727720	And yeah, I mean, that stuff is in the movie
727720	732480	and in a very like stark, almost blunt way.
732480	734800	Yeah, I think it's interesting how,
734800	739200	because heterosexuality is considered so socially normal,
739200	742000	like you can get away with like a shocking amount
742000	746240	of like weird sex stuff in like young adult media,
746240	748840	as long as you keep it as you keep it hetero, right?
748840	752200	And Twilight definitely pushes that as far as it can.
753280	756360	Obviously, like there was a decade ago,
756360	758920	a controversy erupted around the Twilight fan fiction,
758920	761560	50 Shades of Grey, which is explicitly
761560	764760	a kind of sadomasochistic romance novel
764760	768120	where, I mean, what E.L. James, the author of 50 Shades did,
768120	770320	basically is just pick up on all those themes
770320	772640	that are already present in Twilight
772640	775720	and kind of make explicit what was implicit in Twilight.
775720	779680	So in Twilight, the plot is about a male vampire, Edward,
779680	782440	who falls in love with a human girl, Bella,
782440	787440	and obviously part of the kind of sex appeal of vampires
787920	790600	does have to do with this hierarchical dominance, right?
790600	792120	The vampire is usually old,
792120	794320	is usually there's undertones of violence
794320	796120	with the fangs and blood drinking.
796120	798920	Rich lives in a big castle, right?
798920	801240	Wearing cloaks everywhere, wealthy man.
801240	803400	Yeah, it's inherently associated with like,
803400	805520	there's a few working class vampires, Lost Boys,
805520	808800	but usually it's, we're talking about an aristocrat, right?
808800	809640	Yeah.
809640	812280	Someone who's sort of overwhelmingly powerful
812280	816600	and that seems to be intertwined with why people find
816600	819280	something sort of sexually enticing about vampires.
819280	821600	It is the danger and the power itself.
821600	826080	So the question is like, isn't it kind of disturbing, right?
826080	829000	That like, we have millions of teenage readers
829000	830520	who seem to be so attracted to this
830520	832320	and like, what kind of message is this sending?
832320	834040	Well, before we can even answer that,
834040	837120	you have to unpack why this kind of thing is appealing
837120	839120	to so many people in the first place.
839120	840480	And why do you think it's appealing
840480	841800	to so many people in the first place?
841800	844560	I think for a bunch of different reasons.
844560	847600	I definitely, I'm certainly not dismissive
847600	849320	of the feminist arguments about this,
849320	853880	which are that, you know, if you are a woman or a girl
853880	855160	and you're raised in this society,
855160	858360	where you're kind of conditioned almost to like romanticize
858360	862120	a certain type of dynamic between men and women,
862120	864880	that sort of is the result of a long history
864880	867080	of men having social power over women.
867080	868880	So even in historical romance novels,
868880	871240	like Pride and Prejudice, right?
871240	872920	In Pride and Prejudice, you have Darcy,
872920	875720	this like extremely wealthy man who's,
875720	877120	at first he's kind of an asshole,
877160	879720	and then Elizabeth who needs, you know,
879720	882200	because of the situation of her family, she needs the money,
882200	884000	but she also wants a marriage of love.
884000	887080	And so in Pride and Prejudice, you know,
887080	890040	the appeal of this power dynamic seems to derive in part
890040	892240	from like the economics of the situation,
892240	895480	where it's like as a woman in the early 19th century,
895480	898160	you kind of have your economic fate
898160	900560	is intertwined with who you marry.
900560	903120	So it's not just, it's not,
903120	904680	it's hard to look at something like that
904680	906240	and be like, oh, this is just nature, right?
906680	908320	Women are just naturally attracted to powerful men.
908320	910400	It's like, well, women have always been put
910400	913000	in these situations where they kind of need men
913000	913960	to provide for them.
913960	917160	So yeah, under those conditions, obviously,
917160	919720	most women are going to do the rationally self-interested thing
919720	923840	of pursuing a man who is the only plausible route
923840	925840	that they have to economic stability
925840	927640	and to any kind of power, right?
928640	930680	But I also think that, you know,
930680	934320	the kind of SM, pseudo-masochistic dynamic
934320	936320	has something to it that kind of transcends
936320	940280	just the economic appeal, which is,
940280	943600	I think that there's something about sexuality,
943600	945360	about desire in general,
945360	950360	that kind of likes sort of barriers and overcoming,
950960	952480	you know, overcoming barriers.
952480	957480	So I think one thing that I think about a lot with Twilight
957480	962000	is, you know, when you have this like hunter and prey,
962000	966160	predator-prey dynamic, I think that, you know,
966160	970880	poetry is often described as love, as like a hunt, right?
970880	973320	And there's, you know, it's a motif
973320	975760	that goes like way back into the ancient world.
975760	979480	You know, you can think of myths like Hades and Persephone,
979480	984080	where, you know, you have, I think that when you,
984080	986440	desire often feels like pursuit, right?
986440	991440	And so I think that the metaphor goes kind of,
992000	994600	deeper than just economic imbalance.
994600	997680	I do think that the reason why it's so disproportionately
997680	1002280	seems to be, you know, when people create romantic fantasies,
1002280	1005560	the reason why it's usually a man pursuing a woman,
1005560	1008600	I think that is largely social and economic,
1008600	1011240	but I think that someone pursuing someone,
1011240	1013440	that I think goes deeper, yeah.
1013440	1015960	Right, there's a deeper like pattern
1015960	1019520	in human sexuality or psychology or behavior
1019560	1022160	that needs some kind of disparity,
1022160	1025320	some kind of block in the way.
1025320	1028080	I mean, you talk in the video about how, you know,
1028080	1031480	desire, you can specifically only desire something
1031480	1035200	that you do not have, that once you acquire it,
1035200	1037120	the desire dissipates to some degree,
1037120	1038640	that that's the nature of it.
1038640	1040600	And so you need those impediments.
1040600	1043000	You also say that, I just wrote down this quote
1043000	1046640	from the video, equality like wisdom is not exciting.
1047080	1050680	That if Twilight had been a, there's a power dynamic,
1050680	1052360	oh no, we don't want power dynamics
1052360	1056120	in our real relationships, one might say.
1056120	1057520	But a perfectly equal relationship
1057520	1059680	between Edward and Bella would not be necessarily
1059680	1060760	worth writing a book about,
1060760	1063600	nor might it be sexy to encounter in real life,
1063600	1066120	like that sort of perfect, what do you,
1066120	1067200	could you expand on that?
1067200	1070440	Well, I think that you could certainly make,
1070440	1073480	you know, a egalitarian relationship exciting in fiction,
1073480	1075560	but the way that you do that was be to put
1075640	1077920	other kinds of barriers in the way.
1077920	1079600	So, I mean, I guess you, you look at something
1079600	1081920	like Romeo and Juliet was an obvious example
1081920	1083200	where Romeo and Juliet are, I guess,
1083200	1085320	more or less socially equal, although, you know,
1085320	1088240	as like medieval man and woman, not really,
1088240	1091040	but still like there's not quite the class element
1091040	1093800	that there is in, say, Pride and Prejudice or in Twilight,
1093800	1096480	but as a result of that, other barriers
1096480	1097400	have to be involved, right?
1097400	1101640	Their families are feuding and that as this dangerous,
1101640	1104960	almost like in this case, deadly element to their romance,
1104960	1107480	right, is that they are kind of risking everything
1107480	1108880	for each other.
1108880	1109720	There's different ways, I think,
1109720	1112120	for an artist to accomplish that,
1112120	1115320	but people do seem to find the danger of it exciting, right?
1115320	1117840	And you can, and you can create that through
1117840	1120880	the kind of vampire hierarchy, whereas like one person
1120880	1124680	is sort of overwhelmingly dangerous to the other person,
1124680	1127000	or you can create it through like social circumstances
1127000	1130760	where for whatever reason, this romance is forbidden, right?
1131840	1134600	But speaking more generally about equality,
1134640	1139640	yeah, I do think that, you know, even outside of fantasy,
1140240	1141720	if you look at like role play
1141720	1144000	and the kinds of like scenarios that, you know,
1144000	1146200	if you look at like the fan fiction people, right,
1146200	1148800	or erotica, like it's very common
1148800	1151640	to have situations of power imbalance.
1152520	1155080	So I think that, I don't think it's impossible
1155080	1159640	to make equality sexy, but I think that for a lot of people,
1159640	1162700	a kind of fantasy scenario gets more exciting
1162700	1165260	with the addition of some kind of power play.
1165260	1169020	Right, and the nature of fantasy and sexual fantasy
1169020	1172060	is something that you go into a great deal of detail
1172060	1173260	about, you have a lot of insight into,
1173260	1177620	that fantasy is some way of like licensing ourselves
1177620	1182460	to enjoy that thing while, can you complete my thought?
1182460	1184100	Yeah, I think that human sexuality
1184100	1188740	needs fantasy to function, like I think that we all,
1188740	1190980	well, I don't want to over generalize,
1190980	1192940	but I think that for most people,
1192940	1195740	they don't experience, I don't know, sexuality
1195740	1198380	as this kind of purely animalistic thing, right?
1198380	1201780	It's usually sustained by some kind of fantasy content,
1201780	1204820	you know, whether that's, I mean,
1204820	1207900	I think the best way to encounter a lot of this
1207900	1210500	is just to read a lot of like erotic fan fiction,
1210500	1212900	for example, or to like, I don't know,
1212900	1214700	I mean, you can also like, you know,
1214700	1216420	if you have the stomach for it,
1216420	1219100	you can look at pornography and, you know,
1219100	1221540	I mean, it's the variety of situations
1221540	1224780	that people can caught in their fantasies.
1224780	1227140	I feel like speaks to something in human sexuality
1227140	1231140	that kind of needs something more than just sex, right?
1231140	1233580	Sex, sexuality is more than just sex.
1233580	1236140	Even the bluntest, you know, porn hub video,
1236140	1239020	that's just a video of two people going at it,
1239020	1242060	at least the title will be like, you know,
1242060	1244660	stepmother, blah, blah, blah, there's a scenario,
1244660	1245860	like in the title of the video,
1245860	1248100	at least to just like give you a frame
1248100	1249780	of who these people are to each other,
1249780	1252380	what they might have in common, and, you know,
1252380	1254580	that might draw one person to the video more than another,
1254580	1255900	depending on what you're into.
1255900	1257540	And there has to be a reason for that, right?
1257540	1259780	Like, I think if people,
1259780	1261540	they wouldn't be, they wouldn't be so many stepbrothers
1261540	1264140	in pornography if it wasn't appealing to people
1264140	1264980	for some reason, right?
1264980	1266540	That is generating clicks.
1266540	1267540	Why is that?
1267540	1269460	Well, I mean, we can analyze why.
1269460	1272060	I don't think it's because, I don't think it is
1272060	1274320	because most people have like some kind of secret,
1274320	1276020	unconscious longing for incest.
1276020	1276860	I don't think that's why.
1276860	1279860	I think the taboo is being used in this case,
1279860	1282660	where incest is a taboo, is being used,
1282660	1284980	although it's kind of hedged with the like step thing, right?
1284980	1287140	To, you know, we don't want to go too far,
1287140	1290940	but like this element of like taboo is another factor
1290940	1292620	that kind of increases the excitement
1292620	1294300	by putting an additional barrier, right?
1294300	1296740	Where like social norms are being shattered
1296740	1300060	and desires in some way like pushing through the norm,
1300060	1302980	and that element of like overcoming a barrier
1302980	1304660	always seems to be what's exciting.
1304660	1307500	And I think that goes back to like this idea
1307500	1310780	that desire is lack or that you want what you don't have
1310780	1313340	or want what you're not supposed to be able to have.
1313340	1316460	You know, in a way, it's like the harder you have to,
1316460	1318460	the more obstacles you have to overcome
1318460	1323460	to get what you want in a way the more you want it
1323480	1325740	or the more exciting that it seems, yeah.
1325740	1327220	You also talk about fantasy.
1327220	1329060	This is the most interesting part to me
1329060	1334060	as being a way of, okay, so people say about Twilight a lot.
1334140	1335940	Why is this the fantasy?
1335940	1338540	This is a dangerous situation for, you know,
1338540	1340980	Bella to want someone who might want to kill her
1340980	1342980	or hurt her and is barely holding back.
1342980	1344180	Isn't that frightening?
1345180	1347300	But you talk about fantasy as being a way
1347300	1352300	of almost creating a safe place for the female character
1352460	1354820	to enjoy a certain type of desire
1354820	1356380	that would otherwise be dangerous.
1356380	1358740	I might be mutilating the point.
1358740	1360500	Could you, you know what I'm talking about?
1360500	1362740	Yeah, well, I think that, you know,
1362740	1365460	look at the kinds of media that people consume all the time.
1365460	1369020	Like the popularity of movies about the apocalypse
1369020	1373100	or about, you know, all kinds of horrible things happening.
1373100	1375460	People like to experience things in fantasy,
1375460	1376700	in art, in general,
1376700	1379660	that obviously we don't want to experience in reality.
1379660	1381860	Yeah, we crave the apocalypse
1381860	1383580	even though we don't want to live within it.
1383580	1386460	Most of us do not want the apocalypse to happen,
1386460	1387700	but there's, you know,
1387700	1389700	there's something that just is endlessly fascinating
1389700	1391100	to people about watching a movie
1391100	1392740	where like New York City is destroyed.
1392740	1393660	We just, we're obsessed
1393660	1395860	because we just want to see it again and again.
1395860	1397620	And that's not, I don't think
1397620	1400260	because we actually want New York City to be destroyed, right?
1400260	1402460	It's because there's, I don't know,
1402460	1404220	there's some, there's some part of it
1404220	1406460	that's part of us that's sort of fascinated
1406460	1409500	with at least the idea of destruction, right?
1409500	1410340	Yeah.
1410340	1412540	And or like the fantasy of it, even though we, you know,
1412540	1416580	and I think for mentally stable people,
1416580	1419660	those two things are securely separated.
1420580	1422740	You know, I do think that there's like a validity
1422740	1424300	to the objection that, you know,
1424300	1426580	people who worry about media like Twilight
1426580	1430780	being so popular or normal among teenagers, you know,
1430780	1434700	do teenagers have the media skills is the question, right?
1434700	1436460	To understand, okay, like this is not
1436460	1438540	depicting an actual relationship, right?
1438540	1440580	Like this is not depicting an ideal.
1440580	1443140	Like we don't, we don't want a real relationship
1443140	1445620	with a vampire that that's not, that's, you know,
1445620	1447620	this type of relationship is disastrous.
1447620	1449100	If you're actually in a relationship
1449140	1451420	with someone who wants to, you know, drink your blood
1451420	1453500	or who wants to kill you or whatever, that's, you know,
1453500	1456100	that's a catastrophe if it actually happens.
1456100	1460220	But in fantasy, again, these things kind of become exciting
1460220	1462180	and the danger as to the excitement.
1463100	1466540	But, and I think that most readers of these things know that,
1466540	1467380	right?
1467380	1470300	I think most readers of dark romance novels are aware
1470300	1472700	that what they're not, they're not consuming content
1472700	1474500	that's like, ooh, this is a blueprint
1474500	1475700	for how to live your life.
1475700	1477460	Like most people know that when,
1477460	1480060	when you read escapist fantasy, you're not,
1480060	1481700	you don't actually want that to happen.
1481700	1484100	But of course, you know, you can't always point to
1484100	1487860	some people who don't have, who, who aren't so good
1487860	1489820	at making those distinctions between fantasy
1489820	1491660	and what they really want.
1491660	1495540	But I do think that it's unfair to malign the fantasy itself
1495540	1500540	because some people are sort of don't have like a good grip
1500540	1502580	on the difference between fantasy and reality.
1502580	1505140	Yeah, we all engage in fantasy.
1505140	1507180	And yet, because it's a human thing to do.
1507180	1511700	And yet there's this constant push to criticize the fantasies
1511700	1513980	that other people have as being harmful
1513980	1515580	while engaging in our own.
1515580	1516540	Yeah, absolutely.
1516540	1519100	And I mean, that's one reason why you have, you know,
1519100	1521420	so slogans like, don't yuck my yum
1521420	1524180	or like the discourse about kink shaming.
1524180	1525780	I mean, obviously these that, you know,
1525780	1527540	that those kinds of slogans are relative
1527540	1530020	to a particular context where, you know,
1530020	1532380	you've, you've agreed on in advance that, okay,
1532380	1534340	this is a space where we're, where we're going
1534340	1535740	to openly discuss sexuality.
1535740	1539020	And, and so like within certain reasonable limits,
1539020	1542300	I think we, you know, you say like, we appreciate
1542300	1546060	that people have like a very diverse range of, you know,
1546060	1548060	turn-ons basically, right?
1548060	1550900	And so what other, what someone else might be into
1550900	1552620	might seem like completely disgusting to you,
1552620	1555340	but like, yeah, that's just, that's just how it is.
1555340	1558140	Like, I don't know, the humans are very diverse.
1558980	1561580	And human sexuality is like,
1561580	1563540	is that kind of amazingly diverse in a way?
1563540	1566900	Because the sense, obviously this is something that does
1566900	1569900	at some point have some kind of biological evolutionary
1569900	1573740	history, but the psychology of it has, is like,
1573740	1575860	well, is a significantly more complicated
1575860	1577340	than biological function.
1577340	1581740	Yeah, and a big theme in the video is
1581740	1585860	how our sexuality is more flexible or more, you know,
1585860	1588740	less determined biologically than a lot of people think.
1588740	1589900	You're pushing back against the idea
1589900	1592660	of default heterosexual sadomasochism.
1592780	1596260	A point that really spoke to me was,
1596260	1600060	you noted how a lot of men who are, you know,
1600060	1602060	socialized to be dominant or to, you know,
1602060	1604980	to be the Edward in the situation, right?
1604980	1608460	And to pursue and to be the desirer
1608460	1611700	have like a latent wish to be desired.
1611700	1614140	And I'll just say I related to this.
1614140	1617220	I was like, you know, a little ping went off in my head.
1617220	1619220	Ah, yes, I have felt that way
1619220	1620780	and never quite had language for it,
1620780	1622300	which I think is a wonderful thing
1622300	1623820	that media like yours can do.
1623820	1626420	Can you talk a little bit more about that idea
1626420	1628140	and where that came from?
1628140	1629260	Yeah, this is something I've heard
1629260	1630740	from a lot of individual men.
1630740	1633580	I mean, I also think that when I'm doing research
1633580	1635340	on videos like this, I will kind of browse
1635340	1638380	across social media in search of relevant discussions.
1638380	1640180	And I remember one time, I think it was like
1640180	1643220	the ask men subreddit, someone asked something
1643220	1645820	along the lines of, you know, what is one thing
1645820	1648180	that you want from relationships with women
1648180	1650620	that you feel like you don't often get?
1650620	1652700	And I think the most upvoted response to that question
1652700	1656220	was I want to feel like I am desired.
1657220	1660540	So I think that, you know, I think that both men
1660540	1664260	and women are in a way not served well
1664260	1666700	by being forced to conform to a default
1666700	1669580	heterosexual sadomasochism where it's only the man
1669580	1672060	who's supposed to desire and the woman only
1672060	1673820	is supposed to want to be desired.
1673820	1675900	I think that puts people in boxes
1675900	1678780	where there's certain desires that don't get acknowledged
1678780	1679620	or met.
1679620	1682540	And as you say, often people don't have the words for it.
1682540	1686140	So I think that a woman who kind of wants to that more
1686140	1691140	like, quote unquote, virile, like pursuing a desiring rule,
1692660	1694260	you know, we'll feel like she, there's something sort
1694260	1696340	of masculine about inherent to that
1696340	1699100	or something even sort of shamefully unfeminine about it.
1699100	1703260	And likewise, I think that men are put in this situation
1703260	1705940	where they, because they need to be the dominant
1705940	1709620	active pursuers, there's part of them
1709620	1712220	that maybe wants to be, you know, that you,
1712220	1713500	you want to be pursued, right?
1713500	1715460	You want to also feel that, you know,
1715460	1717420	someone you're attracted to is attracted to you
1717420	1719900	and will is kind of active in that.
1719900	1721900	And it's not just like a passive participant
1721900	1723540	for you to do things too, right?
1723540	1727140	Like I think that, but I think that, you know,
1728260	1729980	there's often some, there's often a kind of shame
1729980	1732100	that comes with that where I think it, you know,
1732100	1735740	it's sort of, it feels unmanly maybe.
1735740	1738500	I think even to kind of want to be wanted.
1738500	1740660	But there are times that, you know,
1740660	1742340	I think you have some examples of this.
1742340	1745340	If you look through the behaviors of actual men
1745340	1748820	in real life, you know, they will betray that desire
1748820	1750660	or there's certain features of masculine,
1750660	1753060	well, I mean, you saw it for yourself on a Reddit page.
1753060	1756180	These things are real and an acknowledgement
1756180	1759340	of them can lead to a more functional sexuality.
1759340	1761620	I mean, you, you had a, what's the word?
1761620	1763540	It's not variability, something like that.
1763580	1768460	Flexibility that you say, maybe rather than equality,
1768460	1770380	we can strive for, what is the word you use?
1770380	1771220	Versatility.
1771220	1772620	Versatility, thank you.
1772620	1773900	Just talk about that a little bit.
1773900	1776420	Well, I guess, I mean, the word comes from,
1776420	1780340	from gay culture where, you know,
1780340	1782540	people will use terms like top and bottom
1782540	1785220	or, you know, Dom and sub.
1785220	1787580	And then the word verse means that you are someone
1787580	1790660	who's interested in, or who likes,
1790700	1792740	basically occupying either role.
1793740	1797020	So verse, just sort of for versatile.
1797020	1800940	But I think like most straight people do not use terms
1800940	1802540	like top and bottom and, you know,
1802540	1804180	there's a question of whether straight people should use them
1804180	1806620	because it's something that comes from gay culture.
1806620	1808460	But I do think that most people,
1808460	1811180	gay or straight or bi or whatever you are,
1811180	1813260	like would benefit from this concept,
1813260	1815780	from being a little bit more open to versatility
1815780	1818900	and relationships and in sexuality.
1818900	1822780	I think that, I think a lot of people have like, you know,
1822780	1826260	by putting themselves in one box or the other,
1826260	1830540	kind of are closing off some part of their own desire.
1830540	1833380	And it's something that you kind of discover
1833380	1835180	by opening yourself up to it.
1836740	1839580	Whereas I think most people tend to, you know,
1839580	1841460	all of us are kind of on some level,
1841460	1843720	the products of the social conditioning.
1843720	1848060	And so there's a implicit value, I think,
1848060	1850620	placed on a man being active or a woman being passive
1850620	1853300	or a man being the one who desires,
1853300	1855660	a woman who's sort of being desirable.
1855660	1859180	And I think that for most people,
1859180	1862620	if you want to get outside of those boxes,
1862620	1865460	it involves navigating a certain level of shame
1865460	1869380	and overcome and also like conceptually the confusion
1869380	1870940	that comes with what I'm calling default,
1870940	1872700	heterosexual masculinity, right?
1872700	1876060	Where I think so many, this idea is like so deep
1876060	1879020	that a lot of people think that what it is to be masculine
1879020	1883660	or to be male even is to be active and to be, right?
1883660	1888420	It's often like assumed to map on to anatomy in some way,
1888420	1889260	right?
1889260	1891540	That it's just assumed that like a male sexual role is active
1891540	1893980	and a female sexual role is passive.
1893980	1894820	But I don't think that's,
1894820	1897100	I don't think that's psychologically the case.
1897100	1900460	And I think that it comes across in things like,
1900460	1902900	well, even if you just like look at like,
1902900	1905820	manosphere like incel culture, for example,
1905820	1909580	a lot of these, you know, so if you read incel forms,
1909580	1911740	they get really upset when someone suggests
1911740	1913180	like just hire a sex worker.
1913180	1914220	Well, they don't want to do that.
1914220	1915420	They don't want to hire a sex worker.
1915420	1916260	Why?
1916260	1917900	Because it's not really just about sex for them.
1917900	1919700	They haven't really analyzed this maybe,
1919700	1922660	but they want a woman to want them, right?
1922660	1923980	They don't want to pay for it, right?
1923980	1926140	They don't want this transaction because,
1926140	1928460	because, you know, and maybe they feel like
1928460	1930100	they can't say that and they don't know how to say it,
1930100	1932500	but it's like, they want to feel desirable
1932500	1935020	and that's something that they're sort of
1935020	1936780	almost confused about, it seems.
1936780	1938980	And likewise with, you know, romance novels,
1938980	1942780	a very feminine genre, you know, a lot of romance novels
1942780	1946620	are written with a very strong male perspective in them.
1946620	1949220	And one thing that I kind of speculate about
1949220	1951340	is I do think that a lot of women read romance novels
1951340	1953860	and identify with the man, right?
1953860	1955740	So, I mean, for example, and you know,
1955740	1957900	Twilight, Stephanie Meyer has rewritten
1957900	1960540	in this 2020 book, Midnight Sun,
1960540	1962020	which is just the Twilight story,
1962020	1964060	but told from Edward's perspective.
1965300	1967300	It's common in mainstream romance novels,
1967300	1970100	even for the male's perspective to be included,
1970100	1973460	I think because women have the kind of versatility,
1973460	1976940	a lot of female readers have like the versatility of that,
1976940	1977780	right?
1977780	1978620	They like being able to identify
1978620	1980300	with either side of this dynamic.
1980300	1983980	Yeah, and I mean, that's in Twilight a little bit itself
1983980	1986900	that, you know, Edward has some,
1986900	1987860	I think you would call,
1988020	1989780	typically feminine qualities.
1989780	1991580	That's what, you know, a lot of teenage boys
1991580	1993700	were pissed about when the book came out that like,
1993700	1996340	oh, he's kind of like a feminized vampire in some way.
1996340	1998460	There's parts where Bella becomes a vampire,
1998460	2001420	becomes stronger than him and maybe dominates him
2001420	2003980	a little bit, like it's almost modeling
2003980	2007620	a healthy, versatile like switch that they're able to do.
2007620	2009140	Is that the case?
2009140	2011620	Well, I think that if by the end of the series, right,
2011620	2014180	that the dynamic between them does kind of equalize,
2014180	2016220	which I do think is another thing that people do tend
2016220	2018620	to neglect when they discuss this story,
2018620	2021740	is that it starts out with this massive power imbalance.
2021740	2024660	But by the end of the series,
2024660	2026620	Bella has also become a vampire
2026620	2029380	and she's kind of like risen to Edward's level
2029380	2031140	and their dynamic is much more equal.
2031140	2034420	And that's pretty explicitly something that's explored
2034420	2036980	and breaking down at the last of those novels.
2036980	2038460	Yeah, and even in the first film,
2038460	2040380	which is the only one that I've seen, you know,
2040380	2043420	yes, there's a dominant and submissive relationship
2043420	2046220	to some degree, but also, you know,
2046220	2049580	Edward is like almost driven mad by his desire.
2049580	2052380	He can't stay away and I'm watching it going like,
2052380	2054140	Bella doesn't feel like unpowerful.
2054140	2056060	She feels like she has, you know,
2056060	2059220	there is a power in the being chased, right?
2059220	2061780	In being desired, like every single time
2061780	2063460	one of these ideas arises,
2063460	2066340	the opposite is buried just under the surface,
2066340	2069660	like ready to come out and flip over in some way.
2069660	2071220	And that sort of leads me to the end of the video.
2071220	2073140	I think one of the most powerful ideas
2073180	2074660	that when you got to this point, again,
2074660	2077180	I was like, how did we get here in a video about Twilight?
2077180	2079980	The idea that, you know, we do not have a,
2079980	2082300	I'm gonna mangle again what you said,
2082300	2084940	but, you know, we do not have a gender binary,
2084940	2086180	we have a gender yin yang,
2086180	2089500	where the masculine and feminine are counterparts
2089500	2090860	and contain each other
2090860	2094700	and are constantly undermining or replacing each other
2094700	2097580	and that containing each other and nested, nested levels.
2097580	2099460	How did you come to that idea?
2099460	2102300	Was that through the examination of Twilight?
2102300	2105020	Or was that an idea that you had had before
2105020	2107380	that you expressed via Twilight?
2107380	2110620	Well, I like the idea that this was some like deep truth
2110620	2112780	that I discovered by reading Twilight.
2112780	2117540	In reality, no, I don't think that was exactly how it happened.
2117540	2120460	But yeah, I was actually thinking about the concept
2120460	2125460	of yin yang and I like this kind of as a more,
2127580	2129820	what I think is a deeper way of thinking about
2129820	2131940	what people often think of as a binary.
2131940	2134140	So a binary is just one and zero,
2134140	2138420	but oftentimes binaries like masculine and feminine,
2138420	2141740	that they sort of are mutually constitutive, right?
2141740	2144420	Where like part of what it means to be,
2144420	2147100	you can't really understand what we mean by masculinity
2147100	2150220	unless it's complimented by this concept of femininity.
2151180	2154180	And I think that when you appreciate that,
2154180	2158500	you also kind of see the transformative capacity
2158500	2160860	that exists in this where, you know,
2160900	2162820	there is something feminine about the masculine
2162820	2164820	and there's something masculine about the feminine.
2164820	2168220	And one person is not just masculine or feminine.
2168220	2171820	I think that, you know, we all have these sides to ourself
2171820	2174300	and over time these can change
2174300	2175900	and one or the other can be more dominant
2175900	2177340	at different times.
2177340	2179540	At least that's how I think about,
2179540	2181900	that's how I think about masculinity and femininity,
2181900	2184700	not as like, oh, either you're masculine or you're feminine
2184700	2186620	and that's like an essential thing about yourself.
2186620	2190340	Like, no, I think we each contain the whole dynamic
2190340	2191780	in a way.
2191780	2195620	So I think that that is something that,
2195620	2198740	I mean, you don't have to explore this through Twilight,
2198740	2199580	but I think that it's something
2199580	2202140	that Twilight does ultimately explore.
2202140	2204660	And not just Twilight, I mean, often romance novels,
2204660	2206580	you know, they get a lot of criticism
2206580	2208820	for being sort of, you know, masochistic,
2208820	2211940	that is for having disempowered female protagonists,
2211940	2213380	which a lot of them do,
2213380	2215380	but a lot of those disempowered female protagonists
2215380	2217980	also kind of end the novel powerful.
2218780	2221500	And so I think in a way, the inequality,
2222420	2223420	you know, I mean, it's complicated,
2223420	2224460	where you could argue that the inequality
2224460	2227900	is being romanticized and often it is,
2227900	2229860	but also a lot of times the inequality
2229860	2233460	is there as an obstacle to be overcome, right?
2233460	2237140	The inequality is the driver of a conflict
2237140	2239660	where the end of the fantasy,
2239660	2241380	like the consummation of the fantasy
2241380	2244140	is in a way overcoming the inequality
2244140	2247220	and, you know, achieving an equal relationship.
2247220	2249500	Right, the separation ending,
2249500	2252900	the separation of desire ending and the becoming one,
2252900	2254860	which brings us back to the yin-yang.
2254860	2259660	And it's also a, I see how this works in sex, right?
2259660	2262940	That if you are beginning in a masculine way,
2262940	2265340	but there's the seeds of femininity within, right?
2265340	2268740	And when that comes out, that is a sexy reversal, right?
2270180	2272420	It makes me think a little bit in,
2272420	2274740	this is a very strange comparison,
2274740	2276020	but in comedy writing,
2276020	2279780	something that we do a lot is hiring and lowering.
2279780	2281380	You know, you want to see the low become high
2281380	2282220	and the high become low.
2282220	2283940	The Lord becomes the peasant,
2283940	2286300	the dog starts walking around and giving orders, you know,
2286300	2288980	like the dog and family guy or whatever, right?
2288980	2290420	It's fun to see the flip
2290420	2292660	and you wanna see it happen over and over, right?
2292660	2293980	You wanna see in trading places,
2293980	2296580	you wanna see them go up and down and down and up.
2296580	2300260	It's the transition between the two that is enjoyable.
2300260	2304380	It's not like the static nature of staying in one place,
2304380	2308660	which I don't know, that's life, right?
2308660	2310340	That's what is fulfilling,
2310340	2312660	is to experience that going back and forth.
2312660	2314300	I think there's so many odd connections
2314300	2316220	between comedy and sexuality.
2316220	2318700	There's, I like what you're saying about like high and low,
2318700	2321020	sort of, you know, becoming each other.
2321020	2323140	There's also the tension and release theme
2323140	2325740	that I think I talk about a bit in the Twilight video.
2325740	2327580	And obviously this is the thing that comics
2327580	2328420	will talk about, right?
2328420	2329380	You know, building tension,
2329380	2331900	a joke often starts by building tension
2331900	2334220	and then a punchline will be a release of that tension
2334220	2335620	and the audience laughs.
2335620	2338820	I mean, I think sexuality works that way too.
2338820	2342380	The reason our romance novel usually has a kind of,
2342380	2343460	I mean, there's a reason people like
2343460	2345260	the historical romance novel, right?
2345260	2347740	And part of it has to do with tension.
2347740	2350500	There's more tension in historical romance,
2350500	2353180	oftentimes because of the barriers
2353180	2354960	that that setting involves, right?
2354960	2356900	Everyone's wearing so many clothes.
2356900	2358460	I mean, to be very literal about it,
2358460	2360660	but also there's all, there's like social,
2360660	2363300	there's social, it's not just the bodice,
2363380	2364900	it's the social bodice, right?
2364900	2369060	There's rules about who can have a romantic relationship
2369060	2372300	with whom and those rules create a kind of,
2372300	2374380	they add to the tension between characters.
2374380	2376140	As the sort of stakes are higher,
2376140	2377940	there's more that's key,
2377940	2379860	the situation is high, strong, right?
2379860	2382860	It's tense and that I think people find sexy,
2382860	2386140	obviously hoping that eventually the tension is released,
2386140	2389620	but in a way that it just kind of similar to a joke.
2389620	2392420	Yeah, I mean, I love how comedy is similar
2392460	2393980	to other genres, I have to think about comedy
2393980	2396380	is similar to horror in a lot of ways.
2396380	2398740	I've never considered how it's similar to romance,
2398740	2403740	but it really is, that's so funny and surprising to me.
2405060	2408100	Folks, did you know that learning actually makes a sound?
2408100	2410260	It's true, listen to this.
2410260	2413700	That is the sound of you learning a new language with Babbel.
2413700	2415620	Learning a new language can be one of the toughest,
2415620	2417860	yet most rewarding challenges out there.
2417860	2419640	So if you are ready to dive in,
2419680	2421480	make sure you are using the right tools
2421480	2422800	to get the job done.
2422800	2425640	See, Babbel isn't just a game masquerading
2425640	2428280	as a learning app, it is crafted by real people
2428280	2430080	for real conversations.
2430080	2431880	With Babbel, you get tips and tools
2431880	2434560	that are approachable and rooted in real life situations,
2434560	2436920	delivered through conversation-based teaching.
2436920	2438320	This means that you'll be ready to put
2438320	2441760	what you have learned into practice in the real world.
2441760	2442600	And let me tell you something,
2442600	2445000	the real world is where you want to put the language
2445000	2447120	you learned through Babbel into use.
2447120	2448280	I live in Los Angeles,
2448280	2450880	a huge number of my fellow Angelenos speak Spanish,
2450880	2453640	and that means because I am studying Spanish with Babbel,
2453640	2456040	I can actually improve my daily life
2456040	2457880	and the communication with people around me.
2457880	2461360	It has really enriched my experience of the city I live in
2461360	2463640	because now words that used to mean nothing to me
2463640	2465320	mean something, I can speak to people,
2465320	2467480	I wasn't able to before, even just a little bit,
2467480	2469080	it really makes a big difference.
2469080	2469920	But you know what?
2469920	2471560	You don't have to take my word for it.
2471560	2473800	Studies from Yale, Michigan State University,
2473800	2476280	and others show that Babbel is effective.
2476280	2479440	One study even found that using Babbel for 15 hours
2479440	2481880	is equivalent to a full semester of college.
2481880	2484440	And look, I can't promise that it'll be easy,
2484440	2486080	but you'll be glad you did it.
2486080	2486920	And guess what?
2486920	2489740	Here's a special limited time deal for faculty listeners.
2489740	2492160	Right now you can get up to 60% off

2498040	2501360	get up to 60% off at babbel.com slash factually,
2501360	2505480	that's spelled B-A-B-B-E-L.com slash factually,
2505560	2507760	rules and restrictions may apply.
2507760	2509800	You also come to this point though,
2509800	2513320	about human sexuality, I think it's so beautiful.
2513320	2518320	You're talking about, again, SNM and fantasy and desire,
2519040	2521040	but you come to this point about masculine and feminine
2521040	2522160	containing each other.
2522160	2524520	And one of the things I love that you say is,
2524520	2528640	someone who is a masculine acting man or a trans person
2528640	2532560	is not appropriating someone else's sexuality.
2532560	2534680	Masculinity and femininity are like,
2534720	2536080	we all have them as humans.
2536080	2538680	We are all, and they're all our, you don't say birthright,
2538680	2541720	but they're all something that we are entitled to
2541720	2543360	by virtue of our humanity.
2543360	2545000	And that's such a, I don't know,
2545000	2547720	that's such a powerful point that spirals off
2547720	2550480	in so many other directions, philosophical, political,
2550480	2552680	and to get there from this place
2552680	2554360	where you're talking about SNM and Twilight
2554360	2555760	is fascinating to me.
2555760	2557200	Yeah, I think that, I mean,
2557200	2559280	people will often say, oh, genders differ from race,
2559280	2562960	but then without really specifying what that difference is.
2563080	2565680	I mean, I think one of them has to do with the fact that,
2565680	2568760	you know, gender exists in some form
2568760	2572120	in pretty much every human society that I'm aware of.
2572120	2574480	I guess, you know, I think gender does,
2574480	2575680	in some ancestral way, of course,
2575680	2580680	derive from the kind of generally dimorphic reproductive roles,
2580840	2583440	but obviously there's a lot more to gender than that.
2583440	2585760	And in a lot of ways, gender has become,
2585760	2588560	and for a long time, you know, quite unhinged,
2588560	2591600	I think, from directly being about reproduction.
2592600	2597600	But I think that, you know, unlike race or ethnicity,
2597640	2600400	like within every human family, there is a man and a woman.
2600400	2602080	Well, actually, not every human family, right?
2602080	2603880	We can...
2603880	2605160	Of course.
2605160	2608000	But again, I think that the origin of,
2608000	2610080	most people have a mother and a father,
2610080	2611920	and I think that's the sort of origin of a lot of ideas
2611920	2614960	about masculinity and femininity.
2614960	2618280	And I think that no one person is like,
2618280	2621080	you know, just the result of,
2621120	2622440	I mean, I guess, I don't know,
2622440	2624480	I guess there's probably some like monk somewhere
2624480	2628840	who has never met a woman, but I don't know.
2628840	2631280	I do feel that most people contain
2631280	2633920	some masculine and feminine element.
2634880	2637880	And I think that to me,
2637880	2641440	I see some level of androgyny as being,
2641440	2642600	I mean, I guess I'm kind of getting this
2642600	2643640	from Virginia Woolf, right?
2643640	2646960	Who says like, oh, a great writer is always androgynous,
2646960	2647800	right?
2647800	2649320	And the idea seeming to be that like,
2649360	2651560	to kind of fully perfect yourself as an artist,
2651560	2654560	you need to be in touch with both the masculine
2654560	2657080	and the feminine within yourself.
2657080	2659360	And, you know, if things get too unbalanced,
2660880	2661840	it leads to problems.
2661840	2666360	So I think that that applies not just to art,
2666360	2667800	but also kind of to sexuality,
2667800	2670640	where I guess I've tried it at times
2670640	2672560	to force myself into one box or another.
2672560	2675760	I've tried to be, you know,
2675760	2677200	to make myself more masculine
2677240	2680440	or try to conform to like a very strict idea of femininity.
2680440	2682000	And neither of those has ever worked for me.
2682000	2684040	So maybe this is just me, you know,
2684040	2687360	in a way, philosophy is autobiography.
2687360	2688880	In a way, maybe this is me just working
2688880	2689840	for my own personal thing
2689840	2692240	and then making sweeping generalizations about human nature.
2692240	2693400	Well, lots of people do that.
2693400	2695200	So I guess, you know, guilty.
2695200	2697800	But I think it's, you know,
2697800	2699080	there's sweeping generalizations
2699080	2700960	that other people seem to relate to.
2700960	2702480	So I think it's probably not just me
2702480	2705800	that finds that only being strictly masculine
2705800	2707560	or strictly feminine doesn't really,
2707560	2710000	hasn't really worked out well for me.
2710000	2711800	And I think it probably doesn't work out well
2711800	2713040	for a lot of people.
2713040	2715240	Yeah, I've often felt that in my own life,
2715240	2717600	that that's a box that I was placed in
2717600	2721840	and I have a constant sort of desire to undermine it
2721840	2724440	or to find, you know, more richness in it
2724440	2726160	or to find what I'm missing.
2726160	2728720	And I think that's probably part of why this
2728720	2731360	was a popular video is because it expresses that.
2731360	2733720	You said philosophy, I want to talk more
2733760	2736280	about how you think about this video
2736280	2737320	as a work of philosophy.
2737320	2739040	I mean, at one point, I believe there's a graphic
2739040	2741680	on the screen that says, or maybe you say this out loud,
2741680	2743000	that you made this video
2743000	2744960	instead of writing a PhD dissertation.
2744960	2748280	And at that moment, I realized, wait, this, yeah,
2748280	2750720	that is this dense of a philosophical work.
2750720	2752800	There is that many citation of other thinkers.
2752800	2755200	You're doing that much original thinking.
2755200	2757080	I mean, there's a huge number of videos
2757080	2759400	that are, you know, philosophy videos on YouTube
2759400	2760600	that are just summarizing.
2760600	2762520	And that's wonderful for them to summarize.
2762520	2764360	That's essentially what I feel I do as a comic.
2764360	2767960	I read a bunch of ideas and I summarize them for you
2767960	2769600	in a way that is funny and intelligible.
2769600	2770600	I make it go down easy.
2770600	2773120	And hopefully I get a couple of my own ideas in there too,
2773120	2775640	because I'm a smart person and I like to think I am.
2775640	2777960	And I have my own thoughts about the world.
2777960	2781560	But I mean, at the end of this video,
2781560	2784600	I was like, put this in a fucking library somewhere
2784600	2787120	because people need to like keep watching it
2787120	2788960	and understanding exactly what point you're making
2788960	2791240	and put it into dialogue with other philosophers
2791240	2793440	or psychologists or thinkers.
2793440	2796320	I mean, how do you think about the work in that way?
2796320	2798600	Well, I think unlike, I mean, this video,
2798600	2801160	more than my other videos was like,
2801160	2802960	I did so much research for this.
2802960	2805800	I think I read at least 100 books for this.
2805800	2807760	And then it also like a lot of articles and things.
2807760	2809400	And so I tried to get like very familiar
2809400	2811360	with like a wide range of thinking
2811360	2813520	about the topics that I wanted to cover
2813520	2817640	and use that to build what's basically a three hour argument
2817640	2819320	of what I wanted to say.
2819320	2821360	So that I think is more academic
2821360	2822880	than most of the stuff I do on YouTube
2822880	2824960	in the sense that the citations are very wide
2824960	2827400	and there's a lot of them.
2827400	2830280	But also, yeah, I am trying to make an argument
2830280	2832240	that I think is my own argument.
2832240	2834280	And then the citations are just sort of ways
2834280	2837960	of like bringing in other people's ideas.
2837960	2839400	You know, it's always tricky with a video essay.
2839400	2842400	You wanna balance like the kind of academic side
2842400	2843920	with the entertainment side.
2843920	2845640	You can't just sit in front of a camera
2845640	2848600	and like read your, you know, master's thesis or whatever.
2848600	2850800	Because I think people will find that boring.
2850800	2855120	But, you know, the hope anyway with this video
2855120	2857640	was that I was gonna be able to balance
2857640	2860920	what are my sincere ideas in my academic reading?
2860920	2862680	I'm hoping that I presented this in a way
2862680	2866560	that was not just kind of for an academic audience
2866560	2868440	but would be for a popular audience.
2868440	2870920	And people have watched the videos, I guess,
2870920	2872960	on some level that has succeeded.
2872960	2876680	I know you left the world of academia years ago
2876680	2878760	after spending some time there.
2878760	2880800	But it really struck me with this video
2880800	2884320	that you are doing work that one would strive to do
2884320	2885320	in an academic setting.
2885320	2887600	I have to imagine that there are people, you know,
2887600	2890320	in grad school or philosophy professors themselves
2890320	2894280	who are thinking, my God, I wish my ideas, you know,
2894280	2898920	we're able to get 3.7 million views on YouTube.
2898920	2903920	Are you, is that a world that you still want to interact with
2904160	2906160	or that you hope this video interacts with?
2906160	2908520	Have you had outreach from, you know,
2908520	2911480	people who are working on similar ideas and issues
2911480	2913360	in the world of the Academy?
2913360	2914400	I have, yeah.
2914400	2918480	And I, it's been long enough now that I do sometimes miss
2918480	2921200	the academic context.
2921200	2923480	I mean, I think I kind of overdosed on it a bit
2923480	2924320	when I was in my 20s.
2924320	2928240	Like, I, you know, getting a, I got half of a philosophy,
2928240	2930760	PhD, basically, and ended up quitting with a master's
2930760	2932640	before writing a dissertation.
2932640	2936880	But I think that I kind of coasted for a few years
2936880	2937720	afterwards.
2937720	2939800	I was like, well, I've basically spent most of my 20s
2939800	2940960	with my face in a book.
2940960	2945080	So now, you know, I want to like say things with that
2945080	2946760	to an actual audience.
2946760	2949840	And I felt that I found the audience on YouTube.
2949840	2952400	But I think a few years ago, I started worrying.
2952400	2955520	I was like, it's been years now since I was in,
2955520	2958200	since I was taking classes or going to seminars,
2958200	2959680	getting feedback from professors.
2959680	2960720	I sort of started to worry.
2960720	2961880	I was like, I'm going to get some,
2961880	2965520	I'm going to start getting sloppy and boring.
2965520	2968720	In a sense, if I don't, well, not boring,
2968720	2971000	but I guess I worried that I was going to get a little too
2971000	2974440	detached from that like research foundation.
2974440	2977920	So I, with this project, I really wanted to make myself
2977920	2980720	like go back to school in a way.
2980720	2984160	And so I read a lot of like pretty dense texts
2984160	2989160	from psychoanalysis to feminist theory to, you know,
2990000	2995000	kind of a wide source of commentary on sexuality
2995120	2997640	or on gender.
2997640	3002640	So I tried to kind of bolster the substance of this video
3003640	3006640	by using academic texts again.
3006640	3010440	And that's such a, it's such a project to do that.
3010440	3013080	Like as somebody who builds arguments myself
3013080	3016960	and my own work done so on TV, I do so on YouTube now.
3017000	3019920	It's a big lift for me to do 20 minutes, right?
3019920	3021800	To make a 20 minute argument.
3021800	3023360	You're doing a three hour argument
3023360	3025960	where you're doing a vast amount of reading
3025960	3028480	and also original thought.
3028480	3031160	And I just would, I'm dying to know like
3031160	3032760	a little bit about your process.
3032760	3034520	Like when you're reading a hundred books, right?
3034520	3037560	And you are trying to get your head around this argument
3037560	3038920	that you want to make.
3038920	3040480	What are you then doing with the book?
3040480	3042560	Are you, do you have a note taking process?
3042560	3046480	Like how are you assembling this argument as you go?
3046480	3049120	Yeah, my methods for making this video
3049120	3051720	were actually like so crazy that I can never do this again
3051720	3053080	because it took so long.
3053080	3054680	Like I have, okay.
3054680	3055520	I have a dog here.
3055520	3056840	How long did it take you all together by the way?
3056840	3058000	Just how long were you working on this?
3058000	3059160	I mean, I think I started it,
3059160	3063680	I think I started it in like June, 2022
3063680	3066720	and then published like March, 2024.
3066720	3069120	So more than a year and a half.
3069120	3071360	I mean, I was working on other things in between
3071360	3075200	but I think that, when I say reading a hundred books,
3075240	3077280	how long did it take me to read a hundred books?
3077280	3079200	Well, usually it takes me more than one day
3079200	3080800	to read one book.
3080800	3084200	So, you know, there were a lot of reading days.
3085160	3089080	And I had, I was writing down the quotes
3089080	3090160	that I thought were interesting.
3090160	3091760	I have a document on my computer
3091760	3095320	that has more than a hundred thousand words
3095320	3097720	of quotes and notes stuffed into it,
3097720	3100600	which is just an insane, I mean, that's,
3100600	3103920	that's, you know, at least novel length
3103960	3106080	as just a notes document.
3106080	3107800	And then most of that, obviously I didn't use
3107800	3110520	because I way overdid the note taking.
3110520	3112160	I'm not, that's why I say I'm not doing that again
3112160	3115480	because there's probably a more efficient way to use time,
3115480	3116440	which I'm trying to do
3116440	3117920	because I don't want to just make one video
3117920	3119040	every year and a half.
3120160	3121960	So I've got to find ways to be a little more efficient
3121960	3122840	than that.
3122840	3124640	But for this one project, I was like,
3124640	3128160	oh, I just, I just felt like really committing
3128160	3130280	to the bookish element of it.
3130280	3135280	So I, I made, you know, I guess a one time commitment
3135960	3139920	to just to put in basically a year's worth of research.
3139920	3142200	I really feel that making YouTube videos myself,
3142200	3144520	the pull between spending as much time
3144520	3145800	as you want on something
3145800	3148200	and getting things out more quickly.
3148200	3150440	I'm constantly trying to evaluate that myself
3150440	3152320	with the work that I make.
3153480	3155600	How do you think about, you know,
3155600	3159240	pace and, you know, nurturing your audience on YouTube?
3159240	3161920	Because as you say, you are a YouTuber.
3161920	3164600	Being a YouTuber puts you at the mercy of the algorithm,
3164600	3168400	at the, of the audience of these sort of, you know,
3168400	3172720	very mechanized processes that determine success or failure.
3172720	3174200	It seems like it would take a lot of trust
3174200	3176360	to spend a year and a half on something
3176360	3178520	and know that it will be watched on the other end
3178520	3180920	and not be anxious about, ah, shouldn't I have put out,
3180920	3182920	you know, 12 more videos in that period of time?
3182920	3184560	Wouldn't that be better for my numbers?
3184560	3185400	Like that's sort of thinking.
3185400	3186240	How do you think about that?
3186240	3187640	Oh, well, it definitely would be better for you
3187640	3189360	for my numbers if I had made 12 videos
3189360	3191520	instead of one three-hour video.
3191520	3193080	I mean, I think that for me.
3193080	3196280	Really? Because the three-hour video does well, you know.
3196280	3197400	Yeah, well, okay, that's, I mean,
3197400	3198880	I do think that long videos are,
3198880	3200880	do seem to be doing well on YouTube lately.
3200880	3203320	I think that when I was building an audience,
3203320	3204320	I would never have been able,
3204320	3206240	I don't think to do something like this.
3206240	3207880	This is, this is kind of the like,
3207880	3210600	the like luxury stuff you get to do
3210600	3215080	if you have, you have already like built that foundation.
3215080	3215920	Yeah.
3215920	3216760	I definitely think there was like a period
3216880	3219760	of having to grind a little bit to get, you know,
3219760	3221640	videos that have at least every couple of months.
3221640	3224120	And because, you know, at first you worry,
3224120	3225800	we worry, you do worry a lot about like,
3225800	3228520	oh, is the audience even going to still be there?
3228520	3230560	I feel at this point, like I have built enough
3230560	3233640	of a long-term audience that will kind of trust
3233640	3235200	the process a little bit.
3235200	3236960	And, you know, they will,
3236960	3238840	I can, I feel like I can count on them
3238840	3241040	to watch when I come up with a new thing,
3241040	3242040	even if it's been a while.
3242040	3244600	So I tend to worry about that a little less,
3244600	3247240	though I do also think that, you know,
3247240	3248640	a year and a half is too long.
3248640	3251240	And I think that I benefit from a little bit
3251240	3252800	because at a certain point with the research,
3252800	3254840	there's, there are diminishing returns
3254840	3258080	to spending more than a year on researching a video.
3258080	3259880	I think at a certain point, you know,
3259880	3261000	you have to say, okay, that's enough,
3261000	3265160	like save the rest of the research for another video.
3265160	3267760	So that's, that's from now on, I'm trying to do that
3267760	3269800	because I do, I do want to make videos
3269800	3271640	a little more frequently than once a year.
3271640	3273480	Well, it's fascinating because you could have made
3273480	3276200	just a video about, hey, I've been reading Twilight
3276200	3278640	and there was a moral panic about this series
3278640	3280680	and that misunderstands the nature of fantasy.
3280680	3283040	And that would have been one great video
3283040	3285440	that could have gotten a million views on its own,
3285440	3289040	but that is one point within this massive edifice
3289040	3290760	that you built.
3290760	3293320	And so yeah, I'm curious about,
3293320	3296640	is there some value to you in your creative process
3296640	3300760	of exploring so much in a single video
3300760	3302960	rather than chunking it up or making a more,
3302960	3306920	you know, I often look to make one discrete point, maybe two.
3306920	3308360	And if I do more than that, I start going,
3308360	3310040	ah, maybe I'm getting too over ambitious
3310040	3311760	and I need to scale it back.
3311760	3314280	Whereas this video is so incredibly maximalist
3314280	3316640	in its conception and design,
3316640	3319080	is there something about that that draws you?
3319080	3319920	Yes, there is.
3319920	3321560	And it's hard for me to explain what it is,
3321560	3325040	but I do think that that I am sort of ambitiously drawn
3325040	3327840	towards like more and more elaborate projects.
3327840	3329960	It's something that I have to like fight in myself
3329960	3332640	to not, to make every video not be three hours long,
3332640	3334200	but I do think that I like,
3334200	3335040	I don't know, there's something,
3335040	3336760	there's something fun to me to be exploring one topic
3336760	3338640	from like every possible angle.
3339600	3341600	And I don't know, there seems to be an audience
3341600	3343040	that is appreciative of that kind of like
3343040	3345240	extremely thorough deep dive.
3346200	3348440	You know, I think that,
3348440	3350520	there was a time I remember when YouTubers
3350520	3351640	were basically giving the advice,
3351640	3353160	like go no more than 10 minutes,
3353160	3355600	like no one has an attention span anymore in this day.
3355600	3357760	And now like people just regularly watch content
3357760	3358720	that's hours long.
3359560	3361040	I think part of it has to do with, you know,
3361040	3364040	the way that people watch videos has changed.
3364040	3365440	I think a lot of people, you know,
3365440	3366440	they watch a video kind of like,
3366440	3368120	kind of like they listen to a podcast, right?
3368120	3370520	It's kind of on, you know, maybe, you know,
3370520	3373080	I'm not so, I'm not so arrogant
3373080	3374920	that I think everyone who watches my videos
3374920	3378360	has to sit down at the TV with a full thing of popcorn
3378360	3380920	and give me their undivided attention.
3380920	3382600	I mean, I guess I'd be flattered if people do that,
3382600	3384480	but I'm sure, I mean, that's not how I watch video essays.
3384480	3386320	I mean, I'm doing the laundry.
3386320	3388840	YouTube is also the most popular streaming service
3388840	3389680	on television.
3389680	3391880	Like it is more popular than Netflix.
3391880	3394080	And so surely some people are doing that.
3394080	3395160	They're loading it up.
3395160	3396320	They're no longer just, you know,
3396320	3399560	clicking on a link at work, you know, in a browser tab.
3399560	3401600	And so there's been a lot of changes.
3401600	3402800	Yeah, and I do try to, I mean,
3402800	3405200	I do put effort into like visuals and things.
3405200	3408600	I do want to reward the people who have taken, you know,
3408600	3411120	who have put the video up on their TV
3411120	3412600	and are sitting down to watch it.
3412600	3414800	I do want it to make that worth people's while,
3414800	3416000	but I also know that, you know,
3416000	3418560	some people are cooking dinner and that's fine too.
3418560	3421720	You make almost every element of these videos yourself, right?
3421720	3424360	In addition to writing them, you also,
3424360	3426200	my understanding is you're your own DP.
3426200	3427040	You do your own lighting.
3427040	3428000	You do your own editing.
3428000	3430240	I believe you have other folks do the music.
3430240	3431600	Do I have that basically right?
3431600	3433240	Yeah, that's right.
3433240	3435440	I definitely, people always ask me like,
3435440	3437200	why are you doing this to yourself?
3437200	3439840	Like, why don't you hire more people to do it?
3439840	3441200	That was my next question now.
3441200	3442760	You have the money to do it.
3442760	3445600	Yeah, I feel like, well,
3445600	3447640	I think I've just gotten so used to doing it
3447640	3449440	in this kind of solitary way
3449440	3453240	that now it kind of feels like I would be like,
3453240	3456080	I don't know, I would be taking my own,
3456080	3457680	I feel like what people like about my videos
3457680	3460160	probably is that I made them on some level.
3460160	3463320	And so, I think there's something that sort of comes across
3463320	3466320	from like one person's like manic project.
3466320	3468800	Like, even, I mean, I don't know,
3468800	3470320	even if there's imperfections,
3470320	3471480	which I'm sure there are, right?
3471480	3473440	Like, there are ways that a professional
3473440	3476240	could probably like do better lighting or something.
3476240	3477760	But I don't know, there's like,
3477760	3479000	I have like the way that I do it
3479000	3480280	and I think it gives the videos
3480280	3481800	kind of a distinctive feel.
3482800	3485320	I just think it's something that people pick up on.
3485320	3487480	And also maybe it's just me being like a reclusive loner
3487480	3489800	or whatever and not wanting to deal
3489800	3493960	with the social element of having up.
3493960	3495160	No, that's such a great answer.
3495160	3496640	I mean, I've learned in my own work
3496640	3498480	how much the process is the product
3498480	3500560	and I actually experienced, you know,
3500560	3503040	I came from doing videos on a website called College Humor.
3503040	3505320	We had our low budget way of doing things
3505320	3507720	and I experienced later on
3507720	3509480	when I was doing work on Netflix,
3509480	3511160	there were things that I wanted to do
3511160	3513760	that were actually harder to do with more resources
3513760	3515560	than when I had less.
3515560	3518160	And I would try to get certain sort of gags done,
3518160	3519200	certain sort of visual effects,
3519200	3520920	try to use things on a certain timeline.
3520920	3523640	And the more expensive crews that we had to work with said,
3523640	3524760	we don't know how to do it that way.
3524760	3527040	I was like, oh, well, the 25 year old I used to work with
3527040	3528880	like could help me do it that way, right?
3528880	3530960	And so the process is the product.
3530960	3533800	The way you make the thing is how the thing comes out.
3533800	3535360	And so I understand, yeah,
3535360	3537120	if that's how you got started doing it all yourself,
3537120	3538200	that's what the audience likes.
3538200	3539200	That's the way you do it.
3539200	3541640	You maybe don't wanna fuck with something that's working
3541640	3542880	because what the audience likes
3542880	3545920	partially is the feeling of watching this lady go crazy
3545920	3547120	in her own house at 4 a.m.
3547120	3549680	You know, they like a little bit of that feeling.
3549680	3551000	I think that's exactly what it is.
3551000	3553320	Cause I think there's a certain vibe
3553320	3555040	for you for a better term
3555040	3558360	to a person like manically recording a video
3558360	3560240	in a room alone at four in the morning.
3560240	3561080	Like, I don't know.
3561080	3562800	I don't know if that could be replicated
3563080	3564920	if I weren't literally doing that.
3565840	3567160	Yeah. So I don't know.
3567160	3569000	So in terms of your audience,
3569000	3570960	you are entirely audience supported.
3570960	3573600	I don't think you take ads of any kind.
3573600	3575960	There is, that's a wonderful thing that's possible now
3575960	3578640	in today's internet media ecosystem.
3578640	3581640	It's also, there's a hazard of audience capture
3581640	3584360	of your audience driving what you're doing too much
3584360	3587000	or of feeling at the whim of your audience.
3587000	3588840	What has your experience been with that
3588840	3591440	and how do you resist that affecting your work?
3591440	3593520	Well, I am very grateful to Patreon
3593520	3597920	for allowing me to like have a financially viable career
3597920	3600440	without filling the videos with ads.
3602120	3603320	That it's a good model.
3603320	3605480	I do think that as you say,
3605480	3607240	there's a hazardous side to it,
3607240	3610160	which is that, you know, it's not the,
3610160	3611640	in a way you don't have a boss,
3611640	3615160	but in another way your boss is like this mob, right?
3615160	3616960	This group of a few thousand people
3616960	3618560	who are funding your project.
3618560	3621240	So you do, you are kind of accountable to them in a way.
3621240	3624080	So how do you not just become a people pleaser?
3624080	3624920	Yeah.
3624920	3625760	Well, I think, I mean, I've been,
3625760	3629320	lately I've been doing these like Patreon only videos
3629320	3631520	that, you know, I'm just charging people two months,
3631520	3633920	two dollars a month or whatever to watch them.
3633920	3636560	And then our people can pay more to vote on the topic.
3636560	3638200	And I do think that people who vote on topics
3638200	3640480	that are sort of, that are different than what I would,
3640480	3642120	I don't think anyone would have voted for Twilight,
3642120	3643560	for example, right?
3643560	3646080	I don't think that if I had had a poll
3646080	3647760	to decide what my next video was going to be,
3647760	3650560	I don't think Twilight would have gotten a lot of votes.
3650600	3653880	You know, people tend to vote for things,
3653880	3655120	well, one things they've heard of.
3655120	3656600	So it has to be something familiar.
3656600	3658440	It has to be often something topical.
3658440	3660280	We'll get more votes than something that's, you know,
3660280	3664000	kind of outdated or that doesn't seem particularly relevant
3664000	3664840	to the moment.
3664840	3667280	But yeah, I do think that there's something to be said
3667280	3668120	for me trying, you know,
3668120	3670800	using that kind of voting feedback
3670800	3672560	so that I kind of keep in touch
3672560	3674040	with what people care about.
3674040	3676000	But I do think that it's also good
3676000	3676880	for the main channel videos
3677520	3680480	that I'm not just taking,
3681760	3684400	that I'm not just having the topic dictated to me
3684400	3685760	by the audience demand.
3685760	3687760	Because I think a lot of times people don't know
3687760	3690880	what they want or, you know,
3690880	3693840	the most exciting content I feel like comes from,
3693840	3696400	I had no idea that I wanted this, right?
3696400	3699400	Like, I would not have asked someone to make a three hour
3699400	3702560	video analyzing Twilight from every imaginable
3702560	3705600	philosophical angle, but hopefully now that it's here,
3705800	3706640	they like it.
3708280	3710240	I think also, you know, a lot of times what you think
3710240	3713080	you want is more of what you've liked in the past,
3713080	3715920	which I think can kind of stifle,
3715920	3717800	it can stifle innovation or change where,
3717800	3719920	well, I mean, look what's happened with movies
3719920	3721880	where everything's a sequel now, right?
3721880	3725080	I think that you can become too conservative
3725080	3727640	in terms of what you are willing to experiment
3727640	3731280	with creatively if the way that you choose
3731280	3733800	what projects to work on is just informed
3733800	3735760	by what has succeeded in the past.
3735760	3737480	Well, then you just make the same thing again and again,
3737480	3740680	and no innovation ever happens.
3740680	3742320	Yeah, and if you just make the thing
3742320	3744080	that the audience says that they want,
3744080	3745360	there is some value in that.
3745360	3746400	That is something that the,
3746400	3748240	there's an value in pleasing the audience.
3748240	3749840	But if that's all that you do,
3749840	3751920	the audience is never surprised.
3751920	3754040	That's what always bothers me so much about,
3754040	3758200	you know, it's a cliche, but fans of IP media,
3758200	3760600	of superhero media or whatever, being like,
3760600	3762920	we didn't want this, this isn't what the fans asked for,
3762920	3765120	sort of discourse, why didn't they ask us
3765120	3766920	before they made the new Star Wars?
3766920	3768600	Like, well, is that what you want?
3768600	3770920	Like you didn't know, you wouldn't have known
3770920	3774400	to ask for the first Star Wars movie before it came out,
3774400	3778680	because it was a unique act of creativity
3778680	3782040	on the part of this weird dude, George Lucas.
3782040	3784160	And in fact, that was what we liked about it.
3784160	3787280	And the reappraisal of the Star Wars prequels
3787280	3789680	is exactly about that, that George was just being weird.
3789680	3791080	And that was kind of more interesting
3791080	3793760	than some mega corporation trying to give people
3793760	3795360	exactly what they wanted.
3795360	3799440	We don't get serendipity and surprise in media that way.
3799440	3800720	Yeah, I completely agree with that.
3800720	3802600	And I do think that it's too bad that,
3802600	3805800	well, I do think that I have an increasing sense,
3805800	3808120	I mean, Star Wars is probably literally the case
3808120	3809240	that a lot of creative decisions
3809240	3811920	are basically being made in corporate boardrooms.
3811920	3815880	And, yeah, I mean, it seemed, that's how it feels.
3815880	3818200	It comes across, like I liked your slogan
3818200	3819840	about the process as a product.
3819840	3822120	It comes across, right, week we can tell.
3822120	3826200	And, yeah, totally, you could just basically remake
3826200	3827680	the first Star Wars movie now,
3827680	3829640	but it wouldn't have the same impact that it had initially,
3829640	3833560	because we've already seen Star Wars make a new thing, right?
3833560	3834880	Yeah, yeah.
3836120	3838960	You are diagnosing the exact problem with my business.
3838960	3841680	Yeah, that nobody is making new things currently.
3841680	3843240	Everybody was trying to figure out,
3843240	3844880	this has worked in the past,
3844880	3846280	so let's make another one of those.
3846280	3848840	What is working and nobody is taking a chance
3848840	3850000	on the new thing.
3850000	3853080	And one of the real ironies of creative work in Hollywood,
3853080	3856040	at least, is even the executives don't know what they want,
3856040	3859680	because if they did, they would be writers and directors,
3859680	3863360	but they aren't, because they are not the creative people.
3863360	3867840	You at some point need to trust a creative person saying,
3867840	3870280	I think this is a good idea, I just wanna make it,
3870280	3871680	you should believe in me.
3871680	3876240	If you wanna get the thing that is a surprise hit,
3876240	3879640	that changes the culture or makes things go in a new way.
3879640	3881280	Yeah, it requires you to take chances,
3881280	3882880	which means that sometimes you'll lose,
3882880	3885720	but I also think that the super conservative approach to,
3885720	3888240	oh, just keep making the same thing that worked in the past.
3888240	3890520	I think that's a very short-term way of thinking,
3890520	3892960	where people will eventually get bored,
3892960	3895840	of you making the exact same superhero movie again and again.
3895840	3900520	And I think that, even economically,
3900520	3902160	that will eventually cost you,
3903160	3904760	it's worth it, I think,
3904760	3907720	to take chances on someone who's trying something new.
3907720	3909920	Sometimes it won't work, but when it does,
3910760	3911800	it really pays off.
3911800	3914080	Yeah, and that's why some of the best media brands
3914080	3915920	are the ones that you get used to
3915920	3917480	taking an interesting chance,
3917480	3920920	where, oh, if this came out, HBO used to be like this,
3920920	3922520	oh, they put a lot of money into something,
3922520	3923360	I don't know if it's for me.
3923360	3924560	You know what, I'll watch a couple,
3924560	3927400	just because I have a certain expectation.
3927400	3929760	I think people have that same expectation of your work.
3930800	3933240	Normally, I had no interest in Twilight, right?
3933240	3935400	It was not particularly on my radar,
3935400	3937360	but, oh, Natalie has a new video out
3937360	3940560	that's three hours of Natalie talking about Twilight.
3940560	3941560	I am interested in that,
3941560	3942960	because I have seen your past work,
3942960	3947120	and I know that you are going to surprise and delight me.
3947120	3949880	I love your approach of your slaking the audience's thirst
3949880	3952600	to have a say with your Patreon videos,
3952600	3954760	and then you are separately using that
3954760	3958840	to be able to fund your crazy passion products,
3958840	3960680	which are the things that people actually want of you.
3960680	3962680	That's a wonderful audience expectation to set.
3962680	3963760	Yeah, and it does require me
3963760	3966440	to have a level of trust in my own audience.
3966440	3969120	I'm trusting them to trust me, in a way.
3969120	3970960	Like, I know you probably don't think
3970960	3972240	you want a three-hour video about Twilight,
3972240	3974800	but I have an idea for one that I think you probably do want.
3974800	3977200	Just let me do it, and then we'll see.
3977200	3981320	I'm sure I will occasionally do projects that don't hit,
3981320	3982560	because no one has all hits,
3982560	3986760	but I think it's worth it to me to take the risk,
3986760	3990440	because I don't want to stultify, you know?
3991200	3995160	Do you have bigger aspirations in media?
3995160	3998240	Because, look, again, in the field I'm in,
3998240	4001000	I'm always like, my instinct is how is that a TV show?
4001000	4002240	Or how is that a movie?
4002240	4005960	Or how is that just what's the bigger version of the thing?
4005960	4009960	Which is a very capitalist fueled impulse
4009960	4011320	that comes from the media environment
4011320	4015480	that I have to work in, because that's the life I live.
4015480	4017480	Whereas you have absolute freedom,
4017480	4020760	where you're able to make a living and do what you want.
4020760	4023560	And yet, you know, this video is so ambitious.
4023560	4025880	I'm curious if you just, you know,
4025880	4028680	is there more that you want to do and in what direction?
4028680	4031000	Well, I'm pretty happy with the current process.
4031000	4032360	I mean, is there more that I want to do?
4032360	4034400	Yes, but I feel like the more that I want to do
4034400	4038280	is not necessarily what most people imagine I would want to do.
4038280	4039240	People ask me all the time,
4039240	4041960	like, aren't you going to have like a Netflix show
4041960	4043240	or something at some point?
4043240	4045560	Or, you know, when are you going to like have a,
4045560	4047360	I mean, they don't say when you're going to have a real job,
4047360	4048920	but there's some, there's some of these things
4048920	4050760	like a little bit of an implication of that.
4050760	4052440	When are you going to make it big, right?
4052440	4053680	That's the idea, that's the implication.
4053680	4054840	Yeah, when are you going to make it big?
4054840	4058840	I'm pretty happy making it medium, actually, at the moment.
4058840	4061560	Like, I think that I like the independence
4061560	4065600	and I like the fact that I can do like weird experimental things.
4066440	4069240	And I like the kind of direct relationship to the audience
4069240	4071040	that I feel like I have through Patreon,
4071040	4073600	where it's not mediated by a studio.
4073600	4074440	I don't know.
4074440	4077480	There's not to say that I will never try, you know,
4077480	4082760	doing something that is with a more conventional,
4082760	4084720	you know, production approach.
4084720	4086960	But I feel like for the time being,
4086960	4090560	I'm pretty happy with the way that this works out
4090560	4092800	with Patreon and with the audience on YouTube.
4092800	4096760	And so I'm not like itching to change it up in that sense.
4096760	4098000	Yeah, I would also ask,
4098000	4099600	oh, would you ever want to write a book?
4099600	4104200	Except that again, the video to me has the density of a book.
4104200	4106920	Every sentence is something that I want to pause and unpack
4106920	4110720	and reread, and yet is being seen by more people.
4110720	4113760	You are able to, I think, probably make a better living at it
4113760	4116360	than you would if you were to publish it as a book.
4116360	4120000	Is there, it seems kind of perfect
4120000	4122720	for getting the ideas that you want to get out out.
4122720	4124920	And yet I think there's maybe a YouTube stench
4124920	4128600	that I feel as well of, isn't there some
4128600	4130920	more legitimate place to go?
4130920	4132920	No, I mean, people asked that too, right?
4132920	4134160	When are you going to write a book?
4134160	4135680	Well, I don't know, I might write a book.
4135680	4137000	I may well write a book someday,
4137000	4138920	probably when I get tired of looking
4138920	4140200	at my face on the screen.
4140200	4145200	But I think that I feel like I've put so much time
4145720	4148720	into learning the skills of doing video essays
4148720	4151240	that I feel like I may still continue doing the thing
4151240	4152360	that I know I'm good at.
4152360	4153880	I mean, part of that, of course, is writing.
4153880	4156400	And I'm sure that that skill would transfer over
4156400	4157320	to writing a book.
4158520	4161880	So again, I think I haven't ruled that out.
4161880	4163840	I imagine myself writing a book someday,
4163840	4166440	but for the time being, all the ideas that I have
4166440	4168520	for books, I feel like I end up making them into videos.
4168520	4172160	So it's not, it doesn't seem like a super pressing need
4172160	4175120	for me to switch media.
4175120	4177080	I don't feel that you'll ever get sick
4177080	4177960	of looking at your own face.
4177960	4179360	If you spent this long doing it,
4179360	4182920	you have the same sickness that I do where...
4182920	4185120	If the narcissism has lasted this long,
4185120	4187080	I should be in the clear, right?
4187080	4188760	Yeah, if you want this many people,
4188760	4189960	if you have spent this much time
4189960	4191080	trying to get people to look at you,
4191080	4192520	you must want people to do it.
4192520	4194120	That's never gonna leave you.
4194120	4197560	Yeah, it's a long-term personality defect.
4199000	4200560	What have you been thinking about
4200560	4203120	or reading more recently that is...
4203120	4205320	I mean, this video took you a year and a half.
4205320	4206840	It came out a few months ago.
4206840	4209040	What directions do you find yourself being pulled now
4209040	4210240	in terms of your interests?
4210240	4213200	Well, I spent so much time on this Twilight video
4213200	4214960	that I net like for the last few months,
4214960	4216800	I just avoid anything romance fiction.
4216800	4218840	I'm like, I thought about it for a year and a half.
4218840	4219680	I can't stand it.
4219720	4221600	In another year, I'm sure it'll interest me again
4221600	4222800	and I'll go back to it.
4222800	4225280	But yeah, I definitely will do something
4225280	4226800	completely different next.
4226800	4229040	Obviously, well, I'm very anxious
4229040	4232080	about American politics this year.
4232080	4235120	So I think probably I'll get something
4235120	4238040	sort of a little bit more directly political,
4238040	4239520	politically engaging next.
4239520	4242080	I've been doing research for most of my adult life
4242080	4243480	on conspiracy theories.
4243480	4245800	So that's something that definitely interests me
4245800	4247480	as a possible topic.
4247480	4248320	And those go together.
4248360	4250320	I mean, American politics this year
4250320	4252400	and conspiracy theories, it feels like we're living
4252400	4255080	in a more conspiratorial politics than ever.
4255080	4257240	I remember a time when conspiracism
4257240	4259800	was this kind of counter-cultural thing
4259800	4262560	like in the Bush era or early Obama years.
4262560	4264160	But now, yeah, it's fun.
4264160	4267600	It was like, you know, Men in Black was a movie, right?
4267600	4269880	It wasn't something that people actually believed in.
4269880	4271960	Right, or it was, I mean,
4271960	4275920	I guess there was always the 9-11 truth stuff and that.
4275960	4279680	But even that, it never seemed very threatening to me.
4279680	4281600	I guess, I don't know, but maybe it should have
4281600	4283800	because now, I mean, at this stage,
4283800	4286000	like the Republican Party may as well be
4286000	4291000	a conspiracist party where like central ideas of Trump
4291000	4293480	include the idea that the elections are rigged.
4293480	4298320	So that's not, you know, this is not counter-culture anymore.
4298320	4299680	This guy was president.
4299680	4301040	He's friends with Alex Jones,
4301040	4303440	or at least they're in communication.
4303440	4306520	So this is, you know,
4306520	4308640	I've been talking with some people lately
4308640	4311680	about whether QAnon is totally irrelevant now.
4311680	4314080	And I think that it's not irrelevant.
4314080	4315600	But the reason that it's not irrelevant
4315600	4318640	is that it's actually, a lot of the pieces of QAnon
4318640	4323640	have just become incorporated into the main of the Republican Party.
4324760	4328480	So, you know, yeah, we're not talking about Q,
4328480	4332880	but the idea that the deep state is rigging elections,
4332880	4334640	for example, or the idea, like all this stuff
4334640	4337840	is basically just mainstream American political ideas now.
4337840	4344680	So it's, you know, it's a long-standing tendency,
4344680	4345880	I guess, in American politics.
4345880	4347520	Like there's that essay from the 60s
4347520	4350960	on the paranoid style in American politics
4350960	4353200	about like the Goldwater campaign, I guess.
4353200	4354960	And, you know, in the 50s and 60s,
4354960	4356800	there was like the John Birch Society
4356800	4358440	and all this idea of, you know,
4358440	4360160	like you see in Dr. Strangelove,
4360160	4362080	where there's this character ranting about
4362080	4365080	the fluoridation of water being a communist plot.
4365080	4366080	So it's not like this is new.
4366080	4367080	Yeah, I guess our vital fluids, yeah.
4367080	4370480	Yeah, the pressure is bodily fluids,
4370480	4371520	which I guess is kind of like a,
4371520	4374800	this kind of like a predecessor to the anti-vax movement.
4374800	4377400	This is the stuff I'm thinking about lately.
4377400	4379280	Like I would have been an RFK voter.
4379280	4380120	Yeah, completely.
4380120	4384040	Have you, and yeah, the conspiracy mindset,
4384040	4386480	it's not just that the literal conspiracy theories
4386480	4387640	have infected the Republican Party,
4387640	4391440	but the sort of behavior of conspiracy hunting
4391440	4393200	has infected almost everybody.
4393200	4395320	You see Democrats or, you know,
4395320	4397880	people who don't call themselves political at all,
4397880	4400200	just go down these rabbit holes constantly
4400200	4403920	of and undermine everything that they think they know,
4403920	4406280	et cetera, with that type of thinking,
4406280	4410240	even when it isn't specifically a right-wing conspiracy theory
4410240	4411920	of the type that we're most used to.
4411920	4413880	Yeah, it's really a style,
4413880	4416080	maybe a style of, I mean, paranoid style, right?
4416080	4418280	It's a style of thinking more than anything
4418280	4420640	that can be applied to like literally anything.
4420640	4422320	I mean, I feel like it's gotten to a point
4422320	4425680	where any significant event that happens in American
4425680	4430680	or world politics or news will be kind of,
4430680	4434000	it will have like a host of theories around it
4434000	4435360	about how it's an inside job,
4435360	4437400	or it's a hoax, or it's this and that, right?
4437400	4438920	I think it's just become a kind of-
4438920	4441680	The Kate Middleton photo is a perfect example of that, right?
4441680	4444360	I mean, Taylor Swift will drop an album and there's people
4444360	4446400	theorizing about how she's just secretly gay,
4446400	4448840	and she's like, I mean, it's everything.
4449800	4452200	Yeah, my friend, the very funny comedian, Sammi Mauri,
4452200	4455440	said that Taylor Swift is queuing on for girls.
4455440	4456720	That's their joke.
4456720	4457880	Yeah, it's a truth.
4457880	4460360	And people are like connecting the red string,
4460360	4462040	like between Taylor Swift songs.
4462040	4466600	That is the accepted mode of consumption
4466600	4469680	for the biggest mainstream pop artist in America,
4469680	4473480	is to treat her like you are uncovering a vast conspiracy.
4473480	4475640	Right, and she's dropping these like cryptic clues,
4475640	4478240	and it's your job to like to go down the rabbit hole
4478240	4480120	and figure out the truth.
4480120	4482360	It's, yeah, I mean, people seem to find this way
4482360	4486080	of engaging with anything very, very exciting, right?
4486080	4488120	I think it kind of, it puts you in the role
4488120	4489720	of an investigator, right?
4489720	4491360	Everyone thinks they're Sherlock Holmes,
4491360	4494640	and you feel like you can find some kind of truth
4494640	4496000	that has been hidden.
4496000	4497200	I think that there's something,
4497200	4498600	I mean, maybe this takes us back
4498600	4500040	to the romance topic, actually,
4500040	4505040	because in a way, that desire to like find what is concealed,
4505520	4508240	or like overcome some kind of veil of illusion,
4508240	4510720	I feel that that in itself is a kind of like,
4511600	4513800	you know, tension and release type thing,
4513800	4517360	where, you know, why is a hidden truth
4517360	4520200	is more exciting than an open truth, right?
4520200	4521040	Yeah.
4521040	4524440	Because there's this element of pursuit of search involved.
4524440	4527400	So it's exciting to discover a secret, I guess.
4527400	4530560	And so people go looking for secrets anywhere.
4530560	4533400	I mean, I literally have just been playing a video game
4533400	4535040	called Animal Well that is entirely built
4535040	4536640	around the search for secrets.
4536640	4540240	And that's like the, there's the motivating factor
4540240	4543760	in the game, and that's sort of an odd thing to bring up,
4543760	4545160	but it's literally what it reminded me of.
4545160	4547520	Oh, I was doing this for fun just last week
4547520	4548800	of like hunting, hunting.
4548800	4549640	What does this mean?
4549640	4550960	What does that mean?
4550960	4552800	I love the connection, though, to,
4554840	4556920	I believe you said in the video,
4556920	4559920	this is just written in my list of quotes.
4559920	4561360	You wrote philosophical questions
4561360	4563440	that would never be definitively answered
4563440	4565120	as being part of their allure, I think,
4565120	4567200	and like our desire to answer them.
4567200	4569000	They can't be definitively answered.
4569000	4570360	So we're always questing after them.
4570360	4571200	Is that correct?
4571200	4572040	Am I misrepresenting you?
4572040	4574720	Yeah, I think that's part of the appeal of philosophy
4574720	4577200	is that there's, you know, we're asking these big questions
4577200	4579960	that seem to defy definitive solution.
4580920	4581760	Yeah.
4581760	4583600	And so I think that is part of what's exciting about it
4583600	4586160	is the desire to find out something
4586160	4589120	that is, that seems like it's always eluding us.
4589240	4590640	So I wanted to ask,
4590640	4594120	because this is a question of perpetual fascination for me,
4594120	4596640	what do you think it is that philosophy does?
4596640	4599720	Because there's often, you know,
4599720	4603160	a realization I had after being very, very intent
4603160	4605960	and fascinated by philosophy for many years,
4605960	4608520	I realized, hold on a second, exactly this,
4608520	4610520	none of these questions are ever answered, you know?
4610520	4612960	People are still arguing with Plato and Descartes
4612960	4615360	and every philosopher for hundreds of years.
4615360	4616640	And so isn't that shameful
4616640	4618760	that philosophy never makes progress
4618760	4619800	in the way that science does?
4619800	4622000	Ever had essays to that effect?
4622000	4624680	I was talking to the philosopher Quill Kukla about this
4624680	4627120	and they said that what they think it indicates
4627120	4630240	is that philosophy is more of an art than a science
4630240	4631760	or a practice.
4631760	4634320	I'm just curious how you think of it.
4634320	4637680	Like what is the thing that you are trying to do
4637680	4640280	when you are answering these questions
4640280	4642760	if they can never be definitively answered?
4642760	4644560	Well, I think it does a lot of different things.
4644560	4647480	One thing it maybe does is take a mystery
4647480	4649440	and then clarify the mystery
4649440	4652360	so that even if you don't have a definitive answer,
4652360	4654080	you at least have a better understanding
4654080	4656400	of what it is that you don't understand.
4658400	4660400	I think another thing I can do is kind of,
4662320	4665000	again, like sort of clarify concepts that are kind of murky
4665000	4668000	or sort of bring out something that's sort of implicit
4668000	4670800	and make it explicit in a discourse.
4670800	4673200	So I mean, this I think has a potential
4673200	4674960	to be useful to science, right?
4674960	4679840	At least in certain fields where maybe there's a question of,
4682200	4684600	I guess psychology comes to mind where,
4684600	4686400	what are we talking about?
4686400	4688840	When we talk about consciousness
4688840	4690880	versus being unconscious,
4690880	4692800	that the question actually kind of
4692800	4695000	is conceptually complicated in a way
4695000	4697080	that is not clear to me,
4697080	4700400	that it's easily solved just through experimentation.
4700400	4701760	Before doing an experiment,
4701760	4704360	you have to have a conceptual framework
4704360	4706040	for what it is that you're testing.
4706040	4708960	Yeah, and in fact, on this show in recent months,
4708960	4711320	we've had on different neuroscientists
4711320	4713560	who are arguing between themselves
4713560	4716400	about whether humans have free will, et cetera.
4716400	4719480	And my reaction to all of them is you have committed
4719480	4721480	a philosophical error in that you don't know
4721480	4723000	what you mean by the phrase free will yet,
4723000	4725240	or that's the disagreement and you won't acknowledge it.
4725240	4729600	Like that sort of problem is a classic one
4729600	4731200	that can only be addressed by philosophy.
4731200	4733440	Yeah, I don't think the question of,
4733480	4736760	do humans have free will and in what sense, if so,
4736760	4738920	or if not, I don't think that's a question
4738920	4743480	that's going to be answered by doing functional MRI scans
4743480	4744320	of the brain.
4744320	4746960	There's a certain type of evidence
4746960	4750240	that MRI studies are going to supply,
4750240	4751600	and that certain type of evidence
4751600	4755000	is always going to have to do with what amount of blood
4755000	4756880	is flowing to which brain region,
4756880	4759760	which is not gonna really answer your free will question.
4759760	4763200	You kind of need to like to transform that
4763200	4766280	into something that can be empirically verified.
4766280	4768840	I think so, but yeah, the question about free will
4768840	4770640	is what do we mean by free will
4770640	4772600	and what is the relationship between free will
4772600	4777600	and say chemistry or these seemingly deterministic
4778040	4779600	levels of analysis?
4779600	4782680	Yeah, we might not get a final understand,
4782680	4785120	we might not get a final answer to that question,
4785120	4786360	but if we actually examine it,
4786360	4789400	we might understand a lot more about ourselves
4789400	4790600	than like all of these other things.
4790600	4793280	In the same way that you're exploring twilight
4793280	4795840	and you are coming to what I found fascinating conclusions
4795840	4800400	about human sexuality, fantasy, genre fiction,
4800400	4803880	you know, gender itself, I mean,
4803880	4807800	it's just such an incredible tour de force, I don't know.
4807800	4810360	Are you happy with a response to the video?
4810360	4813000	Like are people, are they taking it in the way
4813000	4813920	that you hoped that they would?
4813920	4815240	Yeah, I'm very happy with it.
4815240	4818400	I think that a lot of people have given it a chance
4818400	4822280	and I'm always very appreciative of the kinds of comments
4822280	4823800	that people leave on my videos.
4823800	4826920	I feel like I am proud to have a better
4826920	4829640	than average YouTube comments section.
4829640	4832200	People often like write paragraphs of texts
4832200	4833680	and some of it is very, very interesting.
4833680	4835560	People have their own ideas and insights
4835560	4838000	where people will challenge a certain point I made.
4838000	4839680	I'm always very appreciative of people
4839680	4841600	taking the time to do that
4841600	4843480	because I know these comments just get lost
4843480	4845520	in a sea of comments, but I do try,
4845520	4847360	I do read a lot of them and a lot of them,
4847360	4849080	unfortunately, are actually worth reading.
4849080	4851640	So yeah, I'm happy about that.
4851640	4854600	I mean, you really like strike me as a,
4854600	4856520	a philosopher from a few hundred years ago,
4856520	4858120	like reading your correspondences,
4858120	4859200	you know, you publish your monograph
4859200	4861800	and then you get all the responses back
4861800	4864040	and people debate and et cetera.
4864040	4869360	It's just fascinating to see work of this caliber
4869360	4871600	come across on a platform that most people to write
4871600	4875160	as being really superficial and stupid
4875640	4877920	and you're one of the most, you know,
4877920	4879200	successful and popular YouTubers
4879200	4880760	and you're doing honest to God philosophy
4880760	4882280	and psychology and analysis on there.
4882280	4885080	It's, I don't know, it's, it's incredible to see.
4886080	4887400	Yeah, sorry, go.
4887400	4889440	Yeah, the feedback is definitely one of the things
4889440	4890520	I like about YouTube.
4890520	4893160	As you say, a YouTube comment section has a reputation
4893160	4896000	as being like the worst of what the internet has to offer.
4896000	4899880	It certainly can be, but I think that I also, you know,
4899880	4900880	it's a mix of things.
4900880	4902920	Like some people just say that I'm ugly or whatever.
4902920	4904080	So, okay, thank you.
4904080	4906760	But, you know, I think that mixed in with that
4906760	4908280	is a lot of people who are leaving
4908280	4910000	actually very thoughtful ideas
4910000	4912960	and it's actually something I look forward to
4912960	4914000	whenever I publish a video
4914000	4916600	is like seeing what people will say in response.
4916600	4919520	It's almost like I want people to like challenge me back.
4919520	4922520	Like, I want people to engage with what I'm thinking about
4922520	4923760	because I know they'll come up, you know,
4923760	4924920	people have different experiences,
4924920	4926520	they have different expertise and I do,
4926520	4927640	they'll come up with a bunch of stuff
4927640	4928640	that I didn't occur to me.
4928640	4930640	And it's always very interesting to,
4930640	4932720	to see like how other people react
4932720	4935920	to like the incomplete ideas that I've had.
