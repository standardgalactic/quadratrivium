00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Hello and welcome to Factually, I'm Adam Conover.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,600
Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,800
You know, you may have noticed that I spend a lot of time

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,000
talking shit about the wealthy on this show,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,320
how they hoard their wealth,

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,120
go to war against their own workers,

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,560
and are in the process of destroying the planet

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,980
all to protect their precious golden treasure.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,400
And I think a lot of you might feel the same way.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,200
That might be why you watch this show and you're not alone.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,440
The American economy has gotten more and more unfair

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,520
and frankly fucked up over the past 50 years

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,000
and people have taken notice.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,640
You don't need to be an economist

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,960
to know that there's something bad

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,680
about the top 10% of a society hoarding 2 thirds of its wealth

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,640
or about a country where wages since 1979

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,000
have grown over five times faster for the top 1%

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,220
than for the bottom 90%.

20
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,220
As a result, in recent years,

21
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,120
we have seen left-leaning social movements coalesce

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,960
in order to fight this injustice.

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,200
First, during the Occupy Wall Street movement,

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,080
then in the 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders

25
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,960
and more recently in the emergence of groups

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,280
like the Democratic Socialists of America,

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,520
the word socialism is now a part

28
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,160
of our political conversation in a way it simply wasn't

29
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,680
in 2008 or 2000 or 1992.

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
But while that's true,

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,200
it still hasn't fully entered our political mainstream.

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,280
You haven't seen a lot of socialist senators

33
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,660
or even many members of the house yet.

34
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,240
And here's the really weird part.

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,400
The same is not true for the far right of our politics.

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,000
I mean, the current GOP presidential candidate

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,880
is open about wanting to cut the modest social safety net

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,720
we do have, reducing social security and Medicare,

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,840
lowering taxes on the rich incorporations

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,980
and gutting environmental regulations,

41
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,280
all while enacting a wildly regressive,

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,360
frankly fascist social agenda

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,920
that will reduce the rights for women

44
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,940
and target immigrants for deportation.

45
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,720
I mean, I will grant that Bernie Sanders

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,440
is very popular for a socialist

47
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,160
in the context of American history,

48
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,600
but there simply isn't a Bernie army

49
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
the same way there is a MAGA army.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,640
There are a hundred times as many elected MAGA leaders

51
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,040
as socialists in American government today.

52
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,840
Despite all of the left successes, why is that?

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,320
Well, to answer that question,

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,280
we have an incredible guest on the show today.

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,240

And now let's introduce today's guest.

68
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,120
Bhaskar Sankara is president of the nation magazine,

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,880
the founding editor of Jacobin,

70
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,620
and the author of a book called The Socialist Manifesto,

71
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,240
the case for radical politics

72
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,440
and an era of extreme inequality.

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
Please welcome Bhaskar Sankara.

74
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,240
Bhaskar, thank you so much for being on the show.

75
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,160
Thanks for having me.

76
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,480
I feel like it's long overdue

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,800
because a lot of the issues that you write about

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
in your work and that you cover

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,000
are issues we've discussed on this show.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,440
And you identify as a socialist and a leftist.

81
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,720
I think that it's a really interesting time

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,360
for those ideas in America because on the one hand,

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,600
you see them spreading or becoming more popular

84
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,920
in the public to some degree,

85
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,200
in the policy apparatus to some degree.

86
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,360
And yet the number of people,

87
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,560
I saw a Pew research study,

88
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
a number of people who have positive views

89
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,840
of socialism is going down and is much lower

90
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,400
than people have positive views of capitalism.

91
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,160
Take those broad surveys for what they are,

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,480
but it's sort of like, is this growing or is it not?

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,640
How do you feel about the overall prospects

94
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,200
for leftist politics and these policies

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,720
in America right now?

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,840
Well, I think 10 years ago,

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,000
you could say socialism in America as a current,

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,720
even as an opposition movement,

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,360
was basically dead.

100
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,280
And now you could say it's on life support.

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,360
It depends on your perspective.

102
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,880
I was like, oh, she's doing good.

103
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,400
She's only in a coma now.

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,080
So we'll see what happens in a couple of years.

105
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
Yeah.

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,760
Exactly.

107
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,000
So I think that for me, it feels fantastic.

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,840
I became a card-carrying member

109
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,560
of the Democratic Socialist of America.

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,640
Not actually card-carrying

111
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,320
because there were two dysfunctional

112
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,640
to actually get me a card at the time.

113
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,960
In April 2007, there was about 5,000 of us

114
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,760
and I was among the youngest members.

115
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,480
I joined right before my 18th birthday.

116
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,080
And today there's around 100,000 members of DSA,

117
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,520
the Democratic Socialist of America.

118
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,280
Jacobin, the Socialist magazine I founded,

119
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,120
has around 66,000 or so subscribers.

120
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,720
There is a base and obviously between having Bernie Sanders

121
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,440
as a self-identified Democratic Socialist,

122
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,960
politicians like Alexander Kasiroportez,

123
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,040
there is a small amount

124
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,040
of highly visible Democratic Socialists in public life.

125
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,360
And that's not something we had in the recent past

126
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,000
in the US and in that sense, it's doing great.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Now, is it ready to storm the barricades

128
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,040
and really change American society

129
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,520
in a fundamental way?

130
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,480
Maybe not, but for a opposition movement

131
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,280
that's just getting its legs, I'm not too disappointed.

132
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,080
Well, let's talk about Bernie Sanders

133
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,480
because when his first few campaigns,

134
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,000
they grew to such size, they ended up powering a movement.

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,080
The movement continued in many ways,

136
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,120
which resulted in the growth of the DSA.

137
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,120
But if you contrast that with Donald Trump's movement,

138
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,600
and I don't wanna create an equivalency there,

139
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
but there are some similarities,

140
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,640
his movement has taken over an entire party

141
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,520
and has the Democratic Socialist movement,

142
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,360
you can say, oh, there's a mayor over here,

143
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,040
there's some state legislatures over there,

144
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,560
you've got here in LA, we have, I believe,

145
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,080
three city council people out of 15

146
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,400
who are members or at least associated with the DSA.

147
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,880
Hey, yeah, those are successes for the movement,

148
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,600
but the MAGA movement has representatives,

149
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,440
senators, governors, et cetera,

150
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,800
and hey, they don't win every election yada yada,

151
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,320
but in terms of the way that it has been injected

152
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,040
into the mainstream of American politics

153
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,040
in this stunningly swift way is kind of in sharp contrast

154
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,800
to what happened to the Bernie Sanders movement

155
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,840
or the relative success.

156
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,120
So what do you credit that to,

157
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,240
or do you think that the comparison I'm drawing

158
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,640
is false entirely, which you may?

159
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,400
Well, I think that it's always easier

160
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,040
to organize big money and you get some organic backing

161
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,240
from ordinary people in the interests of capital.

162
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,880
So fundamentally, Donald Trump's appeal was,

163
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm a businessman, I know what I have, make deals,

164
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,320
I'm gonna cut a better deal for you,

165
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,000
ordinary American, and also for American business

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,160
in the world.

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,200
And I think that's an easier appeal to make than,

168
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,280
my name is Bernie Sanders, I'm an outsider,

169
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,680
I wanna take on millionaires and billionaires,

170
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,760
can you loan me $27?

171
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,680
And I promise I'll spend your money well, fly economy,

172
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,840
and travel around the country, getting my message out.

173
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,480
And I think that the Sanders route was a lot tougher.

174
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,520
Trump was tapping into, I think,

175
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,880
a continuum of Republican politics.

176
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,240
We don't even think of it that way,

177
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,360
but the Tea Party to Trump, I think had common threads.

178
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,680
And the hysteria that Trump whipped up

179
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,200
around Obama's birth certificate was kind of part

180
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,680
of tapping into that old Tea Party base,

181
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,400
but radicalizing it.

182
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,280
Then he was able to, with his own gifts as an orator,

183
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,880
he might not appeal to everyone,

184
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,000
but he obviously is a skilled communicator

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,200
in a certain way, and an entertainer, you know?

186
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I mean, the guy will riff for three hours

187
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,640
and get a stretch about everybody he hates,

188
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,120
and that's, you know, just as a stand-up comic,

189
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,680
like that's impressive, and the guy gets laughs, you know?

190
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,840
It is a feat of oration, what he does.

191
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,080
And he has a cadence, he has, just as a performer,

192
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,280
I think he has his skills, you know?

193
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,960
Bernie always seems like he's a bit tired and fed up,

194
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,760
which he is at this point, he has every right to be,

195
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,080
but Trump was able to combine his natural gifts,

196
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,240
the space that he had cultivated,

197
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,320
and radicalized a bit with the Obama birthday stuff,

198
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
with a lot of his own money,

199
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,960
and a very hollowed-out Republican party

200
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,320
that he just knew how to pick apart.

201
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,960
And by the time they realized that it was too late

202
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,920
to, they needed to stop him, it was too late,

203
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,360
whereas the DNC realized they had to stop Bernie,

204
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,560
but it wasn't too late, you know?

205
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
That Obama was able to make a few calls,

206
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,160
and Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris,

207
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,720
and others were able to, from their perspective,

208
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,720
did the smart thing, rally behind Joe Biden,

209
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,200
Joe Biden winning the election.

210
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,520
So on their own terms, they made a good decision,

211
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,760
but they were unable to stop Trump.

212
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,760
But I do think that maybe a stronger comparison

213
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,160
to Trump would be, and I say this to someone

214
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,520
who's generally a supporter of a lot of his policies,

215
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,320
would be someone like Amalon, Mexico,

216
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,720
who's been able to combine some of his oratory and charisma,

217
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,560
and somewhat strongman personality,

218
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,880
but combine it with a genuinely progressive agenda.

219
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,920
I think Bernie was always, in the United States,

220
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,160
doing something a little bit different

221
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,960
and a more difficult task, given our context.

222
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,360
Mm, and draw that comparison a little bit more

223
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,080
between Amalon who, in Mexico,

224
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
and what Bernie did that's more difficult.

225
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,240
Just pull that out some more.

226
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,480
Yeah, I think that, first of all,

227
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,200
Amal was someone who ran multiple times for president.

228
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,600
He arguably won in 2006.

229
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,040
He had the election, again, some people say,

230
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,000
stolen from him then, but either way,

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,200
he was a very well-known national figure.

232
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,280
He is someone who came from a lot of the historical networks

233
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,080
that they left, but he figured out

234
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,320
that he had to leave and abandon some of those networks

235
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,640
and ways of talking and try to articulate

236
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,120
a more populist framework

237
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,760
for explaining who he was to the Mexican people

238
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,920
and what his appeal was about.

239
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,280
It was not just the regular left-wing appeals

240
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,320
about redistribution and taking on the wealthy,

241
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,560
but he combined it with this idea of fighting corruption

242
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,360
and fighting to preserve the sanctity and purity

243
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,200
of Mexican republicanism

244
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,160
in a national, popular sense.

245
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,440
Bernie Sanders, in the same way,

246
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,800
came from the hard left, really, in the United States.

247
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,360
He was a member of the Young People's Socials League,

248
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,680
which just sounds incredibly anachronistic,

249
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,560
as if anyone, all the people I know

250
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,040
who are members of the Young People's Socials League

251
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
are, like, 85 years old.

252
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
Right, they're not young anymore.

253
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,560
At the reunions, they're all on walkers, yeah.

254
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,720
He joined in the left,

255
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,200
there was before the new left, really.

256
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,520
Like, he was interested in this

257
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,800
when he was at Brooklyn College

258
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,840
and later on at the University of Chicago.

259
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,480
So we're talking about pretty early on in the 1960s.

260
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,800
I actually know a guy,

261
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,880
I'm not sure if he wants me to cite him,

262
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,240
but he's like,

263
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,440
he loves to tell me stories about this period

264
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920
because he was a leftist in the late 50s and the 60s.

265
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,920
And often, you can't really trust all of his stories

266
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,200
that he once told me.

267
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
So then I told the Black Panther Party,

268
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,080
your slogan shouldn't be free Huey Newton,

269
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,800
it should just be free Huey.

270
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,640
But...

271
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,400
So take this with a grain of salt,

272
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,000
but you can tell me,

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,480
he recruited Bernie Sanders

274
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,400
to not just the Young People's Socials League.

275
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,160
And that, I think, is the established fact

276
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,400
that he did that in the University of Chicago.

277
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,440
But he recruited him to the,

278
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,440
the Shackmanite kind of Trotsky-oriented fraction

279
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,920
of the Young People's Socials League

280
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,040
in the early 1960s.

281
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,000
So Bernie was very steeply entrenched in the left.

282
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,480
I mean, Bernie, I used to do a joke on stage

283
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
about how Bernie came to LA

284
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,240
when he was running the second time.

285
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,720
And he gave a speech about,

286
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
you should all be so proud,

287
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,600
you have the dodges,

288
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,400
because we were all so sad in Brooklyn

289
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,440
when the dodges moved to LA.

290
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,520
And I was like, wow,

291
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,480
that's the moment I realized he was too old to be president.

292
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,000
Like you can't go around telling people

293
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,480
that you remember when the Dodgers left Brooklyn.

294
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,800
Like that is the oldest school thing possible.

295
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,760
That's like history books have been written about this.

296
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,440
So he's steeped in that sort of like mid-century America

297
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
in this very specific way.

298
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,080
Yeah, and exactly, I think that was part of his strength

299
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,640
because he both left behind that existing laughter.

300
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,240
He moved to Vermont in a place that he could,

301
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,040
he could really find a way to influence politics

302
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,960
at a bigger, bigger scale.

303
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
But he kept a lot of its allegiance

304
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,280
to the old bread and butter,

305
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,880
simple way of talking about things.

306
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,840
And often when people say that,

307
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,320
that could be a euphemism for,

308
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,040
let's not talk about gay people.

309
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,760
Let's not talk about racial justice and so on.

310
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,280
But Bernie Sanders is a product of the new left.

311
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,880
He's a product of the civil rights movement.

312
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,120
He's someone who went to Vermont to try to farm,

313
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,760
which is kind of just a crazy thought in and of itself

314
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,160
that kind of back to the land movement.

315
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,880
You would think they would maybe pick somewhere

316
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,240
a little bit more fertile than in his book.

317
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,320
I always wondered how he got to Vermont from Brooklyn.

318
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,080
He literally, it was part of like the back to the land,

319
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,600
like let's start a little homestead

320
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,320
in New England hippie movement.

321
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,920
I'm not sure if he intended to like survive by farming,

322
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,520
but it was definitely let's get a cabin,

323
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,160
let's get a little land.

324
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,000
Wow.

325
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,200
The same book where he talks kind of about,

326
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,640
the New York trolley dodgers or whatever,

327
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,160
the Brooklyn trolley dodgers leave in town

328
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,840
and him getting upset.

329
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,640
He also talks about surviving that first winter,

330
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,640
which was one of the worst winters in modern history

331
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,480
in terms of temperature and whatnot

332
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,440
and not having proper heat and trying to find enough

333
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,160
to burn, to stay warm.

334
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,520
He obviously has a little bit of that hippie-gippy

335
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,360
left in him, but he had a very simple message

336
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,760
and he said the same thing in his first run

337
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,240
in the early 1970s for office,

338
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,480
all the way up to his 2016 run,

339
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,520
which was millionaires control too much

340
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,480
of this country's wealth.

341
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,880
He would give the same percentage,

342
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,600
X percentage of people control Y percentage of the wealth,

343
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,920
same framing, same syntax.

344
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,600
And in a way, I think the very old,

345
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,200
somewhat mid-century New York ethnic accent

346
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,360
combined with that straight talk,

347
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,240
I think it resonated deeply in a lot of people.

348
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,240
It made somewhat radical ideas seem accessible,

349
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
comprehensible.

350
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,840
Yeah, and I made him seem authentic.

351
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,120
This guy's been saying the same thing.

352
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,320
It made it clear that he was authentic, honestly.

353
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,920
That this guy has been saying these same things

354
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,520
for the last 50 years, he comes by it honestly

355
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,360
and we can take him at his word.

356
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,680
But to your point about,

357
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,120
and I don't wanna spend the entire time

358
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,000
relitigating the last couple of elections,

359
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,240
but you're correct that there was a concerted effort

360
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,000
by the Democratic Party to beat him

361
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,800
because Obama and that wing of the party

362
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,600
thought that Bernie couldn't win

363
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,600
and they teamed up to consolidate and beat him.

364
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,840
And I've heard that narrative before

365
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,560
talking to folks in the DSA,

366
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,720
folks who are big Bernie supporters,

367
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,040
ah, Bernie got screwed by the Democratic Party,

368
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,840
but there were also people trying to screw Trump,

369
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,480
maybe not as well.

370
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,200
And you do at some point have to win, right?

371
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,560
Like, Bernie's argument or the argument

372
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,720
of a lot of Bernie supporters were,

373
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,360
well, Bernie would have beaten Trump,

374
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,840
but okay, and would have beaten him the first time as well

375
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,000
in the Hillary Clinton election.

376
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,800
And okay, that's a hypothetical,

377
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,960
but a good piece of support for the hypothetical would be

378
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,080
if he had won the primary.

379
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,560
If you want to prove that your political movement

380
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,520
has the goods, has the juice to sweep the entire country,

381
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,920
then it would be helpful to win the primary first.

382
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,160
And Bernie had a lot of support,

383
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,480
but it's like, hey, was it just that Obama screwed it?

384
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,320
Well, Obama might not have been able to do that

385
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,280
if he had had massively more support than he did

386
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:01,280
versus, whereas Trump, a thought that I have is,

387
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,080
you said Trump is running on the thing

388
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,520
of being a billionaire, et cetera,

389
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,760
or a very wealthy man who can make business deals,

390
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,360
he was also running on pure hate, right?

391
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,640
Just like powering of there are people out there

392
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,480
who are trying to screw you,

393
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,560
there's people coming over the border,

394
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,200
there's people you hate, I'm gonna take vengeance on them.

395
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,920
And so part of what I wondered is like,

396
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,800
is that not currently in where we are in American politics,

397
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,040
maybe just more powerful?

398
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,560
Is there more support for that than for socialism

399
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,440
and what Bernie and folks like you are asking folks to support?

400
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,600
So I think it's worth keeping in mind,

401
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,880
well, first of all, let's concede.

402
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,000
My view is that Bernie lost the election

403
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,720
and he lost because in 2016, he wasn't recognizable,

404
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,040
he wasn't considered credible

405
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,720
until all of a sudden his message resonated

406
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,420
by then it was almost too late.

407
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,720
So I think if he had started with his momentum

408
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,480
against Clinton earlier,

409
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,560
I think he would have credibly won.

410
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,140
There was nothing the DNC could have done to stop him.

411
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,160
He just got out of the gate a little bit slow

412
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,960
in part because this was always meant

413
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,840
to be something of a protest candidacy.

414
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,920
And I think he was surprised by how seriously he took you.

415
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,240
So he went.

416
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,280
If his 2016 campaign had been his second campaign,

417
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,560
not his first, things might have been different.

418
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,640
Yeah, and I think in his second campaign,

419
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,880
I think by then the democratic field was just broken up

420
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,680
into so many different camps.

421
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,120
And it just happened to be that the Bernie camp

422
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,920
was the largest of these many polarized camps.

423
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,320
But the Democrats had something that Obama,

424
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,400
that the Republicans didn't have,

425
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,680
which is a big unifying figure

426
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,900
that could unite the other camps.

427
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,880
And ultimately it wasn't just a backdoor deal

428
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,200
that Obama cut, it was a deal connected

429
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
to various constituencies.

430
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,320
And I think for a lot of let's say black voters,

431
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,040
particularly older black voters in the South

432
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,200
and South Carolina, they voted for Biden

433
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,440
because their primary goal was to find someone

434
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,560
who they thought was electable

435
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,040
and find someone who they thought could be Trump.

436
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,920
And I think the rational kernel of it is

437
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,600
not that Biden's policies would have been better

438
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,800
in a vacuum from Bernie's policies,

439
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,000
but that Biden was electable

440
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,360
and they would bear the brunt of another Trump presidency.

441
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,680
So in that case, it's a bunch of different actors

442
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,480
acting pretty rationally.

443
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,480
And I was a Bernie national surrogate in 2020.

444
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,560
I chalk it up as just losing, losing the game of politics.

445
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,480
And if it was a backroom way for the burning crats to win,

446
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,960
I would have loved to pursue that backroom way.

447
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,120
Yeah, that's politics is making the phone calls,

448
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,840
knowing the people, knowing, hey, this person,

449
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,280
we have to gotta get this person

450
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,720
and their constituency on our side.

451
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,080
Like you can't wish that away.

452
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,080
You have to sort of win that process to some degree.

453
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,640
So I mean, do you think that, sorry, please go on.

454
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,000
No, but as far as your question on,

455
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,400
is there a stronger constituency for hate in the US

456
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,640
or for Trump's sort of vitriolic appeals

457
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,360
and for the Bernie appeals?

458
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,000
I would say that when it comes to redistribution,

459
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,520
yeah, it might be a watch.

460
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,320
There might be a lot of half the country hoping

461
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,120
for more redistribution in the abstract,

462
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,600
half the country still bed into they're gonna strike it rich.

463
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,320
So maybe let's hold off this redistribution stuff.

464
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,800
I know I'm way behind on my mortgage and I'm in medical bed,

465
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,120
but I'm one good move away from being wealthy.

466
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,880
Of course, there's some aspect of that.

467
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,640
When you compare America to, let's say Western Europe,

468
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,560
I think you would find that Americans are,

469
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,600
one, more welcoming of immigrants

470
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
in a lot of countries in Western Europe.

471
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,680
So Americans, for example,

472
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,040
even a lot of people who vote for Trump,

473
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,120
one, they vastly overestimate the amount of

474
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,840
undocumented immigration the United States has,

475
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,000
but more generally,

476
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,600
therefore higher amounts of legal immigration

477
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,280
and therefore tightening the border at the same time.

478
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,040
So which is very different than some

479
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,720
of these xenophobic appeals in Europe.

480
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,360
A vast majority of Americans are for things

481
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,680
like birthright citizenship.

482
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,160
My parents came to the US in 1988.

483
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,080
I was born in 1989.

484
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,160
I would imagine that maybe not as commanding

485
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,560
of a majority as it was in the past,

486
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,680
but probably a majority of Republicans

487
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,880
would agree that I have a right to be a US citizen.

488
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,520
That's not the case in a lot of European countries.

489
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,240
Most of those countries don't have birthright citizenship

490
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,680
like we have throughout most of the Western hemisphere.

491
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,880
On a host of other issues,

492
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,400
I think you'll find that Americans as a whole,

493
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,080
especially young people, hold more progressive views

494
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,920
than their peers in the advanced capitalist world

495
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,520
in Europe and even Japan, South Korea.

496
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,120
This is a good starting point for us

497
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,840
from progressive politics.

498
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,320
And I think that we shouldn't let Trump's appeal

499
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,760
maybe make us too pessimistic

500
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,920
about where most Americans are on these issues.

501
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,840
Yeah, I agree because and I think

502
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
that is what makes this contrast so interesting to me

503
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,600
is that you feel the groundswell of support for these issues.

504
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,160
I mean, it's literally just here on YouTube

505
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,840
when I put in the title of something,

506
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,760
Billionaires Capitalism, right?

507
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,880
I get more views when I do that, right?

508
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,040
Because the audience is like, oh my God,

509
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
yes, someone is saying the thing that I wanna hear, right?

510
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,880
Like I can tell that there's an undercurrent.

511
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,040
I guess my job sort of as a comedian and broadcaster

512
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,200
to know how people are feeling

513
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,920
and to make things that speak to that

514
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,800
that also line up with what I personally believe,

515
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,880
I can sense that undercurrent as can so many other people

516
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,040
and the contrast between it

517
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,640
and the electoral success is like somewhat fascinating.

518
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,240
You see all these positive signs,

519
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,440
but you also see, well, hold on a second,

520
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,040
why aren't politicians who espouse

521
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,840
some of these policies doing better?

522
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,480
But before we get deeper into that, I'd love actually,

523
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,760
I think we waited a little too long

524
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,640
in the podcast to do this.

525
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,480
When you talk about socialism and democratic socialism,

526
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,640
do you have a capsule summary of what you mean by that?

527
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,680
Because I don't want to, you know,

528
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,880
people are maybe feeling in the blank

529
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,040
of what they believe that your political beliefs

530
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,800
or project is.

531
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,200
Well, fundamentally to me, socialism is about

532
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,120
at a minimum securing people's social

533
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,280
and economic necessities and saying that people

534
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,040
are entitled to certain things just by virtue of being born.

535
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,600
So at the very least, that means the state

536
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,600
as a provider of last resort for things like healthcare,

537
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,480
childcare, housing, you know, nutrition.

538
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,880
So they're making sure we have that baseline

539
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,120
of a welfare state.

540
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,000
Secondly, to me, it's about extended democracy

541
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,160
from purely the formal political realm

542
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,920
into the economic realm as well.

543
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,280
So if we were to agree that democracy is a good thing

544
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,640
at the ballot box, why shouldn't we have greater degrees

545
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,600
of democracy at our workplace?

546
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,800
And within those two broad sets of principles,

547
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,040
I think you could have a lot of different forms.

548
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,040
So I don't suppose that a centrally planned economy

549
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,720
would be a great system to live under.

550
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,080
You know, I think there's certain both incentive

551
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,080
and informational problems that arise in those systems.

552
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,760
Yeah.

553
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,080
But you could still have markets

554
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,160
where you have an employee owned

555
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,360
or worker owners controlling their workplaces

556
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,240
and competing with each other to produce goods and services

557
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,960
and a private sector for consumer goods and services

558
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,680
while also having a larger state sector

559
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,320
that secures things like healthcare

560
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,040
or some of the big, what economists would call

561
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,440
natural monopolies like our, you know,

562
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,200
railroad network or things like that

563
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,280
where we feel like maybe it would be fine for there

564
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,720
to just be one actor in the sphere.

565
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,920
And we'd rather not be a giant corporate actor.

566
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,720
We'd rather have the state where in theory

567
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,040
we have greater scope to control the realm of state action.

568
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,800
So as a democratic socialist, part of what I believe in

569
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,800
is in a sense a reconciliation of liberalism and socialism.

570
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,640
So for example, I think rights are great.

571
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,360
And it's great to have this idea that yes, democracy

572
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,520
is excellent in most spheres of life,

573
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,960
but there are certain things where I don't want my neighbor

574
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,840
intruding on my personal consumption choice.

575
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,680
I don't want my neighbor or the majority restricting

576
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,160
on my ability to speak freely or to do my own thing.

577
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,120
And I think those are great aspects of liberalism.

578
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,320
And I think they're perfectly reconcilable

579
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,440
with a socialism that tries to secure people's rights

580
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,440
to develop into individuals that can truly,

581
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,920
you know, reach their potentials

582
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,920
and can participate in this, in our society.

583
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,440
Because, you know, right now I think we take for granted

584
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,360
as Americans that a kid born in, you know,

585
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,640
Fairfield, Connecticut is going to have a radically different

586
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,800
life and life outcomes and opportunities as a kid born,

587
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,920
you know, 20, 30 miles away and in Hartford or Waterbury.

588
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,120
And I'm doing very Connecticut example.

589
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,600
Oh, everybody is aware of the socioeconomic strata

590
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,920
of different Connecticut cities and towns.

591
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,440
I think we all know this.

592
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,280
No, I know what you're talking about.

593
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,080
You're talking about like where I grew up on Long Island

594
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,400
versus Brownsville, Brooklyn, right?

595
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,280
Or pick your neighborhood where you're like,

596
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,840
oh, yeah, that's the bad part of town.

597
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,440
And this is the good part of town, right?

598
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,080
We just take for granted that, you know,

599
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,520
some kids going to public schools in some neighborhoods,

600
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,880
we're not even like Britain where, yeah, of course,

601
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,280
we ship people out to fancy boarding schools

602
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,400
are going to have different outcomes.

603
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,680
But public schools, we take for granted

604
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,640
that some of them are going to produce doctors

605
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,680
and lawyers and engineers and other schools

606
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,640
are going to produce dropouts.

607
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,000
And that's not normal for a rich country

608
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,200
where we could easily solve that problem, not even

609
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,480
through socialist revolution, but through tax and transfers

610
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,640
and investments and jobs programs

611
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,200
and a host of other things.

612
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,160
Yeah, I thought your answer was interesting there

613
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,440
because you sort of gave us the entire scope all the way

614
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,600
from the minimal to the maximal version of socialism.

615
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,080
You ended by talking about a substantially different economic

616
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,040
system that has a lot more state action,

617
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,680
worker cooperatives that are competing with each other.

618
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,520
We could dive into that.

619
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,320
But you also had, on the other hand,

620
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,320
talking about simply expanded social welfare programs

621
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,960
of the kind that we're already used to.

622
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,560
Like we already provide in America

623
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,400
many of the types of programs that you're talking about.

624
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,720
We have a somewhat socialized version of education.

625
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,320
We have public school K through 12.

626
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,280
We do not have that for higher education.

627
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,440
And we could talk about ways that we

628
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,960
could expand that for public education

629
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,000
so that your zip code does not determine how much,

630
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,920
that we don't fund public schools via property taxes,

631
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,480
meaning wealthier areas have better schools.

632
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,200
And what I find really interesting

633
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,480
is that in the last couple of years,

634
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,520
we have tested a lot of the most immediate socialist ideas

635
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,800
if we want to label them that way.

636
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:02,640
During the pandemic, there was massively increased welfare

637
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,480
payment or welfare payments of general kinds

638
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,200
to folks during the pandemic.

639
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,480
We had expanded tax credits, child welfare, et cetera,

640
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,520
unemployment benefits.

641
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,960
And those had huge beneficial impacts on people's lives

642
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,200
that then a couple of years later were removed.

643
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,560
Also, going back to the 2020 election,

644
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,720
when Joe Biden came into office,

645
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,040
he at least acted as though he was going to be much more of a,

646
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,240
I don't want to say a socialist,

647
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,360
but he was proclaiming himself sort

648
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,080
of the next coming of FDR, right?

649
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,920
He was going to do New Deal-style stuff.

650
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,560
And he did some of it, giant infrastructure spending,

651
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,600
et cetera, antitrust enforcement.

652
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,080
Those were all things that I expected an Elizabeth Warren

653
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,880
or a Bernie Sanders president to do, not a Joe Biden.

654
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,000
And so it feels on the policy level, holy shit,

655
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,320
some of these things have become not impossible in America,

656
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,560
even if we're not sure if they're going to stick around.

657
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,720
Do you have any view on that?

658
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,400
Yeah, I think that one interesting, first of all,

659
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,840
I think that the infrastructure bill

660
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,800
was a positive development.

661
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,640
It was over a trillion dollars of funding

662
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,920
for Roadsbridge's mass transit rail service.

663
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,320
Obviously, that's better than what

664
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,520
we would have gotten from a Trump administration.

665
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:26,320
Obviously, it's a policy success.

666
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,640
But I guess that sometimes the United States,

667
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,720
the reason why a lot of Americans feel like, oh, well,

668
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,320
we're already trying massive socialist-style spending

669
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,800
in the US, and we already have this massive welfare state,

670
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,760
but it just doesn't work, is because we tend

671
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,680
to have quite inefficiently designed programs.

672
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,040
When we do spend money on welfare,

673
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,160
we needlessly mean-tested, and we waste time and resources,

674
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,320
and we weaken these programs by saying,

675
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,040
you have to be this poor to use it.

676
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,720
Not only that, it does create real incentives

677
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,960
and disincentives, and it creates resentment towards,

678
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,640
let's say if you want to use this category,

679
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,120
it's kind of a made-up category, but the lower middle class

680
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,720
feels like, oh, well, I'm struggling,

681
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,680
or the working poor feels like I'm struggling,

682
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,200
but I don't qualify for something that I qualify for

683
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,880
if I just worked a little bit less,

684
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,680
and you end up dividing up working-class people

685
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,040
that have invested interest in protecting

686
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,240
a lot of the same programs, and those people who

687
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,120
might be working and might not qualify, for example,

688
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,080
for Medicaid would benefit from living in a community,

689
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
because they already live in these areas,

690
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,280
with their neighbors who are able to access

691
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,360
good health care and things like that.

692
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,360
So it's both the design of the programs isn't great,

693
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,240
and often we tend to create programs

694
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,520
where we allow corporations to push prices sky-high

695
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,240
for certain things like health care,

696
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,800
and our solution to the problem is by subsidizing the poorest

697
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,360
so they're able to access this market,

698
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,600
but we're doing nothing to address the cost of things.

699
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,160
So with education, we're doing this, higher education,

700
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,800
and with health care, whereas in other more

701
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,040
state-ified systems, you're able to find ways

702
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,840
to more radically reduce cost, and that's

703
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,960
a reason why we spend a larger percentage of our GDP

704
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,520
on health care than other countries like even the UK,

705
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,720
which has a system more expensive than Medicare

706
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,840
for all our main demand of the United States,

707
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,080
but an entire national health service.

708
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,160
So I often think that even things that the bill back better

709
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,920
kind of would emerge out of it, and would actually

710
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,160
get passed the infrastructure bill,

711
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,120
I question the design of some of those things.

712
00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:00,000
Are we just subsidizing willy-nilly a lot of green companies?

713
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,560
Sure.

714
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,320
I'd rather subsidize them than other forms of capital,

715
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,360
but are we actually controlling the outcomes of these subsidies

716
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,160
or are we just throwing money at things?

717
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,880
Right.

718
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,440
Are we just giving money to more corporations

719
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,040
that we like maybe a little bit better,

720
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,360
but we're not getting at the root of the problem?

721
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,160
Hey, everybody.

722
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,920
I know we're in the ad break, but we're doing something

723
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,000
a little bit different today.

724
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,600
Today, I'm going to tell you about an amazing group of people

725
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,920
who did not pay us anything to be a part of the show.

726
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,640
We just think they do amazing work,

727
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,720
and we wanted you to know about them.

728
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,600
You might remember back in 2018, those heart-wrenching stories

729
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,720
of families torn apart by border patrol, refugee children

730
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,200
being pulled away from their parents

731
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,880
who were in turn deported to their home countries.

732
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,680
It was devastating then, and it's just as devastating now,

733
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,160
with hundreds of families still not reunited

734
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,680
after all these years.

735
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,360
You know, we discuss so many problems on factually,

736
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,920
but I firmly believe that there is always something

737
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,720
that can be done about those problems.

738
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,120
And recently, I came across an organization

739
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,800
called All Otrolado, which works to reunify families.

740
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,400
They provide holistic legal and humanitarian support

741
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,600
to refugees, deportees, and other migrants

742
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,200
in the US and Tijuana through a multidisciplinary,

743
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,200
client-centered, harm reduction-based practice.

744
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,480
Since 2018, they have successfully brought together

745
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,000
over 100 families torn apart by Trump's

746
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,720
zero-tolerance policy.

747
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,360
But reuniting those families is just the beginning.

748
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,640
All Otrolado continues to support each family

749
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,800
with legal aid, housing, and counseling

750
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,840
to help heal and get back on their feet.

751
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,760
I mean, can you imagine the agony

752
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,480
of having your child ripped from your arms,

753
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,760
unsure of when you'll see them again?

754
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,280
We cannot allow such family separations to continue,

755
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,000
so if you're like me and believe

756
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,640
that all families belong together,

757
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,200
then join me in supporting All Otrolado and Donate Today.

758
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,160
You can find the link to Donate to All Otrolado

759
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,800
in the description of this episode

760
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,560
or go to gum.fm slash charity and Donate Today.

761
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,880
You can also consider volunteering with the organization

762
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,000
which offers opportunities

763
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,080
that are both in-person and virtual.

764
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,320
The best way to get involved

765
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,440
is by filling out an application on their website

766
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,640
at allotrolado.org slash volunteer.

767
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,680
Thank you so much.

768
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,040
Folks, today's sponsor is one

769
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,720
I cannot recommend highly enough, Delete Me.

770
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,840
As a factually listener,

771
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840
you know how much I value online privacy.

772
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,840
Well, Delete Me has been an indispensable tool for me

773
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,680
for many years.

774
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,120
I've been using them long before

775
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,400
they even started advertising on this show.

776
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,520
This day and age, it is shockingly simple

777
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,720
for data brokers to peddle your personal information

778
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,840
without your consent.

779
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,520
These data brokers may be selling your name,

780
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,720
phone number, and home address,

781
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,160
and you might never even know it's happening.

782
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,720
Trying to locate and remove all this data yourself

783
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,520
can feel like an impossible task,

784
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,600
but that is where Delete Me shines.

785
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,120
Their team of experts tirelessly scour the web

786
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,960
to track down and wipe out your personal data.

787
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,880
In just seven days,

788
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,280
you will receive a detailed report of their findings

789
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,120
and believe it or not,

790
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,280
a whopping 41% of Americans

791
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,160
are vulnerable to online harassment

792
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,040
from doxing to scams and even identity theft.

793
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,120
In some cases, having your info online

794
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,400
can turn cyber stalking

795
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,080
into good old fashioned in-person stalking.

796
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,880
Protect yourself from these threats with Delete Me.

797
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,720
So if you're like me

798
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,280
and you value your personal privacy,

799
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,840
I wanna make sure that your identifying personal details

800
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,160
are not floating around the internet

801
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,520
where anybody can buy them.

802
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,160
Well, you can get 20% off your Delete Me plan

803
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,680
when you go to joindeleteme.com slash adam

804
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,000
and use promo code adam at checkout.

805
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,240
That's joindeleteme.com slash adam, code adam.

806
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,400
I wholeheartedly recommend this service.

807
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,560
Check out Delete Me.

808
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,400
Folks, you know,

809
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,360
I am all about those little pick-me-ups throughout the day.

810
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,800
Whether it's tackling work tasks

811
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,360
or conquering chores around the house,

812
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,120
treating myself is a must.

813
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,120
And you know what gets me smiling every time?

814
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,240
Japanese snacks.

815
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,960
Not only are they bursting with flavor,

816
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,800
but their cute packaging and quirky vibes

817
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,560
add an extra layer of fun.

818
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,280
That is why teaming up with Bokksu,

819
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,000
a Japanese snack subscription box

820
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,680
has been such an absolute delight

821
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,800
because these are not just

822
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,600
your run-of-the-mill grocery store snacks.

823
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,760
Each month, Bokksu brings you over 20 unique treats

824
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,200
that you can normally find only in Japan.

825
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,720
Plus, they throw in a nifty guide packed with info

826
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,080
about each snack and Japanese culture.

827
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,400
Snacking while learning?

828
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,240
Are you kidding?

829
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,320
It's like this was literally made for me.

830
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,920
Oh, and each box ships free from Japan straight to your door.

831
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,400
I happen to have a box right here

832
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,320
and let me tell you something.

833
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,720
I loved the first box they sent so much.

834
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,640
I told our ad people,

835
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,720
please make sure that Bokksu re-ups

836
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,280
because I gotta get another box of these snacks.

837
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,600
First of all, check out this incredible guide here

838
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,280
full of beautiful photos.

839
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,880
It tells you about all the different snacks.

840
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,280
You know, my girlfriend's gluten-free

841
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,480
so we can find one in here

842
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,920
that makes sure it works for her dietary restrictions.

843
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,040
So, but she's not here right now.

844
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,200
So I'm gonna make sure I eat one of the gluten-y ones.

845
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,040
Ooh, 20th century pear biscuit.

846
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,200
This delicate biscuit is a luxurious blend

847
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,760
of 20th century Asian pear rich cheese

848
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,600
and decadent white chocolate.

849
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,720
Oh, it contains wheat so that means I should eat it.

850
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
All right, let me find it here.

851
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,680
20th century pear biscuit.

852
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,000
Okay, here we go, found it.

853
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,720
20th century pear biscuit.

854
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,840
Cute little packaging, let me give it a try.

855
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,760
Oh my gosh.

856
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,600
That is so good.

857
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,120
Oh, the pear flavor is really strong.

858
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,960
Mm, it's like a strong aroma.

859
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,240
Next to this crunchy biscuit,

860
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,320
the textural contrast is really wonderful.

861
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,240
I mean, that is so good.

862
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,080
And guess what?

863
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,400
There are 19 other different snacks in here for me to try.

864
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,760
I love this service so much.

865
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,640
And you know why?

866
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,720
My favorite thing about it is that they support

867
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,000
small family-run businesses in Japan.

868
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,640
Bokksu has sourced these treats

869
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,800
by working with over 245 small makers in Japan,

870
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,160
helping out their businesses

871
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,920
and helping to preserve their traditions.

872
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,960
So if you love Japanese snacks as much as I do

873
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,000
and if you wanna try snacks

874
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
that you literally cannot get anywhere else

875
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,840
outside of going to Japan yourself,

876
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,600
you have gotta try out Bokksu.

877
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Right now, you can use the code FACTUALLY

878
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,920
for $15 off your first order on bokksu.com.

879
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,480
That's code FACTUALLY for $15 off your first order

880
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,560
on bokksu.com.

881
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,400
Tell them Adam sent you

882
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,160
and now I gotta finish these snacks.

883
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,000
Oh man, that's really good.

884
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,120
I'm glad she's gluten-free, so I could eat this one.

885
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,760
Staying on healthcare for a second,

886
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,720
so much, so many times when we describe,

887
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,400
hey, here's what they do in Europe.

888
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,840
Here's how they organize a system

889
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,440
or here's how we could tweak our current subsidies

890
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,720
to make them better, et cetera.

891
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,680
We're talking about improvements

892
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,600
that just in literal fact would be better, right?

893
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,240
Like when we talk about the American healthcare system,

894
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,080
we can go down this list of it's so expensive,

895
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,120
it's expensive because of multiple insurance companies

896
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,520
and because of the capitalist incentive.

897
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,360
If we had a single-payer system,

898
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,680
we would have better health outcomes,

899
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,800
everything would be cheaper

900
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,520
and this is being done around the globe.

901
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,640
It's sort of like incontrovertibly better in every way

902
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,920
and yet in the United States,

903
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,160
what is, you know, should almost be,

904
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,760
hey, there's an asteroid headed towards Earth,

905
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,960
let's look at it, it's up there,

906
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,240
this is real, you know, we know this for a fact,

907
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,360
becomes a political position that, you know,

908
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,080
rises and falls in popularity

909
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,760
and you know, I'll say right now, Medicare for All,

910
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,560
that is the socialist and the sort of birdie movement ask.

911
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,000
It's also sort of faded in popularity again in our politics.

912
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,200
It is less a part of our politics than it was five years ago.

913
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,920
And so it's such a strange state of affairs

914
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,560
that again, you know, a single-payer system,

915
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,000
better in every way, anyone who dives into the data,

916
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,560
it's very hard to argue that it wouldn't be.

917
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,000
It's very hard to defend the current system

918
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,760
and yet it seems so far from us being able to implement

919
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,840
what's like truly a common sense reform.

920
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,160
Why do you think that is

921
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
and what do you think the prospects are

922
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,000
in the future for that kind of program?

923
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,880
Well, I think in this case, what's interesting is

924
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
you have a chunk of the American public

925
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,920
that is already covered under a single-payer system,

926
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,640
be it retirees and also the poor,

927
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,400
and veterans as well who are covered through the VA

928
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,080
in an underfunded system,

929
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,720
but a system that's closer to the British NHS

930
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,400
than anything else.

931
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,000
So that chunk of Americans

932
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,480
are already covered by socialized medicine.

933
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,040
Then you have a chunk of Americans

934
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,360
who have stable jobs,

935
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,120
either they're lucky enough to have the old union jobs

936
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,040
and be a part of that 10% of the economy

937
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,520
that's covered under union contracts

938
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,440
or their manager or professionals

939
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,440
or others who have stable healthcare.

940
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,600
So then you have to kind of go down the list

941
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,560
until you find people who are getting really squeezed

942
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,760
by the current system.

943
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,920
Now, the new system would be better for a lot of people.

944
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,920
If we retain current spending for Medicaid and Medicare,

945
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,440
then in a system where we're better able to control costs,

946
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,200
we could actually provide more services

947
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,360
under Medicare, Medicaid.

948
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:42,360
If we had employers no longer responsible for healthcare,

949
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,360
then workers in America would be able

950
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,120
to use that extra bargaining power to demand

951
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,240
not just the platinum healthcare benefits

952
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,840
or their employers to pay for their HRAs

953
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,000
or these other tax-affirmed programs

954
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,920
like FSAs and HSAs.

955
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,040
If anyone's listened to this from the UK,

956
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,800
they probably just think we're insane with these acronyms,

957
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,880
but this is how complicated our system is,

958
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,680
but they'd be able to use that bargaining power

959
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,000
that's often spent by unions

960
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,160
talking about these private market benefit schemes

961
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,360
and actually use it towards wages or hours worked

962
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,360
or conditions or something more bread and butter.

963
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,600
So a lot of people would benefit from the new system,

964
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
but if they feel like they're getting enough

965
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,520
from the current system,

966
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,240
and if they're also in a perverse way,

967
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,840
maybe benefiting from the fact

968
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,360
that there's 20, 25 million people

969
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,960
who are essentially either not insured

970
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,680
or who are unable to access their benefits

971
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,000
because of how high the deductibles are,

972
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,920
they have the advantage of having,

973
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,920
let's say shorter wait times than in other systems.

974
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,560
It doesn't really equal that

975
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,400
because in practice,

976
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,400
you'd always encourage more doctors to join

977
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,560
and if people are worried about,

978
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,960
oh, in single payer systems,

979
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,800
you could see your primary care position right away,

980
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,080
but if you want to see a specialist that's sometimes longer

981
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,280
or sometimes the state kind of does its own triage

982
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,520
if you really need to see a specialist,

983
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,680
you'll see one tomorrow,

984
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,040
but if you need to see a dermatologist

985
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,560
for a cosmetic skin condition,

986
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,360
then you might have to wait three, four weeks.

987
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,240
That sort of thing.

988
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,320
You could just pay specialists more in the system.

989
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,800
You could find ways to fix this,

990
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,040
but I think that the constituency

991
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,360
that really is materially motivated to go out there

992
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:48,360
and to change US healthcare is actually not that massive

993
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,120
unless we have a politician,

994
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,160
a movement articulating the benefits

995
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,920
in a clear and concise way like Bernie did.

996
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,520
The entire Bernie campaign,

997
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,360
many of the people I know doing work around Medicare for all

998
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:07,360
were already insured by good employer-sponsored plans.

999
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,960
So it wasn't just self-interest.

1000
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,520
I think it was about tying it to a broader vision of change

1001
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,440
and taking on a really powerful forces,

1002
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,360
that the medical industry.

1003
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,400
Well, it's not just the medical industry though,

1004
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,440
it's also like a lot of the public

1005
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,520
has a vested interest in the current system.

1006
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,120
You mentioned unions which would not have,

1007
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,600
unions in the United States generally bargain for healthcare

1008
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,920
and they have to spend maybe one out of every three

1009
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,760
cycles.

1010
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,280
We got to make sure we shore up our health insurance plan.

1011
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,160
We got to make sure the plan is really good.

1012
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,960
And hey, if there was a state-sponsored health insurance,

1013
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,400
they wouldn't have to do so, right?

1014
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,080
They could just focus on wages instead.

1015
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,680
That argument's true and yet many unions

1016
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,240
have not supported Medicare for all

1017
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,880
because the members think,

1018
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,160
well, hold on a second, I have great healthcare now,

1019
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,720
I don't know what this plan would be like,

1020
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,680
maybe it would be worse.

1021
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,440
A, there's a huge education hurdle,

1022
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,520
but then also sometimes the leadership of the unions

1023
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,160
is like, well, healthcare is what we provide.

1024
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,080
Like that is why people are excited to be a member

1025
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,920
of the union is because they get the healthcare.

1026
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,760
So if we don't give healthcare,

1027
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,480
how do we know that we can get our members to show up

1028
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,720
if we need to go on strike, et cetera?

1029
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,560
Maybe they won't need us as much anymore.

1030
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,360
And so those are, and by the way,

1031
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,440
those are ways that good people in good faith

1032
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,000
in the movement can end up,

1033
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,680
the incentives push them in that direction.

1034
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,480
And so it seems like there's still,

1035
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,440
even though it all pencils outright,

1036
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,200
there are sort of institutional barriers,

1037
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,720
even in folks who, you would think that as a socialist,

1038
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,920
you would be in the movement with,

1039
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,520
with folks in the labor movement.

1040
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,320
It's like an internal tension there.

1041
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,680
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

1042
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,400
I think that there's a lot of unions

1043
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,880
who basically don't trust the government

1044
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,880
to create a plan as good as what their members enjoy now,

1045
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,240
or at least they feel like the union members

1046
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,960
feel that way in the private sector.

1047
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,160
And there's also some other unions that are afraid

1048
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,440
that if there's a continued push

1049
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,880
to make union membership volunteer,

1050
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,400
so kind of open shops instead of closed shops,

1051
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,240
that having kind of access to health insurance

1052
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,040
and people get accessing those plans

1053
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,720
through their union membership

1054
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,160
is a potentially really important part

1055
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,000
of keeping people in unions.

1056
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,840
But I think these are ultimately pretty short-sighted.

1057
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,680
I also think it's short-sighted for US industry

1058
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,640
as a whole, particularly, let's say the US auto industry

1059
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,320
that's competing with, historically competing with

1060
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,280
labor in Japan and in Germany,

1061
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,320
places that the state plays a much bigger role

1062
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,560
in health provision, but are, you know,

1063
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,000
kind of at a competitive disadvantage.

1064
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I think the counter is that employers

1065
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,320
like having this major benefit

1066
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,920
that everybody needs tied to employment

1067
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,440
because it keeps people at their firms.

1068
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,280
And again, they make the calculation

1069
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,280
that it may be the control that they get over workers

1070
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,320
and this leverage is more important than the savings.

1071
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,800
But I think there's a host of small businesses

1072
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,800
and others that would benefit from not having this burden.

1073
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,280
Yeah, I mean, I think you're right that it's short-sighted.

1074
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,280
It's a sort of short-term or current benefit

1075
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,520
that some of these actors currently enjoy,

1076
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,520
but that is preventing them from a greater long-term benefit.

1077
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,360
And yeah, I'm just curious from your view,

1078
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,960
how do we make progress on it?

1079
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,320
You said, you know, it sort of needs a leader

1080
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,960
like Bernie spreading the message,

1081
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,600
but Bernie did the best job of it,

1082
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,200
anyone's done in 30 years.

1083
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,160
And, you know, again, you know, the wave rolled in,

1084
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,840
but then went back.

1085
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,520
And so are there, you know, in terms of this,

1086
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,280
just looking at socialized medicine,

1087
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,520
how does one build progress towards that

1088
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,760
over the next few decades?

1089
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,520
So the reason why I keep mentioning Bernie

1090
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,560
as someone who's obviously my politics

1091
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,840
are probably a step or two to Bernie's left in certain ways.

1092
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,680
And I was a member of Socialist Movement

1093
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,000
way before the first Bernie campaign in 2015, 2016.

1094
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,480
But I keep mentioning him because I think

1095
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,080
that we're in such a hollowed-out political environment

1096
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,720
that we actually need big national politics

1097
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,760
and politics at the level of communications

1098
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,400
and politics at the level of almost like

1099
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,120
a national kind of populist articulation,

1100
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,120
the way that Trump provides it on the right.

1101
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,120
And I think Bernie for a time was providing on the left

1102
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,080
to break through this hollowed-out environment,

1103
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,440
to break through and to re-engage people with politics.

1104
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,920
So in the 2016 campaign,

1105
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,000
you saw for the first time Trump and Bernie both

1106
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,480
rallying people by the tens of thousands.

1107
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,600
Yeah, it was displays that,

1108
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,080
obviously there was a little bit of this in Obama's 2008 run,

1109
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,960
but it's something that reminds you of politics

1110
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,000
in another country, not politics,

1111
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,240
as we've known it growing up in the United States.

1112
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,840
Yeah, arena rallies for political candidates.

1113
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,640
That's not something that people were doing for Al Gore.

1114
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,560
Definitely, it would be like a once a year,

1115
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,040
they'll just do it at the DNC.

1116
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,280
You remember he did the weird thing

1117
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,000
where he kind of rebuffed Bill Clinton a little bit

1118
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,120
and aggressively made out with his wife, Al Gore.

1119
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
I don't remember that,

1120
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,960
but I'm gonna look it up after this show.

1121
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,440
It was kind of a like, I'm Al Gore and I live my wife.

1122
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,840
You know, that guy doesn't love his wife.

1123
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,080
I'm a wife guy.

1124
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,360
Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

1125
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,280
So, you know, I think that in this environment

1126
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,160
that's so hollowed out,

1127
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,360
one, it means that even a group as small

1128
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,840
as Democratic Socialist America or other small groups

1129
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,480
like Justice Democrats or Sunrise

1130
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,360
can actually make a difference because,

1131
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,160
and on the other side,

1132
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,280
obviously the anti-abortion activists

1133
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,120
and the Christian right

1134
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,920
can kind of make a huge difference too.

1135
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,000
With a small group of highly motivated organizers

1136
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,560
in a hollowed out political environment

1137
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,560
can have disproportionate influence.

1138
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,000
But I think that the goal of campaigns

1139
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,040
like the Sanders campaign has to be

1140
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,960
to spur people out of this malaise,

1141
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,160
then get them motivated and activated

1142
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,600
and give them a language that they could use,

1143
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,680
a framework that they could use,

1144
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,040
a set of demands that they can identify with.

1145
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,040
Where Bernie failed was that he wasn't successfully able

1146
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:57,760
to carry on his campaign even in a limited form

1147
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,240
through some permanent organ.

1148
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,400
So in other words, he tried to do our revolution

1149
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,440
which kind of went nowhere

1150
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,000
and he tried to do these other efforts

1151
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,480
to make his campaign permanent.

1152
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,760
But that's not something he was particularly good at.

1153
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,280
So it was up to us on the far left

1154
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,920
to build organizations like the Democratic Social for America.

1155
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,360
Whereas I think that socials politics in America

1156
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,520
is obviously what I believe in, I think it's important.

1157
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,960
But I think there's probably a broader base

1158
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,440
of for egalitarian, pro-working class politics in America

1159
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,080
that uses probably is more ideologically diffuse

1160
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,780
and also uses a different sort of language

1161
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,600
than the socials left does in the United States.

1162
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,160
But that fundamentally stands for a fairer deal

1163
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,840
for working class people and stands for defense

1164
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,480
and expansion of important social programs

1165
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,440
like Medicare for all.

1166
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,800
When you say a different sort of language

1167
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,080
than the socialists left,

1168
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,080
what do you mean than the current socialists left?

1169
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,880
Well, I think the socialists left right now,

1170
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,720
we are activists but without a huge social base.

1171
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,360
So a lot of us come from working class backgrounds

1172
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,560
and a lot of us are involved in campaigns

1173
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,000
that do connect with a lot of working class people.

1174
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,380
Like for example, there's a lot of DSA members

1175
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,920
who are actively involved in tenant rights struggles

1176
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,360
that do have an important base.

1177
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,360
But fundamentally we join DSA in ones and twos.

1178
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,960
So we often create a hot house

1179
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,700
where certain language and ideological distinctions

1180
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,620
that are not really that important or consequential

1181
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:45,660
to people's lives day to day take on greater consequence.

1182
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,140
Right.

1183
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,740
A lot of people reading books

1184
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,500
and getting very heated about them in closed door meetings

1185
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,820
is what you're talking about.

1186
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:56,380
Yeah, I wish the meetings were closed doors.

1187
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:00,140
So sometimes they go viral, yeah.

1188
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,780
The interesting arguments, yeah.

1189
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,180
And again, I think building a base of cadre

1190
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:12,180
to think about some of these more theoretical points

1191
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,380
or are committed or keep alive some of this whole language.

1192
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,100
I actually think it's useful in certain ways.

1193
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:22,060
But if you're not connected to a real social base,

1194
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,020
you're not challenged to try to articulate your ideas

1195
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,140
in a way every single day,

1196
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,940
in a way that wins over ordinary Americans

1197
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,420
and all their complexities.

1198
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,820
So I think that's the...

1199
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,900
Yang to Trump to back to Yang to now RFK,

1200
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,580
junior curious teamster.

1201
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,460
Like literally someone I spoke to yesterday.

1202
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,300
So...

1203
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,140
Right.

1204
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,180
And who's a person of color, by the way, which makes it...

1205
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,020
Yeah.

1206
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,420
I think that's a lot of this election

1207
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:03,420
because even a lot of our priors about Hispanic voters

1208
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,900
vis-a-vis Trump is not gonna be true in this election either.

1209
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,820
And the RFK junior factor is something

1210
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,060
that I personally just have not considered much

1211
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,100
until recently.

1212
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,940
Now it just seems like he's not gonna go away

1213
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,340
and he's gonna get his 15%

1214
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,540
and maybe I'm just hoping only eight of those 15

1215
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:22,020
will be from Biden and the rest will be from Trump.

1216
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,540
You think he's gonna get 15,

1217
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,740
you think RFK is gonna get 15% of the popular vote?

1218
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,820
I think that, well, a lot of, I think,

1219
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,580
polling would have him close to that.

1220
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,420
I think in reality, as we closer to the election,

1221
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,300
it'll become more and more polarized.

1222
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:41,300
I think that that RFK vote will dissipate back

1223
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:45,060
to both Trumps, probably 55% of it might go to Biden,

1224
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,940
the rest will go to Trump.

1225
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:51,540
And I think that the best bet,

1226
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,780
I'm one of the few people,

1227
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,740
and I feel like the few people in the world

1228
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,420
that just thinks that Biden's gonna win,

1229
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:00,260
if only because I feel like he's been hit so hard

1230
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,460
with all these negatives for so many months

1231
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,980
that it's only gonna go up from here.

1232
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,780
And Trump between his legal trouble

1233
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:11,380
and between just the sheer amount of vitriol

1234
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,620
that a portion of Americans have for him,

1235
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:17,460
I just feel like the negative polarization

1236
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,420
is people like to call it of the race.

1237
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,020
Well, we'll skew in Biden's favor

1238
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,820
because we already lived through Trump

1239
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,180
and we have, I think, concerns

1240
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:32,860
that the next four years of Trump would be even worse.

1241
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,060
And I just feel like that's the thing

1242
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,140
that'll motivate people who are quite discontent

1243
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,900
with Biden, like myself, to vote for him.

1244
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,660
And I would vote for Biden if I was in a swing state.

1245
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:48,380
I'm in New York, so I'll vote for Jill Stein or something.

1246
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,580
You know why I vote for Jill Stein?

1247
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,020
Because Jill Stein asked me,

1248
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,780
hey, Basker, are you gonna vote for me in 2016?

1249
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,780
I'm like, when?

1250
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,260
No one else hit me up.

1251
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,820
I'm not sure if it's an effective way

1252
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,660
to win a national campaign.

1253
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,700
She personally asked you.

1254
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,620
Yeah, yeah.

1255
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,820
Well, okay, but some people will say,

1256
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,820
and let's go back.

1257
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,460
Oh, actually, before I get to that,

1258
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,860
I do wanna make one point that you were talking about

1259
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:20,660
somebody who speaks to an actual group of working people

1260
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,300
that reminds you of, say, Sean Fain,

1261
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,700
who is saying a lot of those ideas,

1262
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,420
why do we even have billionaires, et cetera,

1263
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,340
things that maybe Bernie could have said,

1264
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,380
or that a DSA leader would say,

1265
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,420
but he's saying them to his actual members,

1266
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:37,780
who he understands, he knows them well,

1267
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,700
and he's trying to get them to go on strike

1268
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,820
or sign a union card or whatever it is,

1269
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,940
and that's really rooted to their struggle.

1270
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:50,940
It's not someone like myself at a DSA meeting

1271
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,580
with a college education saying,

1272
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,780
hey, here's what I think would be good

1273
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,660
for some people who I haven't met, for example,

1274
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,340
and that's a real difference that is meaningful, perhaps.

1275
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,820
Going back to the national election, though,

1276
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:08,820
you, there were people who said the same thing

1277
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,060
that you just said, I'll vote for Jill Stein

1278
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,020
because I'm pretty sure that Biden's gonna win.

1279
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,980
You did say you'd vote for him if you lived in a swing state,

1280
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,460
but there are people who said similar things in 2016,

1281
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,780
and other people are very mad at them

1282
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,940
because everyone thought Hillary Clinton was gonna win,

1283
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,980
and hey, I can just, you know,

1284
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,940
I can do whatever I want, right, for that reason.

1285
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,380
And I think this year,

1286
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,380
something that is really going to give Biden

1287
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,020
a lot of trouble is what's happening in Gaza right now,

1288
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,540
the support for Israel, et cetera,

1289
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,860
and it strikes me that this has been

1290
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,220
such a wedge through the entire left.

1291
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,340
The, you know, you had DSA members writing an open letter

1292
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,900
about why they're leaving DSA,

1293
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,260
because of, da-da-da-da-da-da, go down, you know,

1294
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,380
they wrote their DSA national leadership,

1295
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:00,780
put out a message that was, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1296
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:03,260
You've had this happen at, you know,

1297
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,980
leftist groups and meetings throughout the country

1298
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,420
in local democratic parties, et cetera.

1299
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,780
And, you know, I've heard a lot of people say,

1300
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,220
hey, this is, regardless of how you feel about that,

1301
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,060
we are talking about, you know,

1302
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,320
we're talking about America's economic needs, right,

1303
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,960
and building socialism in America.

1304
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,080
This is a, you know, maybe this is not a distraction

1305
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,000
because we are a part of what's happening in Israel,

1306
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,120
but it's a very, you know, it's such a wrench

1307
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,640
to be thrown in at such a vulnerable moment.

1308
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,200
And so I'm curious to get into that piece of it.

1309
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,720
How do you think that the, you know,

1310
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,040
Israel's offensive against the civilians in Gaza

1311
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,200
has affected your movement?

1312
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,800
Well, I think among DSA, if anything,

1313
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,560
having the focal point of solidarity work with Palestine

1314
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:01,560
has been a uniting factor in the organization as a whole.

1315
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,600
I think there's some older members who objected

1316
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,920
to some of the rhetoric used right after

1317
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,040
the October 7th attacks.

1318
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,640
And I think their argument was basically,

1319
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:16,640
you're using a rhetoric that is preemptively condemning

1320
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,880
Israel for the response rather than focusing on

1321
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,840
the actual attack in which hundreds of civilians died,

1322
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,000
and also using rhetoric in some cases

1323
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,880
that maybe it was more appropriate

1324
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,720
to national liberation movements in the 60s and 70s

1325
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,560
than it is to an Islamist group like Hamas.

1326
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:44,560
I think that obviously I try to aim for some of the,

1327
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,680
in general, try to aim for a broad-based rhetoric

1328
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,040
that tries to speak beyond the converted.

1329
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,160
So I think there's probably some truth in that

1330
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,600
and some of the initial communications.

1331
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,320
But as a whole, I think in a moral and ethical sense,

1332
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,120
I think DSA kind of got it right,

1333
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:04,360
which is that there was definitely going to be

1334
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,600
a huge and disproportionate Israeli response

1335
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,040
on a largely civilian population.

1336
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:16,040
And I think a lot of the Democratic Party,

1337
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,960
particularly younger Democrats,

1338
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,560
much less the far left, are united in thinking

1339
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,760
that Israel's actions have been disproportionate,

1340
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,040
that it's targeted civilians,

1341
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,960
and that there needs to be an immediate ceasefire.

1342
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,000
I think they were even hearing those sorts of things

1343
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,760
in tepid ways from the Biden administration itself

1344
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,600
or firm figures within the State Department,

1345
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,600
which shows a pretty wide spectrum of belief.

1346
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,280
So I do think that Biden hasn't exhibited

1347
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,560
the courage that he needed to.

1348
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,080
I think he's done just enough

1349
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:59,240
that history won't say that he was Netanyahu.

1350
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,240
And I think that's honestly been his goal.

1351
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,280
He hasn't been, he's been probably thinking himself,

1352
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,840
well, I don't want to spend enough capital to end this

1353
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,760
because the last time I spent a lot of capital

1354
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,280
on a foreign policy issue,

1355
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,840
his correct decision to withdraw from Afghanistan,

1356
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,360
I got so much flack for it,

1357
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,480
but I also don't want people to think of Netanyahu,

1358
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,720
so I'm going to do the various, the hot mic moment,

1359
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,200
which I actually do as a hot,

1360
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,760
do you think was a hot mic moment,

1361
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,880
but it might as well have been staged

1362
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,120
at the State of the Union?

1363
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,400
This is where he was like,

1364
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,840
ah, man, maybe he's got to cut that out, man,

1365
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,480
or whatever, like to somebody off the mic, yeah.

1366
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,840
Well, and he managed to just make it as awkward as possible

1367
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,640
because he's Biden,

1368
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,640
so he's talking about a Jewish Prime Minister.

1369
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,240
So he's like, I need to have a come to Jesus moment for Bibi.

1370
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:49,840
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1371
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,400
Is there a Jewish,

1372
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,320
is there a Jewish counterpart to the phrase come to Jesus?

1373
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,280
Neither of us are the ones to answer that question,

1374
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,240
but I'm curious anyway, please go on.

1375
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,480
No, but I think, I think,

1376
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:04,800
I think that that hopefully, as time goes on,

1377
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:12,760
that those efforts accelerate and there is some sort of resolution. But I think this is something

1378
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:17,640
that history will really condemn Biden and his administration for. I think that you can count

1379
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:23,480
in the thousands of lives the amount of people that would have been saved if Biden has had acted

1380
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:31,240
sooner. And again, even from the narrow standpoint of Israeli defense, I don't think there's a

1381
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:38,600
credible argument that killing several thousand more civilians in the operation is going to make

1382
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:49,880
Israel safer as opposed to continuing the conflict and perpetuity. And that being said,

1383
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:55,880
I actually am not of the opinion that Biden's actions will be a decisive

1384
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:08,840
factor in the race in November 2024, I think. Really? And I say this with using my words

1385
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:13,080
carefully. I don't think this is a good thing, but I do think that a lot of voters,

1386
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:22,040
if the Israeli assault ends in the next month or two, a lot of voters will move on by then.

1387
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:29,720
And again, I don't think they should, especially with 30 plus thousand people dead. But I think

1388
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:35,640
they will move on for them. The news cycle will move on like we've seen time and time again in

1389
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:44,840
these sorts of cases. And also the real politic will overwhelm people. And some of this is very

1390
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:51,640
rational. We choose once over four years not who we want to be in charge in a positive sense,

1391
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:56,840
but we often have to choose who we are on the far left, who we want to be in opposition to,

1392
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:04,360
or for ordinary people like who's the lesser evil. And I think that for a lot of people,

1393
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:12,520
that's going to be Joe Biden. And I think among a lot of voters in places like Michigan,

1394
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:20,680
I think they're going to feel the pressure to vote for Biden. I think given the constraints of our

1395
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:27,000
of our political system, it makes perfect sense that those people would vote for Biden.

1396
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:34,600
Then again, I do feel like the credible threat of exit is an important way to actually influence

1397
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,960
mainstream Democratic Party politicians. And that's attention. That's a balancing act between

1398
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,480
listening to people's concerns about a Trump, a second presidency, but also wanting to be

1399
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:50,440
oppositional enough that we could actually be a pressure group from the outside.

1400
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:58,840
And I think that DSA members at an individual level in the organization has tried to do that

1401
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:08,600
balancing act. And sometimes I think they don't get enough credit for how well they're doing that.

1402
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:16,360
I think the DSA, no endorsement is in and of itself not allowing members to do what they want

1403
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,960
and to make their own decisions. And the vast majority of those members will vote for Biden

1404
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:26,040
in swing states, but it also maintains DSA as a credible oppositional force in a Democratic Party

1405
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,800
that really does need one in an American civil society that does need one.

1406
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:36,760
I really appreciate your description of it as a balancing act, because there's a constant tension

1407
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:43,080
between, you know, when folks say, I can never vote for Biden because of his support for Netanyahu

1408
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:47,480
or the United States' material support to Israel. Well, that's something that you have to accept.

1409
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:52,280
And yet you're like, well, hold on a second, there are two alternatives here. And, you know,

1410
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:59,320
we don't want the worse of the two. But if you go vote blue, no matter who, then you remove the

1411
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:06,760
ability to put any pressure on. And so you do need to find, like both things are true at once,

1412
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:15,240
and you need to find a middle between them. And I agree that I have seen some DSA groups,

1413
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:21,160
I think, being sophisticated politically in how they handle it. I guess my broader concern

1414
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:29,000
when, you know, apart from my deep concern for everybody in that region and for the citizens

1415
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,280
of Gaza, when all of that went down, and my concern about those specific policies was

1416
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:41,720
the left has a reputation and a history of splintering throughout groups, not limited to DSA,

1417
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:47,960
throughout its history. And I saw splintering happen just in my own political waters here in

1418
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:52,920
Los Angeles, splintering occurred. People who had previously been in coalition in the movement

1419
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:58,520
with each other suddenly said, I can never fuck with those people again. And, you know, on both

1420
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:03,720
sides of that. And, you know, if you are interested in political change and you understand, hey, that

1421
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:10,280
requires everyone to get on the same side, or everyone to push in the same direction, regardless

1422
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:15,560
of your feelings of the actual policy, like to see the splintering can be difficult and lamentable.

1423
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:21,960
And so I'm curious how you think about that broader issue within left politics of, you know,

1424
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:26,600
backbiting, people will complain about purity testing. I don't really like that phrase, but

1425
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:32,120
that's a common complaint that you hear, etc. That sort of perennial problem and how can the

1426
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:38,680
left overcome it? Well, I think that the splintering is pretty common in a lot of

1427
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:46,120
of like-minded ideological groups or even just groups in general. We just happen to live in

1428
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:53,240
society where there isn't that much organized activity anymore. This is the old kind of Putnam,

1429
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:59,720
like bowling alone description of how it out or our socialized and our socialized.

1430
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:04,840
This book has come up on this show so many times. At some point, I got to get, he's not dead, is he?

1431
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,560
I got to get him on the show to talk about it, because it's come up over and over again.

1432
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,440
I think Robert Putnam is still around, but he must be pretty old by this point.

1433
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:20,520
He's around. I take credit. I don't take credit. Jackabin, I think, should take some credit for

1434
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:25,480
its resurrection because we published a few articles about it a couple of years ago. So I

1435
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:32,600
think we got some of the left talking about it. But if you look at the history of the American

1436
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:37,160
political right, if you look at the history of religious groups, especially a lot of the words

1437
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:45,320
we use to describe the left, like sectarianism, where does this come from? This comes from the

1438
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:51,640
million different splits of religious groups into sectarian groups. I think in general,

1439
01:08:52,680 --> 01:09:00,680
it's something that I personally like to avoid. I like to try to be one ecumenical, but have my

1440
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:05,880
beliefs, but figure out how do you create a box where we could have different ideas and have

1441
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:10,520
contestation within that box. But like you said, still move together in the same direction,

1442
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:18,680
and that's different than a line. A box has room for eclectic decisions and debates

1443
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:24,280
over tactics and strategy. But as long as you figure out here are five core principles,

1444
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:28,440
here's where we're aligned on, then we can move forward. I think sometimes when it comes to

1445
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:34,920
an issue like Israel, Palestine, I think if our demand right now is ceasefire now,

1446
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,160
I think that is a pretty broad demand that can incorporate a lot of different voices,

1447
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:47,000
including liberal Zionists and others. Everyone from liberal Zionists to revolutionaries to

1448
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,080
people who believe in democratic one state, I think we can all be in that tent together and we

1449
01:09:53,080 --> 01:10:06,600
can decide, debate 67 versus 48 versus one state solution some other time or within that tent.

1450
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:12,760
So I actually think that the left in general has done a pretty good job in being led by groups,

1451
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:18,040
like the solidarity movement. A lot of the great actions have been by groups like Jewish

1452
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:23,880
voices for peace that have abused, I think really inclusive rhetoric and have talked about the fact

1453
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:30,600
that their core members are Jewish Americans and here's why they're concerned by Israel's

1454
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:37,640
actions. And I think, again, that's different than having a left that was so pure that said,

1455
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:44,280
you can't say one word about Israeli civilians or you can't say one word about

1456
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:52,280
two states or whatever. And if you say that, you can't be part of our ceasefire now movement.

1457
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:57,400
If it was like that, then I would say that we're in a moment that's too sectarian.

1458
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:04,840
I think that for now, the rhetoric I think is very good, the demand is broad and also the

1459
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:11,160
rhetoric is about our basic human values. It's about the right of children to have access to

1460
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:17,480
nutrition and people to not be under siege and against collective punishment, things that I

1461
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:21,080
think are really broad. But going back to you mentioned Sean Finn before, and I think that

1462
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:28,440
part of his appeal is that he's both a leader in the labor movement. He's both someone with a huge

1463
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:35,800
base of support through the UAW with ordinary working class people, but also he draws on his

1464
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:41,400
Christian values when he talks about his socialist values, when he talks about being an egalitarian

1465
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:49,800
and when he talks about where wealth comes from and how the fruits of one's labor should be

1466
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:55,480
distributed. And I think that's really powerful. And when I think about what kind of left wing

1467
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:01,560
rhetoric can actually reach 100, 200 million Americans, I would imagine that sounds something

1468
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:09,320
like that. I agree with that. And looking forward is how I'd like to end here. You opened by saying

1469
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:15,240
over the last 10 years, moved from socialism being dead to being on life support. First of all,

1470
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:19,000
that's pretty impressive because a resurrection happened in the middle there, which is a miracle.

1471
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:25,320
So let's say that's an accomplishment for your movement. I would love you for you to paint a

1472
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:29,400
picture of 10 years from now, right? Because you've said, hey, we need these charismatic leaders.

1473
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:34,680
I don't see someone stepping up in electoral politics to take the Bernie Sanders crown currently.

1474
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:42,200
No one is running for president this year with that sort of overtly socialist politics.

1475
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:50,680
By the way, DSA membership I've read has slightly declined or at least plateaued for a little bit.

1476
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:56,200
In terms of growth, after we've seen a lot of growth in the last 10 years,

1477
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:01,320
how does the movement continue growing and where do you see it in your rosiest view?

1478
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:08,040
Well, my rosiest view, I think that a lot of the younger people who move left on key issues,

1479
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:13,960
we could connect with them and get them to engage in politics. And we connect with them. We tell them

1480
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:22,760
engaging with politics isn't just about having a persona online or having a set of likes and

1481
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,280
dislikes, but actually being involved in a union. And if you're in a workplace that is

1482
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:33,640
unionized or can't be unionized, it's getting involved in your local community. It's either

1483
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:40,040
connecting with groups like DSA or Jewish Worship Peace, some of the far left groups that I mentioned.

1484
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:45,160
But it also means for people who maybe have different persuasions politically,

1485
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:52,600
connecting with the local, even becoming a delegate at the DNC, something I wouldn't do

1486
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:57,720
in a thousand years. And my mind isn't worth my time. But for other people, that might be how

1487
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:03,240
they connect with politics. Look, taking over your local chapter of your local party is very

1488
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:07,640
powerful politically. You have to sit through a lot of really shitty meetings. But you show up

1489
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,280
to another of those meetings, you could be running the place within a couple of years.

1490
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:21,880
Yeah, or getting involved with your local abortion access campaign or a host of things,

1491
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:27,080
but still identifying broadly as being on the left or being part of any egalitarian

1492
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:34,680
current. And a current that basically says we don't want a world where people get by and get ahead

1493
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:42,440
through bullying or where we allow people to achieve exalted positions by being bullied.

1494
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:49,320
We want a world in which ordinary people can work hard and be able to take care of themselves

1495
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:58,200
and their families. And to me, like Trump embodies the very worst of Americans. One is like personally

1496
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:05,240
pretty detestable. Even though he's occasionally funny, we could acknowledge. He's someone who just

1497
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:13,080
constantly brags about being a bully. And his version of dealmaking is zero sum. Whereas I think

1498
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:20,280
our vision for the United States, for the world is a very positive sum vision of expanding justice

1499
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:26,120
and expanding prosperity and the world being a better place. And I think that's a message that

1500
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:31,800
60 percent of the United States and 60 percent of the world can get behind. I don't think we'll

1501
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:37,720
ever get a full 100. But I think that that appeal for that is far greater than where their DSA,

1502
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:43,320
I think we have declined about 85,000 or 100,000. Either way, it's a country of 330 million people.

1503
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:48,440
So I think this broad based movement in which I think socialists have a really important role to

1504
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:57,800
play. Connecting, I think, these values, which are really commonly shared with the idea of struggle.

1505
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:03,560
Because struggle means that it's not just we have this nice set of shared values we can all

1506
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:10,040
march towards. But there is a small minority of people who do have a vested interest in keeping

1507
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:16,280
people divided and keeping everything from our workplaces structured as undemocratically as they

1508
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:23,240
are to our tax code written in the way it's written. And that's I think what liberalism is

1509
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:30,360
often missed, this theory of politics and these theories of conflict. So I would love socialism

1510
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:36,760
to be a complementary piece of the puzzle, changing liberalism. And then in turn, being

1511
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:42,600
shaped by the people we're interacting with who aren't socialists, I think there's really a broad

1512
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:48,360
movement that we can build in the here and now. Yeah. And I've seen that happen. I mean, in the

1513
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:54,440
writer's guild, in the writer's strike, we have 10,000 to 12,000 members, depending on how you

1514
01:16:54,440 --> 01:17:00,760
want to count. And there are genuinely folks from all political persuasions. There are Republicans

1515
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:06,360
and Democrats and all other sorts of folks in the union. But the one thing that almost everyone in

1516
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:13,240
the union 95%, 99% of people in the union agree on is that the bosses are trying to screw us and

1517
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:18,920
then if we fight back, we can win. And so there's people who I know I disagree with them politically

1518
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:23,720
on many things, but we march together in solidarity and we know that we stand there going, hey, but

1519
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:29,800
we're doing this together right now. And that feels more important, more powerful and separate

1520
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:38,440
from who we voted for for governor or whatever. Or what cable news channel we watch. It's a

1521
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:47,400
politics that we live rather than simply identify with and click a button about. And the fact that

1522
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:54,520
so many people responded to it around the country. And in my view, the reason our strike went viral

1523
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:59,160
nationally was people watched it and said, I want to do that too. I faced that in my job. How do I

1524
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:06,520
do that in my life? That to me was really evidence. These are ideas and a struggle with a broad appeal

1525
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:11,000
if we can fucking figure out how to harness it. Yeah, I think you, you proved it through practice

1526
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:17,240
too. You had your theory that we can make change. You brought together a diverse coalition to make

1527
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:22,120
change and people saw the results. So now it's going to be easier the next time around. Now,

1528
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:28,920
with the Bernie campaign, with all these other struggles, the key is to actually rack up victories

1529
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:33,560
and to give people a sense that politics isn't just something I'm going to do for fun

1530
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:40,280
when I have free time between the ages of 18 and 26, the time in our lives where we have the,

1531
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:46,200
for many of us, the most free time, but that it's actually an important route to achieve tangible

1532
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:51,080
victories. And it's something that we can continue in various forms throughout our lives. And I think

1533
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:58,440
that's the goal of any broad left movement is to achieve some victories and then add on to the

1534
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,960
victories. Well, I feel badly that we have talked for over an hour and I haven't even gotten into

1535
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:10,200
your publishing work. So let's end there and tell me a little bit about where people can find the

1536
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:15,640
work that you do at The Nation and at Jacobin and, you know, the importance of that work as your

1537
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:22,440
final plug and telling us about what you do. Well, I'm the president of The Nation magazine,

1538
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,280
which is kind of a ridiculous title, but basically the publisher of The Nation.

1539
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:32,920
You're literally, it's called The Nation. You're the president. You're the potus.

1540
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,760
You're the panodist. I don't know, there's something in there.

1541
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:43,560
And The Nation has been around since 1865. So it was founded by abolitionists in 1865. It's a

1542
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:48,680
longest standing, you know, liberal left publication in this country. It's been

1543
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:56,040
generally on the right side of history. All those years, 165 years on questions of

1544
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:02,680
one piece in the like 159 years. That was pretty bad. I'm still living in the past. In my mind,

1545
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:10,680
it's, you know, it's not 2024. But I'm also the founding editor of Jack from Magazine,

1546
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:15,480
which is a quarterly magazine. I think for my money, it's the best looking publication in the

1547
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:19,400
entire country. The design is incredible of this magazine. Like, it's like, you want to cut the

1548
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:24,280
pages out and put them on the wall. I subscribed for one year just to get the print product and

1549
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:30,840
it truly is beautiful. And yeah, I'm also working on a few books, but my last one was The Socialist

1550
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:39,320
Manifesto, which yeah, as I work on my second book now, I'm not sure how I managed to write a book

1551
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:44,680
in the past. Like, this is like, you know, five, six years ago. So there were still smartphones

1552
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:49,160
and all these distractions. But for some reason, it was a lot easier than now.

1553
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:54,200
Well, I look forward to the new book. And thank you so much for coming on this show,

1554
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:57,960
