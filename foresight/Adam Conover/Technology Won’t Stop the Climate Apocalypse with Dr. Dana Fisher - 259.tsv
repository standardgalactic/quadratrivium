0	5600	Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.
5600	10160	This week, we're talking once again about climate change. See, a couple weeks ago,
10160	14800	I had Dr. Hannah Ritchie on the show, and she made the case that if you look at all these different
14800	20880	indices, emissions per capita, the price of renewable energy, deforestation, a lot of things are
20880	26320	moving in the right direction, and that that is cause for hope. Now, I expressed some skepticism
26320	30400	about this and a lot of you did as well in the comments below the episode. And that's because,
30400	34800	you know, we have made some progress, but the progress we have made is clearly insufficient.
34800	38640	And even though we've made progress on some solutions that have leveraged the power of
38640	43120	capitalism to say, make one kind of energy cheaper than another, sell electric cars and stuff like
43120	48640	that, well, that's kind of the easy solution, isn't it? To sell clean energy when it's just as cheap
48640	54960	as fossil fuels. But getting people, or God forbid, massive corporations to give up fossil fuels is
54960	60800	hard. So how do we push powerful interest in governments to overlook short-term profit for
60800	66800	the long-term benefits of having a planet that's, you know, habitable? I ask how, because clearly,
66800	73200	we haven't done it yet. Climate change is only partially a problem of technology. Primarily,
73200	79280	it's a social problem that our entire society caused. And it's an open question whether our
79280	84080	collective decision-making institutions are advanced enough to deal with that problem.
84080	88560	I mean, it's much easier to make a cheaper solar cell than it is to get all world governments to
88560	94640	agree to decarbonize, but mass decarbonization is what we actually need, right? So if we want to
94640	99840	look at how society can change, we need to look at more than just technological fixes. We have to
99840	106000	look at the science behind what causes social change in institutional transformation that is a huge
106000	110800	and hard problem. And you can't figure it out just by looking at the atmosphere or brand new
110880	116320	awesome clean technologies. You need to talk to a sociologist. Well, guess what? On the show this
116320	121520	week, we in fact have a sociologist who has written an incredible new book about how we can
121520	126800	actually create the massive social change we need to fight climate change in the face of
126800	131200	corporate opposition to that change. I know you are going to love this interview, but before we
131200	135280	get to it, I just want to remind you that if you want to support this show and all the conversations

155120	160560	And now let's get to today's guest. I am so excited to introduce you to Dr. Dana Fisher.
160560	165040	She's a sociologist and she's the director of the Center for Environment, Community and Equity
165040	168800	and a professor in the School of International Service at American University.
168800	172720	She's been following the politics and sociology of climate change for decades,
172720	178000	and her new book is called Saving Ourselves from Climate Shocks to Climate Action. Please welcome
178000	185200	Dr. Dana Fisher. Dana, thank you so much for being on the show. Thank you for having me, Adam.
185200	189040	So we talk about climate change a lot on this show. Normally, I'm talking to climate
189040	193440	scientists, technologists, people like that. You are a sociologist. You have written a book
193440	200480	about the climate crisis. From a social perspective, why is that such an important lens to use?
200480	205680	Well, I mean, at this point, everybody recognizes that the climate crisis is actually a social
205680	211760	problem, right? We created the problem, we society, and the only way to solve it is actually through
211760	217120	us. Society is going to have to solve it. It's not like the planet is going to save itself,
217120	222560	right? We got to do it because we got to fix the problem we created. So sociology makes a lot of
222640	225760	sense as a place to look for that because we study social processes.
225760	232720	Right. We can learn as much as we want about the atmosphere or about clean energy technology,
232720	237360	but if we don't understand the people who are actually going to implement those things or do
237360	240160	something about it, then we're going to be up Chitts Creek, right?
240160	243920	Right. I mean, I think it's worth noting here that there are a lot of natural scientists and
243920	249200	atmospheric scientists who have started talking about policy, have started talking about the
249200	254960	social side because they are social beings, and that's great. But there are those of us who are
254960	260320	trained and have PhD specifically in actually studying the social processes and how they work
260320	265600	and have spent our lives and our careers doing that, and I'm one of them. And so we're, I mean,
265600	271840	I think that we provide a lot of opportunity to think through, based on research, how social
271840	278160	systems work and what will be opening opportunities and what will probably not work.
278160	282400	Great. Well, let's zoom out and start using that lens. A lot of people have a lot of different
282400	286640	stances on climate change. People are techno optimists, whatever. You told me before we started
286640	291040	recording, you would describe yourself as an apocalyptic optimist. I want to know what that
291040	295520	means and how do you frame the problem of climate change like most broadly?
295520	301920	Okay. So I'm an apocalyptic optimist. That means that I believe that we are in trouble and that bad
301920	306640	things are coming and that it is bad. It's getting worse and nothing we've done so far is going to
306640	312320	solve the problem yet. But I am optimistic because while it's bad and it's getting worse,
312320	316400	I believe that we have the capacity to save ourselves and I talked through the book,
316400	320480	how we're going to do that. But it's all going to come from us, right? It is not going to be
320480	323520	like the technology that's going to fall from the sky and everybody's going to be like, oh,
323520	326640	I thought that was going to be bad, but it's okay. It's not going to work that way. It's
326640	331040	rather that it's going to involve struggle and work and we're going to have to all get angry to
331040	336320	do it. With regard to understanding the climate crisis and what it is, I mean, basically,
336320	341840	in the broadest way, it is the fact that the entire world, the entire industrial system,
341840	348080	is run on burning fossil fuels, which is basically having the unintended consequence
348080	353120	of increasing concentration of greenhouse gases. The one that we talk about the most is carbon
353120	361360	dioxide in the atmosphere, which is changing the way that our planet absorbs heat. And also,
361360	366800	that is then having an effect on all sorts of environmental systems and climate systems
366800	373680	and the oceans and the poles and the ice caps, et cetera, and so forth. So everything's changing
373680	378080	thanks to these concentrations that have built up over decades now.
378080	382320	Stopping burning fossil fuels basically means that, I mean, I don't know if this is solar,
382320	387840	but I'm assuming it's not. So all of the electricity that we run our lives, our businesses,
388400	393920	most of our transportation, all that has to change. I mean, carbon comes from a whole bunch
393920	401200	of things. Methane emitted by cows, asses. Yes, exactly. The ruminants, all the ruminants emit
401200	405280	methane. It's just that cows get most of the attention. You know, goats do it too. So there
405280	409760	you have it. Well, if you're in a goat cheese, you know. If you're getting birria tacos, like
409760	414400	you are also emitting methane. So sorry, but please go on. Anyway, so the problem is really
414400	420800	tricky because we have to change the entire system that we are running our economies on,
420800	425360	basically. I mean, there are a couple of countries that have done relatively well because they have
425360	430880	the capacity for clean energy. Some countries like Norway, for example, dammed their rivers early on,
430880	437280	so that 99% of all their electricity is actually coming from clean energy because it's hydropower.
437280	440800	And there were very few people except for indigenous folks who lived up there. So they
440800	445040	were able to do it really easily. We don't have that capacity here in the United States. Most
445040	450640	countries don't have that capacity. Isn't Norway also a huge oil driller? Like, don't they have a
450640	457440	gigantic sovereign wealth fund that comes from oil reserves? They absolutely do. And in fact,
457440	461200	one of the things that's kind of ironic about it is they are using those resources to
462080	468080	incentivize people within the country to switch to electric vehicles, right? But they're still
468080	472160	making money. They're still opening up areas for extraction, but then they're selling the oil to
472160	476000	other countries. Yeah. See, this is a little bit of a tangent, but I went to Norway a couple years ago
476000	480000	and a lovely country. One of those countries where you go and you're like, why can't everything be
480000	484000	like, oh, they got solar panels. They got wind, oh, everything's so nice here. Oh, my, everyone's so
484000	487760	polite. Oh, they got public transportation. Everything's good. And then I'll look around for a
487760	491680	little while. What's funding it? This kind of feels like I'm going to my, like a rich kid's house,
491680	495680	you know? Like, I live, like I'm in a neighborhood, I'm middle class, but oh, come over to my house.
496240	500640	This kid's got a super Nintendo. They got like a fridge with a nice dispenser. What's going on?
500640	504880	Oh, what does his dad's do for a living, right? Like this is, this is wealth that I'm looking at.
504880	510320	And where does the wealth come from? They have a gigantic nationalized oil reserves that they're
510320	515760	selling to other countries. So it's a little bit of like underneath the surface, there is a dark
515760	520160	participation in the same system that we're all a part of. Absolutely. I mean, and what's interesting
520160	525520	is that when folks talk about countries addressing climate change, a lot of them
525520	530080	are talking just about what they're doing within their borders, right? But a lot of countries,
530080	535200	including the United States, has considered basically addressing climate change internally,
535200	539440	but then continuing to self also feels abroad, right? So for example, in the United States,
539440	544640	there's a big push to talk about how we could sell our natural gas to other countries because,
544640	548640	you know, it's cleaner and, you know, and our labor practices are better, which, you know,
548640	553120	may very well be somewhat true, but it really doesn't solve the problem. So anyway, going back
553120	558720	to the question. So the climate crisis is a really tricky one because it basically involves
558720	563280	shifting everything and all the ways that we have industrialized and the ways that we live our lives.
564400	569760	And that's one of the reasons that nothing really has been done in the past 25 years or 30 years
569760	574720	since the climate regime began, which is the international kind of efforts to address climate
574720	578880	change. But I think with regard to techno optimism, the reason I'm no longer a techno
578880	585120	optimist is because I have, you know, I have supported and been excited by a number of different
585120	589520	fads. In fact, I was just had a friend of mine who reached out and was like, oh yeah,
589520	593840	clean hydrogen. Green, or sorry, they're calling it green hydrogen now. Green hydrogen, that's the
593840	599440	answer, right? And the deal is that when I was in college, which was in the 1990s, we went through
599440	603520	a whole period of time where we were like, ooh, hydrogen is going to be the future, right? I mean,
604000	609440	that was a long time ago now. I recognize that. It's just that if we keep counting on technology
609440	613840	that's not here yet, we're running out of time. Hey, so that's five years away that's going to
613840	619760	fix everything. And then you have to have diffusion of the technology. I mean, it's just,
619760	626000	it's not going to solve the problem if you want to save large portions of the world that are
626000	630240	basically, I mean, some of them are already going to be lost, right? Lots of small island states are
630240	634320	going to be lost. Lots of coastal areas are going to be lost. Lots of developing countries are going
634320	639520	to have to shift their populations to areas that are cooler or have the resources because
639520	644160	a lot of folks are becoming, areas are becoming resource scarce because of the climate crisis
644160	650080	in terms of water, in terms of food. And as a result of all of that, we're going to basically
650080	654560	have to think about how we address it. And leaning into this idea that don't worry the
654560	659600	technology is almost here, right, is just extremely dangerous. And it's not just dangerous globally,
659600	663520	but it's dangerous for us here in the United States. I mean, look at Arizona. I mean, look
663520	667840	at some parts of California this past summer and this coming summer is going to be even worse.
667840	672720	Yeah. So you said that nothing has been done or very little has been done for the past few decades.
672720	676080	A number of weeks ago, we had a wonderful guest on named Hannah Richie who wrote a book called
676080	679680	Not the End of the World, a lot of the thesis of the, and by listening to the episode, if you
679680	682720	haven't, it was a wonderful conversation. It's a great conversation. I listened to it yesterday.
682720	686320	Oh, okay, great. So I'd like to put you in dialogue with that because I think it'll be really
686320	692800	interesting. Now, her take is, you know, I think a lot of people feel as I did, you know, I grew up
692800	697600	in the Captain Planet era, we have to save the planet needs to happen. And then, you know, here
697600	703600	I am 25 years later, right? I'm like, we didn't do it. We didn't save the planet. Sure. Things
703600	707840	sure seem to be getting worse. What the fuck, right? And a lot of Hannah's argument is like,
707840	711600	actually, a lot of progress has been made. If we look at these charts and look at these graphs,
711600	717600	we can see a lot of shocking, surprising progress has been made and we need to continue that and
717600	721360	increase it. She's often described by people as a techno optimist. Certainly people were in the
721360	727840	comments of our post on YouTube calling her that. So I'm curious how you engage with that argument.
727840	731680	What do you think that argument gets right? And what do you think it gets wrong with all respect?
731680	737440	Yeah, I mean, so I would just say that, you know, the analysis is legitimate in that it is true that
737440	743120	a number of environmental problems have improved over the years. The problem with climate change,
743120	747920	however, I mean, and climate change is the issue that I have focused basically my whole career
747920	753040	the past 25 years on, is that climate change is a political issue. In fact, it's a social
753040	758160	problem in that we have caused the problem and we, as a society, are going to have to solve it.
758160	766160	And to date, the most valuable measure of success of our efforts to address climate change
766160	771280	would be concentrations of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And if
771280	777520	you look at every one of those charts, it's like a straight slope. So it's not tapering off. It's
777520	785200	not like flattening at all. No, I mean, there was a blip during COVID and we are back on track
785200	791200	just like we were before. So yes, there has been a lot of efforts. There have been efforts globally
791200	797360	through multiple efforts through treaties. I actually studied a bunch of them. So I mean,
797360	801200	I started out my dissertation was on the Kyoto Protocol, which was like a lifetime ago, which
801200	807680	was one of the efforts to address climate change. It was not successful for a number of reasons.
807680	812240	More recently, we have the Paris Agreement where most countries have not yet met and are not going
812240	819600	to meet their commitments that they made back in 2015, right? Yeah. So the thing about, you know,
819680	825840	the argument is that we, you know, while things are getting better and we are per person maybe
825840	831440	emitting less, we're still emitting more, right? And concentrations of the atmosphere are continuing
831440	835760	to go up. And that is the only thing that the earth cares about, right? The earth doesn't care
835760	842000	about if each person is emitting less. I mean, sure, that's better. But the population is going
842000	848320	up too, right? So I mean, and so for me, you know, I'm looking at the bottom line and I also
848320	852080	am looking at the politics of it, right? The other thing that a lot of people talk about is how we
852080	855920	do have policies, right? We have a policy in place here in the United States now, finally,
855920	861360	after years. And I have studied all of the failed policies before. So I was delighted to be able to
861360	867040	write a paper about a successful policy in the Inflation Reduction Act. But not, you know, still
867840	873680	we continue to emit more greenhouse gases every year and temperatures are going up and we got a
873680	879040	problem. So, you know, there's been going on for decades. They've been having these big conferences
879040	882960	and everyone's optimistic, right? Right afterwards. I remember I did an episode of Adam ruins
882960	889120	everything right after the Paris Agreement. And, you know, we, we covered it as it was covered by
889120	893440	basically everyone at the time. This is the largest step that's ever been taken. It shows
893440	897600	international cooperation on a scale we've never seen before. It's, you know, there's such reason
897600	902560	for optimism, et cetera. Or this is the best reason for optimism that we have. And here we are
902560	907440	sitting here, you know, what, seven years, eight years later, just sort of casually describing it
907440	912160	as, ah, well, you know, none of them are going to meet the targets, right? So what are the
912800	917360	impediments to when all of the people at these conferences and all the people running the most
917360	922880	important countries, US, European countries, China all agree about the problem, right? They're
922880	928640	certainly not ignorant about it. Why is progress not being made? Well, I mean, before we, before
928640	932000	we talk about progress not being made, I just want to say, I mean, one of the things that's
932000	938320	interesting is that so they do, they have these meetings every year and people fly all over the
938320	945520	world to go to them and the participation at these events has exploded over the past few years.
945520	950160	And I mean, this past year, they had this wonderful diagram of all the people who took
950160	955840	private planes in and came in and I mean, including some well-known folks here in the
955840	959840	United States who showed up in their private planes. They didn't even carpool. They just,
959840	964720	they all took their own private planes, showed up and then like, we're like, oh, climate change,
964720	968640	bad. We have to do something about climate change. Yeah. But they're not actually practicing what
968640	973120	they preach. Now, so I just want to make these individuals are so important that, of course,
973120	978400	their travel is worth, you know, it's a little extra carbon, but, you know,
978400	982160	Bill Gates, he's got to be here and there, right? He's got to be, if he doesn't get
982160	988960	from Lisbon to Buenos Aires in whatever, 20 minutes, then people are going to die, right?
989520	994080	I mean, I would just say like, let's just start with carpooling or whatever you call it when
994080	997440	it's air pooling. I don't know what the word is, right? I mean, let's just start that.
999120	1002160	You want to hit your ride? Like we're going the same way. We can save gas.
1002160	1006400	And they can join Taylor, right? I mean, she flies all over. She's flying constantly. I mean,
1006400	1009200	they're doing a big move around here. You should just have the climate conference
1009200	1013680	where the Taylor Swift concert is happening, right? That would save a lot of carbon emissions.
1013680	1017520	I mean, I would just say that, I mean, I also would love it if she would think about maybe
1017520	1022400	cutting down the pyrotechnics a little. I don't know if you've been to a Taylor Swift concert.
1022400	1024640	I have kids. I've been to many Taylor Swift concerts.
1025840	1029920	You're there with like an air quality sensor going like, uh, guys were in the purple, like
1029920	1033280	she said, don't breathe in, everybody hold your breath now. I mean, but it's also,
1033920	1038560	you know, it's very consumptive. Let's just put it that way. But okay, going back to your question,
1038560	1042560	yes, I can remember what your question was. Oh, why is it not working? Is that the question? Okay,
1042560	1048720	so the reason it's not working is that all of these countries are symbolically gesturing
1048720	1051760	that they care about climate change. I mean, everybody, everybody cares about climate change
1051760	1056560	now except for a very small proportion of people in the United States. But that's different from
1056560	1062720	actually acting on it because acting on it is not easy. Like we talked about before. So to act on
1062720	1068800	it means basically committing to phase out fossil fuels and fossil fuels are a huge part of economies
1068800	1074160	of many industrialized nations. We just talked about Norway, the United States number one natural
1074160	1081040	gas exporter and oil exporter right now. So yay us. But I mean, that means that for us to actually
1081040	1085360	follow through on commitments to phase out fossil fuels means there's going to be a lot of folks
1085360	1089760	who have what we call privileged access to resources in the form of access to
1090720	1095520	fossil fuel resources. They're subsidized, right? So they get subsidized access to our federal lands
1095520	1102480	to drill and take what they can. They also have privileged access to power. And they get that
1102480	1107120	because they basically contribute to campaigns. And it's not just Republicans, it's folks across
1107120	1112800	the aisle who take that money and research shows us that when you take money from the fossil fuel
1112800	1117360	interest, even if you run on a climate sensitive platform where you say you care about climate
1117360	1120720	change, you want to do something about climate change, when you're asked to vote, you will vote
1120720	1126160	with the people who fund you. And so that happens all over the world. But United States is a great
1126160	1133200	example of it. So there is a very, very strong concentrated interest in maintaining the status
1133200	1139040	quo. And so fossil fuel interests that run countries, run companies, run our industries,
1139040	1143520	they are basically pushing back. I mean, I was a contributing author for the Intergovernmental
1143520	1149280	Panel on Climate Change for the most recent round, the most recent assessment. We call that the IPCC.
1149280	1154800	And so I actually, I wrote this section on civic activism and engagement for working group three,
1154800	1158960	which is on mitigation. So that's the folks who are talking about how to reduce the carbon that
1158960	1164800	goes into the atmosphere. And I was so excited to be asked to do this. This is the first time they
1164800	1169520	ever asked people to talk about activism and engagement. That's what we individuals and
1169520	1173680	those people who are not in the government and not in business is what we can do about the problem.
1173680	1179440	So I was very excited to write that. I wrote this. I contributed like 10 pages.
1179440	1186640	They took three paragraphs, which is how these things work. But when they go from the contribution
1186640	1190480	to what ends up going to the countries, what goes to the countries is what's called the
1190480	1194800	summary for policymakers, where they do, it's like the Cliff Notes version. So my chapter was
1194800	1200560	over 100 pages long. I think it ended up being like 20 pages maybe. I got two sentences in there.
1200560	1205360	But countries get to approve what goes in there and they took out all reference to fossil fuels.
1205360	1211200	Wow. So, I mean, and so because countries, all countries get a say and countries that extract
1211200	1216400	a lot of oil don't want anybody to know. So this was a summary that was put up by the
1216400	1222880	Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Yes. And they took out references to fossil fuels
1222880	1226320	when they were summarizing, which is the part that that's what like Biden, everyone else is
1226320	1229040	reading. They're reading the summary. They're not reading the full version. Oh, sure. Yeah.
1229360	1234880	I mean, and so what they did is we had to change it from fossil fuel interests to what are called
1234880	1241840	vested interests. And the thing is that this was a huge success that vested interest got in. And
1241840	1247200	so we were supposed to be like, oh, yay, we're so lucky. I mean, so in, if you read the chapter,
1247200	1251520	you'll see the references to the role of fossil fuel interests play. And it's extremely well
1251520	1257440	documented. I mean, nobody at this point recognized, like nobody believes that fossil fuels are not
1257440	1262640	playing a big role in contributing to climate change, if you are honest about understanding
1262640	1267280	the science, right? Yeah. But you still can't say it. I mean, and also, I mean, look at what
1267280	1271520	happened at the most recent round of the climate negotiations, there were a bunch of countries
1271520	1279200	that were pushing to get the countries to agree to phase out fossil fuels, right? And it ended up
1279200	1284480	like dragging on and on and on and a bunch of petrol states that extract a whole bunch of fossil
1284480	1288880	fuels pushed back against it. So it ended up being this like mealy mouth, we should think about at
1288880	1296080	some point, phasing out, you know, maybe fossil fuels, you know, I mean, that was the end. I mean,
1296080	1300880	and everybody was like, yay, I mean, and all of these, all of these people in policy, all these
1300880	1307440	people in the media were like, finally, we actually kind of said the quiet part out loud, kind of,
1307440	1310880	but we still didn't. I mean, that's the thing that's crazy about. And so that's the same thing
1311440	1317600	with the science is that when you have politics and science combined, the way you do for this,
1317600	1322080	because this is specifically like a scientific assessment that's designed for the policy
1322080	1328880	community and is coordinated through the different states, when you do that, and you have a bunch
1328880	1334880	of countries that are basically controlled by fossil fuel interests, you know, it's not surprising
1334880	1341200	that we see this kind of tricky situation. But it means, I mean, and the more we know that a systemic
1341200	1347200	shift away from fossil fuel energy towards renewable clean energy is what is needed,
1347200	1352800	the more these interests are going to like claw and just try to control the dialogue as much as
1352800	1357680	they can, so that everyday people don't recognize that when fossil fuel companies give money to
1357680	1361760	candidates who are running for office, like in this election that we have coming up,
1361760	1365120	those people, whether or not they say they care about climate change are absolutely not going
1365120	1371520	to do anything about it. Yeah, because their incentive is not to. But what you're talking about,
1371520	1376000	what you talked about with three different pieces of that story, is politics, right? Like you,
1376560	1381680	when you are writing and trying to get the right language into the report, that's part of the
1381680	1388880	political process, as is fossil fuels companies giving money to candidates, as is entire countries
1388880	1395360	who are basically bent to the will of the fossil fuel makers. But what do we do about that? Because
1395360	1399920	a lot of folks when confronted with the existence of politics will just say, oh,
1399920	1404880	fuck, I can't believe politics got in here. Oh, no, there's people, there's corruption,
1404880	1409040	there's people giving money. Oh, the people who are giving money to do something do the thing
1409040	1412400	that they're giving the money to do. Oh, the people who have the most power get to call the shots,
1412400	1418480	right? But unfortunately, politics is just part of the human condition. Politics simply is,
1418960	1424000	humans in large groups having to make decisions together. And yeah, and unfortunately, people
1424000	1428240	with power get more say, and that's just how the fucking world works. And if you want to do something
1428240	1433600	about it, you have to reckon with the political social system that you live in and figure out how
1433600	1439360	to bend it to your will to do the thing that needs to be done. So I don't want this to be one of those
1439360	1443200	episodes where we sit around going, I can't believe the fossil fuel companies are like,
1443200	1446160	have their finger on the scale, they should stop it because they're not going to.
1446800	1451360	What do we do about that problem? Well, I mean, I just want to say, though, that what you're just
1451360	1455600	pointing out here is exactly why we can't just say everything's going to get better if we ignore
1455600	1462320	politics because that's the way decision making happens. And if you ignore the politics and just
1462320	1466000	assume technology is going to fix everything, well, then you're just going to be really,
1466000	1470960	really sad in like 20 years or even less, right? Guess who's going to be in control of the technology,
1470960	1475360	the people with the political power. And if you didn't ignore politics, or if you didn't pay
1475360	1479120	attention to politics, then you're allowing those people to continue steering the ship.
1479120	1483280	100%. So what's going to happen now? Or what do we need to do right now? I mean,
1483280	1488400	so, I mean, this is what I lay out in the book is that the beginning of the book is all about how
1488400	1493360	we cannot count on decision makers to do what is needed, even though they recognize the problem
1493360	1499200	exists. And the reason that that's the case is that we see these interests that have captured
1499200	1503520	decision making and have this privileged access to resource and power, right?
1503520	1508960	So, okay, so that's not the case. And at the other side of it, businesses, some of which are
1508960	1512400	really excited about technological innovation, they're not going to save us either because
1513360	1516880	many businesses are pushing for a clean energy transition. We have a bunch of other businesses
1516880	1522800	that are clawing their way into extracting as much as possible fossil fuels as they can because they
1522800	1527760	know that eventually they're going to have to stop. And so there's this bipolar pressure between
1527760	1531920	these two. So it's not like we have this monolith of, oh, business is really excited about this
1531920	1537280	technological innovation because they're not. So given that that's the situation, the place where
1537280	1543600	we have to go to get hope is from everyday citizens, you and me, and the way that we ourselves are
1543600	1548560	recognizing how the world is changing, how our lives are changing, and how we have to reclaim
1548560	1552960	power. And one of the beauties of being an American and being in the United States is we still do
1552960	1557840	have a democracy, at least for now. And we should be taking advantage of it because a democracy
1557840	1563440	means that we all have power. We have an imperfect fucked up democracy, but occasionally the will
1563440	1568960	of the people does win. The will of the people can still win, but it's up to us. And that's,
1568960	1572480	I mean, that's the whole argument on my book is that as unfair as it seems, because we didn't
1572480	1578320	really cause the problem and we are trapped in a system that is unfair, but we can still take
1578320	1583280	power back and that's absolutely what we have to do. And so that's the optimistic part of my
1583280	1589600	apocalyptic optimism. So how do we do that? Because again, a Captain Planet generation,
1589600	1594400	right, I grew up with, turn the lights off, buy the better thing, right, maybe feel a little bit
1594400	1600960	guilty when you fly on a plane or whatever, maybe get a Prius, those sorts of things. I've covered
1600960	1607120	extensively in my work why that sort of consumer approach to fighting climate changes, at the very
1607120	1612880	least not going to get us out of the problem all by itself. So yeah, what do we actually do?
1613280	1618960	So what we need to do at this point is we need to lean into activism and engagement. I mean,
1618960	1623360	and I talk about the reason why even though all of these individual efforts like you were talking
1623360	1629360	about can play a role in addressing climate change, given that it's a systemic problem,
1629360	1634240	that's not enough, right? Because anyway, you're going to turn on the lights and unless you are
1634240	1640000	completely off the grid or you're in a very small proportion of the United States where
1640480	1644480	you're on clean energy, you're basically then tapping into the same system, right?
1644480	1649440	There is a really interesting study that I talk about in the book where some students at MIT
1649440	1654640	tried to map out carbon consumption of everyday people and they ended up mapping out the carbon
1654640	1659600	consumption of an unhoused person in Boston, right? So somebody who was homeless, who was
1659600	1663520	living on the streets, but was also going to shelters, right? And they found this person who
1663520	1669840	has no like very few earthly belongings, right? And who is living in a shelter actually has the
1669840	1675600	carbon consumption level of well above most of the developing world, right? Because of the system.
1675600	1681920	So it is a systemic problem. So this is if you were to divest yourself of every single energy
1681920	1687520	consuming thing that you have as an American or a Canadian or someone else living in our,
1687520	1692640	you know, part of the world or our part of the socioeconomic ladder, you literally were living
1692640	1698640	on the street, you would still not be, you know, able to get your individual level down to
1698640	1702800	make people elsewhere in the world. Well, you could live in a bunker and go like completely
1702800	1707200	off the grid, like you can do that. And then you personally will not contribute to the climate
1707200	1711200	crisis, but the system will continue, right? Yeah, exactly. But I mean, but if you just like,
1711200	1716080	if you try everything, like for example, we at home, we have electric cars, we have solar panels,
1716080	1720640	but whenever I go to work, I turn on the lights and my computer runs on the system. And so even
1720640	1724960	though the electricity at home is clean, yeah, it's not clean everywhere else. You're in control
1724960	1730480	of like the cloud servers that Apple is using to store your emails and what power they were like,
1730480	1734960	you're part of a system. Yeah. Yeah. And my Alexa that is tracking everything I said. I didn't even
1734960	1739120	go there. And every once in a while, she just speaks up and says, I hear that you are interested
1739120	1743920	in games to play with your children. Can I suggest some? And it's like, shit, no, I don't want you
1743920	1747600	to suggest. And she's burning fossil fuels every time she listens to you. Well, she at home, she's
1747600	1752240	burning solar. So at least, so at least I have that. But the servers. Oh, yeah. But when she backs
1752240	1756880	out, she backs up absolutely with like probably coal. So, you know, the dirtiest of them all.
1757920	1762480	Anyway, so the question that you asked was about how we take power back. So I was just saying,
1762480	1767600	so individually, we can't do it alone. We need to work collectively. And one of the beautiful
1767600	1772400	things about the United States is that we have a really long history of social movements and
1772400	1777040	activism. So one of the things I do in my book is I basically build off of some of the things that
1777040	1781520	we learn from the civil rights movement, which is the most studied movement ever in the history of
1781520	1787440	the world. So we know a lot about it. But basically, what we can do is join collectives and get
1787440	1793360	engaged in our communities, get engaged in climate activism, climate engagement to help to push for
1793360	1796880	social change. I mean, one of the things that I think is most important is to push for social
1796880	1801120	change from our communities up. So we don't just decide, I mean, and this is something that my
1801120	1804880	students and I are always kind of discussing. I think I've won them over because like in the
1804880	1810640	semester is in like two weeks, which is that you can't really do this all by just going on TikTok.
1810640	1815360	And I think a lot of young people and a lot of students learn that the sad hard way with the
1815360	1819520	decision that the Biden administration made around the Willow project, which is this huge
1819520	1825040	fossil fuel infrastructure project that has been approved by the administration in Alaska.
1825040	1829840	And all of these young people went online and went on TikTok. It was this huge mobilization on
1829840	1835520	TikTok. There was like millions of online signatures onto a petition on change.org.
1836080	1839760	There was a whole bunch of people posting videos about stopping the Willow project.
1840400	1844480	But there was no in-person action or there's very little in-person action. And unfortunately,
1844480	1850000	as a result, or not as a result, but unfortunately, the Willow project moved forward, right? So they're
1850000	1855200	building that out. And a lot of young people are recognizing, I hope they're recognizing and learning
1855200	1859520	that you can't just go online and do this, you need to actually work with people. And the best way
1859520	1864320	to do it is to do it in your community. Well, a lot of people make this argument about online
1864320	1870640	activism. And I see that myself as well, that people tweet and hope it's going to do something.
1870640	1876560	But I also recognize that the reason a lot of people resort to that is they do not have other
1876560	1882080	systems in their lives where they feel like they can express themselves. There isn't a mass movement
1882080	1888080	organization in their area, or they just feel profoundly alienated from their community. A lot
1888080	1896640	of folks don't have other outlets. So that's a real problem that people face. How can people get
1896640	1902720	connected? Especially because I just want to add to this that my own experience following the climate
1902720	1907280	movement is that we have had attempts at mass movement organizations, those organizations,
1907280	1912960	I believe 350.org is at the name of one, the Sunrise Movement, which was doing, I think,
1912960	1916160	incredible work for a couple of years. But in the last couple of years, sort of gone,
1916240	1920880	where are they? No offense to my Sunrise Movement people, right? There's people out there carrying
1920880	1928720	the torch. But we have not seen, I mean, a year or two ago, there was a giant climate mass
1928720	1933680	climate march, I think in multiple cities, barely covered in the press. And so there's been an
1933680	1940160	attempt to build this mass movement akin to the civil rights movement. And yet, for at least a decade,
1940160	1945600	and yet it has not really paid off. So why is that? And how can we change that?
1946240	1949280	You're like, you're like in my sweet spot right now. So thank you very much.
1949280	1950800	Oh, I'm so happy to set up a guest.
1951520	1956720	Thank you so much. Okay, so first and foremost, let me just say that this is completely to be
1956720	1961840	expected. Anybody who remembers the period of the Trump administration, there was this huge
1961840	1965520	resistance to the Trump administration as policies. Anybody who's interested, I wrote a book called
1965520	1969840	American Resistance that was all about it. It was a mass mobilization. It was the largest
1970160	1974320	sustained period where people were in the streets and people were active and engaged,
1974320	1981680	that we have seen since the civil rights period and the anti-war period. So that was like the 1960s,
1981680	1985840	1970s, right? So since then, this was like remarkable. Everybody, I mean, the Washington
1985840	1991840	Post did this survey and they said that like, what was it? One in four people had been to a
1991840	1995520	protest during the first two years of the Trump administration. And there were multiple types
1995520	2000000	of protests. It was the women's march. It was the wake of the murder of George Floyd. It was a
2000960	2004960	bunch of things over a span of years. Yeah, yeah. So it was a span of the whole Trump
2004960	2009520	administration. So the resistance was amazing. And people were the most civically engaged they
2009520	2015840	have been in decades, right? But so what happens when a Democrat takes office is frequently we see
2015840	2020080	the left kind of sitting back. And I actually wrote, I wrote a few, we can take a load off. Oh,
2020080	2026080	boy, what's on TV? I got to, you know, I finally, I can catch up on my reading. Where's my new,
2026080	2031280	where's my pageant book reading? Okay, maybe like, I hope so. Reading is good thing. But
2032000	2037520	so, so it was not surprising. But I mean, and I actually wrote a piece that was like,
2038240	2042800	the, you know, Biden's success is the death of the resistance and the resistance, the resistance
2042800	2047360	did die. So you mentioned a couple of different organizations. I mean, 350.org is still around.
2047360	2052800	They do great work. Sunrise is still around. They do great work. But these groups have a lot less
2052800	2057920	capacity to mobilize people because the general public on the left, when there's a Democrat in
2057920	2061680	the White House, they're like, All right, I think we're good. I'm going to take a load off. I'm going
2061680	2066320	to pay attention to my kids. I'm going to catch up on my Netflix. Maybe they're going to read. I
2066320	2071040	hope they're going to read. But you know, I think maybe maybe they'll read my book. Maybe that'll
2071040	2075520	get them back out in the streets. But I mean, so, so that's all to be expected. And that's what I
2075520	2081120	talk about my book is that we know that, first of all, that activism is cyclical and people are
2081120	2086960	going to need something that motivates them to get out in the streets and to connect collectively,
2086960	2091120	especially because most people don't have what we call like organizational infrastructure,
2091120	2096880	which is connections to organizations that are in their communities that help them get active.
2096880	2101920	And we know that organizations play a very important role in channeling people's concerns,
2101920	2108640	their anger, their outrage into action. So we need that. So how does that then happen? And what I
2108640	2113520	talk about in the book is that it's going to come from the experience of climate shocks.
2113520	2117120	And I can give you, you know, I can give you some evidence around this is that the largest
2117120	2122000	climate march that we've seen since Biden took office. So since, you know, in years now was the
2122000	2127360	March 10 fossil fuels, which happened last fall in New York City. And it was right before the UN
2127360	2132160	meeting where the secretary general said, you have to actually have some sort of commitment or you're
2132160	2135760	not allowed to come to my meeting. And so a bunch of countries, I believe the United States even
2135760	2139760	were not invited. So it was a very interesting. Yeah, it was very interesting. Didn't really do
2139760	2144240	anything. It's a real Regina George move. Yeah, but he was trying. I mean, he was really trying.
2144240	2150240	Anyway, so 75,000 people marched in the streets of New York City. And one of the things I do is
2151040	2156320	I survey protesters. So I went out with a team of researchers, students who were working with me,
2156320	2161920	and we did what we call like a field approximation of a random sample. So we basically went through
2161920	2166320	teams throughout the whole crowd and surveyed people to get information on who they were,
2166320	2170080	why they were there, et cetera, and so forth. You're doing sociology. Yeah, I am a sociologist.
2170080	2174960	Yes. But this is something, this is like a lens that the climate crisis is not often looked at
2174960	2180720	through. It is unfortunately the case. I mean, so it is increasingly looked at through a sociological
2180720	2186080	or social scientific lens. But one of the things that's really unfortunate is that while we know
2186080	2190720	a whole lot about how the world is warming and how a little bit more carbon in the atmosphere will
2190720	2195680	affect warming and will affect hurricanes and et cetera and so forth, I mean, always more accuracy
2195680	2200720	is necessary. We know a heck of a lot less about the people who will respond and what we will do
2200720	2205200	and how it will matter. And so one of my hills that I'm going to die on is saying that we need
2205200	2211120	more research funding to support that because social scientists get like pennies on the dollar.
2211120	2219600	Right. We spend so much money researching the hard sciences. We spend so little on researching
2219600	2225040	the people who we need to implement what the hard sciences come up with.
2225040	2229040	Well, I would say it's even worse than that. It's the people who are causing the problem,
2229920	2233680	as well as the people who are going to have to solve the problem. So we know so little about
2233680	2240480	that. And that was one of the reasons that when I wrote for the IPCC, the rules of the IPCC are
2240480	2245120	you need to be able to prove how whatever you're looking at is associated with carbon.
2245600	2250960	Right. So people march in the streets. Well, how does that affect carbon emissions or decisions
2250960	2255280	around carbon emissions? And there's not that much research. There's a lot more we need to
2255280	2259680	know about that. So I mean, it would be really great for me to be able to say, okay, if you go
2259680	2264720	into a museum and you throw soup on a covering of a painting, it equals this much carbon.
2265520	2268640	Right. I mean, they want me to be able to say that. I mean, I would love to be able to answer
2268640	2273440	that. I mean, are you going to have better effects in terms of reducing carbon emissions
2273440	2278080	if you throw soup on a painting, you glue yourself to a door, or you sit in the middle
2278080	2284720	of the highway, right? But it's an important question. And how much, I mean, so the reason
2284720	2288560	that folks are doing that kind of activism, which is a lot of what I talk about in the book,
2288560	2291680	is because they're trying to get media attention. So it's really like, it's like a boomerang,
2291680	2296000	right? It's an indirect process. So you do those things, you're going to be in the media.
2296000	2299760	And a bunch of people are going to say, he sucks for doing it. And then other people are going to
2299760	2304560	say, but he has a point. I should join a movement. And so they will very rarely be like, I'm going
2304560	2308400	to throw soup. No, they're going to say, I'm going to go work with like a more, you know,
2308400	2314480	a more benign, kinder, gentler group. So I may join like a League of Conservation
2314480	2318720	Photos or Sierra Club or I may do something around my local elections or something to do,
2318720	2322560	you know, to do something around weatherization in my community, something like that, right?
2322560	2325440	So you may get involved in that. But the question is all of that, like,
2326000	2329680	how does that then end up with carbon? Yeah, it would be amazing if we could say,
2329680	2332960	so often folks are presented with a statistic. Oh, if you switch to an electric car,
2332960	2337520	you'll save this many trees, this many tons of carbon, whatever. And that's supposedly a hard
2337520	2342000	calculation, even though there's a lot of assumptions and all that and all that within it.
2342000	2347120	But you could, wouldn't it be wonderful if you could tell people, hey, if you were to join a
2347120	2351280	local chapter of the sunrise movement in your area and go to one meeting a month,
2351280	2356720	it would save this many tons of carbon. We could do that. We just need to be able to develop the
2356720	2362000	models and run them. But those models are, let me just say, like those models are a lot simpler
2362000	2367440	than the models that are being funded right now to talk about how sandstorms over in Africa are
2367440	2371920	contributing to hurricanes. And there are people doing that research. And it's important. I am not
2371920	2375840	saying it's not important. I think everybody should be funded. But I think that, you know,
2375840	2380240	those of us who are trying to answer these questions, we need to understand that. I mean,
2380240	2384960	and we need to be able to think about that, right? What is it? So if I were talking to,
2384960	2389600	like, the general public and you want to do something, is it better for you to support a
2389600	2394960	candidate who won't take fossil fuel money and is running for office locally in terms of your carbon?
2394960	2400560	Or is it better for you to get electric school buses into your schools? Or is it better for you
2400560	2406400	to go and try to get your local school, you know, universities to divest from fossil fuels?
2406400	2413920	Or is it better for you to throw soup on something and or crazy glue your foot to something and get
2413920	2417360	a bunch of media attention so that everybody starts, you know, complaining about you, but
2417360	2421520	talking about the climate crisis, because it absolutely works that way. And I mean, we could
2421520	2425520	do those things. And I'm hoping, you know, there are a couple of us who actually wrote a piece for
2425520	2430240	Nature magazine that came out right before the last climate negotiation. So in the fall,
2430240	2433440	where we basically talked about all the things that we could study and we know a little bit
2433440	2437520	about, but we need to know so much more about. And unfortunately, so far, we haven't gotten one
2437520	2442880	dollar to do that work, but we know that work is necessary. Eventually, we will do the work,
2442880	2447840	but I hope it won't be too late because people need to know now what's the best way to get involved.
2447840	2453200	But any, but my the take home message of the book is that anything that everybody that anybody is
2453200	2458640	willing to do is what you should do, because we are in all hands on deck moment, people need to
2458640	2463440	get involved, they need to get connected, they should do it in their communities. Oh, I mean,
2463440	2467920	one of the, well, I was going to, like I wish I had said, you know, one of the other things
2467920	2473840	that we really valuable to do is to like do the modeling to say, if you do something on TikTok
2473840	2478160	versus you do something in your own community, which what's the carbon there? And you and I
2478160	2482240	both know how that carbon is going to lay out, right? Because just, you know, the question of how
2482240	2489440	much posting on TikTok actually leads to reductions in carbon or more consumption could be maybe,
2489440	2494320	right? Hey, everybody, you know how much I value internet privacy. We have talked about it many
2494320	2499600	times on this show. And that is why I got to give a big shout out to Surfshark for sponsoring

2583440	2587120	You know, I am all about those little pick-me-ups throughout the day. Whether it's conquering
2587120	2592320	work tasks or doing chores around the house, I need a little treat to reward me. It is a must.
2592320	2596720	And you know what gets me smiling every time? Japanese snacks. Not only are they bursting
2596720	2601600	with flavor, but the cute packaging and quirky vibes add an extra layer of fun. That is why
2601600	2606960	teaming up with Bokksu, a Japanese snack subscription box, has been an absolute delight.
2606960	2611520	And these aren't your run-of-the-mill grocery store snacks, okay? Every month, Bokksu brings you
2611520	2617520	over 20 unique treats that you can normally find only in Japan. Plus, they throw in a nifty guide
2617520	2622960	packed with info about each snack and Japanese culture. So you get to snack while you learn?
2622960	2628240	Are you kidding? This was literally made for me. Oh, and by the way, each box ships straight from
2628240	2632000	Japan straight to your door. Okay, so I'm going to try one of the snacks for you. I got my little
2632000	2636960	guide right here. I think this week I'm going to go for the Soka Senbei Uma Zorame. This Senbei
2636960	2642240	rice cracker boasts a uniquely irresistibly tart and sweet flavor combination of Ume Japanese plum
2642240	2647680	and zorame, a coarse granulated sugar. Cool. Now this says it contains wheat and soy, so that's
2647680	2651680	good to know for you gluten folks. There are plenty of gluten-free snacks in here. Here's the
2651680	2660400	cracker. Oh, this looks so good. Let me give it a try. Oh my god. You hear that crunch? It's like
2660400	2666160	tart. It's a little salty. It's a little sweet. It is delicious. And I never would have gotten to try
2666160	2671680	this if Bokksu hadn't sent it straight to my house. And you know, my favorite thing about Bokksu is
2671680	2676800	that they support small, family-run businesses in Japan. Bokksu has sourced your treats by working
2676880	2682160	with over 245 small makers in Japan, helping out their businesses and helping to preserve
2682160	2686960	their traditions. So if you love trying new and interesting things, or if you know somebody who
2686960	2691840	does, you have got to try out Bokksu and get these snacks shipped straight from Japan to your door.

2705200	2712320	to this point of climate shocks, you said, is going to mobilize people. Because you said, actually,
2712320	2715280	let's return to something even earlier. And I didn't even, and I didn't finish talking about
2715280	2720160	what I found. You dropped so many ideas on us. We're going to go through them one by one day.
2721120	2726800	Because this is, you're an incredible interviewee. So you talked about organizations. Organizations
2726800	2731120	are really important to get people, you know, mobilized to make things happen. Something I've
2731120	2735600	talked about before in my work that my wonderful research producer, Sam Roundman, is constantly
2735600	2741360	reminding me. The reason that NRA is very powerful is not actually the gun lobby's money. It's the
2741360	2746400	fact that it's a mass, I mean, the lobby, the money is important, right? But is it's a mass
2746400	2751200	membership organization that like millions of people are members and they actually get something
2751200	2755600	out of the membership. They take firearms training. They, you know, whatever, they get a discount at
2755600	2759840	the local gun store. And they make friends. I mean, that's the other thing is it's not just
2759920	2765120	that they get something out of it, but it creates social bonds and that builds reciprocity so that
2765120	2772000	if they're like, Hey, the library wants to have this, you know, book, you should do something. Oh,
2772000	2776320	yeah, I'm going to come out because it's a real membership organization that people feel like
2776320	2780720	they're a part of. That's also part of why in my own personal experience, unions are so powerful
2780720	2786240	because it is, it's an organization that actually matters to your life. It's about your workplace.
2786240	2791200	It's your workplace connections. You can, you know, exercise power and really feel it. It like
2791200	2794720	is really vital in your life. Churches are really important to people for those reasons.
2794720	2800800	The social bonds, I think some of the problem with organizations like a 350.org like, Hey,
2800800	2803840	why don't you join the climate movement and, you know, come to a thing is it's like,
2803840	2809360	what immediate relevance does that have to people in their lives? Right? Okay. I signed up for a
2809360	2814000	mailing list. You know, maybe they send me some mailers and stuff like that, but it is lacking
2814000	2820000	that like immediacy of this is an organization that I am a part of and that it interacts with my
2820000	2827280	life in multiple ways. So one of the things that I talk about a lot in my last book in American
2827280	2832960	Resistance is the way that there has been this shift in the past like decade or so as social
2832960	2838560	media and technology has diffused more, where a lot of organizations decided, particularly on the
2838560	2842560	left, decided to do the shortcut where they no longer have members, but they have email lists,
2842560	2848320	right? And as a result, individuals will be, you know, members or connected to many different
2848320	2852960	organizations simultaneously, because it's a very easy ask, but they don't get anything out of it.
2852960	2859200	They don't meet in person. They don't actually feel any bonds to anybody else. And I actually in
2859200	2864000	my last book, I talked about how I am, my sister and I went and volunteered with Swing Left during
2864000	2868320	the 2018 election. That was like the last chapter of the book where we went out and we decided we
2868320	2873040	were going to go to, you know, an area in Virginia and we were going to like see, I was like, let's
2873040	2876800	experience this, how this is working, because this was like a big resistance group they'd
2876800	2881600	emerge during the Trump administration to try to push back and to try to help take power back.
2881600	2885760	And so I was like, okay, so my sister and I decided we would do it together. And we went there and
2886400	2890320	while we ended up meeting Terry McAuliffe, who was the former governor and actually ended up
2890320	2895440	running for governor, but did not win in Virginia. So we got to meet him and have a conversation with
2895440	2901360	him. We met nobody else the entire time that we did our work with this organization. And we walked
2901360	2905840	away having done stuff. I got one email saying, Hey, you guys knocked on this many doors this day.
2906400	2909760	And it was amazing because it was like, it was, it was crazy because people were like blocking
2909760	2915120	the street parking to do this in this one area of Virginia to work on this election. But nobody
2915120	2921200	met anybody. So I felt no contact, no connection to this organization afterwards. There's no
2921200	2925760	reciprocity there. What if they had at the end of that said, Hey, let's go out for beers. Hey,
2925760	2929520	the here's Pete, you know, and then you make friends, like, which is something that I've
2929520	2933360	experienced in the labor movement, right, that, that I have, I have new friends and new colleagues,
2933360	2937440	right? You know, I'm literally going to go to a labor conference later this year because I want
2937440	2942240	to meet more people, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, I would say that it's, it's also valuable, like
2942240	2945600	in a you and people are very connected because it's connected to your work and to your life.
2945600	2950400	Exactly. And one of the things that a lot of people have asked me out of the new book is I talk about
2950480	2955680	how we create social reciprocity and how we create resilience in our communities,
2955680	2959120	which is absolutely necessary, right? And so when we think about climate change, and I know
2959120	2962000	we're going to talk about climate shocks in a minute, but when we think about climate change,
2962000	2965760	we know that communities are going to be hit with extreme events, right? Which we call,
2965760	2970960	which I call climate shocks. But we need to address them in terms of thinking about how we
2970960	2975360	environmentally prepare, but we also need to socially prepare. And that's where these kinds
2975440	2980560	of organizations can also play a very important role because as you get hit with an extreme,
2980560	2987920	like an atmospheric river here or a tornado or a hurricane or a drought or a flood or, you know,
2987920	2992800	the list goes on and on and on. Unfortunately, the communities are going to have to respond
2992800	2997520	and having those connections matter a lot. And one of the things that I've been thinking about,
2997520	3000640	and a lot of people have been asking me is where do we get those connections? Because we have many
3000640	3005200	fewer of them on the left, which is what you were pointing out originally. And so we, we know
3005600	3010880	churches, we know other religious groups, we know schools provide that. I mean, certainly
3010880	3016080	one of the ways that Sunrise was so successful is by building hubs within schools. But another
3016080	3019520	place, and this is something that I'm actually starting to do research on and work with in my
3019520	3025120	team at American University, is we're looking at libraries. Libraries are in communities around,
3026320	3029760	in all communities, right? Everybody has a library or almost everybody has a library,
3029760	3034800	thankfully. And they provide information and access to books and knowledge, right? And they
3034880	3038880	could also provide a lot of other things. For example, I mean, I'm assuming here in California,
3038880	3045120	too, libraries help to distribute COVID test kits, right? And they provided a lot of other
3045120	3049440	resources. They provide a lot of social services. Exactly. And they could provide even more. And
3049440	3054240	in fact, one of the things that we're looking into is the way that they might be able to provide
3054240	3059040	information around climate change that is relevant for specific communities based on what
3059040	3063120	the demographics or the community are, as well as the kinds of risks that they're facing.
3063920	3070960	When you talk about these shocks causing, okay, these organizations to grow and maybe
3071600	3077200	have a closer relationship with the public, which is what we need. We need climate organizations
3077200	3084480	that people feel connected to in a more real way so that they can actually ask something of people,
3084480	3087680	hey, show up and do something. And people go, hell, yeah, I will, because I'm a member of this
3087680	3097360	organization. A climate shock, I can see how that might help that happen. Because if your town is
3097360	3102080	flooding, it's suddenly realer to you and you need the help of an organization more. Maybe you'll
3102080	3106640	get more involved in the same way that when if you're being fucked over at work and a union
3106640	3110800	comes to your workplace, you'll feel like you're a member of that union. That's really real. However,
3111520	3114960	if the shocks are happening, doesn't that mean it's kind of late?
3115600	3122720	No, it is a very late hour already for climate change and for the world. And as a result,
3122720	3127440	there's no question that people are going to lose lives and people are going to lose homes.
3127440	3131680	I mean, we're already seeing it. I mean, insurance companies are pulling out of parts of
3131680	3135760	all over the United States. And then that doesn't even consider developing countries which have
3135760	3139760	contributed the least to the climate crisis, but they're being hit even more and they have much
3139760	3145920	less social support. Certain small island nations are flooding. Australia is taking in people who
3145920	3150880	are climate refugees basically. And that's going to happen more and more. But so it is a very late
3150880	3156480	hour, but it's not too late for most of us to save ourselves. And that's why I start in the
3156480	3160560	beginning of the book by saying, I hope to see you all on the other side. Because as much as it
3160560	3165600	sounds kind of glib, I mean, it's absolutely true and we are not taking seriously the threat.
3165600	3169040	And that's one of the reasons that a lot of climate scientists I know are starting, these are like
3169040	3172400	the natural scientists, the atmospheric scientists are becoming activists because they're like,
3172400	3176080	we're done doing research. We're going to scream at the top of our lungs because what the hell else
3176080	3181520	are we going to do? You guys have to listen to us. But nobody's listening to the dire message
3181520	3186000	coming from the scientists. But so with regard to climate shocks, what I think is really important
3186000	3190880	to recognize is that there's a lot of research that talks about how after disasters, windows of
3190880	3196960	opportunity open. And we can see it after Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Sandy. I
3196960	3201360	mean, I know a lot of my examples are hurricanes after the wildfires that hit here in California.
3201360	3208240	There are these moments where all of a sudden people can do things and policy making shifts
3208240	3214000	a lot. And this is what I call an anthro shift in the book. And in that moment, what we see is
3215760	3220560	the social system shift to be able to support people because they know that the people need
3220560	3231040	the help. And that is when we can see the types of systemic changes that are so needed
3231040	3236480	actually happening. Unfortunately, at this point, we don't have examples of that kind of lasting
3236480	3241200	change. And I talk in the book a lot about the example of the pandemic and the way that all of
3241200	3246400	a sudden, when people started feeling the risk themselves, like the risk, oh my gosh, I could
3246480	3250880	die. My kids could die. I could pass on this deadly disease to somebody older in my family.
3251440	3256800	People supported the idea that the world shut down. We stayed home. We homeschooled, which
3256800	3262400	was really fun. We baked bread. We created gardens. We did all of these things at home.
3262400	3267600	We stayed inside for a long time. We wore masks. And people got mad after a while, but especially
3267600	3272640	for the first couple of months, people were really on board. People were vigilant. And our
3272640	3280400	government changed. It supported us. It gave out more resources. It gave loans. It stopped people
3280400	3286720	from getting evicted. It did all of these things. That was an anthra shift. But over time, when the
3286720	3291440	risk level went down and people started being like, oh, I already got it. Wasn't that big deal? Or I
3291440	3298320	got vaccinated? Or it's not worth this? They went back out and we're basically back to normal.
3298320	3302160	And I frequently, when I talk about this, and I'm doing my book tour now and I'm talking to
3302160	3306400	crowds and I'm like, and I see zero people in the audience wearing a mask, even though the pandemic
3306400	3311680	continues, right? That shows that the shift, we went back. It's multi-directional and we can go
3311680	3316160	back. And that tells us how bad it has to get before we're really going to mobilize. I mean,
3316160	3321120	one of the hopeful things just going back to my surveying people in the crowd, back to sociology
3321120	3326160	for a moment. So I surveyed all of these activists in the streets in New York City, 75,000 people in
3326160	3331680	September last year. And I asked them for the first time I asked, one, did you experience a
3331680	3334800	climate shock? And I didn't say climate shock. I listed a whole bunch of things that we know are
3334800	3340160	climate shocks. Wildfire and smoke from wildfire, extreme weather, extreme events, sea level rise,
3340160	3346960	flooding, right? And what was amazing is over 85% of the people in the crowd reported experiencing
3346960	3351840	at least one climate shock in the past six months. Wow. I mean, in a lot of it, so we were on the
3351840	3356640	East Coast, a lot of it was wildfire and smoke from wildfire, but also sea level rise, flooding,
3356640	3362240	and extreme heat, right? So this is, I mean, so the people who are mobilizing are experiencing
3362240	3367280	climate shocks. And the other thing that I asked them is there's been a lot of talk about emotions
3367280	3372720	and people feeling like climate anxiety or feeling so despondent from the crisis that
3372720	3376160	they're not doing anything. And so one of the things I wanted to do is see what people in the
3376160	3380640	streets were feeling, what is motivating them to get out in the streets and get off their sofas,
3380640	3389440	right? And the top emotions for people in the crowd were sadness, makes sense, right? And anger.
3389440	3392880	No hope. People in the streets were not particularly hopeful. They were there because
3392880	3397520	they were pissed off. Yeah. And there is like historical precedent that we know that people
3397520	3402480	who join social movements and like are willing to take a stand, they usually are angry. So,
3402480	3408720	you know, come to think of it, hope, especially in the Obama era, got such a big, big reputation.
3408720	3412240	Oh, hope, hope. That's why we're out there. Well, hold on a second. If you have hope,
3412240	3415040	maybe you'll just sit at home and be like, yeah, hope things will get better. Like,
3416160	3418240	things will probably turn around. Exactly.
3418240	3422400	Don't worry about it. But if you're pissed off, you might take to the streets and like,
3422400	3424880	you know, start shaking your fist and throwing things.
3424880	3428480	Absolutely. And you might be willing to glue yourself or get arrested, right? I mean,
3428480	3434160	a good piece of evidence on that point is that while we did the survey in the streets,
3434160	3438240	I also worked with a team of folks who did a nationally representative sample of people who
3438240	3443040	were not in the streets at the same time to see how much they experienced climate shocks
3443040	3449440	and what emotions they were feeling. And so they had a lot less experience personally with climate
3449440	3456960	shocks and they were hopeful about the climate change. So people who were not in the streets
3456960	3463440	are hopeful and less angry and people who are in the streets less hopeful, angry, but they're there.
3463440	3472080	That is so fascinating because I have taken as a thesis for a long time that, look, there's such
3472080	3478480	a vibe out there of the world is ending, right? It's all over. If you scroll on TikTok, you'll
3478480	3483920	see a lot of people who feel that way. Well, hey, this is the, I'm a member of the last generation.
3483920	3489280	So why even bother? And I always sort of took it as a given that part of, you know,
3489280	3494880	what I should try to do is let people know that there's always going to be a world tomorrow
3494880	3499600	and you always have the opportunity to make a better tomorrow and shit is being done and you
3499600	3506000	can be a part of that and to try to fight against defeatism, which I think is part of hope and to
3506000	3511040	try to cultivate a bit of hope. Things are really bad. I want us to be real realists, but hey,
3511040	3516720	if we can do it, what you are maybe saying is that maybe that's the wrong approach. Maybe we
3516720	3522080	should just say, nah, shit's fucked. Get mad. Get out there. I don't think that they're that
3522080	3525760	different. I mean, I actually, because I actually think when I hear you talking about it, I mean,
3525760	3530160	like you kind of sound like an apocalyptic optimist too, right? I mean, I mean, it's basically,
3530160	3534960	that's the realistic stance, right? Is that, I mean, if you want to be realistic about the climate
3534960	3539200	crisis, you need to acknowledge what the natural scientists are saying. I mean, I'm not a natural
3539200	3544480	scientist. I'm not an atmospheric scientist. We got a lot of my colleagues who are who are saying,
3544480	3549280	we are standing at the precipice and we are looking into it. And some of us are saying,
3549280	3553920	who cares? And others of us are saying, holy shit, I mean, and those people are doing something
3553920	3559360	about it. And in, you know, in the case of the general public, I think it's important to recognize
3559360	3564960	that so that when we hit like summer 2024 is going to suck. It is going to suck across the
3564960	3569520	country. And anybody who says differently, and then it's going to go into fall 2024,
3569520	3574880	and they are predicting the worst hurricane, the worst hurricane season ever. I mean, and the
3574880	3579920	only, I mean, if anybody is wondering about why we know that, look at the temperature, ocean
3579920	3584960	temperatures now, ocean temperatures are statistically significantly off the charts
3584960	3589600	from any historical record. And that, and that leads to hurricanes, right?
3589600	3592880	Because the energy in the ocean, that leads to energy in the storm system.
3592880	3596640	Yeah. I mean, basically the storms like suck up the water and the warmer the water is,
3596640	3602160	the more water they suck up. And so while the hurricanes, the wind may not be any stronger,
3602160	3607840	it is not the wind that destroys homes and destroys communities. It is how much rain falls.
3607840	3611120	I mean, you guys know that here, right? It's all about rainfall and how much
3611120	3615200	your land can actually absorb, right? And that, and that is going to be
3615200	3619920	absolutely decimating this coming year. So we need to be realistic about that, right? And I,
3619920	3623520	I mean, I don't do that research, but I believe my colleagues who do do that research.
3623520	3627280	And so the question is, what do we do about it? And I do think we should be hopeful. I mean,
3627280	3632320	I'm hopeful, but the reason I'm hopeful is because I'm angry. And because I know so many people are
3632320	3636960	angry. And I think that people should not sit with it and be like, you know, you should be like,
3636960	3641040	wow, this sucks. And it's getting worse. But they, but we should also think,
3641840	3645120	and fuck it, I'm going to do something about it. And, and that's what everybody needs to do.
3645120	3650320	People need to rise up and they need to, they need to embrace the anchor and embrace the fact that
3650320	3655600	this is not fair. And it is not fair that it is our responsibility to do something about it. The
3655600	3660720	only way that our government will do what is needed is if we demand it and we force them to.
3660720	3666640	Otherwise, we will continue on this incremental path to policy making that will do something,
3666640	3671440	but absolutely not enough to address the climate crisis. And basically, you may as well kiss like
3671440	3677120	half of Florida goodbye. You may as well kiss most of the coast, you know, goodbye. And anybody who
3677120	3682640	lives in areas that get extreme heat, like, you know, the whole Southwest, anybody who works
3682640	3687760	outside there, anybody who can't afford to have air conditioning, they'll be moving. And, you know,
3687760	3692720	then we're going to be experiencing not just internal migration, but, you know, within the
3692720	3696640	United States, but we're going to be seeing all these people from other parts of the world who
3696640	3701920	can't, you know, can't live where they are, who have, you know, no access to water. It's too hot.
3701920	3706240	They can't survive. And they're going to be pushing in. And of course, that makes for a really fun
3706240	3710880	story because, as we know, we're not doing so well with migration already. Now imagine all the
3710880	3713920	people who are going to be coming. And the political strife that will come as a result
3713920	3719840	when people freak out about that and the humanitarian crisis that will happen. And my God.
3720800	3729120	But don't get despondent. Get angry. That's a great message. I, I, no, no, seriously,
3729120	3734320	I'm the angry sociologist. That's a wonderful, it's a wonderful message and a wonderful speech
3734320	3742400	that you gave. I hope you could speak to my own darkest thought, which is that, you know, on some
3742400	3749600	level humanity, like our social technology, our social ability to recognize what's happening as a
3749600	3757440	system of humans. And honestly, our individual ability to do so is sort of outstripped by what is
3757440	3762480	happening. You know, I, something that stuck with me for a long time, I read this maybe a year ago.
3762560	3766160	Can't remember whose blog post this was. So apologies to the blogger who wrote this,
3766160	3772640	but it was that, you know, Obama had bought a beachfront home on Martha's, Martha's Village.
3772640	3775600	Martha's Vineyard. Martha's Vineyard. Thank you, the island, right? That he loves so much.
3775600	3780880	You are a west coaster. No, no, no, I'm not a prop. No, I grew up in New York, goddammit,
3780880	3786640	but I just forgot what it was. Oh, I have a tan now. Okay, fuck it. I mean, I live in California.
3787280	3791440	Anyway, so he had bought a, he had bought a house on Martha's Vineyard and whatever
3791520	3796880	reporter or blogger this was looked up like, you know, the government's climate change predictions.
3796880	3802320	It was like, this house is going to be unlivable or unsellable inside of 20 years, right? That this
3802320	3808800	is like a terrible investment. Forget livable. It's a bad investment. And literally, I know people,
3808800	3812480	I grew up on Long Island, I know people who have had that problem where it's like their house has
3812480	3816320	gone down in value because, you know, it's so close to the coast that people don't want to buy it
3816320	3819920	because they know about climate change. After Hurricane Sandy, there were communities that had
3819920	3826240	to be relocated. I mean, yeah. So the point of this piece was that Barack Obama, who certainly
3826240	3830880	should be in a better position than anyone else to know about climate change, very smart man reads
3830880	3836400	a giant briefing book every weekend, you know, he's not ignorant of the problem. And yet when it came
3836400	3844240	to his own personal choice, he made a choice that was ignorant because our own ability to sort of
3844240	3850160	see the future in this case and think about how it affects us is limited, right? It's like a human
3850160	3854000	limitation. And I could list, I don't want to just be like, Obama's a piece of shit. That's not the
3854000	3858560	point. The point is that like all of us do this to an extent, right? Like we have trouble
3859280	3865040	thinking about the future in this way and making adjustments in our lives and then multiply that
3865040	3870400	by, you know, eight billion. And, you know, you've got a real motherfucker of a problem. And this is
3870400	3874000	just going to be something we're 200 years from now. The remnants of humanity are looking back
3874000	3879760	going. This was just outstripped our ability to do something as a species.
3880400	3885040	Okay. So first and foremost, yes, I think there is a real risk of that. But second, I do want to,
3885040	3888800	I want to talk about the Obama issue and the example for a second to just say that, well,
3890480	3894880	well, Obama should have known better. However, he is, I mean, he's a super privileged man, right?
3894880	3899760	He's a former president of the United States. He has lots of resources. His, you know,
3899840	3904960	Michelle has made a lot of money on selling books, right? So they are not suffering at all. Okay.
3904960	3909680	So they can afford it. I mean, the people who can afford it, I mean, they may take a loss.
3909680	3914720	They can afford to take a loss. And at this point, I mean, it's unclear what will happen with insurance
3914720	3918720	on Martha's Vineyard and in, you know, in Massachusetts. If they were in Florida,
3918720	3921520	they would no longer have insurance. And you know what? Someone's going to buy this house,
3921520	3924640	even if it's like floating in the ocean. Someone's going to be like, you know,
3924640	3927120	President Obama used to live there. Someone's going to pay too much for it.
3927120	3931840	I mean, what maybe, but I mean, what's happening right now is that there are certain communities
3931840	3936080	and there was this really interesting story that was done in Washington Post recently about
3936080	3942000	communities in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where there were the summer houses that basically
3942800	3946560	had, you know, where Outer Banks are like these border islands, right? And they had been
3947120	3952960	so taken over by sea level rise that they basically were no longer able to get access to
3952960	3957040	water, sewage or electricity, right? Because that all came underground and all got washed away.
3957920	3963520	So the National Park Service paid the owners, and I believe it was $800,000 a house
3964160	3967280	to take them back and demolish them. Wow.
3967280	3972400	Which is, that's just like, that's not sustainable. It's outrageous a little bit. And you know,
3974000	3979440	and those people like, I know they took a loss, but you know, hey, that's not so bad. I mean,
3979440	3982800	we should all hope that we get that kind of bailout. That's not, we should not expect that to
3982800	3987680	happen. But so, I mean, so I would just say like, I think, you know, those people who can afford
3987680	3992640	summer homes and stuff like that, and I mean, more and more, they're going to buy homes without
3992640	3996720	being able to get insurance because that's what's happening is the insurance companies are on the
3996720	4000720	forefront or the Vanguard in terms of thinking about this because it's their pocketbook that's
4000720	4003920	going back to cover. And the people in that position of privilege are the ones who are calling the
4003920	4008240	shots. They're the ones who are running the oil companies. They're the ones who are senators and
4008240	4012400	et cetera, right? Right. I mean, for now, I mean, the nice, you know, that's one of the things that's
4012400	4018800	nice about our country is you could actually run for office and hold office and not come from like
4018800	4025040	oil companies. But you know, people have to, but it's much more difficult. I saw a stat recently
4025040	4030240	from, I believe, more Perfect Union that like a very small percentage of people in office are from
4030240	4034000	working class backgrounds. Most of them are well paid lawyers and things like that. They're from
4034000	4037360	the upper crust. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let me share. So those, I mean, and those people are
4037360	4041840	going to have the least, they're the least at risk from the climate crisis, right? They are not part
4041840	4046560	of frontline communities. They are not, most of them don't come from communities of color either.
4046560	4052560	And that means that they have like some distance from experiencing this. But I mean, but I think
4052560	4057040	that the other point that you made in this, the example around Obama that I think is really important
4057040	4063600	to think about is that because of the way climate change works, which is right right now, we emit
4063600	4068320	CO2, carbon greenhouse gases, they go into the atmosphere and they build up there.
4068320	4072800	And it is the process of them getting up there and sitting up there that then affects
4072800	4076560	thermal radiation coming from the sun and how much actually gets back out. And that's,
4076560	4081120	that's the greenhouse effect, right? That's how it works. And that then has this effect on all
4081120	4085440	these patterns, et cetera, that the natural scientists are talking about. It is a slow process,
4085440	4090400	right? We know, for example, if tomorrow everybody stopped burning fossil fuels and
4090400	4095840	everybody, you know, everybody just turned off the lights, we would not see an effect in terms of
4096560	4100960	all of the effects of climate change. The climate shocks would not stop immediately.
4100960	4106320	So given that delay, it makes it even harder. Not only is that we've got these folks in positions
4106320	4111360	of power who are controlling all the resources that are making decisions, making slow, but it's
4111360	4116560	also that it's like a, it's, there's a delay there. And that means that this is such a tricky problem
4116560	4121520	that there is just no question in my mind that we are going to have to get a lot more apocalyptic
4121520	4126960	before we're going to get to the optimistic side. Because we need people to experience this first
4126960	4132320	hand to get angry enough to make those kinds of decisions to change their behaviors. And a lot
4132320	4136720	of those decisions and those changes, they're not going to be fun. I mean, some people will be able
4136720	4142000	to buy a Rivian. Congratulations to you, right? But most people were talking about having to
4142000	4147680	take public transit and hope that it becomes electrified. And that is, you know, having tried,
4147680	4152160	right, like, you know, having tried to get around on public transit here in LA, I can tell you,
4152160	4157280	it sucks. I do it every day. Oh, well, it's, it's, look, if you, if you plan it that way, right,
4157280	4161360	you plan it that way. I plan it that way. I've, I've molded my life around public transit in LA
4161360	4166320	and go to, go to a major city in Texas and tell me that public transit in LA sucks. Like, at least
4166320	4171440	we fucking have it here. I'm, I'm serious. Like, like Los Angeles has second highest public transit
4171440	4177280	ridership in the country, because, because there are buses, a lot of cities in America do not have
4177280	4183360	them at all. But, you know, I saw speed. I know about the buses. Well taken that like you, it is,
4183360	4190080	the system is simultaneously, you know, to, to spread out buses run too rarely, too uncomfortable,
4190080	4194160	not enough shade, speaking of climate change, you know, there are all these problems with the
4194160	4198080	system. And they're not electric. Yeah. And they're not electric. Makes it far more uncomfortable
4198720	4203120	and unpleasant and inconvenient to ride than it should be, despite the fact that it's a better
4203120	4210800	option than many, than many people, you know, in this city think that it is. But so you, but it
4210800	4216880	almost seems like you end up not rooting for the shocks, but saying like, Hey, things are going to
4216880	4223840	get worse. But in a way, that's a good thing because it may finally cause the societal response
4223920	4229040	that we need, where people are really fucking getting out there and getting angry and saying,
4229040	4234160	protect us because we are actively dying. Right. I mean, and that, but that unfortunately, that
4234160	4239760	process is the only way I see it working. Right. Because the government's not going to step in
4239760	4243920	and save us because they're basically going to lose, I mean, the folks in power are going to lose
4243920	4248160	those funders who fund their campaigns. And that's how our political system works, unfortunately.
4248160	4252160	But that is how the system works, right? So that's not going to change. The business is,
4252160	4255680	some of the businesses are going to push for clean energy, but a whole bunch of businesses
4255680	4260320	are going to say, Hey, we can, maybe we can extract a more natural gas and send it to other
4260320	4265120	countries and make money on that. So they're going to do anything they can to stay, stay the
4265120	4270160	course. So systemic change is hard. We're going to have to push for it. And it is true that we're
4270160	4275200	going to need to have, I mean, I'm not rooting for climate shocks. I am being just realistic
4275200	4279760	about what's coming. I mean, I just hope there are some people, some scholars who are talking
4279760	4284960	about these like cascading effects and not knowing how it's going to have huge effects on
4286480	4291120	in terms of thinking about how weather patterns will change, how the different ocean currents
4291120	4296480	will change. And I mean, this is all people who do stuff that I do not do and I don't know a lot
4296480	4302080	about, but I read when I see the story, the pieces come out in top journals, those things could really
4302080	4308320	change the whole way that weather and temperature and climate works all over the world. And we don't
4308320	4314080	know. I mean, it could mean like droughts happen in places that never were dry before and floods,
4314080	4318000	you know, and places are inundated in ways that were never before. But we should expect that
4318560	4322880	these kinds of things are coming. So I just, my feeling is we just should take whatever is
4322880	4328720	predicted and assume that it could be as bad as that. And we can hope it won't be. But that is
4328720	4333120	where people are going to start to get angry because it's when you have the personal experience
4333520	4341440	of the risk that gets us mad and gets us motivated. And then we work through the organizations that
4341440	4346960	exist or build our own organizations to put pressure on those in power. And it's only when
4346960	4351680	those in power actually feel at risk of losing power that they finally make a difference.
4351680	4354400	And they make the changes that are needed. And that means we learn this from the civil
4354400	4360080	rights movement. Those are perfect examples there. I mean, you actually are giving me hope that
4361040	4366960	it's weird. You give me a weird kind of hope that like as things get worse, that creates the
4366960	4373280	conditions for things to get better, that there's a natural sort of countervailing force. And that
4373280	4377120	honestly sounds more plausible to me than like, Hey, you know, the price of solar is going to get
4377120	4380640	so cheap that eventually the problem is going to solve itself. Like I can, I can hold that a
4380640	4384800	little bit of hope there too. But also, you know, I think things are getting a little bit worse.
4384880	4391040	But the idea that that is going to, you know, cause change and cause a mass uprising of the
4391040	4397280	sort that we need is believable. And it seems to be, you know, born out by history that, you know,
4397280	4403520	it's when people are under the most intense pressure that I mean, look at the labor movement,
4403520	4409760	right? That like the labor movement was born out of the incredible depravity of the late 19th
4409760	4416080	century, right? The incredible misery forced people to stand up and fight back. And then,
4416080	4420080	you know, we, the labor movement worked and, you know, in, you know, starting in the middle
4420080	4424160	part of the century or the last century, we had the rise of the middle class and like safety
4424160	4428800	protections and the 40 hour work week and all these things. And then everybody got comfy and
4428800	4433040	the company started fucking everybody again. And now people are rising up again. Like this is
4433040	4438640	kind of how it works a little bit. And so, you know, we're starting to have the fact that the
4438640	4442880	climate crisis is actually happening, is waking people up perhaps.
4442880	4446400	Well, yeah, certainly. I mean, there's no question that the labor movement is also
4446400	4453200	reemerging after recognizing how the extension and expansion of inequality in our country is
4453200	4457520	basically leaving so many people behind, right? So that's happening simultaneous.
4457520	4462000	And one of the things that simultaneously, one of the things I talk about in the book, though,
4462000	4467360	is that historically, labor and the climate movement have not worked well together. I mean,
4467360	4472000	and in fact, part of that is because much of the clean energy transition so far has been
4472000	4477120	peopled by non-union labor. And that means that folks in unions are like, no, no, no, no, no,
4477120	4480960	we would like to stick with our fossil fuel expansion project because that is unionized.
4480960	4484320	And there have been some, I won't, I won't call them out, but there's been a couple
4484320	4488080	unions I know here in Southern California that have been like against, you know,
4488080	4492000	different climate change regulations. Hey, let's electrify. Well, hold on a second.
4492000	4494160	If you work in the gas industry, maybe you don't like that so much.
4494160	4500240	Of course. Of course. And that's understandable, but it is, you know, it is against, it's people
4500240	4505120	following their incentives as one does, but it is bad in the overall.
4505120	4510080	The good news is things are shifting. I mean, for example, there was one,
4510080	4514320	there's one really interesting case that happened recently where so for people who build cars that
4514320	4518800	are fossil fuel burning cars, most of those factories are union labor, right?
4518800	4519200	Yeah.
4519200	4523360	The folks who build the batteries for electric cars historically have not been union labor.
4523760	4528960	And so if you want to push for more EVs, you're pushing away from using union labor.
4528960	4532480	But there is, there are now efforts and there's some really good people who are working on trying
4532480	4538160	to, you know, work together to unionize consistently so that that is not, you know,
4538160	4540960	that is not the challenge of the worker because it's not really fair.
4540960	4544320	And because that is really necessary to help to merge these movements together.
4544320	4548800	And a far-sighted union leader would need to see that as I think some in the auto industry are
4548800	4551760	finally. Yeah, they're finally starting to do that. And I think that's going to continue. I mean,
4551760	4555520	I would just say that, you know, the other reason that we don't, we shouldn't have a lot of hope
4555520	4561360	so far about the clean energy transition is that so far we've seen an expansion in consumption
4561360	4565440	of clean energy in the United States, thanks to a lot of federal funding from the Inflation
4565440	4570160	Reduction Act, et cetera. And the price of, you know, renewable and clean energy has gone down
4570160	4574800	quite a bit. But what's happened is actually our overall energy to consumption has just grown.
4574800	4575040	Yeah.
4575040	4579280	So we continue to still burn and consume as much fossil fuels, but more, there's more.
4579760	4586400	The percentage is better, but the actual, a literal amount of fossil fuels being burned has
4586400	4589680	not gone down. And that's why the carbon concentrations continue to go up.
4590400	4594960	So you said earlier, it was almost a good way to end the podcast, but I had more I wanted to ask
4594960	4601360	you. You remember before when you were like, get angry and get out there, right? How should people
4601360	4607680	do that? Like how should people, you know, join the movement if we would like to make sure we don't
4607680	4611600	need quite so many climate shocks before we do something, right? We want to get started early
4611600	4615440	so that we have to go through less of those. What do people do?
4615440	4622560	Yeah, that's exactly the argument that I make is that the more people reclaim their power and
4622560	4627440	mobilize and start working together, the less climate shocks will happen and the less people
4627440	4633120	will lose life and lose like their livelihoods, right? Because that's basically where we're going.
4633120	4638320	So, I mean, the book ends with three points, three things that we can all do to save ourselves.
4638320	4641280	And two of them are for people who want to be activists. And one is for, you know,
4641280	4645280	your everyday people. So I'll just talk to the activists first. I'm first and foremost,
4645280	4649280	and this is actually building off of what we were just talking about. Activists need to create
4649280	4655520	community and true solidarity. And the solidarity needs to come across movements, across different
4655520	4660320	issues. I mean, we need to see more intersectionality. We need to see more people coming from all
4660320	4664960	different identities and orientations engaging in climate activism. Historically, the climate
4664960	4669520	movement which spun off of the environmental movement was really quite privileged. And as such,
4669520	4674480	we did not see a lot of people of color or people coming from working class backgrounds
4674480	4679360	involved in it. We still don't enough, but we need to see that happen more. And one of the things
4679360	4683760	in terms of thinking about creating community and building community within the movement,
4683760	4689520	I think is really interesting, is I talk about in the book a lot lessons from the civil rights
4689520	4693040	movement. And one of the things, and I talk a lot in the book about kind of this growing radical
4693040	4698080	flank of folks who are starting to be more aggressive, even though it's like air quote
4698080	4703680	aggressive at this point, in that they're being confrontational, throwing soup on plastic covers
4703680	4708160	and, you know, gluing themselves to things or disrupting the US Open and then getting
4708160	4712320	carted away in the US Open continues, right? So I mean, sure, it's a nuisance, but we're
4712320	4716880	not talking like this isn't radical like the suffragettes who blew up like a building a month
4716960	4720640	the height of women's suffrage, you know, the struggle for women's suffrage. So,
4720640	4725200	you know, it's still quite tame radical. But when we talk about the radical flank, like everybody
4725200	4728640	doesn't have to be involved in the radical flank. When we think about creating community, one of
4728640	4732560	the things that's a really interesting lesson from the civil rights movement is that during the
4732560	4736960	civil rights struggle, a radical flank also emerged, right, where people were becoming more
4736960	4741680	confrontational and they engaged in sit-ins and they engaged in, you know, the blockades and,
4741680	4745200	you know, it continues from there. Everybody probably knows some of the stories about that.
4745520	4750320	But what's very interesting about it is that the, as a radical flank, which was mostly young
4750320	4755280	people during the civil rights period, emerged, a lot of the elders who were active in the movement
4755280	4760160	were not happy with this. These young people who were starting to be more radical, breaking laws,
4760160	4764000	they were, you know, risking themselves also because, you know, there was a lot of racism
4764000	4769120	in our country. Even then there was racism, right? Let me say that differently. Back then,
4769120	4773360	there was racism, but it's worth noting that, you know, racism continues today in our country.
4774320	4781360	But so even though the elders were not happy with this, the Black churches created a home for
4781360	4785920	these activists and created a space for them to organize and created resources to bail people
4785920	4791520	out of jail, et cetera. And it is that kind of community that created support and this kind
4791520	4796000	of organizational infrastructure for activists, no matter whether they were being, you know,
4796000	4802240	doing more legally oriented work and focusing on trying to get the vote through institutional
4802240	4805440	channels or they were out in the streets causing, you know, good trouble, right?
4805440	4809520	That's what people call a diversity of tactics, right? And there was solidarity between all the
4809520	4814080	people who were pursuing the, hey, I don't know if I like you, what you were doing, but you know
4814080	4817360	what? I'll bail you out of jail or I'll make sure we're on the same side still.
4817360	4820960	They were on the same side. I mean, they were still like the solidarity was, there was solidarity,
4820960	4825040	but they argued. I mean, certainly, and there were factions and they didn't agree all the time.
4825040	4828640	And, you know, and they didn't, you know, everybody had their opinion, right? So it was,
4828640	4835120	it was an uncomfortable coalition to some degree, but it was also all rooted in the Black community
4835120	4840560	and within the Black churches. And so they really had a lot more organizational infrastructure
4840560	4845200	than the groups do today. And as we were talking about, that is really necessary and important.
4845200	4849040	So building that through community and solidarity is valuable. That was number one.
4849040	4855520	Number two is taking advantage of moral shocks and capitalizing on violence against activists.
4855520	4858880	And this is really, we haven't talked that much about civil disobedience.
4858880	4863200	Civil disobedience is becoming a more common tactic among activists. I mean,
4864800	4869920	well, I'm going to just say like everybody has heard of Greta Thunberg and Greta just got arrested
4869920	4875440	again in the Netherlands last week. She is a perfect example. And I talk about her quite a bit
4875440	4881600	in the book because she started out doing this very kind of very, you know, simple tactic where
4881600	4885840	she was just sitting on the parliament steps, right, holding her sign and skipping school,
4885840	4890240	right? It was not confrontational. And she has become increasingly confrontational and she has
4890240	4894400	basically become part of the radical flank of the climate movement. So her personal trajectory is
4894400	4899040	like a really good example because we're seeing that for activists around the country and around
4899040	4904400	the world, right? But what's interesting is that many people then say, oh, these activists,
4904400	4907920	they're going to get violent. There's very little reason to believe they're going to get violent.
4907920	4911760	What is much more likely, and I talk at length about this in the book, is that people are going
4911760	4916640	to get violent against them. They are going to be repressed by law enforcement. I mean,
4916640	4920000	we're seeing that, we're seeing a little bit of that in the United States. We're seeing that more
4920000	4924240	and more around the world. But we also should expect that there are going to be counter movements
4924240	4928880	that will rise up and be aggressive and violent against the activists. And it is an unfortunate
4928880	4933120	reality. But it happened during the George Floyd movement, right? Exactly. Where you had the police
4933120	4937520	violently attacking protesters and then you had vigilantes showing up with guns and shooting people
4938400	4942640	and saying, oh, that's because the protesters are violent. Exactly. So that is, that's a
4942640	4946800	wonderful example. I mean, the other thing worth noting here is, and I talk in the book about
4946800	4952720	the moment when President Trump basically had all of these peaceful protesters tear gassed in
4952720	4958000	Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., for his photo opportunity. But the thing is that,
4958000	4964000	and this is a perfect example of how activists can capitalize on violence, is that these were
4964000	4968480	nonviolent protesters and members of the media who got tear gassed and they were, you know,
4968480	4975200	they were harmed physically and they drew attention to this. And the protests the next day was like
4975200	4980560	twice the size. Yeah. And that is how it works, capitalizing on these moral shocks and the violence.
4980560	4983840	I mean, and there are other examples from the civil rights movement where we saw, you know,
4983840	4987520	dogs called on activists, people beaten up, et cetera. And so for that just list goes on.
4987520	4992080	Those are the iconic moments of that movement. Exactly. And those were the moments when people
4992080	4998400	who were sympathizers to the movement mobilized in solidarity. And it is those moments of solidarity.
4998400	5005280	I mean, George Floyd, the moment when we saw the protests after George Floyd was murdered
5005280	5009680	were moments of solidarity. And one of the reasons we saw so many people, white people
5009680	5014080	in the crowd and people who were coming out because of their intersectional motivations
5014080	5018960	is because they were not willing to sit down after observing and witnessing an unarmed black
5018960	5024000	man being murdered by a policeman on social media, right? So that was like a moral shock
5024000	5032560	that motivated people and they got angry, right? Yeah. But so that's number two and number three.
5032560	5036560	And finally, and this is for people who don't want to do activism. You do not have to be an
5036560	5041520	activist to help us save ourselves, right? You can be just an everyday citizen. And that's the
5041520	5046560	final one, which is about cultivating resilience. And as I said before, when I talk about resilience,
5046560	5051600	this is about building our communities so that they can withstand the climate shocks that are
5051600	5057520	coming and come they will, right? So we know they're coming. And depending on where you live,
5057520	5064320	you know what you're in for, whether it is extreme heat or extreme weather, atmospheric rivers,
5064320	5071360	tornadoes, etc. When those things hit, first of all, we need to rebuild in ways that we can handle
5071360	5075280	that more because we know they're going to keep coming. Places that experience sea level rise,
5075280	5079760	you need to make sure that your community is capable of handling flooding, the kind of flooding
5079760	5083840	that's going to become regular. I mean, and hopefully the flooding that will not overpower
5083840	5088560	your community. But still, there are things you can do. So you need to be environmentally resilient,
5088560	5092800	but more importantly, I would say, we need to be socially resilient. I mean, I've been talking
5092800	5098160	with a lot of groups that are working on disasters and they keep telling me about how
5099200	5104160	what they basically have been funded to do mostly is what they call disaster response.
5104160	5108800	And that is like the number one thing that a disaster response is, is it's mucking and gutting,
5108800	5115120	which is really, really not glamorous work at all, right? Mucking and gutting out after floods,
5115120	5121120	after fires, etc. That is the response. But the problem is that you need to also think about the
5121120	5126240	recovery, right? And recovery is rebuilding in a way where your community is more resilient. And
5126240	5130480	when you do that, you really need people to be connected to one another so that those who get
5130480	5136160	on house have support. Those who need food, those who need resources, etc., those who need jobs because
5136160	5140000	their place of work no longer exists because it gets just washed away or burnt down.
5140560	5144560	And so the resilience is really important. And that's something that we can all do by getting
5144560	5149200	more connected and embedded in our communities, be it through our local unions, be it through our,
5149200	5155200	you know, whatever religious groups there are or our schools or our libraries, right?
5155920	5160320	I mean, I love it. It's such a holistic vision of like how we can
5161840	5166080	save ourselves, save ourselves the title of your book. I mean, it's a huge task,
5166080	5170880	but it's like, that's all, all we can fucking do is to, is to do this. Like we have to do it.
5170880	5176160	We have to do it. We will do it. I mean, like I'm an optimist, right? We will do it. The question is
5176160	5180640	how bad is it going to get before we do it. And hopefully it won't be too late for most of us.
5180640	5185200	I mean, I really believe, I believe in people power. I believe we can do it, but I believe we
5185200	5191840	need to all embrace the anger and get involved. I mean, people power got us here, right? Literally
5191840	5196640	fossil fuels are people power. It's a kind of power that we fucking came up with. We created the
5196640	5202000	problem. We have the power to fix it. We are the only ones who are going to fix it. And we're the,
5202000	5205120	you know, that kind of, the kind of power you're talking about is the only kind of power that's
5205120	5210240	ever done fucking anything. Yeah. I mean, and as, as I say, the last line of the book is actually,
5210240	5215120	as unfair as it seems, nobody's coming to save us. We're going to have to save ourselves.
5215120	5219760	And so this is, this is the opportunity, but this is the moment now where it still can really matter.
5219760	5222640	Yeah. It will matter in the end, but it'll matter more now. So.
5222640	5227520	And that's such an opportunity. I mean, look, I, I'm as angry as anybody. I can't believe we have
5227520	5234560	to fuck, you know, Greta Thunberg going like, I'm a child. I'm a child. Like, yeah, no, we get it.
5234560	5240160	But yet, you know, this is the position that we are in, and we can see it as an opportunity to
5240160	5245280	have a huge effect on the world around us by, by stepping up and doing these things.
5245280	5248960	Absolutely. I mean, one final thing I would just say is that, you know, there are lots of young
5248960	5255760	people who are just angry and upset and, you know, I feel the same way that Greta did. And she did
5255760	5259840	that night, that iconic speech, right? One thing that I think is really nice to see though, is that
5259840	5263840	we see all of these, what we're calling them, like the climate elders, the climate grannies
5263920	5269280	who are coming out and are basically setting an example and are providing support for young
5269280	5274720	people and working in, you know, working with them in, you know, solidarity. We've got the,
5274720	5280080	like, rocking chair rebellion. We've got all of these amazing elders who are also joining the
5280080	5286160	movement. So it's not all on young people. And I think we just need to, you know, support everybody
5286160	5290560	who is doing everything they can to save ourselves because it's going to take all of us.
