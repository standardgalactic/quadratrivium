0	2600	Hello and welcome to Factually, I'm Adam Conover.
2600	4600	Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.
4600	6800	You know, you may have noticed that I spend a lot of time
6800	9000	talking shit about the wealthy on this show,
9000	10320	how they hoard their wealth,
10320	12120	go to war against their own workers,
12120	14560	and are in the process of destroying the planet
14560	16980	all to protect their precious golden treasure.
16980	19400	And I think a lot of you might feel the same way.
19400	23200	That might be why you watch this show and you're not alone.
23200	26440	The American economy has gotten more and more unfair
26440	29520	and frankly fucked up over the past 50 years
29520	32000	and people have taken notice.
32000	33640	You don't need to be an economist
33640	34960	to know that there's something bad
34960	38680	about the top 10% of a society hoarding 2 thirds of its wealth
38680	41640	or about a country where wages since 1979
41640	45000	have grown over five times faster for the top 1%
45000	47220	than for the bottom 90%.
47220	49220	As a result, in recent years,
49220	52120	we have seen left-leaning social movements coalesce
52120	53960	in order to fight this injustice.
53960	56200	First, during the Occupy Wall Street movement,
56200	59080	then in the 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders
59080	60960	and more recently in the emergence of groups
60960	63280	like the Democratic Socialists of America,
63280	65520	the word socialism is now a part
65520	68160	of our political conversation in a way it simply wasn't
68160	71680	in 2008 or 2000 or 1992.
71680	73040	But while that's true,
73040	76200	it still hasn't fully entered our political mainstream.
76200	78280	You haven't seen a lot of socialist senators
78280	80660	or even many members of the house yet.
80660	82240	And here's the really weird part.
82240	86400	The same is not true for the far right of our politics.
86400	89000	I mean, the current GOP presidential candidate
89000	91880	is open about wanting to cut the modest social safety net
91880	94720	we do have, reducing social security and Medicare,
94720	96840	lowering taxes on the rich incorporations
96840	98980	and gutting environmental regulations,
98980	101280	all while enacting a wildly regressive,
101280	103360	frankly fascist social agenda
103360	104920	that will reduce the rights for women
104920	106940	and target immigrants for deportation.
106940	108720	I mean, I will grant that Bernie Sanders
108720	110440	is very popular for a socialist
110440	112160	in the context of American history,
112160	114600	but there simply isn't a Bernie army
114600	117000	the same way there is a MAGA army.
117000	119640	There are a hundred times as many elected MAGA leaders
119640	122040	as socialists in American government today.
122040	125840	Despite all of the left successes, why is that?
125840	127320	Well, to answer that question,
127320	129280	we have an incredible guest on the show today.
129280	130240	Before we get into it though,
130240	132320	I wanna remind you that if you wanna support this show

153640	156040	And now let's introduce today's guest.
156040	159120	Bhaskar Sankara is president of the nation magazine,
159120	160880	the founding editor of Jacobin,
160880	163620	and the author of a book called The Socialist Manifesto,
163620	165240	the case for radical politics
165240	167440	and an era of extreme inequality.
167440	169280	Please welcome Bhaskar Sankara.
172040	174240	Bhaskar, thank you so much for being on the show.
174240	175160	Thanks for having me.
175160	176480	I feel like it's long overdue
176480	178800	because a lot of the issues that you write about
178800	180400	in your work and that you cover
180400	183000	are issues we've discussed on this show.
183000	186440	And you identify as a socialist and a leftist.
186440	188720	I think that it's a really interesting time
188720	191360	for those ideas in America because on the one hand,
191360	195600	you see them spreading or becoming more popular
195600	197920	in the public to some degree,
197920	202200	in the policy apparatus to some degree.
202200	204360	And yet the number of people,
204360	205560	I saw a Pew research study,
205600	208600	a number of people who have positive views
208600	210840	of socialism is going down and is much lower
210840	213400	than people have positive views of capitalism.
213400	216160	Take those broad surveys for what they are,
217000	220480	but it's sort of like, is this growing or is it not?
220480	223640	How do you feel about the overall prospects
223640	227200	for leftist politics and these policies
227200	228720	in America right now?
228720	229840	Well, I think 10 years ago,
229840	233000	you could say socialism in America as a current,
233000	234720	even as an opposition movement,
234720	236360	was basically dead.
236360	239280	And now you could say it's on life support.
239280	241360	It depends on your perspective.
241360	242880	I was like, oh, she's doing good.
242880	244400	She's only in a coma now.
244400	247080	So we'll see what happens in a couple of years.
247080	247920	Yeah.
247920	248760	Exactly.
248760	251000	So I think that for me, it feels fantastic.
251000	254840	I became a card-carrying member
254840	256560	of the Democratic Socialist of America.
256560	257640	Not actually card-carrying
257640	259320	because there were two dysfunctional
259320	261640	to actually get me a card at the time.
261680	265960	In April 2007, there was about 5,000 of us
265960	268760	and I was among the youngest members.
268760	271480	I joined right before my 18th birthday.
272480	276080	And today there's around 100,000 members of DSA,
276080	278520	the Democratic Socialist of America.
278520	281280	Jacobin, the Socialist magazine I founded,
281280	286120	has around 66,000 or so subscribers.
286120	290720	There is a base and obviously between having Bernie Sanders
290720	293440	as a self-identified Democratic Socialist,
293440	295960	politicians like Alexander Kasiroportez,
295960	299040	there is a small amount
299040	304040	of highly visible Democratic Socialists in public life.
304920	308360	And that's not something we had in the recent past
308360	312000	in the US and in that sense, it's doing great.
312000	314600	Now, is it ready to storm the barricades
314600	317040	and really change American society
317040	318520	in a fundamental way?
318520	321480	Maybe not, but for a opposition movement
321480	326280	that's just getting its legs, I'm not too disappointed.
326280	328080	Well, let's talk about Bernie Sanders
328080	332480	because when his first few campaigns,
333480	337000	they grew to such size, they ended up powering a movement.
337000	339080	The movement continued in many ways,
339080	343120	which resulted in the growth of the DSA.
343120	346120	But if you contrast that with Donald Trump's movement,
346120	348600	and I don't wanna create an equivalency there,
348600	350600	but there are some similarities,
352320	355640	his movement has taken over an entire party
355640	359520	and has the Democratic Socialist movement,
359520	361360	you can say, oh, there's a mayor over here,
361360	363040	there's some state legislatures over there,
363040	366560	you've got here in LA, we have, I believe,
366560	369080	three city council people out of 15
369080	372400	who are members or at least associated with the DSA.
372760	375880	Hey, yeah, those are successes for the movement,
376880	380600	but the MAGA movement has representatives,
380600	382440	senators, governors, et cetera,
382440	384800	and hey, they don't win every election yada yada,
384800	388320	but in terms of the way that it has been injected
388320	392040	into the mainstream of American politics
392040	397040	in this stunningly swift way is kind of in sharp contrast
397040	399800	to what happened to the Bernie Sanders movement
399800	400840	or the relative success.
400840	404120	So what do you credit that to,
404120	406240	or do you think that the comparison I'm drawing
406240	408640	is false entirely, which you may?
408640	410400	Well, I think that it's always easier
410400	415040	to organize big money and you get some organic backing
415040	419240	from ordinary people in the interests of capital.
419240	421880	So fundamentally, Donald Trump's appeal was,
421880	424760	I'm a businessman, I know what I have, make deals,
424760	426320	I'm gonna cut a better deal for you,
426320	429000	ordinary American, and also for American business
429000	430160	in the world.
430160	434200	And I think that's an easier appeal to make than,
434200	437280	my name is Bernie Sanders, I'm an outsider,
437280	439680	I wanna take on millionaires and billionaires,
439680	442760	can you loan me $27?
442760	446680	And I promise I'll spend your money well, fly economy,
446680	449840	and travel around the country, getting my message out.
449840	454480	And I think that the Sanders route was a lot tougher.
454480	457520	Trump was tapping into, I think,
457520	459880	a continuum of Republican politics.
459880	461240	We don't even think of it that way,
461240	465360	but the Tea Party to Trump, I think had common threads.
465360	467680	And the hysteria that Trump whipped up
467680	470200	around Obama's birth certificate was kind of part
470200	472680	of tapping into that old Tea Party base,
472680	474400	but radicalizing it.
474400	478280	Then he was able to, with his own gifts as an orator,
478280	479880	he might not appeal to everyone,
479880	483000	but he obviously is a skilled communicator
483000	486200	in a certain way, and an entertainer, you know?
486200	488200	I mean, the guy will riff for three hours
488200	490640	and get a stretch about everybody he hates,
490640	493120	and that's, you know, just as a stand-up comic,
493120	495680	like that's impressive, and the guy gets laughs, you know?
495680	499840	It is a feat of oration, what he does.
499840	503080	And he has a cadence, he has, just as a performer,
503080	506280	I think he has his skills, you know?
506280	508960	Bernie always seems like he's a bit tired and fed up,
508960	511760	which he is at this point, he has every right to be,
511760	515080	but Trump was able to combine his natural gifts,
515080	517240	the space that he had cultivated,
517240	520320	and radicalized a bit with the Obama birthday stuff,
520320	522320	with a lot of his own money,
522320	525960	and a very hollowed-out Republican party
525960	529320	that he just knew how to pick apart.
529320	531960	And by the time they realized that it was too late
531960	534920	to, they needed to stop him, it was too late,
534920	538360	whereas the DNC realized they had to stop Bernie,
538360	540560	but it wasn't too late, you know?
540560	542560	That Obama was able to make a few calls,
542560	545160	and Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris,
545160	547720	and others were able to, from their perspective,
547720	550720	did the smart thing, rally behind Joe Biden,
550720	552200	Joe Biden winning the election.
552200	556520	So on their own terms, they made a good decision,
556520	558760	but they were unable to stop Trump.
558760	563760	But I do think that maybe a stronger comparison
564800	567160	to Trump would be, and I say this to someone
567160	569520	who's generally a supporter of a lot of his policies,
569520	571320	would be someone like Amalon, Mexico,
571320	574720	who's been able to combine some of his oratory and charisma,
574720	577560	and somewhat strongman personality,
577560	581880	but combine it with a genuinely progressive agenda.
581880	583920	I think Bernie was always, in the United States,
583920	586160	doing something a little bit different
586160	588960	and a more difficult task, given our context.
588960	592360	Mm, and draw that comparison a little bit more
592360	596080	between Amalon who, in Mexico,
596080	597680	and what Bernie did that's more difficult.
597680	599240	Just pull that out some more.
599240	601480	Yeah, I think that, first of all,
601480	605200	Amal was someone who ran multiple times for president.
605200	607600	He arguably won in 2006.
607600	610040	He had the election, again, some people say,
610040	612000	stolen from him then, but either way,
612000	614200	he was a very well-known national figure.
615600	620280	He is someone who came from a lot of the historical networks
620280	622080	that they left, but he figured out
622080	625320	that he had to leave and abandon some of those networks
625320	627640	and ways of talking and try to articulate
627640	630120	a more populist framework
630120	633760	for explaining who he was to the Mexican people
633760	636920	and what his appeal was about.
636920	640280	It was not just the regular left-wing appeals
640280	643320	about redistribution and taking on the wealthy,
643320	647560	but he combined it with this idea of fighting corruption
647560	650360	and fighting to preserve the sanctity and purity
650360	652200	of Mexican republicanism
652200	655160	in a national, popular sense.
655160	657440	Bernie Sanders, in the same way,
657440	660800	came from the hard left, really, in the United States.
660800	664360	He was a member of the Young People's Socials League,
664360	666680	which just sounds incredibly anachronistic,
666680	668560	as if anyone, all the people I know
668560	671040	who are members of the Young People's Socials League
671040	673200	are, like, 85 years old.
673200	674600	Right, they're not young anymore.
676200	678560	At the reunions, they're all on walkers, yeah.
678560	682720	He joined in the left,
682720	684200	there was before the new left, really.
684200	685520	Like, he was interested in this
685520	687800	when he was at Brooklyn College
687800	689840	and later on at the University of Chicago.
689840	692480	So we're talking about pretty early on in the 1960s.
692480	693800	I actually know a guy,
694880	698880	I'm not sure if he wants me to cite him,
698880	701240	but he's like,
701240	703440	he loves to tell me stories about this period
703440	705920	because he was a leftist in the late 50s and the 60s.
705920	708920	And often, you can't really trust all of his stories
708920	710200	that he once told me.
710200	712200	So then I told the Black Panther Party,
713200	716080	your slogan shouldn't be free Huey Newton,
716080	717800	it should just be free Huey.
717800	718640	But...
722120	724400	So take this with a grain of salt,
724400	726000	but you can tell me,
726000	727480	he recruited Bernie Sanders
727480	730400	to not just the Young People's Socials League.
730400	732160	And that, I think, is the established fact
732160	734400	that he did that in the University of Chicago.
734400	737440	But he recruited him to the,
738440	743440	the Shackmanite kind of Trotsky-oriented fraction
744240	746920	of the Young People's Socials League
746920	749040	in the early 1960s.
749040	752000	So Bernie was very steeply entrenched in the left.
753040	755480	I mean, Bernie, I used to do a joke on stage
755480	757480	about how Bernie came to LA
757480	760240	when he was running the second time.
760240	762720	And he gave a speech about,
762720	764560	you should all be so proud,
764560	765600	you have the dodges,
765600	768400	because we were all so sad in Brooklyn
768400	770440	when the dodges moved to LA.
770440	771520	And I was like, wow,
771520	774480	that's the moment I realized he was too old to be president.
774480	777000	Like you can't go around telling people
777000	779480	that you remember when the Dodgers left Brooklyn.
779480	782800	Like that is the oldest school thing possible.
782800	786760	That's like history books have been written about this.
786760	791440	So he's steeped in that sort of like mid-century America
791440	793200	in this very specific way.
793200	795080	Yeah, and exactly, I think that was part of his strength
795160	798640	because he both left behind that existing laughter.
798640	801240	He moved to Vermont in a place that he could,
801240	805040	he could really find a way to influence politics
805040	806960	at a bigger, bigger scale.
806960	808960	But he kept a lot of its allegiance
808960	811280	to the old bread and butter,
811280	812880	simple way of talking about things.
812880	814840	And often when people say that,
814840	816320	that could be a euphemism for,
816320	818040	let's not talk about gay people.
818040	820760	Let's not talk about racial justice and so on.
820760	824280	But Bernie Sanders is a product of the new left.
824280	825880	He's a product of the civil rights movement.
825880	829120	He's someone who went to Vermont to try to farm,
829120	831760	which is kind of just a crazy thought in and of itself
831760	833160	that kind of back to the land movement.
833160	834880	You would think they would maybe pick somewhere
834880	838240	a little bit more fertile than in his book.
838240	840320	I always wondered how he got to Vermont from Brooklyn.
840320	843080	He literally, it was part of like the back to the land,
843080	844600	like let's start a little homestead
844600	846320	in New England hippie movement.
846320	848920	I'm not sure if he intended to like survive by farming,
848920	850520	but it was definitely let's get a cabin,
850520	852160	let's get a little land.
852160	853000	Wow.
853280	856200	The same book where he talks kind of about,
856200	858640	the New York trolley dodgers or whatever,
858640	861160	the Brooklyn trolley dodgers leave in town
861160	863840	and him getting upset.
863840	867640	He also talks about surviving that first winter,
867640	872640	which was one of the worst winters in modern history
873080	874480	in terms of temperature and whatnot
874480	878440	and not having proper heat and trying to find enough
878440	882160	to burn, to stay warm.
882920	886520	He obviously has a little bit of that hippie-gippy
886520	890360	left in him, but he had a very simple message
890360	892760	and he said the same thing in his first run
892760	895240	in the early 1970s for office,
895240	897480	all the way up to his 2016 run,
897480	900520	which was millionaires control too much
900520	902480	of this country's wealth.
902480	904880	He would give the same percentage,
904880	908600	X percentage of people control Y percentage of the wealth,
908600	910920	same framing, same syntax.
910920	915600	And in a way, I think the very old,
915600	919200	somewhat mid-century New York ethnic accent
919200	921360	combined with that straight talk,
921360	925240	I think it resonated deeply in a lot of people.
925240	930240	It made somewhat radical ideas seem accessible,
930360	931360	comprehensible.
931360	932840	Yeah, and I made him seem authentic.
932840	934120	This guy's been saying the same thing.
934120	936320	It made it clear that he was authentic, honestly.
936320	938920	That this guy has been saying these same things
938920	942520	for the last 50 years, he comes by it honestly
942520	945360	and we can take him at his word.
945360	946680	But to your point about,
946680	948120	and I don't wanna spend the entire time
948120	951000	relitigating the last couple of elections,
951000	953240	but you're correct that there was a concerted effort
953240	955000	by the Democratic Party to beat him
955000	956800	because Obama and that wing of the party
956800	958600	thought that Bernie couldn't win
958600	963600	and they teamed up to consolidate and beat him.
964320	965840	And I've heard that narrative before
965840	967560	talking to folks in the DSA,
967560	968720	folks who are big Bernie supporters,
968720	971040	ah, Bernie got screwed by the Democratic Party,
971040	973840	but there were also people trying to screw Trump,
973840	975480	maybe not as well.
975480	979200	And you do at some point have to win, right?
979200	981560	Like, Bernie's argument or the argument
981560	982720	of a lot of Bernie supporters were,
982720	984360	well, Bernie would have beaten Trump,
985200	988840	but okay, and would have beaten him the first time as well
988840	991000	in the Hillary Clinton election.
991000	992800	And okay, that's a hypothetical,
992800	994960	but a good piece of support for the hypothetical would be
994960	996080	if he had won the primary.
996080	998560	If you want to prove that your political movement
998560	1002520	has the goods, has the juice to sweep the entire country,
1002520	1004920	then it would be helpful to win the primary first.
1004920	1007160	And Bernie had a lot of support,
1007160	1010480	but it's like, hey, was it just that Obama screwed it?
1010480	1013320	Well, Obama might not have been able to do that
1013320	1016280	if he had had massively more support than he did
1016280	1021280	versus, whereas Trump, a thought that I have is,
1021480	1023080	you said Trump is running on the thing
1023080	1024520	of being a billionaire, et cetera,
1024520	1027760	or a very wealthy man who can make business deals,
1027760	1030360	he was also running on pure hate, right?
1030360	1033640	Just like powering of there are people out there
1033640	1034480	who are trying to screw you,
1034480	1035560	there's people coming over the border,
1035560	1038200	there's people you hate, I'm gonna take vengeance on them.
1038200	1040920	And so part of what I wondered is like,
1040920	1044800	is that not currently in where we are in American politics,
1044800	1046040	maybe just more powerful?
1046040	1049560	Is there more support for that than for socialism
1049560	1054440	and what Bernie and folks like you are asking folks to support?
1054440	1056600	So I think it's worth keeping in mind,
1056600	1058880	well, first of all, let's concede.
1058880	1061000	My view is that Bernie lost the election
1061000	1064720	and he lost because in 2016, he wasn't recognizable,
1064720	1066040	he wasn't considered credible
1066040	1068720	until all of a sudden his message resonated
1068720	1070420	by then it was almost too late.
1070420	1073720	So I think if he had started with his momentum
1073720	1075480	against Clinton earlier,
1075480	1077560	I think he would have credibly won.
1077560	1081140	There was nothing the DNC could have done to stop him.
1082040	1084160	He just got out of the gate a little bit slow
1084160	1087960	in part because this was always meant
1087960	1089840	to be something of a protest candidacy.
1089840	1092920	And I think he was surprised by how seriously he took you.
1092920	1094240	So he went.
1094240	1097280	If his 2016 campaign had been his second campaign,
1097280	1099560	not his first, things might have been different.
1099560	1101640	Yeah, and I think in his second campaign,
1101640	1104880	I think by then the democratic field was just broken up
1104880	1106680	into so many different camps.
1106680	1109120	And it just happened to be that the Bernie camp
1109120	1112920	was the largest of these many polarized camps.
1112920	1116320	But the Democrats had something that Obama,
1116320	1118400	that the Republicans didn't have,
1118400	1120680	which is a big unifying figure
1120680	1122900	that could unite the other camps.
1122900	1124880	And ultimately it wasn't just a backdoor deal
1124880	1127200	that Obama cut, it was a deal connected
1127200	1129200	to various constituencies.
1129200	1132320	And I think for a lot of let's say black voters,
1132320	1135040	particularly older black voters in the South
1135040	1138200	and South Carolina, they voted for Biden
1138200	1142440	because their primary goal was to find someone
1142480	1144560	who they thought was electable
1144560	1147040	and find someone who they thought could be Trump.
1147040	1149920	And I think the rational kernel of it is
1149920	1152600	not that Biden's policies would have been better
1152600	1154800	in a vacuum from Bernie's policies,
1154800	1158000	but that Biden was electable
1158000	1161360	and they would bear the brunt of another Trump presidency.
1161360	1164680	So in that case, it's a bunch of different actors
1164680	1166480	acting pretty rationally.
1166480	1171480	And I was a Bernie national surrogate in 2020.
1171560	1176560	I chalk it up as just losing, losing the game of politics.
1177800	1181480	And if it was a backroom way for the burning crats to win,
1181480	1184960	I would have loved to pursue that backroom way.
1184960	1188120	Yeah, that's politics is making the phone calls,
1188120	1190840	knowing the people, knowing, hey, this person,
1190840	1192280	we have to gotta get this person
1192280	1193720	and their constituency on our side.
1193720	1196080	Like you can't wish that away.
1196080	1200080	You have to sort of win that process to some degree.
1200960	1203640	So I mean, do you think that, sorry, please go on.
1203640	1206000	No, but as far as your question on,
1207040	1210400	is there a stronger constituency for hate in the US
1210400	1212640	or for Trump's sort of vitriolic appeals
1212640	1215360	and for the Bernie appeals?
1215360	1218000	I would say that when it comes to redistribution,
1218000	1219520	yeah, it might be a watch.
1219520	1222320	There might be a lot of half the country hoping
1222320	1225120	for more redistribution in the abstract,
1225120	1229600	half the country still bed into they're gonna strike it rich.
1229600	1232320	So maybe let's hold off this redistribution stuff.
1232320	1235800	I know I'm way behind on my mortgage and I'm in medical bed,
1235800	1240120	but I'm one good move away from being wealthy.
1240120	1242880	Of course, there's some aspect of that.
1242880	1245640	When you compare America to, let's say Western Europe,
1245640	1247560	I think you would find that Americans are,
1247560	1249600	one, more welcoming of immigrants
1249600	1251280	in a lot of countries in Western Europe.
1251280	1252680	So Americans, for example,
1252680	1255040	even a lot of people who vote for Trump,
1255040	1258120	one, they vastly overestimate the amount of
1259120	1261840	undocumented immigration the United States has,
1261840	1263000	but more generally,
1263000	1267600	therefore higher amounts of legal immigration
1267600	1271280	and therefore tightening the border at the same time.
1271280	1273040	So which is very different than some
1273040	1275720	of these xenophobic appeals in Europe.
1276560	1278360	A vast majority of Americans are for things
1278360	1279680	like birthright citizenship.
1279680	1282160	My parents came to the US in 1988.
1282160	1284080	I was born in 1989.
1284200	1288160	I would imagine that maybe not as commanding
1288160	1290560	of a majority as it was in the past,
1290560	1293680	but probably a majority of Republicans
1293680	1296880	would agree that I have a right to be a US citizen.
1296880	1300520	That's not the case in a lot of European countries.
1301560	1305240	Most of those countries don't have birthright citizenship
1305240	1308680	like we have throughout most of the Western hemisphere.
1308680	1309880	On a host of other issues,
1309880	1313400	I think you'll find that Americans as a whole,
1313400	1317080	especially young people, hold more progressive views
1317080	1320920	than their peers in the advanced capitalist world
1320920	1324520	in Europe and even Japan, South Korea.
1325800	1330120	This is a good starting point for us
1330120	1331840	from progressive politics.
1331840	1334320	And I think that we shouldn't let Trump's appeal
1334320	1337760	maybe make us too pessimistic
1337760	1341920	about where most Americans are on these issues.
1341920	1344840	Yeah, I agree because and I think
1344840	1347840	that is what makes this contrast so interesting to me
1347840	1351600	is that you feel the groundswell of support for these issues.
1351600	1356160	I mean, it's literally just here on YouTube
1356160	1358840	when I put in the title of something,
1358840	1360760	Billionaires Capitalism, right?
1360760	1362880	I get more views when I do that, right?
1362880	1365040	Because the audience is like, oh my God,
1365040	1367040	yes, someone is saying the thing that I wanna hear, right?
1367040	1369880	Like I can tell that there's an undercurrent.
1369880	1372040	I guess my job sort of as a comedian and broadcaster
1372040	1373200	to know how people are feeling
1373200	1374920	and to make things that speak to that
1374920	1377800	that also line up with what I personally believe,
1377800	1380880	I can sense that undercurrent as can so many other people
1380880	1383040	and the contrast between it
1383040	1386640	and the electoral success is like somewhat fascinating.
1386640	1388240	You see all these positive signs,
1388240	1390440	but you also see, well, hold on a second,
1390440	1393040	why aren't politicians who espouse
1393040	1394840	some of these policies doing better?
1394840	1397480	But before we get deeper into that, I'd love actually,
1397480	1398760	I think we waited a little too long
1398760	1400640	in the podcast to do this.
1400640	1403480	When you talk about socialism and democratic socialism,
1403480	1405640	do you have a capsule summary of what you mean by that?
1405640	1407680	Because I don't want to, you know,
1407680	1408880	people are maybe feeling in the blank
1408880	1413040	of what they believe that your political beliefs
1413040	1414800	or project is.
1414800	1417200	Well, fundamentally to me, socialism is about
1417200	1420120	at a minimum securing people's social
1420120	1424280	and economic necessities and saying that people
1424280	1427040	are entitled to certain things just by virtue of being born.
1427040	1430600	So at the very least, that means the state
1430600	1435600	as a provider of last resort for things like healthcare,
1436480	1439480	childcare, housing, you know, nutrition.
1439480	1441880	So they're making sure we have that baseline
1441880	1444120	of a welfare state.
1445040	1448000	Secondly, to me, it's about extended democracy
1448000	1451160	from purely the formal political realm
1451160	1453920	into the economic realm as well.
1453920	1458280	So if we were to agree that democracy is a good thing
1458280	1461640	at the ballot box, why shouldn't we have greater degrees
1461640	1463600	of democracy at our workplace?
1463600	1467800	And within those two broad sets of principles,
1467800	1470040	I think you could have a lot of different forms.
1470040	1475040	So I don't suppose that a centrally planned economy
1475040	1477720	would be a great system to live under.
1477720	1480080	You know, I think there's certain both incentive
1480080	1485080	and informational problems that arise in those systems.
1485680	1486760	Yeah.
1486760	1489080	But you could still have markets
1489080	1492160	where you have an employee owned
1492160	1495360	or worker owners controlling their workplaces
1495360	1498240	and competing with each other to produce goods and services
1498240	1502960	and a private sector for consumer goods and services
1502960	1505680	while also having a larger state sector
1505680	1508320	that secures things like healthcare
1508320	1512040	or some of the big, what economists would call
1512040	1515440	natural monopolies like our, you know,
1515440	1517200	railroad network or things like that
1517200	1520280	where we feel like maybe it would be fine for there
1520280	1523720	to just be one actor in the sphere.
1523720	1527920	And we'd rather not be a giant corporate actor.
1527920	1530720	We'd rather have the state where in theory
1530720	1534040	we have greater scope to control the realm of state action.
1534040	1536800	So as a democratic socialist, part of what I believe in
1536800	1541800	is in a sense a reconciliation of liberalism and socialism.
1543440	1546640	So for example, I think rights are great.
1546640	1550360	And it's great to have this idea that yes, democracy
1550360	1552520	is excellent in most spheres of life,
1552520	1554960	but there are certain things where I don't want my neighbor
1554960	1557840	intruding on my personal consumption choice.
1557840	1561680	I don't want my neighbor or the majority restricting
1561680	1566160	on my ability to speak freely or to do my own thing.
1566160	1569120	And I think those are great aspects of liberalism.
1569120	1572320	And I think they're perfectly reconcilable
1572320	1576440	with a socialism that tries to secure people's rights
1576440	1581440	to develop into individuals that can truly,
1582560	1583920	you know, reach their potentials
1583920	1588920	and can participate in this, in our society.
1589360	1592440	Because, you know, right now I think we take for granted
1592440	1595360	as Americans that a kid born in, you know,
1595360	1599640	Fairfield, Connecticut is going to have a radically different
1601120	1604800	life and life outcomes and opportunities as a kid born,
1604800	1608920	you know, 20, 30 miles away and in Hartford or Waterbury.
1608920	1611120	And I'm doing very Connecticut example.
1611120	1616600	Oh, everybody is aware of the socioeconomic strata
1616600	1618920	of different Connecticut cities and towns.
1618920	1620440	I think we all know this.
1620440	1621280	No, I know what you're talking about.
1621280	1623080	You're talking about like where I grew up on Long Island
1623080	1624400	versus Brownsville, Brooklyn, right?
1624400	1627280	Or pick your neighborhood where you're like,
1627280	1628840	oh, yeah, that's the bad part of town.
1628840	1630440	And this is the good part of town, right?
1630440	1633080	We just take for granted that, you know,
1633080	1636520	some kids going to public schools in some neighborhoods,
1636520	1638880	we're not even like Britain where, yeah, of course,
1638880	1641280	we ship people out to fancy boarding schools
1641280	1642400	are going to have different outcomes.
1642400	1644680	But public schools, we take for granted
1644680	1646640	that some of them are going to produce doctors
1646640	1649680	and lawyers and engineers and other schools
1649680	1651640	are going to produce dropouts.
1651640	1655000	And that's not normal for a rich country
1655000	1657200	where we could easily solve that problem, not even
1657200	1661480	through socialist revolution, but through tax and transfers
1661480	1663640	and investments and jobs programs
1663640	1665200	and a host of other things.
1665200	1667160	Yeah, I thought your answer was interesting there
1667160	1671440	because you sort of gave us the entire scope all the way
1671440	1673600	from the minimal to the maximal version of socialism.
1673600	1678080	You ended by talking about a substantially different economic
1678080	1681040	system that has a lot more state action,
1681040	1683680	worker cooperatives that are competing with each other.
1683680	1685520	We could dive into that.
1685520	1688320	But you also had, on the other hand,
1688320	1693320	talking about simply expanded social welfare programs
1693320	1694960	of the kind that we're already used to.
1694960	1697560	Like we already provide in America
1697560	1700400	many of the types of programs that you're talking about.
1700400	1704720	We have a somewhat socialized version of education.
1704720	1707320	We have public school K through 12.
1707320	1710280	We do not have that for higher education.
1710280	1712440	And we could talk about ways that we
1712440	1715960	could expand that for public education
1715960	1719000	so that your zip code does not determine how much,
1719000	1721920	that we don't fund public schools via property taxes,
1721920	1725480	meaning wealthier areas have better schools.
1725480	1728200	And what I find really interesting
1728200	1730480	is that in the last couple of years,
1730480	1735520	we have tested a lot of the most immediate socialist ideas
1735520	1736800	if we want to label them that way.
1736800	1742640	During the pandemic, there was massively increased welfare
1742640	1745480	payment or welfare payments of general kinds
1745480	1747200	to folks during the pandemic.
1747200	1753480	We had expanded tax credits, child welfare, et cetera,
1753480	1755520	unemployment benefits.
1755520	1759960	And those had huge beneficial impacts on people's lives
1759960	1762200	that then a couple of years later were removed.
1762200	1764560	Also, going back to the 2020 election,
1764600	1766720	when Joe Biden came into office,
1766720	1773040	he at least acted as though he was going to be much more of a,
1773040	1774240	I don't want to say a socialist,
1774240	1777360	but he was proclaiming himself sort
1777360	1779080	of the next coming of FDR, right?
1779080	1780920	He was going to do New Deal-style stuff.
1780920	1783560	And he did some of it, giant infrastructure spending,
1783560	1785600	et cetera, antitrust enforcement.
1785600	1788080	Those were all things that I expected an Elizabeth Warren
1788080	1791880	or a Bernie Sanders president to do, not a Joe Biden.
1791880	1797000	And so it feels on the policy level, holy shit,
1797000	1800320	some of these things have become not impossible in America,
1800320	1802560	even if we're not sure if they're going to stick around.
1802560	1803720	Do you have any view on that?
1803720	1806400	Yeah, I think that one interesting, first of all,
1806400	1808840	I think that the infrastructure bill
1808840	1811800	was a positive development.
1811800	1813640	It was over a trillion dollars of funding
1813640	1816920	for Roadsbridge's mass transit rail service.
1816920	1818320	Obviously, that's better than what
1818320	1820520	we would have gotten from a Trump administration.
1820520	1826320	Obviously, it's a policy success.
1826320	1831640	But I guess that sometimes the United States,
1831640	1835720	the reason why a lot of Americans feel like, oh, well,
1835720	1839320	we're already trying massive socialist-style spending
1839320	1842800	in the US, and we already have this massive welfare state,
1842800	1846760	but it just doesn't work, is because we tend
1846760	1849680	to have quite inefficiently designed programs.
1850680	1853040	When we do spend money on welfare,
1853040	1857160	we needlessly mean-tested, and we waste time and resources,
1857160	1859320	and we weaken these programs by saying,
1859320	1863040	you have to be this poor to use it.
1863040	1865720	Not only that, it does create real incentives
1865720	1868960	and disincentives, and it creates resentment towards,
1868960	1870640	let's say if you want to use this category,
1870640	1873120	it's kind of a made-up category, but the lower middle class
1873120	1875720	feels like, oh, well, I'm struggling,
1875720	1877680	or the working poor feels like I'm struggling,
1877680	1880200	but I don't qualify for something that I qualify for
1880200	1882880	if I just worked a little bit less,
1882880	1887680	and you end up dividing up working-class people
1887680	1890040	that have invested interest in protecting
1890040	1893240	a lot of the same programs, and those people who
1893240	1897120	might be working and might not qualify, for example,
1897120	1902080	for Medicaid would benefit from living in a community,
1902080	1904080	because they already live in these areas,
1904080	1907280	with their neighbors who are able to access
1907280	1909360	good health care and things like that.
1909360	1912360	So it's both the design of the programs isn't great,
1912360	1915240	and often we tend to create programs
1915240	1920520	where we allow corporations to push prices sky-high
1920520	1922240	for certain things like health care,
1922240	1925800	and our solution to the problem is by subsidizing the poorest
1925800	1927360	so they're able to access this market,
1927360	1929600	but we're doing nothing to address the cost of things.
1929600	1933160	So with education, we're doing this, higher education,
1933160	1935800	and with health care, whereas in other more
1935800	1940040	state-ified systems, you're able to find ways
1940040	1943840	to more radically reduce cost, and that's
1943840	1947960	a reason why we spend a larger percentage of our GDP
1947960	1951520	on health care than other countries like even the UK,
1951520	1953720	which has a system more expensive than Medicare
1953720	1956840	for all our main demand of the United States,
1956840	1961080	but an entire national health service.
1961080	1965160	So I often think that even things that the bill back better
1965160	1967920	kind of would emerge out of it, and would actually
1967920	1970160	get passed the infrastructure bill,
1970160	1973120	I question the design of some of those things.
1973120	1980000	Are we just subsidizing willy-nilly a lot of green companies?
1980000	1980560	Sure.
1980560	1983320	I'd rather subsidize them than other forms of capital,
1983320	1986360	but are we actually controlling the outcomes of these subsidies
1986360	1988160	or are we just throwing money at things?
1988160	1988880	Right.
1988920	1991440	Are we just giving money to more corporations
1991440	1995040	that we like maybe a little bit better,
1995040	1998360	but we're not getting at the root of the problem?
1998360	1999160	Hey, everybody.
1999160	2000920	I know we're in the ad break, but we're doing something
2000920	2002000	a little bit different today.
2002000	2004600	Today, I'm going to tell you about an amazing group of people
2004600	2006920	who did not pay us anything to be a part of the show.
2006920	2008640	We just think they do amazing work,
2008640	2010720	and we wanted you to know about them.
2010720	2013600	You might remember back in 2018, those heart-wrenching stories
2013600	2016720	of families torn apart by border patrol, refugee children
2016720	2018200	being pulled away from their parents
2018200	2020880	who were in turn deported to their home countries.
2020880	2023680	It was devastating then, and it's just as devastating now,
2023680	2026160	with hundreds of families still not reunited
2026160	2027680	after all these years.
2027680	2030360	You know, we discuss so many problems on factually,
2030360	2032920	but I firmly believe that there is always something
2032920	2034720	that can be done about those problems.
2034720	2037120	And recently, I came across an organization
2037120	2040800	called All Otrolado, which works to reunify families.
2040800	2043400	They provide holistic legal and humanitarian support
2043400	2045600	to refugees, deportees, and other migrants
2045600	2048200	in the US and Tijuana through a multidisciplinary,
2048200	2051200	client-centered, harm reduction-based practice.
2051200	2053480	Since 2018, they have successfully brought together
2053480	2056000	over 100 families torn apart by Trump's
2056000	2057720	zero-tolerance policy.
2057720	2060360	But reuniting those families is just the beginning.
2060360	2062640	All Otrolado continues to support each family
2062640	2064800	with legal aid, housing, and counseling
2064800	2066840	to help heal and get back on their feet.
2066840	2068760	I mean, can you imagine the agony
2068760	2070480	of having your child ripped from your arms,
2070480	2072760	unsure of when you'll see them again?
2072760	2075280	We cannot allow such family separations to continue,
2075280	2077000	so if you're like me and believe
2077000	2078640	that all families belong together,
2078640	2082200	then join me in supporting All Otrolado and Donate Today.
2082200	2084160	You can find the link to Donate to All Otrolado

2115120	2117400	they even started advertising on this show.
2117400	2119520	This day and age, it is shockingly simple
2119520	2121720	for data brokers to peddle your personal information
2121720	2122840	without your consent.
2122840	2124520	These data brokers may be selling your name,
2124520	2125720	phone number, and home address,
2125720	2128160	and you might never even know it's happening.
2128160	2130720	Trying to locate and remove all this data yourself

2148160	2151040	from doxing to scams and even identity theft.
2151040	2153120	In some cases, having your info online
2153120	2154400	can turn cyber stalking
2154400	2157080	into good old fashioned in-person stalking.

2181560	2182400	Folks, you know,
2182400	2184360	I am all about those little pick-me-ups throughout the day.
2184360	2185800	Whether it's tackling work tasks
2185800	2187360	or conquering chores around the house,
2187360	2189120	treating myself is a must.
2189120	2191120	And you know what gets me smiling every time?
2191120	2192240	Japanese snacks.
2192240	2193960	Not only are they bursting with flavor,
2193960	2195800	but their cute packaging and quirky vibes
2195800	2197560	add an extra layer of fun.
2197560	2199280	That is why teaming up with Bokksu,
2199280	2201000	a Japanese snack subscription box
2201000	2202680	has been such an absolute delight
2202680	2203800	because these are not just
2203800	2205600	your run-of-the-mill grocery store snacks.
2205600	2208760	Each month, Bokksu brings you over 20 unique treats
2208760	2211200	that you can normally find only in Japan.
2211200	2213720	Plus, they throw in a nifty guide packed with info
2213720	2216080	about each snack and Japanese culture.
2216080	2217400	Snacking while learning?
2217400	2218240	Are you kidding?
2218240	2220320	It's like this was literally made for me.
2220320	2223920	Oh, and each box ships free from Japan straight to your door.
2223920	2225400	I happen to have a box right here
2225400	2226320	and let me tell you something.
2226320	2228720	I loved the first box they sent so much.
2228720	2229640	I told our ad people,
2229640	2231720	please make sure that Bokksu re-ups
2231720	2234280	because I gotta get another box of these snacks.
2234280	2237600	First of all, check out this incredible guide here
2237600	2239280	full of beautiful photos.
2239280	2240880	It tells you about all the different snacks.
2240880	2242280	You know, my girlfriend's gluten-free
2242280	2243480	so we can find one in here
2243480	2246920	that makes sure it works for her dietary restrictions.
2246920	2248040	So, but she's not here right now.
2248040	2250200	So I'm gonna make sure I eat one of the gluten-y ones.
2250200	2252040	Ooh, 20th century pear biscuit.
2252040	2254200	This delicate biscuit is a luxurious blend
2254200	2256760	of 20th century Asian pear rich cheese
2256760	2258600	and decadent white chocolate.
2258600	2260720	Oh, it contains wheat so that means I should eat it.
2260720	2261720	All right, let me find it here.
2261720	2263680	20th century pear biscuit.
2263680	2265000	Okay, here we go, found it.
2265000	2266720	20th century pear biscuit.
2266720	2268840	Cute little packaging, let me give it a try.
2269920	2270760	Oh my gosh.
2272440	2273600	That is so good.
2273600	2276120	Oh, the pear flavor is really strong.
2276120	2278960	Mm, it's like a strong aroma.
2279160	2280240	Next to this crunchy biscuit,
2280240	2282320	the textural contrast is really wonderful.
2282320	2284240	I mean, that is so good.
2284240	2285080	And guess what?
2285080	2288400	There are 19 other different snacks in here for me to try.
2289400	2290760	I love this service so much.
2290760	2291640	And you know why?
2291640	2293720	My favorite thing about it is that they support
2293720	2296000	small family-run businesses in Japan.
2296000	2297640	Bokksu has sourced these treats
2297640	2300800	by working with over 245 small makers in Japan,
2300800	2302160	helping out their businesses
2302160	2303920	and helping to preserve their traditions.
2303920	2305960	So if you love Japanese snacks as much as I do
2305960	2307000	and if you wanna try snacks
2307000	2309000	that you literally cannot get anywhere else
2309000	2310840	outside of going to Japan yourself,
2310840	2312600	you have gotta try out Bokksu.
2312600	2314600	Right now, you can use the code FACTUALLY
2314600	2317920	for $15 off your first order on bokksu.com.
2317920	2320480	That's code FACTUALLY for $15 off your first order
2320480	2321560	on bokksu.com.
2321560	2322400	Tell them Adam sent you
2322400	2324160	and now I gotta finish these snacks.
2325560	2327000	Oh man, that's really good.
2327000	2329120	I'm glad she's gluten-free, so I could eat this one.
2330560	2332760	Staying on healthcare for a second,
2332760	2335720	so much, so many times when we describe,
2335720	2338400	hey, here's what they do in Europe.
2338400	2339840	Here's how they organize a system
2339840	2342440	or here's how we could tweak our current subsidies
2342440	2344720	to make them better, et cetera.
2344720	2346680	We're talking about improvements
2346680	2349600	that just in literal fact would be better, right?
2349600	2352240	Like when we talk about the American healthcare system,
2352240	2356080	we can go down this list of it's so expensive,
2356080	2358120	it's expensive because of multiple insurance companies
2358120	2359520	and because of the capitalist incentive.
2359520	2361360	If we had a single-payer system,
2361360	2362680	we would have better health outcomes,
2362680	2363800	everything would be cheaper
2363800	2365520	and this is being done around the globe.
2365520	2369640	It's sort of like incontrovertibly better in every way
2369640	2371920	and yet in the United States,
2371920	2374160	what is, you know, should almost be,
2374160	2375760	hey, there's an asteroid headed towards Earth,
2375760	2376960	let's look at it, it's up there,
2376960	2380240	this is real, you know, we know this for a fact,
2380240	2383360	becomes a political position that, you know,
2383360	2385080	rises and falls in popularity
2385080	2387760	and you know, I'll say right now, Medicare for All,
2387760	2391560	that is the socialist and the sort of birdie movement ask.
2391560	2395000	It's also sort of faded in popularity again in our politics.
2395000	2398200	It is less a part of our politics than it was five years ago.
2398200	2401920	And so it's such a strange state of affairs
2401920	2404560	that again, you know, a single-payer system,
2404560	2407000	better in every way, anyone who dives into the data,
2407000	2409560	it's very hard to argue that it wouldn't be.
2409560	2411000	It's very hard to defend the current system
2411000	2414760	and yet it seems so far from us being able to implement
2414760	2416840	what's like truly a common sense reform.
2417840	2419160	Why do you think that is
2419160	2420160	and what do you think the prospects are
2420160	2422000	in the future for that kind of program?
2422000	2423880	Well, I think in this case, what's interesting is
2423880	2425880	you have a chunk of the American public
2425880	2429920	that is already covered under a single-payer system,
2429920	2433640	be it retirees and also the poor,
2433640	2437400	and veterans as well who are covered through the VA
2437400	2439080	in an underfunded system,
2439080	2441720	but a system that's closer to the British NHS
2441720	2443400	than anything else.
2443400	2445000	So that chunk of Americans
2445000	2447480	are already covered by socialized medicine.
2447480	2449040	Then you have a chunk of Americans
2449040	2451360	who have stable jobs,
2451360	2455120	either they're lucky enough to have the old union jobs
2455120	2458040	and be a part of that 10% of the economy
2458040	2460520	that's covered under union contracts
2460520	2463440	or their manager or professionals
2463440	2467440	or others who have stable healthcare.
2467440	2470600	So then you have to kind of go down the list
2470600	2473560	until you find people who are getting really squeezed
2473560	2474760	by the current system.
2474760	2478920	Now, the new system would be better for a lot of people.
2479920	2484920	If we retain current spending for Medicaid and Medicare,
2487200	2491440	then in a system where we're better able to control costs,
2491440	2494200	we could actually provide more services
2494200	2497360	under Medicare, Medicaid.
2497360	2502360	If we had employers no longer responsible for healthcare,
2503840	2505360	then workers in America would be able
2505360	2508120	to use that extra bargaining power to demand
2508120	2511240	not just the platinum healthcare benefits
2511240	2515840	or their employers to pay for their HRAs
2515840	2518000	or these other tax-affirmed programs
2518000	2520920	like FSAs and HSAs.
2520920	2523040	If anyone's listened to this from the UK,
2523040	2526800	they probably just think we're insane with these acronyms,
2526800	2528880	but this is how complicated our system is,
2528880	2530680	but they'd be able to use that bargaining power
2530680	2533000	that's often spent by unions
2533000	2537160	talking about these private market benefit schemes
2537160	2540360	and actually use it towards wages or hours worked
2540360	2544360	or conditions or something more bread and butter.
2544360	2548600	So a lot of people would benefit from the new system,
2548600	2550600	but if they feel like they're getting enough
2550600	2552520	from the current system,
2552520	2555240	and if they're also in a perverse way,
2555240	2556840	maybe benefiting from the fact
2556840	2559360	that there's 20, 25 million people
2559360	2561960	who are essentially either not insured
2561960	2564680	or who are unable to access their benefits
2564680	2567000	because of how high the deductibles are,
2567000	2569920	they have the advantage of having,
2569920	2574920	let's say shorter wait times than in other systems.
2575120	2577560	It doesn't really equal that
2577560	2579400	because in practice,
2581280	2584400	you'd always encourage more doctors to join
2584400	2585560	and if people are worried about,
2585560	2586960	oh, in single payer systems,
2586960	2589800	you could see your primary care position right away,
2589800	2593080	but if you want to see a specialist that's sometimes longer
2593080	2596280	or sometimes the state kind of does its own triage
2597040	2598520	if you really need to see a specialist,
2598520	2599680	you'll see one tomorrow,
2599680	2603040	but if you need to see a dermatologist
2603040	2605560	for a cosmetic skin condition,
2605560	2609360	then you might have to wait three, four weeks.
2609360	2610240	That sort of thing.
2610240	2612320	You could just pay specialists more in the system.
2612320	2616800	You could find ways to fix this,
2616800	2619040	but I think that the constituency
2619040	2623360	that really is materially motivated to go out there
2623360	2628360	and to change US healthcare is actually not that massive
2628680	2631120	unless we have a politician,
2631120	2634160	a movement articulating the benefits
2634160	2636920	in a clear and concise way like Bernie did.
2636920	2638520	The entire Bernie campaign,
2638520	2642360	many of the people I know doing work around Medicare for all
2642360	2647360	were already insured by good employer-sponsored plans.
2648800	2650960	So it wasn't just self-interest.
2651080	2654520	I think it was about tying it to a broader vision of change
2654520	2658440	and taking on a really powerful forces,
2658440	2660360	that the medical industry.
2660360	2664400	Well, it's not just the medical industry though,
2664400	2667440	it's also like a lot of the public
2667440	2669520	has a vested interest in the current system.
2669520	2673120	You mentioned unions which would not have,
2673120	2677600	unions in the United States generally bargain for healthcare
2677600	2680920	and they have to spend maybe one out of every three
2680920	2681760	cycles.
2681760	2683280	We got to make sure we shore up our health insurance plan.
2683280	2685160	We got to make sure the plan is really good.
2685160	2687960	And hey, if there was a state-sponsored health insurance,
2687960	2689400	they wouldn't have to do so, right?
2689400	2691080	They could just focus on wages instead.
2691080	2694680	That argument's true and yet many unions
2694680	2696240	have not supported Medicare for all
2696240	2698880	because the members think,
2698880	2701160	well, hold on a second, I have great healthcare now,
2701160	2702720	I don't know what this plan would be like,
2702720	2703680	maybe it would be worse.
2703680	2706440	A, there's a huge education hurdle,
2706440	2708520	but then also sometimes the leadership of the unions
2708560	2711160	is like, well, healthcare is what we provide.
2711160	2714080	Like that is why people are excited to be a member
2714080	2716920	of the union is because they get the healthcare.
2716920	2718760	So if we don't give healthcare,
2718760	2721480	how do we know that we can get our members to show up
2721480	2722720	if we need to go on strike, et cetera?
2722720	2724560	Maybe they won't need us as much anymore.
2724560	2726360	And so those are, and by the way,
2726360	2730440	those are ways that good people in good faith
2730440	2732000	in the movement can end up,
2732000	2734680	the incentives push them in that direction.
2734680	2738480	And so it seems like there's still,
2738480	2741440	even though it all pencils outright,
2741440	2744200	there are sort of institutional barriers,
2744200	2747720	even in folks who, you would think that as a socialist,
2747720	2750920	you would be in the movement with,
2750920	2752520	with folks in the labor movement.
2752520	2755320	It's like an internal tension there.
2755320	2756680	Yeah, definitely, definitely.
2756680	2759400	I think that there's a lot of unions
2759400	2762880	who basically don't trust the government
2762920	2765880	to create a plan as good as what their members enjoy now,
2765880	2768240	or at least they feel like the union members
2768240	2769960	feel that way in the private sector.
2769960	2772160	And there's also some other unions that are afraid
2772160	2775440	that if there's a continued push
2775440	2778880	to make union membership volunteer,
2778880	2781400	so kind of open shops instead of closed shops,
2781400	2786240	that having kind of access to health insurance
2786240	2789040	and people get accessing those plans
2789040	2790720	through their union membership
2790720	2793160	is a potentially really important part
2793160	2795000	of keeping people in unions.
2795000	2797840	But I think these are ultimately pretty short-sighted.
2797840	2800680	I also think it's short-sighted for US industry
2800680	2804640	as a whole, particularly, let's say the US auto industry
2804640	2809320	that's competing with, historically competing with
2809320	2813280	labor in Japan and in Germany,
2813280	2816320	places that the state plays a much bigger role
2816320	2820560	in health provision, but are, you know,
2820560	2823000	kind of at a competitive disadvantage.
2823000	2826000	I think the counter is that employers
2827040	2830320	like having this major benefit
2830320	2832920	that everybody needs tied to employment
2832920	2835440	because it keeps people at their firms.
2835440	2838280	And again, they make the calculation
2838280	2843280	that it may be the control that they get over workers
2843320	2847320	and this leverage is more important than the savings.
2847320	2849800	But I think there's a host of small businesses
2849800	2854800	and others that would benefit from not having this burden.
2856960	2859280	Yeah, I mean, I think you're right that it's short-sighted.
2859280	2862280	It's a sort of short-term or current benefit
2862280	2864520	that some of these actors currently enjoy,
2864520	2868520	but that is preventing them from a greater long-term benefit.
2868520	2870360	And yeah, I'm just curious from your view,
2870360	2871960	how do we make progress on it?
2872000	2875320	You said, you know, it sort of needs a leader
2875320	2877960	like Bernie spreading the message,
2877960	2879600	but Bernie did the best job of it,
2879600	2881200	anyone's done in 30 years.
2881200	2884160	And, you know, again, you know, the wave rolled in,
2884160	2886840	but then went back.
2886840	2890520	And so are there, you know, in terms of this,
2890520	2892280	just looking at socialized medicine,
2892280	2895520	how does one build progress towards that
2895520	2896760	over the next few decades?
2896760	2898520	So the reason why I keep mentioning Bernie
2898520	2900560	as someone who's obviously my politics
2900680	2904840	are probably a step or two to Bernie's left in certain ways.
2904840	2907680	And I was a member of Socialist Movement
2907680	2912000	way before the first Bernie campaign in 2015, 2016.
2913000	2915480	But I keep mentioning him because I think
2915480	2918080	that we're in such a hollowed-out political environment
2919560	2923720	that we actually need big national politics
2923720	2925760	and politics at the level of communications
2925760	2927400	and politics at the level of almost like
2927400	2930120	a national kind of populist articulation,
2930120	2932120	the way that Trump provides it on the right.
2932120	2935120	And I think Bernie for a time was providing on the left
2935120	2939080	to break through this hollowed-out environment,
2939080	2942440	to break through and to re-engage people with politics.
2942440	2944920	So in the 2016 campaign,
2944920	2949000	you saw for the first time Trump and Bernie both
2949000	2951480	rallying people by the tens of thousands.
2951480	2953600	Yeah, it was displays that,
2953600	2957080	obviously there was a little bit of this in Obama's 2008 run,
2957120	2959960	but it's something that reminds you of politics
2959960	2962000	in another country, not politics,
2962000	2966240	as we've known it growing up in the United States.
2966240	2970840	Yeah, arena rallies for political candidates.
2970840	2973640	That's not something that people were doing for Al Gore.
2973640	2976560	Definitely, it would be like a once a year,
2976560	2979040	they'll just do it at the DNC.
2979040	2980280	You remember he did the weird thing
2980280	2984000	where he kind of rebuffed Bill Clinton a little bit
2984000	2988120	and aggressively made out with his wife, Al Gore.
2988120	2989120	I don't remember that,
2989120	2990960	but I'm gonna look it up after this show.
2990960	2994440	It was kind of a like, I'm Al Gore and I live my wife.
2994440	2997840	You know, that guy doesn't love his wife.
2997840	2999080	I'm a wife guy.
2999080	3001360	Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
3001360	3004280	So, you know, I think that in this environment
3004280	3005160	that's so hollowed out,
3005160	3007360	one, it means that even a group as small
3007360	3010840	as Democratic Socialist America or other small groups
3010840	3013480	like Justice Democrats or Sunrise
3013480	3016360	can actually make a difference because,
3016360	3018160	and on the other side,
3018160	3021280	obviously the anti-abortion activists
3021280	3022120	and the Christian right
3022120	3023920	can kind of make a huge difference too.
3023920	3028000	With a small group of highly motivated organizers
3028000	3029560	in a hollowed out political environment
3029560	3031560	can have disproportionate influence.
3031560	3035000	But I think that the goal of campaigns
3035000	3037040	like the Sanders campaign has to be
3037040	3039960	to spur people out of this malaise,
3039960	3042160	then get them motivated and activated
3042160	3044600	and give them a language that they could use,
3044600	3045680	a framework that they could use,
3045680	3048040	a set of demands that they can identify with.
3048040	3053040	Where Bernie failed was that he wasn't successfully able
3053120	3057760	to carry on his campaign even in a limited form
3057760	3059240	through some permanent organ.
3059240	3062400	So in other words, he tried to do our revolution
3062400	3063440	which kind of went nowhere
3063440	3066000	and he tried to do these other efforts
3066000	3067480	to make his campaign permanent.
3067480	3069760	But that's not something he was particularly good at.
3069760	3072280	So it was up to us on the far left
3072280	3075920	to build organizations like the Democratic Social for America.
3075920	3079360	Whereas I think that socials politics in America
3079360	3081520	is obviously what I believe in, I think it's important.
3081520	3083960	But I think there's probably a broader base
3083960	3088440	of for egalitarian, pro-working class politics in America
3088440	3093080	that uses probably is more ideologically diffuse
3093080	3096780	and also uses a different sort of language
3096780	3099600	than the socials left does in the United States.
3099600	3103160	But that fundamentally stands for a fairer deal
3103160	3106840	for working class people and stands for defense
3106840	3111480	and expansion of important social programs
3111480	3113440	like Medicare for all.
3113440	3115800	When you say a different sort of language
3115800	3117080	than the socialists left,
3117080	3119080	what do you mean than the current socialists left?
3119080	3121880	Well, I think the socialists left right now,
3121880	3126720	we are activists but without a huge social base.
3126720	3129360	So a lot of us come from working class backgrounds
3129360	3132560	and a lot of us are involved in campaigns
3132560	3135000	that do connect with a lot of working class people.
3135000	3138380	Like for example, there's a lot of DSA members
3138380	3140920	who are actively involved in tenant rights struggles
3140920	3144360	that do have an important base.
3144360	3149360	But fundamentally we join DSA in ones and twos.
3149800	3153960	So we often create a hot house
3153960	3158700	where certain language and ideological distinctions
3158700	3161620	that are not really that important or consequential
3161620	3165660	to people's lives day to day take on greater consequence.
3165660	3167140	Right.
3167140	3168740	A lot of people reading books
3168740	3171500	and getting very heated about them in closed door meetings
3171500	3172820	is what you're talking about.
3172820	3176380	Yeah, I wish the meetings were closed doors.
3176380	3180140	So sometimes they go viral, yeah.
3180140	3182780	The interesting arguments, yeah.
3184260	3187180	And again, I think building a base of cadre
3187180	3192180	to think about some of these more theoretical points
3192500	3195380	or are committed or keep alive some of this whole language.
3195380	3198100	I actually think it's useful in certain ways.
3198100	3202060	But if you're not connected to a real social base,
3202060	3206020	you're not challenged to try to articulate your ideas
3206020	3208140	in a way every single day,
3208140	3212940	in a way that wins over ordinary Americans
3212940	3215420	and all their complexities.
3215860	3217820	So I think that's the...
3220740	3224900	Yang to Trump to back to Yang to now RFK,
3226260	3228580	junior curious teamster.
3228580	3230460	Like literally someone I spoke to yesterday.
3230460	3231300	So...
3231300	3232140	Right.
3233140	3235180	And who's a person of color, by the way, which makes it...
3235180	3236020	Yeah.
3236020	3237420	I think that's a lot of this election
3237420	3243420	because even a lot of our priors about Hispanic voters
3243620	3246900	vis-a-vis Trump is not gonna be true in this election either.
3246900	3248820	And the RFK junior factor is something
3248820	3251060	that I personally just have not considered much
3251060	3252100	until recently.
3252100	3253940	Now it just seems like he's not gonna go away
3253940	3256340	and he's gonna get his 15%
3256340	3259540	and maybe I'm just hoping only eight of those 15
3259540	3262020	will be from Biden and the rest will be from Trump.
3262020	3263540	You think he's gonna get 15,
3263540	3266740	you think RFK is gonna get 15% of the popular vote?
3266740	3269820	I think that, well, a lot of, I think,
3269820	3271580	polling would have him close to that.
3271580	3274420	I think in reality, as we closer to the election,
3274420	3276300	it'll become more and more polarized.
3276300	3281300	I think that that RFK vote will dissipate back
3281380	3285060	to both Trumps, probably 55% of it might go to Biden,
3285060	3286940	the rest will go to Trump.
3286940	3291540	And I think that the best bet,
3291540	3292780	I'm one of the few people,
3292780	3294740	and I feel like the few people in the world
3294740	3296420	that just thinks that Biden's gonna win,
3296420	3300260	if only because I feel like he's been hit so hard
3300300	3302460	with all these negatives for so many months
3302460	3304980	that it's only gonna go up from here.
3304980	3307780	And Trump between his legal trouble
3307780	3311380	and between just the sheer amount of vitriol
3311380	3313620	that a portion of Americans have for him,
3313620	3317460	I just feel like the negative polarization
3317460	3321420	is people like to call it of the race.
3321420	3324020	Well, we'll skew in Biden's favor
3324020	3325820	because we already lived through Trump
3325820	3328180	and we have, I think, concerns
3328180	3332860	that the next four years of Trump would be even worse.
3332860	3336060	And I just feel like that's the thing
3336060	3339140	that'll motivate people who are quite discontent
3339140	3341900	with Biden, like myself, to vote for him.
3341900	3344660	And I would vote for Biden if I was in a swing state.
3344660	3348380	I'm in New York, so I'll vote for Jill Stein or something.
3349940	3351580	You know why I vote for Jill Stein?
3351580	3353020	Because Jill Stein asked me,
3353020	3355780	hey, Basker, are you gonna vote for me in 2016?
3355780	3356780	I'm like, when?
3356780	3358260	No one else hit me up.
3358260	3359820	I'm not sure if it's an effective way
3359820	3362660	to win a national campaign.
3363820	3365700	She personally asked you.
3365700	3366620	Yeah, yeah.
3366620	3369820	Well, okay, but some people will say,
3369820	3371820	and let's go back.
3371820	3373460	Oh, actually, before I get to that,
3373460	3375860	I do wanna make one point that you were talking about
3375860	3380660	somebody who speaks to an actual group of working people
3380660	3382300	that reminds you of, say, Sean Fain,
3382300	3384700	who is saying a lot of those ideas,
3384700	3387420	why do we even have billionaires, et cetera,
3387420	3389340	things that maybe Bernie could have said,
3389340	3391380	or that a DSA leader would say,
3391380	3394420	but he's saying them to his actual members,
3394420	3397780	who he understands, he knows them well,
3397780	3399700	and he's trying to get them to go on strike
3399700	3402820	or sign a union card or whatever it is,
3402820	3405940	and that's really rooted to their struggle.
3405940	3410940	It's not someone like myself at a DSA meeting
3411260	3412580	with a college education saying,
3412580	3413780	hey, here's what I think would be good
3413780	3416660	for some people who I haven't met, for example,
3416660	3420340	and that's a real difference that is meaningful, perhaps.
3421660	3423820	Going back to the national election, though,
3423820	3428820	you, there were people who said the same thing
3429460	3431060	that you just said, I'll vote for Jill Stein
3431060	3434020	because I'm pretty sure that Biden's gonna win.
3434020	3435980	You did say you'd vote for him if you lived in a swing state,
3435980	3438460	but there are people who said similar things in 2016,
3438460	3439780	and other people are very mad at them
3439780	3441940	because everyone thought Hillary Clinton was gonna win,
3442060	3443980	and hey, I can just, you know,
3443980	3446940	I can do whatever I want, right, for that reason.
3447860	3451380	And I think this year,
3451380	3454380	something that is really going to give Biden
3454380	3458020	a lot of trouble is what's happening in Gaza right now,
3458020	3460540	the support for Israel, et cetera,
3460540	3462860	and it strikes me that this has been
3462860	3466220	such a wedge through the entire left.
3466220	3470340	The, you know, you had DSA members writing an open letter
3470340	3471900	about why they're leaving DSA,
3471900	3474260	because of, da-da-da-da-da-da, go down, you know,
3474260	3476380	they wrote their DSA national leadership,
3476380	3480780	put out a message that was, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
3480780	3483260	You've had this happen at, you know,
3483260	3486980	leftist groups and meetings throughout the country
3486980	3489420	in local democratic parties, et cetera.
3490860	3492780	And, you know, I've heard a lot of people say,
3492780	3496220	hey, this is, regardless of how you feel about that,
3496220	3498060	we are talking about, you know,
3498060	3500320	we're talking about America's economic needs, right,
3500320	3501960	and building socialism in America.
3501960	3505080	This is a, you know, maybe this is not a distraction
3505080	3507000	because we are a part of what's happening in Israel,
3507000	3511120	but it's a very, you know, it's such a wrench
3511120	3513640	to be thrown in at such a vulnerable moment.
3514560	3517200	And so I'm curious to get into that piece of it.
3517200	3520720	How do you think that the, you know,
3520720	3524040	Israel's offensive against the civilians in Gaza
3524040	3527200	has affected your movement?
3528200	3530800	Well, I think among DSA, if anything,
3531840	3536560	having the focal point of solidarity work with Palestine
3536560	3541560	has been a uniting factor in the organization as a whole.
3541640	3543600	I think there's some older members who objected
3543600	3546920	to some of the rhetoric used right after
3546920	3549040	the October 7th attacks.
3549040	3551640	And I think their argument was basically,
3551640	3556640	you're using a rhetoric that is preemptively condemning
3557880	3562880	Israel for the response rather than focusing on
3563080	3566840	the actual attack in which hundreds of civilians died,
3566840	3569000	and also using rhetoric in some cases
3569000	3570880	that maybe it was more appropriate
3570880	3574720	to national liberation movements in the 60s and 70s
3574720	3579560	than it is to an Islamist group like Hamas.
3579560	3584560	I think that obviously I try to aim for some of the,
3585440	3588680	in general, try to aim for a broad-based rhetoric
3588680	3591040	that tries to speak beyond the converted.
3591040	3593160	So I think there's probably some truth in that
3593160	3594600	and some of the initial communications.
3594600	3597320	But as a whole, I think in a moral and ethical sense,
3597320	3600120	I think DSA kind of got it right,
3600120	3604360	which is that there was definitely going to be
3604360	3607600	a huge and disproportionate Israeli response
3607600	3611040	on a largely civilian population.
3611040	3616040	And I think a lot of the Democratic Party,
3616600	3618960	particularly younger Democrats,
3618960	3622560	much less the far left, are united in thinking
3622560	3624760	that Israel's actions have been disproportionate,
3624760	3626040	that it's targeted civilians,
3626040	3628960	and that there needs to be an immediate ceasefire.
3628960	3631000	I think they were even hearing those sorts of things
3631000	3633760	in tepid ways from the Biden administration itself
3633760	3636600	or firm figures within the State Department,
3636600	3641600	which shows a pretty wide spectrum of belief.
3645760	3650280	So I do think that Biden hasn't exhibited
3650280	3652560	the courage that he needed to.
3652560	3655080	I think he's done just enough
3655080	3659240	that history won't say that he was Netanyahu.
3659240	3663240	And I think that's honestly been his goal.
3663240	3666280	He hasn't been, he's been probably thinking himself,
3666360	3668840	well, I don't want to spend enough capital to end this
3668840	3670760	because the last time I spent a lot of capital
3670760	3672280	on a foreign policy issue,
3672280	3675840	his correct decision to withdraw from Afghanistan,
3675840	3677360	I got so much flack for it,
3677360	3679480	but I also don't want people to think of Netanyahu,
3679480	3682720	so I'm going to do the various, the hot mic moment,
3682720	3684200	which I actually do as a hot,
3684200	3685760	do you think was a hot mic moment,
3685760	3687880	but it might as well have been staged
3687880	3689120	at the State of the Union?
3689120	3690400	This is where he was like,
3690400	3692840	ah, man, maybe he's got to cut that out, man,
3692840	3695480	or whatever, like to somebody off the mic, yeah.
3695480	3697840	Well, and he managed to just make it as awkward as possible
3697840	3698640	because he's Biden,
3698640	3700640	so he's talking about a Jewish Prime Minister.
3700640	3703240	So he's like, I need to have a come to Jesus moment for Bibi.
3703240	3709840	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
3709840	3711400	Is there a Jewish,
3711400	3714320	is there a Jewish counterpart to the phrase come to Jesus?
3714320	3716280	Neither of us are the ones to answer that question,
3716280	3718240	but I'm curious anyway, please go on.
3718240	3719480	No, but I think, I think,
3719480	3724800	I think that that hopefully, as time goes on,
3726280	3732760	that those efforts accelerate and there is some sort of resolution. But I think this is something
3732760	3737640	that history will really condemn Biden and his administration for. I think that you can count
3737640	3743480	in the thousands of lives the amount of people that would have been saved if Biden has had acted
3743480	3751240	sooner. And again, even from the narrow standpoint of Israeli defense, I don't think there's a
3751240	3758600	credible argument that killing several thousand more civilians in the operation is going to make
3758600	3769880	Israel safer as opposed to continuing the conflict and perpetuity. And that being said,
3769880	3775880	I actually am not of the opinion that Biden's actions will be a decisive
3776840	3788840	factor in the race in November 2024, I think. Really? And I say this with using my words
3788840	3793080	carefully. I don't think this is a good thing, but I do think that a lot of voters,
3794280	3802040	if the Israeli assault ends in the next month or two, a lot of voters will move on by then.
3802920	3809720	And again, I don't think they should, especially with 30 plus thousand people dead. But I think
3809720	3815640	they will move on for them. The news cycle will move on like we've seen time and time again in
3815640	3824840	these sorts of cases. And also the real politic will overwhelm people. And some of this is very
3824840	3831640	rational. We choose once over four years not who we want to be in charge in a positive sense,
3831640	3836840	but we often have to choose who we are on the far left, who we want to be in opposition to,
3838200	3844360	or for ordinary people like who's the lesser evil. And I think that for a lot of people,
3844360	3852520	that's going to be Joe Biden. And I think among a lot of voters in places like Michigan,
3852520	3860680	I think they're going to feel the pressure to vote for Biden. I think given the constraints of our
3861960	3867000	of our political system, it makes perfect sense that those people would vote for Biden.
3867640	3874600	Then again, I do feel like the credible threat of exit is an important way to actually influence
3875400	3879960	mainstream Democratic Party politicians. And that's attention. That's a balancing act between
3880760	3885480	listening to people's concerns about a Trump, a second presidency, but also wanting to be
3885480	3890440	oppositional enough that we could actually be a pressure group from the outside.
3891000	3898840	And I think that DSA members at an individual level in the organization has tried to do that
3898840	3908600	balancing act. And sometimes I think they don't get enough credit for how well they're doing that.
3908600	3916360	I think the DSA, no endorsement is in and of itself not allowing members to do what they want
3916360	3919960	and to make their own decisions. And the vast majority of those members will vote for Biden
3919960	3926040	in swing states, but it also maintains DSA as a credible oppositional force in a Democratic Party
3926040	3929800	that really does need one in an American civil society that does need one.
3930440	3936760	I really appreciate your description of it as a balancing act, because there's a constant tension
3936760	3943080	between, you know, when folks say, I can never vote for Biden because of his support for Netanyahu
3943080	3947480	or the United States' material support to Israel. Well, that's something that you have to accept.
3947480	3952280	And yet you're like, well, hold on a second, there are two alternatives here. And, you know,
3952280	3959320	we don't want the worse of the two. But if you go vote blue, no matter who, then you remove the
3959320	3966760	ability to put any pressure on. And so you do need to find, like both things are true at once,
3966760	3975240	and you need to find a middle between them. And I agree that I have seen some DSA groups,
3975240	3981160	I think, being sophisticated politically in how they handle it. I guess my broader concern
3981880	3989000	when, you know, apart from my deep concern for everybody in that region and for the citizens
3989000	3994280	of Gaza, when all of that went down, and my concern about those specific policies was
3995000	4001720	the left has a reputation and a history of splintering throughout groups, not limited to DSA,
4001720	4007960	throughout its history. And I saw splintering happen just in my own political waters here in
4007960	4012920	Los Angeles, splintering occurred. People who had previously been in coalition in the movement
4012920	4018520	with each other suddenly said, I can never fuck with those people again. And, you know, on both
4018520	4023720	sides of that. And, you know, if you are interested in political change and you understand, hey, that
4023720	4030280	requires everyone to get on the same side, or everyone to push in the same direction, regardless
4030280	4035560	of your feelings of the actual policy, like to see the splintering can be difficult and lamentable.
4035560	4041960	And so I'm curious how you think about that broader issue within left politics of, you know,
4041960	4046600	backbiting, people will complain about purity testing. I don't really like that phrase, but
4046600	4052120	that's a common complaint that you hear, etc. That sort of perennial problem and how can the
4052120	4058680	left overcome it? Well, I think that the splintering is pretty common in a lot of
4059000	4066120	of like-minded ideological groups or even just groups in general. We just happen to live in
4066120	4073240	society where there isn't that much organized activity anymore. This is the old kind of Putnam,
4073240	4079720	like bowling alone description of how it out or our socialized and our socialized.
4079720	4084840	This book has come up on this show so many times. At some point, I got to get, he's not dead, is he?
4084840	4087560	I got to get him on the show to talk about it, because it's come up over and over again.
4088040	4092440	I think Robert Putnam is still around, but he must be pretty old by this point.
4095640	4100520	He's around. I take credit. I don't take credit. Jackabin, I think, should take some credit for
4100520	4105480	its resurrection because we published a few articles about it a couple of years ago. So I
4105480	4112600	think we got some of the left talking about it. But if you look at the history of the American
4112600	4117160	political right, if you look at the history of religious groups, especially a lot of the words
4117240	4125320	we use to describe the left, like sectarianism, where does this come from? This comes from the
4125320	4131640	million different splits of religious groups into sectarian groups. I think in general,
4132680	4140680	it's something that I personally like to avoid. I like to try to be one ecumenical, but have my
4140680	4145880	beliefs, but figure out how do you create a box where we could have different ideas and have
4145880	4150520	contestation within that box. But like you said, still move together in the same direction,
4150520	4158680	and that's different than a line. A box has room for eclectic decisions and debates
4158680	4164280	over tactics and strategy. But as long as you figure out here are five core principles,
4164280	4168440	here's where we're aligned on, then we can move forward. I think sometimes when it comes to
4169240	4174920	an issue like Israel, Palestine, I think if our demand right now is ceasefire now,
4174920	4179160	I think that is a pretty broad demand that can incorporate a lot of different voices,
4179160	4187000	including liberal Zionists and others. Everyone from liberal Zionists to revolutionaries to
4189000	4193080	people who believe in democratic one state, I think we can all be in that tent together and we
4193080	4206600	can decide, debate 67 versus 48 versus one state solution some other time or within that tent.
4207240	4212760	So I actually think that the left in general has done a pretty good job in being led by groups,
4213720	4218040	like the solidarity movement. A lot of the great actions have been by groups like Jewish
4218040	4223880	voices for peace that have abused, I think really inclusive rhetoric and have talked about the fact
4223880	4230600	that their core members are Jewish Americans and here's why they're concerned by Israel's
4231240	4237640	actions. And I think, again, that's different than having a left that was so pure that said,
4238280	4244280	you can't say one word about Israeli civilians or you can't say one word about
4244840	4252280	two states or whatever. And if you say that, you can't be part of our ceasefire now movement.
4252280	4257400	If it was like that, then I would say that we're in a moment that's too sectarian.
4258440	4264840	I think that for now, the rhetoric I think is very good, the demand is broad and also the
4264840	4271160	rhetoric is about our basic human values. It's about the right of children to have access to
4271160	4277480	nutrition and people to not be under siege and against collective punishment, things that I
4277480	4281080	think are really broad. But going back to you mentioned Sean Finn before, and I think that
4281080	4288440	part of his appeal is that he's both a leader in the labor movement. He's both someone with a huge
4288440	4295800	base of support through the UAW with ordinary working class people, but also he draws on his
4295800	4301400	Christian values when he talks about his socialist values, when he talks about being an egalitarian
4302280	4309800	and when he talks about where wealth comes from and how the fruits of one's labor should be
4309800	4315480	distributed. And I think that's really powerful. And when I think about what kind of left wing
4315480	4321560	rhetoric can actually reach 100, 200 million Americans, I would imagine that sounds something
4322120	4329320	like that. I agree with that. And looking forward is how I'd like to end here. You opened by saying
4329880	4335240	over the last 10 years, moved from socialism being dead to being on life support. First of all,
4335240	4339000	that's pretty impressive because a resurrection happened in the middle there, which is a miracle.
4339000	4345320	So let's say that's an accomplishment for your movement. I would love you for you to paint a
4345320	4349400	picture of 10 years from now, right? Because you've said, hey, we need these charismatic leaders.
4349400	4354680	I don't see someone stepping up in electoral politics to take the Bernie Sanders crown currently.
4357320	4362200	No one is running for president this year with that sort of overtly socialist politics.
4365720	4370680	By the way, DSA membership I've read has slightly declined or at least plateaued for a little bit.
4372200	4376200	In terms of growth, after we've seen a lot of growth in the last 10 years,
4376200	4381320	how does the movement continue growing and where do you see it in your rosiest view?
4381320	4388040	Well, my rosiest view, I think that a lot of the younger people who move left on key issues,
4388040	4393960	we could connect with them and get them to engage in politics. And we connect with them. We tell them
4394680	4402760	engaging with politics isn't just about having a persona online or having a set of likes and
4402760	4408280	dislikes, but actually being involved in a union. And if you're in a workplace that is
4408280	4413640	unionized or can't be unionized, it's getting involved in your local community. It's either
4413640	4420040	connecting with groups like DSA or Jewish Worship Peace, some of the far left groups that I mentioned.
4420040	4425160	But it also means for people who maybe have different persuasions politically,
4425160	4432600	connecting with the local, even becoming a delegate at the DNC, something I wouldn't do
4432600	4437720	in a thousand years. And my mind isn't worth my time. But for other people, that might be how
4438680	4443240	they connect with politics. Look, taking over your local chapter of your local party is very
4443240	4447640	powerful politically. You have to sit through a lot of really shitty meetings. But you show up
4447640	4450280	to another of those meetings, you could be running the place within a couple of years.
4450840	4461880	Yeah, or getting involved with your local abortion access campaign or a host of things,
4461880	4467080	but still identifying broadly as being on the left or being part of any egalitarian
4467960	4474680	current. And a current that basically says we don't want a world where people get by and get ahead
4474680	4482440	through bullying or where we allow people to achieve exalted positions by being bullied.
4483000	4489320	We want a world in which ordinary people can work hard and be able to take care of themselves
4489320	4498200	and their families. And to me, like Trump embodies the very worst of Americans. One is like personally
4498200	4505240	pretty detestable. Even though he's occasionally funny, we could acknowledge. He's someone who just
4506200	4513080	constantly brags about being a bully. And his version of dealmaking is zero sum. Whereas I think
4513080	4520280	our vision for the United States, for the world is a very positive sum vision of expanding justice
4520280	4526120	and expanding prosperity and the world being a better place. And I think that's a message that
4527080	4531800	60 percent of the United States and 60 percent of the world can get behind. I don't think we'll
4531800	4537720	ever get a full 100. But I think that that appeal for that is far greater than where their DSA,
4537720	4543320	I think we have declined about 85,000 or 100,000. Either way, it's a country of 330 million people.
4543320	4548440	So I think this broad based movement in which I think socialists have a really important role to
4548520	4557800	play. Connecting, I think, these values, which are really commonly shared with the idea of struggle.
4557800	4563560	Because struggle means that it's not just we have this nice set of shared values we can all
4563560	4570040	march towards. But there is a small minority of people who do have a vested interest in keeping
4570040	4576280	people divided and keeping everything from our workplaces structured as undemocratically as they
4576280	4583240	are to our tax code written in the way it's written. And that's I think what liberalism is
4583240	4590360	often missed, this theory of politics and these theories of conflict. So I would love socialism
4590360	4596760	to be a complementary piece of the puzzle, changing liberalism. And then in turn, being
4596760	4602600	shaped by the people we're interacting with who aren't socialists, I think there's really a broad
4602600	4608360	movement that we can build in the here and now. Yeah. And I've seen that happen. I mean, in the
4608360	4614440	writer's guild, in the writer's strike, we have 10,000 to 12,000 members, depending on how you
4614440	4620760	want to count. And there are genuinely folks from all political persuasions. There are Republicans
4620760	4626360	and Democrats and all other sorts of folks in the union. But the one thing that almost everyone in
4626360	4633240	the union 95%, 99% of people in the union agree on is that the bosses are trying to screw us and
4633240	4638920	then if we fight back, we can win. And so there's people who I know I disagree with them politically
4638920	4643720	on many things, but we march together in solidarity and we know that we stand there going, hey, but
4643720	4649800	we're doing this together right now. And that feels more important, more powerful and separate
4649880	4658440	from who we voted for for governor or whatever. Or what cable news channel we watch. It's a
4658440	4667400	politics that we live rather than simply identify with and click a button about. And the fact that
4667400	4674520	so many people responded to it around the country. And in my view, the reason our strike went viral
4674520	4679160	nationally was people watched it and said, I want to do that too. I faced that in my job. How do I
4679160	4686520	do that in my life? That to me was really evidence. These are ideas and a struggle with a broad appeal
4686520	4691000	if we can fucking figure out how to harness it. Yeah, I think you, you proved it through practice
4691000	4697240	too. You had your theory that we can make change. You brought together a diverse coalition to make
4697240	4702120	change and people saw the results. So now it's going to be easier the next time around. Now,
4702120	4708920	with the Bernie campaign, with all these other struggles, the key is to actually rack up victories
4708920	4713560	and to give people a sense that politics isn't just something I'm going to do for fun
4713560	4720280	when I have free time between the ages of 18 and 26, the time in our lives where we have the,
4720920	4726200	for many of us, the most free time, but that it's actually an important route to achieve tangible
4726200	4731080	victories. And it's something that we can continue in various forms throughout our lives. And I think
4731080	4738440	that's the goal of any broad left movement is to achieve some victories and then add on to the
4739000	4743960	victories. Well, I feel badly that we have talked for over an hour and I haven't even gotten into
4743960	4750200	your publishing work. So let's end there and tell me a little bit about where people can find the
4750200	4755640	work that you do at The Nation and at Jacobin and, you know, the importance of that work as your
4755640	4762440	final plug and telling us about what you do. Well, I'm the president of The Nation magazine,
4762520	4766280	which is kind of a ridiculous title, but basically the publisher of The Nation.
4766280	4772920	You're literally, it's called The Nation. You're the president. You're the potus.
4772920	4774760	You're the panodist. I don't know, there's something in there.
4777960	4783560	And The Nation has been around since 1865. So it was founded by abolitionists in 1865. It's a
4783560	4788680	longest standing, you know, liberal left publication in this country. It's been
4789400	4796040	generally on the right side of history. All those years, 165 years on questions of
4796040	4802680	one piece in the like 159 years. That was pretty bad. I'm still living in the past. In my mind,
4802680	4810680	it's, you know, it's not 2024. But I'm also the founding editor of Jack from Magazine,
4810680	4815480	which is a quarterly magazine. I think for my money, it's the best looking publication in the
4815480	4819400	entire country. The design is incredible of this magazine. Like, it's like, you want to cut the
4819400	4824280	pages out and put them on the wall. I subscribed for one year just to get the print product and
4824280	4830840	it truly is beautiful. And yeah, I'm also working on a few books, but my last one was The Socialist
4830840	4839320	Manifesto, which yeah, as I work on my second book now, I'm not sure how I managed to write a book
4839320	4844680	in the past. Like, this is like, you know, five, six years ago. So there were still smartphones
4844680	4849160	and all these distractions. But for some reason, it was a lot easier than now.
4850680	4854200	Well, I look forward to the new book. And thank you so much for coming on this show,
4854200	4857960	Bosker. It's been incredible talking to you. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
