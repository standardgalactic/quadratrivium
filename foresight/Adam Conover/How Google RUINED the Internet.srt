1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Have you noticed that lately Google sucks ass?

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,440
It was supposed to be the greatest information retrieval tool in history.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,920
But now, even when you search for something basic,

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,520
the results are full of AI garbage, fake product reviews,

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,760
and so many ads you might as well send your search query straight to the spam bots.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
It's gotten so bad that now I literally add a Reddit to my search terms

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,080
because at least that way the garbage I get back was written by actual human dorks.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,880
Well, you're not making it up.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,520
A recent study found that higher ranked pages aren't on average more search engine optimized,

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,080
more monetized with affiliate marketing and show signs of lower text quality.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,280
That means the higher a page is ranked on Google, the worse it literally is.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,080
But you know what?

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,640
According to the study, it's not just Google.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,160
It's every search engine,

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,280
which means the internet itself is actually getting worse right before our eyes.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,000
So what the hell happened?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,920
How did the internet turn from the modern library of Alexandria

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,120
into a free little library full of dog dookie?

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,640
Well, the answer is that it's all Google's fault.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,800
In this video, I'm going to tell the story of how a scrappy little search engine that pledged

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,920
not to be evil became a ruthless monopoly that not only ruined their own core product,

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,360
but turned the entire internet into an endless river of shit.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,360
But first, I'd like to thank DeleteMe for sponsoring this video.

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,840
And second, I know one corner of the internet that isn't shit, our Patreon community.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,720
Head to Patreon.com slash Adam Conover, and you can support this show and join a community

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,880
of smart, curious people who love to talk about how screwed up the world is.

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,040
Plus, you get every monologue and podcast episode I put out ad free.

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,680
Head to Patreon.com slash Adam Conover to join us.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,880
We'd love to have you.

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,160
And as always, if you want to come see me do stand up comedy on the road,

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,280
head to AdamConover.net for tickets and tour dates.

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,200
You know, I'm old enough to remember the magical early years of the internet.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,880
You'd wait for your mom to hang up on Aunt Barbara, fire up your compact

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,320
Presario's 2400 Bod modem, and boom, you'd be on the worldwide web.

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,560
An entire new digital universe full of people from all over the globe,

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,240
publishing fascinating things.

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,040
Just one problem, there was no way to find any of it because search engines back then

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
did not work at all.

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,760
Altavista, Lycos, that fancy pants butler with the shitting smirk on his face.

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,360
The results they'd give you were useless and random.

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,520
You'd type Stone Cold Steve Austin and it'd give you the weather report for Texas.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,120
One time I searched how to tie a tie on Lycos and the little dog took a dump on my desktop.

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,600
I'm not kidding. That really happened to me.

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,440
But then in 1998, two engineers named Sergei Brin and Larry Page came up with an amazing

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,040
new invention, a search engine that actually worked.

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
It was called Back Rub.

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,560
And then when they realized that sounded a little bit too much like low-grade sexual

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,800
harassment, they changed the name to Google.

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,840
Google used the fundamental structure of the web itself, the links between pages,

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,760
to figure out with e-reaccuracy which pages were the most relevant.

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,400
And I really cannot overemphasize what a big deal it was in 1998 to get real information this quickly.

52
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,560
It was the second best form of Instagramification a teenage boy could get his hands on.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
And it helped you find the first a lot more quickly.

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,800
Even better, Google pledged that they were a new kind of tech company,

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,320
one that actually wanted to make the internet a better place.

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,640
In fact, their company motto was literally don't be evil.

57
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,880
Oh look, they even put it on the wall so employees could walk up and stare at it.

58
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,040
Well, someone should warn Mr. Shorts and Sandals at work there because in the years since,

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,800
it's gotten pretty evil.

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,160
Over the past two decades, Google results have gone from this,

61
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,880
simple, streamlined, as clean and clear as the acne face wash I was using back then,

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,000
to an oily, disgusting mess covered with ads, shopping referral links,

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,160
and YouTube videos that, surprise, surprise, also play ads.

64
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,800
Google's interface is now so crammed with advertising that a Washington Post report

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,920
found you now have to scroll six times further down the page to get to the first real unpaid

66
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
link to an outside website.

67
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,760
It's like if in order to cross a bridge, you first had to drive your car into sh** river.

68
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,360
So why would Google purposefully make their revolutionary

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,480
industry defining search engine worse and harder to use?

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,920
Simple.

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,680
It's because at the end of the day, Google isn't a search company at all.

72
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,920
It's also not an email company, a video company, or a smartphone company.

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,240
It's an advertising company.

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,720
See, Google could have come up with a business model that put our needs first.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
They could have allowed us to pay them for a better class of service,

76
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
or sold autograph prints of the Google Doodle or whatever.

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,800
But no, they chose a different path, one in which you are not the customer at all.

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,040
Instead, you are the product.

79
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,080
Because Google's real revenue source is selling you and all the data they have on you to advertisers.

80
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,240
Google themselves say that we earn most of our money by showing ads.

81
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,440
Huh, I think most might be a little bit of an understatement.

82
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,040
Let's check the actual number.

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,240
Oh, okay.

84
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,760
In 2023, advertisers paid Google $237 billion.

85
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,120
Is your broke a**pan Google $237 billion a year?

86
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,400
Mine sure isn't.

87
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,640
That means that Google's real job is keeping Pfizer and Johnny Spamalot happy, not you.

88
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,240
And that objectively makes Google worse.

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,400
According to two researchers at Stanford,

90
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,280
advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.

91
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,920
And we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased

92
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,280
towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.

93
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,800
You know who wrote those words?

94
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,520
It was Sergei Brin and Larry Page, the founders of Google.

95
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,880
They wrote those words in 1998 in the famous paper that introduced Google.

96
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,880
These motherf**kers knew the entire time that selling ads was the original

97
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,280
sin of search engines and would ruin their product.

98
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,320
But you know what they did?

99
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,040
They backed up the money truck anyway and buried their principles in a giant pile of cash.

100
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,400
In the years since, Google has steadily worked to make their search engine better for advertisers

101
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,080
and worse for you.

102
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,320
They made it harder to tell the difference between an ad and a real link.

103
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,440
They cut thousands of search quality raters whose job it was to make sure Google's results

104
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,800
are high quality and they demoted their head of search.

105
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,880
An original engineer who helped build the search engine and spent decades

106
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,400
making sure it was fast and effective and replaced him with the head of the advertising department.

107
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,120
That's right, the most important widely used information retrieval tool on earth

108
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,480
is now being run by the guy from the f**king spam department.

109
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,120
The fact that as citizens, the main tool we use to get information about the world,

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,080
our political system, about our own health, is an algorithm run by the world's largest

111
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,440
advertising company is supremely f**ked up.

112
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,120
It's like getting nutrition tips from Ronald f**king McDonald.

113
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,240
Google tracks you.

114
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,080
They monitor what you do on the internet and then they sell all the data they have on you

115
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,120
to advertisers.

116
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,040
And the worst part is they then use all that money to make sure you have no other choice.

117
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,800
Now, before we get into that, if you want to keep your personal information

118
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,000
off of search engines, you absolutely need to check out delete me.

119
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

120
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,880
I didn't say delete me.

121
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm talking about delete me.

122
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,280
If you've watched this channel before, you know how important information privacy is.

123
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,320
Big tech companies aren't the only ones hoovering up your data.

124
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,960
There are bad actors out there called data brokers who make a living buying and selling

125
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,920
your information.

126
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,680
Delete me's teams of experts scour the web to find and remove your personal information for you

127
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,000
to keep your info out of the clutches of data brokers and keep you safe.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,560
And you know what?

129
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,600
Because I also want to keep my family safe from data brokers.

130
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,440
I am thrilled that delete me now offers family account management.

131
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,200
You can seamlessly add your family members and loved ones to your account,

132
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,400
creating a unified hub for family privacy protection,

133
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,120
complete with unique data sheets per family member.

134
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
That means you can keep your family members safe no matter what their age is,

135
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
whether you're looking to protect your parents or your children,

136
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,040
or maybe parents who behave like children when they get calls from a scammer.

137
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,080
And best of all,

138
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,520
now you can get 20% off your delete me plan when you go to join delete me dot com slash

139
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,400
Adam and use the promo code Adam at checkout.

140
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,800
That's joined delete me dot com slash Adam and use promo code Adam.

141
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay, take me back now.

142
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,280
You know, it wouldn't be that big a deal for Google to suck as hard as it does if there

143
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,640
were another option.

144
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,760
But here's the worst part, Google uses the massive resources they get from selling you

145
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,760
to advertisers to make sure that you have nowhere else to go.

146
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,480
Sure.

147
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,040
At first, Google won the search market fair and square by having the best product.

148
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,120
Altavista went Asta Lavista.

149
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,520
The light ghost dog was sent to a nice farm family upstate and asked Jeeves.

150
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Well, he's not even the logo anymore because he killed himself.

151
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,200
But once they achieved dominance, Google started using their advertising billions

152
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,240
to buy their way to a monopoly so that no one could do to them what they did to poor Jeeves.

153
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,880
Google pays Mozilla upwards of $450 million a year to be the primary search engine in

154
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
the Firefox browser.

155
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,160
And they pay Apple as much as $15 billion a year to be the default search engine in Safari.

156
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,560
That's right, the fruit company is getting more than the entire GDP of Laos just to stop

157
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
you from binging shit.

158
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,080
Of course, Google doesn't have to pay anyone to be the default for the most popular phone

159
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,200
and web browser.

160
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,880
That's because their monopolistic asses already own them.

161
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,520
It can take 15 clicks to change your default search engine on a Google browser.

162
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,440
So most people never bother.

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
These defaults are so powerful in shaping user behavior that Google now owns 90 percent

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,120
of the search market.

165
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,400
And it is almost impossible for new search engines to break in, even if they're actually

166
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,960
better.

167
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,120
In 2018, two former Google employees left the company to build a new, better search engine.

168
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,080
And you know what?

169
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,040
They actually did it.

170
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,560
Their site, Neva, had no ads.

171
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,520
Instead, it focused on getting you actual results as quickly as possible.

172
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,000
And almost everyone who tried it thought it was better than Google in every way.

173
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,120
But when you're fighting against a monopolist, being the best isn't good enough.

174
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,880
Neva found that Google's default position in almost every browser was so entrenched and

175
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,720
powerful, it was impossible to get people to switch to or even try their search engine.

176
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,400
And since they didn't have 15 billion dollars to pay off Tim Cook,

177
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,160
after a few years, they shut down just another corpse buried in Google's basement.

178
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,240
So why does Google suck now?

179
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,920
Well, why would they bother to make their search engine work better

180
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,760
when they can just buy their way to being the only search engine?

181
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,360
But hey, I know what you're thinking.

182
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,840
There's a couple other teeny tiny search engines out there.

183
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,400
There's Bing.

184
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,760
There's DuckDuckGo.

185
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,360
And hey, you're a tech savvy millennial.

186
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,840
You'll just change your default search engine and go back to petting doggos laughing emoji.

187
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,920
But here's the real problem.

188
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,040
No matter what search engine you use, your search results are still going to suck.

189
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,400
Because Google is now so dominant, so powerful that their choices shape the very internet itself.

190
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,720
See, if you're not in the top Google results for a certain search term,

191
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,200
your website is basically invisible.

192
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,000
So a powerful industry of search engine optimization, or SEO,

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,320
has sprung up to help publishers sleaze their way to the top of the results.

194
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,800
SEO is the process of gaming Google search algorithm,

195
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,040
giving it exactly what it wants so that it always displays your page first,

196
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,520
regardless of whether or not it's actually the best.

197
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,000
Google actually encourages publishers to use SEO techniques.

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,120
The problem, though, is that using these techniques generally makes your website suck ass.

199
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,880
So there's this website called HouseFresh where experts rigorously test air purifiers

200
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,320
and then publish the results.

201
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,160
That's literally all they do.

202
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,120
They're an example of what the internet was supposed to be.

203
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,880
An independent site run by real experts writing reliable articles that are actually useful.

204
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
And Google is slowly murdering them.

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,760
In a blog post earlier this year, HouseFresh revealed how they were being

206
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,920
massacred in the Google rankings by SEO optimized content farms

207
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,000
that just pretend to review air purifiers to game the algorithm.

208
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,920
The purifiers these sites recommend suck so hard,

209
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,200
actually they don't suck hard.

210
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,760
They suck poorly, that's the point of an air purifier,

211
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,960
that it is obvious that no one involved with these sites

212
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,680
has even seen them in person, much less tested them.

213
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,160
But that doesn't matter because all Google cares about

214
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,000
is that these sites use the keywords rigorous testing and lab team and expert on their pages.

215
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,840
Why spend the money to actually do those things or even buy an air purifier

216
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,760
when you can just tell Google's idiot algorithm the magic fucking words?

217
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Let's be clear, Google's only actual job as a search engine

218
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,560
is to send me to good sites like HouseFresh rather than bullshit spam sites.

219
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,800
But no, Google says here's a piece of shit site that lists some piece of shit products

220
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,080
and it's number one.

221
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,280
Aren't you feeling lucky?

222
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,960
Optimizing your site for Google's algorithm doesn't make it better,

223
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,360
it makes it worse, less readable, less useful, and less honest.

224
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,840
But a site's Google rank has become so existentially important

225
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,760
that now at least 80% of all websites use SEO in some form, 80%.

226
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
That's why every time you look up a recipe now,

227
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,680
it starts with when I started best cooking blog,

228
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,080
I never thought it would really be best cooking blog.

229
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,000
But now people come up to me and say,

230
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,520
wow, you really do have the best cooking blog for best recipes,

231
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,600
tasty recipes, go-to recipes,

232
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,960
and also the best tasty go-to recipes for hungry daughters.

233
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,160
Anyway, I'm going to be sharing my best tasty go-to recipe

234
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,320
for how to hard boil an egg.

235
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,680
First, buy an egg.

236
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,720
When online shopping for best deals on tasty eggs, I...

237
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,960
This fucking sucks.

238
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,760
It doesn't matter what search engine you use

239
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,800
because the entire internet is now just an endless stream

240
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,080
of generic, content-free SEO barf.

241
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,960
And it's all Google's goddamn fault.

242
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,480
They threw up in the pool and we're all swimming in it.

243
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
I mean, the internet was supposed to be

244
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,800
the greatest source of information in the history of humankind.

245
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,400
But Google's monopoly has created a world in which real sites

246
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,720
that employ real journalists, real reviewers,

247
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,440
and real experts shut down every day

248
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,640
because they can't compete with the bullshit content farms

249
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,120
that Google's algorithm promotes instead.

250
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,240
And now, that so-called artificial intelligence

251
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,600
is about to flood the internet with even more dumbass spam?

252
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,880
What is Google doing?

253
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,560
They're jamming AI into the fucking search engine itself.

254
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,800
So now, instead of just serving you the barf,

255
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,280
Google's AI is going to ingest the barf for you,

256
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,560
then barf it back at you in hopes that you'll swallow it down

257
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,480
like some kind of vomit oroborus.

258
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,120
I mean, what the fuck happened to Don't Be Evil?

259
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,440
Did they just take that sign off the wall?

260
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,960
Oh, yeah, they did.

261
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,480
And then they shot that dude in the head.

262
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,720
Google built its fortune on the forest of links,

263
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,080
the deep structure of an internet created by humans.

264
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,080
But after they won, they used their money and power

265
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,040
to destroy that forest and make sure nothing else

266
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,960
could ever grow in its place.

267
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,600
And nothing is more evil than that.

268
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,280
Now, I know that all sounds pretty bleak,

269
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
but there is a way to fix it.

270
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,560
And in fact, the phrase Don't Be Evil

271
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,520
is itself a reference to the last tech monopoly

272
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,640
that we needed to cut down to size, Microsoft.

273
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,400
See, back in the 90s, Microsoft was a ruthless giant

274
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,720
that sought to dominate the computer industry

275
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
and the internet itself.

276
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,080
Everyone hated them.

277
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,800
They were using their monopoly over the operating system,

278
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,080
Windows, to gain an unfair advantage over the internet,

279
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,800
bundling their crappy web browser internet explorer

280
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,960
as the default so that competitors

281
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,400
couldn't break into the market.

282
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,640
And the fear was that if Microsoft was allowed

283
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,280
to establish monopoly control over the software

284
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,880
we used to connect to the web,

285
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,560
they'd be able to kill competition

286
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
across the entire internet.

287
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,040
Microsoft even had internal conversations

288
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,800
in which they discussed directing users

289
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,240
to Microsoft search sites if they typed in Google.com.

290
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,120
Well, you know what happened next?

291
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,360
The federal government sued them

292
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,440
for violating antitrust law.

293
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,920
And even though that case was eventually settled,

294
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,480
just the threat of federal enforcement

295
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,000
actually caused Microsoft to change their business practices.

296
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,840
Microsoft's own lawyers admitted

297
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,240
that the constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper

298
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,040
all the time actually made them behave differently

299
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,080
because no one wanted to test the regulators anymore.

300
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,880
Microsoft stopped trying to monopolize the internet,

301
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,640
giving new startups like Google

302
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
the space they needed to grow and flourish.

303
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,560
That's right.

304
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,280
Google, the biggest of all big tech companies

305
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,160
only exists because the government was willing to step in

306
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,560
and kick some big tech ass.

307
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,680
This is why we need antitrust enforcement.

308
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,360
If monopolistic companies

309
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,920
are allowed to strangle their competitors in the crib

310
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,880
like Microsoft used to do and like Google does today,

311
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,560
they'll never be able to grow up

312
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,120
into those energetic idealistic teenagers

313
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,080
that change the world.

314
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,760
So you know what?

315
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,040
If we want to fix this,

316
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,440
our government needs to get off of its ass

317
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
enforce our antitrust laws

318
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,760
and start punishing the assholes who...

319
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,840
Oh, never mind.

320
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,360
I'm seeing that the Department of Justice

321
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
actually sued Google months ago.

322
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,200
Sorry, force of habit.

323
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm just not used to the government like doing its job ever.

324
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
Hope they win.

325
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,280
And you should too.

326
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,920
Because you know what?

327
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,440
There's tech pundits out there

328
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,080
who will try to tell you that this is government overreach,

329
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,040
that the government shouldn't meddle in big tech.

330
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,800
And that's a lie that we all need to start pushing back on.

331
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,000
Because if we don't,

332
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,360
well, we better all start learning to boil an egg in barf.

333
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,040
Thank you so much for watching

334
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,640
and a special thanks to everybody
